Modified AKMA for Decentralized Authentication in LEO Satellite-Based IoT Networks,"Device authentication in low-Earth orbit (LEO) satellite-based Internet of Things (IoT) networks is critical for enabling secure and reliable communication between remote IoT devices and satellites. It prevents unauthorized access and security breaches. State-of-the-art authentication methods for terrestrial networks, such as authentication and key management for applications (AKMAs), are inadequate when directly applied to such networks because IoT devices have constrained communication and computational capabilities. Further, the satellite environment is highly dynamic, with frequent handovers and variable latency, leading to vulnerabilities like man-in-the-middle (MITM) and spoofing attacks. To address these challenges, we propose a modified AKMA framework for decentralized and continuous authentication in LEO satellite-based IoT networks. Our proposed modification utilizes local key refreshment for seed generation, seed update, and seed refreshment in a decentralized manner, enabling tailored transmission patterns for IoT devices. This reduces the need for repeated authentication attempts with satellites and effectively mitigates handoff-associated threats. We examine the authentication performance of the system in the presence of an illegitimate autonomous aerial vehicle (AAV) above the legitimate IoT devices. Our results through simulations and emulation show improvement in the authentication rate of legitimate IoT devices and a reduction in the misdetection rate of illegitimate AAVs compared to state-of-the-art physical channel-based authentication schemes. Our proposed modified AKMA enables its application in LEO satellite-based IoT networks.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85214480658&origin=inward,IEEE Internet of Things Journal,2025
Energy-Efficient Strategic AAV-Enabled MEC Networks via STAR-RIS: Joint Optimization of Trajectory and User Association,"The deployment of Simultaneously Transmitting and Reflecting Reconfigurable Intelligent Surfaces (STAR-RIS) has proven to be an effective means to extend coverage and improve wireless signal quality. STAR-RIS in wireless networks for aided autonomous aerial vehicle (AAV) communications enables a significant boost in network capacity and the provision of virtual line-of-sight (LoS) links to efficiently meet the quality-of-service (QoS) requirements of user equipment (UE). Accordingly, this article proposes a novel STAR-RIS-aided multi-AAV communication framework to exploit energy efficiency and total throughput maximally. We formulate the long-term optimization problem as a decentralized, partially observed Markov decision process (DEC-POMDP). Then, we formulate the discrete association scheduling problem as a noncooperative theoretical game and propose the UA-CFG algorithm to realize the UE association scheme that converges to a Nash equilibrium (NE). Then, a multiagent reinforcement learning (MARL) method with well-established robustness is devised to continuously optimize the trajectories and energetic consumption of AAVs through centralized training and distributed implementation. Experimental results reveal that the performance of the proposed algorithm is considerable compared to other traditional schemes.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=10833766,IEEE Internet of Things Journal,2025

AoI and Energy-Aware Data Collection for IRS-Assisted UAV-IoT Networks Under Jamming,"With the rapid popularity of autonomous aerial vehicles (AAV)-Internet of Things (IoT) networks, timely and energy-efficient data collection is a critical issue. The strong Line-of-Sight (LoS) communication of UAVs makes them more susceptible to jamming attacks, resulting in increased communication latency and energy consumption (EC). In this article, the problem of jointly minimizing Age of Information (AoI) and EC in data collection under malicious jamming attacks is formulated by optimizing the diagonal phase shift matrix of the intelligent reflective surface (IRS), UAV trajectory, and the transmit powers of IoT devices. The formulated problem is solved by an alternating optimization (AO) scheme. Specifically, we first obtain the closed-form solution of the IRS diagonal phase shift matrix by using the quantitative passive beamforming method. Then, the UAV trajectory is optimized by the variable parameter particle swarm annealing (VPPSA) algorithm, and the suboptimal solution of the transmit powers of IoT devices is obtained by the successive convex approximation (SCA) algorithm. Extensive simulation results demonstrate that the proposed algorithm outperforms the benchmark schemes in terms of AoI and EC.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=10806725,IEEE Internet of Things Journal,2025
Enhancing AAV-Based Industrial Systems With Cognitive IoT: Detecting AI-Manipulated Visual Data Using Graph-Based Methods,"The integration of Cognitive Internet of Things (IoT) sensors with autonomous aerial vehicles (AAVs) has transformed industrial sectors, such as monitoring, logistics, and infrastructure inspection. However, the advancement of visual synthesis technologies like generative adversarial networks and diffusion models has introduced significant risks by enabling the creation of highly realistic AI-manipulated content, making the detection of falsified imagery increasingly challenging. Existing detection methods, largely based on convolutional neural networks (CNNs), focus primarily on global image features and often overlook crucial relational connections, limiting their robustness and generalization. To overcome these limitations, we propose a novel dual-stream architecture that integrates global feature extraction with relational feature learning. By combining the CLIP model with a graph-based topology, our approach identifies hard-to-detect samples and processes them through a graph convolutional network (GCN) to capture both structural and relational information. Extensive evaluations validate the robustness and generalization ability of our method across various generative models and real-world perturbations. This approach offers a scalable and reliable solution to ensure data integrity in industrial IoT systems, helping to preserve societal trust in AI-driven applications.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=105004010769&origin=inward,IEEE Internet of Things Journal,2025

IH-SESD: Modeling Information Hiding With Super-Resolution Enhancement and Significant Region Detection for UAV Networks,"The advent of unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) networks, renowned for their expansive coverage capabilities and heightened adaptability, presents a promising landscape for bolstering the efficacy of Internet of Things (IoT) data transmissions. Nevertheless, the integration of UAVs into IoT ecosystems introduces a spectrum of security challenges, notably data tampering, man-in-the-middle (MitM) attacks, and eavesdropping, which threaten the integrity and confidentiality of transmitted information. Since covert transmission has the characteristics of strong concealment and difficult detection, UAV networks based on information hiding become a new paradigm for solving these security problems. This article proposes an information hiding algorithm based on super-resolution enhancement and significant region detection (IH-SESD). This algorithm incorporates the super-resolution enhanced SRCNN and the U2Net salient region detection technologies. Comprehensive performance analysis and comparisons with existing methods demonstrate the superiority of the proposed IH-SESD algorithm.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85205828658&origin=inward,IEEE Internet of Things Journal,2025
"Decomposition, Synthesis, and Attack: A Multi-Instruction Fusion Method for Jailbreaking LLMs","Large language models (LLMs) can transform natural language instructions into executable commands for IoT devices like autonomous aerial vehicles (AAVs), creating new development opportunities. However, safety concerns about LLMs translating commands into machine or program control instructions cannot be overlooked. Currently, jailbreak instructions used to test the LLM security are often restricted to specific modes or tasks, resulting in a lack of diversity and leaving some tasks unexplored. To address this issue, we introduce a multi-instruction fusion (MIF) method that can automatically fuse harmful prompts and various task instructions into jailbreaks. First, we adopt a reverse decomposition strategy to acquire sufficient supervised data for fusing harmful prompts and harmless task instructions into jailbreaks and construct a task instruction synthesizer based on it. Then, to determine the optimal instruction combinations in the vast combination space, we propose a representative-node-based selection strategy, ReNB, to rank and filter the instruction combinations on a few representative samples, thereby accelerating the identification of the valid ones. Experimental results demonstrate that MIF significantly improves the attack success rate (ASR), achieving over 90% on GPT-4o-mini, LLaMa2-70B, and Qwen2-7B models, outperforming the state-of-the-art (SOTA) baselines.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=105002382748&origin=inward,IEEE Internet of Things Journal,2025
Integrating Reconfigurable Intelligent Surface and AAV for Enhanced Secure Transmissions in IoT-Enabled RSMA Networks,"Autonomous aerial vehicle (AAV)-enabled Internet of Things (IoT) exhibits great application potential with its wide coverage, flexible network topology, and diversified services. However, ensuring communication security and efficient spectrum resource utilization in multiuser access scenarios is challenging, given the open nature of AAV channels and the proliferation of communication devices in IoT. To address the above challenges, this article proposes a novel reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS)-aided AAV collaborative communication framework, where RIS-equipped AAV flexibly serves multiple users. In this work, a rate splitting multiple access (RSMA)-based secure transmission scheme is proposed, where the split public information serves both as useful signals and noise to disrupt eavesdropping. For the proposed scheme, a sum secrecy rate maximization problem is formulated and solved by optimally deploying the AAV’s location, designing the RIS’s phase shift, and power allocation. For this nonconvex problem with a couple of variables, we decompose it and form three separate subissues. Specifically, leveraging the successive convex approximation (SCA) and semidefinite relaxation (SDR) techniques, we first exploit an iterative algorithm for optimizing beamforming vectors and phase-shift matrix of RIS, and the optimal position of the AAV is obtained according to the deep deterministic policy gradient (DDPG). Then, we design an alternating optimization (AO) framework for joint solving. Finally, simulation results validate the efficacy of the proposed scheme in enhancing security, e.g., relative to the nonorthogonal multiple access (NOMA) scheme and benchmark scheme, the secrecy rate of the proposed scheme increased by 29.7% and 71.9%, respectively.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85214316280&origin=inward,IEEE Internet of Things Journal,2025
Secure Data Delivery With Certificateless Homomorphic Network Coding Signature Scheme for Autonomous Aerial Vehicle Networks,"With highly mobile and flexible-configurable, autonomous aerial vehicles (AAVs) are becoming crucial wireless communication infrastructures. To improve the reliability and throughput of data delivery for wireless networks, network coding, as a progressive technology, can be applied in AAV networks. However, network coding incurs a security problem called pollution attacks for AAV networks. Although homomorphic network coding signature can prevent pollution attacks, existing schemes are not suitable for AAV networks due to cumbersome certificate management, the key-escrow issue, or insecurity. In this article, we propose an efficient certificateless homomorphic network coding signature scheme for secure transmission of AAV networks, which can avoid certificate management and the key-escrow issue. Then our scheme is proven to be secure against adaptive chosen identity-and-subspace attacks in the random oracle model, thus our scheme can guarantee data integrity and authenticity to resist pollution attacks. We provide a performance evaluation for the proposed scheme and prior research, and experimental results illustrate the efficiency and feasibility of our scheme for practical application, reducing the verification overhead by 42.918% for a 72-dimensional data vector.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=105002683431&origin=inward,IEEE Internet of Things Journal,2025
Distributed Prescribe Performance Control Based on Adaptive Neural Network Strategy for Multi-AAVs Under Cyber-Attacks,"This article proposes a distributed finite-time prescribed performance (FTPP) control strategy with the adaptive neural network (NN) compound approximation method to achieve the cooperative control of multiple autonomous aerial vehicle systems (MAAVSs). The deceptive and injective cyber-attacks on sensors and actuators of MAAVS are considered. The attitude controller is designed based on the distributed backstepping law, by which the stepwise virtual control signals were designed to control the attitude states of the AAVs. The FTPP control scheme predefines the error boundary and the convergence time to constrain the cooperative tracking errors in a small neighborhood and the settling time. Then, the MAAVS are controlled to track the given reference trajectory rapidly. In addition, to obtain information on the actuator and sensor attacks, the NN method is synthesized with the adaptive law to approximate the attacks and alleviate the undesirable effects. The Lyapunov method was employed to analyze and prove the stability of distributed cooperative errors under AAV communication network described by graph theory. The conducted experiments verify the effectiveness and the superiority of the proposed control algorithm.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=10772425,IEEE Internet of Things Journal,2025
SECR: A Secure and Efficient Charging Reservation Scheme Based on Digital Twin in Vehicular Network,"Despite the rapid growth of electric vehicles (EVs), charging remains a time-consuming issue that requires effective management. An important solution uses digital twin (DT) technology, which acts as a virtual agent for EVs in the digital space. DT can analyze real-time vehicle data to develop optimal charging schedules and reserve charging providers in advance through the vehicular network, leading to more efficient charging processes. However, the vehicular network exposes the automated reservation process of the DT to security attacks. Additionally, there is a risk that the actual charging process may deviate from the scheduled requirements set by the DT, resulting in wasted charging resources. To address these issues, this article proposes a secure and efficient charging reservation scheme based on DT technology. To prevent malicious attacks, we first design a secure and privacy-preserving reservation authentication protocol using the extended Chebyshev chaotic maps, taking into account the computational resources of the EV. Furthermore, we develop a reputation mechanism to evaluate and incentivize the charging behavior of EVs. Formal verification and further discussions are conducted to show diverse security functionalities of the proposed scheme can be achieved. We evaluate that the proposed scheme outperforms existing schemes in terms of computation and communication overheads, while also assessing the impact of EV charging behavior on reputation and charging level.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=10783053,IEEE Internet of Things Journal,2025
RobIn: Robust-Invariant-Based Physical Attack Detector for Autonomous Aerial Vehicles,"Autonomous aerial vehicles (UAVs) are widespread in Internet of Things (IoT) systems applications. However, UAVs suffer cyberspace security threats, especially physical attacks that leverage physics signals to deceive sensors, disrupt missions, and potentially crash the UAVs. Such attack detection demands not only guaranteeing detection accuracy and timeliness but also robustness. Prior studies consider physical laws (Invariant) to detect inconsistency, but they sacrifice robustness requirements of uncertainties and lack theoretical guarantees of detection performance. To achieve the sensitivity-specificity tradeoff, this article proposes RobIn, a Robust Invariant-based physical attacks detector design incorporating scenario optimization. The key idea behind RobIn is robustifying the invariant model via scenario optimization theory to ensure modality untouched and trustworthy detection. With an offline robustification scheme and an onboard detection algorithm, RobIn can balance attack sensitivity and robustness to uncertainties. We theoretically provide the detection specificity lower bound guarantees under highlighting sensitivity in finite scenarios. We evaluate RobIn in both four virtual and three real UAVs, achieving 96.2% detection rates and 1.6% false alarm rates against 6 types of existing attacks, with only 3.82% runtime overhead (on average). Moreover, we illustrate the resilience of RobIn against the worst-case attack.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=105002562832&origin=inward,IEEE Internet of Things Journal,2025

DroneGuard: An Explainable and Efficient Machine Learning Framework for Intrusion Detection in Drone Networks,"Vulnerabilities in drone networks stem from the reliance on GPS and wireless communication technologies, combined with the lack of robust security mechanisms. This study proposes DroneGuard, a comprehensive cybersecurity framework leveraging supervised machine learning (ML) and explainable artificial intelligence (XAI) to detect intrusions and provide insights into the decision-making process of the security model. We explored various feature selection techniques to design a lightweight model suitable for the resource constraints of drones. Additionally, the synthetic minority oversampling technique (SMOTE) is employed to balance target class distribution and mitigate performance degradation, while randomized search cross-validation (RSCV) aids in selecting optimal hyperparameters for model training. Simulation experiments were conducted using a real-time GPS dataset for autonomous vehicles and a cybersecurity dataset containing variants of Denial of Service (DoS) attacks to evaluate the models’ performance. Comparison with four ML models using essential evaluation metrics validated the robust performance of the decision tree model, which detected spoofed GPS signals and DoS attacks with high accuracy, low-computational complexity, and minimal false alarm rates. Furthermore, the Shapley additive explanation (SHAP) provides intuitive visual explanations of important features contributing to the detection and classification of both GPS spoofing and DoS attacks. Therefore, DroneGuard offers effective and interpretable security solutions for enhanced drone application and adoption.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=105001592747&origin=inward,IEEE Internet of Things Journal,2025
GPS Attack Detection and Defense for Secure Localization of Automated Vehicles Based on Vehicle-to-Vehicle Technology,"Accurate and stable localization system plays a significant role in safe driving for connected automated vehicles (CAVs). However, the vulnerability from GPS spoofing attacks undermines the security of the localization system, posing great challenges for autonomous driving. In this article, a security-critical study for anomaly detection and defense against GPS attacks for CAVs using vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) technology is explored to improve the localization for driving safety under cyber-attack. First, a robust learning-based GPS stealthy attack model is designed to generate spoofing GPS signals, which can evade currently widely applied Kalman filter-based localization with  $\chi ^{2}$  anomaly detector and result in vehicle positioning errors, leading to more potential driving hazards than traditional models. Then a novel detection method for GPS anomaly with V2V communication based on density clustering algorithm is proposed to detect the wrong GPS data effectively. When the GPS attack is detected, the vehicle position is estimated accurately by an innovative cooperative localization (CL) approach with multi-information fusion from neighboring vehicles to defend against the GPS attack. The proposed framework is evaluated with three real-world driving data sets in closed-loop simulation. The results show that the developed attack detection method has the best performance compared to the state-of-the-art methods in terms of detection accuracy and detection timeliness. Furthermore, the CL for attack defense can provide accurate position estimation for the victim vehicle against GPS attack to realize safe autonomous driving, illustrating the effectiveness and robustness in various driving scenarios.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=10587201,IEEE Internet of Things Journal,2025

AoI Energy-Efficient Edge Caching in AAV-Assisted Vehicular Networks,"Mobile edge caching (MEC) has grown substantially with the rapid development in scale and complexity of data traffic. By exploiting the expansive coverage of autonomous aerial vehicles (AAVs), MEC enables services for massive vehicle users (VUs) simultaneously, which is promising for enhancing network transmission efficiency. Nonetheless, due to challenges arising from the timeliness and freshness of content services caused by AAVs’ limited endurance and airborne capacity, caching strategy considering the real-time of content in large-scale dynamic Internet of Vehicles (IoV) environments remains open. With the above consideration, in this article, the cache refreshing cycle and content placement are jointly optimized in the cache-enabled AAV-assisted vehicular integrated networks (CAVINs) to minimize the content Age of Information (AoI) and energy consumption of the macro AAV. Since the joint optimization problem is variational coupled with nonconvex binary constraints, it is decoupled and solved by a double-iteration method. Specifically, the optimal cache refreshing cycle is derived in semi-closed form with the Karush-Kuhn-Tucker (KKT) conditions. The locally optimal solution of the content placement is obtained through successive convex approximation (SCA). Simulation results corroborate the effectiveness and superiority of the proposed scheme.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85209715945&origin=inward,IEEE Internet of Things Journal,2025

Bayesian Network-Based Threat Assessment and TARAPSO Algorithm for UUV Path Planning in Complex Environments,"Path planning is crucial for unmanned underwater vehicles (UUVs) navigating in complex marine environments, which are often affected by multiple threat factors. Traditional path planning methods often fail to account for these factors, suffer from local optimal solutions, and lack adequate exploration and exploitation capabilities. To overcome these limitations, this paper proposes a target attraction rule-based adaptive particle swarm optimization (TARAPSO) algorithm, driven by threat assessment. Firstly, a 3D model of the complex marine environment is established, incorporating multiple threat factors. Secondly, a Bayesian network (BN)-based threat assessment model is developed to perform probabilistic inference on the states of potential threats encountered by the UUV. Based on the results of this assessment, a cost function incorporating the threat degree index is designed to evaluate the impact of various threat factors on the UUV’s path. Finally, the TARAPSO algorithm is introduced and applied to solve the multi-objective optimization problem of path planning, incorporating the threat assessment-driven cost function. Simulation results show that the TARAPSO algorithm, when combined with the BN-based threat assessment strategy, demonstrates superior efficiency in evaluating multiple threat factors, generates competitive paths with shorter lengths, and effectively ensures safe navigation of the UUV.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=105000608403&origin=inward,Journal of Intelligent and Robotic Systems: Theory and Applications,2025
Temporal Consistency as Pretext Task in Unsupervised Domain Adaptation for Semantic Segmentation,"Intelligent and autonomous robots (and vehicles) largely adopt computer vision systems to help in localization, navigation and obstacle avoidance tasks. By integrating different deep learning techniques, such as Object Detection and Image Semantic Segmentation, these systems achieve high accuracy in the domain they were trained on. Nonetheless, robustly operating in different domains still poses a major challenge to vision-based perception. In this sense, Unsupervised Domain Adaptation (UDA) has recently gained momentum due to its importance to real-world applications. Specifically, it leverages the prompt availability of unlabeled data to design auxiliary sources of supervision to guide the knowledge transfer between domains. The advantages of such an approach are two-fold: avoiding going through exhaustive labeling processes, and enhancing adaptation performance. In this scenario, exploring temporal correlations in unlabeled video data stands as an interesting alternative, which has not yet been explored to its full potential. In this work, we propose a Self-supervised learning framework that employs Temporal Consistency from unlabeled video sequences as a pretext task for improving UDA for Semantic Segmentation (UDASS). A simple yet effective strategy, it has shown promising results in a real-to-real adaptation setting. Our results and discussions are expected to benefit both new and experienced researchers on the subject.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=105000828494&origin=inward,Journal of Intelligent and Robotic Systems: Theory and Applications,2025
Improving Deep Q Network Based on Marketing Psychology for AUV Path Planning in Unknown Marine Environments,"Autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs) are commonly utilized in fields like marine environmental testing because of their adaptable and independent characteristics. However, the complexity and variability of the underwater environment present challenges for AUVs. AUVs need to safely and stably navigate through complex unknown underwater environments. The existing path planning technologies for AUVs in unknown marine environments face challenges, such as slow convergence speed and low success rate. In this article, a deep Q-learning (DQN) approach grounded in marketing psychology (MDQN) is suggested to tackle the challenges mentioned above. First, to reasonably allocate the exploration and exploitation abilities in DQN, a mathematical optimizer acceleration function is developed. Additionally, to improve the environmental adaptability of AUVs and speed up the convergence of deep networks, a reward mechanism that takes into account ocean currents and the shortest path principle is suggested. Finally, the reward feedback and experience stratification mechanism are designed based on marketing psychology principles, aiming to promote a virtuous cycle between the training process of deep networks and the learning process of the agent. Various simulation experiments comprehensively demonstrate that MDQN has excellent path planning capabilities in unknown marine environments, effectively addressing the slow convergence speed and low success rate issues of DQN.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85208274197&origin=inward,IEEE Internet of Things Journal,2025
Federated Training Generative Adversarial Networks for Heterogeneous Vehicle Scheduling in IoV,"In autonomous driving environments, generative adversarial networks (GANs) are often used to predict the future trajectories of objects in the scene, providing decision support for autonomous driving systems. However, integrating GAN models into the Internet of Vehicles (IoV) poses numerous challenges. First, GAN models necessitate user data and extensive computing resources, whereas diverse intelligent connected vehicle (ICV) possess limited bandwidth and computational capabilities, making it challenging to deploy models of the same scale as those in the cloud. Second, multifaceted aspects, including energy consumption, computation, communication, and vehicle training scheduling, have yet to be thoroughly examined, particularly in the context of IoV’s limited resources. To address the above issues, we propose a novel federated learning framework, heterogeneous-vehicle-scheduling-GAN (HVS-GAN), for training GANs in resource-constrained IoV environments. HVS-GAN balances GAN generation quality and training costs in IoV. It supports multiple ICVs training GAN models of different structures, breaking the strong assumption of uniform GAN model size constraints in previous works and enabling collaborative learning within IoV. Furthermore, to balance quality and training costs, we incorporate deep deterministic policy gradients learning to manage varying model size constraints, training delays, and training consumption across participating ICVs. Experimental results and analysis confirm the superiority of our proposed HVS-GAN solution, which achieves better outcomes in IoV scenarios with stringent model size constraints compared to state-of-the-art algorithms.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85211210760&origin=inward,IEEE Internet of Things Journal,2025
Perception-Aware-Based UAV Trajectory Planner via Generative Adversarial Self-Imitation Learning From Demonstrations,"The use of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) for Internet of Things applications, like intelligent monitoring and search, is increasingly becoming a popular research focus globally. While various optimization algorithms exist to plan UAV flight paths, they frequently compromise the quality of the planning path to decrease planning time. In view of the above problems, a perception-aware-based UAV trajectory planner via generative adversarial self-imitation learning from demonstration is proposed. First, a progressively growing discriminator is devised to prevent the policy network from being overpowered in early training stages, avoiding potential training failures. Second, the issue of homogenized strategic patterns among optimized expert trajectories is solved by incorporating successful trajectories from the policy network into the expert buffer, which thereby enhances the network’s generalization capabilities. Third, to address the challenges of skewed distribution and considerable performance variation among the strategies learned by the policy network during training, a class-level instance-balancing expert buffer is introduced. Finally, the yaw angle of the UAV in real time during flight is obtained by using the analytical solution of the position trajectory and yaw angle and the position trajectory output from the policy network. Experiments confirm our proposed method achieves comparable flight costs and success rates to those of the reference expert method, while the planning time is reduced. The proposed method is also shown to be well adapted to dynamic environments and obstacle trajectories, which are not involved in training. Additionally, the ablation studies highlight the individual contributions of each component within the proposed method.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=10710142,IEEE Internet of Things Journal,2025

However, frequently changed geometrical configurations and potential network congestion severely threaten system performance. Regarding this, this article proposes an anti-competition communication mechanism-based affine formation maneuver control (AFMC) scheme for the Internet of USVs. First, an auxiliary system is introduced to construct two-layer-based formation maneuver structure, i.e., localization layer and tracking layer. In the localization layer, an intermittent interleaved period event-triggered mechanism (IIPETM) is proposed such that each individual could enjoy interleaved communication periods. Then, by establishing a backstepping-based controller in the tracking layer, formation members will sail along a trajectory generated by the localization layer, thus forming the desired geometrical configuration. The proposed method can significantly reduce network throughput and improve communication efficiency even under intermittent network connectivity. Finally, theoretical analysis and simulations are performed to validate the feasibility of the proposed method.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=10720705,IEEE Internet of Things Journal,2025
"Laser-Based LiDAR Spoofing: Effects Validation, Capability Quantification, and Countermeasures","Autonomous vehicles (AVs) and robots increasingly exploit light detection and ranging (LiDAR)-based 3-D object detection systems to detect obstacles in the environment. Correct detection and classification are important to ensure safe driving. Although previous work has demonstrated the feasibility of manipulating point clouds to spoof 3-D object detectors, most of these attempts are performed digitally. In this article, we investigate the possibility of physically fooling LiDAR-based 3-D object detection by injecting adversarial point clouds using lasers. First, we develop a laser transceiver that can inject up to 4200 points, and can measure the scanning cycle of victim LiDARs to schedule the spoofing laser signals. By designing a control signal method that converts the coordinates of point clouds to control signals and an adversarial point cloud optimization method with physical constraints of LiDARs and attack capabilities, we manage to inject spoofing point cloud with desired point cloud shapes into the victim LiDAR physically. We can launch four types of attacks, i.e., naive hiding, record-based creating, optimization-based hiding, and optimization-based creating. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our attacks against two commercial LiDAR and three detectors. We further analyze the impact of our attacks on four fusion-based detectors. This article concludes with experiments on defense methods and discussion on potential defense strategies at both the sensor and AV system levels.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85210998920&origin=inward,IEEE Internet of Things Journal,2025

Bi-LSTM-Based Resilient Data-Driven Integral Sliding Mode Control for UMVs Under Hybrid Attacks,"In this paper, based on bidirectional long short-term memory (Bi-LSTM) neural network, a resilient partial form dynamic linearization data-driven integral sliding mode control (PFDL-DDISMC) method is designed to realize the trajectory tracking for unmanned marine vehicles (UMVs) under deny-of-service (DoS) attacks and false data injection (FDI) attacks in the measurement channel. First, the generalization error bound of the Bi-LSTM, which is related to the number of samples and the bounds of the weight matrices, is proved through Rademacher complexity analysis. A Bi-LSTM-based intelligent predictor is designed to predict the position and velocity of UMVs and to estimate external disturbances. Based on this, a threshold-based attack detection and compensation scheme is proposed to determine whether the UMVs are suffering from attacks and to compensate for the compromised transmission signals. Furthermore, considering the bounds of the generalization errors of predictions, a resilient secure controller is designed using the compensation data from the proposed compensation mechanism and a data-driven discrete-time integral sliding mode control method. Compared with the data-driven control scheme, the UMVs with proposed PFDL-DDISMC can exhibit more effective trajectory tracking performance under disturbances and hybrid attacks. Theoretical analysis verifies that the proposed PFDL-DDISMC method ensures the stability of the tracking error system for UMVs subjected to hybrid attacks and external disturbances. Finally, three simulation examples are provided to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed resilient PFDL-DDISMC scheme and the convergence of the tracking error.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85218739774&origin=inward,IEEE Transactions on Intelligent Transportation Systems,2025
Resilient Consensus Control for Multiple UAVs With Input Saturation Under DoS Attacks,"In this article, a resilient consensus control method is proposed for nonlinear multiple unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) with input saturation and Denial of Service (DoS) attacks. First, an input saturation constraint based on the UAV dynamic model is investigated in this article, and an adaptive compensating term is developed to handle the input saturation. The DoS attacks considered in this article can interrupt all the communication transmissions of the attacked UAV from neighbors so that the victim is not able to receive any information from neighboring UAVs during DoS attacks. To deal with such a difficult problem, a fixed-time security constraint estimator (FTSCE) is proposed to ensure the stability and security of UAVs during the DoS attacks. Moreover, the unknown state is estimated to reduce the amount of the transferred information. Based on the proposed FTSCE, the relative position and velocity of UAV states are used to design the resilient consensus controller against the DoS attacks. By using the proposed controller, the system stability can be guaranteed according to the Lyapunov stability analysis. Finally, the numerical simulation is conducted to verify the effectiveness of the proposed resilient consensus control method.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=86000433029&origin=inward,IEEE Transactions on Cybernetics,2025
Accurate and Capable GNSS-Inertial-Visual Vehicle Navigation via Tightly Coupled Multiple Homogeneous Sensors,"Continuous and reliable estimation of navigation states is of paramount importance in ensuring the safe operation of intelligent vehicles. The conventional global navigation satellite system (GNSS)-Inertial-Visual navigation systems have demonstrated the capability to achieve locally accurate and globally drift-free pose estimation. However, challenges such as frequent satellite signal interference, limited visual features, and sudden sensor failures can severely degrade performance or even lead to complete system collapse when utilizing minimal sensor configurations. For this reason, we propose a novel and globally drift-free tightly coupled (TC) system that can integrate any number of GNSS, inertial measurement units (IMUs), and cameras to enable accurate and robust vehicle navigation. Specifically, a stacked state estimator centered on the IMU is designed to fuse information from all sensors at the raw measurement level. The pseudorange and carrier phase measurements from all GNSS terminals are directly correlated with the core IMU, ensuring accurate and fast positioning of the system in a global frame. The feature measurements from multiple independent cameras are also used to update the states by exploiting inter-epoch geometric constraints. In addition, the multiple homogeneous IMUs can not only further improve the state estimation of the system by imposing rigid constraints on the core IMU, but also switch over in time for smooth state estimation when the core IMU are faulty. We comprehensively evaluate the state estimation accuracy and robustness of the proposed approach through a series of in-vehicle experiments and simulation experiments in real urban scenarios. The results indicate that the proposed system can achieve 93.2% availability with a horizontal position error less than 0.5 m and 97.8% availability with a heading error less than 0.2 deg in typical urban environments, significantly outperforming both conventional and state-of-the-art approaches. Note to Practitioners—This study focuses on the tight integration of multiple homogeneous and heterogeneous sensors with the goal of addressing frequent interference and degradation challenges in wide-area vehicle navigation applications. We propose a general-purpose GNSS-Inertial-Visual tight coupled framework capable of integrating any number of GNSS, IMUs, and cameras at the raw measurement level. It maximizes the use of as much sensor information as possible to achieve accurate and robust state estimation and is resilient to anomalous measurements and sensor unavailability. This solution holds practical and effective for autonomous vehicles that are now commonly equipped with multiple sensors.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=10587194,IEEE Transactions on Automation Science and Engineering,2025
Systematic Literature Review: Anomaly Detection in Connected and Autonomous Vehicles,"This systematic literature review provides a structured and detailed overview of research on anomaly detection for connected and autonomous vehicles, focusing on the Artificial Intelligence methods employed, training approaches, and testing and evaluation techniques. The initial database search identified 2,160 articles, of which 203 were included in this review after rigorous screening and assessment. This study revealed that the most commonly used anomaly detection techniques employed are deep learning networks such as LSTM, CNN, and autoencoders, alongside one-class SVM. Most detection models were trained using real-world operational vehicle data, although anomalies, such as attacks and faults, were often injected artificially into the datasets. The models were evaluated primarily using five key evaluation metrics: recall, accuracy, precision, F1-score, and false positive rate. The most frequently used set of evaluation metrics for detection models were accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score. The review makes several recommendations to improve future work related to anomaly detection models. It recommends providing comprehensive assessment of the anomaly detection models and emphasise the importance to share models publicly to facilitate collaboration within the research community and enable further validation. Recommendations also include the need for benchmarking datasets with predefined anomalies or cyberattacks (with comprehensive threat modelling) to test and improve the effectiveness of the proposed anomaly detection models. Future research should focus on the deployment of anomaly based detection in vehicles to evaluate their performance in real-world driving conditions, and explore systems using communication protocols beyond CAN, such as Ethernet and FlexRay.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=10771587,IEEE Transactions on Intelligent Transportation Systems,2025
A Semantic-Consistent Few-Shot Modulation Recognition Framework for IoT Applications,"The rapid growth of the Internet of Things (IoT) has led to the widespread adoption of the IoT networks in numerous digital applications. To counter physical threats in these systems, automatic modulation classification (AMC) has emerged as an effective approach for identifying the modulation format of signals in noisy environments. However, identifying those threats can be particularly challenging due to the scarcity of labeled data, which is a common issue in various IoT applications, such as anomaly detection for unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) and intrusion detection in the IoT networks. Few-shot learning (FSL) offers a promising solution by enabling models to grasp the concepts of new classes using only a limited number of labeled samples. However, prevalent FSL techniques are primarily tailored for tasks in the computer vision domain and are not suitable for the wireless signal domain. Instead of designing a new FSL model, this work suggests a novel approach that enhances wireless signals to be more efficiently processed by the existing state-of-the-art (SOTA) FSL models. We present the semantic-consistent signal pretransformation (ScSP), a parameterized transformation architecture that ensures signals with identical semantics exhibit similar representations. ScSP is designed to integrate seamlessly with various SOTA FSL models for signal modulation recognition and supports commonly used deep learning backbones. Our evaluation indicates that ScSP boosts the performance of numerous SOTA FSL models, while preserving flexibility.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85209079319&origin=inward,IEEE Transactions on Neural Networks and Learning Systems,2025
An Improvised Certificate-Based Proxy Signature Using Hyperelliptic Curve Cryptography for Secure UAV Communications,"Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) have enabled numerous inventive solutions to multiple problems, considerably facilitating our daily lives; however, UAVs frequently rely on an open wireless channel for communication, making them susceptible to cyber-physical threats. Also, UAVs cannot execute complicated cryptographic algorithms due to their limited onboard computing capabilities. Balancing high-security levels and minimum computation costs is imperative when developing a security solution for UAVs. Consequently, several proxy signature schemes have been proposed in the literature to fulfill these requirements. Nevertheless, many of these solutions face the issue of high computation costs, and some exhibit security vulnerabilities that could not be more feasible options for UAV communication. Considering these constraints in mind, in this article, we introduce an improvised certificate-based proxy signature scheme (ICPS), which leverages the concept of hyperelliptic curve cryptography (HECC) to meet the security and efficiency requirements of UAV networks. The proposed ICPS scheme offers a range of notable features, including its ability to address key escrow and secret key distribution issues. The proposed ICPS scheme’s security hardness has been evaluated using the widely known security tool, the random oracle model (ROM), proving its resilience against known and unknown cybersecurity threats. Finally, this study conducts a performance comparison of the proposed scheme against existing schemes, emphasizing its outstanding cost-efficiency. Notably, the computation cost is measured at 5.3536 ms and the communication cost at 1120 bits, substantially lower than relevant existing schemes.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=10841475,IEEE Transactions on Intelligent Transportation Systems,2025
Traffic Control via Fleets of Connected and Automated Vehicles,"In this paper, we propose three control strategies, based on different levels of cooperation (centralized, decentralized and quasi-decentralized), to improve density dependent traffic performance indexes, such as fuel consumption, by acting on a small number of Connected and Automated Vehicles (CAVs) operating as moving bottlenecks on the surrounding flow. We rely on a multi-scale approach to model mixed traffic of CAVs in the bulk flow. In particular, CAVs are individually tracked and they are allowed to overtake (if on distinct lanes) or queuing (if on the same lane). Controlling CAVs desired speeds allows to act on the system to minimize the selected cost function. For the proposed control strategies, we apply both global optimization and a Model Predictive Control approach. In particular, we perform numerical tests to investigate how the CAVs number and positions impact the result, showing that few, optimally chosen vehicles are sufficient to significantly improve the selected performance indexes, even using a decentralized control policy. Simulation results support the attractive perspective of exploiting a very small number of vehicles as endogenous control actuators to regulate traffic flow on road networks, providing a flexible alternative to traditional control methods.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=10786916,IEEE Transactions on Intelligent Transportation Systems,2025
Barrier-Enhanced Parallel Homotopic Trajectory Optimization for Safety-Critical Autonomous Driving,"Enforcing safety while preventing overly conservative behaviors is essential for autonomous vehicles to achieve high task performance. In this paper, we propose a barrier-enhanced parallel homotopic trajectory optimization (BPHTO) approach with the over-relaxed alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM) for real-time integrated decision-making and planning. To facilitate safety interactions between the ego vehicle (EV) and surrounding vehicles, a spatiotemporal safety module exhibiting bi-convexity is developed on the basis of barrier function. Varying barrier coefficients are adopted for different time steps in a planning horizon to account for the motion uncertainties of surrounding HVs and mitigate conservative behaviors. Additionally, we exploit the discrete characteristics of driving maneuvers to initialize nominal behavior-oriented free-end homotopic trajectories based on reachability analysis, and each trajectory is locally constrained to a specific driving maneuver while sharing the same task objectives. By leveraging the bi-convexity of the safety module and the kinematics of the EV, we formulate the BPHTO as a bi-convex optimization problem. Then constraint transcription and the over-relaxed ADMM are employed to streamline the optimization process, such that multiple trajectories are generated in real time with feasibility guarantees. Through a series of experiments, the proposed development demonstrates improved task accuracy, stability, and consistency in various traffic scenarios using synthetic and real-world traffic datasets.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=10779443,IEEE Transactions on Intelligent Transportation Systems,2025
Asymptotic Leader-Following Consensus of Heterogeneous Multi-Agent Systems With Unknown and Time-Varying Control Gains,"This paper investigates the consensus tracking control problem for a class of nonlinear multi-input multi-output (MIMO) heterogeneous multi-agent systems (HMASs), where the dimension of the dynamics of each agent is allowed to be different from each other. In addition, the control gain matrices (CGMs) with unknown time-varying coefficients and actuator faults with unpredictable jumps are also involved in the considered MIMO HMASs, all of which would cause damage for the system performance. First, a novel distributed auxiliary filter by feat of time-varying technology is introduced, which allows the zero-error estimation for the desired trajectory to be achieved and the asymptotic consensus tracking result to be further realized. Then, a cooperative adaptive control solution is proposed to ensure the asymptotical consensus tracking control result, in spite of the inherent unknown time-varying coefficients, unpredictable jumps caused by the unknown actuator faults, unknown disturbances and uncertain system parameters, distinguishing itself from those existing cooperative control works for HMASs where only ultimately uniformly bounded (UUB) result is derived. This is achieved mainly by the introduction of a series of Nussbaum functions and the employment of the adaptive estimation techniques. The effectiveness of the proposed control algorithm is confirmed by the simulation conducted on a group of HMASs involving unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) and autonomous surface vessels (ASVs). Note to Practitioners—In large-scale complex communication networks, uncertain HMASs with different structures and functions are capable of exchanging information and collaborating with each other to accomplish more complex and diverse tasks. Simultaneously, the probability of actuator faults within the HMASs increases dramatically, and the fault of a single agent may evolve into the failure of the whole system. Thus, the safety and reliability of HMASs are extremely important. Additionally, the control direction (the symbol of control gain) caused by both CGMs with coupling property of MIMO systems and actuator faults with unpredictable jumps, may not be guaranteed to be known in practical application, such as ship autopilot systems or uncalibrated visual servoing. This will have a considerable influence on the system’s control performance. On account of the threat of nonlinear uncertainties, and unknown control direction yield CGMs and actuator faults to HMASs, an adaptive fault-tolerant control solution based on an effective distributed time-varying auxiliary filter, is developed for MIMO HMASs to guarantee the asymptotical consensus tracking control result. Further, the proposed control scheme has been illustrated to be feasible through simulation experiment conducted on a group of HMASs consisting of UAVs and ASVs.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85190728775&origin=inward,IEEE Transactions on Automation Science and Engineering,2025
Algorithms for Cameras View-Frame Placement Problems in the Presence of an Adversary and Distributional Ambiguity,"In this paper, we introduce cameras view-frame placement problem (denoted by CFP) in the presence of an adversary whose objective is to minimize the maximum coverage by  $p$  cameras in response to input provided by  $n$  autonomous agents in a remote location. We allow uncertainty in the success of attacks, incomplete information of the probability distribution associated with the uncertain data, and varying levels of risk-appetite of the adversary. We present an exact cutting planes based algorithm to solve this problem and provide conditions under which it is finitely convergent. Since this approach solves deterministic CFP in each iteration, we also present improved exact method for CFP with  $p=1$ , approximation algorithm and heuristics for Multi-CFP with  $p\geq 2$ , and Multi-CFP with fixed tilt of the cameras. To evaluate the effectiveness and performance of the proposed approaches, we conduct computational experiments using randomly generated instances and simulation experiments where these approaches are utilized to find a hidden object in a remote location. Note to Practitioners—Telerobotic cameras have been widely used for a variety of applications in environment where it is tedious for humans to collect information such as surveillance, natural environment observation, search and rescue, satellite imaging, and many more. Therefore, computationally efficient approaches proposed in this paper for placement of view-frame of camera(s), by adjusting their pan, tilt, and zoom, will improve the effective utilization of a telerobotic cameras system. Additionally, before operating such systems in a military environment, a decision maker needs to analyze vulnerable cameras in the system whose disruption can significantly impact the information acquisition process. The algorithms presented for adversarial camera view-frame placement problem can identify the set of cameras (or vehicles carrying them) that are susceptible to attacks by a reasonable (risk-averse) attacker. Likewise, the proposed algebraic modeling framework and solution approaches are also applicable for planning interdiction actions to minimize the information acquisition by an evader/enemy. These results can be leveraged by autonomy solutions developed by the Army for both logistics (Autonomous Ground Resupply program) and combat missions (Combat Vehicle Robotics program).",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=10400994,IEEE Transactions on Automation Science and Engineering,2025
Defending UAV Networks Against Covert Attacks Using Auxiliary Signal Injections,"Unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) networks, which carry vital information, are prone to various attacks, and hence security issues are a major concern. In this paper, we design and implement a novel covert attack detection and secure control scheme, which operates between the UAV (the physical layer) and ground control station (GCS) (the cyber layer). Covert attacks can alter the UAV states, and yet cause the signals seen by the controller to appear unchanged, resulting in these attacks being more difficult to detect, and hence more dangerous compared to other types of attacks. To unmask the covert attacks, we construct and inject auxiliary signals to both the controller output and the UAV input. The auxiliary signals cause information of the attack to appear in the controller input, which is then fed to a detection observer to detect the attack. Next, we propose an integrated estimation and secure control scheme, comprising a reconstruction observer (which is a sliding mode observer (SMO)) that estimates the system states and attack signal, and an output-feedback controller that utilizes the estimated signals. We perform a series of transformations to the system, such that the design parameters of both reconstruction observer and secure controller are placed in a framework that is solvable using Linear Matrix Inequalities (LMIs). We also prove that the proposed integrated secure controller causes the output tracking errors to satisfy an  ${{\mathcal {H}}}_{\infty }$  performance index. We also rigorously analyze the system performance, and present the necessary conditions for the scheme to be feasible. Finally, simulations are conducted to verify the effectiveness of the proposed scheme. Note to Practitioners—This paper presents a method to detect covert attacks in the UAV network, and to mitigate against those attacks. Covert attacks are more malicious since they are difficult to detect. The proposed method in this paper consists of auxiliary signal injection and a detection observer that will expose and detect the attacks, and a reconstruction observer and secure controller that will estimate the attacks and mitigate its effect on the plant. The controller and observers are designed using Linear Matrix Inequalities to minimize the  ${{\mathcal {H}}}_{\infty }$  gain from the attack on the plant performance. In addition, this paper also investigates the conditions that the plant must satisfy such that the proposed scheme is feasible, and presents them in an easily verifiable form. Finally, the paper also analyses the performance of the proposed scheme in all scenarios - namely before the attack occurs, when the attack occurs but is not yet detected, and after the attack is detected.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85209878670&origin=inward,IEEE Transactions on Automation Science and Engineering,2025
Resilient Tracking Control of Cyber-Physical Systems Against False Data Injection Attacks and Obstacle Avoidance,"In this paper, the reliable tracking control and collision avoidance problems for cyber-physical systems (CPSs) with false data injection (FDI) attacks are investigated. FDI attacks can significantly compromise the safety and performance of CPSs by corrupting control and navigation data. Safety is an important aspect of CPSs. Unmanned ground vehicles and aerial vehicles are important applications of CPSs. The dual challenge of maintaining system safety and stability under deliberate cyberattacks, while ensuring reliable obstacle avoidance in dynamic environments, remains unresolved in many current methodologies. These challenges are amplified in CPSs owing to their reliance on real-time data and their susceptibility to adversarial manipulation. The main objective of this study is to develop a resilient tracking control strategy that can effectively mitigate the impact of FDI attacks and achieve obstacle avoidance. We propose a novel framework based on the exponential control barrier function (ECBF) and a novel observer-based auxiliary signal approach that can ensure the resilience of CPSs against FDI attacks and obstacle avoidance. The effectiveness of our methods is shown through extensive simulations and physical experiments, which depict improved tracking accuracy and system stability in the presence of FDI attacks as compared with those of traditional control methods.Note to Practitioners—This research tackles the problem of maintaining dependable tracking control and avoiding collisions in CPSs vulnerable to FDI attacks, with applications in fields such as smart transportation and smart city. To mitigate the impact of FDI attacks, we propose a resilient control strategy that uses exponential ECBF and an observer-based auxiliary signal approach. This framework mitigates the impact of corrupted data, maintains system stability, and avoids collisions, even in the presence of cyberattacks. Practitioners in CPS design and deployment can benefit from this approach by integrating it into existing systems to improve safety and security. The proposed method is validated through both simulations and physical experiments, demonstrating its practicality for real-world applications.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=10906605,IEEE Transactions on Automation Science and Engineering,2025
An Intelligent Multi-Layer Control Architecture for Logistics Operations of Autonomous Vehicles in Manufacturing Systems,"In this paper, autonomous vehicles are considered for addressing logistic operations in manufacturing systems. The starting idea consists in organizing a given group of autonomous robots/vehicles in a finite set of platoons in charge to accomplish prescribed job(s) within the manufacturing system. Three aspects are then needed to be formally outlined: task scheduling, routing decisions and command inputs computations. Here, a new distributed multi-layer architecture has been conceived by using three methodologies: timed colored Petri nets, deep reinforcement learning and model predictive control. Roughly speaking, timed colored Petri nets are exploited to formally model the manufacturing system so that an optimal scheduling task complying with the required jobs and the available vehicles is derived; then, run-time routing decisions are obtained by using a distributed reinforcement learning algorithm which exploits the available information provided by the vehicle sensor module; finally, the distributed model predictive control algorithm is built by resorting to a set-theoretic approach where most of the computations are off-line performed. A flexible manufacturing system consisting of four machines and a Load/Unload station is used for simulation purposes. Specifically, five jobs are hypothesized and some scenarios with an increasing number of available vehicles are simulated. In order to evaluate the benefits of the proposed approach, a time criterion based on the completion of all the jobs is considered with the aim to put in light that increasing the number of vehicles improves the control performance until congestion phenomena become unavoidable. Note to Practitioners—This paper proposes an innovative methodology for addressing the logistic operations within flexible manufacturing systems (FMSs) by using a team of autonomous ground vehicles. Unlike existing approaches, the core of this framework consists in combining along a hierarchical structure the capabilities of timed colored Petri nets and the deep reinforcement learning techniques to determine a near-optimal scheduling and run-time routing decisions that are provided to the distributed model predictive units in charge to accomplish the prescribed task. This multi-layer architecture has two main merits: a single platoon, completely disconnected from the others, is devoted to perform its own job; computational burdens are affordable during the on-line operations because most of the computations are moved in the off-line phase.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=105001203307&origin=inward,IEEE Transactions on Automation Science and Engineering,2025

Energy Efficient Defense Against Cooperative Hostile Detection and Eavesdropping Attacks for AAV-Aided Short-Packet Transmissions,"Autonomous aerial vehicle (AAV)-aided short-packet transmissions have emerged as a promising paradigm for supporting mission-critical applications in future mobile communication networks. However, the security issues raised by the open nature of the wireless transmission deserve attention, especially when confronted with cooperative wardens and eavesdroppers. To this end, we consider a new framework for an energy-efficient design of AAV-aided short-packet transmission systems against cooperative hostile detection and eavesdropping attacks. Specifically, the false rate of the cooperative hostile detection is first derived by utilizing the likelihood ratio test and the bivariate Gaussian distribution property. Then, we formulate a problem to maximize the minimum covert secrecy energy efficiency (MCSEE) by jointly optimizing the user association, AAV power control, and AAV three-dimensional (3D) trajectory design. We propose a penalty-based dual-loop iterative optimization algorithm to tackle this complex problem suboptimally with the aid of auxiliary penalty variables, where the communication resource scheduling, the AAV trajectory planning, and the auxiliary penalty variables are optimized in the inner loop. In particular, the intractable joint AAV power control and 3D trajectory design sub-problem is suboptimally addressed by introducing slack variables and employing successive convex approximation (SCA) techniques. The penalty factor is updated in the outer loop. Finally, numerical results are provided to verify the effectiveness and superiority of our proposed solution to several benchmarks.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85207436478&origin=inward,IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology,2025
An Intelligent Quantum Cyber-Security Framework for Healthcare Data Management,"Digital healthcare is essential to facilitate consumers to access and disseminate their medical data easily for enhanced medical care services. However, the significant concern with digitalization across healthcare systems necessitates for a prompt, productive, and secure storage facility along with a vigorous communication strategy, to stimulate sensitive digital healthcare data sharing and proactive estimation of malicious entities. In this context, this paper introduces a comprehensive quantum-based framework to overwhelm the potential security and privacy issues for secure healthcare data management. It equips quantum encryption for the secured storage and dispersal of healthcare data over the shared cloud platform by employing quantum encryption. Also, the framework furnishes a quantum feed-forward neural network unit to examine the intention behind the data request before granting access, for proactive estimation of potential data breach. In this way, the proposed framework delivers overall healthcare data management by coupling the advanced and more competent quantum approach with machine learning to safeguard the data storage, access, and prediction of malicious entities in an automated manner. Thus, the proposed IQ-HDM leads to more cooperative and effective healthcare delivery and empowers individuals with adequate custody of their health data. The experimental evaluation and comparison of the proposed IQ-HDM framework with state-of-the-art methods outline a considerable improvement up to 67.6%, in tackling cyber threats related to healthcare data security. Note to Practitioners—This paper aims to address the issue of digital healthcare data access, which requires both ease and security. Existing research either focuses solely on safe access or on high security, which often comes with high computational challenges.

Event-Based Fixed-Time Secure Control for Multiagent Systems Under Distributed DoS Attacks,"This article focuses on the leader–following consensus in fixed time for multiagent systems under denial-of-service (DoS) attacks.

Anomaly Detection and Secure Position Estimation Against GPS Spoofing Attack: A Security-Critical Study of Localization in Autonomous Driving,"For advanced autonomous driving (AD) systems, localization is highly critical for safety. Recent results show that GPS is vulnerable to spoofing attacks, and it is not clear whether the current localization is secure enough against advanced GPS spoofing attacks. In this paper, a systematic study regarding the security of the localization under GPS spoofing is explored for safe and reliable AD. First, a novel and robust GPS adversarial attack design method is proposed to defeat the principle of the multi-sensor fusion algorithm and lead to wrong position. It can cheat the widely used Chi-squared detector in Kalman filter and cause the vehicle to drive off the road, posing greater challenge on safe driving. Second, a real-time Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) attack detector is developed to detect the serious attack effectively. When the attack is detected, a multi-information fusion method based on the lateral direction localization from camera and map using Unscented Kalman filter is proposed to defend against the GPS attack and provide accurate position estimation for automated vehicles to drive on roads safely. The proposed method is validated in various scenarios in Carla simulator and a real-word driving dataset to demonstrate its effectiveness in timely GPS attack detection and secure position estimation. The results show that the LSTM-based detection method has best performance compared to the state-of-the-art detection approaches. The position estimation for attack defense is effective and robust in different driving scenarios, ensuring safe and reliable AD in closed-loop form.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=10669078,IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology,2025
High-Speed Interception Multicopter Control by Image-Based Visual Servoing,"In recent years, reports of illegal drones threatening public safety have increased. For the invasion of fully autonomous drones, traditional methods, such as radio frequency interference and GPS shielding, may fail. This article proposes a scheme that uses an autonomous multicopter with a strapdown camera to intercept a maneuvering intruder unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV). The interceptor multicopter can autonomously detect and intercept intruders moving at high speed in the air. The strapdown camera avoids the complex mechanical structure of the electro-optical pod, making the interceptor multicopter compact. However, the coupling of the camera and multicopter motion makes interception tasks difficult. To solve this problem, an image-based visual servoing (IBVS) controller is proposed to make the interception fast and accurate. Then, in response to the time delay of sensor imaging and image processing relative to attitude changes in high-speed scenarios, a delayed Kalman filter (DKF) observer is generalized to predict the current image position and increase the update frequency. Finally, hardware-in-the-loop (HITL) simulations and outdoor flight experiments verify that this method has a high interception accuracy and success rate. In the flight experiments, a high-speed interception is achieved with a terminal speed of 20m/s.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=10676325,IEEE Transactions on Control Systems Technology,2025
Human-Like Interactive Lane-Change Modeling Based on Reward-Guided Diffusive Predictor and Planner,"Lane changing presents a dynamic scenario characterized by intricate interactions among vehicles. Within mixed-autonomy traffic environment, modeling a human-like lane-change trajectory enables human drivers to better understand and predict autonomous vehicles’ behaviors, thereby enhancing road safety and travel efficiency. In this study, we achieve human-like interactive lane-change modeling based on a novel framework named Diff-LC. The human-like modeling of LCV behaviors relies on an advanced diffusive planner, and the implemented trajectory is selected based on the recovered LCV reward function learned through Multi-Agent Adversarial Inverse Reinforcement Learning (MA-AIRL). To account for interactions between FVs and LCVs, we further employ a diffusive predictor to forecast future behaviors of FVs conditioned on both historical and planned trajectories. Additionally, we leverage the recovered reward function of FVs to enable controllable prediction of trajectories. In the experimental part, we begin by analyzing the significance of features in the recovered reward functions and then proceed to compare the distinctions between the LCV and the FV. To validate the effectiveness of the proposed framework, we compare the diffusive predictor and planner with several state-of-the-art methods. The results demonstrate that motions planned by Diff-LC closely reach the intended positions with small displacement errors and exhibit highly similar speed and jerk distributions to those of human drivers. We also conduct a dynamic simulation to evaluate Diff-LC’s performance across different traffic conditions. Finally, we explore customized generation using the Diffusion Posterior Sampling method. The codes can be found at https://github.com/zeonchen/Diff-LC/.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=105001060535&origin=inward,IEEE Transactions on Intelligent Transportation Systems,2025
AAV Swarm Cooperative Search Based on Scalable Multiagent Deep Reinforcement Learning With Digital Twin-Enabled Sim-to-Real Transfer,"Cooperative target search (CTS) technology is highly desirable in various multi-autonomous aerial vehicle (AAV) applications. However, searching for unknown targets in a dynamic threatening environment is a challenging problem, especially for AAVs with limited sensing range and communication capabilities. Besides, traditional searching methods lack scalability and efficient collaboration among the AAV swarm in dynamic environments. In this work, a digital twin (DT)-enabled distributed CTS approach was presented for AAV swarms and achieving sim-to-real transfer. Specifically, a new scalable multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) based algorithm called SAMARL is adopted to improve effectiveness and adaptability, combining a multi-head attention mechanism. In SAMARL, a scalable observation space with graph representation and an environmental cognition map is designed to thoroughly consider the target search rate, area coverage, and safety assurance. Then, a DT-driven training framework is proposed to facilitate the continuous evolution of MARL models and address the tradeoff between training speed and environment fidelity. Furthermore, we innovatively develop a distributed AAV swarm digital twin cooperative target search validation system, including real flight control, communication simulation tools, and a 3D physics engine. Extensive simulations validate its superiority compared to state-of-the-art strategies. More importantly, we also conduct real-world flight experiments on different scale mission areas and AAV swarms, further demonstrating the generalization and scalability of trained models.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=10843321,IEEE Transactions on Mobile Computing,2025
Secure State Estimation for Cyber-Physical Systems Against Active Eavesdropping Attacks: A Stochastic Encryption-Based Method,"This article is concerned with the problem of remote state estimation for cyber-physical systems (CPSs) in the presence of an active eavesdropper. To prevent information leakage, a novel stochastic encryption scheme is proposed to protect the data transmitted via packet loss channel. The scheme can guarantee the user’s privacy and force the estimation error of the eavesdropper to diverge by using a predefined scheduling sequence to transmit raw data or an encrypted version randomly. In this case, two types of data are considered: raw measurements and local estimates. Aiming at these two transmission scenarios, the expected estimation error recursions with respect to encryption mechanisms, channel parameters, and the system dynamics are derived in the minimum mean error estimation sense. Further, we show the conditions that require the expected estimation error covariance of the user to be bounded, while the active eavesdropper’s expected estimation error grows unbounded by mathematical induction and matrix theory methods. Finally, an application example is illustrated to verify the performance of the encryption scheme. Note to Practitioners—This paper addresses the secure state estimation for a class of CPSs in the presence of eavesdropping attacks, which plays a vital role in many critical infrastructures, such as unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) and smart grids. The system’s confidential information is transmitted over the wireless channel to a remote estimator that is likely to be overheard by a malicious eavesdropper. Most existing privacy protection methods not only constrain the capabilities of eavesdroppers, such as packet reception rate, but also have limited ability to disrupt the estimated performance of eavesdroppers. Besides, few studies have been conducted on the impact of active eavesdroppers who may have a higher packet reception rate. To overcome these difficulties, based on control-theoretic approaches, we propose two alternative encryption schemes for two different transmission scenarios. Note that our scheme can guarantee that the user’s estimation error is bounded, while the estimation error of the eavesdropper goes to unbounded. Accordingly, the privacy and estimation performance of the system can be ensured by our encryption scheme, and the encryption schemes can be conveniently applied to practical systems.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=10684984,IEEE Transactions on Automation Science and Engineering,2025
AAV 3-D Path Planning Based on MOEA/D With Adaptive Areal Weight Adjustment,"Autonomous aerial vehicles (AAVs) are desirable platforms for time-efficient and cost-effective task execution. 3-D path planning problems for AAVs can be treated as constrained multiobjective optimization problems. However, due to the complexity of real-world problems, the Pareto front frequently exhibits irregularity. For path planning problems characterized by sharp peaks and low tails on the Pareto front, this article proposes a multiobjective evolutionary algorithm based on decomposition (MOEA/D) with an adaptive areal weight adjustment (AAWA) strategy to make a tradeoff between the total flight path length and the terrain threat. AAWA is designed to improve the diversity and uniformity of the solutions. More specifically, AAWA first removes a crowded individual and its weight vector from the current population and then adds a sparse individual from the external elite population to the current population. To enable the newly added individual to evolve toward the sparser area of the population in the objective space, its weight vector is constructed by the objective function value of its neighbors. The experimental results in three types of synthetic scenarios and one realistic scenario demonstrate that MOEA/D-AAWA achieves uniformly distributed and diverse path solutions on sharp peaks and low tails, and provides a desired and collision-free compromise path.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=10648747,IEEE Transactions on Aerospace and Electronic Systems,2025
Multi-Objective Aerial Collaborative Secure Communication Optimization via Generative Diffusion Model-Enabled Deep Reinforcement Learning,"Due to flexibility and low-cost, unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) are increasingly crucial for enhancing coverage and functionality of wireless networks. However, incorporating UAVs into next-generation wireless communication systems poses significant challenges, particularly in sustaining high-rate and long-range secure communications against eavesdropping attacks. In this work, we consider a UAV swarm-enabled secure surveillance network system, where a UAV swarm forms a virtual antenna array to transmit sensitive surveillance data to a remote base station (RBS) via collaborative beamforming (CB) so as to resist mobile eavesdroppers. Specifically, we formulate an aerial secure communication and energy efficiency multi-objective optimization problem (ASCEE-MOP) to maximize the secrecy rate of the system and to minimize the flight energy consumption of the UAV swarm. To address the non-convex, NP-hard and dynamic ASCEE-MOP, we propose a generative diffusion model-enabled twin delayed deep deterministic policy gradient (GDMTD3) method. Specifically, GDMTD3 leverages an innovative application of diffusion models to determine optimal excitation current weights and position decisions of UAVs. The diffusion models can better capture the complex dynamics and the trade-off of the ASCEE-MOP, thereby yielding promising solutions. Simulation results highlight the superior performance of the proposed approach compared with traditional deployment strategies and some other deep reinforcement learning (DRL) benchmarks. Moreover, performance analysis under various parameter settings of GDMTD3 and different numbers of UAVs verifies the robustness of the proposed approach.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=10759093,IEEE Transactions on Mobile Computing,2025
Tensor-Based Sparsity-Inducing Localization of AAV Swarms-Assisted Mobile Edge Computing Systems,"Autonomous aerial vehicle (AAV)-assisted mobile edge computing systems have high mobility and can be deployed in various rugged terrain and emergency scenarios for communication and monitoring. However, the malicious use of AAV swarms poses a potential threat to key areas. Therefore, accurate positioning of AAV swarms is crucial for the security of high-value civilian facilities and equipment. This article investigates angle estimation of coherent signals from AAV swarms in bistatic multiple-input multiple-output radar under nonuniform noise. The nonuniform noise powers are iteratively estimated based on the structural characteristics of the covariance matrix and subsequently removed from the observations. Transmission-reception diversity smoothing is then applied to the signal subspace, obtained through higher order singular value decomposition, to recover the rank deficiency. Furthermore, a block sparse reconstruction method is proposed, utilizing the reweighted smoothed $\ell _{0}$-norm, to obtain angle estimates. This method automatically pairs the direction-of-arrivals and direction-of-departures of AAVs. Experimental results demonstrate the superiority of our approach over existing solutions.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=105001066893&origin=inward,IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics,2025
Physical Layer Security Enhancement in AAV-Assisted Cooperative Jamming for Cognitive Radio Networks: A MAPPO-LSTM Deep Reinforcement Learning Approach,"Cognitive Radio (CR) and Energy Harvesting (EH) techniques have offered insights to mitigate issues related to inefficient spectrum utilization and limited energy storage capacity. In Cognitive Radio Networks, security threats, particularly from eavesdroppers, may result in information leakage. This study focuses on enhancing the Physical Layer Security (PLS) of multi-users with EH by employing cooperative jamming via a Autonomous Aerial Vehicle (AAV) to maximize the secure communication rate. In the AAV-assisted EH-CR system, Secondary Users (SUs) can utilize the licensed spectrum band occupied by a Primary User (PU) if the cooperative jamming power from SUs to the PU remains below a certain threshold. SUs can harvest and use Radio Frequency (RF) energy from the Primary Transmitter (PT). The AAV jammer disrupts the eavesdropper by transmitting jamming signals, thereby minimizing stolen information to optimize long-term secure communication performance. The paper formulates the problem of maximizing the average secure communication rate while considering system constraints and jointly optimizes the AAV trajectory, transmission power, and EH coefficient. As the problem is non-convex, it is reformulated as a Markov Decision Process (MDP). The paper employs the Multi-Agent Proximal Policy Optimization (MAPPO) algorithm to address the problem, introduces counterfactual baselines to tackle the credit assignment problem in centralized learning, and integrates the Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) network to enhance the learning capability of sequential sample data, thereby improving the training efficiency and effectiveness of the algorithm. Simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness and superiority of the proposed method in maximizing the system's secure communication rate.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=10734220,IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology,2025
Smart Shield: Prevent Aerial Eavesdropping via Cooperative Intelligent Jamming Based on Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning,"The spotlight on autonomous aerial vehicles (AAVs) is to enhance wireless communications while ignoring the potential risk of AAVs acting as adversaries. Due to their mobility and flexibility, AAV eavesdroppers pose an immeasurable threat to legitimate wireless transmissions. However, the existing fixed jamming scheme without cooperation cannot counter the flexible and dynamic AAV eavesdropping. In this article, a cooperative intelligent jamming scheme is proposed, authorizing ground jammers (GJs) to interfere with AAV eavesdroppers, generating specific jamming shields between AAV eavesdroppers and legitimate users. Toward this end, we formulate a secrecy capacity maximization problem and model the problem as a decentralized partially observable Markov decision process (Dec-POMDP). To address the challenge of the huge state space and action space with network dynamics, we leverage a deep reinforcement learning (DRL) algorithm with a dueling network and double-Q learning (i.e., dueling double deep Q-network) to train policy networks. Then, we propose a multi-agent mixing network framework (QMIX)-based collaborative jamming algorithm to enable GJs to independently make decisions without sharing local information. Additionally, we perform extensive simulations to validate the superiority of our proposed scheme and present useful insights into practical implementation by elucidating the relationship between the deployment settings of GJs and the instantaneous secrecy capacity.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=86000736626&origin=inward,IEEE Transactions on Mobile Computing,2025
Enhanced Ground Fissure Detection in Mining Areas Based on Visible–Infrared Image Fusion and YOLOv5,"Intensive mining operations can lead to the formation of fissures caused by ground subsidence, which present significant threats to building stability, coal mine safety, and the ecological environment. Accurate and timely detection of these fissures is crucial for effective risk management and mitigation. This article proposes FisFusionYOLO, a novel method that integrates visible–infrared image fusion with a YOLOv5 deep learning network to enhance fissure detection accuracy and efficiency. By combining complementary information from visible and infrared images, the fusion strategy improves the representation of fissure features, which are then processed by the YOLOv5 network for precise and efficient object detection. A dataset collected from the Daliuta Mine in the Shendong Mining Area, using a uncrewed aerial vehicle (UAV) equipped with infrared and visible sensors, demonstrates the effectiveness of the FisFusionYOLO. The method achieves a mean average precision (mAP) score of 82.6%, surpassing those trained on visible and infrared image datasets. Furthermore, FisFusionYOLO exhibits superior generalization performance (77.1% mAP), compared to 24.2% for the visible image detector and 24.2% for the infrared image detector. A statistical analysis of fissure distribution and self-healing properties, based on the detection results, provides valuable insights for proactive risk mitigation. This approach offers a robust, automated solution for monitoring ground fissures in mining areas by integrating advanced image fusion techniques with deep learning. The proposed method can contribute to improved safety practices and environmental protection by enabling early detection and systematic assessment of fissure-related hazards.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=10933510,IEEE Journal of Selected Topics in Applied Earth Observations and Remote Sensing,2025
Security and Safety-Critical Learning-Based Collaborative Control for Multiagent Systems,"This article presents a novel learning-based collaborative control framework to ensure communication security and formation safety of nonlinear multiagent systems (MASs) subject to denial-of-service (DoS) attacks, model uncertainties, and barriers in environments.

Adaptively Event-Triggered $H\infty$ Control for Networked Autonomous Aerial Vehicles Control Systems Under Deception Attacks,"This article investigates a new $H\infty$ control method for networked control systems (NCSs) under deception attacks, and applies it to autonomous aerial vehicles (AAVs). First, a novel adaptively event-triggered strategy (AETS) is proposed for reducing the transmitted data packets. Compared with existing ETS, the proposed AETS can adaptively adjust the event-triggered threshold and save limited networked resources in light of weighted average error. Second, a networked closed-loop system model is constructed by considering AETS, deception attacks, and network-induced delays. Then, the expected $H\infty$ control performance can be ensured in parallel with saving limited communication resources through the derived stability criterion. Finally, the validity and advantage of the presented approach are proved by a AAV system.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=105002311531&origin=inward,IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics,2025
EPIC: A Lightweight LiDAR-Based AAV Exploration Framework for Large-Scale Scenarios,"Autonomous exploration is a fundamental problem for various applications of autonomous aerial vehicles (AAVs). Recently, LiDAR-based exploration has gained significant attention due to its ability to generate high-precision point cloud maps of large-scale environments. While the point clouds are inherently informative for navigation, many existing exploration methods still rely on additional, often expensive, environmental representations. This reliance stems from two main reasons: the need for frontier detection or information gain computation, which typically depends on memory-intensive occupancy grid maps, and the high computational complexity of path planning directly on point clouds, primarily due to costly collision checking. To address these limitations, we present EPIC, a lightweight LiDAR-based AAV exploration framework that directly exploits point cloud data to explore large-scale environments. EPIC introduces a novel observation map based on the quality of point clouds, treating the environment as a collection of small surface patches and evaluating their observation quality. It maintains and updates this quality using spatial hashing. By guiding the AAV from well-observed to poorly-observed areas, EPIC eliminates the need for global occupancy grid maps, while ensuring robust exploration and effective performance across diverse environments. We also propose an incremental topological graph construction method operating directly on point clouds, enabling real-time path planning in large-scale environments. Leveraging these components, we build a hierarchical planning framework that generates agile and energy-efficient trajectories, achieving significantly reduced memory consumption and computation time compared to most existing methods. Extensive simulations and real-world experiments demonstrate that EPIC achieves faster exploration while significantly reducing memory consumption compared to state-of-the-art methods.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=10945408,IEEE Robotics and Automation Letters,2025
Swarm Robotic Flocking With Aggregation Ability Privacy,"We address the challenge of achieving flocking behavior in swarm robotic systems without compromising the privacy of individual robots’ aggregation capabilities. Traditional flocking algorithms are susceptible to privacy breaches, as adversaries can deduce the identity and aggregation abilities of robots by observing their movements. We introduce a novel control mechanism for privacy-preserving flocking, leveraging the Laplace mechanism within the framework of differential privacy. Our method mitigates privacy breaches by introducing a controlled level of noise, thus obscuring sensitive information. We explore the trade-off between privacy and utility by varying the differential privacy parameter  $\epsilon $ . Our quantitative analysis reveals that  $\epsilon \leq 0.13$  represents a lower threshold where private information is almost completely protected, whereas  $\epsilon \geq 0.85$  marks an upper threshold where private information cannot be protected at all. Empirical results validate that our approach effectively maintains privacy of the robots’ aggregation abilities throughout the flocking process. Note to Practitioners—This paper was motivated by the problem of preserving privacy of individual robots in a swarm robotic system. Existing approaches to address this issue generally consider that accomplishing complex tasks requiring explicit information sharing between robots, while explicit communication in public channel carries the risk of information leakage. It is not always like this in real adversarial environments, and this assumption restricts the investigation of privacy in autonomous systems. This paper suggests that an individual robot can use its sensors onboard to perceive states of other neighbors in a distributed way without explicit communication. Despite avoiding information leakage during explicit information sharing between robots, the configuration of swarm can still reveal sensitive information about the ability of each robot. In this paper, we propose a privacy-preserving approach for flocking control using the Laplace mechanism based on the concept of differential privacy. The solution prevents an adversary with full knowledge of the swarm’s configuration from learning the sensitive information of individual robots, thus ensuring the security of swarm robots in terms of sensitive information during ongoing missions.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=10833710,IEEE Transactions on Automation Science and Engineering,2025
Asynchronous Secure Control of Fuzzy MJSs With Time Delays: A Multi-Level Probabilistic Event-Triggered Mechanism,"This paper investigates the event-triggered secure control problem for fuzzy Markov jump systems (MJSs) with time-varying delays. In order for higher resource efficiency, a multi-level probabilistic event-triggered mechanism (MLPETM) is newly established, which reduces the data transmission frequency by investigating possible variations of triggering thresholds. Given the network-induced phenomena, the MLPETM’s output may undergo cyber-attacks, and the controller may not switch synchronously along with the system. Asynchronous secure controllers are thus developed to perform secure control of fuzzy MJSs. Sufficient conditions dependent on fuzzy basis functions, state delays and jumping modes are established to guarantee the dissipative finite-time boundedness of the resultant closed-loop system. Afterward, an easy-to-check fuzzy secure control algorithm is developed to compute the controller gains. Finally, the one-link robotic arm system and the truck-trailer system are borrowed to validate the proposed results. Note to Practitioners—Networked control systems (NCSs) play a key role in real applications like automobile industry, power systems, and autonomous mobile robots. As a key part, the communication network such as Controller Area Network is embedded into the NCSs to perform the communication tasks between different control units. In spite of great benefits from the communication network, both the security and the efficiency issues of the data transmission are challenging for the engineering designer. Besides, the target physical system is usually nonlinear, and is very likely to undergo abrupt changes in the networked environment. In terms of these challenges, this paper studies the asynchronous security control of networked Markov jump systems with time-varying delays and randomly occurring cyber-attacks. A multi-level probabilistic event-triggered mechanism (MLPETM) is newly established, which studies the effect of the stochastic variation regarding the triggering threshold on the triggering performance. Potential cyber-attacks are modelled in a randomly occurring fashion and then absorbed into to the control law which allows operation modes asynchronous to the system modes. Finally, the one-link robotic arm system and the truck-trailer system are borrowed to check the proposed findings. Note that both the transmission security and communication traffic regulation are well concerned, which renders the developed method applicable to practical systems.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=10586901,IEEE Transactions on Automation Science and Engineering,2025
Semi-Supervised Domain Adaptation With Dual-Adversarial Learning for Lane Detection,"Lane detection approaches relying on abundant annotations have achieved great progress in autonomous driving. These approaches may suffer from performance collapse when directly applied to unseen images due to domain discrepancy. Most researches utilize unsupervised domain adaptation (UDA) to mitigate domain shifts. Despite this, there is still a large performance gap between UDA and supervised methods because lack of target supervision makes improving performance of cross-domain lane detection difficult. In this paper, we introduce semi-supervised domain adaptation (SSDA) to lane detection and develop a simple yet effective dual-adversarial learning scheme to minimize domain discrepancy. Specifically, we conduct global alignment by calculating entropy information of unlabeled target and source data to align entropy distribution and enhance feature confidence of lanes. Domain consistency adversarial learning is proposed to make full use of both source and unlabeled/labeled target data. A triplet of features is used to learn lane-invariant representations by distinguishing whether the feature belongs to same domain. This is conducive to promote consistency of lanes information in cross domain. In two datasets, our method obtains a better performance of 42.5% (54.9%) and 45.8% (64.1%) based on a small amount of target supervision. Experimental results demonstrate effectiveness of our method as well as its superiority to other methods in terms of reducing performance gap with supervised methods (https://github.com/shenhuqiji/LD-SSDA). Note to Practitioners—This paper focuses on the cross domain lane detection task to narrow domain discrepancy in lane detection among different scenarios for autonomous driving. It aims to reduce extra label annotations and retraining costs. Considering unsupervised domain adaptation method is hard to further improve detection performance when a large domain shift occurs in adaptation scenarios, we construct an effective dual-adversarial learning scheme based on semi-supervised domain adaptation for lane detection. This method takes as input a triplet of source data, unlabeled and labeled target data to effectively enhance cross domain detection accuracy, which is contributed to the perception tasks in driving scenarios, such as path and motion planning, lane departure warning, lane changing decisions. Our method has a better generalization ability in face of various scenarios and can be easily integrated in software platforms, which greatly facilitates the applications on intelligent systems in autonomous vehicles.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=10680388,IEEE Transactions on Automation Science and Engineering,2025
Self-Triggered MPC for Teleoperation of Networked Mobile Robotic System via High-Order Estimation,"Since the teleoperation process of networked mobile robotic systems (NMRSs) is generally affected by the coupling of the human force, complex dynamical model, external environment and nonholonomic constraints, designing an effectiveness control to guarantee the desired performance for the teleoperation task is a challenging work. Besides, due to the limitation of the communication and control technology, the controller for the teleoperation system is usually required to have low computation load and low monitoring sampling frequency. To address these challenges, a novel self-triggered model predictive control (STMPC) framework, being consisted of the local STMPC, high-order estimation and M/R fixed-time controller, is constructed. Compared to traditional MPC methods, our proposed local STMPC offers lower computational load and requires fewer monitoring resources while retaining the ability to optimize control performance and handle multiple constraints. Using the presented STMPC framework in a hierarchical manner and newly designed high-order estimation, we successfully and simultaneously solve the teleoperation task while accounting for the self-triggering mechanism, decentralized control implementation, disturbance rejection, and complex nonholonomic model. Additionally, we derive sufficient conditions for ensuring the stability of the closed-loop system. Finally, the simulation and experiment results are provided to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed STMPC framework. Note to Practitioners—Our research introduces a groundbreaking framework, self-triggered model predictive control (STMPC), specifically designed to elevate control efficiency, quality, and reliability in the context of remote operation of networked mobile robotic systems (NMRSs). This innovation holds immense promise, particularly in domains requiring the utilization of autonomous vehicle fleets, such as large-scale exploration, search and rescue missions, and escort operations in hazardous or hard-to-reach areas (e.g., forest firefighting, warzone patrolling, saturation attacks, and space escort). These environments are often characterized by extreme external conditions and unpredictable external influences, such as meteorite impacts, flames, obstacles, and explosions, posing significant challenges for the control and task execution of unmanned vehicle fleets. Moreover, these missions demand high precision and control responsiveness from the robotic clusters to swiftly accomplish urgent tasks. Consequently, the need arises for autonomous vehicle fleets that not only possess the capacity to adapt to various constraints and external disturbances but also execute mission tasks swiftly and precisely. STMPC, as presented in this paper, demonstrates its capability to address these issues and requirements effectively, making it a versatile and powerful tool for enhancing control and system performance in various scenarios.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=10623596,IEEE Transactions on Automation Science and Engineering,2025
Monitor-Based Supervisory Control of Labeled Petri Nets Under Sensor Attacks,"In this paper we investigate a supervisory control problem of discrete event systems under attacks. Specially, we consider a type of sensor deception attacks, called replacement attacks, under which the intruder confuses the observation of events by substituting the occurrence of an observation with another. We use labeled Petri nets as the reference formalism to model a discrete event system and represent control specifications in terms of generalized mutual exclusion constraints (GMECs). The concept of a monitor function is proposed to describe the satisfiability of GMECs given an observation by counting the number of occurrences of each label. Due to the existence of attacks, some labels generated by a plant are prone to be altered by an attacker, interfering with a supervisor such that it cannot make correct control decisions. For assisting the monitor function to estimate the number of occurrences of those altered-prone labels, generated by the plant, the notion of label dependency is introduced. Accordingly, a monitor-based supervisor is designed with low online computational effort, avoiding the marking estimation or the reachability analysis of the system. It is verified that the proposed supervisor not only enforces all GMECs no matter whether or not replacement attacks occur, but also keeps the system's behavior as permissive as possible. Note to Practitioners—Cyber physical systems (CPSs) have exhibited multifaceted applications in various fields such as process control systems, smart grids, distributed robotics, autonomous vehicles. Due to the over-reliance on communication networks, CPSs are vulnerable to attacks that can tamper the data collection processes and interfere safety critical decision making processes, resulting in catastrophic damages to the systems. In the frame of discrete event systems, most of existing supervisory control strategies of CPSs under attacks rely on an exhaustive reachability analysis, which is computationally expensive, making such approaches hardly applicable to large systems. In order to address this issue, this work considers a type of sensor deception attacks, called replacement attacks, and proposes a monitor-based supervisor policy, enforcing the control specifications of the systems in the presence of replacement attacks. Without requiring tedious analysis, the designed online supervisor has low computational effort and control decisions only depend on a direct analysis of the observation sequence.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=10772482,IEEE Transactions on Automation Science and Engineering,2025
An Adaptive Fault-Tolerant Control Scheme for Heterogeneous Multiagent Systems,"This article proposes an adaptive fault-tolerant control (FTC) scheme for heterogeneous multiagent systems with time-varying communication link faults and actuator faults. First, the communication link faults, including the channel signal fading and cyber bias attack, is considered, and the communication link fault compensation controller is designed through introducing the adaptive signals with the estimate of the norms of the faulty matrix. Then, by using the minimum eigenvalue of the control gain matrix, the minimum-eigenvalue-based adaptive fault-tolerant controller is proposed to compensate for the time-varying actuator loss of effectiveness and bias faults.

To alleviate the burden on the communication network, a novel HT-based event-triggered mechanism is proposed. An HT-based event-triggered control strategy is then developed for autonomous motorcade systems to counteract deception attacks. Sufficient conditions for the HT-based event-triggered autonomous motorcade tracking are derived using Lyapunov stability theory. Finally, the effectiveness and advantages of the proposed control strategy are verified through numerical simulation comparisons.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=105003020846&origin=inward,IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology,2025
Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning With Decentralized Distribution Correction,"This work considers decentralized multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL), where the global states and rewards are assumed to be fully observable, while the local behavior policy is preserved locally for resisting adversarial attack. In order to cooperatively accumulate more rewards, the agents exchange messages among a time-varying communication network to reach consensus. For these cooperative tasks, we propose a decentralized actor-critic algorithm, where the agents make individual decisions, but the joint behavior policy is optimized towards more cumulative rewards. We provide the theoretical analysis towards the convergence under the tabular setting and then expand it to nonlinear function approximations. Furthermore, by incorporating decentralized distribution correction, the agents are trained in an off-policy manner for higher sample efficiency. Finally, we conduct experiments to evaluate the algorithms, where the proposed algorithm performs competitively in both stability and asymptotic performance. Note to Practitioners—Fully decentralized MARL algorithms are widely applied in multi-agent systems for generating cooperative behaviors, e.g., multiple unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV) cooperatively performing search and rescue tasks, multiple vehicles efficiently passing a crowded intersection, and multiple robots cooperatively handling cargo or obstacles. Focusing on these potential applications, this work is motivated to improve the sample efficiency of recent decentralized MARL algorithms by incorporating off-policy training approaches. In this work, we reweight historical trajectories via a decentralized average consensus step and develop corresponding policy-optimization procedures, with which previous trajectories could be used to stabilize later iterations. Since the training materials are augmented by historical samples, the sample efficiency is significantly improved, and the training process is stabilized. With the fully decentralized training approach, the proposed algorithms are expected to be applied in large-scale systems, e.g., vehicle teams and UAV groups, for effective real-time control.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=10456565,IEEE Transactions on Automation Science and Engineering,2025
Actuator and Sensor Attacks Against Multisensor State Estimation With Round-Robin Protocol,"In this article, we focus on the security issue of multisensor state estimation under actuator and sensor attacks. Due to the limitation of network bandwidth, we consider a scenario where the sensor data is transmitted following a round-robin protocol. If attacks can access all actuator and sensor channels, the necessary and sufficient conditions for the existence of joint attacks are presented. In this case, the attacks can cause the estimation to diverge while the corrupted innovation remains the same as that of the healthy system. When the attacked actuator or sensor channels are constrained, the existence of such a joint attack is investigated by taking into account the kernel space of system matrices. If only the sensor data are compromised, there is no strictly stealthy sensor attack, and we discuss the existence of sensor attacks with a relaxed stealthiness. The simulations are carried out on an autonomous aircraft system and an IEEE 6-bus power system to verify the effectiveness of the developed theoretical results.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=10859163,IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics,2025
Reconfigurable Intelligent Computational Surfaces for MEC-Assisted Autonomous Driving Networks: Design Optimization and Analysis,"This paper focuses on improving autonomous driving safety via task offloading from cellular vehicles (CVs), using vehicle-to-infrastructure (V2I) links, to a multi-access edge computing (MEC) server. Considering that the V2I links sometimes can be reused by vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) communications to improve spectrum utilization, the receiver of the V2I link may suffer from severe interference, causing outages during the task offloading. To tackle this issue, we propose the deployment of a reconfigurable intelligent computational surface (RICS) to enable, not only V2I reflective links but also interference cancellation at the V2V links exploiting the computational capability of its metamaterials. We devise a joint optimization formulation for the task offloading ratio between the CVs and the MEC server, the spectrum sharing strategy between V2V and V2I communications, as well as the RICS reflection and refraction matrices, to maximize a safety-based autonomous driving task. Due to the non-convexity of the problem and the coupling among its free variables, we transform it into a more tractable equivalent form, which is then decomposed into three sub-problems and solved via an alternate approximation method. Simulation results show that the proposed RICS-assisted offloading framework significantly improves the safety of the autonomous driving network, in which the safety coefficient of the CVs is improved by nearly 34%. The V2V data rate is improved by around 60%, which indicates that the RICS’s adjustment of the signals can effectively mitigate the interference of the V2V link.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85208988542&origin=inward,IEEE Transactions on Intelligent Transportation Systems,2025
Large Beamforming Models for Robust Wireless Transmission in Generalized Scenes of RIS-Aided Intelligent IoV Network,"In recent years, concomitant with the rapid advancements in large models (LMs) technologies within the field of artificial intelligence (AI), the domain of intelligent Internet of Vehicles (IoV) network has also experienced swift progress. Those potential applications such as autonomous driving, intelligent driver assistance systems, personalized driver experience, and traffic flow and urban mobility management are dependent on the excellent IoV wireless communications system. However, there still exist many fundamental challenges when involving LMs into IoV network. How to provide effective coverage for intervening massive heterogeneous terminals in complex dynamic wireless network environments is a challenging problem. Besides, the generalization and robustness of beamforming within various scenarios are the fundamental for IoV applications mentioned above. To address the aforementioned issues, we in this paper formulate and integrate LMs to achieve excellent hybrid beamforming within IoV wireless communications system which is aided by reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (RISs) and base stations (BSs) to provide additional channels and coverage gains. Benefiting from RISs, wireless channels become complex and reconstructable, thus providing the possibility of creating LMs based hybrid beamforming. The proposed LMs are formulated by utilizing deep reinforcement learning (DRL) to effectively interact with environments so that robust beamforming can be maintained within RIS aided IoV network. Finally, we exploit the excellent performance of LMs enabled hybrid beamforming and investigate the impact of critical learning parameters. Comprehensive experimental results have consistently confirmed that the proposed LMs enabled hybrid beamforming for RIS aided IoV outperforms traditional schemes in the respect of system throughput and network coverage under dynamic wireless environments.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=10533201,IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology,2025
An Information-Assisted Deep Reinforcement Learning Path Planning Scheme for Dynamic and Unknown Underwater Environment,"An autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV) has shown impressive potential and promising exploitation prospects in numerous marine missions. Among its various applications, the most essential prerequisite is path planning. Although considerable endeavors have been made, there are several limitations. A complete and realistic ocean simulation environment is critically needed. As most of the existing methods are based on mathematical models, they suffer from a large gap with reality. At the same time, the dynamic and unknown environment places high demands on robustness and generalization. In order to overcome these limitations, we propose an information-assisted reinforcement learning path planning scheme. First, it performs numerical modeling based on real ocean current observations to establish a complete simulation environment with the grid method, including 3-D terrain, dynamic currents, local information, and so on. Next, we propose an information compression (IC) scheme to trim the mutual information (MI) between reinforcement learning neural network layers to improve generalization. A proof based on information theory provides solid support for this. Moreover, for the dynamic characteristics of the marine environment, we elaborately design a confidence evaluator (CE), which evaluates the correlation between two adjacent frames of ocean currents to provide confidence for the action. The performance of our method has been evaluated and proven by numerical results, which demonstrate a fair sensitivity to ocean currents and high robustness and generalization to cope with the dynamic and unknown underwater environment.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85178029122&origin=inward,IEEE Transactions on Neural Networks and Learning Systems,2025
Underwater Target Tracking Based on Interrupted Software-Defined Multi-AUV Reinforcement Learning: A Multi-AUV Time-Saving MARL Approach,"With the rapid development of underwater materials technology and underwater robot technology, human exploitation of marine resources has been increasingly advanced, which has given rise to various application scenarios for Autonomous Underwater Vehicle (AUV) cluster networks, such as cooperative data collection and target tracking. In this paper, we aim to explore how to utilize networking and swarm intelligence to improve the AUV cluster network’s target tracking performance in a time-saving manner. Specifically, on account of our previous work, we introduce an underwater interrupted mechanism and propose an Interrupted Software-Defined Multi-AUV Reinforcement Learning (ISD-MARL) architecture. For MARL algorithm in ISD-MARL, we propose a time-saving MARL algorithm, S-MADDPG, integrating our proposed action optimization model and action network loss function, to accelerate the convergence of the MARL algorithm. Furthermore, to further improve the AUV cluster network’s path planning performance during the target tracking, we propose an Interrupted Tracking Path Planning Scheme (ITPPS) for the AUV cluster network based on the proposed ISD-MARL and S-MADDPG. The evaluation results showcase that our proposed scheme can effectively plan the underwater target tracking path for the AUV cluster network in a shorter time and outperform various mainstream strategies in terms of convergence speed and training time, etc.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85208552561&origin=inward,IEEE Transactions on Mobile Computing,2025
Cooperative Active Learning-Based Dual Control for Exploration and Exploitation in Autonomous Search,"In this article, a multi-estimator based computationally efficient algorithm is developed for autonomous search in an unknown environment with an unknown source. Different from the existing approaches that require massive computational power to support nonlinear Bayesian estimation and complex decision-making process, an efficient cooperative active-learning-based dual control for exploration and exploitation (COAL-DCEE) is developed for source estimation and path planning. Multiple cooperative estimators are deployed for environment learning process, which is helpful to improving the search performance and robustness against noisy measurements. The number of estimators used in COAL-DCEE is much smaller than that of the particles required for Bayesian estimation in information-theoretic approaches. Consequently, the computational load is significantly reduced. As an important feature of this study, the convergence and performance of COAL-DCEE are established in relation to the characteristics of sensor noises and turbulence disturbances. Numerical and experimental studies have been carried out to verify the effectiveness of the proposed framework. Compared with the existing approaches, COAL-DCEE not only provides convergence guarantee but also yields comparable search performance using much less computational power.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85182351516&origin=inward,IEEE Transactions on Neural Networks and Learning Systems,2025
Decentralized Multilayer Master-Slave Control Strategy for Power Management in Autonomous DC Microgrid Clusters,"DC microgrid clusters are effective solutions for integrating multiple autonomous subgrids at the same and different voltage levels. In such a system, global power management is an essential concern, but it is always degraded by system structures and line impedances of distributed generation units (DGUs). To solve this problem, a decentralized multilayer master-slave control strategy is proposed. In the selected master DGU, an ac signal is injected into the output voltage, and power information is carried by its frequency and consequently broadcast to other slave DGUs via power lines. In slave DGUs, the output power is regulated to track the demodulated power information, which generates voltage offset to realize power sharing in a single subgrid. The interlinking converter is exploited for interconnection between two subgrids, it is also used to transmit the broadcast power information from one subgrid to another one, which therefore ensures global power management throughout the dc microgrid cluster. All the control algorithms rely on only local measurement, and information transmission is implemented via existing power lines, no dedicated communication network is required. The effectiveness of the proposed strategy is validated by hardware-in-loop and experimental results.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85218393813&origin=inward,IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics,2025
Dynamic Coordination of Multiple Movable Bridges and Vessels for Time-Efficient Inland Waterway Navigation,"This paper considers the presence of movable bridges in inland waterway transport, and presents a control framework for the joint dynamic coordination of bridge operations and autonomous vessel navigation to minimize waiting times of vessels at bridges. Simultaneous evolution of bridge occupancy and vessel position is captured by a control-oriented model that incorporates qualitative behavior in the form of propositional logic expressions. A model predictive control (MPC) strategy is designed considering adaptable bridge opening regimes to exploit vessel passage demand, and operational preferences of both vessel skippers and bridge operators are taken into account to reach fair trade-off decisions. A realistic case study pertaining to the Rhine-Alpine corridor is used to demonstrate the effectiveness of the approach. Appropriate key performance indicators (KPIs) are defined and employed for a quantitative comparison with a mixed-integer programming (MIP) strategy with fixed opening regimes. Furthermore, sensitivity to the main MPC parameters is examined by carrying out extensive testing to assess the effect of each design parameter on the solution.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=10851389,IEEE Transactions on Intelligent Transportation Systems,2025
Multichannel Enhanced Millimeter-Wave SAR Imaging via Low-Rank Tensor-Train Decomposition,"Millimeter-wave (mmWave) synthetic aperture radar (SAR) has found wide applications in autonomous driving, landslide detection, urban mapping, etc. However, the high propagation loss of mmWave bands and the limitation of transmitting power have led to limited imaging performance for mmWave SAR. In this article, an enhanced SAR imaging framework that combines along-track multiple channels is proposed using a low-rank tensor-train (TT) decomposition method, which is applicable for a co-located multiple input multiple output (MIMO) array or a phased-transmitting-digital-receiving array. First, the multichannel images are stacked into a tensor form after SAR imaging on individual channels and spatial variant array phase correction for each pixel. Then, the low-rank property of tensor stack is exploited and the TT model is utilized to find the redundancy and leverage the intrinsic structure of image stack. In addition, ket augmentation is introduced to exhibit the local data structure more clearly than the original tensor under TT decomposition. Finally, tensor-train nuclear norm is used to relax the NP-hard problem with low-rank constraint and the minimization problem is solved in the framework of alternating direction method of multipliers for enhanced imaging. The proposed algorithm can effectively improve the working distance and image quality of mmWave SAR. Numerical experiments using simulated data of MIMO SAR and measured data collected by a ground-based phased-transmitting-digital-receiving array system are carried out to verify the performance of the proposed algorithm.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=86000386092&origin=inward,IEEE Journal of Selected Topics in Applied Earth Observations and Remote Sensing,2025
Deep Learning-Based Hybrid Dynamic Modeling and Improved Handling Stability Assessment for Autonomous Vehicles at Driving Limits,"This paper addresses the critical challenges of dynamic modeling and quantitative assessment of handling stability for autonomous vehicles (AVs). To meet the high safety standards in AVs, especially under conditions at driving limits, it is essential to employ precise dynamic models that match real-world system responses as closely as possible and provide reliable, quantitative evaluations of handling safety levels. We propose a deep learning-based hybrid dynamic modeling approach that integrates a designed recurrent neural network with vehicle physical models to enhance the traceability and interpretability of prevailing data-driven models. Utilizing recorded vehicle data, we first train the designed neural network to learn vehicle dynamic responses, thereby enhancing modeling accuracy. Then, the knowledge-based physical model and trained network model interact with each other and are mixed by exploiting the unscented Kalman filter. Furthermore, a comprehensive metric is developed to quantify the level of vehicle handling stability. We propose a multivariate dynamic representation to facilitate the analysis of complex vehicle dynamic behaviors. The mathematical definition of the handling safety metric is provided. Finally, hardware-in-the-loop (HIL) experiments are carried out to validate the proposed methods. Experimental results verify the effectiveness and better performance of the proposed hybrid dynamic model and handling safety metric. This work holds promising implications for accelerating the release and deployment of AVs.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85211986053&origin=inward,IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology,2025

Safety-Critical Disturbance Rejection Control of Nonlinear Systems With Unmatched Disturbances,"Safety-critical control is significant for autonomous system applications where safety is an utmost concern. Control-barrier-function (CBF)-based control has shown its promising potential and power in delivering formal safe property of dynamic nonlinear systems. The presence of disturbances, whether from matched or unmatched channels, negatively impacts CBF-based control, leading to violations of formal safety guarantees and degraded control performance. In this article, a new safety-critical disturbance rejection control approach is proposed for nonlinear systems subject to unmatched disturbances. Owing to the naturally intractable mismatching condition, the disturbances and their high order derivatives could generate considerable negative impacts on not only the high order CBF but also the control Lyapunov function. To this end, an observer-based disturbance rejection CBF is proposed, delivering a new robust adaptive mechanism to deal with the disturbances. It is shown that by fully exploiting the disturbance estimates and adequately quantifying the impacts of estimation errors, the proposed approach provides attractive properties like formal robust safety guarantee and nominal control performance recovery under unmatched disturbances. Simulation results of path following of a drone suffering wind disturbances verify the benefits of the proposed solution in collision avoidance and retaining nominal safety performance.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=10750414,IEEE Transactions on Automatic Control,2025
UAV Hyperspectral Remote Sensing Image Classification: A Systematic Review,"In recent years, significant advances in unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) technology and hyperspectral remote sensing have spurred rapid and innovative developments in UAV-based hyperspectral image (HSI) classification across a range of fields, including environmental monitoring, precision agriculture, forest health assessment, and disaster management. Compared to spaceborne platforms, the spectra of ground objects observed by UAV platforms exhibit notable variations, presenting more pronounced challenges for accurate classification. This article provides an in-depth and systematic review of UAV HSI classification techniques, systematically examining the evolution from traditional machine learning approaches, such as sparse coding, compressed sensing, and kernel methods, to cutting-edge deep learning frameworks, including convolutional neural networks, Transformer models, recurrent neural networks, graph convolutional networks, generative adversarial networks, and hybrid models. Although traditional methods demonstrate effectiveness in certain scenarios, their limitations become increasingly apparent when dealing with high-dimensional, nonlinear spectral data. In contrast, deep learning-based models excel at capturing intricate relationships between spectral and spatial features, significantly boosting classification accuracy and emerging as the dominant paradigm in the field. The WHU-Hi hyperspectral remote sensing dataset is utilized as a case study to elucidate the advantages and limitations of various deep learning methods through rigorous qualitative and quantitative comparisons. The potential of UAV hyperspectral image classification techniques in addressing high-dimensional data and complex scenarios is also thoroughly described.

Optimal Robust Formation of Multi-Agent Systems as Adversarial Graphical Apprentice Games With Inverse Reinforcement Learning,"This paper introduces a novel approach to solving robust optimal formation control problems in heterogeneous multi-agent systems (MASs) with disturbances. Our approach frames this problem as an adversarial graphical apprentice game problem, using the game concept and an inverse reinforcement learning (IRL) algorithm. This work innovates the derivation of unknown reward functions through demonstrations to achieve the desired formation. In addition, we define learner, estimator, and expert MASs as separate entities. This aim is achieved by introducing a model-based IRL algorithm with three stages of learning. After determining the optimal control of estimators in the first stage, the optimal control of learners is found in the second stage by using them. In the third stage, the reward functions of the estimator and learner MASs are updated in the inverse optimal control (IOC) stage simultaneously. Following that, we present an algorithm for model-free IRL that does not require knowledge of learner agents’ dynamics and can reconstruct reward functions after observing online trajectories. As subproblems, both proposed IRL algorithms address optimal control and IOC. We analyze these approaches for stability and convergence and demonstrate that state reward weights are non-unique. Simulation results show the effectiveness of the introduced algorithms for a group of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs). Note to Practitioners—Designing an optimal controller is challenging in MAS, especially where we only have access to the optimal reference path. The challenge is compounded if we do not know the agents’ dynamics and the appropriate reward function needed to achieve the desired path. This article proposes two IRL algorithms with the motivation to solve this problem. This study considers the optimal reference path for agents as expert MAS. Also, the MAS, we want to follow the desired path with the minor error, is represented as a learner MAS. The proposed approach is suitable for a large class of linear MAS since we have modeled the learner MAS with disturbance. Therefore, this method suits tracking, path-planning, and optimal formation problems in MASs. It requires minimal information but yields impressive results.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85196117480&origin=inward,IEEE Transactions on Automation Science and Engineering,2025
Toward Collaborative and Cross-Environment UAV Classification: Federated Semantic Regularization,"The rapid and widespread adoption of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) poses significant threats to public safety and security in sensitive areas and subsequently underscores the urgent need for effective UAV surveillance solutions, where UAV classification emerges as a vital technology. Deep learning (DL) methods can autonomously extract implicit features from UAV signals and subsequently infer their types, provided that sufficient signal samples are available. Due to the high mobility of UAVs, it is challenging to ensure continuous monitoring between UAVs and the surveillance system to obtain sufficient samples. Moreover, DL models developed from sufficient but environment-specific datasets tend to be less generalized. This paper proposes a novel federated semantic regularization for learning an UAV classification model and further classifying UAVs across diverse environmental conditions. The approach enhances model generalization by regularizing semantic features during the local model training process on each participant. Subsequently, these local models are aggregated into a robust global model. Extensive testing across multiple environments demonstrates the superior classification performance of our approach compared to existing non-federated and federated approaches. The average classification accuracy of the proposed method in the three environments is 95.68%, which is improved by 13.39% compared to the non-federated methods and by 2.75% compared to the federated methods.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85216109730&origin=inward,IEEE Transactions on Information Forensics and Security,2025
Pine Wilt Disease Monitoring Using Multimodal Remote Sensing Data and Feature Classification,"Pine wilt disease (PWD) is a significant global threat to pine trees, often referred to as the “cancer of pines.” It poses a severe risk to the ecological diversity and forest resources of pine forests, making effective monitoring and control critical in global vegetation protection. With advancements in artificial intelligence (AI) and remote sensing technologies, new solutions have emerged for PWD monitoring. However, existing AI-based methods typically rely on high-resolution optical images (e.g., satellite or unmanned aerial vehicle images), which are vulnerable to environmental factors such as clouds and fog, posing challenges for practical applications. To address this, the present study introduces temporal moisture content data derived from synthetic aperture radar (SAR) and aims to combine it with optical data through a multimodal data fusion approach for more effective PWD monitoring. To facilitate practical implementation, we developed a deep learning-based model, PWD-Net, which efficiently integrates these multimodal data for the monitoring of diseased pine trees. Statistical analysis of SAR-derived moisture content reveals significant differences in moisture variation patterns between diseased and healthy trees, enhancing the interpretability of the input features for the neural network. Experimental results demonstrate that PWD-Net achieves excellent generalization across different regions, handles cross-year data effectively, and shows strong robustness to spatial and temporal variations.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=10919026,IEEE Journal of Selected Topics in Applied Earth Observations and Remote Sensing,2025
A Deep Reinforcement Learning Method for Collision Avoidance with Dense Speed-Constrained Multi-UAV,"This letter introduces a novel deep reinforcement learning (DRL) method for collision avoidance problem of fixed-wing unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs).

Context-Aware Sim-to-Real Unsupervised Domain Adaptation for Lane Detection via Disentangled Feature Alignment,"While existing supervised deep learning-based lane detection methods achieve exceptional detection performance, constructing a large real-world dataset with labels is a cost-intensive task. Therefore, we propose a novel sim-to-real unsupervised domain adaptation method specialized in lane detection. In this paper, we present a disentangled feature alignment approach that performs selective adaptation for lane and background features. By performing the disentangled prototype-based local and global feature alignments, we solve the negative transfer problem of an existing adversarial feature alignment-based domain adaptation for lane detection. In addition, the lane detection task requires accurate localization of the lanes even in occluded parts. Therefore, we adopt a consistency regularization strategy using masked images to improve the detection accuracy in the occluded area. Additionally, we introduce an adaptive resolution adjustment of the masked-out patch based on training maturity for context learning. By applying a simple framework, we achieve superior lane detection accuracy with lower false positives and false negatives in the target domain compared to conventional methods. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superiority of the proposed method. Note to Practitioners—Lane detection plays a major role in autonomous vehicles by predicting the location of lanes on a road. In particular, deep learning-based lane detection models aim to output robust detection results in various environments, including different weather and road types. Because deep learning models are highly dependent on the distribution of training datasets, models trained with datasets acquired in a given environment can cause significant performance degradation when tested in different environments. Therefore, improving the generalizability of the lane detection model in the real-world application requires a vast training dataset. However, it is impractical to collect and label the real-world datasets including multiple road environments. We propose a novel training strategy for the lane detection models trained with simulation datasets to achieve high detection performance even on the real-world dataset. In other words, we introduce knowledge transfer methods for enhancing stability of the models trained with simulation datasets on real roads. In addition, we expect that the proposed method will transform the manual process of collecting and labeling real-world datasets into automatic creation of simulation-based learning datasets.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=10964297,IEEE Transactions on Automation Science and Engineering,2025

Driving State-Aware Anomaly Detection for Autonomous Vehicles,"With the increasing popularity of autonomous driving systems (ADS) in autonomous vehicles (AV), in recent years, there have been many attacks targeting AVs and ADSs. Meanwhile, recent studies have attempted to improve the safety and security of AVs from different perspectives, and they mainly focus on the spoofing attacks against the sensors and the injection attacks against the vehicle chassis and actuators. However, direct attacks on ADSs (i.e., communication hijacking and malicious codes) remain inadequately addressed, and even worse, such attacks can cause AVs to make unsafe driving decisions rapidly. In this paper, we introduce DSAD, a driving state-aware anomaly detection framework designed to enhance AV safety and security by identifying ADS attacks, such as communication hijacking and malicious codes, through chassis states. First, DSAD models ADS operations (i.e., driving states) as a two-layer state machine, utilizing real-time chassis data to infer driving states and detect anomalies in ADS outputs. This reduces false positives and negatives by aligning detection with the diverse operational modes of AVs. To achieve this, we develop a prototype system, DSAD, incorporating a Detection Policy Update mechanism that dynamically adjusts detection policies based on the vehicle’s driving states, such as lane changing and obstacle avoidance. Second, DSAD considers both collision avoidance and control stability, addressing potential conflicts through hard and soft requirements. Furthermore, DSAD integrates a fault handling module compatible with existing autonomous driving fault handling mechanisms, ensuring timely response to detected anomalies. We develop a prototype anomaly detection system called DSAD and deploy it on four ADSs. We evaluate DSAD using various attack scenarios, and the results show that DSAD can identify over 90% of attacks on ADSs.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=105002492590&origin=inward,IEEE Transactions on Information Forensics and Security,2025
Efficient Adversarial Attacks Against DRL-Based Resource Allocation in Intelligent O-RAN for V2X,"Artificial intelligence (AI) is projected to be a critical part of open radio access networks (O-RAN) to enable intelligence for connectivity management in smart vehicle-to-everything (V2X) networks and vehicle road cooperation systems. However, the openness and dependence of AI models on massive volumes of data render them subject to serious security vulnerabilities, such as adversarial attacks. This study investigates security issues in O-RAN's near real-time RAN intelligent controller (RIC), with an emphasis on deep reinforcement learning (DRL)-based resource allocation. We introduce a novel attack manipulating environmental observations to mislead AI agents, resulting in erroneous allocations and decreased physical resource block (PRB) transmission rates for various vehicular communications. We also discover flaws where compromised users or signal jammers can fake signal power to trick the AI agent's state observation. This can lead to a policy infiltration attack that makes the network performance drop significantly. Evaluation results show up to a 40% decline in user data rates, a 77.74% reduction in packet delivery rates, and significant disruptions in ultra-reliable and low-latency communications (uRLLC) services such as remote driving and connected automated vehicles. The policy infiltration attack causes a 20% increase in packet losses and up to 150% delay overall. The attack efficiency emphasizes the need for adversarial training in protecting AI-driven applications, which should be addressed in future O-RAN security specifications and AI-powered vehicular networks.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=10697477,IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology,2025
Robust Distributed Average Tracking With Disturbance Observer Control,"This paper is concerned with the study of robust distributed average tracking (DAT) algorithms for networked control systems in the presence of external disturbances or false data injection attacks (FDIAs). To eliminate the impacts of external disturbances and FDIAs, the technologies of disturbance-observer-based control (DOBC) and active disturbance rejection control (ADRC) are introduced into the context of DAT problems. First, for a class of external disturbances with known dynamics, we propose an anti-disturbance DAT (AD-DAT) algorithm, where a stand-alone disturbance observer based on the idea of DOBC is employed to estimate the disturbance and then to compensate it in the design of control inputs. The proposed AD-DAT algorithm can track the average of multiple time-varying reference signals with zero steady-state error and the accurate tracking is robust with respect to initialization constraints. Furthermore, for another class of FDIAs with unknown dynamics, we design an anti-attack DAT (AA-DAT) algorithm where the control input is based on the estimates of states instead of original states, and construct an extended state observer including a state observer and an FDIAs observer based on the idea of ADRC. The extended state observer plays a key role in estimating and eliminating the impact of FDIAs without compromising the accurate tracking performance. In addition, sufficient conditions are derived for the proposed two algorithms from a theoretical point of view to guarantee accurate average tracking. Finally, some numerical examples are given to illustrate the validity and effectiveness of the proposed algorithms. Note to Practitioners—This paper is motivated by the problem of robust distributed average tracking (DAT) for the time-varying centroid of the formation of a group of autonomous vehicles. The problem arises in the scenario where two groups of unmanned ground vehicles (UGVs) and unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) perform a combined surveillance-reconnaissance mission (where the UAVs aim to provide aerial coverage and early warning against threats for the UGVs, as shown in Fig. 1) in an uncertain environment where the external disturbances might exist or the FDIAs might be launched by adversaries. Obviously, the tracking accuracy of the target signal will be compromised in the presence of external disturbances or FDIAs. However, most existing works for disturbance rejection mainly focused on the static average consensus rather than the dynamic one even though a few works mentioned the DAT problem with only considering the case of external disturbances. Based on this, we propose an AD-DAT algorithm and an AA-DAT algorithm for the DAT problem based on the ideas of DOBC and ADRC, respectively. Numerical examples show that the proposed algorithms are able to estimate and eliminate the impacts of the external disturbances and the FDIAs, which implies that the algorithms can be implemented in practical scenarios. In future research, we will extend the results to more general scenarios in the presence of external disturbances and FDIAs.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=10418538,IEEE Transactions on Automation Science and Engineering,2025
Cooperative Tracking of Quadrotor UAVs Using Parallel Optimal Learning Control,"The cooperative tracking control issue of quadrotor unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) is investigated, where a cluster of UAVs is required to maintain a preassigned pattern while tracking a reference trajectory. Since only a part of UAVs can access the reference trajectory, an adaptive distributed estimator is developed such that each UAV could obtain the accurate estimate exponentially. Based on the hierarchical development, a parallel optimal learning control strategy is proposed by introducing virtual artificial systems that generate the practical control commands. In particular, a saturated force command is exploited for the position loop tracking to the estimated trajectory and a torque command is utilized to ensure the command attitude tracking, respectively. Moreover, a data-based learning law is designed for the critic weight under the finite excitation (FE), which is made available for the inadmissible initial control. It is shown that the overall closed-loop system is uniformly ultimately bounded and the tracking errors eventually converge to small sets around zero. Simulation and experiment results further verify the proposed control strategy. Note to Practitioners—This paper is inspired by the cooperative formation control issue of quadrotor UAVs. In practical missions like surveillance and reconnaissance, a UAV comes into or leaves out of the cluster may lead to re-tune the control parameters for all the involved UAVs. To save the onboard resource, the communication topology among the UAVs cannot be tedious. The proposed parallel learning strategy is implemented as follows. First, we design an adaptive distributed estimator for each UAV that could obtain the reference information accurately. Then, we propose a data-based parallel optimal learning strategy for each UAV that tracks the estimated reference trajectory. Since the proposed strategy does not require any global information regarding the communication topology, the parameters can be remained when the UAV cluster needs to extend or reduce, which makes it more practical. Finally, the proposed strategy is validated by both simulation and experiment results.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=10508997,IEEE Transactions on Automation Science and Engineering,2025
Joint Beamforming and Power Allocation Strategy for NOMA Empowered ISAC Systems,"The emerging integrated sensing and communication paradigm has gained considerable recent attention due to its potential for supporting sensing and communication services simultaneously. To provide low-latency communication services for multiple communication users while sensing an unmanned aerial vehicle simultaneously, a non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) empowered integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) system is developed in this paper. To support the NOMA-empowered ISAC system efficiently, a beamforming-based cross-layer scheduling scheme is designed, which exploits the traffic dynamics information at the network layer and channel state information at the physical layer. Under the cross-layer scheduling scheme, an efficient joint beamforming, power allocation, and rate adaptation strategy is obtained via a developed Newton's method-based algorithm and the linear programming formulation. With the aid of the proposed strategy, the average delay in the communication task can be minimized while assuring sensing capability. Besides, an optimal tradeoff between the average delay and the average transmission power in the NOMA-empowered ISAC system is uncovered, which is further demonstrated by extensive numerical results.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=10697321,IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology,2025
Lightweight Dual-Stream SAR–ATR Framework Based on an Attention Mechanism-Guided Heterogeneous Graph Network,"Current methods synthetic aperture radar–automatic target recognition (SAR–ATR) research methods still struggle with overfitting due to small amounts of training data, as well as black-box opacity and high computational requirements. Unmanned aerial vehicles, as the mainstream means of acquiring SAR data, place higher requirements on ATR algorithms due to their flexible maneuvering characteristics. This article starts by studying the electromagnetic (EM) backscattering mechanism and the physical properties of SAR. We construct a heterogeneous graph for the first time to fully exploit both the EM scattering information of the target components and their interactions. Moreover, the multilevel multihead attention mechanism is introduced to the graph net to learn features from various topological structure levels. Additionally, we include a convolutional neural network based feature extraction net to replenish intuitive visual features. The above two nets form the lightweight dual-stream framework (LDSF). LDSF uses a feature fusion subnetwork to adaptively fuse the dual-stream features to maximize the final classification performance. The experiments use two more rigorous evaluation protocols on MSTAR and OpenSARShip, namely, once-for-all and less-for-more, which can rigorously assess the efficacy and generalization capability of the algorithms. The superiority of LDSF is verified.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85209933646&origin=inward,IEEE Journal of Selected Topics in Applied Earth Observations and Remote Sensing,2025
Dissipative Leaderless Formation via Nonfragile Memory Sampled-Data Control for Unmanned Surface Vehicles With Switching Topologies,"This article introduces the dissipative performance analysis into the formation control design for multiple unmanned surface vehicles (USVs) with exogenous disturbances. All USVs are coordinated under a leaderless framework, where the network communications are described by a set of undirected graphs varying in a Markovian switching manner. Without requiring continuously transmitted information, the memory sampled-data scheme is exploited to aperiodically sample the information of in-neighboring USVs for enabling discrete data transmission subject to time-varying delays dependent on Markovian jump modes. With the collection of the delayed sampling information, a nonfragile formation control protocol is novelly constructed not only to tolerate parameter perturbation but also to improve tuning performance. By defining formation error vectors facilitated with orthonormal transformation technique and algebraic graph theory, the concerned formation control problem is equivalently cast into analyzing the strict dissipativity of the resultant Markovian jump system with mode-dependent time-varying delays. To describe the holistic movement of the leaderless USV swarm, one promisingly derives a formation reference function characterized by a dynamical system with determined initial condition, whose state evolution is capable to be regulated. The validation of the theoretical results is performed by a water experiment.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85192728298&origin=inward,IEEE/ASME Transactions on Mechatronics,2025
Maximizing Computed Data in In-Band Full-Duplex UAV-Assisted IIoT Networks,"In this article, we consider an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) with an in-band full-duplex radio that is used to interconnect industrial Internet of things (IIoT) devices and exploit their computation and energy resources to help process data. We formulate a mixed integer linear program to optimize the first sampling rate of each device, second amount of data the UAV transmits and receives to/from a device, third position of the UAV over time, and finally the number of virtual machines used by devices and UAV to compute data. We also propose a distributed protocol to determine quantity using aforementioned points. Our results show that an IBFD-UAV has a higher max–min computed sampling rate as compared to when the UAV uses a half duplex radio. Moreover, the said protocol achieves a max–min rate that is 80% optimal.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=10731857,IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics,2025
SuRLLC: Secure Ultra-Reliable and Low Latency Communication in NOMA-UAV Intelligent Transportation Systems,"The ultra-reliable and low-latency communication (uRLLC) plays a vital role in road safety and traffic management of intelligent transportation systems (ITS). Integrating unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) and non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) has become a prospective strategy for uRLLC by separately establishing line-of-sight (LoS) link and simultaneous transmissions. The confidentiality and security of information transmission in the context of uRLLC faces serious challenges, due to the openness nature of the wireless medium. Different from traditional encryption methods, featured by high computing complexity and serious processing delay, physical layer security (PLS) exploits the inherent properties of the wireless medium to prevent transmitted messages from being eavesdropped. In addition, NOMA-UAV systems pose unique challenges for secure transmission due to potential stronger LoS channels between the source and the eavesdroppers. Therefore, in this paper, we investigate the confidentiality and security of a NOMA-UAV uRLLC system, under which an UAV serves two types of users with different requirements, i.e., secret users (both security and reliability) and public users (only reliability). Based on the tools of stochastic geometry, we address the challenges of secure communications caused by the mobility of UAV, and derive the closed-form expression of secrecy rate maximization, a key metric for observing the key system parameters on the security and reliability. Furthermore, joint design of UAV trajectory and transmit power is proposed to enhance the system security. Finally, compared with popular PLS scheme empowered by UAV trajectory design, the proposed scheme is evaluated by numerical simulations for theoretical analyses and effectiveness in practice.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=10669763,IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology,2025
Secured Bipartite Consensus Control for Nonlinear Multi-Agent Systems Against Hybrid Attacks: A Component-Based WTOD Protocol,"This article studies the secure bipartite consensus control issue for a nonlinear multi-agent system (MAS) subjected to hybrid attacks. The challenge is to simultaneously consider improving the bandwidth resource utilization of each agent and ensuring secure bipartite consensus. In response to the former, a component-based weighted try-once-discard (WTOD) protocol is proposed, which can save bandwidth resources by selecting the maximum component of each agent’s measurement output instead of only a single agent’s measurement output to transmit to the observer. Different from the previous work, which considered only one single type/channel attack, a unified hybrid attack model is constructed in which aperiodic denial-of-service (DoS) attacks and unknown false data injection (FDI) attacks occur simultaneously in the channels from sensor-to-observer and controller-to-actuator. At this point, a co-estimation strategy is given to estimate the state of agents and the FDI attack signals. Based on this, the observer-based compensation controller is developed to mitigate the impact of FDI attacks based on the feed-forward method. Meanwhile, a set of sufficient conditions is presented to guarantee the existence of such a resilient controller, which can further ensure the underlying system achieves ultimately bounded bipartite consensus. Finally, a simulation example verifies the feasibility and correctness of the proposed method. Note to Practitioners–Nonlinear MASs currently have numerous real-world applications, such as unmanned aerial vehicle formation control and intelligent transportation. Besides the collaborative behavior among agents, antagonistic interactions are also common in the real world. Thus, the research on the bipartite consensus problem would benefit the application of unmanned missions in complex environments. This paper investigates the secure bipartite consensus control problem for a class of nonlinear MAS under hybrid attacks. Notably, these systems are particularly susceptible to various types of cyberattacks. Therefore, it is crucial to mitigate the impact of cyber attacks on nonlinear MAS that rely on communication links for information transmission. To address the challenges posed by simultaneous DoS and FDI attacks occurring in two communication channels, this paper proposes a resilient compensation-based bipartite consensus control scheme for MASs to proactively mitigate the impact of attacks on system performance. Furthermore, a component-based WTOD protocol is proposed to reduce communication resource usage among agents, making the proposed control strategy easier to implement and more user-friendly for control engineers.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=10852388,IEEE Transactions on Automation Science and Engineering,2025
Coprime Factorization-Based Encryption and Attack Detection for Nonlinear Cyber-Physical Systems Using Deep Learning Approach,"This paper presents a data-driven framework for integrating encryption transmission and attack detection in cyber-physical systems (CPS) with nonlinear physical plants. The main focus of this research is to use deep neural networks to realize the coprime factorization (CF) of nonlinear systems. The definition of the CF guides the network training and designing process, and the model’s topology is designed in the state-space form, which improves the interpretability of the data-driven CF. Based on the CF-aided neural networks, an encrypted transmission module is designed that projects information related to system dynamics into a perpendicular data space, which complements existing encryption methods from a control theory perspective. Subsequently, an anomaly detector are designed using the same CF pairs. This detector not only provides high-accuracy detection of attacks but also distinguishes between attacks and faults, thereby reducing the false positive rate and enhancing the reliability of the attack detection. The proposed method has been validated in a real CPS using a mecanum-wheeled vehicle as the physical plant, demonstrating its effectiveness and applicability. Note to Practitioners—Given new security challenges posed by eavesdropping and stealthy attacks in CPS, this paper presents a data-driven framework that integrates encrypted transmission and attack detection for nonlinear CPS based solely on input and output data. The CF-aided neural networks enable an encrypted transmission module that maintains accuracy while projecting system dynamics into a perpendicular data space, which enhances existing encryption from a control theory perspective. Furthermore, the framework includes an attack detection mechanism that effectively differentiates between attacks and system faults, which is rarely considered in existing work. The framework has been validated in a real-world CPS application using a mecanum-wheeled vehicle, showcasing its practical applicability. Its data-driven and model-agnostic design makes it adaptable to various critical CPS applications. For instance, the proposed deep learning-based method shows promise in smart grid systems, effectively addressing complex sensor signal processing challenges. Additionally, the experimental validation provides a foundational reference for extending this methodology to other unmanned vehicle systems. However, implementation may require specific computational resources and deep learning expertise, which could hinder immediate adoption. Further research is needed to explore its scalability across different CPS applications, focusing on optimizing computational efficiency and adapting to domain-specific requirements.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=10949186,IEEE Transactions on Automation Science and Engineering,2025
Air-to-Ground Reconnaissance-Attack Task Allocation for Heterogeneous UAV Swarm,"A task allocation problem for the heterogeneous unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) swarm in unknown environments is studied in this paper. Considering that the actual mission environment information may be unknown, the UAV swarm needs to detect the environment first and then attack the detected targets. The heterogeneity of UAVs, multiple types of tasks, and the dynamic nature of task environment lead to uneven load and time sequence problems. This paper proposes an improved contract net protocol (CNP) based task allocation scheme, which effectively balances the load of UAVs and improves the task efficiency. Firstly, two types of task models are established, including regional reconnaissance tasks and target attack tasks. Secondly, for regional reconnaissance tasks, an improved CNP algorithm using the uncertain contract is developed. Through uncertain contracts, the area size of the regional reconnaissance task is determined adaptively after this task assignment, which can improve reconnaissance efficiency and resource utilization. Thirdly, for target attack tasks, an improved CNP algorithm using the fuzzy integrated evaluation and the double-layer negotiation is presented to enhance collaborative attack efficiency through adjusting the assignment sequence adaptively and multi-layer allocation. Finally, the effectiveness and advantages of the improved method are verified through comparison simulations.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=10937328,Journal of Systems Engineering and Electronics,2025
A Practical Federated Learning Framework With Truthful Incentive in UAV-Assisted Crowdsensing,"The integration of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) and artificial intelligence (AI) has garnered significant interest as a promising paradigm for facilitating intelligent and pervasive mobile crowdsensing (MCS) services. In traditional AI methodologies, the centralization of large volumes of privacy-sensitive sensory data shared by UAVs for model training entails substantial privacy risks. Federated learning (FL) emerges as an appealing privacy-preserving paradigm that enables participating UAVs to collaboratively train shared models while safeguarding the privacy of their data. However, given that the execution of FL tasks inherently requires the consumption of resources such as power and bandwidth, rational and self-interested UAVs may not actively engage in FL or launch free-riding attacks (i.e., sharing fake local models) to mitigate costs. To address the above challenges, we propose a truthful incentive scheme in FL-based UAV-assisted MCS. Specifically, we first present a learning framework tailored for realistic scenarios in UAV-assisted MCS that enhances privacy preservation and optimizes communication efficiency during AI model training for collaborative UAVs, where the sensing platform (i.e., the aggregation server) is the finite-rational decision maker. Then, based on prospect theory (PT), we design an incentive mechanism to motivate UAVs to participate in FL. In this mechanism, a PT-based game is exploited to model the interactions between the sensing platform and UAVs, where the equilibrium is derived. Moreover, we employ a zero-payment mechanism to curb the self-interested behavior of UAVs. Finally, simulation results show that the proposed scheme can facilitate high-quality model sharing while suppressing free-riding attacks.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85207456734&origin=inward,IEEE Transactions on Information Forensics and Security,2025
SOTIF-Oriented Distributed Control for Connected Autonomous Vehicles Platoons,"This article extends the problem of safety of the intended functionality (SOTIF) to the platooning of connected autonomous vehicles (CAVs). In such multivehicle systems, SOTIF objectives are particularly challenging, since new issues arise due to the presence of interactions that propagate and intensify the effects and the risk connected to faults/failures/uncertainties, triggered by any platoon member and external conditions. To tackle and solve the SOTIF-oriented platoon control problem, we propose a robust and resilient decentralized control protocol, based on distributed observer which exploits the information shared via the Vehicle-to-Everything (V2X) communication network. The approach allows maintaining acceptable SOTIF performance in adversarial conditions, mitigating the effects of the unreasonable risks originated from sensors/actuators performance limitations/faults and disturbances. The uniformly ultimate bounded (UUB) stability and the input-to-state string stability (ISSS) of the platoon dynamics are analytically proved via the Lyapunov theory. Feasible linear matrix inequalities (LMIs) are obtained as stability conditions, whose solution allows adapting the distributed control/observer gains according to leader-tracking performance and robustness margins. A detailed analysis via the vehicular co-simulation platform mixed traffic simulator (MiTraS) corroborates the theoretical derivations and shows the achievement of the SOTIF platoon goals for a set of nontrivial and uncertain driving scenarios.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=10892260,"IEEE Transactions on Systems, Man, and Cybernetics: Systems",2025
A Bayesian Optimization Method for Finding the Worst-Case Scenarios of Autonomous Vehicles,"Scenario-based testing has become a crucial method for certifying the safety of autonomous vehicles amidst the rapid advancement of autonomous driving technology. The exploration of worst-case scenarios, which plays a vital role in safety assessments and accelerated improvements of autonomous driving systems, has posed challenges due to the high dimensionality of parameters and the uncertainty of the decisions of autonomous driving systems. To address these challenges, a Bayesian optimization framework was proposed herein as a solution. Surrogate models, including two Gaussian process-based and five non-Gaussian process-based models, are employed to replace part of the costly simulation models, to overcome the challenge of high dimensionality. The Jackknife and Bootstrap methods are used to estimate variance and calculate the acquisition function. Additionally, a differential evolutionary algorithm is employed to achieve efficient solutions while balancing exploration and exploitation, to overcome the challenge of output uncertainty. The proposed framework is validated through experimental results. It successfully identifies the worst-case scenarios in all three cases and the average number of tests for the optimal model in the most complex 9-dimensional scenario is less than 400. Notably, the approach using the Random Forest (RF) surrogate model achieves the highest search success rate in all three cases.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=10759101,IEEE Transactions on Intelligent Transportation Systems,2025
Communication Security and Stability in NNCSs: Realistic DoS Attacks Model and ISTA-Supervised Adaptive Event-Triggered Controller Design,"This article addresses the challenge of achieving asymptotic stability in nonlinear networked control systems (NNCSs) amid denial-of-service (DoS) attacks, particularly under constrained communication resources. We begin by establishing a practical DoS attack model using the NSL-KDD dataset, which provides a realistic depiction of DoS attack dynamics based on real-world data. We then introduce the iterative shrinkage-thresholding algorithm (ISTA) to supervise the adaptive event-triggered controller (AETC), ensuring that system parameters are adjusted effectively while conserving communication resources. We develop an enhanced data compression mechanism to further mitigate the impact of DoS attacks on communication servers. Additionally, we construct an asymmetric Lyapunov-Krasovskii function (LKF) to rigorously verify the asymptotic stability of NNCSs. Finally, we empirically validate the effectiveness of our proposed AETC using an autonomous vehicle (AV) model.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=10772654,IEEE Transactions on Cybernetics,2025
Visual Servoing-Based Anti-Swing Control of Cable-Suspended Aerial Transportation Systems With Variable-Length Cable,"By utilizing a suspension cable to connect the payload with the quadrotor, transport tasks can be accomplished while preserving the unmanned aerial vehicle’s agility and maneuverability, particularly in environments that are impassable for ground vehicles. Equipping onboard visual sensors and utilizing image-based visual servoing techniques, the application range of aerial transportation systems is poised to be significantly expanded in scenarios like autonomous landing and goods release. Unfortunately, within the system, there exist multiple layers of dynamic couplings between image features, quadrotor rotation, translation, and payload motion. These intricacies give rise to numerous difficulties in achieving smooth anti-swing transportation. To overcome the aforementioned difficulties, this paper presents the first image-based visual servoing control scheme for the aerial transportation system with variable-length cable. Specifically, the image moments defined on the rotated virtual image plane are taken as the image features, whose dynamics is independent of the quadrotor rotational motion. Subsequently, a generalized virtual image feature signal is introduced by organically combining the cable length and payload swing angles with the image feature, which is further exploited in the anti-swing control scheme design. The equilibrium point of the overall closed-loop system is proved to be asymptotically stable through Lyapunov techniques and LaSalle’s Invariance Theorem. Hardware experiments are conducted on a self-built aerial transportation platform to verify the proposed controller’s basic and functional performance in terms of rapid anti-swing and accurate target position and cable length tracking. Note to Practitioners—This paper is motivated by the requirement to improve the autonomy level and payload swing suppression ability of the aerial transportation system through visual servoing techniques. By installing onboard monocular camera and the cable length adjustment mechanism, the application scope of the aerial transportation system can be significantly expanded. However, due to the “double” underactuated characteristic, the visual features couple with both the quadrotor motion and the payload motion, hence, it is quite challenging to realize visual servoing control for cable-suspended aerial transportation systems with simultaneous payload swing suppression and quadrotor positioning. Accounting for the foregoing problems, this paper proposes an image-based visual servoing anti-swing control scheme. With the elaborately constructed generalized virtual image feature signal, the designed controller could improve the anti-swing ability with a completed theoretical analysis. Furthermore, two groups of hardware experiments are conducted to validate the effectiveness of the suggested control method. In future studies, we intend to design more effective control scheme for payload delivery issue with consideration of the visibility of the mobile platform.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=10620439,IEEE Transactions on Automation Science and Engineering,2025
3-D Point Cloud Object Completion via RGB Images With Complex Geometric Topology in Urban Scenes,"The increasing deployment of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) as mobile communication relays in urban environments necessitates accurate 3-D modeling of complex urban areas for optimal communication. Current practices involve LiDAR-based 3-D scanning to generate point cloud data; however, sensor limitations and adverse weather conditions may compromise data quality. This study proposes a new multimodal point cloud and image fusion completion network (PIFC-Net) based on a generative adversarial network (GAN), specifically tailored for large-scale urban environments. The experimental study tested five different building shapes and various objects, and the results commend the network for its effectiveness in enhancing the quality and efficiency of point cloud completion.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85208395310&origin=inward,IEEE Geoscience and Remote Sensing Letters,2025
Adaptive Fuzzy Resilient Fixed-Time Bipartite Consensus Tracking Control for Nonlinear MASs Under Sensor Deception Attacks,"This paper studies the adaptive fuzzy resilient fixed-time bipartite consensus tracking control problem for a class of nonlinear multi-agent systems (MASs) under sensor deception attacks. Firstly, in order to reduce the impact of unknown sensor deception attacks on the nonlinear MASs, a novel coordinate transformation technique is proposed, which is composed of the states after being attacked. Then, in the case of unbalanced directed topological graph, a partition algorithm (PA) is utilized to implement the bipartite consensus tracking control, which is more widely applicable than the previous control strategies that only apply to balanced directed topological graph. Moreover, the fixed-time control strategy is extended to nonlinear MASs under sensor deception attacks, and the singularity problem that exists in fixed-time control is successfully avoided by employing a novel switching function. The developed distributed adaptive resilient fixed-time control strategy ensures that all the signals in the closed-loop system are bounded and the bipartite consensus tracking control is achieved in fixed time. Finally, the designed control strategy’s validity is demonstrated by means of a simulation experiment. Note to Practitioners—Currently, there are many practical application scenarios for nonlinear MASs, such as intelligent transportation, unmanned aerial vehicle cluster formation, etc. This paper investigates the adaptive fuzzy resilient fixed-time bipartite consensus tracking control problem for a class of nonlinear MASs under sensor deception attacks. In practice, these two situations are common: 1) The topology graph describing the communication relationship of nonlinear MASs is unbalanced 2) The nonlinear MASs is subjected to external malicious cyber attacks. Therefore, a novel coordinate transformation technique is proposed to reduce the impact of sensor deception attacks on the nonlinear MASs, and a partition algorithm is employed to implement bipartite consensus tracking control based on the unbalanced communication topology graph. At the same time, the nonsingular fixed-time control strategy can significantly improve the convergence of the studied nonlinear MASs. Furthermore, the nonlinear nonstrict-feedback model and backstepping design method used in this paper are general and practical.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=10485233,IEEE Transactions on Automation Science and Engineering,2025
Dynamic Event-Triggered Fuzzy Control of Networked Unmanned Surface Vehicles Under Hybrid Cyber Attacks,"In the realm of networked control systems for unmanned surface vehicles (USVs), guaranteeing the precise positioning and stable control of USVs against cyber attacks has become a critical concern. This work investigates the networked motion control system of an USV under hybrid network attack. We propose a dynamic event triggering control mechanism to resist aperiodic DoS and random FDI attacks, ensuring the optimal utilisation of communication resources. Subsequently, a novel controller design strategy is introduced to ensure the exponential stability of the system in the face of complex network attacks by establishing the T-S fuzzy model of the USV and combining Lyapunov function theory with the linear matrix inequality method. Extensive simulations and experiments on the performance of the control system indicate that our dynamic event triggering control mechanism can effectively cope with both single network attacks and mixed network attacks. These analyses confirm the practicality of the method, reveal the possibility and challenge of maintaining system stability in the real complex attack environment.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85210972567&origin=inward,IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics,2025
Lane Change Prediction for Autonomous Driving With Transferred Trajectory Interaction,"In mixed-autonomy traffic environments, accurately predicting the lane change behavior of human-driven vehicles is critical for ensuring the safety and reliability of autonomous vehicle decision-making. However, existing approaches face two major challenges: 1) they tend to represent the relationships between the target vehicle and surrounding vehicles using parameters like relative position and speed. This approach either requires a fixed number of surrounding vehicles or introduces significant noise by relying on virtual vehicles; and 2) they often fail to fully exploit the vast amount of available vehicle trajectory data, leaving the complexities of vehicular interactions underexplored. To address these issues, this paper presents a novel lane change prediction framework using Transformer-based transfer learning. Our design aims to leverage inter-vehicle interactions learned from trajectory data to improve lane-change prediction accuracy. Specifically, pre-trained trajectory prediction models are used to adapt dynamically to the varying number of surrounding vehicles and to capture interaction context from large sets of trajectory data. We then refine the Transformer model to integrate this context and predict the target vehicle’s lane change intentions. The Transformer encoder transforms trajectory interaction context into a lane-change-oriented context using aggregated multi-head attention. The Transformer decoder, in turn, utilizes this context alongside the target vehicle’s states through relation-aware multi-head attention to forecast lane change behavior. Extensive experiments on two real-world datasets demonstrate that our proposed framework outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in both accuracy and robustness.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=10904067,IEEE Transactions on Intelligent Transportation Systems,2025
DL-DRL: A Double-Level Deep Reinforcement Learning Approach for Large-Scale Task Scheduling of Multi-UAV,"Exploiting unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) to execute tasks is gaining growing popularity recently. To address the underlying task scheduling problem, conventional exact and heuristic algorithms encounter challenges such as rapidly increasing computation time and heavy reliance on domain knowledge, particularly when dealing with large-scale problems. The deep reinforcement learning (DRL) based methods that learn useful patterns from massive data demonstrate notable advantages. However, their decision space will become prohibitively huge as the problem scales up, thus deteriorating the computation efficiency. To alleviate this issue, we propose a double-level deep reinforcement learning (DL-DRL) approach based on a divide and conquer framework (DCF), where we decompose the task scheduling of multi-UAV into task allocation and route planning. Particularly, we design an encoder-decoder structured policy network in our upper-level DRL model to allocate the tasks to different UAVs, and we exploit another attention-based policy network in our lower-level DRL model to construct the route for each UAV, with the objective to maximize the total value of executed tasks given the maximum flight distance of the UAV. To effectively train the two models, we design an interactive training strategy (ITS), which includes pre-training, intensive training and alternate training. Experimental results show that our DL-DRL performs favorably against the learning-based and conventional baselines including the OR-Tools, in terms of solution quality and computation efficiency. We also verify the generalization performance of our approach by applying it to larger sizes of up to 1500 tasks and to different flight distances of UAVs. Moreover, we also show via an ablation study that our ITS can help achieve a balance between the performance and training efficiency. Our code is publicly available at https://faculty.csu.edu.cn/guohuawu/zh_CN/zdylm/193832/list/index.htm. Note to Practitioners—Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) are of great practical usage, as they have many real world applications. When a group of UAVs are employed to execute large-scale tasks, a core question is how to scheduling the UAVs, so that they could complete the tasks efficiently. However, it is a computationally hard problem due to the exponentially increasing search space. To solve this problem, we propose a double-level deep reinforcement learning (DL-DRL) approach within a divide-and-conquer framework (DCF), where the upper-level DRL model is responsible for the task allocation, and the lower-level DRL model is responsible for the UAV route planning. To better train the two DRL models who have interplay with each other, we propose a simple yet efficient training strategy, termed interactive training strategy (ITS), which includes pre-training, intensive training and alternate training. The experimental results based on instances of various scales show that our DL-DRL approach outperformed learning-based and conventional baselines, and the designed ITS could strike a good balance between performance and training efficiency. In light of those verified advantages, we believe that our DL-DRL approach has favorable potential to solve the practical task scheduling problem of multi-UAV in real world.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85187270016&origin=inward,IEEE Transactions on Automation Science and Engineering,2025
Semantically Adversarial Scene Generation With Explicit Knowledge Guidance,"Generating adversarial scenes that potentially fail autonomous driving systems provides an effective way to improve their robustness. Extending purely data-driven generative models, recent specialized models satisfy additional controllable requirements such as embedding a traffic sign in a driving scene by manipulating patterns implicitly at the neuron level. In this paper, we introduce a method to incorporate domain knowledge explicitly in the generation process to achieve Semantically Adversarial Generation (SAG). To be consistent with the composition of driving scenes, we first categorize the knowledge into two types, the property of objects and the relationship among objects. We then propose a tree-structured variational auto-encoder (T-VAE) to learn hierarchical scene representation. By imposing semantic rules on the properties of nodes and edges into the tree structure, explicit knowledge integration enables controllable generation. To demonstrate the advantage of structural representation, we construct a synthetic example to illustrate the controllability and explainability of our method in a succinct setting. We further extend to realistic environments for autonomous vehicles, showing that our method efficiently identifies adversarial driving scenes against different state-of-the-art 3D point cloud segmentation models and satisfies the constraints specified as explicit knowledge.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85214821200&origin=inward,IEEE Transactions on Intelligent Transportation Systems,2025
Fault Diagnosis of Labeled Petri Nets Under Attacks Using Integer Linear Programming,"This paper deals with the online fault diagnosis problem of discrete event systems under malicious external attacks. We consider a scenario where an attacker can intercept certain sensor measurements and alter them arbitrarily, potentially causing a diagnoser to malfunction. In the framework of labeled Petri nets, a novel integer linear programming problem is formulated by introducing binary variables to estimate the possible transition sequences of an observation that may have been tampered with by an attacker. The proposed approach makes two main contributions. The first one is that, by specifying two different objective functions to the integer linear programming problem, we can obtain the diagnosis results in the presence of attacks, which classic diagnosers may fail to achieve; the second is computational efficiency. In the absence of attacks, the proposed approach is experimentally verified to have lower computational overhead compared with the existing results that are based on integer linear programming and those using basis markings. Finally, the proposed approach is illustrated through a manufacturing system for assembling brake valves. Note to Practitioners—Fault diagnosis is critical for highly automated systems such as manufacturing systems, power plants and smart grids. Engineers are familiar with various fault diagnosis techniques in their community. However, malicious attacks in a system are not fully considered when performing fault diagnosis. This research elaborates upon a novel approach to fault diagnosis of discrete event systems modeled by labeled Petri nets, which can perform online fault diagnosis both in the presence and absence of attacks. The approach enables faults to be detected even after certain labels are tampered with by an attacker. The proposed diagnostic vehicle is presented in terms of integer linear programming problems, which facilitates its applications to real systems by practitioners.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=105003029778&origin=inward,IEEE Transactions on Automation Science and Engineering,2025
LHADRO: A Robust Control Framework for Autonomous Vehicles Under Cyber-Physical Attacks,"Deep reinforcement learning has demonstrated remarkable performance in autonomous vehicle control. However, the increasing threat of cyber-physical attacks, which can alter sensor information or vehicle dynamics, poses significant challenges to the robustness of these control policies. To address this, we propose LHADRO (Lambda-History Aware Diversity Robust Oracle), a novel framework that models robust control as a two-player game between control policies and cyber-physical attacks. The key contributions of LHADRO are: (1) A lambda-history aware mechanism that balances past and present meta-policies to enhance training efficiency and mitigates meta-policy thrashing, and (2) A joint diversity introduction mechanism that improves robust control performance by increasing population disparity through a regularization term in parameter updates. We validate the proposed method in MetaDrive-based environments. Experiment results verify that the LHADRO framework improves the robust control performance, and the effectiveness of some critical factors is investigated and discussed.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=10752542,IEEE Transactions on Information Forensics and Security,2025
Risk-Aware Vehicle Trajectory Prediction Under Safety-Critical Scenarios,"Trajectory prediction is significant for intelligent vehicles to achieve high-level autonomous driving, and a lot of relevant research achievements have been made recently. Despite the rapid development, most existing studies solely focus on normal and safe scenarios while largely neglecting safety-critical scenarios, particularly those involving imminent collisions. This oversight may result in autonomous vehicles lacking the essential predictive ability in such situations, posing a significant threat to safety. To tackle these, this paper proposes a risk-aware trajectory prediction framework tailored to safety-critical scenarios. Leveraging distinctive hazardous features, we develop three core risk-aware components. First, we introduce a risk-incorporated scene encoder, which augments conventional encoders with quantitative risk information to achieve risk-aware encoding of hazardous scene contexts. Next, we incorporate endpoint-risk-combined intention queries as prediction priors in the decoder to ensure that the predicted multimodal trajectories cover both various spatial intentions and risk levels. Lastly, an auxiliary risk prediction task is implemented for the ultimate risk-aware prediction. Furthermore, to support model training and performance evaluation, we introduce a safety-critical trajectory prediction dataset and tailored evaluation metrics. We conduct comprehensive evaluations and compare our model with several SOTA models. Results demonstrate the superior performance of our model, with a significant improvement in most metrics. This prediction advancement enables autonomous vehicles to execute correct collision avoidance maneuvers under safety-critical scenarios, eventually enhancing road traffic safety.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=10844066,IEEE Transactions on Intelligent Transportation Systems,2025
Informative Trajectory Planning for Air-Ground Cooperative Monitoring of Spatiotemporal Fields,"This paper investigates an air-ground cooperative monitoring problem for spatiotemporal fields, such as air pollution, forest fires, oil spills, etc, with unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) and unmanned ground vehicles (UGVs). To fully exploit complementarities of these heterogeneous vehicles and improve efficiency of the cooperative monitoring, we design a novel cooperation scheme: each UAV is assigned to loiter over and transmit its observations to a pre-allocated UGV, and the UGV provides guidance on informative trajectories for the UAV and aims to reach a target position as fast as possible. Such a scheme brings challenges to informative trajectory planning of the UGVs, lying in the delayed observations from the UAVs and the cumulative information constraint depending on the unknown field. To overcome them, this work proposes a model-free reinforcement learning (RL)-based trajectory planning method to learn continuous policies for the UGVs, where a field estimator is designed for each UGV to recover observability of the field. In addition, we derive model predictive control (MPC)-based trajectory planners for the UAVs with tailored reference positions, where the uncertain tracking errors can be handled by the RL-based method of the UGVs. Thus, a performance coupling problem of the heterogeneous vehicles is tackled. Simulations illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed trajectory planning methods and the efficiency of the air-ground cooperative monitoring scheme. Note to Practitioners—This article is motivated by cooperative monitoring tasks with UAVs and UGVs in practical applications, such as environmental monitoring, search and rescue after disasters, etc. Due to the complex dynamics of spatiotemporal fields in these tasks, trajectory planning for the cooperative monitoring system is challenging and requires much computations. To resolve the issues, we propose a novel cooperation scheme in this article, where the large computational capability of the UGVs is utilized to solve a minimum-time trajectory planning problem under a cumulative information constraint, and the UAVs only loiter over and transmit measurements about the field to the UGVs. To achieve this scheme, RL-based and MPC-based trajectory planning methods are proposed for the UGVs and the UAVs, respectively. Simulations have validated the effectiveness of the proposed trajectory planning methods and good performance of the cooperative monitoring system.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85190171467&origin=inward,IEEE Transactions on Automation Science and Engineering,2025
Event-Based Probability-Guaranteed Set-Membership Secure Fusion Estimation for Energy-Constrained Multi-Sensor Systems With Asynchronous Samplings,"This paper addresses the problem of designing probability-guaranteed set-membership secure estimation algorithms for energy-constrained multi-sensor systems with multi-rate asynchronous samplings. An event-triggered strategy (ETS) is employed to minimize data transmission overhead while maintaining estimation accuracy by transmitting only essential data. A novel measurement model is proposed to accurately characterize the operation of the multi-sensor system under ETS, taking into account both high- and low-energy transmission (HLET) modes and random denial-of-service (DoS) attacks, which impact communication energy consumption and data security. To cope with the challenges posed by uncertain sampling periods, a new fusion estimation model is established, including a redefined fusion estimation weight matrix and the formulation of a probability-guaranteed set-membership secure fusion estimation algorithm. Furthermore, a recursive optimization algorithm based on linear matrix inequalities is utilized to determine the minimum ellipsoid of the design parameters. The effectiveness of the proposed algorithm is validated through simulation studies. Note to Practitioners—This paper is dedicated to addressing the state estimation problem in practical applications such as autonomous systems, smart grids, and industrial automation. In these fields, ensuring that the true state remains bounded within a certain probability is crucial, especially in applications such as weapon firing tests and drone flights. To meet this need, probability-guaranteed set-membership filtering is introduced, which not only provides state estimation intervals but also ensures that these intervals contain the true state with a certain probability. However, in practical systems, sensor sampling rates are typically asynchronous, which increases the complexity of the design algorithm. Moreover, wireless networks often face bandwidth limitations, and different communication protocols have varying energy consumption, which affect the security and reliability of data transmission. When subjected to cyber-attacks, these varying energy consumption protocols can introduce different security risks, further complicating system performance. Therefore, this paper introduces an ETS to reduce communication load, while designing a fusion estimation algorithm that accounts for both HLET modes and DoS attacks on communication channels. Preliminary simulation results demonstrate the feasibility of the proposed algorithm. Considering the potential complexities such as hybrid attacks, incomplete measurements, and time-delays in real-world systems, future research will focus on improving the interference resilience and robustness of the fusion estimation system, ensuring efficient and accurate state estimation even under harsh conditions.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=10955184,IEEE Transactions on Automation Science and Engineering,2025
Differential Game-Based Deep Reinforcement Learning in Underwater Target Hunting Task,"To meet requirements for real-time trajectory scheduling and distributed coordination, underwater target hunting task is challenging in terms of turbulent ocean environments and dynamic adversarial environment. Despite the existing research in game-based target hunting area, few approaches have considered dynamic environmental factors, such as sea currents, winds, and communication delay. In this article, we focus on a target hunting system consisted of multiple unmanned underwater vehicles (UUVs) and a target with high maneuverability. Besides, differential game theory is leveraged to analyze adversarial behaviors between hunters and the escapee. However, it is intractable that UUVs have to deploy an adaptive scheme to guarantee the consistency and avoid the escape of the target without collision. Therefore, we conceive the Hamiltonian function with Leibniz’s formula to obtain feedback control policies. In addition, it proves that the target hunting system is asymptotically stable in the mean, and the system can satisfy Nash equilibrium relying on the proposed control policies. Furthermore, we design a modified multiagent reinforcement learning (MARL) to facilitate the underwater target hunting task under the constraints of energetic flows and acoustic propagation delay. Simulation results show that the proposed scheme is superior to the typical MARL algorithm in terms of reward and success rate.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=10298247,IEEE Transactions on Neural Networks and Learning Systems,2025
Secure Containment Control for Multi-UAV Systems by Fixed-Time Convergent Reinforcement Learning,"This article concerns the secure containment control problem for multiple autonomous aerial vehicles. The cyber attacker can manipulate control commands, resulting in containment failure in the position loop. Within a zero-sum graphical game framework, secure containment controllers and malicious attackers are regarded as game players, and the attack-defense process is recast as a min-max optimization problem. Acquiring optimal distributed secure control policies requires solving the game-related Hamilton-Jacobi–Isaacs (HJI) equations. Based on the critic-only neural network (NN) structure, the reinforcement learning (RL) method is employed in solving coupled HJI equations. The fixed-time convergence technique is introduced to improve the convergence rate of RL, and the experience replay mechanism is utilized to relax the persistence of excitation condition. The associated NN convergence and closed-loop stability are analyzed. In the attitude loop, the optimal feedback control law is obtained by solving Hamilton-Jacobi–Bellman equations using the fixed-time convergent RL method. The simulation example and the quadrotor experiment are given to show the effectiveness of the proposed scheme.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=10880467,IEEE Transactions on Cybernetics,2025
A Radar System With Adaptive Waveform Selection Against Dynamic Spoofing Attacks,"With the spread of automotive radar systems, spoofing among the frequency-modulated continuous-wave (FMCW) millimeter-wave (mmWave) radars in autonomous vehicles (AVs) is becoming a severe issue. In this work, a dynamic spoofing attack scenario in the real world is constructed based on the fact that spoofing is a minority situation. Since conventional radars miss genuine targets in a spoofing environment and antispoofing radars perform far worse than conventional radars without spoofing, the separate application of both radars in our proposed scenario does not yield satisfactory results. To resolve this issue, we propose a cognitive radar system with adaptive waveform selection against spoofing attacks. First, an authentication mechanism and a quantitative model are constructed to detect malicious attacks, a process to be considered essentially adaptive cognition. Second, the appropriate waveform to be emitted is selected based on the results of the adaptive cognition module. To resist spoofing, we propose a waveform with joint frequency-phase modulation (JFPM) combining frequency hopping and phase coding. Based on the location of the frequency hopping, we categorize it into two schemes: intrachirp JFPM and interchirp JFPM. Finally, simulations and experiments demonstrate that our proposed system can accomplish target detection with relatively high accuracy in our scenario.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=10755168,IEEE Transactions on Aerospace and Electronic Systems,2025
A Platoon-Based Approach for AGV Scheduling and Trajectory Planning in Fully Automated Production Systems,"This article explores the management of automated guided vehicles within smart manufacturing systems, presenting an architecture designed to handle various stages in a fully automated production system. Trajectory planning is managed using a potential field controller, coupled with a time-of-arrival optimization for vehicles heading to shared resources, exploiting the concepts of virtual platoons. This approach optimizes arrival times at resources and minimizes energy consumption, prioritizing other elements directed toward currently available resources within the system. In addition, a decision-making algorithm schedules vehicles needing recharging due to low battery levels, ensuring uninterrupted production without overloading recharging stations and guaranteeing system efficiency. The proposed architecture is tested on three production orders of increasing complexity. Results demonstrate that the use of virtual platooning simplifies the dynamic trajectory generation of the potential field controller and, consequently, significantly reduces energy consumption and waiting times at shared resources, while reducing the variability on the production chain's makespan.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85207428394&origin=inward,IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics,2025
An Accountable GAKA Protocol With Changeable Thresholds and Verifiable Shares in UAVs-Assisted IoVs for Emergency Rescue,"Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) equipped with high line-of-sight communications have been explored as a complement to emergency communication vehicles (ECVs), particularly when ground Internet of Vehicles (IoVs) is dysfunctional resulting from natural disasters. To protect the communication security and integrity of this air-ground integrated networks created in an untrusted and open wireless environment, authentication and key agreement (AKA) is an essential mechanism to establish a secure communication channel by negotiating a session key. Nonetheless, general AKA protocols are typically not ideal for time-sensitive and computing-intensive UAVs-assisted IoVs emergency rescue, in that they are unable to simultaneously satisfy efficiency and key security requirements including accountability, resilience, thresholds changeability, shares verifiability, group adaptability, and key update. To address this challenge, this paper proposes an accountable group authentication and key agreement (GAKA) protocol with changeable thresholds and verifiable shares supporting adaptive group memberships and updatable keys (i.e. SecER). To safeguard accurate rescue decisions for ground ECVs enabled by reliable collaboration among multiple UAVs, we propose a pseudonym mechanism that aims to provide accountability for UAVs. To achieve resilience and thresholds changeability, our SecER utilizes secret sharing coupled with random parameters to seamlessly transform our GAKA protocol into one running with a new threshold in one round (i.e. round-optimal), rather than two rounds. Finally, verifiable parameters and updatable keys are respectively applied to counter deception attacks caused by maliciously distributed shares and to support adaptive network topology (i.e. UAVs joining and leaving). Extensive simulations show that compared to the state-of-the-art approaches, our SecER is superior in balancing security and efficiency.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=10856809,IEEE Transactions on Intelligent Transportation Systems,2025
Noncooperative Formation Tracking of UAVs Against Multiple Cyber-Threats: A Twin-Network Approach,"In this article, we investigate the problem of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) formation tracking in the presence of multiple cyber-threats. In this scenario, UAVs have private, potentially conflicting objectives, and their communication networks and local feedback mechanisms are vulnerable to sabotage and eavesdropping by malicious attackers. To address this real-world challenge, we propose a control scheme based on a twin-network structure. Specifically, we construct a virtual twin layer interconnected with the physical layer to design a resilient estimator that fortifies information exchange among UAVs under threats. In addition, by coupling the states from the twin layer and time-varying signals as masks, we achieve privacy protection for critical information. Furthermore, leveraging reliable data provided by the resilient estimator, we design a cooperative controller based on gradient-optimization to update the UAVs' positions. Using Lyapunov theory, we prove that the position of all UAVs converge to a dynamic Nash equilibrium. Finally, we conduct experimental studies to validate the effectiveness of the proposed control scheme.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=10791329,IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics,2025
Noise Aware Path Planning and Power Management of Hybrid Fuel UAVs,"Hybrid fuel Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAV), through their combination of multiple energy sources, offer several advantages over the standard single fuel source configuration, the primary one being increased range and efficiency. Multiple power or fuel sources also allow the distinct pitfalls of each source to be mitigated while exploiting the advantages within the mission or path planning. We consider here a UAV equipped with a combustion engine-generator and battery pack as energy sources. We consider the path planning and power-management of this platform in a noise-aware manner. To solve the path planning problem, we first present the Mixed Integer Linear Program (MILP) formulation of the problem. We then present and analyze a label-correcting algorithm, for which a pseudo-polynomial running time is proven. Results of extensive numerical testing are presented which analyze the performance and scalability of the labeling algorithm for various graph structures, problem parameters, and search heuristics. It is shown that the algorithm can solve instances on graphs as large as twenty thousand nodes in only a few seconds. Note to Practitioners—The problem and algorithms proposed in this paper are relevant to constrained planning problems in general and specifically to those focused on widespread usage of small aerial vehicles in congested, urban environments. We are concerned here with the path planning of hybrid-fuel aerial vehicles in a noise-aware manner. This is motivated by the increasing usage of aerial vehicles, envisioning a probable future restriction on noise production in certain airspaces and the planning of such vehicles in those airspaces. We explore this novel problem, and present an approach to quickly find the optimal path and power plan in the presence of the noise constraints. The approach here is a discrete one, where the solution is a discrete set of edges and discrete generator settings which must be smoothed to obtain control inputs for a real system. The discrete approach allows solutions to be found quickly while giving up the true optimal trajectory that can be found when considering from a continuous framework. In practice, environment sampling and graph construction will greatly affect time-to-solve and as overall solution quality relative to a continuous approach to the trajectory and generator control.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=105001587720&origin=inward,IEEE Transactions on Automation Science and Engineering,2025
Multi-Agent Generative Adversarial Interactive Self-Imitation Learning for AUV Formation Control and Obstacle Avoidance,"Multiple autonomous underwater vehicles (multi-AUVs) can cooperatively accomplish tasks that a single AUV cannot complete. Recently, multi-agent reinforcement learning has been introduced to control of multi-AUV. However, designing efficient reward functions for various tasks of multi-AUV control is difficult or even impractical. Multi-agent generative adversarial imitation learning (MAGAIL) allows multi-AUV to learn from expert demonstration instead of pre-defined reward functions, but suffers from the deficiency of requiring optimal demonstrations and not surpassing provided expert demonstrations. This letter builds upon the MAGAIL algorithm by proposing multi-agent generative adversarial interactive self-imitation learning (MAGAISIL), which can facilitate AUVs to learn policies by gradually replacing the provided sub-optimal demonstrations with self-generated good trajectories selected by a human trainer. Our experimental results in three multi-AUV formation control and obstacle avoidance tasks on the Gazebo platform with AUV simulator of our lab show that AUVs trained via MAGAISIL can surpass the provided sub-optimal expert demonstrations and reach a performance close to or even better than MAGAIL with optimal demonstrations. Further results indicate that AUVs' policies trained via MAGAISIL can adapt to complex and different tasks as well as MAGAIL learning from optimal demonstrations.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=10924397,IEEE Robotics and Automation Letters,2025
Adaptive Fault-Tolerant Optimized Platoon Cloud Tracking Control for Heterogeneous Vehicles via Dual Learning Mechanism,"This work investigates an adaptive fault-tolerant cloud tracking control scheme for heterogeneous vehicular platoon systems (HVPSs) based on a dual learning mechanism (DLM). A human-vehicle-road-cloud traffic scenario is built, in which the cloud control platform operates HVPSs by sending the command signal to a non-autonomous leader vehicle, which generates the required trajectory. Moreover, a DLM consisting of an improved reinforcement learning mechanism and a composite learning mechanism is proposed to optimize the control performance of the entire vehicular platoon. Furthermore, unlike existing fault-tolerant control methods, the proposed DLM can effectively reduce the adverse effects caused by actuator fault. Via the DLM, and cloud control platform, an adaptive fault-tolerant optimized platoon technology is developed to guarantee the bistability. Finally, simulation results certify the effectiveness and superiority of the developed strategy.Note to Practitioners—This paper is inspired by the problem of vehicular platoon control, but the proposed approach is not only applicable to transportation systems, but also to a variety of scenarios such as smart grids, supply chain management, and fire rescue. The intelligent transportation system aims to realize V2P, V2V, and V2I. However, there still exist several problems, such as the lack of obstacle avoidance/collision mechanism, the occurrence of platoon actuator fault, and the excessive consumption of vehicle energy, making it difficult to apply in complex traffic. In this paper, the proposed method can effectively solve the above problems, and simulation experiments have shown that this method is feasible and superior. However, vehicular platoon path programming and external network attacks have not yet been considered. To approach the real traffic environment more closely also prompts us to conduct research in the future.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85196121013&origin=inward,IEEE Transactions on Automation Science and Engineering,2025
Toward Crash-Free Autonomous Driving: Anomaly Detection and Control for Resilience to Stealthy Sensor Attacks,"Cooperative adaptive cruise control (CACC) enables connected and automated vehicles (CAVs) to drive autonomously on the highway in closely coupled platoons. The use of CACC technologies increases safety and the traffic throughput, and decreases fuel consumption and CO2 emissions. However, CAVs heavily rely on embedded software, hardware, and communication networks that make them vulnerable to a range of cyberattacks. Cyberattacks to a particular CAV compromise the entire platoon as CACC schemes propagate corrupted data to neighboring vehicles potentially leading to traffic delays and collisions. Physics-based monitors can be used to detect the presence of false data injection (FDI) attacks to CAV sensors; however, given enough system knowledge, adversaries are still able to launch a range of attacks that can surpass the detection scheme by hiding within the system disturbances and uncertainty—we refer to this class of attacks as stealthy FDI attacks. Stealthy attacks are hard to deal with as they affect the platoon dynamics without being noticed. In this manuscript, we propose a design methodology (built around a series convex programs) to synthesize distributed attack monitors and  $H_{\infty }$  CACC controllers that minimize the joint effect of stealthy FDI attacks and system disturbances on the platoon dynamics while guaranteeing a prescribed platooning performance. Computer simulations are provided to illustrate the performance of our tools.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85205141293&origin=inward,IEEE Internet of Things Journal,2025
Forward Completeness in Open Sets and Applications to Control of Automated Vehicles,"Forward complete systems are guaranteed to have solutions that exist globally for all positive time. In this article, a relaxed Lyapunov-like condition for forward completeness is presented for finite-dimensional systems defined on open sets that does not require boundedness of the Lyapunov-like function along the solutions of the system but an exponential growth condition. The corresponding condition is then exploited for the design of autonomous 2-D movement, with focus on lane-free cruise controllers for automated vehicles described by the bicycle kinematic model. The derived feedback laws (cruise controllers) are decentralized and can account for collision avoidance, roads of variable width, on-ramps and off-ramps as well as different desired speed for each vehicle.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=105001870915&origin=inward,IEEE Transactions on Automatic Control,2025

The main ideas behind the framework are twofold: 1) Leverage content attributes to ensure freshness of cached contents, and 2) Exploit inter-vehicle attributes to enhance the stability of dissemination paths where fresh contents are pushed and pulled, achieving rapid access to contents. According to the experimental results, the fresh content access latency and cost are reduced by nearly 21.41% and 26.18%, and the success rate is improved by nearly 7.9%.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85208707656&origin=inward,IEEE Transactions on Intelligent Transportation Systems,2025
GPS Spoofing Attack Recognition for UAVs With Limited Samples,"As a malicious attack targeting on the GPS receiver, GPS spoofing attack interferes the normal received satellite signal by reproducing or relaying the signal, resulting in severe position deviation. Such attack has posed significant security threat to unmanned-aerial-vehicles (UAVs), especially in the era of low-altitude economics. However, due to the similarity of the spoofing and intended signal, and the presence of noise, accurate detection and recognition of GPS spoofing attack still remains a challenging issue, particularly in the case of limited samples. In this article, we apply the AdaBoost-CNN algorithm, which combines multiple weak convolutional neural network (CNN) classifiers into a strong classification model, to achieve GPS spoofing attack recognition. To further improve the recognition accuracy when there are very limited samples, we improve the AdaBoost-CNN algorithm by transferring previous network parameters to subsequent CNN. Both simulated and real measurement data are employed to verify the effectiveness of the proposed scheme. It is shown that the recognition accuracy can reach up to 93.75% and 95.83% with 160 simulated samples and 120 measured samples, respectively.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=86000384690&origin=inward,IEEE Internet of Things Journal,2025
RaI-SLAM: Radar-Inertial SLAM for Autonomous Vehicles,"Simultaneous localization and mapping are essential components for the operation of autonomous vehicles in unknown environments. While localization focuses on estimating the vehicle's pose, mapping captures the surrounding environment to enhance future localization and decision-making. Localization is commonly achieved using external GNSS systems combined with inertial measurement units, LiDARs, and/or cameras. Automotive radars offer an attractive onboard sensing alternative due to their robustness to adverse weather and low lighting conditions, compactness, affordability, and widespread integration into consumer vehicles. However, they output comparably sparse and noisy point clouds that are challenging for pose estimation, easily leading to noisy trajectory estimates. We propose a modular approach that performs radar-inertial SLAM by fully leveraging the characteristics of automotive consumer-vehicle radar sensors. Our system achieves smooth and accurate onboard simultaneous localization and mapping by combining automotive radars with an IMU and exploiting the additional velocity and radar cross-section information provided by radar sensors, without relying on GNSS data. Specifically, radar scan-matching and IMU measurements are first incorporated into a local pose graph for odometry estimation. We then correct the accumulated drift through a global pose graph backend that optimizes detected loop closures. Contrary to existing radar SLAM methods, our graph-based approach is divided into distinct submodules and all components are designed specifically to exploit the characteristics of automotive radar sensors for scan matching and loop closure detection, leading to enhanced system performance. Our method achieves state-of-the-art accuracy on public autonomous driving data.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=10947322,IEEE Robotics and Automation Letters,2025
Probability-Guaranteed Distributed Set-Membership Secure Fusion Estimation Against Nonlinear Hybrid Attacks,"This paper investigates the distributed secure fusion estimation problem under stochastic nonlinear hybrid attacks. Specifically, this work analyzes a hybrid attack scenario where the attacker employs a randomized approach to launch false data injection (FDI) attacks and Denial-of-Service (DoS) attacks on the measurement information communication channel. Then, an innovative distributed secure fusion estimation model is proposed, addressing three situations: DoS attacks, FDI attacks, and the absence of attacks. Following this, an existence condition is derived for the secure fusion estimator, utilizing probability-guaranteed set-membership filtering technology, to ensure that the fusion estimation error will consistently be bounded within an expected ellipsoid with the specified probability. Subsequently, a convex optimization problem involving constrained recursive matrix inequalities is formulated to compute the secure fusion estimation weight matrices. Finally, the effectiveness of the proposed probability-guaranteed set-membership secure fusion estimation (SSFE) algorithm is demonstrated through a simulation example. Note to Practitioners—The research in this paper is dedicated to addressing the problem of fusion state estimation in practical engineering tasks such as intelligent transportation, industrial manufacturing and military defense. With the increase in application requirements and process accuracy, the majority of projects demand that the true state must be bounded within a certain range, e.g., unmanned vehicle obstacle avoidance and missile precision strikes. To overcome this challenge, probability-guaranteed set-membership filtering is introduced to ensure that the fusion estimation error is bounded with a certain probability. However, due to the expanding scope of engineering applications, the system may be deployed to perform tasks in a non-secure environment, which increases the risk of malicious attacks that may lead to functional failures as well as performance degradation. Therefore, this paper simultaneously considers the scenario where the communication channels are subjected to the stochastic hybrid attacks, which can be effectively handled by utilizing the proposed probability-guaranteed SSFE algorithm. Preliminary simulations demonstrate the feasibility of the algorithm. Since the actual system may also encounter problems such as sensor energy constraints, bandwidth resource limitations, and data processing asynchrony. Therefore, in our future work, we will focus on addressing the various limitations present in the fusion estimation system and improving their resolution.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=10589589,IEEE Transactions on Automation Science and Engineering,2025
Adaptive Fractional-Order Fault-Tolerant Coordinated Tracking Control of Heterogeneous Multiagent Systems Against Multiple Faults Under Deception Attacks,"This article addresses the issue of the adaptive fractional-order fault-tolerant coordinated tracking control (FO-FTCTC) for multiple unmanned aerial vehicles and unmanned ground vehicles with fixed-time prescribed performance subjected to actuator and sensor faults under deception attacks. Deception attacks disrupt the sensor network, making the output and state unavailable. To achieve the tracking control of the system, the coordinate transformation method is developed, in which the attack gains are considered and the compromised states are utilized to design a control scheme. Then, the fixed-time prescribed performance function (PPF) is illustrated to transform the coordinated tracking errors (CTEs) into another error variable so that the unconventional errors are limited to the prescribed range. Next, the sliding-mode surface is built by utilizing the errors and fractional calculus. In addition, the radial basis function neural network is utilized to deal with the unknown term. Based on the error, the adaptive FO-FTCTC scheme by utilizing the radial basis function neural network (RBFNN), fractional calculus, and fixed-time PPF with prescribed performance can be achieved, which can strengthen the system performance. Based on the Lyapunov function approach, all vehicles can coordinately track their desired references and CTEs can be bounded within the prescribed boundary. Finally, simulation studies are provided to verify the validity of the developed FO-FTCTC scheme.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=105002589058&origin=inward,IEEE Transactions on Aerospace and Electronic Systems,2025
Distributed Estimation and Motion Control in Multi-Agent Systems Under Multiple Attacks,"This paper addresses the problem of distributed estimation and motion control (DEMC) in multi-agent systems (MASs) with both linear and Lipschitz nonlinear dynamics. Unlike conventional DEMC methods designed for MASs under ideal conditions, this work investigates scenarios where all agents are vulnerable to various forms of attacks. The considered attacks comprise false-data injection (FDI) attacks and denial of service (DoS) attacks that affect the communication channels among agents to destabilize the MAS. Also, the unbounded actuator attacks which exist in practical environments to intentionally degrade the MAS performance is considered. To cope with these kinds of attacks, two novel resilient approaches are established aimed at estimating and following a mobile target under attacks. The proposed distributed attack-resilient control strategies are designed based on a dual-layer structure, guaranteeing effective DEMC with an ultimately bounded error. The results from two simulation examples are provided to validate the presented algorithms. Note to Practitioners—The motivation of this work is to deal with the DEMC problem for MASs under multiple attacks. In most of the existing DEMC schemes for MASs, having a healthy network and dynamics is a requirement. However, in practical environments, MASs as an important subclass of cyber-physical systems are subject to different types of attacks that affect the network and dynamics of MASs and may seriously jeopardize the performance of the DEMC algorithm, or even worse, lead to instability. Therefore, a resilient hierarchical DEMC algorithm is proposed for MASs which allows agents to estimate and follow a mobile target under multiple attacks. The proposed scheme is resilient to most existing cyber-attacks and is designed for MASs with both linear and nonlinear dynamics. It can be applied to various practical engineering systems such as autonomous vehicles, mobile robots, and intelligent transportation systems. The stability and convergence of the proposed algorithms are analyzed mathematically, and it is shown that the agents not only track the estimated target but also can cope with multiple attacks through simulation experiments.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=10902452,IEEE Transactions on Automation Science and Engineering,2025
VREM-FL: Mobility-Aware Computation-Scheduling Co-Design for Vehicular Federated Learning,"Assisted and autonomous driving are rapidly gaining momentum and will soon become a reality. Artificial intelligence and machine learning are regarded as key enablers thanks to the massive amount of data that smart vehicles will collect from onboard sensors. Federated learning is one of the most promising techniques for training global machine learning models while preserving data privacy of vehicles and optimizing communications resource usage. In this article, we propose vehicular radio environment map federated learning (VREM-FL), a computation-scheduling co-design for vehicular federated learning that combines mobility of vehicles with 5G radio environment maps. VREM-FL jointly optimizes learning performance of the global model and wisely allocates communication and computation resources. This is achieved by orchestrating local computations at the vehicles in conjunction with transmission of their local models in an adaptive and predictive fashion, by exploiting radio channel maps. The proposed algorithm can be tuned to trade training time for radio resource usage. Experimental results demonstrate that VREM-FL outperforms literature benchmarks for both a linear regression model (learning time reduced by 28%) and a deep neural network for semantic image segmentation (doubling the number of model updates within the same time window).",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85207399246&origin=inward,IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology,2025
Data-Driven Event-Triggered Sliding Mode Secure Control for Autonomous Vehicles Under Actuator Attacks,"This article investigates a comprehensive data-driven event-triggered secure lateral control of autonomous vehicles under actuator attacks. We consider stabilization issues of autonomous vehicles subject to modeling difficulties, limited communication resources, and actuator attacks. The dynamic model decomposition (DMD) from data is exploited to characterize the inherent lateral dynamics model of autonomous vehicles, the event-triggered transmission scheme is utilized to alleviate communication burden for limited bandwidth network, and the sliding mode control scheme is designed to ensure the security of autonomous vehicles under actuator attacks. The stability analysis and the stabilization method as well as its algorithm are presented. The proposed secure control scheme can actively counteract the malicious effects caused by actuator attacks and integrates the advantages of both data-driven modeling and model-based control design.

Attack-Resistant Sliding Mode Control for Markov Jump Systems With Redundant Channels: A Novel Two-Layer Mapping approach,"A security control problem is addressed for a kind of networked Markov jump system subject to two-side stochastic denial-of-service (DoS) attacks, in which the attack occurrence situation obeys the Markov chain. To resist the attack effects, a redundant channel protocol is adopted, wherein measurement/control signals are sent to the controller/actuator via the redundant channel when the primary channel suffers from cyber-attacks. According to the above redundant channel protocol, both measurement and input models are established to represent the received signals by the controller and actuator, respectively. Then, a novel two-layer mapping strategy via logical operations is proposed to describe attack occurrences and system jumping. These facilitate the design of a security sliding mode controller, under which the exponential mean-square stability of the networked Markov jump systems subject to DoS attacks and the corresponding sufficient conditions are derived. Eventually, the simulation results via the DC chopper circuit system are provided to illustrate the proposed redundant-channel-based security control method. Note to Practitioners—This paper is motivated by the attack resistance problem in networked control systems. With the revolutionary evolution of wireless communication technology, in many practical systems, such as smart power grids, unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), and unmanned surface vehicles (USVs), the physical devices including sensors, actuators, controllers, and other intelligent devices are interconnected and transmitted the data through a network infrastructure. The inevitable DoS attacks may cause reliability degradation of data transmission, which in practice results in shaky grid frequency, failed UAV formation, and inaccurate USV detection. Distinguished from the previous investigation results from a passive perspective, this paper proposes a redundant-channel-based method to solve the reliability degradation problem caused by DoS attacks from a proactive perspective. The developed redundant channel method against Markov-chain-based DoS attacks can improve the reliability of data transmission, and the proposed novel two-layer mapping strategy via logical operations can increase the freedom of security controller design. A DC chopper circuit is used to verify the effectiveness of the proposed novel control method and comparison simulation results show the advantages of the redundant channel method. How to improve the reliability of vulnerable channels is a knotty problem in communication. With the groundbreaking research of this paper, against other attacks, such as deception attacks, reply attacks, and frequency- and duration-constrained DoS attacks, the attack resistance problems via proactively strengthening the reliability of data transmission should be further explored in the future.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85189291875&origin=inward,IEEE Transactions on Automation Science and Engineering,2025
Lightweight and Adaptive Data-Driven Intrusion Detection System for Autonomous Vehicles,"Autonomous vehicles are equipped with numerous electronic control units (ECUs). These ECUs are interconnected via in-vehicle networks to ensure safety, assist drivers, and perform various functions. A controller area network (CAN) facilitates real-time data transmission between ECUs. CAN provides sufficient reliability for communication within vehicles. Modern vehicles also utilize vehicle-to-everything (V2X) technologies. V2X enables vehicles to link to external networks, facilitating communication with other vehicles, infrastructures, and electronic devices. Modern vehicles’ enhanced functionality and connections make them more susceptible to cyberattacks on both in-vehicle and external networks because of their extensive attack surfaces. To address this issue, this research presents a novel data-driven intrusion detection system (IDS) designed for in-vehicle and external communication networks. The proposed IDS can effectively detect many types of intrusions beyond the constraints of binary classifications. This system underwent a comprehensive evaluation using three in-vehicle datasets: car-hacking, car-hacking: attack & defense Challenge, and the ROAD datasets. Additionally, it was evaluated on two external communication network datasets: CICIDS2017 and CSE-CIC-IDS2018. The evaluation results demonstrated the IDS’s adaptability, achieving significant accuracy, recall, and F1 scores. It attained up to 99.99% accuracy with the in-vehicle datasets. Moreover, it exhibited an exceptionally low false-positive rate, as low as 0, in the Car-Hacking dataset. The proposed IDS architecture is a lightweight approach compared to state-of-the-art models. It significantly reduced complexity in terms of Floating-Point Operations per Second (FLOPs), memory usage, and learning parameters, all without compromising performance.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85212052725&origin=inward,IEEE Transactions on Intelligent Transportation Systems,2025
Kite-Inspired Deadlock-Free Deploying for UAV Swarm-to-Swarm in GNSS-Denied Environment,"In a global navigation satellite system (GNSS) denied environment, unmanned-aerial-vehicle (UAV) clusters and adversarial targets do not have precise positional information. In contrast, targets keep high mobility and try to hide from surveillance. These accumulated complex scenarios can cause difficulty in tracking, monitoring, and attacking (or rescuing) target swarms. To solve these problems, we organize the self-organizing UAV clusters to involve topology construction, routing, communication deployment, and collaborative control. We aim to reduce reliance on control bases and achieve coordinated completion of relevant tasks. We propose a series of task scheduling and UAV deployment strategies to address the dynamic changes of obscured target positions in real scenarios. Meanwhile, to confront poorly understood target swarms, we introduce an UAV network connectivity structure like a kite, which only fixes a single node — “the control base.” Based on the distance between control bases and targets, we propose two modified classical evolution algorithms to search for the optimal solution set to expand the kite-like topology step by step. At the same time, a depth-first search-based unlocking algorithm is designed to unlock the target matrix that satisfies the UAV model constraints while considering a new deadlock scenario of multitarget saturation task scheduling. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed comprehensive multitask scheduling algorithm exhibits good convergence and provides high-efficiency online and offline solutions for deployment.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85202751275&origin=inward,IEEE Internet of Things Journal,2024
Fast 3-D Radio Map Reconstruction via Cross Tensor Approximation,"3-D radio maps provide significantly richer information than their 2-D counterparts in spectrum cartography. However, reconstruction methods for 3-D radio maps remain underexplored. Classic methods, such as spatial interpolation and matrix completion, can be adapted for 3-D scenarios, but they are often computationally intensive and require a substantial number of sampling measurements. To address these challenges, we propose a novel and efficient 3-D radio map reconstruction paradigm inspired by cross tensor approximation (CTA). During the measurement phase, only piecewise straight-line paths are required, making this method well-suited for the flying trajectories of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs). In the reconstruction phase, we utilize the inherent tensor structure of 3-D radio maps by employing the fiber sampling tensor decomposition (FSTD) algorithm, which ensures high-quality and computationally efficient reconstruction from the measurements. To further reduce the number of measurements, we introduce a new algorithm called interpolation-integrated FSTD (II-FSTD). This algorithm builds on the original FSTD yet exploits the smoothness of radio maps to incorporate interpolation, thereby reducing the required measurement frequency. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that the proposed paradigm can reconstruct 3-D radio maps with high quality, using fewer measurements and less computational time compared to state-of-the-art techniques. Notably, in scenarios with lower measurement frequency, II-FSTD outperforms other methods, achieving superior reconstruction performance.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85204396201&origin=inward,IEEE Internet of Things Journal,2024
SpotAttack: Covering Spots on Surface to Attack LiDAR-Based Autonomous Driving Systems,"LiDAR significantly contributes to autonomous driving systems (ADSs) through its perception, prediction and decision layers. Recent research has focused on implementing adversarial attack on LiDAR-based ADS by generating perturbed point cloud adversarial samples. However, most state-of-the-art attacks focus on stationary scenarios, making it difficult to apply them in dynamic scenarios with multiframe point clouds. In this article, we introduce SpotAttack, a novel adversarial attack that targets specific areas of a vehicle’s surface using distributed patches. Unlike traditional adversarial mechanism that mislead the object classification through pixel perturbations, our designed spots decrease the reflectivity of LiDAR rays, causing the point clouds in these patches to be obscured. As a result, the 3-D object detection network will produce incorrect pose estimations based on the adversarial point cloud samples. To ensure the effectiveness of SpotAttack in dynamic scenarios, we establish a position matrix for multiobjective optimization and adopt genetic algorithm (GA) to address the nondifferentiable issue in spots generation. We conduct extensive experiments in three typical scenarios, and the results demonstrate that the proposed attack can manipulate LiDAR perception and influence ADS decision making.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=10663299,IEEE Internet of Things Journal,2024
Exploiting Radio Frequency Characteristics With a Support Unmanned Aerial Vehicle to Improve Wireless Sensor Location Estimation Accuracy,"A lot of the devices in the Internet of Things are sensors responsible for capturing environmental information and relaying it to a system or network. Oftentimes, it is important to know the location of these sensors to better contextualize the information received from them. However, the sensors are purposely simple and cheap, meaning that conventional localization techniques, such as global navigation satellite systems are not feasible. Research has been done on using unmanned aerial vehicles to estimate the location of the sensors, but issues with signal strength fluctuation and location approximation because of it are still prevalent. In this work, we propose a new method for estimating the location of sensors by exploiting the characteristics of radio wave signal propagation and creating a new flight path design, a solution to minimize the impact of variation in measurements, a novel candidate point generation through signal strength analysis, and a method to find the location based on the candidates. Through a thought-out experiment, we show that the proposed algorithm is overall significantly better than the existing solution when it comes to identifying the location of outdoor sensors.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85201759238&origin=inward,IEEE Internet of Things Journal,2024
UAV-Aided Lifelong Learning for AoI and Energy Optimization in Nonstationary IoT Networks,"In this article, a novel joint energy and Age of Information (AoI) optimization framework for Internet of Things (IoT) devices in a nonstationary environment is presented. In particular, IoT devices that are distributed in the real-world are required to efficiently utilize their computing resources so as to balance the freshness of their data and their energy consumption. To optimize the performance of IoT devices in such a dynamic setting, a novel lifelong reinforcement learning (RL) solution that enables IoT devices to continuously adapt their policies to each newly encountered environment is proposed. Given that IoT devices have limited energy and computing resources, an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) is leveraged to visit the IoT devices and update the policy of each device sequentially. As such, the UAV is exploited as a mobile learning agent that can learn a shared knowledge base with a feature base in its training phase, and feature sets of a zero-shot learning method in its testing phase, to generalize between the environments. To optimize the trajectory and flying velocity of the UAV, an actor-critic network is leveraged so as to minimize the UAV energy consumption. Simulation results show that the proposed lifelong RL solution can outperform the state-of-art benchmarks by enhancing the balanced cost of IoT devices by 8.3% when incorporating warm-start policies for unseen environments. In addition, our solution achieves up to 49.38% reduction in terms of energy consumption by the UAV in comparison to the random flying strategy.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=10540053,IEEE Internet of Things Journal,2024
Intelligent Decision-Making Method for AUV Path Planning Against Ocean Current Disturbance via Reinforcement Learning,"With the development of society and the economy, low-carbon and low-energy means of exploiting marine resources are receiving increasing attention. Autonomous path planning is a fundamental capability for IoT autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV) to carry out ocean exploration tasks. Currently, the main issue lies in the numerous disturbances and uncertainties present in the marine environment during practical applications, which can significantly impact path planning, leading to high-energy consumption and carbon emissions. To address this challenge, this article presents a sustainable reinforcement learning algorithm for handling time-varying current disturbances to achieve low-carbon AUV path planning, which is delineated into three steps. First, a 3-D time-varying current environment is established as the environmental framework for reinforcement learning, and the dynamic model of the AUV is formulated. Second, to enhance training efficiency and reduce AUV’s energy consumption, this article puts forth the ocean current disturbance rejection PPO (OCDRP) algorithm, which incorporates tidal current information to enhance the AUV’s resilience to time-varying currents. Lastly, expectile regression methods are introduced to facilitate the algorithm’s convergence. Experimental results confirm the efficacy of the proposed algorithm and its adaptability to time-varying currents, making it an efficient, adaptable, and low-carbon sustainable path planning approach.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=10490109,IEEE Internet of Things Journal,2024
Linear Stability of Heterogeneous Traffic Flow Incorporating V2X Communication and Intraplatoon Spatial Distribution,"This article provides a comprehensive analysis of the effects of connected and automated vehicles (CAVs) market penetration rate, spatial distribution, and V2X communication on the stability of heterogeneous traffic flow. We explore stability variations across different scenarios by developing a car-following model and analyzing stability conditions. Our findings show that increasing CAV market penetration enhances traffic flow stability by expanding the stable speed range and reducing the unstable speed range. Additionally, we investigate the influence of CAV spatial distribution and V2X communication on traffic flow stability. The results reveal that forming CAV platoons reduces intervehicle interference, thus improving stability. Furthermore, V2X communication enhances traffic flow stability by enabling more accurate prediction and control of car-following behaviors. We also examine the impact of cyberattacks on heterogeneous traffic flow, finding that such attacks cause unnecessary accelerations, decelerations, and delays, thereby increasing accident risks. Finally, we acknowledge the study’s limitations and propose future research directions, including nonlinear stability analysis of heterogeneous traffic flow and developing effective control strategies to mitigate the adverse effects of cyberattacks.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=10673975,IEEE Internet of Things Journal,2024

Sum-Rate Maximization for D2D-Enabled UAV Networks With Seamless Coverage Constraint,"This article investigates sum-rate maximization while achieving seamless coverage with the minimum number of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) in a device-to-device (D2D)-enabled UAV network. Toward this end, we formulate it as a nonlinear and nonconvex optimization problem, and then propose a max-rate-min-number (MRMN) scheme to solve this optimization problem. First, we derive UAV’s coverage radius which can depict the maximum coverage for user equipments, and then implement the optimal deployment for UAV swarm by exploiting the disk covering theory. Furthermore, we apply the coalitional game theory to design the cooperative strategy between UAV swarm and ground equipments. Finally, a coalition formation algorithm is presented for achieving maximum system sum-rate while reducing the number of UAVs under seamless coverage constraint. Extensive simulation results are provided to validate the effectiveness of our proposed MRMN scheme, and also illustrate that the scheme can improve the system sum-rate and reduce the number of deployed UAVs. Meanwhile, we further conduct a performance comparison between our scheme and the existing benchmark schemes.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=10664553,IEEE Internet of Things Journal,2024
An Automated Threat Intelligence Framework for Vehicle–Road Cooperation Systems,"Vehicle-road cooperation systems (VRCSs) use next-generation Internet technologies, including 5G, edge computing, and artificial intelligence to improve mobility, comfort, and travel efficiency. Internet of Vehicles (IoV) ecosystem serves as the technological backbone for VRCS by enabling seamless communication and data exchange between vehicles, infrastructure, and traffic management centers. This enables real-time, high-speed communication, efficient data processing, and enhanced security, fostering the development of autonomous driving, smart traffic management, and seamless connectivity within the VRCS ecosystem. At the same time, cyber attacks have become more complex, persistent, organized, and weaponized in IoV network. Threat intelligence (TI) has emerged as a prominent security approach to obtain a complete view of the dynamically growing cyber threat environment. On the other hand, modeling TI is a challenging task due to the limited labels available for different cyber threat sources. Second, most of the available designs require a large investment of resources and use handcrafted features, making the entire process error-prone and time-consuming. To tackle these challenges, this article presents TIMIF, a deep-learning-based TI modeling and identification framework for intelligent IoV and is based on three key modules: first, the proposed TIMIF adopts an automated pattern extractor (APE) module to extract hidden patterns from IoV networks. Employing its output, we design a TI-based detection (TIBD) module to detect abnormal behavior and TI-attack type identification (TIATI) module to identify attack types. Extensive experiments are carried out on three different publicly intrusion data sources, namely, HCRL-car hacking, ToN-IoT, and CICIDS-2017 to illustrate the utility of the TIMIF framework over some commonly used baselines and state-of-the-art techniques.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=10522495,IEEE Internet of Things Journal,2024
An RF-Visual Directional Fusion Framework for Precise UAV Positioning,"Anti-unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) systems are crucial for preventing unauthorized individuals from exploiting UAVs for illegal activities, including surveillance and attacks. Precise real-time positioning of small UAVs is the premise of the effective operation of anti-UAV systems. However, its performance is confined due to the small size of the target and its high susceptibility to disturbance caused by birds or other aircraft. To tackle this problem, a radio-frequency (RF)-visual directional fusion framework is proposed for precise UAV positioning. In the framework, radio signals are aligned with images by jointly calibrating the array antenna and camera. The spatial spectrum is extracted by an array antenna to concentrate on target areas within the image modal. Moreover, in order to improve the precision of joint calibration, a segmentation-based denoising method is proposed to remove the spectrum noise. Furthermore, a practical anti-UAV positioning platform is established, and two synchronized data sets, which include visual images and UAV RF signals, are collected on the platform. Experimental results demonstrate that our proposed framework improves positioning accuracy and robustness compared to the benchmark methods.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=10597658,IEEE Internet of Things Journal,2024
Hybrid Optimal Control for Malware Propagation in UAV-WSN System: A Stacking Ensemble Learning Control Algorithm,"Unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) and wireless sensor network (WSN) system widely used in emergency sites monitoring, disaster relief and data collection, is vulnerable to malware attack. In this article, we establish a novel epidemic model to accurately describe the characteristics of malware cross-propagation and stochastic disturbances between UAV and WSN. To control their spread, the hybrid charging and patching strategies are optimized by the proposed stochastic hybrid optimal control (OC) method while minimizing control costs. An effective stacking ensemble learning control (SELC) approach is developed to obtain a sub-OC strategy.

BAKAS-UAV: A Secure Blockchain-Assisted Authentication and Key Agreement Scheme for Unmanned Aerial Vehicles Networks,"Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs, also known as Drones) have been widely employed in military defense and civilian service. However, as UAVs communicate over insecure open wireless channels, the security challenges and privacy concerns are becoming increasingly prominent. Moreover, some existing schemes to achieve authentication and key agreement (AKA) among UAVs are spliced with the assistance of two UAV-2-GCS mechanisms, which are not flexible enough to be applied in the Internet of Drones (IoD) scenarios. This article proposes a blockchain-assisted AKA scheme for UAVs networks (BAKAS-UAV) referred to as BAKAS-UAV, which addresses security and privacy concerns and overcomes high computational and communication costs in the IoD. A blockchain-based network model is presented in which the ground station acts as an edge node and manages the blockchain, which assists AKA. Based on the network model, both types of AKA mechanisms, UAV-2-GCS and UAV-2-UAV, are proposed, respectively. In particular, the ground control station (GCS) does not participate in the AKA of UAV-2-UAV process; only upon the process is completed the two UAVs synchronize the updated information with GCS. We also implement a smart contract as the authentication service, and the experimental implementation demonstrates the availability of our scheme in IoD. Physical unclonable functions (PUFs) is introduced on the UAVs side to defend against physical capture attacks and also to implement AKA mechanisms. The semantic security is proved formally based on the real-or-random (ROR) model, and the informal analysis shows that the scheme satisfies the demanded security requirements. The scheme’s performance is evaluated by simulating the UAVs and GCS settings with Raspberry Pi 4B and MacOS platforms, respectively, with implementation of several cryptographic primitives. The experimental results show that BAKAS-UAV achieves high efficiency.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85200236436&origin=inward,IEEE Internet of Things Journal,2024
USV Fleet-Assisted Collaborative Data Backup in Marine Internet of Things,"With the rapid development of artificial intelligence technology, unmanned surface vehicles (USVs) in marine Internet of Things (MIoTs) have become an important paradigm for marine environment exploration. However, in MIoTs, when collecting environmental information, USVs face a series of threats, such as engine failure, grounding, collision, etc., resulting in damage to shipboard memory, vessel breakage and sinking, which may cause loss or damage of stored data. The USV fleet consisting of multiple USVs is recently advocated to enable collaborative communication and storage resource sharing. As such, in this article, the USV fleet-assisted data backup scheme for the damaged USVs is proposed to guarantee the availability of stored data. First, a data backup framework for USV fleets is designed, where the USVs are classified into high-risk USVs and low-risk USVs according to the damage risk probability of sailing. Within the USV fleet, high-risk USVs (i.e., requesters) back up data to low-risk USVs (i.e., assistants) during emergency times. Second, the coalition game based on cost sharing is utilized to incentivize individual USVs to form the optimal USV fleets by maximizing the expected revenues, where the cost sharing fashion effectively ensures the stability of the coalitions. Finally, the joint optimization problem of the requesters’ allocating data decisions and the assistants’ receiving data decisions is formulated to maximize the average amount of data backup. The predictor-corrector interior point method (PIPM) and Q-learning method are leveraged to derive the reasonable solution for the formulated problem, with achieving the optimal allocating data decision and receiving data decision. Extensive simulation results demonstrate that the proposed scheme outperforms the benchmark schemes in terms of individual expected revenue, participation degree and the average amount of data backup.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=10500320,IEEE Internet of Things Journal,2024
Causal Robust Trajectory Prediction Against Adversarial Attacks for Autonomous Vehicles,"Autonomous vehicles may mistakenly predict the future trajectories of neighboring vehicles when the trajectory prediction model is under attack. Recent works utilize adversarial training to mitigate the prediction errors of the trajectory prediction model under attacks. However, adversarial training exhibits high training costs and poor generality for different attack methods. Meanwhile, adversarial training improves the trajectory prediction performance under attacks by learning the adversarial examples, which leads to greater performance degradation in normal (without attacks) cases. In this article, to ensure the driving safety of autonomous vehicles, we propose a causal robust trajectory prediction method named CausalRobTra, which employs total direct effect (TDE) inference to defend trajectory predictors against adversarial attacks from the perspective of causal inference theory. First, we propose four directional metrics to evaluate the prediction errors of the trajectory prediction model under attacks. Then, we construct the causal graph of trajectory prediction under attacks and analyze the causalities among the nodes. Next, we conduct the counterfactual intervention on the history trajectory by replacing the history trajectory with the counterfactual trajectory to cut off the link between the history trajectory and the adversarial perturbation. Finally, we calculate TDE by subtracting the counterfactual prediction from the factual prediction to eliminate the impact of adversarial perturbation on the final prediction. Compared with the no-defense case, our method improves the performance by 13.4% under attacks and at the cost of 7.7% performance degradation on clean data. In addition, our method improves the performance by 20.6% on clean data compared with adversarial training and has a similar performance to adversarial training under attacks. Such an improvement can ensure the safety of autonomous vehicles under attacks and avoid many traffic accidents. Our CausalRobTra is a plug-and-play defense method that can be easily applied to any other trajectory prediction model. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method effectively improves the adversarial robustness of the trajectory prediction model under attacks at the expense of lower performance degradation in normal (without attacks) cases.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=10356632,IEEE Internet of Things Journal,2024

A Survey on Security of Unmanned Aerial Vehicle Systems: Attacks and Countermeasures,"With the wide application of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), security problems of UAV systems are gradually exposed, which bring great risks to UAV application. This article surveys the security of UAV systems, including attacks and countermeasures. First, the UAV system architecture is analyzed to identify security vulnerabilities. A UAV system contains the hardware platform, software platform, radio communication link, and application software. The navigation, guidance, and control systems are three core components in software platform. Then, security threats and attacks are analyzed and categorized from the view of cyberspace security, including spoofing attacks, reply attacks, jamming attacks, Denial-of-Service (DoS) attacks, eavesdropping attacks, side-channel attacks, manipulation attacks, and system intrusion attacks. Countermeasures are categorized based on the UAV system architecture and what attacks each countermeasure type can defend are also summarized. Compared to existing survey on security of a UAV system, more attack types and corresponding countermeasures are concluded. Finally, open issues and corresponding countermeasures on the security of UAV systems are discussed to guide the future research trend, including existing countermeasure weaknesses and challenges, and new issues and challenges.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=10599134,IEEE Internet of Things Journal,2024
ByCAN: Reverse Engineering Controller Area Network (CAN) Messages From Bit to Byte Level,"As the primary standard protocol for modern cars, the controller area network (CAN) is a critical research target for automotive cybersecurity threats and autonomous applications. As the decoding specification of CAN is a proprietary black-box maintained by original equipment manufacturers (OEMs), conducting related research and industry developments can be challenging without a comprehensive understanding of the meaning of CAN messages. In this article, we propose a fully automated reverse-engineering system, named ByCAN, to reverse engineer CAN messages. ByCAN outperforms the existing research by introducing byte-level clusters and integrating multiple features at both the byte and bit levels. ByCAN employs the clustering and template matching algorithms to automatically decode the specifications of CAN frames without the need for prior knowledge. Experimental results demonstrate that ByCAN achieves high accuracy in slicing and labeling performance, i.e., the identification of CAN signal boundaries and labels. In the experiments, ByCAN achieves slicing accuracy of 80.21%, slicing coverage of 95.21%, and labeling accuracy of 68.72% for the general labels when analysing the real-world CAN frames.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85200245334&origin=inward,IEEE Internet of Things Journal,2024
Safety Constrained Trajectory Optimization for Completion Time Minimization for UAV Communications,"In recent years, unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) are considered to be integrated into wireless communication systems because of their tremendous advantages in mobility, cost, maneuverability, etc. In some real UAV-assisted communication scenarios, the dynamics of the environment, such as the roaming of served users, make it hard to obtain an optimal trajectory before the UAV is dispatched. Implanting an intelligent control policy into UAVs for distributed task execution is necessary to complete the task. In this article, a UAV trajectory design problem is investigated for an orthorgonal-frequency-division-multiplexing (OFDM) wireless sensor network, which is dynamic because mobile sensors may randomly roam within a certain range. The UAV is expected to balance task efficiency with the safety constraint with a pretrained onboard control policy. Compared to prior works, this work requires the policy to adapt to randomly generated obstacle maps, and also assumes that the UAV has no prior knowledge of the obstacles before it is dispatched, which brings about challenges to the problem. The motivation comes from adversarial environments without the specific obstacle distribution beforehand, such as a disaster area. The problem is formulated as a constrained Markov decision process (CMDP) model, which incorporates the safety constraint compared to a basic Markov decision process. Due to the assumption of randomized obstacle distribution and lack of prior knowledge, existing algorithms for CMDP can not be applied directly. To tackle this issue, we enhance the reinforcement learning (RL) algorithm with a safety control mechanism to derive our novel safe RL (Safe RL) algorithm, which is based on the framework of the Lagrangian method. Compared to former algorithms about CMDP, our algorithm eliminates the premise that the safety model is known, the agent is able to learn safety judgment from scratch through its interactions with the environment. Simulation results demonstrate that our proposed algorithm outperforms the benchmark algorithm under the problem’s setup.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=10409515,IEEE Internet of Things Journal,2024
Group Authentication and Key Establishment Scheme,"Group authentication is a technique that verifies the group membership of multiple users and establishes a shared secret key among them. Unlike the conventional authentication schemes that rely on a central authority to authenticate each user individually, group authentication can perform the authentication process simultaneously for all the members who participate. Group authentication has been found to be a suitable candidate for various applications in crowded in Internet of Things (IoT) environments, such as swarms of drones for agriculture, military, and surveillance, where a group of devices need to establish a secure authenticated communication channel among themselves. The recently presented group authentication algorithms mainly exploit Lagrange polynomial interpolation along with elliptic curve groups over finite fields. A polynomial interpolation-based group authentication scheme (GAS) has a vulnerability that allows malicious interruption by any single entity in the process. Moreover, this scheme requires each entity to obtain the tokens of all other entities, which is impractical in a large-scale setting. The cost of authentication and key establishment also depends on the number of users, creating a scalability issue. As a fresh approach to eliminate these issues, this work suggests the use of inner product spaces for group authentication and key establishment. The approach with linear spaces introduces a reduced computation and communication load to establish a common shared key among the group members. In addition to providing lightweight authentication and key agreement, this approach allows any user in a group to make a nonmember a member, which is expected to be useful for autonomous systems in the future. The scheme is designed in a way that the sponsors of such members can easily be recognized by anyone in the group. Unlike the other GASs based on Lagrange’s polynomial interpolation, the proposed scheme does not provide a tool for adversaries to compromise the whole group’s secrets by using only a few members’ shares as well as it allows to recognize a nonmember easily, which prevents the denial-of-service attacks from which the former group authentication algorithms suffer.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=10620023,IEEE Internet of Things Journal,2024

Adaptive Policy Learning for Connected Autonomous Vehicles Defending Malicious Access Requests by Graph Reinforcement Learning,"Access requests are used in cooperative tasks among connected and automated vehicles (CAVs). Authorization decisions are determined by dynamic trust values in trust value-based access control (TBAC). Manual policy management in TBAC faces challenges when dealing with massive amounts of access data and dynamic environments. Traditional machine learning methods fail to adequately represent the complex spatio-temporal, decentralized and independent access requests. Policy learning for connected autonomous vehicles by graph reinforcement learning (VPolicy-GRL) is proposed, enhancing the conventional deep Q network (DQN) with a graph neural network (GNN) framework. First, a novel three-layer framework of TBAC for CAVs is proposed. Second, trust relations among CAVs are represented as several spatio-temporal dynamic graphs, enabling context-aware authorization decisions. Malicious access requests are categorized into unauthorized access requests caused by Sybil attacks and interfering access requests caused by DoS attacks. Third, the DQN model for VPolicy-GRL is designed. Results demonstrate that VPolicy-GRL achieves superior feature abstraction with STGCN compared to graph convolutional network, which also obtains higher true rejection rates than Double DQN and DQN for both unauthorized and interfering access requests. Additionally, VPolicy-GRL exhibits improved convergence speed and stability.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=10601238,IEEE Internet of Things Journal,2024
Joint Computation Offloading and Multidimensional Resource Allocation in Air–Ground Integrated Vehicular Edge Computing Network,"The integration of vehicle edge computing (VEC) and air-ground integrated network is considered as a key technology to achieve autonomous driving. It exploits the ubiquitous service coverage and enables tasks to be offloaded to various components, such as high-altitude platform (HAP), unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV), and roadside unit (RSU). In this article, we address the challenge of minimizing the overall task offloading delay in the air-ground integrated VEC network through a joint multicomputation equipment selection and multidimensional resource allocation (JCESRA) problem. Considering the nonconvexity inherent in the problem, we employ the fundamental idea of the block coordinate descent (BCD) method to tackle it. Initially, we exclude the HAP and decompose the primal problem into three subproblems: 1) low-altitude computation equipment selection; 2) joint bandwidth and computation resource allocation; and 3) UAV trajectory design. The first subproblem, which involves integer programming, is solved by using the many-to-one matching method. Meanwhile, we utilize the CVX and successive convex approximation (SCA) method to solve the last two subproblems, respectively. Considering the matching externality, we utilize the coalition game method to deal with it. Based on the solutions of the three subproblems, the JCESRA algorithm without considering the HAP has been proposed. Subsequently, we consider the HAP into the problem. Because the task offloading decision and computation resource allocation of the HAP problem can be viewed as a knapsack problem, we utilize the dynamic programming method to solve it. Because some tasks are offloaded to the HAP, there are some redundant computation resources in UAVs and RSU. We reallocate the computation resources of UAVs and RSU to further reduce the task offloading delay. At last, we present the complete JCESRA algorithm. The simulation results unequivocally indicate that the proposed JCESRA algorithm outperforms other algorithms by significantly reducing the task offloading delay.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85200813645&origin=inward,IEEE Internet of Things Journal,2024
Real-Time Collaborative Intrusion Detection System in UAV Networks Using Deep Learning,"Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) are being used extensively in various fields. UAVs provide various services to users, including monitoring, logistics, and sensing, because of their flexible deployment and dynamic reconfigurability. However, UAV networks have become more susceptible to malicious threats because of their multiconnectivity and openness. A great effort has been made to develop an effective intrusion detection system (IDS) based on machine-learning approaches for UAVs. Unfortunately, existing methods were unable to identify real time and zero-day attacks for UAV networks. This is due to that existing methods have still used obsolete data sets and past knowledge-based detection. Also, the shortcomings of standalone IDS render them unsuitable for defending UAV networks from potential security risks. Further, the lack of precise identification for compromised UAV nodes in UAV networks poses a critical security gap, risking the entire network’s integrity with the compromise of a single node. Therefore, in this work, we propose an autonomous collaborative IDS (UAV-CIDS) with a feedforward convolutional neural network (FFCNN), which accurately identifies zero-day with high accuracy. The proposed solution takes into account encoded Wi-Fi traffic logs of three popular UAVs types: 1) DBPower UDI; 2) parrot Bebop; and 3) DJI spark. Evaluation results indicate that our FFCNN model has produced outstanding results based on the UAVIDS data set with 98.23% accuracy compared to existing models. After the detection of attacks, their mitigation is equally significant. In addition, we also design and implement real-time incident response handling against cyber-attacks on UAV Networks. The incident response handling will assist in minimizing the effects of a security breach, remediate vulnerabilities and systematically secure the entire UAV networks.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=10594772,IEEE Internet of Things Journal,2024

Task Scheduling and Trajectory Optimization Based on Fairness and Communication Security for Multi-UAV-MEC System,"Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) show significant potential in enhancing communication services within the mobile edge computing (MEC) system by taking their advantages on the flexible mobility and reliable line-of-sight links. However, in the scenarios with multiple UAV-MECs (UMs) operating concurrently, potential conflicts in their trajectories need to be mitigated. Thus, the 3-D trajectory needs to be properly designed in a highly reliable manner. Besides, such an infrastructure-free communication paradigm also exposes a potential risk of misuse by malicious parties, which allows them to eavesdrop on private communications, posing a threat to the security and privacy. Therefore, we consider a multi-UAV-assisted MEC communication system, where a UAV maliciously eavesdrops on the data transmission from the user devices (UDs) while a jammer is deployed on the ground to interfere with the eavesdropping channel. In specific, our objective is to minimize the energy consumption and latency while incorporating fairness metrics by optimizing the 3-D trajectories of UMs, transmission power of UDs, and the offloading strategies under the constraints of ensuring communication security and load fairness. Given the complexity of this mixed-integer nonconvex programming problem, we decompose the formulated problem into three subproblems. Specifically, at each time slot, we optimize the transmit power and offloading strategies using theoretical derivation and mathematical analysis, respectively. Additionally, a multiagent deep deterministic policy gradient (MADDPG) algorithm is employed to optimize the trajectories of UMs. Simulation results demonstrate that our proposed joint optimization algorithm successfully minimizes the system energy consumption and delay as compared to benchmarking schemes.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=10554811,IEEE Internet of Things Journal,2024
An Auto-Upgradable End-to-End Preauthenticated Secure Communication Protocol for UAV-Aided Perception Intelligent System,"Unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV)-enabled intelligent systems are emerging and empowering real-time monitoring and modeling tasks. The security requirements in real-time UAV-enabled intelligent systems are data integrity, authenticity, traceability, tamper-proofing, and privacy. A secure channel established by authenticated key agreement (AKA) protocol can cover all the security requirements. However, no UDP-based lightweight pairing-free AKA protocol has been proposed for the UAV system. In this article, we propose a UDP-compatible Curve25519-infrastructural identity-based end-to-end pre-AKA protocol (UDP-IBE2E-pAKA) with system auto-upgrading and direct and lifecycle credential revocation as a lightweight and reliable UDP-based secure communication module for UAV-enabled networks, which perfectly fits the rapid mobility and extremely harsh work environments of UAVs. To protect UAV-enabled systems stable from DDoS attacks, we construct an efficient identity-based signature as a preauthentication mechanism for the verifier to directly authenticate the sender without any redundant operations. In addition, to prevent the corrupted UAV from monitoring and disrupting attacks, our protocol can revoke the malicious entities directly and immediately with a revocation list in the authentication phase. Moreover, online mode auto-upgradable algorithms are designed to achieve key exposure resistance in our protocol. The full proof of the authenticity and privacy are given in this article. The comprehensive comparison with other state-of-the-art end-to-end AKA protocols indicates that our protocol meets the most robustness and highest efficiency on Raspberry Pi 5.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=10559214,IEEE Internet of Things Journal,2024
IOOSC-U2G: An Identity-Based Online/Offline Signcryption Scheme for Unmanned Aerial Vehicle to Ground Station Communication,"With recent progress in Internet of Things technology, it is becoming more and more commonplace to use unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) for inconsiderable purposes. On the other hand, traditionally all of these UAV networks adopt a susceptible open wireless communication, rendering these systems vulnerable to attacks like eavesdropping, tampering, interrupting, and forging. The most effective way to address these security challenges is through signcryption. However, the current signcryption methods are computational and bandwidth intensive, making them unsuitable for the UAVs with limited resources and ground stations (GSs) handling a high volume of messages. To address these challenges, we propose a solution employing an identity-based online/offline signcryption scheme to secure communication from an UAV to GS, known as IOOSC-U2G. This scheme leverages elliptic curve cryptography without the need for time-intensive operations like bilinear pairing. During the online phase, the absence of point multiplication operations, already executed in the offline phase, significantly alleviates computational burdens. This optimization significantly reduces computational overhead throughout the entire signcryption process of messages. Moreover, the IOOSC-U2G scheme ensures the privacy of UAV identities during communication with GS. Additionally, the proposed scheme empowers the GS to verify multiple inputs at once through the batch verification method. We demonstrate that within the random oracle model, the IOOSC-U2G scheme guarantees security, specifically confidentiality and unforgeability, relying on the computational hardness assumptions of the elliptic curve inverse computational Diffie-Hellman problem and the elliptic discrete logarithm problem, respectively. Moreover, our scheme outperforms the current methods, particularly in computational and communication efficiency.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=10547189,IEEE Internet of Things Journal,2024
"Joint Sensing, Communication, and Computation in UAV-Assisted Systems","This article proposes a joint sensing, communication, and computation (JSCC) framework in unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV)-assisted systems, where multifunctional terminal devices (TDs) can perform high-accuracy radar sensing as well as offload computation data to an airborne mobile-edge computing (MEC) server over the same frequency band. The key objective of the JSCC framework is to simultaneously minimize the transmitted sensing beampattern matching error whilst maximizing the minimum computation efficiency of TDs. This problem is formulated as a multiobjective optimization problem (MOOP) that jointly optimizes the transmit beampattern, computation offloading, and UAV trajectory. To achieve the computation–sensing tradeoff region, we first transform the MOOP into a single-objective optimization problem (SOOP) via the  $\epsilon _{1}$ -constraint method. To make it more tractable, a generalized Dinkelbach’s and successive convex approximation (GD-SCA) algorithm is proposed. Specifically, GD-SCA transfers the nonconvex max–min fractional programming in the resultant SOOP by introducing a general auxiliary polynomial via generalized Dinkelbach’s algorithm. Thereafter, the transmit beampattern, computation offloading, and UAV trajectory optimization are decoupled into two nested subproblems, which can be iteratively solved by invoking the successive convex approximation (SCA) method to handle the remaining nonconvex components. The proposed GD-SCA can obtain high-quality suboptimal solutions of the original MOOP. We validate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm by considering two multiple access techniques, i.e., nonorthogonal multiple access (NOMA) and space-division multiple access (SDMA). Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed algorithm can achieve an improved computation–sensing tradeoff region compared to conventional schemes especially when exploiting NOMA. Moreover, the multifunctional performance can be significantly improved while stringently guaranteeing both radar sensing and computation offloading requirements.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=10462480,IEEE Internet of Things Journal,2024
OptiCloak: Blinding Vision-Based Autonomous Driving Systems Through Adversarial Optical Projection,"Studies have proven that applying patch stickers generated through adversarial training to target objects can effectively deceive classifiers or target detectors. These “Print-and-paste” adversarial attacks however have three shortcomings. First, touching the target object physically is required, which may be infeasible in practice. Second, stickers might be taken as evidence to identify the attackers. Third, the attack effect decreases significantly in poor light, especially at long distances. To overcome above limitations, we introduce OptiCloak, a car vanishing attack, which fools the object detector (OD) of a vision-based autonomous driving systems with transient projection pattern. We establish three digital-to-physical mapping models to compensate the distortions caused by perspective deformation, double image, and partial light reflection in real world. Furthermore, to avoid adversarial functionality degeneration caused by the loss of patch details in long-range attacks, we utilize MeanShift Filtering to constrain the “resolution” of pixels in a patch during training. We propose a gradient-free patch updating (GPU) approach, which utilizes ZO-AdaMM to approximate gradients and model parameters through the confidence scores of OD, making OptiCloak can work well in both the white-box and black-box scenarios. We deploy OptiCloak in real-world driving scenarios, and the extensive experimental results demonstrate that the OptiCloak achieves similar attack success rates (ASRs) as printed patches in bright environments, while significantly improving the attack performance in gloomy environments. This effect is validated across all settings, including different angles, imaging devices, and film transparency rates. In black-box settings, the average ASR can reach 71%, with a maximum attack distance of approximately 10 m.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=10538370,IEEE Internet of Things Journal,2024
Towards Semantic Interoperability: An Information Model for Autonomous Mobile Robots,"The collaboration among autonomous mobile robots (AMRs), including unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), unmanned ground vehicles (UGVs), and/or unmanned surface vehicles (USVs), significantly enhances their capabilities by enabling them to tackle more complex tasks exceeding those of individual robots. However, to fully exploit this collaboration, a common understanding of exchanged information—referred to as semantic interoperability—is crucial. Achieving semantic interoperability between these robots requires a deep understanding of relevant information and its underlying structure. To address this challenge, this paper presents a platform- and technology-independent information model developed specifically for AMRs. This model aims to facilitate collaboration by structuring information in a way that ensures semantic interoperability. The paper outlines the model's development process, beginning with a structured consolidation of information from pertinent scientific literature, resulting in a foundational framework for representing knowledge and semantics within the domain of AMRs. The practical application of the information model is demonstrated through a use case involving multiple AMRs. Additionally, the paper provides insights into the employed methodology, emphasizing the significance of systematic literature reviews and collaboration with practitioners to refine and validate the model. It also discusses theoretical and practical implications, addressing potential limitations encountered during the research.",https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007/s10846-024-02159-3.pdf,Journal of Intelligent and Robotic Systems: Theory and Applications,2024
Verification and Validation for a Digital Twin for Augmenting Current SORA Practices with Air-to-Air Collision Hazards Prediction from Small Uncooperative Flying Objects,"Future autonomous Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAV) missions will take place in highly cluttered urban environments. As a result, the UAV must be able to autonomously evaluate risks and react to unforeseen hazards. The current regulatory framework for missions implements SORA guidelines for hazard detection, but its application to air-to-air collision is limited. This research defined a rigorous verification and validation framework (V&amp;V) for digital twins for use in future autonomous UAV missions. The researchers designed a sentry mission for a UAV to evaluate its capacity to detect small uncooperative flying objects. A digital twin of the DJI M300 vision system was built using a game engine and a V&amp;V framework was developed to assure the quality of results in both virtual and real-world scenarios. The results showed the capability of the digital twin to identify vulnerabilities and worst-case scenarios in UAV mission operations, and how it can assist remote pilots in identifying air-to-air collision hazards. Furthermore, the probability of air-to-air collision was calculated for three sentry patterns, and the results were validated in the field. This research demonstrated the capability to identify vulnerabilities and worst-case scenarios in UAV mission operations. We present how the digital twin of an operational theatre can be exploited to assist remote pilots with the identification of air-to-air collision hazards of small uncooperative objects. Furthermore, we discuss how these results can be used to enhance current SORA-based risk assessment practices.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85199500358&origin=inward,Journal of Intelligent and Robotic Systems: Theory and Applications,2024
Privacy’s Sky-High Battle: The Use of Unmanned Aircraft Systems for Law Enforcement in the European Union,"Benefiting from the rapid advancements in Unmanned Aircraft Systems (UAS) technology with enhanced tracking and data collection capabilities, law enforcement authorities re-discovered air as a dimension where state power can be exercised in a more affordable, accessible, and compact way. On the other hand, during law enforcement operations, UAS can collect various types of data that can be personal or sensitive, threatening the right to privacy and data protection of the data subjects. Risks include challenges related to data security, bulk data collection, the diminished transparency and fairness resulting from the inconspicuous nature of UAS, as well as ethical concerns intertwined with privacy and data protection. Upon examination of the legal framework including the General Data Protection Regulation the Law Enforcement Directive, various Aviation rules, and the new proposal for the Artificial Intelligence Act, it becomes apparent that the EU legal framework’s adequacy in safeguarding privacy and data protection against law enforcement use of UAS is context-dependent, varying across use cases. The current framework lacks clarity, leading to arbitrary application and limited protection for data subjects. Enforcement of safeguards is insufficient, and the Aviation Regulations, applicable to law enforcement UAS, require member states' opt-in, which has not occurred as of the authors’ knowledge. The Artificial Intelligence Act addresses UAS operations but focuses on market risks rather than obligations imposed on law enforcement authorities. Consequently, the existing framework is rendered inadequate for medium to high-risk law enforcement operations, leaving individuals vulnerable and insufficiently protected against intrusive UAS surveillance. Rectifying this involves addressing the enforcement gap and making the necessary amendments to relevant regulatory aspects. Additionally, the implementation of specific technical measures and steps to foster effective cooperation among stakeholders in UAS deployment for law enforcement is imperative.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85198030550&origin=inward,Journal of Intelligent and Robotic Systems: Theory and Applications,2024

Multi-AUV Collaboration-Assisted Location Privacy Protection Scheme in Unknown Marine Environments,"With the increase in the status of the ocean, the development of ocean resources is a priority, as is ocean security. Ocean security contains several aspects, such as equipment security, data security, military security, and so on. Location privacy protection of ocean equipment during data collection missions in unknown environments is investigated and a multiple autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs) collaboration-assisted location privacy-preserving scheme is proposed in this thesis. In an unknown environment, several AUVs gather together to form a swarm to perform regional detection and defense missions. The swarm may face potential active and passive attacks, and the leader AUV is in the priority of protection. In this case, the follower AUVs deploy nodes in an unknown environment to make a rough sense. Then, the nodes build a Voronoi diagram based on their own perceptions to form a graph. Based on this graph, the AUV divides the nodes into regions by density-based spatial clustering of applications with noise (DBSCAN) and uses rapidly exploring random trees (RRT) to plan the path in an unknown environment. Finally, the fake data along with the randomness of the moving follower AUV contribute to the location privacy-preserving during the regional detection and defense mission. Compared with the previous two schemes, the simulation results of the proposed method show some advantages in certain metrics.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=10522477,IEEE Internet of Things Journal,2024
UAV-Assisted Active Sparse Crowdsensing for Ground Signal Map Construction Based on 3-D Spatial–Temporal Correlation,"Mobile crowdsensing (MCS) has been applied for signal map construction in smart city. MCS leverages the mobility of users and the sensors embedded in mobile phones to collect and transfer sensing data. However, it is still costly for MCS to cover large-scale regions. Accordingly, data recovery algorithms are proposed, which allow participants to collect only few signal data and infer the remainder by leveraging spatialtemporal correlation of signals. However, existing work only considered the temporal and 2-D spatial correlation in the plane, while the altitude dimension is not exploited. In this article, we give an attempt to exploit the 3-D spatialtemporal correlation of signals to infer missing data and reconstruct ground signal map, where unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) can be used to collect signals from the air. Two UAV-assisted ground signal map construction schemes are proposed based on the propagation loss (PL) and convolution neural network (CNN). To further reduce the number of aerial samples required and reduce the cost incurred by UAV, a random-active sampling strategy is proposed to select more valuable signals in our work. Extensive simulations are performed which show that the proposed framework and schemes perform well under extremely high missing rate situations and outperform pure ground-based data recovery schemes. In addition, experiments for both indoor and outdoor are conducted to further verify the effectiveness of the proposed schemes.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=10533259,IEEE Internet of Things Journal,2024
RIS-Assisted UAV-Enabled Green Communications for Industrial IoT Exploiting Deep Learning,"Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT), regarded as an important technology for Industry 4.0, has the capability to connect massive IoT devices anywhere and at anytime in manufacturing industry. Enabling such a huge network requires message delivering among sensors, actuators, controllers, and the remote control to be seamless and reliable. However, IIoT wireless environment typically faces challenges such as blockage caused by IoT obstacles. To tackle the above issue, the unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) and the reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS) are exploited in this article, which can provide favorable air-to-ground links and further rebuild the wireless channels. Moreover, the device-to-device (D2D) communication technique is introduced to enable direct information exchange between IoT devices. Specifically, we consider both the communication between the UAV and the cellular users (e.g., fixed IoT infrastructures) as well as the communication between D2D users (e.g., mobile IoT devices). Instead of only considering throughput, we focus on energy efficiency (EE) optimization for D2D users while guaranteeing the quality of service for cellular users, since energy-efficient transmission or green communication is important for IIoT scenarios. The transmit power, channel allocation parameters, and RIS’s reflection coefficients are jointly optimized to maximize EE for D2D users. To solve the formulated optimization problem, both centralized and distributed optimization algorithms based on deep neural networks are provided. Simulation results show that the introduction of RIS can significantly improve system performance. Moreover, the proposed algorithms can approximate the optimal solutions without the need of exhaustive search.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=10445177,IEEE Internet of Things Journal,2024

Optimal Transmit Power and Hovering Location for UAV Covert Communication in IoT Systems,"Internet of Things (IoT) play a paramount role in every aspect of our daily lives. Due to more diverse human needs, the future IoT networks are expected to be highly dynamic and heterogeneous with assistance of mobile nodes, such as unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs). However, the broadcast and openness nature of wireless communication and high-mobile characteristic of UAV can cause security threats to UAV-assisted IoT systems. For this sake, we consider exploiting covert communication to provide such a system with a higher level communication security, which can prevent the legitimate transmission being detected by the adversary monitor. Specifically, this article jointly optimizes the transmit power and hovering location of the UAV to guarantee communication security in the IoT system. We maximize the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of the legitimate receiver in presence of a malicious warden, with constraints of communication covertness, the UAV’s spatial location and maximum transmit power. Particularly, the UAV’s location is represented in terms of angles, rather than the commonly used distance, in most of the literature. The optimal location is determined in two steps. The simulation results show that the proposed optimization schemes can effectively find the optimal hovering location and transmit power of the UAV to maximize the receiver’s SNR under the covertness constraint. The optimal hovering location is directly above the line connecting the legitimate receiver and the warden, and in close proximity within the small region directly above the receiver, which has implications for other analogous research scenarios or practical applications of UAV.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=10510254,IEEE Internet of Things Journal,2024
Toward Intelligent Lightweight and Efficient UAV Identification With RF Fingerprinting,"The inherent flexibility of small unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) enables their deployment across various emerging markets. Unauthenticated UAVs pose a significant threat if they intrude into aviation-sensitive areas. To address this issue, deep learning (DL)-based radio frequency fingerprint identification (RFFI) has been developed as a promising approach for identifying illegal UAVs. However, these commonly used DL-based methods demand high computation and storage requirements, which are not suitable for the deployment of RFFI. In this article, we propose an efficient and low-complexity RFFI method for UAV identification. Specifically, we design a lightweight backbone network consisting of lightweight multiscale convolution (LMSC) blocks that can significantly reduce the model size and enhance the feature extraction ability. The simulation results indicate that our proposed UAV RFFI method outperforms other state-of-the-art and popular DL-based RFFI methods in terms of both identification performance and complexity. The identification accuracy surpasses that of all other methods at low signal-to-noise ratios (SNRs) and achieves nearly 100% accuracy at high SNRs. To further enhance model efficiency, we employ data truncation in our experimental simulations, demonstrating that a sample length of 2000 is sufficient to retain high identification performance. Additionally, we incorporate the Mixup regularization strategy, which improves accuracy without increasing the complexity, especially as sample length decreases.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=10513356,IEEE Internet of Things Journal,2024

ESMU: Efficient and Secure High-Precision Map Upload and Update Scheme in Intelligent IoT System,"With the development of autonomous driving technology, the accuracy requirements for electronic maps are becoming increasingly high.And high-precision maps, as a key carrier of intelligent IoT System in the field of transportation, has become a necessity for autonomous driving. The drawing of high-precision maps cannot be separated from the data collection of convoys, but there are security issues, such as pseudo mobility attacks and low-data privacy in this process. Therefore, a hybrid authentication architecture for map collection vehicles and base stations (BSs) based on alliance blockchain is proposed. This architecture has significant effectiveness in resisting mobile pseudo BS attacks, achieving authentication of access point vehicles by mobile BSs. At the same time, in order to effectively adapt to high-precision map scenarios, the proposed key distribution strategy and high-precision map update method are both lightweight. Last but not least, we analyze and evaluate the performance of ESMU through rigorous theoretical analysis and extensive experimental verification. The results demonstrate its high efficiency and strong robustness.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=10445404,IEEE Internet of Things Journal,2024
CCID-CAN: Cross-Chain Intrusion Detection on CAN Bus for Autonomous Vehicles,"Autonomous vehicles (AVs) rely on controller area network (CAN), which ensures the communication between massive electronic control units (ECUs) and passenger safety. Although CAN is a lightweight and reliable broadcast protocol, its vulnerability has caused CAN to confront serious security threats. Adversaries and malicious organizations can impair CAN bus in a variety of ways, such as injecting malicious messages into CAN bus. These malicious messages can directly intervene the functions inside AVs. Therefore, this article proposes a novel cross-chain-based intrusion detection for CAN bus (CCID-CAN) model that uses rule-based valid bit index (VBIN) model for initial intrusion detection on CAN bus inside AVs, followed by the Kalman filter and Naïve Bayes model for detecting attacks missed in the VBIN, where a cross-chain mechanism implements the exchange of attack logs among connected AVs that may not trust each other so as to optimize the Naïve Bayes detector. Afterwards, a series of experiments against several types of attacks are conducted on real vehicle supported by XPeng, and the results reveal that the CCID-CAN model outperforms existing models in terms of detection performance, time overhead, and memory footprint. In addition, attack log exchange for cross-chain networks in this proposed model is of high performance in latency, memory footprint, and throughput.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=10508208,IEEE Internet of Things Journal,2024

Transferability of Adversarial Attacks on Tiny Deep Learning Models for IoT Unmanned Aerial Vehicles,"In the realm of miniature machine learning for Internet of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), the security concerns of machine-learning models are obvious, especially when it comes to adversarial attacks. Models can become confused and their performance is undermined by the introduction of meticulously crafted distortions. These attacks can even infiltrate a variety of models, bringing greater security risks. To understand how it works and mitigate its effects, our research focuses on scrutinizing the transferability of adversarial attacks in the expanding context of miniature machine learning for UAVs. In this article, we introduce a formula to help measure the transferability of adversarial attacks and explore ways to improve the transferability and effectiveness of adversarial attacks (e.g., a combination of attack techniques), and provide visualizations to vividly illustrate the repercussions of adversarial instances across a spectrum of attack intensities, helping facilitate more intuitive exploration and analysis of the results. For instance, our findings demonstrate that even subtle perturbations directed at specific attributes can lead to a significant decrease in model accuracy. We also evaluate the success rates of various attack algorithms and validate the proposed evaluation methodology for measuring transferability. And the outcomes unveiled in this study make noteworthy strides in fostering a profound comprehension of the transferability of adversarial attacks in the distinct realm of miniature machine learning for UAVs.

Intrusion Detection for Unmanned Aerial Vehicles Security: A Tiny Machine Learning Model,"Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) are vulnerable to network attacks. Designing an effective intrusion detection system (IDS) for UAVs is crucial. However, UAVs have limited computing resources and need to deal with massive amounts of network data, which further increases the difficulty of detection. Moreover, most existing IDSs have large parameters. In this study, we develop a tiny machine learning-based IDS to solve the above issue. We first establish an improved fuzzy rough set (FRS) model based on adaptive neighborhoods.

Path Planning of Autonomous Mobile Robot in Comprehensive Unknown Environment Using Deep Reinforcement Learning,"In real-world situations, some unavoidable problems like significant dependence on environment information, long inference time and weak anti-disturbance ability are often involved in path planning of autonomous mobile robot (AMR) under unknown environments. To solve these issues, this article proposes an improved deep reinforcement learning-based path-planning algorithm to find out an optimized path for a class of AMRs. First, the path planning of AMR is described as a Markov decision process framework, and the double deep  $Q$  network (DDQN) is utilized to obtain the optimal adaptive solutions of AMR’s path planning. Second, a comprehensive reward function integrated with heuristic function is designed to navigate the AMR into the target area. Afterwards, an optimized deep neural network with an adaptive  $\varepsilon $ -greedy action selection policy is designed to deal with the tradeoff between exploration and exploitation, thus further to improve the global searching capability and the convergence performance for the AMR path planning. Moreover, Bezier curve theory is utilized to smooth the planned path. Finally, the comparative simulations are carried out to validate our proposed path-planning algorithm. The results show that, compared with DQN, A*, RRT, and APF algorithms, our improved DDQN algorithm can produce safer and shorter global paths in comprehensive unknown environments. Meanwhile, the IDDQN algorithm has strong adaptability to random disturbances in unknown environments.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85188437630&origin=inward,IEEE Internet of Things Journal,2024

Bias-Compensation Augmentation Learning for Semantic Segmentation in UAV Networks,"In the realm of emergency disaster relief, it is paramount to attain a thorough comprehension of the semantic information associated with the local disaster scene for strategic rescue path planning and immediate rescue operations for affected individuals. Unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) networks are widely utilized for rapid data collection in the aftermath of disasters due to their flexibility and maneuverability, assisting in rescue decision-making. However, some disasters, such as seismic events and floods, have disrupted the initially structured ground shape information, leading to a disparate distribution of data collected by various UAV groups. This exposes traditional semantic segmentation models susceptible to shortcut bias, posing challenges in adapting to semantic segmentation tasks in disaster scenarios. Thus, this article proposes a bias-compensation augmentation learning-based semantic segmentation framework, which substantially enhances the extraction capability of semantic information. Initially, we exploit an artificial augmentation neural network for bias-awareness to determine the relative bias values of the collected image data. Subsequently, considering the limited computing power resources in UAV networks, we present a bias compensation computation offloading strategy to achieve a relatively balanced distribution of semantic information across UAV nodes, optimizing the tradeoff between network scheduling efficiency and model accuracy. We conduct reconstruction validation on the FloodNet data set, and a plethora of experimental results demonstrate that, compared to traditional methods, this approach greatly improves the accuracy of pixel-level semantic segmentation by over 86.5%. Moreover, the average combined processing time is also reduced by over 50%, enhancing the utilization efficiency of limited computational resources.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85188463607&origin=inward,IEEE Internet of Things Journal,2024
Learning-Based Energy Minimization Optimization for IRS-Assisted Master-Auxiliary-UAV-Enabled Wireless-Powered IoT Networks,"This article investigates master-auxiliary unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs)-enabled wireless-powered Internet of Things (WPIoT) networks, which overcome the inflexibility and site selection issues caused by traditional fixed-point intelligent reflecting surface (IRS). Specifically, multiple rechargeable master UAVs (MUAVs) and IRS-integrated auxiliary UAVs (AUAVs) are applied in pairs to cooperatively charge and collect data from Internet of Things devices clustered in different subareas under cloud scheduling. Given the constraints of limited onboard battery capacity and complete data collection, we formulate a system energy minimization problem, which is then divided into three subproblems. We first utilize a pair of U-nets with quantization layers trained by deep unsupervised learning (DUL) to output discrete downlink (DL) and uplink (UL) IRS phases separately. Gradient functions with specific features are also proposed to solve nondifferentiable issue during training. Given the optimized IRS phase policies, off-policy deep reinforcement learning (DRL) is exploited to optimize intrasubarea data collection policy and intersubarea multi-UAV scheduling scheme. Two assistive techniques, positive transition initialization (PTI) and action mask, are proposed to guide the learning of the agent and alleviate the burden of optimization. Numerical results indicate that our proposed approach combining DUL with DRL can improve performance by more than 90% compared to the pure DRL method. Furthermore, our proposed master-auxiliary-UAV collaborative data collection scheme (MACS) can achieve better energy performance than homogeneous MUAV data collection scheme (HMCS) in cases with low-onboard battery capacity while halving task completion time.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85188005806&origin=inward,IEEE Internet of Things Journal,2024

One of the critical tasks is to guarantee a secure network access while achieving tradeoff between accuracy and latency through lightweight deployment on resource-limited and hardware-constrained UAVs. To address this issue, a novel noise-tolerant radio frequency fingerprinting (NT-RFF) based on tiny machine learning (TinyML) scheme is proposed, which amalgamates contrastive learning and data augmentation, aiming to improve the generalization ability of unauthorized device identification (UDI). Particularly, we first exploit the augmentation technique to enhance the legitimate training data sets under the circumstance of varying signal-to-noise ratios, facilitating an enhanced and diversified data sets. Second, a synthesis of contrastive learning and supervised learning is employed to attain comprehensive global learning. We design a new contrastive loss criteria to capture relevant information from the samples collected over the air. Besides, we design a categorical cross-entropy loss criteria by which supervisory information can be leveraged from associated labels. Finally, quantification is utilized to enhance model efficiency and achieve an optimal balance between accuracy and latency within computing and energy resource-limited UAVs. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed tiny NT-RFF which only contains about 25–30% quantitative parameters can maintain excellent performance and improve the UDI accuracy greatly compared with the traditional machine learning-based RFF schemes. Moreover, the remarkable results showcase that our proposed framework attains a substantial increase in identification accuracy compared to the data augmentation and contrastive learning-based RFF and DASL-RFF methods, exhibiting improvements of 14.16% and 5.17%, respectively.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=10478518,IEEE Internet of Things Journal,2024
Giant Could Be Tiny: Efficient Inference of Giant Models on Resource-Constrained UAVs,"Giant models, characterized by their billions or even trillions of parameters, has demonstrated unprecedented capabilities in handling complex tasks on artificial intelligence (AI)-driven unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), such as disaster relief, aerial navigation, and manipulation. However, there is an open challenge about the mismatching between the massive computation and memory requirements of giant models and the limited resources on UAVs. Existing works either pose privacy concerns with offloading methods or compromise model accuracy with various model compression techniques. In this article, we fill the gap by exploiting the Mixture-of-Expert (MoE) model architecture that decouples giant models into multiple tiny experts, so that UAVs can dynamically load a few experts that best match their current input. We consider a general scenario of several edge servers feeding experts to multiple UVAs and formulate a core problem of expert selection and UAV-edge association. Due to the high complexity of this problem, we propose a solution, termed GESolver, based on graph learning, which automatically solves the problem by learning the complicated interaction between edge servers, UAVs, as well as their required experts. We evaluate our proposed method with three popular MoE-based models under various problem settings. The experiments demonstrate that our proposed method can significantly outperform other baselines.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=10437990,IEEE Internet of Things Journal,2024

This interconnected communication framework holds promise for various applications, from collaborative decision-making to real-time data exchange. However, the expansion of communication in IoD also introduces new challenges, particularly in terms of security, privacy and authentication. Unfortunately, the current authentication protocols are inadequate in offering robust security features against various attacks in the IoD environment. To address these security issues and limitations, we proposed a secure protocol for the IoD environment using chaotic maps and hash functions. In addition, we also employed a physically unclonable function in the development of the proposed protocol. We assess the security of the protocol through both informal and formal security analysis. The formal security analysis is conducted through a widely used random or real (RoR) model. The informal analysis shows the rigorous security features against various attacks, such as masquerading, anonymity violation, and physical cloning attacks. Moreover, we compare the performance of the devised protocol with similar existing protocols across important performance parameters, such as communication overhead, computation overhead, and security features. The devised protocol provides a 67.86% and 17.80% reduction in computation and communication overheads, respectively, as compared to related protocols. The analysis demonstrates the proposed protocol’s capacity to support secure communication in the IoD environment and satisfy desirable security attributes.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=10477269,IEEE Internet of Things Journal,2024
Attack Detection and Security Control for UAVs Against Attacks on Desired Trajectory,"The paper presents a security control scheme for unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) against desired trajectory attacks. The key components of the proposed scheme are the attack detector, attack estimator, and integral sliding mode security controller (ISMSC). We focus on malicious tampering of the desired trajectory sent by the ground control station (GCS) to the UAV by attackers. Firstly, we model attacks by analyzing the characteristics of desired trajectory attacks. Secondly, an integrated attack detection scheme based on an unknown input observer (UIO) and an interval observer is presented. Subsequently, a robust adaptive observer (RAO) is employed to compensate for the impact of attacks on the control system. Thirdly, an ISMSC with an attack compensation mechanism is established. Finally, simulation results are provided to verify the effectiveness of the proposed scheme. The proposed detection scheme can not only detect desired trajectory attacks but also distinguish them from abrupt unknown disturbances (AUDs). By utilizing ISMSC method, UAVs under desired trajectory attacks can fly safely. The proposed comprehensive framework of detection, estimation and compensation provides a theoretical basis for ensuring cyber security in UAVs.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85191760099&origin=inward,Journal of Intelligent and Robotic Systems: Theory and Applications,2024

Authentication and Key Agreement Based on Three Factors and PUF for UAV-Assisted Post-Disaster Emergency Communication,"For unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs)-assisted post-disaster emergency communication networks, UAVs serve as relay nodes of air-based backup network to support transmission of rescue messages to emergency communication vehicles (ECVs), while ECVs provide on-site ground communication and connectivity to the command center (CC) of the rescue operation. Existing works seldom emphasize communication security, such as authenticity of communicating parties and integrity of message content. In this connection, authentication and key agreement (AKA) protocols are promising solutions for achieving communication security. However, the traditional approaches to endpoint security and entity authentication of principals may not be practical in emergency situations, in which network equipment and security modules are exposed to an open and untrusted physical environment. Besides, there is a lack of attention to the study of privacy impacts resulted from the physical loss of UAVs. More importantly, cyber attacks and excessive overhead may deteriorate AKA availability. Motivated by the above challenges, we propose an AKA protocol, namely, AKAEC, which is based on three-factor (i.e., smart card, biometrics, and password) and physically unclonable function (PUF) for protecting UAVs-assisted emergency communication. Specifically, AKAEC includes ECV-to-UAV (E2U) and UAV-to-UAV (U2U), where the former achieves secure emergency communication between ECV and UAV, while the latter realizes secure emergency communication between UAV and UAV. We then provide a formal security proof under the real-or-random (ROR) model and formal security verification by automated validation of Internet security protocol and application. This is followed by a security analysis to show that AKAEC meets the security goals defined for emergency situations. Finally, the performance of AKAEC is evaluated from communication overhead and computational overhead.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=10453335,IEEE Internet of Things Journal,2024
Optimization of Placement and Resource Allocation in UAV-Aided Multihop Wireless Networks,"This article investigates the performance of cellular networks assisted by unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) acting as flying base stations (FlyBSs). We focus on a scenario with multihop relaying via FlyBSs to deliver data from a ground base station (GBS) to users in a challenging case with the channels reused at all hops to exploit radio resources efficiently. Our objective is to maximize the sum capacity of the users via an optimization of FlyBSs’ position in 3-D, association of users to either GBS or to one of the FlyBSs, allocation of channels for communication at individual hops, and allocation of transmission power for all channels. Moreover, practical constraints on the FlyBSs’ movement, transmission and propulsion power, and backhaul capacity are taken into account. Due to a nonconvexity and discreetness of the objective and some constraints, there is no optimal solution to the formulated problem. Thus, we propose an analytical solution based on an alternating optimization of an energy-efficient placement of the FlyBSs, channel allocation, user association, and transmission power. Each subproblem in the alternating optimization is substituted either by a linear programming (LP) problem through a change of variables, or by a convex problem via a conversion of the objective and constraints. The results show an increase in sum capacity by 35%–60% compared to related works while the FlyBSs’ propulsion power consumption is not increased.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=10444018,IEEE Internet of Things Journal,2024
Collect Spatiotemporally Correlated Data in IoT Networks With an Energy-Constrained UAV,"Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) are promising tools for efficient data collections of sensors in Internet of Things networks. Existing studies exploited both spatial and temporal data correlations to reduce the amount of collected redundant data, in which sensors are first partitioned into different clusters, a master sensor in each cluster then collects raw data from other sensors and compresses the received data. An energy-constrained UAV finally collects the maximum amount of compressed data from different master sensors. We however notice that the compressed data from only a portion of clusters are collected by the UAV in the existing studies, while the data from other clusters are not collected at all. In this article, we study a problem of finding a data collection trajectory for an energy-constrained UAV, so that the accumulative utility of collected data is maximized, where the accumulative utility measures the quality of spatiotemporally correlated data collected from different clusters. We propose a novel  ${} [{1}/({6+\epsilon })]$ -approximation algorithm for the problem, where  $\epsilon $  is a given constant with  $\epsilon > 0$ . Experimental results with real data sets show that the accumulative utility by the proposed algorithm is at least 23% larger than those by the existing studies, and the number of clusters collected by the proposed algorithm is from 45% to 105% larger than those by the existing studies.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85188905716&origin=inward,IEEE Internet of Things Journal,2024
A Lightweight and Anonymous Application-Aware Authentication and Key Agreement Protocol for the Internet of Drones,"The drone technology has continuously been evolving since the beginning of the first decade of the 21st century with exceptional growth over the last several years. To pave the way for an interoperable aerial-ground communication platform, the Internet of Drones (IoD) framework has emerged to systematically organize a batch of drones to collect multiple application-specific data simultaneously and report them to a close ground station. As the collected data might contain sensitive information, people become more critically aware of data security and privacy issues associated with IoD applications. Authentication and key agreement protocols are able to protect IoD data from unauthorized access. However, the recent schemes fail to distinguish between types of data during the authentication and key establishment process, which leads to data leakage that sensitive data are being accessed by unauthorized entities. To address the data leakage issue and fill the research gap, this article proposes a lightweight and anonymous application-aware authentication and key agreement protocol (also called liteA4) for IoD systems. The fundamental idea of liteA4 is that the ground station and the drone perform data type-aware mutual authentication and establish separate session keys for different types of data before the drone delivers the collected data to the ground station. The major techniques, such as hash function, bitwise xor, and physical unclonable function (PUF), are used to implement liteA4. We select the Automated Validation of Internet Security Protocols and Applications (AVISPAs) tool to verify the security of liteA4 in the cyber-threat environment. We also set up a simulation framework and conduct comprehensive and comparative experiments to validate the performance of liteA4. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that liteA4 not only is a safe and reliable protocol in the adversarial setting but also provides better results than its counterpart approaches in terms of communication overhead, computational time, storage cost, as well as energy consumption.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85186072848&origin=inward,IEEE Internet of Things Journal,2024
Spoofing Detection for LiDAR in Autonomous Vehicles: A Physical-Layer Approach,"Recent years have witnessed the ever-growing interest and adoption of autonomous vehicles (AVs), thanks to the latest advancement in sensing and artificial intelligence (AI) technologies. The LiDAR sensor is adopted by most AV manufacturers for its high precision and high reliability. Unfortunately, LiDARs are susceptible to malicious spoofing attacks, which can lead to severe safety consequences for AVs. Most current work focuses on protecting LiDAR against spoofing attacks by using perception model-level defense methods, whose effectiveness unfortunately depends on the correctness of the LiDAR’s sensing outcome. A spoofer thus can elude from these methods as long as it fabricates points that maintain the right contextual relationship held by the legitimate points. In this article, we propose to use the signal’s Doppler frequency shift to verify the sender of the signal and detect potential spoofing attacks. To this end, we first thoroughly analyze the working principle of LiDAR and conduct real-world experiments to deeply understand and reveal the vulnerability of LiDAR sensors. We then prove that the Doppler frequency shifts of legitimate and spoofing signals present different characteristics, which can be used to fundamentally protect the LiDAR sensing outcome. For better demonstration purposes, we consider three attack models, including static attacker, moving attacker, and moving attacker with control of both velocity and signal frequency. For each of the models, we first show how the spoofing attack is performed and then present our countermeasures. We then propose a statistical spoofing detection framework to jointly consider the impact of short-term uncertainty in vehicle velocity, which can provide more accurate spoofing detection results in realistic environments. Extensive numerical results are provided in a wide range of settings and road conditions.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=10453355,IEEE Internet of Things Journal,2024

Timeliness and Secrecy-Aware Uplink Data Aggregation for Large-Scale UAV-IoT Networks,"Due to the inherent characteristics of system extensibility and implementation flexibility, unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV)-assisted data aggregations will play an essential role in Internet of Things (IoT) networks, where both communication security and timeliness are of high priority. In this article, we study uplink data aggregation in cooperative jamming-aided large-scale UAV-IoT networks under the threat of eavesdroppers. By employing stochastic geometry, we derive performance metrics related to the age of information (AoI) and secrecy outage probability (SOP) in a system-level manner, and formulate the combat between legitimate entities (i.e., IoT devices and cooperative jammers) and eavesdroppers as a two-stage Stackelberg game. To solve the formulated game, the backward induction method is utilized to obtain the Stackelberg equilibrium (SE) iteratively. Specifically, we first obtain the minimum detection error probability for the eavesdropper by optimizing its detection threshold using the successive convex approximation (SCA) technique. Subsequently, the minimization of AoI violation probability and SOP for the legitimate entity is achieved using the proposed tighter  $\alpha $  branch and bound (T- $\alpha $ BB) method by jointly optimizing the transmit powers of the typical IoT device and cooperative jammers as well as the deployment altitude of the typical UAV. Extensive numerical results demonstrate that the proposed solution converges rapidly, with the timeliness and secrecy metrics decreasing by 25.1%, 33.1%, 35.9%, and 37.6% compared to the benchmark scheme in suburban, urban, dense urban, and high-rise urban environments, respectively.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=10411997,IEEE Internet of Things Journal,2024

A Subarray Selection Scheme for Cellular-Connected UAV With Conformal Phased Array Antenna,"In this article, the millimeter wave (mmWave) cellular-connected unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) equipped with conformal phased array antennas in cylindrical shape is investigated, where the UAV acts as an aerial user and served by the base station (BS). Although the cylindrical conformal array (CCA)-enabled UAV can achieve the full spatial coverage and fully exploit the beam gain with directional antenna elements, the curved carrier of conformal array forces the cellular-connected UAV to activate only a portion of antenna elements rather than activating the entire of them to mitigate the severe aerial-ground interference from other BSs. The subarray selection problem is formulated to maximize signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR) with nonlinear antenna radiation patterns. To handle the nonlinearity of objective problem, we propose a low-complexity subarray selection scheme based on the genetic algorithm (GA), which utilizes only the information that UAV can acquire in practical scenarios. The simulation results demonstrate that the proposed subarray selection scheme always shows higher SINR and achievable rate compared to the benchmark schemes. Specifically, the proposed subarray selection scheme shows an achievable rate that is about 2% higher than the accelerated particle swarm optimization (APSO) algorithm, and its computational complexity is only about 25%. In addition, the proposed scheme has near optimal performance while having only about 10.4% complexity compared to the optimal subarray obtained through the full search.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=10335913,IEEE Internet of Things Journal,2024
Collaborative Data Acquisition for UAV-Aided IoT Based on Time-Balancing Scheduling,"The emergence of the Internet of Things (IoT) has revolutionized various domains by enabling seamless connectivity and real-time data exchange between connected IoT devices. However, in sparse deployment scenarios where sensor nodes (SNs) are sparsely distributed, ensuring low data delivery latency becomes a significant challenge. Our research aims to address this issue by utilizing unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) to support IoT networks. In the existing UAV-aided IoT systems, all UAVs are required to return to the base station (BS) to deliver data, which results in significant data delivery latency. To overcome this limitation, we propose a collaborative data acquisition model that uses air-to-air data relay between UAVs. By leveraging the mobility and agility of UAVs, the proposed system facilitates efficient data relay between SNs and the BS. To further optimize the performance of the system, we present a time-balancing scheduling data acquisition (TSDA) scheme. This scheme combines a centripetal-based relay pairing method for UAVs to achieve seamless data relay and a joint scheduling scheme to minimize the hovering time during data delivery. Through extensive simulations, we demonstrate that the proposed TSDA scheme can achieve lower data delivery latency in sparse deployment scenarios compared to existing data acquisition schemes. In addition, the joint scheduling scheme can significantly reduce the hovering time of UAVs so that the collaborative relaying advantage can be better exploited.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=10342863,IEEE Internet of Things Journal,2024
Fractional Optimal Control for Malware Propagation in Internet of Underwater Things,"The Internet of Underwater Things (IoUT) relies on wireless communication devices that are arranged in an open underwater environment and can interact with other devices through acoustic communication technology. However, due to their limited resources and open underwater environment, IoUT has been suffering from a high risk of malware attacks. As the two main parts of IoUT, autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs) and underwater wireless rechargeable sensor networks (UWRSNs) are more favored by attackers and can be directly attacked by malware, which can lead to the cross-propagation of malware when AUVs and UWRSNs exchange information. To mitigate that threat, there is an urgent need to study the propagation patterns of malware and control their spread. Therefore, we establish a mathematical model based on the fractional-order theoretical framework to investigate the malware propagation patterns in two coupled networks (UWRSNs and AUVs). Then, we combine immune, charging, and quarantine delays in control and derive the optimal control strategies based on optimal control theory. Moreover, to improve the generality of control, we propose a machine learning (ML) controller that combines ML [e.g., deep neural network (DNN) and random forest (RF)] with control theory. Ultimately, our simulation experiments show that the proposed optimal control strategy is more effective in inhibiting the spread of malware while obtaining the minimum control cost under different fractional-order scenes. At the same time, the ML-based control results are close to the optimal control.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85177084319&origin=inward,IEEE Internet of Things Journal,2024

A State-Decomposition DDPG Algorithm for UAV Autonomous Navigation in 3-D Complex Environments,"Over the past decade, unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) have been widely applied in many areas, such as goods delivery, disaster monitoring, search and rescue etc. In most of these applications, autonomous navigation is one of the key techniques that enable UAV to perform various tasks. However, UAV autonomous navigation in complex environments presents significant challenges due to the difficulty in simultaneously observing, orientation, decision and action. In this work, an efficient state-decomposition deep deterministic policy gradient algorithm is proposed for UAV autonomous navigation (SDDPG-NAV) in 3-D complex environments. In SDDPG-NAV, a novel state-decomposition method that uses two subnetworks for the perception-related and target-related states separately is developed to establish more appropriate actor networks. We also designed some objective-oriented reward functions to solve the sparse reward problem, including approaching the target, and avoiding obstacles and step award functions. Moreover, some training strategies are introduced to maintain the balance between exploration and exploitation, and the network is well trained with numerous experiments. The proposed SDDPG-NAV algorithm is capable of adapting to surrounding environments with generalized training experiences and effectively improves UAV’s navigation performance in 3-D complex environments. Comparing with the benchmark DDPG and TD3 algorithms, SDDPG-NAV exhibits better performance in terms of convergence rate, navigation performance, and generalization capability.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85181560082&origin=inward,IEEE Internet of Things Journal,2024
Path Planning for Heterogeneous UAVs With Radar Sensors,"Due to their flexibility and agility, unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) offer a promising approach to cluster planning within wireless sensor networks (WSNs). However, the limited battery capacity of a single UAV limits its application in many situations, such as searching in wild areas. In this article, we propose a computational scheme of cooperative path planning for heterogeneous UAVs based on Voronoi diagrams and intelligent swarm optimization algorithm. In this article: 1) Voronoi diagrams are used to model the field environment according to the radar sensor position; 2) an improved  $K$ -medoids algorithm based on the maximum empty circle property of the Voronoi diagram (Vor- $K$ -medoids) is proposed to complete the reconnaissance UAVs (RUAVs) domain cooperative search; and 3) a hyperbolic tangent heuristic function intelligent optimization algorithm is proposed to calculate the minimum risk path for the attack UAV (AUAV) according to the characteristics of the attack mission. The simulation results show that the proposed scheme integrates the properties of the Voronoi diagram, clustering algorithm, and path planning algorithm commendably. Compared with the traditional ant colony optimization (ACO), under the same number of iterations, the probability of obtaining the optimal track is improved by 14%, and the running time is shortened by 50.87%.The proposed scheme offers a practical and cost-effective approach for efficiently searching areas within large-scale radar sensors in real-world scenarios.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=10287106,IEEE Internet of Things Journal,2024
Lightweight Blockchain-Enhanced Mutual Authentication Protocol for UAVs,"With the rapid increase of data from unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), the security and privacy of data presents a severe challenge for UAV-based applications. Moreover, UAVs with constrained resources cannot be equipped with strong but complicated cryptographic primitives for authentication protocol design. Although some attempts have been made to deal with security and privacy issues for UAVs, most of the existing studies have been found numerous security vulnerabilities or own extreme communication/computation overheads. This article offers a lightweight and practical mutual authentication protocol solely comprised of bitwise XOR operations and one-way hash functions. Moreover, blockchain technology is utilized to alleviate the centralized trusted party (TA) issue. Then, security of our proposed authentication protocol is proved by widely adopted formal security proof—Real-or-Random model and informal security proof. The experimental results prove that the proposed protocol can achieve better security requirements (e.g., decentralized TA, replay attack defense, and session key security) with less communication cost (i.e., reduced by around 58.7% at most) and computation cost (i.e., reduced by around 98.9% at most) than related UAV authentication schemes.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85174854455&origin=inward,IEEE Internet of Things Journal,2024
Security and Reliability Tradeoff of UAV Relays Assisted Cognitive Transmissions With Hardware Impairments,"In this article, we analyze the security and reliability tradeoff (SRT) performance of a unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) relays assisted cognitive network consisting of a cognitive source (S), multiple cognitive UAV relays (Rs), a cognitive destination (D) in the face of an eavesdropper (E). We consider a practical scenario where mutual interference exists between the primary users and cognitive users. In order to protect the wireless transmission against the eavesdropping attack, we propose two UAV relay selection schemes, namely, noninterference aware relay selection (NIARS) scheme and interference aware relay selection (IARS) scheme. Specifically, in the NIARS scheme, a relay having the best instantaneous (R-D) link (spanning from Rs to D) is selected to forward message. By contrast, a relay maximizing the main channel capacity is selected, which relies not only on the channel state informations (CSIs) of main links but also on the CSIs of the interference links. For the purpose of comparison, we present the round robin (RR) scheme as a baseline. To evaluate the SRT performance, we derive the closed-form intercept probability (IP) and outage probability (OP) expressions for RR, NIARS, and IARS schemes under the impact of hardware impairments (HIs) over Nakagami- $m$  fading channels. Numerical results show that the proposed IARS and NIARS schemes perform better than RR scheme in terms of SRT performance. Additionally, the HI at D has a negative impact on SRT performance, while HI at E has a positive impact on SRT performance.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85176354524&origin=inward,IEEE Internet of Things Journal,2024
3-D UAV Small Cell Base Station Positioning and Resource Allocation in Cellular Network: A Stochastic Optimization Approach,"Integrating unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) into wireless communication as aerial platforms to mount small cell base stations has grown rapidly in recent years. One of the main objectives of UAV integration into wireless networks is to optimize UAV deployment while meeting user expectations with the fewest UAVs. To ensure that users receive the requested data rate, management of UAV placement and user association is necessary due to the limited capacity of aerial base stations. Besides the user-base station distance, environmental conditions and propagation mode affect the data rate received by the users. When accounting for uncertain conditions, network management decisions become more realistic and productive. This article considers a random propagation mode for each link depending on the environmental conditions of the desired area. We exploit the stochastic programming framework to reflect propagation mode uncertainty in the optimization problem, which impacts the received data rate and path loss. The suggested mathematical formulation determines the minimum number of required UAVs, their 3-D positions, and the best user association strategy. The proposed model also includes interference-aware constraints for optimal radio resource allocation to base stations. The nonlinear path loss and line-of-sight (LoS) probability distribution functions in terms of the base station positions lead to a nonlinear formulation. We obtain a mixed-binary linear formulation by replacing nonlinear functions with their piecewise linear approximations and solve the model accurately using the CPLEX solver. The implementation results show that stochastic approaches provide more accurate diagnoses of the environment, as well as superior performance to deterministic optimization.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=10310032,IEEE Internet of Things Journal,2024

Virtual-Mobile-Agent-Assisted Boundary Tracking for Continuous Objects in Underwater Acoustic Sensor Networks,"Aquatic environments confront mounting threats from diverse sources, among which the persistent migration of continuous objects (e.g., chemical contaminants) is a primary concern. While advances have been made in tracking these entities using underwater acoustic sensor networks (UASNs), full-scale monitoring is challenged by unpredictable sensor deployments. Though Autonomous underwater vehicles show promise, their prohibitive costs and operational complexities limit their broad adoption. To tackle these issues, this article introduces a novel search strategy named virtual mobile agent-assisted continuous object tracking (VMA-COT). Drawing inspiration from binary tree structures, VMA-COT refines the search from the entire network to targeted hierarchical boundary mapping cells. Each cell encompasses a Section of the object’s boundary. A designated node within each cell evaluates information entropy at specified locations using a meticulously designed search sequence. By utilizing a feedback mechanism, grounded in the information entropy and the search sequence, VMA-COT progressively pinpoints the boundary. This methodology can be likened to a central node dispatching mobile agents in each cell. These agents, limited by a specific step range, adjust their trajectories for precise boundary delineation. Empirical tests and simulations demonstrate the effectiveness of VMA-COT, highlighting its efficiency, accuracy, and boundary node utilization.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85174821773&origin=inward,IEEE Internet of Things Journal,2024
"Toward a Sustainable Internet of Underwater Things Based on AUVs, SWIPT, and Reinforcement Learning","Life on Earth depends on healthy oceans, which supply a large percentage of the planet’s oxygen, food, and energy. However, the oceans are under threat from climate change, which is devastating the marine ecosystem and the economic and social systems that depend on it. The Internet of Underwater Things (IoUT), a global interconnection of underwater objects, enables round-the-clock monitoring of the oceans. It provides high-resolution data for training machine learning (ML) algorithms for rapidly evaluating potential climate change solutions and speeding up decision making. The sensors in conventional IoUT are battery powered, which limits their lifetime, and constitutes environmental hazards when they die. In this article, we propose a sustainable scheme to improve the throughput and enable wireless charging of underwater networks, enabling them to potentially operate indefinitely. The scheme is based on simultaneous wireless information and power transfer (SWIPT) from an autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV) used for data collection. We model the problem of jointly maximizing throughput and harvested power as a Markov decision process (MDP), and develop a model-free reinforcement learning (RL) solution. The model’s reward function incentivises the AUV to find optimal trajectories that maximize throughput and power transfer to the underwater nodes while minimising its own energy consumption. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first attempt at using RL for this application. The scheme is implemented in an open 3-D RL environment specifically developed in MATLAB for this study. The performance results show up 207% improvement in energy efficiency compared to those of a random trajectory scheme used as a baseline model.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85167401895&origin=inward,IEEE Internet of Things Journal,2024
Multiobjective Optimization of Space–Air–Ground-Integrated Network Slicing Relying on a Pair of Central and Distributed Learning Algorithms,"As an attractive enabling technology for next-generation wireless communications, network slicing supports diverse customized services in the global space–air–ground-integrated network (SAGIN) with diverse resource constraints. In this article, we dynamically consider three typical classes of radio access network (RAN) slices, namely, high-throughput slices, low-delay slices and wide-coverage slices, under the same underlying physical SAGIN. The throughput, the service delay, and the coverage area of these three classes of RAN slices are jointly optimized in a nonscalar form by considering the distinct channel features and service advantages of the terrestrial, aerial, and satellite components of acrshortpl SAGIN. A joint central and distributed multiagent deep deterministic policy gradient (CDMADDPG) algorithm is proposed for solving the above problem to obtain the Pareto-optimal solutions. The algorithm first determines the optimal virtual unmanned aerial vehicle (vUAV) positions and the interslice subchannel and power sharing by relying on a centralized unit. Then, it optimizes the intraslice subchannel and power allocation, and the virtual base station (vBS)/vUAV/virtual low Earth orbit (vLEO) satellite deployment in support of three classes of slices by three separate distributed units. Simulation results verify that the proposed method approaches the Pareto-optimal exploitation of multiple RAN slices, and outperforms the benchmarkers.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=10263617,IEEE Internet of Things Journal,2024
Flying IRS: QoE-Driven Trajectory Optimization and Resource Allocation Based on Adaptive Deployment for WPCNs in 6G IoT,"6G Internet of Things (IoT) is envisioned to provide large-scale network connections and high data transmission rates to satisfy the diverse needs of IoT nodes. The wireless powered communication network (WPCN) is the essential part of the future 6G IoT, which can provide nodes with reliable and efficient data and energy transmission. In complex environments, wireless power transmissions are inefficient due to transmission distance and obstacles. To address these concerns, we propose a novel quality of experience (QoE)-driven framework for aerial intelligent reflective surface (IRS)-assisted WPCN, which exploits the maneuverability of unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) to improve the network performance. In the framework, we construct a nonlinear satisfaction function to quantify the QoE and design an adaptive reflective units configuration scheme based on the QoE to reduce resource consumption (e.g., energy) while satisfying the QoE requirements. The optimization problem of maximizing average throughput is formulated by jointly optimizing the aerial IRS flight trajectory, node association variable, time slot allocation ratio, and IRS phase. The existence of coupling between optimization variables and the nonconvexity lead to the difficulty of solving the optimization problem directly. To effectively solve the above optimization problem, the block coordinate descent (BCD) algorithm is utilized to decompose the optimization problem into four subproblems to be solved separately. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed scheme can significantly enhance the throughput compared with other schemes.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=10272692,IEEE Internet of Things Journal,2024
Source Location Privacy Protection Algorithm Based on Polyhedral Phantom Routing in Underwater Acoustic Sensor Networks,"Based on the review of existing source location privacy protection technologies and research on underwater data transmission, numerous scholars have performed extensive work in the field of source location privacy protection. Further, current methods for protecting the source node location privacy in Internet of Underwater Things (IoUT), especially in underwater acoustic sensor networks (UASNs), suffer from several issues, including high data transmission energy consumption, short network lifespan, and inability to ensure data accuracy. Moreover, current common security research on UASNs considers only passive attacks and has fewer countermeasures for active attacks. To address these challenges, this article proposes a source location privacy protection algorithm based on polyhedral phantom routing in UASNs (PPR-USLP). First, the polyhedral phantom routing algorithm based on platonic solids is employed to introduce phantom nodes, which increases path diversity and protects the privacy of the source node, thereby thwarting passive attacks from adversaries and prolonging the life cycle of the network. Second, suitable relay nodes are selected by considering the peripheral status of the nodes, the data are collected by autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs) to reduce the waiting time of sensor nodes and reduce the energy consumption of data transmission. Furthermore, to ensure data integrity and defend against active attacks from adversaries, this article combines error correction coding, which enhances network resilience and security while improving throughput and achieving load balancing. The simulation results demonstrate that PPR-USLP exhibits favorable performance in terms of energy consumption, safety time, and data accuracy, effectively safeguarding the privacy of the underwater source locations.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85173001407&origin=inward,IEEE Internet of Things Journal,2024
Event-Based Guidance and Incremental Control with Application to Fixed-wing Unmanned Aerial Vehicle Perched Landing Maneuvers,"Considering the nonlinearity and unknown dynamics of fixed-wing unmanned aerial vehicles in perched landing maneuvers, an event-based online guidance and incremental control scheme is proposed. The guidance trajectory for perched landing must be dynamically feasible therefore an event-based trapezoidal collocation point optimization method is proposed. Introduction of the triggering mechanism for the rational use of computing resources to improve PL accuracy. Furthermore, a filter-based incremental nonlinear dynamic inverse (F-INDI) control with state transformation is proposed to achieve robust trajectory tracking under high angle of attack (AOA). The F-INDI uses low-pass filters to obtain incremental dynamics of the system, which simplifies the design process. The state transformation strategy is to convert the flight-path angle, AOA and velocity into two composite dynamics, which avoids the sign reversal problem of control gain under high AOA. The stability analysis shows that the original states can be controlled only by controlling the composite state. Simulation results show that the proposed scheme achieves high perched landing accuracy and a reliable trajectory tracking control.",https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007/s10846-024-02063-w.pdf,Journal of Intelligent and Robotic Systems: Theory and Applications,2024

Towards Autonomous Firefighting UAVs: Online Planners for Obstacle Avoidance and Payload Delivery,"Drone technology is advancing rapidly and represents significant benefits during firefighting operations. This paper presents a novel approach for autonomous firefighting missions for Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs). The proposed UAV framework consists of a local planner module that finds an obstacle-free path to guide the vehicle toward a target zone. After detecting the target point, the UAV plans an optimal trajectory to perform a precision ballistic launch of an extinguishing ball, exploiting its kinematics. The generated trajectory minimises the overall traversal time and the final state error while respecting UAV dynamic limits. The performance of the proposed system is evaluated both in simulations and real tests with randomly positioned obstacles and target locations. The proposed framework has been employed in the 2022 UAV Competition of the International Conference on Unmanned Aircraft Systems (ICUAS), where it successfully completed the mission in several runs of increasing difficulty, both in simulation and in real scenarios, achieving third place overall.

In-Vehicle Digital Forensics for Connected and Automated Vehicles With Public Auditing,"Connected and autonomous vehicles produce a substantial amount of data that is essential for implementing advanced and intelligent features. Given the importance and the volume of in-vehicle data, storing it in the cloud for later extraction as critical evidence for vehicle digital forensics is a logical choice. However, ensuring the security of forensic data against tampering and forgery attacks throughout the process is a significant challenge. Existing solutions typically assume that vehicles will generate and upload the in-vehicle data to the cloud honestly. In reality, it may be necessary to prove whether the vehicle has uploaded authentic driving-related data in case of disputes about data authenticity. To address this issue, we propose an in-vehicle digital forensic scheme with public auditing, enabling anyone to perform a public auditing algorithm to check whether the data has been modified. The proposal is based on a process-oriented data integrity proof method that enables a vehicle to generate public verifiable integrity proof. Furthermore, we evaluated the practicality of our scheme by assessing its computational and communication overhead. In terms of computational cost, our proposed scheme demonstrates a power consumption of 0.0385 kWh per 100 km at a speed of 60 km/h. Regarding communication delay, our method exhibits a 50.1% decrease compared to similar approaches.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=10250783,IEEE Internet of Things Journal,2024

On the Physical Layer Security of Automotive Dual-Function Radar-Communication Systems,"The automotive industry has witnessed flourishing development in the last few years with the hope of achieving fully autonomous driving. In parallel, dual-function radar-communication (DFRC) systems are being developed to tackle the spectrum scarcity challenge and integrate radar and communication transceivers into a unified system. However, with a DFRC system, critical information may be intercepted by unauthorized people in the target vehicle. Therefore, the physical layer security of the DFRC system needs to be given considerable attention. To improve the security of information transmission, artificial noise (AN) is used to interfere with eavesdroppers. The main objective of this work is to maximize the secrecy rate of vehicles subject to both radar signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR) and communication transmit power constraints. To overcome the difficulty caused by the existence of the nonconvex Shannon capacity formula in the formulated problem, we convert the secrecy rate optimization to an equivalent bi-convex optimization problem. Furthermore, due to the nonconvexity of the formulated design problem, we exploit an inexact block coordinate descent (IBCD) algorithm based on semi-definite Programming (SDP) to obtain the optimal solution. Moreover, to reduce the complexity of the SDP-based IBCD algorithm, a bi-search-based IBCD algorithm is employed for single target scenarios. Finally, numerical simulations are used to demonstrate the superiority of using the AN approach to enhance the performance of the DFRC system in terms of the secrecy rate.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=10206037,IEEE Internet of Things Journal,2024
Outage Performance of Multitier UAV Communication With Random Beam Misalignment,"By exploiting the degree of freedom on the altitude, unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) communication can provide ubiquitous communication for future wireless networks. In the case of concurrent transmission of multiple UAVs, the directional beamforming formed by multiple antennas is an effective way to reduce co-channel interference. However, factors, such as airflow disturbance or estimation error for UAV communications, can cause the occurrence of beam misalignment. In this article, we investigate the system performance of a multitier UAV communication network with the consideration of unstable beam alignment. In particular, we propose a tractable random model to capture the impacts of beam misalignment in the 3-D space. Based on this, by utilizing stochastic geometry, an analytical framework for obtaining the outage probability in the downlink of a multitier UAV communication network for the closest distance association scheme and the maximum average power association scheme is established. The accuracy of the analysis is verified by Monte Carlo simulations. The results indicate that in the presence of random beam misalignment, the optimal number of UAV antennas needs to be adjusted to be relatively larger when the density of UAVs increases or the altitude of UAVs becomes higher.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85166305708&origin=inward,IEEE Internet of Things Journal,2024

Anchor-Free Multi-UAV Detection and Classification Using Spectrogram,"The advancements in unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) technology have brought immense convenience to society. However, unauthorized UAVs pose a serious threat to personal privacy, public safety, and aviation security. Therefore, accurate UAV detection and classification are crucial. Moreover, with the increased popularity of UAVs, the likelihood of multiple UAVs appearing in the same area simultaneously has also dramatically increased. Recent studies demonstrate that object detectors, such as FasterRCNN and YOLO, can be used to detect and classify multiple UAVs based on spectrograms. To our best knowledge, the object detectors are directly used to classify UAV without considering the characteristics of the UAV signal spectrogram, which results in a decrease in recognition performance. In this article, we analyze the characteristics of the UAV signal spectrogram in detail and conclude two problems, i.e., prior anchor mismatch and cross-domain detection, hindering the implementation of object detector for UAV recognition. To solve prior anchor mismatch, we propose an anchor-free detector based on keypoint and design a novel keypoints matching algorithm to improve recognition performance. To solve cross-domain detection, we propose an adversarial learning-based data adaptation method, which can generate domain-independent and domain-aligned features. Finally, the experiments adopt practical spectrogram and synthetic spectrogram to verify the superiority of the proposed anchor-free detector and the effectiveness of the proposed data adaptation method.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85168718680&origin=inward,IEEE Internet of Things Journal,2024
Adaptive Coding and Modulation-Aided Mobile Relaying for Millimeter-Wave Flying Ad Hoc Networks,"The emerging drone swarms are capable of carrying out sophisticated tasks in support of demanding Internet of Things (IoT) applications by synergistically working together. However, the target area may be out of the coverage of the ground station (GS) and it may be impractical to deploy a large number of drones in the target area due to cost, electromagnetic interference, and flight-safety regulations. By exploiting the innate agility and mobility of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), we conceive a mobile relaying-assisted drone swarm network architecture, which is capable of extending the coverage of the GS and enhancing the effective end-to-end throughput. Explicitly, a swarm of drones forms a data-collecting drone swarm (DCDS) designed for sensing and collecting data with the aid of their mounted cameras and/or sensors, and a powerful relay-UAV (RUAV) acts as a mobile relay for conveying data between the DCDS and a GS. Given a time period, in order to maximize the data delivered while minimizing the delay imposed, we harness an  $\epsilon $ -multiple-objective genetic algorithm ( $\epsilon $ -MOGA)-assisted Pareto-optimization scheme. Our simulation results demonstrate that the proposed mobile relaying is capable of delivering more data. As specific examples investigated in our simulations, our mobile relaying-assisted drone swarm network is capable of delivering 45.38% more data than the benchmark solutions, when a stationary relay is available, and it is capable of delivering 26.86% more data than the benchmark solutions when no stationary relay is available.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85165256514&origin=inward,IEEE Internet of Things Journal,2024
Pilot Assignment and Power Control in Secure UAV-Enabled Cell-Free Massive MIMO Networks,"This article investigates the pilot assignment and power control (PC) problems for secure unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) communications in a cell-free massive multi-input–multioutput network with the user-centric scheme, where numerous distributed access points (APs) simultaneously serve multiple UAVs and terminal users. Meanwhile, there exists one UAV acting as an eavesdropper which can perform pilot spoofing attack. Considering a mixture of Rayleigh and Rician fading channels, the APs, respectively, perform minimum mean-square error estimation and distributed conjugate beamforming for uplink training and downlink data transmission. Using the random matrix theory, the closed-form expression for a tight lower bound on the achievable secrecy rate is derived, which enables the impact analysis of key parameters, such as power, antenna configuration, UAV height, etc. Taking into account both performance and complexity, a novel pilot assignment scheme is proposed by combining the weighted graphic framework and genetic algorithm, which can actualize global search with limited iterations. The max–min PC with security constraints is then studied in parallel, which can not only enhance the network fairness but also ensure the security. Accordingly, successive convex approximation and fractional optimization are jointly utilized to solve this nonconvex problem. Simulation results numerically verify the analytical results and indicate the superiority of the proposed pilot assignment and PC schemes.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=10186455,IEEE Internet of Things Journal,2024
Secure Video Offloading in Multi-UAV-Enabled MEC Networks: A Deep Reinforcement Learning Approach,"Unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV)-enabled mobile-edge computing (MEC) has been widely applied in Internet of Things networks while the security risk of wireless computation offloading is still a challenging issue due to the openness nature of line-of-sight wireless channels between UAVs and edge devices (EDs). The existing secure offloading methods are not well targeted for video offloading in multi-UAV-enabled MEC networks since the joint potentiality of video distortion characteristics and multi-UAV flexible deployment in enhancing security is not exploited. In this article, we propose a secure video offloading strategy based on deep reinforcement learning (DRL) for a multi-UAV-enabled MEC system with a UAV eavesdropper. A joint optimization problem of resolution adjustment, offloading decision, computing capability allocation, communication resources orchestration, and multi-UAV position deployment is formulated to minimize system energy consumption under the constraints of offloading security, system latency, and users’ quality of experience from the aspect of video frame analytic accuracy. Since the formulated problem is a high-dimensional nonlinear mixed-integer NP-hard problem, it is difficult to obtain the optimal solution via traditional optimization methods. To solve it, we propose a DRL algorithm (HRF-TD3) to instruct the agent to approach the optimal solution efficiently. The simulation results show that the proposed algorithm is superior to comparison algorithms in terms of system energy consumption, EDs’ energy consumption, and system latency under the condition of wireless offloading security.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=10185964,IEEE Internet of Things Journal,2024
"IRS-Assisted Cognitive UAV Networks: Joint Sensing Duration, Passive Beamforming, and 3-D Location Optimization","In this article, to enhance the communication quality of cognitive unmanned aerial vehicle networks (CUAVNs), we investigate the intelligent reflecting surface (IRS)-assisted CUAVNs, where a leading UAV (LUAV) is deployed for sensing spectrum and a group of following UAVs (FUAVs) transmit data to LUAV with the aid of IRS. Our objective is to maximize the achievable throughput of CUAVNs by jointly optimizing sensing duration, IRS passive beamforming, and LUAV’s 3-D location, where LUAV’s 3-D location is restricted by IRS, FUAVs, and primary user. For the IRS-assisted single FUAV case, the intractable nonconvex optimization problem is resolved into three subproblems, which are solved by utilizing the bisection search method, the closed-form expression of the optimal IRS phase shift matrix and the successive convex approximation method, respectively. Finally, an efficient alternating optimization algorithm is developed to obtain a high-quality suboptimal solution. By exploiting the solutions of single FUAV, we further propose the throughput weighted sum (TWS) algorithm to solve the intricate nonconvex problem in IRS-assisted multiple FUAVs case. To further reduce the complexity of TWS, the low-complexity location weighted sum (LWS) algorithm is proposed. Numerical results show that compared to the scheme without IRS assistance, the achievable throughput increases about 102% with the proposed single FUAV scheme, and over 88% with the proposed TWS-based multiple FUAVs scheme. Moreover, the performance gap between the low-complexity LWS and the TWS is less than 7%.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=10177947,IEEE Internet of Things Journal,2024

TriBoDeS: A Tri-Blockchain-Based Detection and Sharing Scheme for Dangerous Road Condition Information in Internet of Vehicles,"Bad weather or environmental factors, particularly in remote mountain areas, may result in unsafe driving conditions and consequently road traffic accidents. As the deployment of large-scale sensing nodes for reporting road conditions is too expensive, the crowdsourcing method or reporting by sensors in vehicles themselves will be easier to deploy and more practical. However, those participant sensing methods impose some difficulties, such as fake information, reporter misbehavior, and timeliness. Thus, we propose a tri-blockchain-based Internet of Vehicles system, called TriBoDeS, to facilitate real-time information detection and sharing. It is designed to guarantee concurrency and security to dynamically store, manage, and share information uploaded by vehicles with great efficiency. Such information will be announced on the blockchain under the autonomous identification of vehicles in low-trust conditions. In order to ensure the software’s security, TriBoDeS can monitor the software’s state, detect identified malicious activities, and respond accordingly. To ensure data security, a role-based management mechanism is introduced to achieve fine-grained control over permissions, and confidence rules are established to guarantee the authenticity of the data. To demonstrate the applicability of the proposed scheme, we evaluate its performance (e.g., computing and communication overheads) and security (e.g., resiliency against common attacks) over a consortium blockchain. The experimental results demonstrate that, under the conditions of a sufficient number of vehicles, the TriBoDeS system is capable of real-time information sharing while ensuring the security of user information. Compared to conventional single-chain systems, the TriBoDeS system achieves a 2.75-time improvement in efficiency.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85165343776&origin=inward,IEEE Internet of Things Journal,2024

Application of PCA and Unsupervised Deep Learning in Bird and Drone Discrimination Based on FMCW Radar Measurements,"In low-altitude airspace surveillance, distinguishing between birds and drones is crucial due to their overlapping radar signatures. Radar, the preferred technology for long-range surveillance, struggles with this differentiation. To address this, our study introduces an unsupervised deep learning method utilizing real radar data from birds and unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs). This approach starts with data cleaning and upsampling using the synthetic minority oversampling technique (SMOTE) to manage dataset imbalance. We integrate principal component analysis (PCA) with deep learning to reduce the feature set efficiently. This integration minimizes computational demands while retaining essential information for precise clustering, enhancing real-world applicability. A deep clustering network (DCN) exploits the reduced-dimensional space created by PCA to identify distinct signal clusters for birds and drones, optimized for radar surveillance without relying on predefined labels. A deep neural network (DNN) maps data into a cluster-friendly hidden space, designed for radar signal analysis. The model’s effectiveness, with an average normalized mutual information (NMI) score of 0.878 through K-fold cross-validation, underscores the innovative potential of combining PCA with unsupervised learning. This method overcomes traditional radar techniques’ limitations, offering a scalable and efficient solution for surveillance scenarios.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=10736679,IEEE Geoscience and Remote Sensing Letters,2024
A Secure UAV Cooperative Communication Framework: Prospect Theory Based Approach,"Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) have attracted extensive attention from both industry and academia owing to their high mobility, line-of-sight (LoS) characteristics of air-to-ground (A2G) channels, and low cost. However, the broadcast nature of wireless transmission and the LoS characteristics of A2G channels are vulnerable to eavesdropping attacks, which leads to severe security issues. To enhance the security of UAV communication, we propose a framework that multiple UAVs cooperate to resist attacks (MURA). Specifically, we first introduce an efficient incentive scheme based on the coalition game to motivate UAVs to participate in a coalition. By forming a grand coalition, we demonstrate that each individual UAV can maximize its utility. Additionally, we propose a secure UAV communication scheme designed to counter eavesdropping attacks. Two distinct types of scenarios are considered in UAV communication. In a completely rational scenario, in which participants make decisions aiming to maximize their utility, we utilize the Stackelberg game to model the interactions between UAVs and attacker. The existence and uniqueness of the equilibrium solution are proved, and the equilibrium solution is obtained. In the context of an imperfectly rational scenario, we employ the prospect theory (PT) to effectively capture the underlying rationality exhibited by the players. The PT valuations of the players, i.e., UAV and attacker, are deduced in detail. Meanwhile, the convergence of the PT valuations of UAV and attacker is proved. Finally, extensive simulation results show that the proposed scheme can effectively improve the utility of legal UAVs and ensure the security of the UAV networks compared with benchmarks.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=10439615,IEEE Transactions on Mobile Computing,2024
Anti-Watermarking Stealthy Deception Attacks Against Networked Unmanned Surface Vehicles,"This paper investigates the problem of designing stealthy deception attacks against networked unmanned surface vehicles (USVs) equipped with watermarking detection modules.

Human-Vehicle Shared Steering Control for Obstacle Avoidance: A Reference-Free Approach With Reinforcement Learning,"Although artificial intelligence has made tremendous progress recently, there remain various technical issues and ethical problems before autonomous vehicles can be available to the general public. In the interim, collaboration between automated systems and human drivers becomes a promising solution, where the merits of machine intelligence and human intelligence are blended in a complementary way. To this end, the paper proposes a reference-free human-vehicle shared control framework based on reinforcement learning. Firstly, a personalized human-like driver agent is derived from highway driving data by means of generative adversarial imitation learning integrated with Gaussian mixture model. The driver model is responsible for real-time interaction with the reinforcement learning agent to relieve the burden of human operators in the course of training. Then, a copilot agent learns the policies to cooperatively control the vehicle steering based on three distinct implementations for the search of the best coordination strategy. Heuristic reward functions are designed to guide the agent policy optimization for multi-objective equilibrium between driver synchronization against intervention. To verify the control performance of the proposed shared driving system, simulation experiments with driver models and human-in-the-loop tests with real-life participants are conducted in the end of this paper. The results demonstrate that the shared steering control method can effectively follow human intentions, facilitate driving goals, improve road safety and reduce driver’s workload simultaneously in the challenging dynamic obstacle avoidance scenarios.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=10592663,IEEE Transactions on Intelligent Transportation Systems,2024
Mitigating Motion Sickness With Optimization-Based Motion Planning,"The acceptance of automated driving is under the potential threat of motion sickness. It hinders the passengers' willingness to perform secondary activities. In order to mitigate motion sickness in automated vehicles, we propose an optimization-based motion planning algorithm that minimizes the distribution of acceleration energy within the frequency range that is found to be the most nauseogenic. The algorithm is formulated into integral and receding-horizon variants and compared with a commonly used alternative approach aiming to minimize accelerations in general. The proposed approach can reduce frequency-weighted acceleration by up to 11.3% compared with not considering the frequency sensitivity for the price of reduced overall acceleration comfort. Our simulation studies also reveal a loss of performance by the receding-horizon approach over the integral approach when varying the preview time and nominal sampling time. The computation time of the receding-horizon planner is around or below the real-time threshold when using a longer sampling time but without causing significant performance loss. We also present the results of experiments conducted to measure the performance of human drivers on a public road section that the simulated scenario is actually based on. The proposed method can achieve a 19% improvement in general acceleration comfort or a 32% reduction in squared motion sickness dose value over the best-performing participant. The results demonstrate considerable potential for improving motion comfort and mitigating motion sickness using our approach in automated vehicles.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=10164221,IEEE Transactions on Intelligent Vehicles,2024
Resilient Cruise Control of Heterogeneous Platoons Against Byzantine Attacks: Theory and Experiment,"This article studies the problem of the resilient cruise control in heterogeneous vehicle platoons against f-local Byzantine attacks (BAs). Agents under BAs become traitors of the swarm, who try to mislead its neighbors while adopting wrong inputs. Thus, BAs are extremely challenging to be suppressed. This study introduces a novel hierarchical protocol characterized by a virtual twin layer (TL), motivated by the rationale of digital twin. This protocol separates the defense scheme against f-local BAs into two parts: one defense scheme against Byzantine edge attacks (BEAs) via the TL and another scheme against Byzantine node attacks (BNAs) via the cyber-physical layer (CPL). The TL employs a trusted-edge strategy, enhancing the network resilience by incorporating a minimal fraction of the key edges. It is rigorously proven that a TL topology meeting strong  $(2f+1)$ -robustness is sufficient for achieving distributed resilient estimation against BEAs. On the CPL, a series of decentralized chattering-free controllers is proposed, guaranteeing the resilient cruise tracking of heterogeneous platoons against exponentially unbounded BNAs. Besides, these controllers can achieve uniformly ultimately bounded convergence. The theoretical results’ effectiveness and practicality are validated through a numerical simulation example and an unmanned ground vehicle experiment involving heterogeneous platoons against f-local BAs.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85210540814&origin=inward,IEEE Transactions on Cybernetics,2024
L₂-Gain-Based Path Following Control for Autonomous Vehicles Under Time-Constrained DoS Attacks,"Autonomous vehicles (AVs) are being enhanced by introducing wireless communication to improve their intelligence, reliability and efficiency. Despite all of these distinct advantages, the open wireless communication links and connectivity make the AVs’ vulnerability to cyber-attacks. This paper proposes an  $L_{2}$ -gain-based resilient path following control strategy for AVs under time-constrained denial-of-service (DoS) attacks and external interference. A switching-like path following control model of AVs is first built in the presence of DoS attacks, which is characterized by the lower and upper bounds of the sleeping period and active period of the DoS attacker. Then, the exponential stability and  $L_{2}$ -gain performance of the resulting switched system are analyzed by using a time-varying Lyapunov function method. On the basis of the obtained analysis results,  $L_{2}$ -gain-based resilient controllers are designed to achieve an acceptable path-following performance despite the presence of such DoS attacks. Finally, the effectiveness of the proposed  $L_{2}$ -gain-based resilient path following control method is confirmed by the simulation results obtained for the considered AVs model with different DoS attack parameters.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=10596989,IEEE Transactions on Intelligent Transportation Systems,2024
Security Analysis for Autonomous Ground Vehicle Under Stealthy Sensor Attacks,"Lateral stability is a remarkably critical metric for the autonomous ground vehicle (AGV), and its loss is probable to cause a fatal accident. Various vehicular sensors, which play a key role in the lateral stability system, are coordinated to monitor the AGV's driving states. However, sensor attacks will inevitably push the AGV's lateral stability system into a insecure situation. In this paper, therefore, we investigate the security and insecurity conditions of the AGV under sensor attacks. Firstly, the dynamics output control protocol and the anomaly detector are developed in the lateral stability system. Then, we analyze the stealthiness of sensor attacks from the given detector's viewpoint. To describe how much the AGV is influenced by sensor attacks, we propose an equivalence condition associated with state variations. Besides, it is shown that internal states of the dynamics lateral controller are immune to stealthy sensor attacks. Secondly, we give a necessary and sufficient condition about the insecurity of AGV, which also motivates us how to design parameters to ensure cyber-security. Finally, we give a simulation to demonstrate the feasibility of the presented methodology. Specifically, we design a self-generated stealthy attack sequence, in which this sequence does not involve utilizing the system data in real-time.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=10502302,IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology,2024
Cybersecurity on Connected and Automated Transportation Systems: A Survey,"Connected and automated vehicles (CAVs) provide various valuable and advanced services to manufacturers, owners, mobility service providers, and transportation authorities. As a result, a large number of CAV applications have been proposed to improve the safety, mobility, and sustainability of the transportation system. With the increasing connectivity and automation, cybersecurity of the connected and automated transportation system (CATS) has raised attention to the transportation community in recent years. Vulnerabilities in CAVs can lead to breakdowns in the transportation system and compromise safety (e.g., causing crashes), performance (e.g., increasing congestion and reducing capacity), and fairness (e.g., vehicles fooling traffic signals). This paper presents our perspective on CATS cybersecurity via surveying recent pertinent studies focusing on the transportation system level, ranging from individual and multiple vehicles to the traffic network (including infrastructure). It also highlights threat analysis and risk assessment (TARA) tools and evaluation platforms, particularly for analyzing the CATS cybersecurity problem. Finally, this paper will provide valuable insights into developing secure CAV applications and investigating remaining open cybersecurity challenges that must be addressed.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=10292878,IEEE Transactions on Intelligent Vehicles,2024
A Practical and Provably Secure Authentication and Key Agreement Scheme for UAV-Assisted VANETs for Emergency Rescue,"Recently, unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) configured to provide real-time data for emergency rescue have been integrated into vehicular ad hoc networks (VANETs) to establish UAV-assisted VANETs. Because the communication channels between vehicles and UAVs are open and insecure, an authentication and key agreement (AKA) scheme is needed to secure such channels. Furthermore, a two-factor authentication mechanism is essential. However, most existing two-factor AKA schemes cannot achieve truly two-factor security while resisting password guessing attacks effectively. To address this problem, we propose a lightweight, provably secure, and practical two-factor AKA scheme for UAV-assisted VANETs based on chaotic maps by adopting techniques including fuzzy verifiers and honeywords. In this study, considering the limited computational storage of vehicles and UAVs, a hybrid generation algorithm is proposed to optimize the storage of honeywords. Through rigorous security proofs and detailed security analyses, we demonstrate that the scheme meets the security requirements of VANETs and can resist more security attacks. By utilizing the JPBC library to performance evaluation, a comprehensive comparison with related schemes reveals that the proposed scheme achieves a better balance between communication and computational overhead.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=10283995,IEEE Transactions on Network Science and Engineering,2024
Performance Degradation Estimation Mechanisms for Networked Control Systems Under DoS Attacks and its Application to Autonomous Ground Vehicle,"This article examines the mechanisms by which aperiodic denial-of-service (DoS) attacks can exploit vulnerabilities in the TCP/IP transport protocol and its three-way handshake during communication data transmission to hack and cause data loss in networked control systems (NCSs). Such data loss caused by DoS attacks can eventually lead to system performance degradation and impose network resource constraints on the system. Therefore, estimating system performance degradation is of practical importance. By formulating the problem as an ellipsoid-constrained performance error estimation (PEE) problem, we can estimate the system performance degradation caused by DoS attacks. We propose a new Lyapunov–Krasovskii function (LKF) using the fractional weight segmentation method (FWSM) to examine the sampling interval and introduce a relaxed, positive definite constraint to optimize the control algorithm. We also propose a relaxed, positive definite constraint that reduces the initial constraints to optimize the control algorithm. Next, we introduce an alternate direction algorithm (ADA) to solve the optimal trigger threshold and design an integral-based event-triggered controller (IETC) to estimate the error performance of NCSs with limited network resources. Finally, we verify the effectiveness and feasibility of the proposed method using the Simulink joint platform autonomous ground vehicle (AGV) model.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=10175196,IEEE Transactions on Cybernetics,2024

Security-Enhanced Data Sharing Scheme With Location Privacy Preservation for Internet of Vehicles,"Data sharing plays an important role in assisting traffic management centers to obtain traffic operation status and make accurate traffic decisions. However, there are still many security problems associated with data sharing, such as privacy breaches. To address these problems, we propose a security-enhanced data sharing scheme with location privacy preservation for Internet of Vehicles, called SEDS. Specifically, the scheme first exploits an autonomous and controllable dynamic pseudonym mechanism to protect the privacy of vehicles' location, thereby preventing the leakage of vehicle trajectory information. Secondly, SEDS utilizes homomorphic encryption to aggregate data at the edge of the network to achieve privacy protection of data content. Thirdly, SEDS uses batch verification with privacy protection to achieve integrity and authenticity of data, and can effectively filter false data. Finally, SEDS applies blockchain technology to store shared data, which can guarantee the immutability of shared data. The security proof and analysis show that SEDS has security features, containing confidentiality, location privacy, authentication and data integrity, filtering false data and immutability. Experimental results exhibit that the SEDS is superior to other recently proposed schemes in terms of computational and communication overhead, as well as network performance.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=10526410,IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology,2024
FedRSU: Federated Learning for Scene Flow Estimation on Roadside Units,"Roadside unit (RSU) can significantly improve the safety and robustness of autonomous vehicles through Vehicle-to-Everything (V2X) communication. Currently, the usage of a single RSU mainly focuses on real-time inference and V2X collaboration, while neglecting the potential value of the high-quality data collected by RSU sensors. Integrating the vast amounts of data from numerous RSUs can provide a rich source of data for model training. However, the absence of ground truth annotations and the difficulty of transmitting enormous volumes of data are two inevitable barriers to fully exploiting this hidden value. In this paper, we introduce FedRSU, an innovative federated learning framework for self-supervised scene flow estimation. In FedRSU, we present a recurrent self-supervision training paradigm, where for each RSU, the scene flow prediction of points at every timestamp can be supervised by its subsequent future multi-modality observation. Another key component of FedRSU is federated learning, where multiple devices collaboratively train an ML model while keeping the training data local and private. With the power of the recurrent self-supervised learning paradigm, FL is able to leverage innumerable underutilized data from RSU. To verify the FedRSU framework, we construct a large-scale multi-modality dataset RSU-SF. The dataset consists of 17 RSU clients and an additional 4 vehicle clients, covering various scenarios, modalities, and sensor settings. Based on RSU-SF, we show that FedRSU can greatly improve model performance in ITS and provide a comprehensive benchmark under diverse FL scenarios. To the best of our knowledge, we provide the first real-world LiDAR-camera multi-modal dataset and benchmark for the FL community.

Resilient Coverage by Teams of Quadrotor UAVs: Theory and Experiments,"We address the problem of coverage of a given environment by a team of quadrotor unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) with limited sensing capabilities. The objective is to develop a control strategy for spreading the UAVs across the environment for monitoring purposes. We do not assume the availability of a central controller for UAV coordination, and the UAVs cooperate by exchanging information via a communication network. By considering possible cyberattacks acting on the UAV network, we propose a resilient distributed control scheme such that the UAVs locally compute their position set points to achieve an overall coverage configuration despite the malicious behaviors of some attacked UAVs. By relying on the Voronoi diagram-based coverage technique, we first address possible attack scenarios that can deteriorate a covering mission. Then, we consider a generalized Voronoi diagram-based coverage scheme that shows resilience against cyberattack scenarios. We also design an adaptive control strategy ensuring the convergence of the UAVs to a desired coverage configuration, whereas the UAV parameters (inertial matrix, drag coefficient, and so on) are not known. Mathematical analysis, simulation, and real-world experimental results show the effectiveness of the proposed distributed resilient control scheme.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=10508966,IEEE Transactions on Control Systems Technology,2024

Intelligent Finite-Time Protocol-Based Stabilization for Networked UMV Systems With DoS Attacks,"This study concentrates on the finite-time protocol-based stabilization for networked unmanned marine vehicle (UMV) systems with denial-of-service (DoS) attacks. To save limited communication resources, a novel event-driven protocol is proposed, in which Q-learning mechanism is adopted to adjust the threshold of the driven condition intelligently. In light of aperiodic DoS attacks, the corresponding switched system is constructed in light of the average dwell time strategy. Employing switching Lyapunov functional, sufficient conditions are made for finite-time boundedness of the UMV systems with disturbance, respectively, in which the relationship among the DoS parameter, the triggered parameter, the finite-time parameter, and the sampling period is accurately characterized. Moreover, the co-design approach of driven parameter and controller gain is proposed for the corresponding UMV systems. Finally, the benchmark UMV systems are shown to verify the effectiveness of the proposed strategy.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85208691185&origin=inward,IEEE Transactions on Intelligent Transportation Systems,2024

Secure Sampled-Data Consensus of Multi-Agent Systems Under Asynchronous Deception Attacks With Application to Unmanned Surface Vehicles,"This paper studies the secure sampled-data consensus of multi-agent systems (MASs) under asynchronous independent deception attacks and multiplicative control gain disturbances by developing the looped Lyapunov-Krasovskii functional (LKF) approach. Because of the openness and shareability of communication network, as well as the time delay in the process of data transmission, two independent deception attacks with asynchronous phenomenon are considered in the sensor-to-controller (SC) and controller-to-actuator (CA) channel of MAS communication network. Furthermore, a coupled memory-based sampled-data control scheme is proposed and fractional-delay states on sampling intervals are introduced to construct an improved delay-dependent looped LKF. Therefore, a relaxed condition with lower conservatism is established to asymptotically ensure the secure sampled-data consensus of MASs in mean square under our designed control protocol. Finally, a simulation test applied to unmanned surface vehicles is conducted to validated the performance of designed control strategy.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=10328540,IEEE Transactions on Intelligent Transportation Systems,2024
A Secure and Efficient Data Sharing Scheme for UAV Networks: Integration of Blockchain and Prospect Theory,"Empowered by crowdsensing technology, unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) equipped with rich sensors can perform sensing tasks in extreme scenarios. However, due to the selfishness and distrust of UAVs, some malicious UAVs with insufficient resources may provide false sensing data to the task publishers. In addition, the centralized sensing platform is vulnerable to various attacks (e.g., data tampering attacks and single point of failure) in traditional crowdsensing, resulting in degraded data quality and severe security issues. To cope with these problems, we propose a blockchain-based crowdsensing framework with reputation incentive (BCFR) for UAV-assisted mobile crowdsensing. Specifically, a reputation-based incentive scheme is first proposed to relate the behavior of each UAV with its reputation, and then to choose UAVs with high reputation to perform sensing tasks, thereby improving the security of sensing data sharing. Afterwards, we design a blockchain-based secure data transmission scheme to securely record data transactions of UAVs. Furthermore, UAVs may be reluctant to perform compute-intensive mining tasks due to their limited computing capabilities. Therefore, a two-stage Stackelberg game is introduced to motivate UAVs to participate in the block creation process. In a more realistic scenario, where participants are bounded rational, prospect theory (PT) is utilized to capture the potential subject perceptions of UAVs. Finally, simulation results and security analysis demonstrate that the proposed BCFR scheme can effectively improve the probability of successful mining and ensure the security of data sharing.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85186989299&origin=inward,IEEE Transactions on Network Science and Engineering,2024

Robot Unknown Objects Instance Segmentation Based on Collaborative Weight Assignment RGB–Depth Fusion Strategy,"Unknown objects instance-aware segmentation (UOIS) is crucial for the operation of autonomous robots, especially in unstructured scenes with unknown objects. As the primary data source types for robots, RGB and Depth are not fully exploited by existing studies due to the inherent information differences between RGB (2-D appearance) and Depth (3-D geometry). Therefore, it is challenging to fully exploit the features of both modalities to achieve segmentation for instances of unknown objects. This article proposes a collaborative weight assignment (CWA) fusion strategy for fusing RGB and Depth (RGB-D). It contains three carefully designed modules, motivational pixel weight assignment(MPWA) module, dual-direction spatial weight assignment (DSWA) module, and stepwise global feature aggregation (SGFA) module. Our method aims to adaptively assign fusion weights between two modalities to exploit RGB-D features from multiple dimensions better. On the popular Graspnet-1Bilion and WISDOM RGB-D robot operation datasets, the proposed method achieves competitive performance with state-of-the-art techniques, proving our approach can make good use of the information between the two modalities. Furthermore, we have deployed the fusion model on the AUBO i5 robotic manipulation platform to test its segmentation and grasping optimization effects oriented to unknown objects. The proposed method achieves robust performance through qualitative and quantitative analysis experiments.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85177088594&origin=inward,IEEE/ASME Transactions on Mechatronics,2024

An IoT-Based Deep-Learning Architecture to Secure Automated Electric Vehicles Against Cyberattacks and Data Loss,"In the realm of modern transportation, automated electric vehicles (AEVs) assume a seminal role in realizing the vision of intelligent and electrified mobility. The advancement of AEVs hinges on the utilization of smart Internet of Things (IoT) devices as indispensable components to propel their evolution. These devices not only amplify the operational capabilities of AEVs but also underpin their security in the face of escalating cyber threats. In this regard, this study proposes a novel IoT architectural paradigm, encompassing integration of model predictive control (MPC) and deep neural network (DNN) frameworks. The proposed architecture aims to enhance AEV performance, empowering them to counteract the disruptive impact of erroneous data intrusions that result from cyber breaches. To ensure the timely identification of potential threats without compromising privacy considerations, this study augments the framework to encompass trajectory prediction. This extension is achieved through dynamic programming (DP) to craft effective control strategies governing AEV motions, conjoined with DNNs adept in discerning deviations from projected behavioral norms within AEVs’ control signals. This cohesive symbiosis propels the expeditious detection of anomalies indicative of potential security breaches. As data privacy remains a paramount consideration, this work employs Homomorphic Encryption, enabling anomaly score computation on encrypted data, thereby upholding privacy standards. Various test scenarios are conducted to emphasize the effectiveness of the proposed IoT architecture with MPC, DP, and DNN to improve the performance of the AEV. The results attest that the proposed approach can tackle cyberattacks and data loss effectively which enhances the production process and decision making.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=10572004,"IEEE Transactions on Systems, Man, and Cybernetics: Systems",2024

Although deep learning models for 3D perception give promising results, recent research demonstrates that they are also vulnerable to adversarial attacks similar to deep learning models trained on 2D images. As a result, it is essential to further explore the vulnerabilities of 3D perception models in autonomous vehicles and find methods to cope with the risks associated with these adversarial vulnerabilities, in order to improve the social acceptance of commercial autonomous vehicles. This study aims to provide an in-depth overview of the recent adversarial attacks and countermeasures against 3D perception models on autonomous vehicles.

Distributed Fault-Tolerant Consensus Control of Vehicle Platoon Systems With DoS Attacks,"Vehicle platoon systems are regarded as autonomous vehicles in the platooning pattern, in which vehicles drive in sequence and maintain the desired inter-vehicle spacing. This paper investigates the platoon control problem of vehicle platoon dynamics under cyber-physical threats through the distributed fault-tolerant consensus control protocol. Complicated sensor and actuator faults in the physical layer and aperiodic denial-of-service (DoS) attacks in the cyber layer are modeled, respectively. Decentralized fault-estimation unknown input observers and event-triggered distributed anti-DoS-attack fault-tolerant consensus controllers are devised in a co-designed framework, thus maintaining not only the tolerance and resilience of platoon consensus errors and estimation errors but also the secure vehicle avoidance spacing by virtue of attack frequency and average dwelling time indicators.

Adapting Image Classification Adversarial Detection Methods for Traffic Sign Classification in Autonomous Vehicles: A Comparative Study,"Autonomous driving systems critically depend on accurately classifying traffic signs, a task that is jeopardized by adversarial attacks. This paper focuses on the relatively unexplored domain of Traffic Sign Classification (TSC) in the context of detecting adversarial attacks. We conduct a rigorous evaluation of six prominent adversarial example detection methods, each representing a distinct detection category and well-regarded within the research community. Our methodology involves adapting these techniques, originally developed for general image classification (IC), to the unique challenges posed by traffic sign images, characterized by their complexity due to factors like varying environmental conditions and a large number of classes. Our study reveals insights into their effectiveness, with the Natural Scene Statistics (NSS) method outperforming others with 83.42%, 86.42%, and 99.96% detection rates; 0.08%, 0.05%, and 0.04%, false positive rates; and 0.02sec, 0.01sec, and 0.02sec detection times for Chinese, Belgium and German traffic sign datasets, respectively. NSS’s superiority is crucial for autonomous vehicles. Our study also sheds light on the often-neglected aspect of detection time in IC, which plays a vital role in ensuring operational efficiency and safety for autonomous vehicles. Our research highlights the need for customized defense strategies tailored to the TSC domain, considering our evaluation’s findings. By identifying promising techniques for detecting adversarial attacks in TSC, we contribute to enhancing the safety and robustness of autonomous driving systems. This study fills a critical knowledge gap, providing valuable insights into understanding and defending against adversarial attacks, specifically in the TSC context.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=10623847,IEEE Transactions on Intelligent Transportation Systems,2024
Fooling Decision-Based Black-Box Automotive Vision Perception Systems in Physical World,"Autonomous vehicles use deep neural networks (DNNs) to build powerful vision perception systems, which provide a theoretical foundation for automated vehicle control. Due to the inherent vulnerability of DNNs, many research works have implemented white-box attacks against automotive vision perception systems in the physical world. However, successful black-box attacks (especially decision-based) in the physical world are rarely mentioned because it is difficult to implement a physical-world adversarial attack without internal knowledge about the vision perception systems. In this paper, we propose PRAD, an end-to-end framework that transfers the existing decision-based black-box adversarial attack algorithms (as the backbone of the framework) targeting the digital domain to the physical world for the first time. Specifically,  $T(\cdot)$  is first introduced to simulate the real environment changes, e.g., angle, distance, slight shaking, illumination, etc. Then, and crucially, PRAD bridges the non-differentiable black-box attack and the differentiable  $T(\cdot)$  by the  $L_{1}$  loss function. We use the traffic sign recognition system in the vision perception system as an object to conduct comprehensive experiments, including different environmental conditions, black-box attack backbones, models, and datasets. The results demonstrate that the generated adversarial examples in the decision-based black-box setting can fool the commercial traffic sign recognition system into outputting designated misclassifications with high success rates and strong robustness in the physical world (average 90% in target attacks and nearly 100% in non-target attacks), which outperforms the state-of-the-art homogeneous attack methods.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=10397075,IEEE Transactions on Intelligent Transportation Systems,2024
Multi-Sensors Space and Time Dimension Based Intrusion Detection System in Automated Vehicles,"Recent developments in intelligence technologies have led to an explosion in the use of connected and automated vehicles (CAVs). Unfortunately, these autonomous vehicles face an increasing risk of vulnerability due to various attacks. Vehicle intrusion detection mechanisms are widely employed to mitigate the threats. Although some works have addressed this issue, few works consider situations that the attack detection may be fooled via simultaneous attacking multiple sensors. In this article, we propose a novel intrusion detection system integrated Space Dimension Model and Time Dimension Model based on sensor data fusion for countering both independent attack and confederate attack in automated vehicles. In Space Dimension Model, the correlations of multivariate in-vehicle sensor data among multiple sensors are utilized as the input of our optimized convolutional neural network (CNN) model. Especially, we construct vehicle state matrices to characterize the underlying correlation of data between each sensor and other sensors, and then input them into our network for classification. To describe the abrupt deviation caused by anomalous multivariate sensor data itself, we design Time Dimension Model to capture the sensor behaviors of vehicle state vectors at adjacent time by utilizing the Mahalanobis distance (MD) metric. Extensive empirical studies based on a real-world vehicular dataset demonstrate the effectiveness of our integrated anomaly detection mechanisms by a comparative analysis with two detection models that consider only Space Dimension and Time Dimension respectively. The method can outperform the related work under different scenarios 1) with the gain of up to 3.01% in accuracy and 3.04% in F1 score; 2) with ability of defending against confederate attack effectively.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=10224320,IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology,2024
Sparsely Connected Low Complexity CNN for Unmanned Vehicles Detection-Sensing RF Signal,"Unmanned aerial systems, namely drones, have greatly improved and expanded drastically over the years. Due to their efficiency and ease of use, drones have been utilized in a wide range of applications. Despite various potential uses, drones are also being utilized for illegal operations and exposing security threats to citizens. It is vital to install an effective anti-drone system to identify and defend against intruding malevolent drones to protect national security. Although there has been tremendous advancement in the development of machine learning to deploy lightweight architectures in the sensor industry, no such drone detection approach has yet been described in the literature. Therefore, this paper proposed a lightweight convolution neural network (CNN), namely RFDNet, to investigate the problem of 17 types of drone RF fingerprint classification problems in the low SNR regime. The network is configured with two principle modules, which are leveraged by the grouped and depth-wise convolution layers, incorporating accuracy improvement while keeping the complexity low. Notably, most existing networks fail to outstandingly detect drones at low SNR levels because the RF signal envelope is distorted and the transient information is lost in the noise. To solve this issue, we collected an open-source RF dataset that stores 17 types of drone RF signals at 30 dB SNR. To investigate the RF dataset at various SNR levels, we regenerate the dataset at different SNRs (i.e., $-10$ dB to 30 dB SNR with the 5 dB interval) and analyze the performance of the proposed network. The empirical results show that RFDNet performed outstandingly compared to the existing deep learning-based drone detection methods and achieved an overall 99.07% accuracy at 15 dB signal-to-noise ratio (SNR).",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=10584148,IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology,2024
Analytical Characterization of Cyberattacks on Adaptive Cruise Control Vehicles,"While automated vehicles (AVs) are expected to revolutionize future transportation systems, emerging AV technologies also open the door for malicious actors to compromise intelligent vehicles. As the first generation of AVs, adaptive cruise control (ACC) vehicles are particularly vulnerable to cyberattacks. Although recent efforts have been made to understand the impact of attacks on transportation systems, little work has been done to systematically model and characterize the malicious nature of these attacks. In this study, we develop a general framework for modeling and synthesizing two types of candidate attacks on ACC vehicles: direct attacks on vehicle control commands and false data injection attacks on sensor measurements, with explicit characterization of their adverse effects. Based on linear stability analysis of car-following dynamics, we derive analytical conditions that characterize the malicious nature of potential attacks. This ensures a higher degree of realism in modeling attacks with adverse effects, as opposed to simply considering constant or random attacks. The conditions derived provide an effective method for synthesizing strategic candidate attacks on ACC vehicles. We conduct extensive simulations to examine the impacts of intelligently designed attacks on microscopic car-following dynamics and macroscopic traffic flow. Numerical results illustrate the attack mechanism, offering useful insights into understanding the vulnerability of future transportation systems. The methodology developed allows for further study of the widespread impact of strategically designed attacks on traffic cybersecurity, inspiring the development of efficient attack detection techniques and advanced vehicle controls.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85208710594&origin=inward,IEEE Transactions on Intelligent Transportation Systems,2024
RPAU: Fooling the Eyes of UAVs via Physical Adversarial Patches,"Recently, Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) deployed with deep learning models have been widely applied both in civil and military. However, the vulnerability of the deployed model to adversarial attacks has raised security concerns. Previous studies have mainly explored adversarial attacks in the digital domain. While physical attacks have posed a more serious threat to UAVs. In this paper, we have explored a novel Robust Physical Attack against UAVs named RPAU, which directly threatens the flight safety of UAVs. Specifically, three attacks are proposed in RPAU: Hiding Attack (HA), Yaw Attack (YA), and Obstacle Attack (OA). To launch the attacks, we overcome three domain-design challenges, including continuous perturbation, digital-physical domain gap, and optimum perturbation generation. For continuous perturbation, we have introduced a nested patch that realizes attacks at any distance. Further, a series of transformations are considered to narrow the gap between the digital and physical domains. Then, we proposed a time-dependent mechanism for generating optimum perturbation. We conducted comprehensive experiments in the digital domain, simulation environment, and physical domain. The experimental results validate the robustness of the proposed framework. In the digital domain, RPAU outperforms the baseline by 54.9% average attack success rate (ASR).

USAF-IoD: Ultralightweight and Secure Authenticated Key Agreement Framework for Internet of Drones Environment,"The use of Internet of Drones (IoD) technology has surged across various domains such as logistics, surveying, industrial inspections, emergency response, security, infrastructure monitoring, crop management, and more. However, real-time communication with drones or Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) in the IoD environment occurs over an insecure open channel, making it susceptible to various security and privacy vulnerabilities, including unauthorized access, data interception, denial of service attacks, and privacy concerns. Due to their unique characteristics, including long transmission distances, unstable communication environments, resource limitations, and the highly dynamic nature of UAVs, ensuring the security and privacy of IoD systems is of paramount importance for the success of IoD-based applications. Furthermore, drones are resource-constrained devices, and employing expensive security solutions is impractical, as it would significantly reduce the operational capacity of drones. In this paper, we present the design of an ultralightweight, secure, and robust user-authenticated key agreement framework for the IoD environment, named USAF-IoD. The proposed USAF-IoD is developed by incorporating authenticated encryption (ASCON), cryptographic hashing, XOR operations, and the use of physical unclonable functions (PUFs). PUFs are employed to enhance resistance against physical tampering attacks. The security analysis reveals that the proposed USAF-IoD meets the essential security requirements of the IoD environment. The comparative analysis further highlights the effectiveness of the proposed USAF-IoD, notably excelling in terms of security and functionality characteristics when compared to existing benchmark schemes, and showcasing competitive performance in computation, communication, and energy overheads.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=10465668,IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology,2024
Distributed Data-Driven Control for a Connected Autonomous Vehicle Platoon Subjected to False Data Injection Attacks,"In this paper, we consider the need for deployment in the long-distance safe longitudinal formation control task when the connected autonomous vehicle (CAV) platoon is subjected to malicious cyber attacks. To ensure the safe, orderly, stable and efficient driving performance of the vehicle platoon, a novel distributed data-driven control (DDDC) approach for a homogeneous connected autonomous vehicle platoon under false data injection (FDI) attacks is investigated. First, an FDI attacks detection and compensation mechanism is designed to detect whether the received position signals are under attack or not and compensate the attacked position signals. Then, a novel DDDC approach for the vehicle platoon longitudinal formation control is developed by using the compensation data from the designed attack compensation mechanism and a dynamic linearization data model. Theoretical analysis verifies that the proposed DDDC method can ensure the internal stability (IS) and string stability (SS) of the homogeneous platoon subjected to FDI attacks. Finally, the effectiveness and practicality of the proposed DDDC approach are validated through a group of comparative simulations subjected to random FDI attacks of equal frequency and magnitude. Note to Practitioners—This work aims to solve the vehicle platoon long-distance safe longitudinal formation control task subjected to malicious FDI attacks. FDI attacks can achieve their destructive purposes by processing intercepted information and injecting false data into the original information. Existing literature overly relies on a priori knowledge of network attacks, yet in practice it is difficult to capture the true intentions of attackers in advance. For multi-channel V2V communication networks, it is even more important to design a resilient and accurate distributed controller strategy for such unpredictable and specific network attacks. Therefore, this paper proposes a data-driven distributed longitudinal formation control strategy with attack detection and compensation mechanism. The proposed strategy is shown to be able to ensure the safe longitudinal formation control task for the homogeneous CAV platoon suffering from FDI attacks. In addition, the stability of the CAV platoon is then investigated while the attacked signals are detected and cleaned, and it is shown to guarantee the internal stability of a single vehicle and the string stability of the platoon.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=10374098,IEEE Transactions on Automation Science and Engineering,2024
Neural-Network-Based Adaptive Fault-Tolerant Cooperative Control of Heterogeneous Multiagent Systems With Multiple Faults and DoS Attacks,"In this article, the issue of adaptive fault-tolerant cooperative control is addressed for heterogeneous multiple unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) and unmanned ground vehicles (UGVs) with actuator faults and sensor faults under denial-of-service (DoS) attacks. First, a unified control model with actuator faults and sensor faults is developed based on the dynamic models of the UAVs and UGVs. To handle the difficulty introduced by the nonlinear term, a neural-network-based switching-type observer is established to obtain the unmeasured state variables when DoS attacks are active. Then, the fault-tolerant cooperative control scheme is presented by utilizing an adaptive backstepping control algorithm under DoS attacks. According to Lyapunov stability theory and improved average dwell time method by integrating the duration and frequency characteristics of DoS attacks, the stability of the closed-loop system is proved. In addition, all vehicles can track their individual references, while the synchronized tracking errors among vehicles are uniformly ultimately bounded. Finally, simulation studies are given to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85162618973&origin=inward,IEEE Transactions on Neural Networks and Learning Systems,2024
Time-Series Anomaly Detection in Automated Vehicles Using D-CNN-LSTM Autoencoder,"It is reasonable to expect Connected and Automated Vehicles (CAVs) to revolutionize the intelligent world owing to the swapping of seamless and real-time data. Although CAVs provide many benefits to the environment and society, new challenges in term of security, privacy, and safety are emerged by anomalies, errors, cyber-security attacks, or malicious activities that led to accidents with fatal victims. This paper tackles the anomaly detection problem by introducing a novel framework in multi-sensor CAVs, which applies an efficient data preprocessing and deep learning method. In this paper, two preprocessing methods have been used and compared in the deep learning based models. The main contributions of this paper compared to previous works include two fundamental tasks. First, the quality of time series data is improved in the preprocessing phase by Differencing (DIFF) or Moving Standard Deviation (MSD). Second, the applied deep learning method is based on an autoencoder where a combination of Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) is utilized as the autoencoder architecture, which is referred to as D-CNN-LSTM Autoencoder in this paper. The D-CNN-LSTM Autoencoder method optimizes the anomaly detection rate for all of the anomalies, specifically in the case of low magnitude anomalies, enhancing F1-score up to 18.12% in single types of anomalies and 32.83% in mixed types of anomalies. The experimental results indicate the superiority of the proposed method for time series anomaly detection over the state-of-the-art and benchmark methods.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=10480743,IEEE Transactions on Intelligent Transportation Systems,2024
Fusion-Based Event-Triggered H∞ State Estimation of Networked Autonomous Surface Vehicles With Measurement Outliers and Cyber-Attacks,"This paper investigates the fusion-based event-triggered  $H_{\infty} $  state estimation of autonomous surface vehicles (ASVs) against measurement outliers and cyber-attacks. To release communication burden, a novel fusion-based event-triggered mechanism (FETM) dependent on the fusion of historical system outputs is proposed. There exist two advantages of this mechanism: 1) the use of fusion signal is able to avoid the information loss between two sampling instants and reduce the redundant triggering events resulted from system disturbances and noises; 2) by requiring the error signal in the triggering condition not only lager than a lower threshold but also less than an upper threshold, the false triggering events incurred by measurement outliers also can be discarded. Then, a time-varying delay system is established to represent the event-triggered  $H_{\infty} $  state estimation error system with network-induced delays. Then, sufficient conditions are deduced for solving  $H_{\infty }$  estimator gain and triggering matrix of FETM. Lastly, some simulation results are given to illustrate the merits of the theoretical method.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=10403530,IEEE Transactions on Intelligent Transportation Systems,2024
Adaptive SNDO-STSM Hierarchical Robust Control of Autonomous Underwater Vehicle: Theory and Experimental Validation,"This article mainly investigates the depth tracking problem for an underactuated autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV), considering system dynamic uncertainties and unknown external disturbances. First, a three-layer hierarchical control system is developed for the underactuated AUV, enhancing system flexibility and control performance. Second, an adaptive line-of-sight guidance law is presented, which estimates the attack angle and mitigates the influence of unknown disturbances on the guidance layer. Third, a finite-time control law based on second-order sliding-mode algorithm is proposed along with a modified sliding surface-based nonlinear observer for approximating complex uncertainties. This provides additional robustness to overcome intense transient impact. Furthermore, the sensitivity to precise modeling and the chattering phenomenon in actuators are relaxed. In addition, an adaptive saturation compensator is given to overcome the adverse effects caused by control input saturation constraints without singularities. Finally, the proposed hierarchical control system is validated in practice based on a lightweight AUV prototype. Comparative experiments are conducted under the influence of various types of complicated time-varying disturbances. The experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness and advantages of the proposed control system in practical scenarios.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=10480575,IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics,2024
ODFa${}^{2}$: Overall Defense Framework Against Cyber-Attacks on Intelligent Connected Vehicles,"Autonomous driving, as an emerging technology, is developing rapidly. However, a number of obstacles appear to be holding back the widespread adoption of autonomous driving. Cybersecurity issues, which have a significant impact both technically and psychologically on people's willingness to use autonomous driving, are one of the most significant barriers. Attackers have adopted increasingly diverse threat methods, increasing cyber-attacks. Despite these threats, global standards have been developed for road vehicle safety and cybersecurity. These standards are intended to guide manufacturers of automotive systems. For instance, the ISO and SAE have jointly released the international standard ISO/SAE 21434 (Road Vehicles—Cybersecurity Engineering) for road vehicle cybersecurity. However, focusing on the development of onboard systems alone when examining the application of these standards is not sufficient. Currently, we lack a methodology to directly apply the ISO/SAE 21434 standard to automotive system engineering projects. In particular, the overall framework of cybersecurity design for intelligent connected vehicle systems needs to be developed. This paper proposes an overall cybersecurity assurance framework (ODFa${}^{2}$) based on the ISO/SAE 21434 standard to assist system engineers in understanding security risks, evaluating the feasibility of attack implementation, and determining the trade-off methods for security countermeasures. We illustrate through a case study how this model-based framework may be applied to cybersecurity engineering in intelligent connected vehicles and mobility service platforms. Furthermore, the results of comparative experiments indicate that the proposed strategy optimization algorithm outperforms existing algorithms in terms of time efficiency under certain conditions.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=10366872,IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology,2024
AutoSMC: An Automated Machine Learning Framework for Signal Modulation Classification,"The electromagnetic environments have become more complex with the development of wireless communication technology. Signal modulation classification has attracted extensive attention due to its application in electronic countermeasures and physical layer security threat prevention under complex electromagnetic environments. Excellent classification performance requirements challenge the adaptability of the method and the ability to extract modulation characteristics. This paper proposes an automated machine learning framework, AutoSMC, for signal modulation classification. An adaptive signal augmentation method is proposed to adapt to the network changes during the search process. In order to extract the modulation features effectively, an scalable convolutional random fourier feature block is proposed. Moreover, the initial search space of the framework is given. The Bayesian Optimization is used to drive hyperparameter optimization to achieve AutoSMC and obtain the optimal method state. Great experiments were carried out on RADIOML 2016.10A and RADIOML 2016.10B. Experimental evaluations on these datasets show that our approach AutoSMC achieves state-of-the-art results compared to the most relevant signal modulation classification methods.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=10556687,IEEE Transactions on Information Forensics and Security,2024
DOEPatch: Dynamically Optimized Ensemble Model for Adversarial Patches Generation,"Object detection is a fundamental task in various applications ranging from autonomous driving to intelligent security systems. However, recognition of a person can be hindered when their clothing is decorated with carefully designed graffiti patterns, leading to the failure of object detection. To achieve greater attack potential against unknown black-box models, adversarial patches capable of affecting the outputs of multiple-object detection models are required. While ensemble models have proven effective, current research in the field of object detection typically focuses on the simple fusion of the outputs of all models, with limited attention being given to developing general adversarial patches that can function effectively in the physical world. In this paper, we introduce the concept of energy and treat the adversarial patches generation process as an optimization of the adversarial patches to minimize the total energy of the “person” category. Additionally, by adopting adversarial training, we construct a dynamically optimized ensemble model. During training, the weight parameters of the attacked target models are adjusted to find the balance point at which the generated adversarial patches can effectively attack all target models. We carried out six sets of comparative experiments and tested our algorithm on five mainstream object detection models. The adversarial patches generated by our algorithm can reduce the recognition accuracy of YOLOv2 and YOLOv3 to 13.19% and 29.20%, respectively. In addition, we conducted experiments to test the effectiveness of T-shirts covered with our adversarial patches in the physical world and could achieve that people are not recognized by the object detection model. Finally, leveraging the Grad-CAM tool, we explored the attack mechanism of adversarial patches from an energetic perspective.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=10695140,IEEE Transactions on Information Forensics and Security,2024
PhaDe: Practical Phantom Spoofing Attack Detection for Autonomous Vehicles,"Despite their prevalence and indispensability in the perception modules of autonomous vehicles, cameras have shown susceptibility to numerous attacks. Among them, the phantom spoofing attack is of significant concern. In such attacks, malefactors employ electronic display devices like projectors and display monitors to generate deceptive objects, thereby duping the object detectors in autonomous vehicles. However, existing detection methodologies are narrowly focused on a single device category, ignoring the multitude of devices that could be leveraged for attacks. Furthermore, the artificial modality-based solution presently in use lacks efficacious fusion mechanisms. In response to these limitations, we propose PhaDe, a practical deep learning-based system adept at detecting phantom spoofing attacks from a variety of and even unfamiliar attack devices. Our approach introduces two image processing techniques to construct artificial modalities and further advances a multi-head self-attention MSA-based fusion module for more versatile integration of disparate modalities. To boost the generalization capacity of our system against novel, unseen attacks, we incorporate two representation-level losses to align feature distributions from various domains. Evaluations conducted on our own dataset, encompassing fake objects from several device types, attest to the efficacy of our system. Our results indicate an accuracy of 98.80% on familiar domains and a detection success rate of 94.03% on unfamiliar domains. Additionally, PhaDe demonstrates a swift response time, fulfilling the practicality requisites.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=10466616,IEEE Transactions on Information Forensics and Security,2024

Latency-Free Driving Scene Prediction for On-Road Teledriving With Future-Image-Generation,"Teledriving could serve as a practical solution for handling unforeseen situations in autonomous driving. However, the latency of transmission networks remains a prominent concern. Despite advancements like 5G networks, delays in remote driving scenes cannot be entirely eradicated, potentially leading to unwanted incidents. While a few attempts have been made to address this issue by predicting the future driving scenes, these efforts have been restricted in their ability to accurately foresee clear and relevant driving scenarios. This study presents a method to predict a latency-free future driving scene. Unlike prior approaches, our method incorporates the command signal of a remote driver into the prediction network, as well as the past driving video frames and vehicle status. As a result, we can accurately predict relevant and clear latency-free future driving scenes. A combination of convolutional long short-term memory (ConvLSTM) and generative adversarial networks (GAN) was utilized in a deep neural network to predict the future driving scenes based on latency. The dataset was gathered from on-road teledriving experiments, with a maximum vehicle speed of 53 km/h and a driving route length of approximately 1.3 km. The dataset used to train the deep neural network was gathered from on-road teledriving experiments. The proposed method can estimate the future driving scene for up to 0.5 s, surpassing the performance of both baseline video prediction methods and a method that does not utilize the input command of the driver.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85205786053&origin=inward,IEEE Transactions on Intelligent Transportation Systems,2024
Lane Segmentation Data Augmentation for Heavy Rain Sensor Blockage Using Realistically Translated Raindrop Images and CARLA Simulator,"Lane segmentation and Lane Keeping Assist System (LKAS) play a vital role in autonomous driving. While deep learning technology has significantly improved the accuracy of lane segmentation, real-world driving scenarios present various challenges. In particular, heavy rainfall not only obscures the road with sheets of rain and fog but also creates water droplets on the windshield or lens of the camera that affects the lane segmentation performance. There may even be a false positive problem in which the algorithm incorrectly recognizes a raindrop as a road lane. Collecting heavy rain data is challenging in real-world settings, and manual annotation of such data is expensive. In this research, we propose a realistic raindrop conversion process that employs a contrastive learning-based Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) model to transform raindrops randomly generated using Python libraries. In addition, we utilize the attention mask of the lane segmentation model to guide the placement of raindrops in training images from the translation target domain (real Rainy-Images). By training the ENet-SAD model using the realistically Translated-Raindrop images and lane ground truth automatically extracted from the CARLA Simulator, we observe an improvement in lane segmentation accuracy in Rainy-Images. This method enables training and testing of the perception model while adjusting the number, size, shape, and direction of raindrops, thereby contributing to future research on autonomous driving in adverse weather conditions.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=10504424,IEEE Robotics and Automation Letters,2024
SAFENESS: A Semi-Supervised Transfer Learning Approach for Sea State Estimation Using Ship Motion Data,"Autonomous vessels have been identified as a promising innovation in advancing marine transportation, providing an effective means to mitigate the risk of accidents, pollution incidents, and carbon dioxide emissions. Accurate sea state estimation (SSE) plays a critical role in facilitating onboard decision-making and optimizing operational efficiency for autonomous ships. Traditional SSE approaches relying on external sensors, such as wave buoys and wave radars, are limited by cost considerations. Model-based methods are highly relying on the understanding of human knowledge to ships. Data-driven models also provide promising solutions, but their generalization is low. To address this challenge, a semi-supervised transfer learning approach for SSE (SAFENESS) is proposed. The model is trained using sufficient data in the source ship and limited data from the target ship and finally applied to the target ship. A data alignment algorithm is utilized to use the limited data of the target ship. To enhance the learning capability of the framework, two attention mechanisms are proposed, and a multi-class adversarial discriminator is introduced that can align the distributions of different domains. The effectiveness of our approach is validated through comprehensive comparisons with eleven established transfer learning methods, demonstrating the superiority of our model. The competitiveness of the proposed attention modules is verified by comparing them with state-of-the-art attention modules. The significance of each component and the influence of key parameters have been thoroughly explored in the ablation and sensitivity analysis. Our method has potential applications in maritime safety, navigation, and operation optimization.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85181559831&origin=inward,IEEE Transactions on Intelligent Transportation Systems,2024
A PUF and Fuzzy Extractor-Based UAV-Ground Station and UAV-UAV Authentication Mechanism With Intelligent Adaptation of Secure Sessions,"It is crucial that communication between an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) and the ground station (GS) be secure, and both devices should mutually authenticate each other to ensure that an adversary cannot obtain communicated information. Moreover, dynamically adapting the session time of an authenticated session can decrease the idle time of a session and consequently reduce the window of opportunity for an adversary to interfere with the communication link. In light of these considerations, we design a physically unclonable function (PUF) and fuzzy extractor-based UAV-GS authentication mechanism called UAV Authentication with Adaptive Session (UAAS). In UAAS, both UAV-GS and UAV-UAV authentication are two-way. We use a Thompson Sampling (TS)-based approach to intelligently adapt the duration of a session. Both formal and informal security proofs are presented along with a computation and communication cost analysis to analyze the performance of UAAS. It is noted that UAAS is secure against various well-known attacks and has a lower communication cost than several baseline mechanisms. Due to the noise reduction that occurs in PUFs, the computational cost of UAAS is higher than that of baselines that ignore noise. Also, our simulation shows that UAAS significantly outperforms baselines when it comes to network performance.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=10146461,IEEE Transactions on Mobile Computing,2024
UGEN: UAV and GAN-Aided Ensemble Network for Post-Disaster Survivor Detection Through ORAN,"Post-disaster scene understanding frameworks are increasingly crucial in Search And Rescue (SAR) operations. Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) provide an efficient means to carry out the task of scene understanding due to the higher altitudes at which they function. However, complex environments in post-disaster scenarios make it difficult for UAVs to detect humans or objects accurately. Inefficient object detection mechanisms lead to low accuracy for object detection tasks. Hence, to mitigate these issues, we propose a UAV and GAN-aided Ensemble Network (UGEN) framework for efficient ORAN-based post-disaster survivor detection. This approach deploys a Context-Conditional Generative Adversarial Network (CCGAN)-based model to remove occlusion in the images obtained from the UAVs. The UGEN framework classifies entities present in the visual scope of the UAV using a semantic segmentation framework deployed on the CCGAN-enhanced images, resulting in a pixel-level prediction of entities present in the post-disaster images. An ensemble network comprising a combination of single-stage and multi-stage detectors detects survivors present in the post-disaster scenario, thereby combining the benefits of both architectures, resulting in a reduced false negative rate and improved performance. An Open Radio Access Network (ORAN) executes data propagation between the UAV and the ground station for reduced transmission latency. The proposed model achieved a survivor detection accuracy of 96.7%.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=10380459,IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology,2024
Privacy-Driven Security-Aware Task Scheduling Mechanism for Space-Air-Ground Integrated Networks,"To implement ubiquitous intelligence of the sixth generation mobile networks (6G), space-air-ground integrated networks (SAGIN) have emerged as a promising infrastructure to provide globally seamless coverage and powerful cloud computing services. With SAGIN, Internet of Things (IoT) devices can offload compute-intensive tasks to unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) and satellites. However, due to the vulnerability of wireless communications to eavesdropping attacks, privacy-preserving task scheduling in SAGIN is of great challenge. To address this problem, we propose a privacy-driven multi-agent proximal policy optimization-based security-aware SAGIN task scheduling mechanism, where we jointly optimize the delay, energy consumption and security utility of tasks considering different privacy protection needs. In this mechanism, privacy protection is accomplished from two aspects. First, the privacy level of tasks and the privacy leakage risks of the communication link are fully considered in the selection of the scheduling destination. Second, we employ cryptography techniques and conceive an optimal encryption configuration scheme to achieve the most cost-effective privacy protection. Moreover, a convex optimization method is utilized to allocate CPU-cycle frequencies for computing services. In the end, simulation results demonstrate that our proposed algorithm outperforms other benchmarks in terms of convergence speed, offloading overhead and security utility of IoT devices.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=10506576,IEEE Transactions on Network Science and Engineering,2024
Wildfire Detection Powered by Involutional Neural Network and Multitask Learning With Dark Channel Prior Technique,"Wildfires are crucial to the ecosystem health, yet wildfires also pose a grave threat to human lives and the environment. Early detection remains challenging, especially in remote areas. Satellite data and autonomous aerial vehicles (AAVs) have become crucial tools for detecting and monitoring wildfires. Achieving proper identification is demanding due to the intricacy of wildfires, which are impacted by various environmental factors. Recent advances in remote sensing data analysis, especially the use of machine learning models, demonstrate captivating potential. Applying machine learning in remote sensing data analysis, this study examines state-of-the-art wildfire identification strategies based on the modified involutional neural network (Inv-Net). Inv-Net is used for wildfire segmentation and classification that enhances the U-Net architecture by incorporating the involutional neural network (INN) as its backbone. The INN layers dynamically perform kernel alterations, allowing for more efficient extraction of features and improved capture of spatial correlations. By utilizing the concept of multitask learning, Inv-Net achieves an accuracy of 98.1% in the classification task and exhibits a noteworthy Intersection over Union score of 97.6% in the segmentation task, notably when used for wildfire image analysis. To improve wildfire detection accuracy and resilience, Inv-Net uses the synergies between classification and segmentation. Furthermore, the dark channel prior (DCP) technique is used to address atmospheric disturbances such as haze and fog in static images. DCP reduces optical interference by estimating depth maps and transmission maps. The results highlight the importance of the DCP method, which achieves an excellent structural similarity index measure of 0.7831 and peak-signal-to-noise ratioof 17.4321, indicating greater image dehazing methods. In comprehensive trials and comparisons, we demonstrate the robustness of our approach in identifying and mapping wildfires in challenging conditions.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85202771346&origin=inward,IEEE Journal of Selected Topics in Applied Earth Observations and Remote Sensing,2024
Provably and Physically Secure UAV-Assisted Authentication Protocol for IoT Devices in Unattended Settings,"As the core subject of IoT applications, IoT devices have faced numerous security challenges. Especially for IoT devices deployed in remote or harsh environments, they are often unattended for long periods, making it difficult to share the sensing data and susceptible to potential physical attacks. While aerial assistance methods represented by unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) can solve the problem of data sharing at a low cost, it is necessary to establish a secure channel between ground control stations, UAVs, and IoT devices due to the sensitivity of the sensing data. Recently, Physical Unclonable Function (PUF) has been proven to provide unique identity identification for devices using its tamper-proof feature. In this paper, we propose a lightweight UAV-assisted authentication and key agreement protocol for unattended IoT devices, ensuring secure communication and physical tamper-proof requirements. However, our work does not stop there. We noticed that some existing PUF-based authentication schemes misunderstand the ability of PUF, which leads to these schemes cannot actually provide physical protection. We analyzed the security vulnerabilities of these schemes and proposed rules that should be followed when designing authentication protocols using PUF. In addition, for the first time, we put forward the formal definitions and proof methods for PUF in the formal proof of the security protocol, which avoided the unreasonable initial assumptions adopted in the proof of the existing schemes. We extended Mao-Boyd (MB) logic and comprehensively analyzed the proposed protocol. We also evaluate the performance of the proposed scheme, and the results show that the proposed scheme has certain advantages in communication and computation overhead compared with existing schemes.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=10476492,IEEE Transactions on Information Forensics and Security,2024
State Estimation Adaptable to Cyberattack Using a Hardware Programmable Bank of Kalman Filters,"Sensor-estimator systems provide critical information on the state of cyber-physical plants. Often, these units operate in an environment of constrained computational resources. This condition makes them vulnerable to cyberattacks that aim especially to degrade their processing capability and effectively incapacitate them. In the event that computational nodes are lost, an approach to adapt the estimator’s algorithm and reprogram the adapted form on the surviving hardware is presented. To prepare the sensor-estimator system for degradation, the following co-design steps are developed: 1) the estimation algorithm, a bank of Kalman filters (KFs), is distributed so that multiple elemental filters are implemented on a collection of field-programmable gate arrays (FPGAs) and 2) the matrix operations of the conventional KF are programmed on the FPGAs using Faddeeva’s elimination. After the attack, adaptation of the filter bank is realized by leveraging dynamic partial reconfiguration (DPR) of the surviving FPGAs. A high-authority agent monitors the likelihood of all elemental filters, a measure of which filters currently provide the best estimates, and replaces the least likely elements of the bank with the most likely ones. The latter are loaded onto the freed-up fabric of the remaining FPGAs, while these units are running other elemental filters in order to process sensor data without interruption. We have demonstrated their method on a prototype system that uses a radar sensor to estimate the kinematics of a maneuvering unmanned surface vehicle (USV).",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=10490234,IEEE Transactions on Control Systems Technology,2024
Light-Driven Micro/Nanorobot for Biomimetic Optical Communication,"Light sensing and communication represent a vital link in the progress of biological evolution, helping organisms to respond to their environment and carry out survival activities. To simulate this process and exploit it in engineering applications, we develop a light-driven micro/nanorobotic system. Like the natural defense mechanisms of biological vision, these robots can mimic the sensitivity and responsiveness of living organisms to light stimuli. Additionally, the development of nanotechnology and molecular communication (MC) caters to the trend of the Internet of Bio-Nano Things. However, there are still difficulties in conducting systematic research at the experimental level in related scientific fields. To bridge the gap between the simulation of MC with micro/nanorobots and the construction of an experimental testbed, a complete micro/nano-scale communication platform is built by using customized optical microscopy equipment. We use $\text{Cu}_{2}\text{O}$ micro/nanorobots to imitate the natural properties of molecules, since under negative phototactic motion they are suitable for being a message carrier in MC. This is similar to the behavior of visual organisms that receive external light stimuli and convert them into biomolecular signals. Information is transmitted by controlling the self-driving of the micro/nanorobots with in-situ signals. We propose three low-complexity threshold-based detectors to recover information from the received signal. Experimental results show that the light-driven micro/nanorobots can meet the requirements of multi-directional manipulation. Through the implemented miniaturized observation testbed coupled with light-driven micro/nanorobots, microparticle-based information transmission is accomplished by utilizing the properties of micro/nanorobots.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=10403968,IEEE Robotics and Automation Letters,2024
A Scheme for Protecting Source Location Privacy Based on Hierarchical Structure in Smart Ocean,"In the process of data acquisition of underwater acoustic sensor networks (UASNs), the safety of the network is threatened by the disclosure of source node location information. So how to protect the security and privacy of source node location is the main challenge faced by UASN security. To realize this taeget, a hierarchical structure-based algorithm for protecting source location privacy (HSSLP) is proposed in this paper. Firstly, it is proposed to divide UASNs into dynamic and static layers based on Ekman drift model. Location privacy protection schemes suitable for source nodes located in different layers have been proposed separately. In the static layer, k-means clustering separates the nodes into groups, and the source node’s location privacy is protected using fake source node and phantom nodes, while auxiliary cluster head and sleep scheduling mechanism are used to save node energy. Nodes in the dynamic layer, whose positions are prone to change, are no longer clustered. The source node makes use of inducing nodes to take adversaries away from the source node, enhancing the privacy and security of the source node with minimal energy expenditure. Finally, autonomous underwater vehicles (AUV) need to support the cluster head in collecting data combined in the static layer and data uploaded in the dynamic layer. Based on the communication range of AUV, the network is segmented into areas, and when the AUV receives warning messages while traveling, it changes its route to lead the adversary to an area remote from the source node. Simulation results show that the proposed algorithm owns the capacity to balance the relationship between network security, transmission delay, and node energy consumption. To be more specific, the HSSLP algorithm improves the safety time by about 50%, reduces the delay by about 20% and saves the node energy by about 36% as compared to the DIS-PLP algorithm.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=10417727,IEEE Transactions on Intelligent Transportation Systems,2024
Dehazed Image Quality Evaluation: From Partial Discrepancy to Blind Perception,"Nowadays, vision oriented intelligent vehicle systems such as autonomous driving or transportation assistance can be optimized by enhancing the visual visibility of images acquired in bad weather conditions. The presence of haze in such visual scenes is a critical threat. Image dehazing aims to restore spatial details from hazy images. There have emerged a number of image dehazing algorithms, designed to increase the visibility of those hazy images. However, much less work has been focused on evaluating the visual quality of dehazed images. In this paper, we propose a Reduced-Reference dehazed image quality evaluation approach based on Partial Discrepancy (RRPD) and then extend it to a No-Reference quality assessment metric with Blind Perception (NRBP). Specifically, inspired by the hierarchical characteristics of the human perceiving dehazed images, we introduce three groups of features: luminance discrimination, color appearance, and overall naturalness. In the proposed RRPD, the combined distance between a set of sender and receiver features is adopted to quantify the perceptually dehazed image quality. By integrating global and local channels from dehazed images, the RRPD is converted to NRBP which does not rely on any information from the references. Extensive experiment results on both synthetic and real dehazed image quality databases demonstrate that our proposed methods outperform state-of-the-art full-reference, reduced-reference, and no-reference quality assessment models. Furthermore, we show that the proposed dehazed image quality evaluation methods can be effectively applied to tune parameters for image dehazing algorithms and have the potential to be deployed in real transportation systems.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=10409541,IEEE Transactions on Intelligent Vehicles,2024
RSFVC: Robust Biometric-Based Secure Framework for Vehicular Cloud Networking,"Vehicular cloud networking (VCN) is a new study area that combines vehicular cloud computing (VCC) and information-centric networking. By utilizing VCC technologies, it is effectively use in road security and traffic control. The benefits of VCC in VCN are superior, including faster turnover times, scalability, flexibility, cost savings, greater collaborations, advanced security, the prevention of data loss, data security, minimal maintenance, limitless storage capacity, traffic information aggregation, etc. VCN is an intelligent networking system that manages autonomous traffic, system security, privacy, and vehicle control capabilities. During communication, various adversary types have the potential to compromise the security and privacy of these networks. To preserve their security, privacy, confidentiality, and integrity, such systems require an authentication framework. The paper presents an elliptic curve cryptography (ECC) and biometrics-based secure authenticated framework for VCN. The suggested protocol accomplishes all security, privacy, and other criteria for secure communications against active and passive attackers. It is also demonstrated, both formally and informally, that the proposed framework is secure, correct and efficient. The study further establishes, using the simulation tool AVISPA, that the proposed protocol is secure against man-in-the-middle and replay attacks. Additionally, the study uses BAN logic to demonstrate how the mutual authentication property is proven. In VCN, the proposed protocol efficacy is evaluated and compared to other similar protocols within the study. The results show that the proposed framework is secure and efficient in terms of computation and communication overheads. Consequently, the proposed protocol will be advantageous for VCN.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=10287859,IEEE Transactions on Intelligent Transportation Systems,2024
A Novel Machine Learning-Based Trust Management Against Multiple Misbehaviors for Connected and Automated Vehicles,"Connected and Automated Vehicles (CAVs) are exposed to various threats in the dynamic, open and multi-domain network. Applying machine learning-based trust management for CAVs becomes imperative to capture complex features and adapt to dynamic situations. To deal with multiple misbehaviors and real traffic scenarios challenges, a trust management method for CAVs is proposed with data fusion, trust factor computation and two-tier trust prediction. First of all, three types of features on CAVs are analyzed, including spatio-temporal logic features, behavioral features and traffic flow features. Then, data fusion methods that combine beacon messages with map and detector data are proposed to enhance trust-related data. A multi-dimensional trust factor computation approach is then introduced using statistical methods. Finally, per-minute and multi-minute machine learning-based trust prediction methods are performed at the node level using the computed trust labels from each beacon. The results showed the effectiveness and real-time capability of the data fusion process, as well as the completeness of the trust factor computation. The trust prediction results showed both high performance at the per-minute level with models like XGBoost and further improved performance at the multi-minute level with deep learning models.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85208739628&origin=inward,IEEE Transactions on Intelligent Transportation Systems,2024
Anti-Jamming Colonel Blotto Game for Underwater Acoustic Backscatter Communication,"Underwater acoustic backscatter communication, which allows an underwater sensor node (USN) to communicate with the surface sink node (SN) by reflecting the acoustic signal from the SN, is a promising solution for enabling the Internet of Underwater Things. However, underwater backscattering is vulnerable to jamming attacks, especially from a gliding autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV) that can inject jamming signal to the underwater acoustic channel accordingly. This article considers the attack-defense interactions between the AUV jammer and the SN defender in their transmit power allocations of jamming signals and acoustic signals over multiple USNs. We formulate the strategic power allocation problem for the SN and AUV as an asymmetric anti-jamming Colonel Blotto (CB) game model with a finite budget of total transmit powers. In particular, the competitive interactions between the SN and the AUV is modeled as the competition of two players in the game for limited resource budgets over the battlefield set. We analyze the mixed-strategy Nash equilibrium to the game, and obtain the closed-form performance bound of the defense power allocation strategy. Numerical results show the superiority of the proposed CB game based multi-USN secure transmission scheme as compared to the benchmarks in terms of the expected sum-utility.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=10440551,IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology,2024
Interval Type-2 Fuzzy Path Tracking Control for Autonomous Ground Vehicles Under Switched Triggered and Sensor Attacks,"This article focuses on the path tracking control problem for autonomous ground vehicles under switched triggered and sensor attacks. Firstly, an interval type-2 Takagi-Sugeno fuzzy model is established to effectively approximate the tire dynamic nonlinearities and varying velocity in the path tracking control system, in which the random deception attack encountered in the sensor is considered. Secondly, a novel switched triggered communication mechanism is presented to decrease the frequency of signal transmission and save the network resources. The switched triggered mechanism includes both the time-triggered mode and event-triggered mode, which obey a Bernoulli distribution. Then, based on a positive Lyapunov-Krasovskii functional and matrix inequalities, a set of conditions are developed for the path tracking controller design to achieve the asymptotic stability and performance requirements.

Joint UAV Deployment and Resource Allocation: A Personalized Federated Deep Reinforcement Learning Approach,"Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) are capable of serving as aerial base stations (BSs) for providing dynamic coverage and connectivity extension for the sixth-generation (6G) wireless networks. While flexibility is provided, the deployment of the UAV swarms and the associated resource allocation become rather challenging due to the dynamic nature of UAVs and difficulty in obtaining global user information. In this article, we propose an adaptive and flexible joint UAV deployment and resource allocation (JUDRA) scheme by exploiting personalized federated deep reinforcement learning, called PFRL, with aim to maximize the long-term network throughput while enforcing user privacy and adapting to time-varying network states. To allow UAVs to make real-time decisions on resource allocation and position adjustment based on local observations while achieving a global optimal solution, a deep reinforcement learning (DRL) algorithm is adopted in the federated learning framework in PFRL. Specifically, we use DRL to train a local model and a personalized model on UAVs, and employ a two-level parameter aggregation scheme on a leading UAV to form a global model. The personalized model can adapt to changing environments, while exploiting the generalization of global model to accelerate the learning convergence. Numerical results show that the proposed PFRL scheme can achieve significant performance gain in terms of network throughput and convergence in comparison with some state-of-art solutions.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=10334003,IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology,2024
Distributional Soft Actor-Critic-Based Multi-AUV Cooperative Pursuit for Maritime Security Protection,"Unauthorized underwater vehicles (UUVs) pose a serious threat to maritime security. To preserve maritime security, it is essential to pursue these UUVs. The majority of traditional pursuit methods are based on known environmental dynamics. However, the underwater environment is too complicated and unpredictable to describe these dynamics accurately. This study developed a novel online decision-making technique called multi-agent distributional soft actor-critic (MADA) to handle the issue of underwater cooperative pursuit. The method constructs a control-oriented framework based on multi-agent reinforcement learning that can map autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV) observations to pursuit actions. Multiple AUVs can combine to make prompt pursuit decisions. Then, the proposed method combines distributional soft actor-critic and curriculum learning to improve the success rates of multiple AUVs in pursuing UUVs. Experimental results show that the MADA can obtain a better cooperative pursuit strategy.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=10368092,IEEE Transactions on Intelligent Transportation Systems,2024
Extended Attribute Profiles for Precise Crop Classification in UAV-Borne Hyperspectral Imagery,"Unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV)-borne hyperspectral imagery has been applied in precision agriculture, owing to its high spatial and spectral resolution. Specifically, the high spatial resolution is conducive to revealing the textural characteristics of crops, while the high spectral resolution can depict detailed spectral differences among crops. In this study, we explored the potential of extended attribute profiles (EAP) in modeling the spectral-spatial characteristics of UAV-borne hyperspectral imagery for the precise crop classification. Specifically, two dimensionality reduction approaches, namely, principle component analysis (PCA) and independent component analysis (ICA), were performed on the hyperspectral image to extract components, based on which a series of EAP that measure different image characteristics are generated. To exploit the complementary information of different attributes, the extracted EAP were fused for the classification of crops using feature stacking (FS) and decision fusion (DF) strategies. Meanwhile, random forest (RF), support vector machine (SVM), and deep neural networks (DNN) were used as classifier for the precise classification of crops. Experiments conducted on the WHU-Hi dataset demonstrated that EAP exploited the spectral-spatial information of UAV-borne hyperspectral imagery and obtained satisfactory crop classification performance.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=10378649,IEEE Geoscience and Remote Sensing Letters,2024
Target Tracking With Circumnavigation Scheme Using Discrete Bearing and Control Input,"Exploiting proper controller and bearing-only measurement to perform the target tracking with unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) has become a popular trend due to the convenience of a single bearing sensor and the flexibility of UAVs. This article revisits the slowly moving target circumnavigation problem with UAV modeled as a first-order integrator, presenting results in three aspects. First, we focus on the problem with discrete bearing data and control input, illustrating the principle parameter conditions for system convergence. Second, a thorough convergence analysis from a different perspective for a typical algorithm is presented, resulting a more accurate conclusion upon the target-circumnavigation system convergence. Third, based on the estimation property, an algorithm that exploits the rough information of the target velocity is proposed, which significantly accelerates the estimation error convergence rate and improves the estimation performance. Simulation results are given that validate the conclusion that the estimation error and UAV distance can be unbounded when the target velocity is specially designed under common assumptions in the literature, which corrects the conclusion in the existing work, and also validates that the proposed algorithm possesses estimation performance obviously superior to that of existing algorithms, especially for situation with constant-velocity target.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=10476713,IEEE Transactions on Aerospace and Electronic Systems,2024
A Flexible Load Balancing Scheme in Multi-UAV-Enabled Wireless Networks,"Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) equipped with communication modules can act as mobile base stations. In this paper, we focus on load balancing in multi-UAV-enabled wireless networks, where UAVs serve ground user equipments (UEs) with time division multiple access (TDMA). The UEs have spatiotemporal heterogeneous requests to transfer data which need to be fulfilled in time, the unfinished part called unfinished user request. To improve the quality of service (QoS) and promote the overall system performance, we exploit the flexibility of UAVs to propose a flexible and efficient multi-UAV-enabled load balancing (MULB) scheme. Taking the load balancing effect into consideration, the network optimization problem is formulated as minimizing the maximum unfinished user request by jointly optimizing user association, UAV trajectory, and time slot allocation. Due to integer constraints and non-convexity, we exploit block coordinate descent (BCD) and successive convex approximation to solve it efficiently. Simulation results show that our proposed MULB scheme outperforms existing multi-UAV scheduling schemes in terms of not only the load balancing ability but also the overall system throughput.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85183958322&origin=inward,IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology,2024
Joint Scene Flow Estimation and Moving Object Segmentation on Rotational LiDAR Data,"LiDAR-based scene flow estimation (SFE) and moving object segmentation (MOS) are important tasks with broad-ranging applications in autonomous driving, such as traffic surveillance, motion analysis, obstacle avoidance, etc. Most existing works address SFE and MOS separately, ignoring the underlying shared geometric constraints and their inherent correlation. This article rethinks LiDAR-based SFE and MOS tasks, providing our key insight that jointly addressing them can tackle challenges in both tasks, and their solutions can reinforce one another to improve the performance of both. Based on this insight, we introduce a novel framework that exploits shared geometric constraints by explicitly partitioning the scene into static and moving regions and subsequently estimating flow differently for these regions. A lightweight and interpretable neural network dubbed SFEMOS is proposed. It employs an encoder and two specially designed head modules for each task, achieving MOS without relying on prior poses and online point-wise flow estimation for 360-degree point clouds. Due to the absence of public datasets for concurrently evaluating both tasks, we generate ground truth flow data using MOS labels from SemanticKITTI. Additionally, we establish a new dataset using a rotational LiDAR mounted on our own autonomous vehicle. Evaluation results on both datasets validate the superior performance of our proposed SFEMOS. Our dataset and label generation method are released at https://github.com/nubot-nudt/SFEMOS.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85208308872&origin=inward,IEEE Transactions on Intelligent Transportation Systems,2024
Designing Anonymous Key Agreement Scheme for Secure Vehicular Ad-Hoc Networks,"Presently, the Vehicular Ad-hoc Network (VANET) is very important for the entire traffic management system. The 5th Generation (5G) enables VANET and Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS) to connect devices in the million/sqkm range with improved performance, incredible transmission speed (terabit), and less cost to serve a vast, transformative, and diverse automobile sector. To ensure security and avoid the free flow of information in highly scalable, dynamic 5G, there are many challenges to restrict unauthenticated users access and proper key agreements with fine-grained access control. Here, a lightweight biometrics-based dynamic Anonymous Key Agreement Scheme (AKAS) with a fine-grained authentication feature is proposed to address challenges related to the restriction of unauthenticated users access and proper key agreement with fine-grained access control specifically for Vehicle-to-Vehicle (V2V) communication in VANET. In the proposed scheme, registered and authorized users can access services or information as per access privilege only. We have simulated our scheme using Automated Validation of Internet Security Protocols (AVISPA), Simulation of Urban MObility (SUMO), OMNET++ (Objective Modular Network Testbed in C++), and performed formal security analysis using the Real-or-Random (ROR) oracle model. Analysis and simulation results show that our scheme is secured against various well-known attacks. Further, we have compared the security and efficiency of our scheme with the existing schemes and found that our proposed protocol is more secure, lighter, 5G-friendly, scalable, and even faster than the other related schemes.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=10475132,IEEE Transactions on Intelligent Transportation Systems,2024
Flexible and Secure Cross-Domain Signcrypted Data Authorization in Multi-Platoon Vehicular Networks,"Autonomous Vehicle Platooning (AVP) presents a promising approach to reducing energy expenses, improving traffic safety, and enhancing capacity. In multi-platoon vehicular networks, platoons can collaborate to ensure better data transfer reliability. However, the existing secure information-sharing methods between platoons face efficiency and security challenges. These challenges arise from (1) a lack of an efficient method to simultaneously ensure confidentiality, authenticity, and non-repudiation of the transmitted information; (2) difficulty in cross-domain dynamically sharing ciphertexts to multiple recipients is challenging. To overcome these challenges, we propose a Flexible Cross-domain Data Access Control (FC-DAC) system in this paper. Our FC-DAC system ensures confidentiality, authenticity, and non-repudiation of transmitted information while enabling high-efficiency ciphertext sharing between various platoons. Additionally, the FC-DAC solution allows vehicles with valid authorizations to access signcrypted information quickly and efficiently, even if they belong to different platoons. Our theoretical and experimental analysis demonstrates that the FC-DAC scheme is resistant to various common attacks and is applicable to multi-platoon vehicular networks.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=10287852,IEEE Transactions on Intelligent Transportation Systems,2024
Action Robust Reinforcement Learning for Air Mobility Deconfliction Against Conflict Induced Spoofing,"Increased dynamic drone usage has increased complexity in aerial navigation and often demands distributed local deconfliction. Due to the high velocities and few landmarks, robust deconfliction relies on precise positioning and synchronization. However, intentional spoofing attacks aimed at inducing navigation conflicts threaten the reliability of conventional techniques. Here, we address these concerns by establishing a baseline on the impact of novel conflict-inducing spoofing attacks on existing geometric navigation methods. Based on the impact of the attacks on the navigation, reinforcement learning (RL) strategy is used to counter the effects of spoofing attacks. In order to counter the effect of spoofing in randomized dynamic airspace conditions, a zero-sum action-robust (ZSAR) RL based on mixed Nash equilibrium objective is used. The proposed methodology yields an improved number of conflict-free paths while reducing average conflicts compared to existing state of the art RL strategies, thus making it suitable for deploying autonomous aircrafts.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=10682497,IEEE Transactions on Intelligent Transportation Systems,2024
Connected and Autonomous Vehicles in Web3: An Intelligence-Based Reinforcement Learning Approach,"“Read-write-own” based Web3 has been proposed as a promising user-centric Internet to open the new generation of the World Wide Web, where Web3 users can independently manage data and derive value from creating content without relying on intermediaries. Connected and autonomous vehicles (CAVs) in Web3 can trade models in a self-controlled and decentralized credible way, which is a fundamentally and principally innovation based on novel architecture. Effectively implementing such paradigms involves proper model trading strategies. However, reinforcement learning (RL)-based strategies face challenges of poor generalization ability, low feasibility, and the exploration-exploitation dilemma. It is also difficult to define an explicit and appropriate reward function. Therefore, in this paper, we propose an intelligence-based reinforcement learning (IRL) approach for CAVs in Web3. We present a framework to enable model transactions between CAVs. Also, we provide a decentralized identifier (DID)-based identity management system for resource description and data verification to access Web3, followed by the mechanism and supporting smart contracts. Furthermore, we formulate the model trading issue as an active inference to form higher-level cognition about the environment without rewards. Then we use IRL to solve it. And we use “intelligence,” a high-level indicator, to quantify the efficiency of such cognition. It can evaluate the difference between the predicted state and the real state in policy exploration. The proposed scheme shows good generalization and can auto-balance exploration and exploitation, simultaneously achieving outperforming performance on the model trading issue with no rewards. In simulations, the performance of the proposed scheme is compared with existing methods.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=10417754,IEEE Transactions on Intelligent Transportation Systems,2024
Cooperative Multi-Agent Jamming of Multiple Rogue Drones Using Reinforcement Learning,"The wide adoption and use of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) has created not only opportunities but also threats to the security of sensitive areas. Thus, effective and efficient counter-drone systems are required to protect these areas. This work tackles this issue by developing cooperative multi-agent jamming techniques using reinforcement learning (RL) to counter the operation of one or multiple rogue drones flying over a sensitive area. The aim of the proposed RL approach is to optimize the joint mobility and power control actions of the pursuer UAVs in order to maximize the received jamming power at the rogue drones aiming at disrupting communication links and sensing circuitry, while at the same time keeping the interference to surrounding pursuer agents below a predefined threshold. The effectiveness of the proposed approach in terms of scalability, learning speed, and agents’ final joint performance is demonstrated through extensive simulation experiments for various agent and target configurations.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=10547296,IEEE Transactions on Mobile Computing,2024
Distributed Cooperative Strategy of UAV Swarm Without Speed Measurement Under Saturation Attack Mission,"In this article, a distributed cooperative strategy based on a saturation attack mission (SAM) with an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) swarm is investigated. Little research has been conducted in this area, especially in relation to aerial moving targets. First, the mathematical model of the UAV swarm and the problem of distributed fencing under SAM are established, respectively. Second, aimed at the target's defense system, a calculation model of assigned UAVs is designed to ensure that the minimum number of UAVs is required to carry out the mission. Then, considering one situation that the entire swarm is not loaded speed measurement and at least one UAV can detect the moving-target's position, a distributed cooperative control scheme without a preset formation is proposed. It includes a distributed position observer and a fencing controller, which inspired by swarm behaviors and consensus theory. Furthermore, the speed information of each UAV is replaced by introducing an auxiliary state. This controller realizes target-fencing without collision between UAVs. Finally, the effectiveness of the developed strategy is demonstrated through numerical simulations.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=10483291,IEEE Transactions on Aerospace and Electronic Systems,2024
Landmark-Based Vehicle Self-Localization Using Automotive Polarimetric Radars,"Automotive self-localization is an essential task for any automated driving function. This means that the vehicle has to reliably know its position and orientation with an accuracy of a few centimeters and degrees, respectively. This paper presents a radar-based approach to self-localization, which exploits fully polarimetric scattering information for robust landmark detection. The proposed method requires no input from sensors other than radar during localization for a given map. By association of landmark observations with map landmarks, the vehicle’s position is inferred. Abstract point- and line-shaped landmarks allow for compact map sizes and, in combination with the factor graph formulation used, for an efficient implementation. Evaluation of extensive real-world experiments in diverse environments shows a promising overall localization performance of 0.12m RMS absolute trajectory and 0.43° RMS heading error by leveraging the polarimetric information. A comparison of the performance of different levels of polarimetric information proves the advantage in challenging scenarios.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=10550060,IEEE Transactions on Intelligent Transportation Systems,2024
DopUS-Net: Quality-Aware Robotic Ultrasound Imaging Based on Doppler Signal,"Medical ultrasound (US) is widely used to evaluate and stage vascular diseases, in particular for the preliminary screening program, due to the advantage of being radiation-free. However, automatic segmentation of small tubular structures (e.g., the ulnar artery) from cross-sectional US images is still challenging. To address this challenge, this paper proposes the DopUS-Net and a vessel re-identification module that leverage the Doppler effect to enhance the final segmentation result. Firstly, the DopUS-Net combines the Doppler images with B-mode images to increase the segmentation accuracy and robustness of small blood vessels. It incorporates two encoders to exploit the maximum potential of the Doppler signal and recurrent neural network modules to preserve sequential information. Input to the first encoder is a two-channel duplex image representing the combination of the grey-scale Doppler and B-mode images to ensure anatomical spatial correctness. The second encoder operates on the pure Doppler images to provide a region proposal. Secondly, benefiting from the Doppler signal, this work first introduces an online artery re-identification module to qualitatively evaluate the real-time segmentation results and automatically optimize the probe pose for enhanced Doppler images. This quality-aware module enables the closed-loop control of robotic screening to further improve the confidence and robustness of image segmentation. The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed approach with the re-identification process can significantly improve the accuracy and robustness of the segmentation results (Dice score: from 0.54 to 0.86; intersection over union: from 0.47 to 0.78). Note to Practitioners—The Doppler signal is important for the diagnosis of vascular disease, e.g., peripheral arterial disease, in clinical practices, nevertheless it is not of similar significance for state-of-the-art robotic ultrasound (US) examination systems yet. This paper explores various neural network structures to effectively extract the blood vessels from US images by incorporating the Doppler signal into the segmentation process. The final DopUS structure with two encoders extracting differentiated information from two different inputs and fusing the latent feature representations in the bottleneck layer can also inspire other tasks like multi-senor fusion. In addition, this work developed a Doppler-based tracker to assess the quality of the segmentation results in real-time. The assessment is subsequently used for a quality-aware module that enables closed-loop control of the robotic screening. Preliminary physical experiments suggest that the quality-aware robotic screening system can improve the confidence and robustness of autonomous US examination results. In the future, the Doppler signal could also be used to support clinical diagnosis. We believe the proposed quality-aware autonomous screening system is important for the development of large-scale robotic US screening programs. It will not only benefit the examination of limb arteries but also other vascular structures, e.g., carotid or aorta.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=10152472,IEEE Transactions on Automation Science and Engineering,2024
Network-Based Modeling and Sampling Guaranteed Cost Control for Unmanned Surface Vehicle Systems Under Stochastic Cyber-Attacks,"The future extensive usage of continuous measurable communication network for output feedback control in unmanned surface vehicle (USV) will inevitably increase the control cost, waste energy, and even reduce the system performance under stochastic cyber attacks. However, the existing study largely ignores the guaranteed cost control of USV under stochastic cyber attacks. To fill the knowledge gap, this paper attempts to focus on the guarantee cost control of USV systems by taking into account the finite measurable output sampling information and stochastic cyber attacks. Initially, a point output sampling control strategy based on finite measurable output sampling information is proposed, which has a strong application background and important theoretical research value in the field of power grid security. On this basis, a new stochastic composite system containing both system state and output sampling information is developed. Subsequently, a sampling-time-dependent Lyapunov function (LYFU) is exploited to ensure the workable criteria of the cost sampling controller, which can not only stabilize the stochastic composite system by means of the mean square exponential stability, but also reveal the upper bound (UPBO) of the quadratic cost function (COFU). Specially, in the strict sensu of minimizing the UPBO of the COFU, a meaningful design method for a suboptimal guaranteed cost output sampling controller is designed, which is a modulus-related LMI optimization algorithm. Finally, numerical simulation results of USV and additional vehicle lateral motion model are developed to demonstrate the validity and rationality of the proposed design method.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85182928250&origin=inward,IEEE Transactions on Intelligent Transportation Systems,2024
SPR: Single-Scan Radar Place Recognition,"Localization is a crucial component for the navigation of autonomous vehicles. It encompasses global localization and place recognition, allowing a system to identify locations that have been mapped or visited before. Place recognition is commonly approached using cameras or LiDARs. However, these sensors are affected by bad weather or low lighting conditions. In this letter, we exploit automotive radars to address the problem of localizing a vehicle within a map using single radar scans. The effectiveness of radars is not dependent on environmental conditions, and they provide additional information not present in LiDARs such as Doppler velocity and radar cross section. However, the sparse and noisy radar measurement makes place recognition a challenge. Recent research in automotive radars addresses the sensor's limitations by aggregating multiple radar scans and using high-dimensional scene representations. We, in contrast, propose a novel neural network architecture that focuses on each point of single radar scans, without relying on an additional odometry input for scan aggregation. We extract pointwise local and global features, resulting in a compact scene descriptor vector. Our model improves local feature extraction by estimating the importance of each point for place recognition and enhances the global descriptor by leveraging the radar cross section information provided by the sensor. We evaluate our model using nuScenes and the 4DRadarDataset, which involve 2D and 3D automotive radar sensors. Our findings illustrate that our approach achieves state-of-the-art results for single-scan place recognition using automotive radars.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85198311443&origin=inward,IEEE Robotics and Automation Letters,2024
Game-Theoretic Human-Machine Shared Steering Control Strategy Under Extreme Conditions,"Human-machine shared control is a necessary transitional stage from manual to fully autonomous driving. A novel game-theoretic shared control strategy is proposed to ensure driving safety under extreme conditions. Specifically, a differential game framework is employed to mathematically model the dynamic human-machine interaction. The shared controller is developed based on the nonlinear vehicle dynamics and model predictive control (MPC). The piecewise affine (PWA) approach is utilized to linearly approximate the vehicle system and derive the Nash equilibrium solution of the game problem. Furthermore, a linear weighted shared driving strategy is designed to dynamically allocate the driving weight based on the level of driving risk and human-machine conflict. Simulation results in extreme conditions verify that the shared control strategy can fully exploit tire force to alleviate the driver's burden and compensate for the driver's misoperation, improving lateral stability.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=10272619,IEEE Transactions on Intelligent Vehicles,2024
Non-Intrusive Security Assessment Methods for Future Autonomous Transportation IoV,"The security of the Internet of Vehicles (IoV) has always been a concern. The constantly changing IoV data under varying traffic conditions made it unsuitable for the IoV to adopt traditional anti-attack techniques. In the absence of protections, attackers can use in-car communication as a target to compromise the safety of passengers, hence the instancy to detect the security state of the IoV. However, currently available solutions require modifications to the original hardware of the IoV and are therefore very limited in applicability. In this paper, we propose a security assessment method for IoV based on Microcontroller Unit (MCU) chip temperature, called SAMCT. Specifically, we first record the MCU chip temperatures of IoV device in different security states and analyze the relationship between them. Second, the fingerprint dataset is built using the temperature residuals. Third, to forecast the security standing of IoV devices, an integration regression model based on Self-Encoders is suggested. Lastly, in order to facilitate the effectiveness of the SAMCT, a Cloud-Edge-End framework is designed with the technology of model adaptive partitioning. Results from the experiments, which were carried out on the Raspberry Pi 4B and Stm32 hardware platforms, demonstrate that the Mean Squared Error (MSE) of the SAMCT is only 0.00104 and that the execution efficiency improvement under the Cloud-Edge-End framework is significant. Note to Practitioners—This paper was inspired by security concerns in Internet of Vehicles communication systems. The core of this work is to provide a novel security assessment method for IoV devices based on MCU temperature, which can detect the security status of IoV devices in real-time without modifying the original hardware. To this end, the different skills from scheme design to detection and validation are explained. One crucial part of this work is to regard the MCU temperature of the IoV device as a security reference and fully integrate the critical techniques in deep learning. In addition, the proposed scheme is universal and can be applied to various scenarios such as the autonomous driving and the industrial internet of things.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=10265253,IEEE Transactions on Automation Science and Engineering,2024
Pedestrian Crossing Intention Prediction Based on Cross-Modal Transformer and Uncertainty-Aware Multi-Task Learning for Autonomous Driving,"Accurate prediction of whether pedestrians will cross the street is prevalently recognized as an indispensable function of autonomous driving systems, especially in urban environments. How to utilize the complementary information present in different types of data (or modalities) is one of the major challenges. This paper makes the first attempt to develop a cross-modal transformer-based crossing intention prediction model merely using bounding boxes and ego-vehicle speed as input features. The cross-modal transformer can leverage self-attention and cross-modal attention to mine the modality-specific and complementary correlation. A bottleneck feature fusion is presented to obtain the compressed feature representation. To facilitate the network training, we further put forward a novel uncertainty-aware multi-task learning method that jointly predicts the future bounding box as well as crossing action such that the commonalities and differences across two tasks can be exploited. To evaluate the proposed method, extensive comparative experiments and ablation studies are performed on two benchmark datasets. The results demonstrate that by only using the bounding box and ego-vehicle speed as input features, our model is on a par with other state-of-the-art approaches that rely on more inputs, and even achieves superior performance in most cases. The source code will be released at https://github.com/xbchen82/PedCMT.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=10507743,IEEE Transactions on Intelligent Transportation Systems,2024
Distributed Platooning Control of Automated Vehicles Subject to Replay Attacks Based on Proportional Integral Observers,"Secure platooning control plays an important role in enhancing the cooperative driving safety of automated vehicles subject to various security vulnerabilities. This paper focuses on the distributed secure control issue of automated vehicles affected by replay attacks. A proportional-integral-observer (PIO) with predetermined forgetting parameters is first constructed to acquire the dynamical information of vehicles. Then, a time-varying parameter and two positive scalars are employed to describe the temporal behavior of replay attacks. In light of such a scheme and the common properties of Laplace matrices, the closed-loop system with PIO-based controllers is transformed into a switched and time-delayed one. Furthermore, some sufficient conditions are derived to achieve the desired platooning performance by the view of the Lyapunov stability theory. The controller gains are analytically determined by resorting to the solution of certain matrix inequalities only dependent on maximum and minimum eigenvalues of communication topologies. Finally, a simulation example is provided to illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed control strategy.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9938380,IEEE/CAA Journal of Automatica Sinica,2024
Blockchain-Based Efficient Access Control With Handover Policy in IoV-Enabled Intelligent Transportation System,"Recent advances in Internet technology and IoT devices have facilitated researchers to foster a wide range of Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS) that improve the quality of automated transportation by addressing real-time safety and traffic management issues. The participating ITS agents, such as smart cars and roadside equipment, are required to communicate urgently through an open (unsecured) wireless channel in an unattended setting. To address the security issues, several vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) and vehicle-to-infrastructure (V2I) authentication and access control protocols have been proposed in recent times. However, fast-moving vehicles need to set up frequent authentication with different roadside units, which induces high computation and communication overheads. Consequently, it becomes a bottleneck for the resource-limited vehicle onboard unit devices. As the blockchain supports decentralized storage with data integrity and transparency, in this article, we design a secure and lightweight Internet of Vehicles (IoV)-enabled blockchain-based access control protocol with a handover authentication facility (we call it BACHP-IoV, in short). The handover authentication mechanism exploits no computation-costly cryptographic primitives. Once the transactions or messages have been securely gathered by a roadside unit (RSU), $RSU_{j}$, residing in a group of vehicles $Vh_{i}$, will form a partial block, which is later forwarded to a cloud server node in the Peer-to-Peer (P2P) cloud servers blockchain network for converting it into a full block. Next, the full blocks are mined using a voting-based consensus algorithm. In addition, the in-charge trusted authority $\mathcal {TA}$ uploads information about the registered vehicles, such as randomized masked passwords and random secrets, to the blockchain. Thus, an $RSU_{j}$ can check the authenticity of a particular vehicle as well. We prove the security strength of the proposed BACHP-IoV by using the well-known Real-or-Random (ROR)-based random oracle model, the ProVerif 2.03 simulation tool, and informal security analysis. We have implemented the proposed BACHP-IoV through network simulator 3 (NS-3) and blockchain, and the simulation results demonstrate that BACHP-IoV is practical in a real-life scenario. A detailed comparative analysis also shows that BACHP-IoV provides significantly better security and efficiency than the existing competing schemes.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=10285436,IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology,2024
An Efficient Approach With Dynamic Multiswarm of UAVs for Forest Firefighting,"This article proposes the multiswarm cooperative information-driven search and divide and conquer mitigation control (MSCIDC) approach for faster detection and mitigation of forest fires by reducing the loss of biodiversity, nutrients, soil moisture, and other intangible benefits. A swarm is a cooperative group of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) flying together to search and quench the fire areas effectively. The multiswarm cooperative information-driven search uses a two-stage search comprising cooperative information-driven exploration and exploitation for quick/accurate detection of fire locations. The search level is selected based on the thermal sensor information about the potential fire area. The dynamic nature of swarms acquired from global regulative repulsion and merging between swarms reduces the detection and mitigation time compared to the existing methods. The local attraction among the swarm members helps the nondetector members reach the fire location faster, and divide-and-conquer mitigation control ensures a nonoverlapping fire sector allocation for all members quenching the fire. The performance of the MSCIDC has been compared with different multi- UAV methods using a simulated pine forest environment. The Monte-Carlo simulation results indicate that the MSCIDC reduces the average forest area burnt by 65% and mission time by 60% compared to the best case of the multi- UAV approaches, guaranteeing a faster and more successful mission.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85184314950&origin=inward,"IEEE Transactions on Systems, Man, and Cybernetics: Systems",2024
Joint Optimization for Covert Communications in UAV-Assisted NOMA Networks,"In this article, we investigate the design of the trajectory of an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) and the transmit power of ground users to improve covert communications against a flying warden in UAV-assisted non-orthogonal multiple access networks, where the legitimate UAV can simultaneously collect the messages from the multiple ground users in a secure manner. Taking the channel uncertainty into account, we derive the analytical expressions of the optimal normalized detection threshold, the minimum detection error probability (DEP), and the security-guaranteed transmit power constraint for the ground users that are exploited to ensure a high DEP at the warden UAV. Subsequently, the design to maximize the average covert achievable rate (CAR) subject to the constraints of flight speed, initial and final locations, transmit power, and detection performance is formulated as a non-convex optimization problem. To obtain a high-quality solution to the design problem at hand, an iterative block coordinate descent-based successive convex approximation method is proposed. From the theoretical analysis, we find that a greater channel estimation uncertainly or a lower effective received power ratio at the warden UAV is beneficial in enhancing the system covertness towards the warden UAV. Moreover, when the successful detection probability of the warden UAV is sufficiently small, the maximum effective received power ratio is linearly and positively correlated to the detection success probability. Besides, extensive simulations are presented to verify the covert performance advantages brought by the proposed method.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=10230898,IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology,2024
PHY-Layer Authentication Exploiting Channel Sparsity in MmWave MIMO UAV-Ground Systems,"This paper exploits the efficient channel modeling and channel sparsity to propose a novel Physical (PHY)-layer authentication framework for a Millimeter Wave (mmWave) Multiple-Input Multiple-Output (MIMO) Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV)-ground system. Inspired by the Image Processing theory, we first explore a new Laplace prior approach for the efficient modeling of angular-domain mmWave MIMO channels. With the help of the new channel model, we then reveal the channel sparsity in the concerned system exhibiting a nice spatial correlation property. By a joint use of channel sparsity correlation, efficient sparsity feature extraction with Expectation Maximization (EM)/Generalized Approximate Message Passing (GAMP) algorithms and hypothesis testing, we thus devise a new authentication framework for the concerned system. Theoretical performance analysis is also carried out by deriving the closed-form expressions for false alarm and detection probabilities. Finally, extensive numerical results are provided to validate the feasibility of the proposed channel model and the theoretical analysis, as well as to demonstrate the efficiency of the new authentication framework under various scenarios.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=10487976,IEEE Transactions on Information Forensics and Security,2024
Human-Inspired Anticipative Cruise Control for Enhancing Mixed Traffic Flow,"Introducing the human driver’s intelligence of interpreting and anticipating preceding traffic conditions into automated driving control is crucial for improved driving experience. Existing human-like automated driving systems imitate human driver’s reactive control patterns without reflecting anticipative behaviors. These systems involve either online solving predictive optimization or offline training machine learning techniques, which are computationally expensive and impractical for current production vehicles. Additionally, these systems are less effective in traffic environments with lean vehicular connectivity. This paper proposes a practical human-inspired anticipative cruise control for connected automated vehicles (CAVs) that not only respects human drivers’ reactive driving preferences but exploits their anticipative capabilities to enhance mixed traffic flow. Two major contributions are (i) learning the reactive control objective from a segment of the human driving trajectory based on a recovery matrix; and (ii) data-enabled preceding traffic anticipation leveraging the behavioral theory of linear systems, which provides the estimated motion of immediate preceding vehicle (IPV) at a personalized anticipation horizon, considering the downstream traffic trends from a distant connected human-driven vehicle (CHV). The proposed control strategy is evaluated on a human-in-the-loop (HiL) driving simulator. Results validate its real-time implementation potential in (a) learning human-like reactive driving control; (b) improving traffic flow energy economy by 4.58%; (c) enhancing traffic efficiency by attenuating latent traffic fluctuations. Moreover, result reveals that the capability of mitigating traffic fluctuations is affected by the anticipation horizon, which can be adaptably learned from human driver’s timely guidance by virtue of their intelligence of adaptability to dynamic traffic conditions.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=10633242,IEEE Transactions on Intelligent Transportation Systems,2024
ESUAV-NI: Endogenous Security Framework for UAV Perception System Based on Neural Immunity,"Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) represent an essential component of advanced intelligent equipment that can be used as an aerial perception system by installing various sensors such as vision, hearing, touch, taste, and smell to achieve intelligently integrated perception of environments. However, these perception system with environmental information may be threatened by various internal and external attacks, causing a great challenge to the security of the UAV. The original security system relied on an expert knowledge base to prevent attacks, but the weaknesses of lacking proactivity and flexibility are gradually exposed. The strong resistance and survivability of biological systems can be used to fill this capability gap and provide new ideas for the security of the UAV perception system. Therefore, an endogenous security framework (ESUAV-NI) based on the neural system and immune system is proposed in this article. Through breeding artificial intelligence (AI) vaccines and distributed neural hierarchical control, we achieve the security protection for the UAV perception system. Moreover, we evaluated the AI vaccine breeding approach in the ESUAV-NI by conducting extensive experiments on internal threats and external aerial imagery camouflage data, respectively. The results show that the proposed approach has a superior performance for the UAV perception system.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=10111025,IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics,2024

By partitioning the LKF for asymmetric LKF trimming, we ensure a tighter upper bound on the remaining part of the function using appropriate integral inequalities. Additionally, an improved alternating direction algorithm (ADA) is employed to optimize the threshold selection problem while considering initial constraints. Subsequently, we design an intelligent integral-based event-triggering controller (IIETC) that incorporates random trigger signal loss to guarantee AGV stability. We conduct a series of experiments utilizing the CarSim-Simulink AGV joint platform.

Automatic Extraction of Internal Wave From Complex Background Using Polarimetric SAR and Convolutional Neural Network,"As an important ocean dynamic process, internal waves (IWs) have a remarkable effect on sediment resuspension and ocean mixing, and also seriously threaten oil rig operation and the navigability of underwater submarines. Synthetic aperture radar (SAR) is an advanced tool widely applied for IW observation due to its all-weather observation capability. However, complex atmospheric and oceanic environments can obstruct the IW structures in SAR single-channel images, and accurate automated extraction still limits the application of SAR-based IW detection from complex oceanic backgrounds. This study proposes a novel automatic extraction method for IWs to address this problem. The main innovations for accurate IW extraction with SAR data are highlighted as follows. 1) Polarimetric SAR images, which contain more information to characterize IWs, are utilized. 2) An attention-based U-Net is proposed to achieve better feature-focusing capabilities of the IW extraction network. 3) A multiscale loss function is proposed to improve the accuracy of the IW extraction network. We create an IW dataset that contains 1008 scenes of Sentinel-1 images and 10 686 IW crests in the Indo-Pacific warm pool. Experimentally, the proposed method achieves good completeness, correctness, and F1 scores of 94.54%, 81.43%, and 87.50%, respectively, which are significantly higher than other methods. Further experiments indicated that the trained IW extraction network shows satisfactory applicability and accuracy for different test areas and various SAR data. The proposed method has great potential applications for performing ocean/global scale monitoring and statistical analysis of IWs.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=10638688,IEEE Journal of Selected Topics in Applied Earth Observations and Remote Sensing,2024

Chassis Global Dynamics-Oriented Trajectory Planning for Automated Vehicles,"The trajectory planning module generates optimal collision-free paths, which is essential to automated driving. Existing approaches have focused on traffic flow situations and the geometrical feasibility of local trajectories. However, high nonlinearity of vehicle dynamics could cause handling instability or even severe accidents in cases of tracking dynamic infeasible paths. Meanwhile, the variety and complexity of driving environments bring intractable challenges to safe trajectory planning. This article aims to address this crucial issue and proposes a chassis global dynamics-oriented trajectory planning scheme. This work designs comprehensive performance indices to represent handling dynamic status based on chassis dynamics modeling. As the basis of trajectory planning, a reference path is extracted from global digital map data, and the curvilinear coordinate frame is exploited. Numerical optimization is proposed to solve the trajectory planning problem. Thus, an optimal and dynamically feasible trajectory, which satisfies geometrical smoothness, chassis global dynamics indices, and feasible safety, can be generated and transformed. Various scenarios are involved in carrying out simulation tests, and those results demonstrate the excellent capability and effectiveness of the proposed scheme to provide optimal trajectories in a variety of driving situations.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=10289710,"IEEE Transactions on Systems, Man, and Cybernetics: Systems",2024
SegTransConv: Transformer and CNN Hybrid Method for Real-Time Semantic Segmentation of Autonomous Vehicles,"Real-time and high-performance semantic segmentation is a crucial task in the scene understanding of autonomous vehicles. This paper focuses on this issue and proposes a transformer and convolutional neural networks (CNN) hybrid encoder-decoder structure SegTransConv. Firstly, we present a four-stage hierarchical encoder, and the feature extractor in each stage is composed of two transformer layers and CNN modules in series. In this way, the encoder better exploits the global contexts of the input and expands the receptive fields. In the U-shape decoder, the feature maps are upsampled through the proposed feature enhancement upsampling module (FE_Up). Then the knowledge distillation strategy is leveraged to improve the model performance under the guidance of the teacher network STDCNet. Finally, a novel evaluation metric is designed to comprehensively assess the accuracy, speed, floating-point operations (FLOPs), and parameters of real-time segmentation methods. Extensive experiments on two public datasets and self-collected images have evaluated the effectiveness of our method.

CVTNet: A Cross-View Transformer Network for LiDAR-Based Place Recognition in Autonomous Driving Environments,"LiDAR-based place recognition (LPR) is one of the most crucial components of autonomous vehicles to identify previously visited places in GPS-denied environments. Most existing LPR methods use mundane representations of the input point cloud without considering different views, which may not fully exploit the information from LiDAR sensors. In this article, we propose a cross-view transformer-based network, dubbed CVTNet, to fuse the range image views and bird's eye views generated from the LiDAR data. It extracts correlations within the views using intratransformers and between the two different views using intertransformers. Based on that, our proposed CVTNet generates a yaw-angle-invariant global descriptor for each laser scan end-to-end online and retrieves previously seen places by descriptor matching between the current query scan and the prebuilt database. We evaluate our approach on three datasets collected with different sensor setups and environmental conditions. The experimental results show that our method outperforms the state-of-the-art LPR methods with strong robustness to viewpoint changes and long-time spans. Furthermore, our approach has better real-time performance that can run faster than the typical LiDAR frame rate does.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=10273716,IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics,2024
Accuracy-Aware Cooperative Sensing and Computing for Connected Autonomous Vehicles,"To maintain high perception performance among connected and autonomous vehicles (CAVs), in this paper, we propose an accuracy-aware and resource-efficient raw-level cooperative sensing and computing scheme among CAVs and road-side infrastructure. The scheme enables fined-grained partial raw sensing data selection, transmission, fusion, and processing in per-object granularity, by exploiting the parallelism among object classification subtasks associated with each object. A supervised learning model is trained to capture the relationship between the object classification accuracy and the data quality of selected object sensing data, facilitating accuracy-aware sensing data selection. We formulate an optimization problem for joint sensing data selection, subtask placement and resource allocation among multiple object classification subtasks, to minimize the total resource cost while satisfying the delay and accuracy requirements. A genetic algorithm based iterative solution is proposed for the optimization problem.

LCPR: A Multi-Scale Attention-Based LiDAR-Camera Fusion Network for Place Recognition,"Place recognition is one of the most crucial modules for autonomous vehicles to identify places that were previously visited in GPS-invalid environments. Sensor fusion is considered an effective method to overcome the weaknesses of individual sensors. In recent years, multimodal place recognition fusing information from multiple sensors has gathered increasing attention. However, most existing multimodal place recognition methods only use limited field-of-view camera images, which leads to an imbalance between features from different modalities and limits the effectiveness of sensor fusion. In this letter, we present a novel neural network named LCPR for robust multimodal place recognition, which fuses LiDAR point clouds with multi-view RGB images to generate discriminative and yaw-rotation invariant representations of the environment. A multi-scale attention-based fusion module is proposed to fully exploit the panoramic views from different modalities of the environment and their correlations.

Guard-Net: Lightweight Stereo Matching Network via Global and Uncertainty-Aware Refinement for Autonomous Driving,"Stereo matching is a prominent research area in autonomous driving and computer vision. Despite significant progress made by learning-based methods, accurately predicting disparities in hazardous regions, which is crucial for ensuring safe vehicle operation, remains challenging. The limitations of methods based on Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) are most noticeable in textureless regions and repetitive patterns, leading to unreliable predictions. Furthermore, calculating disparities for boundaries and thin structures, where the disparity jump phenomenon is prominent remains difficult. To address these issues, we propose a lightweight stereo matching architecture that focuses on obtaining real-time and high-precision disparity maps in hazardous areas. We exploit an efficient global enhanced path to provide global representations in ill-posed regions, where CNN-based approaches often struggle. Second, our model integrates local and global features to generate more reliable cost volume.

R3O: Robust Radon Radar Odometry,"Being able to measure and track positions of mobile systems is an important capability in many applications, autonomous driving being one major example. With the Robust Radon Radar Odometry algorithm, this article presents an approach for estimating the odometry of vehicles based on radar data only. The algorithm embodies a robust method for estimating the change in orientation as a key feature. The odometry algorithm is under the realm of direct methods, and it exploits properties of the Fourier transform for decoupling the changes in orientation from the changes in translation. In the first step, the Radon transform along with phase-correlation, outlier removal, robust measure of central tendency, keyframe selection and graph optimization are used in order to achieve a robust method for estimating the change in orientation, next the translation is estimated with the support of phase-correlation.

Vision-Based Topological Localization for MAVs,"Vision-based topological localization is recently emerging as a promising alternative to metric pose estimation techniques in robotic navigation systems. Contrarily to the latter, which suffer from a quick degradation of their performance under non-ideal conditions (e.g., scenes with poor illumination and low amount of textures), topological localization trades off precise metric positioning with a more robust and higher-level location representation. State-of-the-art works in this direction, however, often neglect the spatiotemporal relationships between poses that are naturally induced by robotic navigation. Furthermore, these techniques are nearly unexplored for autonomous flying platforms. Inspired by these considerations, in this work, we propose a vision-based topological localization approach designed for Micro Aerial Vehicles (MAVs) applications. Our strategy exploits the framework of graph recurrent neural networks to model the spatial and temporal dependencies and estimate the location of the robot with respect to a topological graph representing the environment. We demonstrate with experiments on different sets of scenarios, including scenes that considerably differ from those used in the training phase, that our approach is able to outperform state-of-the-art place recognition baselines.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85179825563&origin=inward,IEEE Robotics and Automation Letters,2024
Leveraging Single-Bounce Reflections and Onboard Motion Sensors for Enhanced 5G Positioning,"5G-based mmWave wireless positioning has emerged as a promising solution for autonomous vehicle (AV) positioning in recent years. Previous studies have highlighted the benefits of fusing line-of-sight (LoS) 5G signals with an Inertial Navigation System (INS) for an improved positioning solution. However, the highly dynamic environment of urban areas, where AVs are expected to operate, poses a challenge, as non-line-of-sight (NLoS) communication can deteriorate the 5G mmWave positioning solution and lead to erroneous corrections to the INS. To address this challenge, we exploit 5G single-bounce reflections (SBRs) and LoS signals to improve positioning performance in dense urban environments. In addition, we integrate the proposed 5G-based positioning with a low-cost inertial measurement unit (IMU) and a wheel encoder. Moreover, the integration is realized using an unscented Kalman filter (UKF) as an alternative to the widely utilized extended Kalman filter (EKF) within the 5G-based positioning research community. We performed two test trajectories in the dense urban environment of downtown Toronto, Canada. For each trajectory, quasi-real 5G measurements were generated using a ray-tracing tool incorporating 3D map scans of real-world buildings, allowing for realistic NLoS and multipath scenarios. For the same trajectories, real motion data were collected from two different low-cost IMUs. Our integrated positioning solution was capable of maintaining a level of accuracy below 30 cm for approximately 97% of the time, which is superior to the accuracy level achieved when SBR signals are not considered, which is only around 92% of the time.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85207888526&origin=inward,IEEE Transactions on Intelligent Transportation Systems,2024
Cooperative Localization for Asynchronous AUVs Using Time Difference of Communication in Underwater Anchor-Free Environments,"The asynchronization among autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs) is inevitable due to the inherent offsets and drifts in clocks, which critically degrades the accuracy of AUV cooperative localization (CL), especially in underwater anchor-free environments. This article designs a novel relative measurement representation called time difference of communication (TDOC) to eliminate the impact of asynchronization, which only requires one-way inter-AUV communications at different time steps even in the presence of large asynchronization. By exploiting TDOC, a joint spatial-temporal CL model is established with specially constructed measurement vectors, and a CL method, termed TDOC-CL, is proposed. It transforms the nonlinear observations into a weighted least-square (WLS) formation and is solved via iterative optimization, where various coupled uncertainties (i.e., measurement biases, measurement noises, and position errors) are involved and analyzed. Moreover, to compensate the accuracy degradation caused by the uncertainties, the TDOC-CL with bias reduction and error compensation, named iTDOC-CL-BREC, is further designed. In addition, the hybrid Cramér-Rao lower bound (HCRLB) is derived as the performance benchmark to evaluate the localization behaviors. Simulations and field experiments show that iTDOC-CL-BREC can provide higher localization accuracy compared with state-of-the-art methods, especially for long-duration tasks.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85208204591&origin=inward,IEEE Transactions on Cybernetics,2024
SwissCheese: Fine-Grained Channel-Spatial Feature Filtering for Communication-Efficient Cooperative Perception,"Cooperative perception is an effective way for connected autonomous vehicles (CAVs) to surpass their sensing limitations, by sharing information like intermediate features extracted from images or point clouds with each other. To reduce bandwidth consumption, feature filtering is adopted by existing methods to share only the most valuable information. However, these methods assume that the features on the same channel across all spatial regions or those in the same spatial regions across all the channels are equally important. This assumption results in coarse-grained feature filtering, which greatly decreases the cooperative perception performance. To solve this problem, this paper proposes a fine-grained channel-spatial feature filtering scheme, named SwissCheese, for communication-efficient cooperative perception. The key idea of SwissCheese is to exploit the disparity in semantic information on features between different spatial regions on different channels. Specifically, a fine-grained collaborative attention module is developed to jointly learn fine-grained attention along the channel-spatial dimensions. Moreover, a dual-dimensional feature selection strategy that selects sparse features for transmission based on the current available bandwidth is designed to achieve optimal perception performance. Experiment results show that SwissCheese significantly reduces the transmission data size by 90% with a subtle loss in perception performance.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=10732008,IEEE Transactions on Intelligent Transportation Systems,2024
Efficient Vehicular Collaborative Perception Based on Saptial-Temporal Feature Compression,"In collaborative perception, autonomous vehicles with limited perception capabilities can communicate with each other to achieve a more holographic and effective perception result. Real-world communication systems, however, are usually constrained by wireless communication resources or reliability and cannot handle the enormous real-time data transmissions to support the delay-sensitive collaborative perception. To resolve this issue, we propose an efficient vehicular Collaborative Perception method based on Spatial-temporal feature Compression (CPSC) that exploits the trade-off between perception performance and bandwidth consumption. It performs feature-level compression by focusing on critical regions of perceptual information in the spatial-temporal domain and adapts traffic according to network conditions. To the best of our knowledge, this paper presents the first work where temporal feature redundancy is considered for enhancing the efficiency of collaborative perception. To thoroughly evaluate CPSC, we conduct extensive experiments of collaborative 3D object detection tasks on the real-world dataset DAIR-V2X and the simulated dataset OPV2V. The results show that CPSC outperforms the SOTA collaborative perception methods by 2.91% for AP@0.7 in OPV2V dataset and 1.71% for AP@0.5 in DAIR-V2X dataset. Meanwhile, CPSC attains a communication volume reduction of more than 10 times while consistently outperforming the previous SOTA method.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=10549854,IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology,2024
Diver Identification Using Anthropometric Data Ratios for Underwater Multi-Human–Robot Collaboration,"Recent advances in efficient design, perception algorithms, and computing hardware have made it possible to create improved human–robot interaction (HRI) capabilities for autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs). To conduct secure missions as underwater human–robot teams, AUVs require the ability to accurately identify divers. However, this remains an open problem due to divers' challenging visual features, mainly caused by similar-looking scuba gear. In this letter, we present a novel algorithm that can perform diver identification using either pre-trained models or models trained during deployment. We exploit anthropometric data obtained from diver pose estimates to generate robust features that are invariant to changes in distance and photometric conditions. We also propose an embedding network that maximizes inter-class distances in the feature space and minimizes those for the intra-class features, which significantly improves classification performance. Furthermore, we present an end-to-end diver identification framework that operates on an AUV and evaluate the accuracy of the proposed algorithm. Quantitative results in controlled-water experiments show that our algorithm achieves a high level of accuracy in diver identification.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=10436345,IEEE Robotics and Automation Letters,2024
BEV-TP: End-to-End Visual Perception and Trajectory Prediction for Autonomous Driving,"For autonomous vehicles (AVs), the ability for effective end-to-end perception and future trajectory prediction is critical in planning a safe automatic maneuver. In the current AVs systems, perception and prediction are two separate modules. The prediction module receives only a restricted amount of information from the perception module. Furthermore, perception errors will propagate into the prediction module, ultimately having a negative impact on the accuracy of the prediction results. In this paper, we present a novel framework termed BEV-TP, a visual context-guided center-based transformer network for joint 3D perception and trajectory prediction. BEV-TP exploits visual information from consecutive multi-view images and context information from HD semantic maps, to predict better objects’ centers whose locations are then used to query visual features and context features via the attention mechanism. Generated agent queries and map queries facilitate learning of the transformer module for further feature aggregation. Finally, multiple regression heads are used to perform 3D bounding box detection and future velocity prediction. This center-based approach achieves a differentiable, simple, and efficient E2E trajectory prediction framework. Extensive experiments conducted on the nuScenes dataset demonstrate the effectiveness of BEV-TP over traditional pipelines with sequential paradigms.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=10623523,IEEE Transactions on Intelligent Transportation Systems,2024
Illumination Distribution-Aware Thermal Pedestrian Detection,"Pedestrian detection is an important task in computer vision, which is also an important part of intelligent transportation systems. For privacy protection, thermal images are widely used in pedestrian detection problems. However, thermal pedestrian detection is challenging due to the significant effect of temperature variation on the illumination of images and that fine-grained illumination annotations are difficult to be acquired. The existing methods have attempted to exploit coarse-grained day/night labels, which however even hampers the model performance. In this work, we introduce a novel idea of regressing conditional thermal-visible feature distribution, dubbed as Illumination Distribution-Aware adaptation (IDA). The key idea is to predict the conditional visible feature distribution given a thermal image, subject to their pre-computed joint distribution. Specifically, we first estimate the thermal-visible feature joint distribution by constructing feature co-occurrence matrices, offering a conditional probability distribution for any given thermal image. With this pairing information, we then form a conditional probability distribution regression task for model optimization. Critically, as a model agnostic strategy, this allows the visible feature knowledge to be transferred to the thermal counterpart implicitly for learning more discriminating feature representation. Experiment results show that our method outperforms the prior art methods, which use extra illumination annotations. Besides, as a plug-in, our method can averagely reduce about 2% MR on KAIST dataset, and improve about 1% mAP on FLIR-aligned and Autonomous Vehicles datasets without extra calculation for test. Code is available at https://github.com/HaMeow-lst1/IDA.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85209390348&origin=inward,IEEE Transactions on Intelligent Transportation Systems,2024
Goal-Guided and Interaction-Aware State Refinement Graph Attention Network for Multi-Agent Trajectory Prediction,"Multi-agent trajectory prediction plays a pivotal role for intelligent transportation and autonomous driving. Modeling the social interaction among agents and revealing the inherent relationship between interaction and future trajectory are crucial for accurate trajectory prediction. To address these challenges, this letter proposes a goal-guided and interaction-aware state refinement graph attention network (SRGAT) for multi-agent trajectory prediction. Specifically, the trajectory sequence of individual agent is firstly converted into a compact representation by exploiting Transformer encoder and gated recurrent unit (GRU). Then, a social state refinement (SSR) module for modeling social influence between agents is proposed to include more interaction-related features. Subsequently, multiple goals are predicted for each agent, followed by another goal-guided SSR module to incorporate goal information into social interaction. Finally, the multimodal trajectory is forecasted by fusing the features from forward and backward GRU. Experiments on public benchmark datasets are carried out to evaluate the effectiveness of our model. The results demonstrate the superior performance of our model compared with the state-of-the-art methods.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=10313963,IEEE Robotics and Automation Letters,2024
Context-Aware Meta-RL With Two-Stage Constrained Adaptation for Urban Driving,"End-to-end driving based on reinforcement learning (RL) has emerged as a promising approach in autonomous driving, with the potential to surpass human drivers. However, the exploration and exploitation dilemma of RL leads to low sample efficiency and high computational costs to train an optimal driving model, and the environment feedback-oriented learning mode limits the model's ability to handle unseen traffic scenarios, especially when dealing with the highly varied tasks of urban driving. In this article, we proposed a context-aware meta-RL framework with two-stage constrained adaptation for challenging urban driving. Firstly, the context-aware state representation enhanced by historical behavior is construct to improve the learning efficiency and robustness, where the most efficient context encoder is selected among four different forms. Next, the end-to-end meta-driving model with high generalization ability is built through the parallel rollouts of multiple tasks and simplified meta-training procedure. Then, a two-stage constrained adaptation strategy is designed to quickly transfer the meta model to new tasks while maintaining good performance, where the meta-training data are reused through the context-based propensity estimation to constrain the optimization objective of new tasks. Extensive experiments are performed in CARLA simulator with various urban scenarios, and the results validate the superiority of our proposed models in both learning efficiencyand generalization compared to state-of-the-art algorithms.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=10242012,IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology,2024
Threat Assessment Strategy of Human-in-the-Loop Unmanned Underwater Vehicle Under Uncertain Events,"Gls UUV is an intelligent underwater platform that can operate autonomously. However, it is difficult for unmanned underwater vehicle (UUV) to make correct decisions timely and independently in the face of uncertain events. Therefore, it is necessary to assess the threat of uncertain events and guide UUV to make timely and accurate decisions. This article studies the threat assessment strategy of a human-in-the-loop UUV under uncertain events. First, the uncertain events are classified according to their characteristics, and the Bayesian network (BN) is constructed by taking the characteristic variables of uncertain events as neurons. Then, the human experiences are combined with the genetic optimization algorithm to determine the BN parameters. According to the reasoning of the BN, the threat of uncertain events is evaluated. Finally, according to the threat assessment results, the PSO and A/B model are used to replan the task. The proposed algorithm uses BN to represent uncertain events and introduces human experiences to optimize network parameters, eliminating subjective bias and improving the accuracy of threat assessment. At the same time, the task replanning strategy is introduced to ensure the security of UUV. Four typical UUV tasks are designed, and the trigger elements of uncertain events are set in the simulation to verify the performance of the proposed algorithm. The simulation and experiment results show that a UUV can accurately assess the threat level of uncertain events during the task execution process when using the proposed strategy. The safety of the human-in-the-loop UUV operation is guaranteed by task replanning.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=10255075,"IEEE Transactions on Systems, Man, and Cybernetics: Systems",2024
Smart Mobility Digital Twin Based Automated Vehicle Navigation System: A Proof of Concept,"Digital twins (DTs) have driven major advancements across various industrial domains over the past two decades. With the rapid advancements in autonomous driving and vehicle-to-everything (V2X) technologies, integrating DTs into vehicular platforms is anticipated to further revolutionize smart mobility systems. In this paper, a new smart mobility DT (SMDT) platform is proposed for the control of connected and automated vehicles (CAVs) over next-generation wireless networks. In particular, the proposed platform enables cloud services to leverage the abilities of DTs to promote the autonomous driving experience. To enhance traffic efficiency and road safety measures, a novel navigation system that exploits available DT information is designed. The SMDT platform and navigation system are implemented with state-of-the-art products, e.g., CAVs and roadside units (RSUs), and emerging technologies, e.g., cloud and cellular V2X (C-V2X). In addition, proof-of-concept (PoC) experiments are conducted to validate system performance. The performance of SMDT is evaluated from two standpoints: (i) the rewards of the proposed navigation system on traffic efficiency and safety and, (ii) the latency and reliability of the SMDT platform. Our experimental results using SUMO-based large-scale traffic simulations show that the proposed SMDT can reduce the average travel time and the blocking probability due to unexpected traffic incidents. Furthermore, the results record a peak overall latency for DT modeling and route planning services to be 155.15 ms and 810.59 ms, respectively, which validates that our proposed design aligns with the 3GPP requirements for emerging V2X use cases and fulfills the targets of the proposed design.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85186075938&origin=inward,IEEE Transactions on Intelligent Vehicles,2024
"Next Generation Vehicles, Safety, and Cybersecurity—The CMX Framework","Safety, privacy, efficiency and cybersecurity (SPEC) properties are mandatory in vehicular networks.

We explore the CMX framework (Coordinated Mobility for X = SPEC), Next Generation Vehicles (NGVs), and protocols for safety-critical inter-vehicle communications and agreements that solve problems left open in the V2X framework. Then, we focus on cyberattacks and physical attacks against isolated NGVs and cohorts of NGVs.

P-MapNet: Far-Seeing Map Generator Enhanced by Both SDMap and HDMap Priors,"Autonomous vehicles are gradually entering city roads today, with the help of high-definition maps (HDMaps). However, the reliance on HDMaps prevents autonomous vehicles from stepping into regions without this expensive digital infrastructure. This fact drives many researchers to study online HDMap generation algorithms, but the performance of these algorithms at far regions is still unsatisfying. We present P-MapNet, in which the letter P highlights the fact that we focus on incorporating map priors to improve model performance. Specifically, we exploit priors in both standard-definition map (SDMap) and HDMap. On one hand, we extract weakly aligned SDMap from OpenStreetMap and encode it as an additional conditioning branch. Despite the misalignment challenge, our attention-based architecture adaptively attends to relevant SDMap skeletons and significantly improves performance. On the other hand, we exploit a masked autoencoder to capture the prior distribution of HDMap, which can serve as a refinement module to mitigate occlusions and artifacts. We benchmark on the nuScenes and Argoverse2 datasets.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=10643284,IEEE Robotics and Automation Letters,2024
Blockchain-Assisted Lightweight Authenticated Key Agreement Security Framework for Smart Vehicles-Enabled Intelligent Transportation System,"Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS) supported by smart vehicles have revolutionized modern transportation, offering a wide range of applications and services, such as electronic toll collection, collision avoidance alarms, real-time parking management, and traffic planning. However, the open communication channels among various entities, including smart vehicles, roadside infrastructure, and fleet management systems, introduce security and privacy vulnerabilities. To address these concerns, we propose a novel security framework, named blockchain-assisted lightweight authenticated key agreement security framework for smart vehicles-enabled ITS (BASF-ITS), which ensures data protection both during transit and while stored on cloud servers. BASF-ITS employs a combination of efficient cryptographic primitives, including hash functions, XOR operator, ASCON, elliptic curve cryptography, and physical unclonable functions (PUF), to design authenticated key agreement schemes. The inclusion of PUF significantly enhances the system’s resistance to physical attacks, preventing tampering attempts. To ensure data integrity when stored on the cloud, our framework incorporates blockchain technology. By leveraging the immutability and decentralization of the blockchain, BASF-ITS effectively safeguards data at rest, providing an additional layer of security. We rigorously analyze the security of BASF-ITS and demonstrate its strong resistance against potential security ass aults, making it a robust and reliable solution for smart vehicle-enabled ITS. In a comparative analysis with contemporary competing schemes, BASF-ITS emerges as a promising approach, offering superior functionality traits, enhanced security features, and reduced computation, communication, and storage costs. Furthermore, we present a practical implementation of BASF-ITS using blockchain technology, showcasing the computational time versus the “transactions per block” and the “number of mined blocks”, confirming its efficiency and viability in real-world scenarios. Note to Practitioners—This article is motivated by designing an efficient, lightweight, and anonymous blockchain-enabled authenticated security framework that can fix the security and privacy concerns in insecure environments for ITS applications, such as automated road speed enforcement, collision avoidance alarm systems, and traffic planning and management, etc. Authenticated key agreement schemes are extensively used to secure communications in the ITS environment. However, the existing state-of-the-art schemes are not efficient in terms of performance, are not resilient against potential security attacks, and do not support anonymity, untraceability, and unlinkability. Therefore, we propose the authenticated security framework to secure communication among the participating entities in the ITS environment. It utilizes efficient cryptographic primitives, such as hash function, XOR-operator, ASCON, elliptic curve cryptography, and PUF. It is shown that the proposed framework can be deployed as a robust tool to address the ITS security problems efficiently. Moreover, the proposed framework is lightweight and efficient and can be easily deployed in various ITS applications and other resource-constrained environments. However, the participating entities, such as vehicles and roadside units, must be PUF-enabled to deploy the proposed framework.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=10487806,IEEE Transactions on Automation Science and Engineering,2024
Event-Triggered Adaptive Bipartite Secure Consensus Asymptotic Tracking Control for Nonlinear MASs Subject to DoS Attacks,"This paper proposes an adaptive bipartite secure consensus asymptotic tracking control scheme based on event-triggered strategy for the nonlinear multi-agent systems (MASs) under denial-of-service (DoS) attacks. First, by incorporating the concept of shortest path into the hierarchical algorithm, the bipartite consensus control problem in the presence of unbalanced communication topology is successfully addressed. Further, an anti-attack bipartite control strategy by designing the improved forms of the tracking errors and virtual controllers is proposed under DoS attacks. Then, a modified event-triggered mechanism based on the relative threshold strategy is proposed, which can ensure that the bipartite consensus tracking errors converge to zero asymptotically by utilizing the Barbalat’s Lemma. Under the Lyapunov stability theory, it is guaranteed that the outputs of all agents can reach agreement with an identical magnitude but opposite signs and all the signals of the closed-loop MASs are bounded. Finally, the simulation results on the model of damping pendulums are given to verify the efficiency of the proposed secure controller. Note to Practitioners—In this paper, the adaptive bipartite secure consensus asymptotic tracking control problem is considered for nonlinear MASs subject to DoS attacks, whose models can describe many critical applications, such as bidirectional formation of unmanned vehicles and robots. The research on the secure tracking control problem will be rather complicated yet challenging if the DoS attacks of the communication channels are taken into account in the insecure complex network environment. In addition, the event-triggered mechanism is used to reduce the usage of communication resources, which makes the proposed control scheme more easier to implement and more friendly for control engineers.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=10155624,IEEE Transactions on Automation Science and Engineering,2024
Leveraging Digital Twin and DRL for Collaborative Context Offloading in C-V2X Autonomous Driving,"Digital Twin (DT) technology, as a promising technology, can achieve the vehicular contexts mapping of the virtual world and physical world in a collaborative autonomous driving (CAD) system. DT technology is developed on the basis of C-V2X, 6G, Mobile Edge Computing (MEC), Machine Learning (ML) and other technologies, which can enable the creation of robust and reliable digital twin-based collaborative autonomous driving architectures, providing a platform for testing, validating, and refining autonomous driving systems in a highly efficient and safe manner. However, the future large-scale CAD system needs greater real-time processing and resource collaboration capability for autonomous vehicles (AVs). Especially considering the mobility of AVs, it puts higher demands on the management of AVs. In this article, we present a digital twin (DT)-based collaborative autonomous driving (DTCAD) three-layer architecture in C-V2X to provide better resource management of AVs. In order to improve the Quality of Service (QoS) and reduce the processing latency in large-scale CAD scenarios, a scalable Deep Reinforcement Learning and Mean Field Game method (DDPG-MFG) are proposed, where the dynamic and real-time interaction between AVs is approximated as a mean-field gaming process in DT resource allocation. Especially, to improve the interaction efficiency between AVs and CAD environment, we design more efficient exploitation and exploration algorithms for AVs. The CARLA simulation demonstrates our proposed algorithm significantly reduces the task offloading latency, and improves the average rewards by 28.5%, 3.5%, and 6.8%, compared with traditional DDPG, TD3, and AC, respectively.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85177025404&origin=inward,IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology,2024
Formation Control for an UAV Team With Environment-Aware Dynamic Constraints,"State-of-the-art literature on constrained multiagent system operations can only deal with constant or at best time-varying constraint requirements. Such constraint formulations cannot respond well to the dynamic environment and presence of external agents outside of the multiagent system. In this work, we consider a formation tracking problem for a group of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) in the presence of a physical attacker. The safety/performance constraint functions are environment-aware and dynamic in nature, whose formulation depends on certain path parameters and presence of the attacker. The dependence on path ensures adaptation to the dynamic operation environment. The dependence on the attacker ensures swift adjustment based on the relative distances between the attacker and agents. UAV desired paths and desired path speeds can also be both path- and attacker-dependent. Composite barrier functions have been proposed to address the constraint requirements. Neural network is used to approximate unknown attacker velocity, where the ideal weight matrix is learned by adaptive laws. Besides, unknown system parameters and external disturbances are estimated by adaptive laws. The proposed formation architecture can ensure formation tracking errors converge exponentially to small neighborhoods near the equilibrium, with all constraint requirements met. At the end a simulation study further illustrates the proposed scheme and demonstrates its efficacy.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=10183872,IEEE Transactions on Intelligent Vehicles,2024
Collaborative Honeypot Defense in UAV Networks: A Learning-Based Game Approach,"The proliferation of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) opens up new opportunities for on-demand service provision anywhere and anytime, but also exposes UAVs to a variety of cyber threats. Low/medium interaction honeypots offer a promising lightweight defense for actively protecting mobile Internet of things, particularly UAV networks. While previous research has primarily focused on honeypot system design and attack pattern recognition, the incentive issue for motivating UAVs’ participation (e.g., sharing trapped attack data in honeypots) to collaboratively resist distributed and sophisticated attacks remains unexplored. This paper proposes a novel game-theoretical collaborative defense approach to address optimal, fair, and feasible incentive design, in the presence of network dynamics and UAVs’ multi-dimensional private information (e.g., valid defense data (VDD) volume, communication delay, and UAV cost). Specifically, we first develop a honeypot game between UAVs and the network operator under both partial and complete information asymmetry scenarios. The optimal VDD-reward contract design problem with partial information asymmetry is then solved using a contract-theoretic approach that ensures budget feasibility, truthfulness, fairness, and computational efficiency. In addition, under complete information asymmetry, we devise a distributed reinforcement learning algorithm to dynamically design optimal contracts for distinct types of UAVs in the time-varying UAV network. Extensive simulations demonstrate that the proposed scheme can motivate UAV’s cooperation in VDD sharing and improve defensive effectiveness, compared with conventional schemes.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=10273619,IEEE Transactions on Information Forensics and Security,2024
RLBA-UAV: A Robust and Lightweight Blockchain-Based Authentication and Key Agreement Scheme for PUF-Enabled UAVs,"Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) integrated with the internet of things (IoT) guarantee useful advantages such as facilitating ground communications in regions where the availability of connectivity is restricted owing to physical obstacles. However, the data transmitted by sensors and IoT embedded in UAVs are facing new security issues and privacy challenges with the known security attacks over time. To address these security attacks and threats and meet lightweight UAV communication requirements, a secure and lightweight authentication and key agreement (AKA) scheme is essential. Recently, researchers have designed a lightweight blockchain-enabled AKA scheme with privacy-preserving for UAVs to provide useful and reliable services. However, we prove that the existing scheme is fragile to various security attacks and does not ensure mutual authentication. Thus, we propose a robust and lightweight blockchain-based AKA scheme for PUF-enabled UAVs, called RLBA-UAV to enhance the security problems of the existing scheme. We demonstrate the security of RLBA-UAV by using informal/formal security analyses such as the ROR oracle model and AVISPA simulation. Moreover, we demonstrate the performance comparison analysis between RLBA-UAV and related schemes for UAVs. We demonstrate an implementation of a network simulator (NS) 3 compliant with IEEE 802.11p standards to show its validation and feasibility that RLBA-UAV is appropriate for practical UAVs. Thus, RLBA-UAV offers enhanced security and operational efficiency compared to related schemes and can be applied to practical blockchain-based AKA systems for UAVs.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=10734851,IEEE Transactions on Intelligent Transportation Systems,2024
A Tri-Phases Message Oriented Trust Model in FANET,"With advantages of convenience and flexibility, Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) are widely applied in various fields, such as inspection, agriculture, transportation, and so on. However, due to characteristics of Flying Ad Hoc Network (FANET) consisting of UAVs, such as dynamic topology and limited bandwidth, the security of messages is threatened by cyber attacks. A Tri-Phases Message Oriented Trust Model for FANET is proposed, called TPMOTM, to secure messages. In the proposed work, the message collection process is divided into three phases, including message generation, message transmission, and message integration. In each phase, by analyzing potential attacks and the circumstance of network, the TPMOTM quantifies the specific detection factors to obtain the trust value of messages, including timeliness, detection accuracy, message error rate, relay performance, authentication result, and message loss rate. After messages have been received by the Ground Station (GS), the GS integrates all messages in relation to the detected event, employing the message trust value as the weight, to obtain the state of detected event. Extensive simulations are conducted based on the Opportunistic Network Environment (ONE) simulator, with attack message detection rates reaching up to 95% ($\pm 0.89\%$) and event detection accuracy rates typically above 85% ($\pm 1.21\%$).",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=10463167,IEEE Transactions on Network Science and Engineering,2024
Joint Trajectory and Primary-Secondary Transmission Design for UAV-Carried-IRS Assisted Underlay CR Networks,"A novel unmanned aerial vehicle-carried-intelligent reflecting surface (UAV-carried-IRS)-assisted underlay cognitive radio network (UAV-IRS-UCRN) is investigated, where dynamic UAV-carried-IRS inherits the advantages of IRS and adds a new motion dimension to flexibly assist the primary user (PU)-secondary user (SU) transmission, and both the PU and the SU enjoy seamless connectivity at all the times. A SU's average rate-maximized optimization problem is constructed under fully satisfying the service quality of PU. Since the strong coupling of the optimization variables makes solving this problem very tricky, the original problem is divided into the SU's transmitted power sub-problem, the phase shift matrix and the trajectory of UAV-carried-IRS sub-problems. Then, the sub-problems are solved by deriving the closed-form solution and exploiting semi-definite relaxation, charnes-cooper transformation and successive convex approximation techniques.

Vehicular Ad Hoc Networks Topology Optimization for Autonomous Intersection Management System: A Periodic Intervention-Based Approach,"It is important to achieve the real-time and reliable vehicular ad hoc networks (VANETs) for the safety and efficiency of the autonomous intersection management (AIM) system. However, there are challenges in establishing the low-delay and robustness VANETs topology in a horizon due to the high mobility, intersection shelters and malicious attacks. This paper investigates the long-horizon VANETs networking problem with the objective of producing the robust topology in the process of routing paths planning. To achieve this goal, a centralized periodic intervention networking (CPIN) approach is proposed, which consists of three main modules: long-horizon information mapping, full-path routing modeling and proactive optimization mechanism. The first module aims to provide a spatio-temporal delay tensor, considering the mobility and the quality of service (QoS). The second module converts routing path planning into a combinatorial optimization problem to achieve long-horizon full-path routing. The third module introduces a proactive optimization mechanism based on node degree centrality to evolve the VANETs networking process toward high robustness. To find the optimal solution efficiently, we propose an improved Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) algorithm based on the operational characteristics of the AIM system. A series of simulation experiments are carried out to verify the effectiveness of CPIN. The results show that the CPIN outperforms the benchmark method in terms of time delay, wireless hops, and network robustness. Specifically, the CPIN reduces the average time delay by at most 44.4%-48.3% while ensuring relative high robustness.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=10568449,IEEE Transactions on Intelligent Transportation Systems,2024
Learning-Based Autonomous Channel Access in the Presence of Hidden Terminals,"We consider the problem of autonomous channel access (AutoCA), where a group of terminals tries to discover a communication strategy with an access point (AP) via a common wireless channel in a distributed fashion. Due to the irregular topology and the limited communication range of terminals, a practical challenge for AutoCA is the hidden terminal problem, which is notorious in wireless networks for deteriorating throughput and delay performances. To meet the challenge, this paper presents a new multi-agent deep reinforcement learning paradigm, dubbed MADRL-HT, tailored for AutoCA in the presence of hidden terminals. MADRL-HT exploits topological insights and transforms the observation space of each terminal into a scalable form independent of the number of terminals. To compensate for the partial observability, we put forth a look-back mechanism such that the terminals can infer behaviors of their hidden terminals from the carrier-sensed channel states as well as feedback from the AP. A window-based global reward function is proposed, whereby the terminals are instructed to maximize the system throughput while balancing the terminals’ transmission opportunities over the course of learning. Considering short-packet machine-type communications, extensive numerical experiments verified the superior performance of our solution benchmarked against the legacy carrier-sense multiple access with collision avoidance (CSMA/CA) protocol.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=10143731,IEEE Transactions on Mobile Computing,2024

Worst Perception Scenario Search via Recurrent Neural Controller and K-Reciprocal Re-Ranking,"Achieving excellent generalization on perceiving real traffic scenarios with diversity is the long-term goal for building robust autonomous driving systems. A recent theoretical study shows that the generalization on the worst-group of test samples is far more difficult than others. Therefore, we propose to discover potential shortness of certain perception module by analyzing its worst-scenario performance. However, with the benchmark datasets growing huge and tremendous, exhaustive searching for the worst perception scenario (WPS) seems to be time consuming and unnecessary. To address this, we present an automatic searching scheme empowered by reinforcement learning. In this case, worst scenario mining is formulated as the discrete search on the Visual Operation Design Domain (ODD), namely scenario representation, by optimizing LSTM-RNN controller with the worst-performance reward. Moreover, a time-efficient K-reciprocal re-ranking technique is utilized to match the predicted scenario parameters with existing test data. The proposed method has been validated by finding the most challenging scenarios for various vehicle detectors on KITTI, BDD100k and our own benchmark set EVB. Furthermore, searching performances w.r.t different Visual ODDs are investigated and it is found that visual representations through generative adversarial network contribute to a better performance.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85181565951&origin=inward,IEEE Transactions on Intelligent Transportation Systems,2024
TrajPRed: Trajectory Prediction With Region-Based Relation Learning,"Forecasting human trajectories in traffic scenes is critical for safety within mixed or fully autonomous systems. Human future trajectories are driven by two major stimuli, social interactions, and stochastic goals. Thus, reliable forecasting needs to capture these two stimuli. Edge-based relation modeling represents social interactions using pairwise correlations from precise individual states. Nevertheless, edge-based relations can be vulnerable under perturbations. To alleviate these issues, we propose a region-based relation learning paradigm that models social interactions via region-wise dynamics of joint states, i.e., the changes in the density of crowds. In particular, region-wise agent joint information is encoded within convolutional feature grids. Social relations are modeled by relating the temporal changes of local joint information from a global perspective. We show that region-based relations are less susceptible to perturbations. In order to account for the stochastic individual goals, we exploit a conditional variational autoencoder to realize multi-goal estimation and diverse future prediction. Specifically, we perform variational inference via the latent distribution, which is conditioned on the correlation between input states and associated target goals. Sampling from the latent distribution enables the framework to reliably capture the stochastic behavior in test data. We integrate multi-goal estimation and region-based relation learning to model the two stimuli, social interactions, and stochastic goals, in a prediction framework. We evaluate our framework on the ETH-UCY dataset and Stanford Drone Dataset (SDD). We show that diverse prediction benefits from region-based relation learning. The predicted intermediate location distributions better fit the ground truth when incorporating the relation module. Our framework outperforms the state-of-the-art models on SDD by 27.61%/18.20% of ADE/FDE metrics.

Covert Communication in Large-Scale Multi-Tier LEO Satellite Networks,"We leverage covert communication to enhance the security of a large-scale multi-tier Low Earth Orbit (LEO) satellite network against vigilant adversarial terrestrial Base Stations (BSs) aiming at detecting satellite transmissions. This approach involves deploying massive LEO satellites at different altitudes around Earth to form a multi-tier network serving as a backhaul for near-ground Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) that provide network services to terrestrial mobile users. Meanwhile, terrestrial BSs attempt to detect satellite transmissions based on their own received signal powers. To evade detection, the LEO satellite network performs power control to obscure the satellite transmission within the co-channel interference among the LEO satellites. We formulate a two-stage Stackelberg game to model the conflict dynamics between the terrestrial BSs and the LEO satellite network. In this game, the terrestrial BSs act as non-cooperative followers at the lower stage aiming to minimize their detection errors. On the other hand, the LEO satellite network acts as the leader at the upper stage aiming to maximize its utility while ensuring communication covertness. In contrast to existing works that focus on a small set of network nodes, our study considers a large-scale multi-tier LEO satellite network and employs stochastic geometry to model the spatial distribution of network nodes. To achieve the Stackelberg equilibrium, we develop a bi-level algorithm based on Successive Convex Approximation (SCA) and golden-section search. Our numerical results provide practical insights, revealing a trade-off in leveraging co-channel interference (i.e., while it improves the communication covertness of satellite transmission, it simultaneously degrades the link reliability).",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=10520820,IEEE Transactions on Mobile Computing,2024
Multiple Unmanned Aerial Vehicles Coalition Formation and Control for Collaborative Defense Mission,"This article investigates the collaborative defense problem of multiple unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) in a 3-D space with an important area. A two-phase defense strategy is proposed for multiple defending UAVs (defenders) to cooperatively prevent the adversarial UAVs (intruders) from approaching the important area. In the first phase, considering that a single defender may lack the ability to neutralize an intruder independently, a game-theoretical-based coalition formation algorithm is proposed to drive defenders to form different-sized defending coalitions to neutralize multiple intruders with different abilities. In the second phase, once a defending coalition is established, a distributed enclosing control protocol is presented to guide the coalition members to collaboratively form an enclosing configuration around the detected intruder, the purpose of which is to restrict the movement of the intruder. Both the coalition formation algorithm and the enclosing control protocol are designed based on the local interactions with the neighboring defenders, which are scalable and executable. Simulation tests demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed strategy. Meanwhile, the scalability and flexibility of the proposed strategy are also discussed in detail.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=10534867,IEEE Transactions on Aerospace and Electronic Systems,2024
Multi-Objective Optimization for UAV Swarm-Assisted IoT With Virtual Antenna Arrays,"Unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) network is a promising technology for assisting Internet-of-Things (IoT), where a UAV can use its limited service coverage to harvest and disseminate data from IoT devices with low transmission abilities. The existing UAV-assisted data harvesting and dissemination schemes largely require UAVs to frequently fly between the IoTs and access points, resulting in extra energy and time costs. To reduce both energy and time costs, a key way is to enhance the transmission performance of IoT and UAVs. In this work, we introduce collaborative beamforming into IoTs and UAVs simultaneously to achieve energy and time-efficient data harvesting and dissemination from multiple IoT clusters to remote base stations (BSs). Except for reducing these costs, another non-ignorable threat lies in the existence of the potential eavesdroppers, whereas the handling of eavesdroppers often increases the energy and time costs, resulting in a conflict with the minimization of the costs. Moreover, the importance of these goals may vary relatively in different applications. Thus, we formulate a multi-objective optimization problem (MOP) to simultaneously minimize the mission completion time, signal strength towards the eavesdropper, and total energy cost of the UAVs. We prove that the formulated MOP is an NP-hard, mixed-variable optimization, and large-scale optimization problem. Thus, we propose a swarm intelligence-based algorithm to find a set of candidate solutions with different trade-offs which can meet various requirements in a low computational complexity. We also show that swarm intelligence methods need to enhance solution initialization, solution update, and algorithm parameter update phases when dealing with mixed-variable optimization and large-scale problems. Simulation results demonstrate the proposed algorithm outperforms state-of-the-art swarm intelligence algorithms and also show that the proposed method can reduce time and energy costs significantly compared with the benchmark strategies based on multi-hop and long-range flight.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=10195219,IEEE Transactions on Mobile Computing,2024
"Railway Intrusion Detection Based on Machine Vision: A Survey, Challenges, and Perspectives","Railway intrusion seriously threatens railway safety and can cause enormous loss of life and property. Therefore, railway intrusion detection is crucial for the safety of railway operation. Among the current methods of intrusion detection, machine vision-based methods have been widely used in railways, and have attracted close attention because of their great benefits. This paper proposes a comprehensive review of railway intrusion detection based on machine vision, covering ground monitoring, on-board inspection, and unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) inspection. First, this paper systematically reviews most of the studies over the past two decades and presents the survey in three parts. Second, by analyzing these studies and the requirements for railway monitoring, we summarize the major challenges that hinder railway intrusion detection based on machine vision. Finally, we propose several promising perspectives for railway intrusion detection based on machine vision by comprehensively considering the development of machine vision, sensors, and pattern recognition together with the needs of railway scenes.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=10565301,IEEE Transactions on Intelligent Transportation Systems,2024
Comparison of Scanning Strategies in UAV-Mounted Multichannel GPR-SAR Systems Using Antenna Arrays,"Ground penetrating radar (GPR) systems on board unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) have been successfully used for subsurface imaging applications. Their capability to detect buried targets avoiding the contact with the soil turn these systems into a great solution to detect buried threats, such as landmines and improvised explosive devices. Significant advances have been also conducted to enhance the detection capabilities of these systems, complementing the synthetic aperture radar (SAR) processing methods with several clutter mitigation techniques. However, the improvement in the scanning throughput (i.e., increasing the inspected area in a given time) remains a significant challenge. In this regard, this article compares several scanning strategies for UAV-mounted multichannel GPR-SAR systems using antenna arrays. In particular, two different scanning strategies have been compared: a uniform scheme and a nonuniform strategy called 3X. In addition, different across-track spacing values to generate dense and sparse sampling distributions were considered for each scanning scheme. After conducting a theoretical analysis of these strategies, they have been experimentally validated with measurements gathered with a portable scanner and during flights in realistic scenarios. Results show that the dense configurations of both scanning strategies yield good quality images of buried targets while improving the scanning throughput (compared to a single-channel architecture). In particular, the dense uniform scheme (with a 20-cm across-track spacing) achieves a greater reduction in the inspection time, compared to the dense 3X strategy, at the expense of a slightly smaller signal to clutter ratio.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=10384674,IEEE Journal of Selected Topics in Applied Earth Observations and Remote Sensing,2024
Dynamic Event-Triggered Consensus Cost-Based Switching Control for UAV Formation With Disturbances,"This article focuses on the scene wherein some of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) are destroyed by enemy attacks or accidental crash, the number of plentiful UAVs will reduce, and the communication topology along with the formation construction will change. By calculating the global consensus cost of the UAV formation, a cost-based switching law is designed to determine whether the UAV formation is switched or not. As regards the limited capacity of the network bandwidth, this article designs a distributed dynamic event-triggered mechanism to alleviate the transmission burden. By taking the whole disturbances into account, distributed disturbance observers are established to eliminate the negative influence for each UAV. By means of Kronecker product technique, an integrated controller is conducted for each UAV, which can achieve the consensus for the formation switched system and compensate for the unknown disturbances. On these basis, a closed-loop system with the designed controller and switching law is proved to be exponentially stable. Additionally, the explicit expressions of the controller and disturbance observers gains are determined, respectively. Finally, a simulation based on the UAVs is performed to validate that the designed control algorithm is effective.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=10365537,IEEE Transactions on Intelligent Vehicles,2024
A Multiobjective Optimization Algorithm for Safety and Optimality of 3-D Route Planning in UAV,"Finding a feasible path for an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) in a complex environment is a crucial part of any UAV mission planning system. Many algorithms have been developed to identify optimal or nearly optimal pathways for UAVs; however, the vast majority of those algorithms do not deal with this problem as multiobjective. Therefore, this study is presented to propose a new multiobjective optimization technique, namely the hybrid slime mould algorithm (HSMA), based on hybridizing the slime mould algorithm with a new updating mechanism to strengthen its performance when applied to tackle the multiobjective path planning problem in 3-D space. This algorithm employs Pareto optimality to tradeoff between various objectives. Those objectives include path optimality for minimizing the fuel cost and consumed time to reach the target location, flying away from threats to ensure safe operation, and finally the smooth cost to assess the climbing and turning rates. HSMA was evaluated using six benchmarking scenarios with various difficulty levels and compared to several recently published and well-established algorithms to show its effectiveness for several performance metrics, such as the convergence curve, Wilcoxon rank-sum test, and inverted generational distance metric. The experimental findings expose that HSMA is more effective than all the compared optimizers in terms of all performance metrics. Hence, it is the best alternative for efficiently creating high-quality pathways for UAVs.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=10436330,IEEE Transactions on Aerospace and Electronic Systems,2024
Robust Secure Precoding for UAV-Aided Multi-Beam Satellite NOMA Communications,"The wide coverage and broadcasting characteristics of satellite communications lead to multi-beam downlinks being vulnerable to security threats, such as eavesdropping, hacking and illegal access. This article takes into account the case of multiple users and an eavesdropper (Eve) in the target beam. In particular, we consider the deployment of an unmanned aerial vehicle to generate artificial noise in order to confuse Eve, while acting as a relay for the legitimate users. In addition, a non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) strategy is used to support multi-user communication and to improve the transmission rate. Considering the constraints due to quality of service, total and per-beam transmit power of the satellite, two robust secure precoding algorithms are presented to maximize the minimal achievable secrecy rate of the legitimate users for both non-critical and critical applications. Since the formulated optimization problems are non-convex, we first use the arithmetic-geometric mean inequality to solve the non-convex constraint of the successive interference cancellation decoding order, and the logarithmic parameter form is addressed by using the first-order Taylor series expansion. Besides, the secure outage probability constraint of the critical case is effectively resolved by applying the Bernstein-type inequality/decomposition-based large deviation inequality. Moreover, semi-definite relaxation and penalty function optimization methods are adopted to design the transmit power of the satellite in two cases, respectively. Simulation results verify the effectiveness and superiority of the proposed robust precoding design methods.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=10400829,IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology,2024
Track Correlation Algorithm Based on CNN-LSTM for Swarm Targets,"The rapid development of unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) swarm, a new type of aerial threat target, has brought great pressure to the air defense early warning system. At present, most of the track correlation algorithms only use part of the target location, speed, and other information for correlation. In this paper, the artificial neural network method is used to establish the corresponding intelligent track correlation model and method according to the characteristics of swarm targets. Precisely, a route correlation method based on convolutional neural networks (CNN) and long short-term memory (LSTM) Neural network is designed. In this model, the CNN is used to extract the formation characteristics of UAV swarm and the spatial position characteristics of single UAV track in the formation, while the LSTM is used to extract the time characteristics of UAV swarm. Experimental results show that compared with the traditional algorithms, the algorithm based on CNN-LSTM neural network can make full use of multiple feature information of the target, and has better robustness and accuracy for swarm targets.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=10530615,Journal of Systems Engineering and Electronics,2024

Velocity Consistency Checking Based GNSS Spoofing Detection Method for Vehicles,"Autonomous driving, unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), and various other vehicular navigation schemes heavily depend on the accurate position, velocity, and timing (PVT) information offered by global navigation satellite systems (GNSSs). Meanwhile, GNSS security is challenged by spoofing attacks that aim to deceive users by inducing false PVT solutions. Therefore, detecting these attacks on time is vital for vehicular navigation security. Spoofing attacks involve transmitting counterfeit signals from spoofers instead of authentic satellites, making it difficult to coordinate spatial information accurately. To this end, the Doppler shift, revealing spatial features between transmitters and receivers, is regarded as an effective metric for spoofing detection. Especially for vehicles, due to their motion relative to the spoofer, Doppler bias is appended to the raw measurement, providing an observable spoofing signature. Conventional approaches tend to directly monitor the Doppler bias but require complex requirements like static initialization, random motion, and multiple receivers. Moreover, the commonly utilized single-antenna assumption renders them ineffective against multi-antenna spoofing attacks. This paper proposes a new approach that indirectly exploits the Doppler bias by examining its adverse impact on velocity consistency. The introduced direct velocity determination (DVD) method calculates velocity directly from the Doppler measurements, which is then utilized for consistency-checking alongside the velocity obtained from the conventional pseudorange-aided approach. We thoroughly investigate the impact of Doppler bias on velocities and analyze their consistency across different scenarios. Field tests validate the effectiveness of the proposed method, surpassing previous Doppler-based methods and the widely used receiver autonomous integrity monitoring (RAIM) method.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85174822703&origin=inward,IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology,2024
Evaluation Framework for Electric Vehicle Security Risk Assessment,"Electric Vehicles (EVs) seem promising for future transportation to solve environmental concerns and energy management problems. According to Reuters, global car makers plan to invest over half a billion in more efficient and intelligent EVs and batteries. However, there are several challenges in EV mass production, including cybersecurity. Due to the cyber-physical nature of EVs and charging stations, their security and trustworthiness are ongoing challenges. In this study, we identify gaps in the security profiling of EVs and categorize them into five components: 1) charging station security, 2) information privacy, 3) software security, 4) connected vehicle security, and 5) autonomous driving security. Our study provides a comprehensive analysis of identified vulnerabilities, threats, challenges and attacks for different EV security aspects, along with their possible surface/subsurface and countermeasures. We develop a comprehensive security risk assessment framework by first using EV security profiles and mapping identified vulnerabilities to a well-known threat model, STRIDE. Then, we classify the risk levels associated with each vulnerability by setting ground criteria for the impact and likelihood of the threats. Finally, we validate our risk assessment framework by applying the same criteria to eight real-world EV attack scenarios. As a result, researchers can adapt the proposed risk assessment framework to discover threats and assess their risks in EVs and charging station ecosystems.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=10247152,IEEE Transactions on Intelligent Transportation Systems,2024
liteGAP: Lightweight Group Authentication Protocol for Internet of Drones Systems,"Over the past few years, the synergic usage of unmanned aerial vehicles (later drones) and Internet of Things (IoT) has successfully transformed into the Internet of Drones (IoD) paradigm, where the data of interest is gathered and delivered to the Zone Service Provider (ZSP) by drones for substantial additional analysis. Considering the sensitivity of collected information and the impact of information disclosure, information privacy and security issues should be resolved properly so that the maximum potential of IoD can be realized in the increasingly complex cyber threat environment. Ideally, an authentication and key agreement protocol can be adopted to establish secure communications between drones and the ZSP in an insecure environment. Nevertheless, a large group of drones authenticating with the ZSP simultaneously will lead to a severe authentication signaling congestion, which inevitably degrades the quality of service (QoS) of IoD systems. To properly address the above-mentioned issues, a lightweight group authentication protocol, called liteGAP, is proposed in this paper. liteGAP can achieve the authenticated key establishment between a group of drones and the ZSP concurrently in the IoD environment using lightweight operations such as hash function, bitwise XOR, and physical unclonable function (PUF). We verify liteGAP using AVISPA (a tool for the automatic verification of security protocols) and conduct formal and informal security analysis, proving that liteGAP meets all pre-defined security requirements and withstand various potential cyber attacks. Moreover, we develop an experimental framework and conduct extensive experiments on liteGAP and two benchmark schemes (e.g., GASE and rampIoD). Experimental findings show that liteGAP outperforms its counterparts in terms of computational cost as well as communication overhead.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=10325618,IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology,2024

Area Surveillance With Low Detection Probability Using UAV Swarms,"Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) deployed as a swarm can offer a flexible and cost-efficient solution for surveillance missions in large-scale adversarial environments. UAV swarms possess superior real-time surveillance capabilities in detecting time-sensitive targets with speed and security, surpassing alternative techniques such as satellites and ground-based sensors. However, the area surveillance problem in adversarial scenarios using UAV swarms necessitates careful consideration of factors such as swarm positioning, flight attitudes, antenna directionality, the threat posed by adversary detection systems (ADSs), and swarm network topology. To address this challenge, we propose the Integrated Low Detection Probability (ILDP) deployment method for UAV swarms, which incorporates the Danger Avoidance Distributed Motion control algorithm (DADM) for swarm collaboration and the Low Detection Probability Topology Control algorithm (LDPTC) for swarm networking. The DADM algorithm facilitates swarm cooperation in achieving area coverage and evading ADSs by leveraging neighboring, environmental, and threat information in adversarial scenarios. Furthermore, the LDPTC algorithm establishes a topology optimization model that comprehensively considers swarm distribution and the impact of directional antenna sidelobes to reduce transmitting energy leakage on the ground. Our strategy significantly decreases the detection probability of UAV swarms by ADSs, ensuring the operational effectiveness of UAV swarms in dynamic adversarial scenarios. Extensive simulations validate the superiority of our proposed ILDP method, demonstrating considerably lower detection probabilities compared to other approaches in static and dynamic adversary environments across various swarm scales. Moreover, our method excels in real-time surveillance capabilities with lower computational complexity, freeing up computing resources for UAVs to fulfill additional tasks.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85173013357&origin=inward,IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology,2024
Malicious Data Traceability and Throughput Optimization Using Blockchain (IOTA Smart Contracts) for Next Generation Internet of Vehicles,"The Internet of Vehicles (IoV) faces security threats from malicious entities that endanger vehicles. However, traditional centralized networks have limitations in scalability, latency, and security. Decentralized blockchain architectures provide an alternative, though conventional blockchains also have restrictions. We develop an architecture based on IOTA's Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) ledger tailored to IoV needs to enhance traceability, throughput, and security. The goal is to leverage IOTA's decentralized, high throughput, low latency design to overcome limitations in existing IoV networks. We propose an IOTA-based model using smart contracts for malicious data/user tracing and timing side-channels for attack detection. We adaptively schedule data to optimize throughput based on traffic conditions. Our simulations compare throughput, latency, and attack detection across varied scenarios. Our results demonstrate that the architecture enables automated security via decentralized consensus, avoiding centralized failures. The smart contracts facilitate real-time threat tracing and mitigation. Timing analysis reveals IOTA's ability to identify attacks through latency fluctuations. Optimized data transfer scheduling adapts to congestion levels. Overall, integrating reputation systems, smart contracts, and IOTA's innovations significantly improves security, efficiency, and scalability compared to centralized and blockchain IoV networks. This work advances IoV security by outlining a comprehensive blockchain solution leveraging IOTA's unique capabilities. The decentralized mechanisms enhance traceability and trust while optimizing performance tailored to vehicular demands.

Human-Assisted Resilient Coordination for Automated Platoon With False Data Injection Attack,"This paper investigates the resilient platooning problem of connected and automated vehicles (CAVs) under false-data injection (FDI) attacks. These attacks can alter the system state of any vehicle within a platoon at any time, presenting a significant challenge. To tackle this, we introduce a human-assisted resilient coordination (HARC) approach for CAVs, comprised of three core modules: a joint attack detection mechanism, a human-assisted coordination scheme, and a distributed optimization-based control module. The attack detection approach monitors vehicles at two distinct levels - local communication and global communication. Our human-assisted coordination strategy is designed not only to respond efficiently to attacks but also to ensure seamless coordination of the vehicle platoon, thereby preventing accidents and enhancing flexibility. By incorporating human input, we bolster the resilience and security of platoon coordination. Moreover, we present a distributed optimization-based control technique tailored specifically for constrained CAVs. A resilience constraint is designed and incorporated into the optimization problem, thereby empowering CAVs to identify adversarial communication channels via a localized communication detector. We provide experimental results to showcase the effectiveness of our proposed approach and to highlight its implications for resilient platooning under FDI attacks.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=10648953,IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology,2024

UAV-Assisted MEC System With Mobile Ground Terminals: DRL-Based Joint Terminal Scheduling and UAV 3D Trajectory Design,"In this paper, we investigate an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV)-assisted edge computing network in a sophisticated three-dimensional (3D) scenario, e.g., a post-disaster urban area with multiple mobile ground terminals (GTs) for resilience. The mission of the UAV is to first collect a set of computation tasks from multiple GT sources, then process them and make joint decisions (computation results) which are finally transmitted to another set of GT destinations. An efficient design is provided aiming at minimizing the total time cost including costs for the task offloading, computations, and decision transmissions, via jointly designing the UAV's trajectory and the scheduling of communications from and to different GTs. In particular, we take into account the practical assumptions on the GTs' mobility, on the obstacle avoidance to 3D buildings, and on that the UAV is possible to fly among buildings, i.e., the flying altitude can be lower than the buildings' heights. To address the established complex and non-convex problem, we first provide a problem transformation by exploiting Markov decision process (MDP), and then propose a deep reinforcement learning (DRL) approach-based solution with a multi-step dueling DDQN (D3QN) method. As a result, an efficient solution is achieved, where the UAV acts as the agent to continuously explore and improve its mobile strategy during interacting with the environment under the proposed method. The simulation results show the advantages of the proposed 3D trajectory design in comparison to a 2D one. In addition, the results confirm the robustness of the proposed design in terms of different GTs' mobility models and UAV flying height/area limits, and illustrate the superiority of unrestricted feasible domains for the UAV flight.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=10480601,IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology,2024
Robust Trajectory and Offloading for Energy-Efficient UAV Edge Computing in Industrial Internet of Things,"Efficient data processing and computation are essential for the Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) to empower various applications, which can be significantly bottlenecked by the limited energy capacity and computation capability of the IIoT nodes. In this article, we employ an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) as an edge server to assist IIoT data processing, while considering the practical issue of UAV jittering. Specifically, we propose a joint design on trajectory and offloading strategies to minimize energy consumption due to local and edge computation, as well as data transmission. We particularly address UAV jittering that induces Gaussian-distributed uncertainties associated with flying waypoints, resulting in probabilistic-form flying speed and data offloading constraints. We exploit the Bernstein-type inequality to reformulate the constraints in deterministic forms and decompose the energy minimization to solve for trajectory and offloading separately within an alternating optimization framework. The subproblems are then tackled with the successive convex approximation technique. Simulation results show that our proposal strictly guarantees robustness under uncertainties and effectively reduces energy consumption as compared with the baselines.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=10068215,IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics,2024
Integrated Host- and Content-Centric Routing for Efficient and Scalable Networking of UAV Swarm,"Efficient and scalable networking is a key enabler of the Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) swarms, wherein multiple UAVs cooperatively execute complicated tasks. Despite the intermittent connections due to the UAV mobility, stable paths may exist temporally in periods like formation keeping, which is rarely considered or utilized in existing UAV routing designs. In this article, we propose an integrated host- and content-centric routing (IHCR) mechanism to harness the advantages of both routing mechanisms. Specifically, the routing information of stable paths is reused in a host-centric manner to reduce the flooding for path exploring. In addition, the route failure detection and re-routing are content-centric to adjust to the topology dynamics. The challenges lie in the inherent contradiction between host-centric and content-centric routing mechanisms (e.g., naming spaces) and the tradeoff between path reusing and re-routing. To overcome these challenges, we appropriately incorporate node names into content names and then fully exploit reusable paths via time-based route failure detection and delayed forwarding. Packet-level simulation results show that IHCR increases the packet delivery ratio by 60.1%, and enlarges the achievable network scale by 4.2 times compared to state-of-the-art routing mechanisms.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85153799448&origin=inward,IEEE Transactions on Mobile Computing,2024
Scalable-MADDPG-Based Cooperative Target Invasion for a Multi-USV System,"This article concentrates on proposing a scalable deep reinforcement learning (DRL) method for a multiple unmanned surface vehicle (multi-USV) system to operate cooperative target invasion. The multi-USV system, which is made up of multiple invaders, needs to invade target areas in a specified time. A novel scalable reinforcement learning (RL) method called Scalable-MADDPG is proposed for the first time. In this method, the scale of the multi-USV system can be changed at any time without interrupting the training process. Then, to mitigate the policy oscillation after applying Scalable-MADDPG, a bi-directional long–short-term memory (Bi-LSTM) network is constructed. Moreover, an improved  $\epsilon $ -greedy strategy is proposed to help balance the exploration and exploitation in RL. Furthermore, to enhance the robustness of the optimal policy, Ornstein–Uhlenbeck (OU) noise is added in this improved  $\epsilon $ -greedy strategy during the training process. Finally, the scalable RL method is used to help the multi-USV system perform cooperative target invasion under complex marine environments.

A distributed model predictive formation control method is developed for UAVs with obstacle avoidance. Unlike most existing trajectory tracking control schemes, the proposed method is derived from a smooth shifting function and a distributed Lyapunov-based model predictive controller, together with two collision-free functions, to obtain an improved control algorithm with the following characteristics: 1) the swarm system of UAVs realizes the cooperative hunting process from tracking formation to containing formation, fencing a target to their convex hull; 2) the Lyapunov-based model predictive formation control method inherits the stability properties of backstepping technique and adopts the receding horizon optimization of model predictive control (MPC) technique; and 3) by exploiting the Lyapunov-based MPC algorithm and collision-free functions, the swarm system of UAVs can avoid collision with obstacles or collision with each other in 3-D scenarios with multiple obstacles. Finally, the simulation and comparison results confirm that the proposed controller outperforms the traditional backstepping controller in terms of safety and tracking performance.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=10433443,"IEEE Transactions on Systems, Man, and Cybernetics: Systems",2024
Deep Reinforcement Learning With Dynamic Graphs for Adaptive Informative Path Planning,"Autonomousrobots are often employed for data collection due to their efficiency and low labour costs. A key task in robotic data acquisition is planning paths through an initially unknown environment to collect observations given platform-specific resource constraints, such as limited battery life. Adaptive online path planning in 3D environments is challenging due to the large set of valid actions and the presence of unknown occlusions. To address these issues, we propose a novel deep reinforcement learning approach for adaptively replanning robot paths to map targets of interest in unknown 3D environments. A key aspect of our approach is a dynamically constructed graph that restricts planning actions local to the robot, allowing us to react to newly discovered static obstacles and targets of interest. For replanning, we propose a new reward function that balances between exploring the unknown environment and exploiting online-discovered targets of interest. Our experiments show that our method enables more efficient target discovery compared to state-of-the-art learning and non-learning baselines. We also showcase our approach for orchard monitoring using an unmanned aerial vehicle in a photorealistic simulator.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=10578000,IEEE Robotics and Automation Letters,2024
3D Trajectory Optimization for Multimission UAVs in Smart City Scenarios,"There is a definite possibility that, in a recent future, Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) will form the backbone of any smart city in terms of automation and networking. One approach to extend the UAVs’ resources spectrum is to provide a mean for them to opportunistically recharge and connect to otherwise unreachable networks: provide Training and Recharge Areas (TRAs). In these dedicated areas, the UAVs could dock to Energy and Data Dispensers (EDD) devices to resupply their batteries and exploit a high-speed connection. To autonomously move through the smart city while accomplishing a set of given tasks but, at the same time, consider visiting the EDDs, is part of a tridimensional trajectory planning problem that needs to be addressed. In this paper, we formally define the combinatorial optimization problem representing the trajectory planning. We consider the case in which more than one UAV can be connected with the same EDD at the same time, by properly addressing the assignment of the bandwidth. Through simulative investigation, realistic values for the solution of the optimization problem are found. The behavior of the proposed model is compared with an ”online” approach that does not require the same resources and knowledge and whose evaluation and comparison with the ”offline” approach are performed through network simulation.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9925115,IEEE Transactions on Mobile Computing,2024
Secure Ultra-Reliable and Low Latency Communication in UAV-Enabled NOMA Wireless Networks,"Combing unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) with nonorthogonal multiple access (NOMA) in ultra-reliable and low latency communication (uRLLC) is deemed as a new service category of 5G wireless networks. The openness nature of wireless environment makes security of information transmission unprecedentedly importance. Traditional cryptography methods cannot cater to uRLLC due to high complex design and processing delay. As a result, physical layer security (PLS) has been designed to secure information transmission by exploiting intrinsic property of wireless channel. However, many prior works ignored the role of UAV in study of PLS in uRLLC, and mobility of UAV deserves further investigation. This paper studies security and reliability performances of UAV-based uRLLC by using NOMA, where two kinds of users with different requirements are served, i.e., users with privacy and low latency requirement (PLR), and users with reliability and low latency requirement (RLR). With the tools of stochastic geometry, we formulate the secrecy rate, a popular metric in study of PLS, by establishing the closed-form expressions for static and dynamic UAV. Key system parameters (e.g., transmit power allocation) are optimized for secrecy rate maximization. Simulations evaluate theoretical analysis and give a significant insight into a positive secrecy rate for the network designer.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=10561528,IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology,2024
Driving Visual Saliency Prediction of Dynamic Night Scenes via a Spatio-Temporal Dual-Encoder Network,"Driving at night is more challenging and dangerous than driving during the day. Modeling driver eye movement and attention allocation during night driving can help guide unmanned intelligent vehicles and improve safety during similar situations. However, until now, few studies have modeled a drivers’ true fixations and attention allocation in specific night circumstance. Therefore, we collected an eye tracking dataset from 30 experienced drivers while they viewed night driving videos under a hypothetical driving condition, termed Driver Fixation Dataset in night (DrFixD(night)). Based on DrFixD(night) which includes multiple drivers’ attention allocation, we proposed a spatio-temporal dual-encoder network model, named as STDE-Net, to improve saliency detection in night driving condition. The model includes three modules: i) spatio-temporal dual encoding module, ii) fusion module based on attention mechanism, and iii) decoding module. A convolutional LSTM is employed to learn the time connection of video sequences, and a convolution neural network combined pyramid dilated convolution is adopted to extract spatial features in the spatio-temporal dual encoding module. The attention mechanism is exploited to fuse the temporal and spatial features together and selectively highlight the significant features in night traffic scene. We compared the proposed model with other traditional methods and deep learning models, both qualitatively and quantitatively, and found that the proposed model can predict driver’s fixation more accurately. Specifically, the proposed model not only predicts the main goals, but also predicts the important sub goals, such as pedestrians, bicycles and so on, showing excellent prediction of dimly lit targets at night.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=10287215,IEEE Transactions on Intelligent Transportation Systems,2024
UAV-Aided Secure Communication With Imperfect Eavesdropper Location: Robust Design for Jamming Power and Trajectory,"This paper exploits the mobility of an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) to improve the physical layer (PLS) security against potential eavesdropping scenarios, where the sensitive data transmitted from a ground base station (GBS) to multiple information receivers (IRs) is easily eavesdropped by multiple non-colluding eavesdroppers (Eves). Specifically, the UAV is employed as a friendly jammer to transmit artificial noise to degrade the wiretap channels. By leveraging the UAV's mobility and the possibility of establishing line-of-sight links, the UAV can move close to the Eves and opportunistically jam them. Especially, two practical factors, namely, the imperfect location information of Eves and the existence of no-fly zones are considered. Since only the partial position information of the Eves can be known, as the worst case, the minimum average secrecy rate of IRs is robustly optimized by jointly designing the trajectory and jamming power of the UAV, and the transmission power of the GBS to ensure the security of all IRs. However, the formulated problem with coupled variables is non-convex and intractable. As such, an efficient alternative iterative suboptimal algorithm is proposed to solve this problem by applying the block coordinate descent, successive convex approximation, slack variables, and $\mathcal {S}$-Procedure. Numerical results reveal that the proposed robust algorithm can substantially improve the max-min average secrecy rate, and the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm is further verified by comparing it with three benchmark schemes.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85181572608&origin=inward,IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology,2024
A UAV-Centric Improved Soft Actor-Critic Algorithm for QoE-Focused Aerial Video Streaming,"The increasing demand for uninterrupted connectivity emphasises the pivotal role of Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) in facilitating real-time video streaming, despite the challenges associated with highly dynamic air-to-ground communications. Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL)-based solutions (on-policy) are designed to optimize specific quality of experience (QoE) objectives, such as video quality and smoothness when networks fluctuate. However, they are vulnerable to different hyperparameters and have poor sample efficiency. To overcome this problem, we propose an improved off-policy soft actor-critic (SAC) solution, named I-SAC, which provides an exceptional exploration-exploitation trade-off for UAV-based aerial video streaming. I-SAC trains a neural network by jointly considering the video playback status, UAV flight metrics like altitude, velocity, and acceleration, as well as prior network conditions with the goal of maximizing the overall QoE. We design a new QoE metric that considers video quality, video quality oscillations, re-buffering, latency, and bandwidth utilization. We evaluate I-SAC with extensive real-world bandwidth settings, UAV flights, and multi-duration segment datasets. The trace-driven simulation results demonstrate that I-SAC significantly outperforms the closest on-policy and off-policy DRL-based alternative solutions in terms of QoE. Specifically, I-SAC achieves average QoE improvements of up to 54.32% under different testing scenarios.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=10536624,IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology,2024
Dynamic Energy Management for UAV-Enabled VR Systems: A Tile-Based Collaboration Approach,"Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) have been envisioned as a promising technology to support wireless virtual reality (VR) applications. However, the huge energy consumption during the rendering process is challenging for UAV-enabled VR systems. The existing energy management strategies neglecting the dynamic and tiling features of VR tasks may not achieve optimal performance. To cope with these issues, we present a dynamic energy optimization framework for UAV-enabled VR systems. In the proposed framework, a tile-based collaborative rendering scheme for multi-UAVs is developed by exploiting the correlation among different tiles of VR users. Further, we formulate an optimization problem by jointly considering the collaboration decision, resource allocation, and UAV trajectory, aiming to reduce the long-term energy consumption under the motion-to-photon (MTP) latency requirement. Due to the tight coupling variables and the dynamic factors, the formulated problem is non-convex and difficult to tackle by adopting the traditional method. To this end, we first decompose the original problem into two sub-problems, i.e., the UAV trajectory and collaboration decision (UTCD) problem, and the resource allocation (RA) problem. Then, we design a dynamic UTCD algorithm based on deep reinforcement learning (DRL) and present an optimal RA algorithm based on the Lagrangian multiplier iterative (LMI) method. To enhance the solving efficiency, a block coordinate descent (BCD)-based solving method is introduced by embedding the RA algorithm in the learning environment of DRL. Finally, simulation results prove that the proposed scheme can obtain good performance for UAV-enabled VR systems.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=10603411,IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology,2024
Unmanned Aerial Vehicle Aided Batteryless Covert Communications: A Robust Design Against Cooperative Hostile Detection,"An unmanned-aerial-vehicle (UAV) is exploited for securely collecting sensing data from massively deployed batteryless devices on the ground. Specifically, signals emitted by the UAV have the following functions: jamming hostile wardens (HWs) and powering legitimate devices (LDs). The transmit power of both the LDs and the UAV as well as the UAV's flying trajectory are jointly optimised for maximising the uplink throughput of data collection, while ensuring that the uplink transmissions of LDs to the UAV cannot be detected by HWs. The formulated optimisation problem is difficult to solve due to its non-convexity. Therefore, a successive convex approximation (SCA) based alternating optimisation (AO) is proposed for obtaining a near-optimal solution. In our design, the UAV does not need the exact locations of the HWs, while it is robust to the optimal cooperative detection among the HWs with a greedy scheduling (GS) based algorithm. The numerical results demonstrate that the uplink-throughput can be substantially improved by our joint design.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=10488681,IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology,2024
Robust Beamforming and Phase Shift Optimization for RIS-Assisted UAV Multiuser MISO Communication Networks,"Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) are emerging as promising platforms to provide flexible and low-cost services for ground users of hard-to-reach areas in the era of 6G. Nevertheless, the limited battery life of UAVs poses a significant challenge when it comes to establishing reliable air-ground connections. A potential solution to address this challenge is to exploit reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (RIS), wherein RIS planes are affixed on UAVs to enhance energy efficiency. However, this scheme is subject to unwanted UAV oscillations. This paper presents a robust optimization framework for RIS-assisted UAV multiuser multiple-input single-output (MISO) communication networks while considering the practical undesired oscillations for UAV. Specifically, we formulate a weighted sum rate (WSR) maximization problem by jointly optimizing the transmit beamforming of the base station (BS) and the phase shift of RIS under UAV's undesired oscillations. To effectively tackle the intricate non-convex nature of the problem, we propose a robust block coordinate Lagrangian dual transform (RoBl) scheme by leveraging the block coordinate descent (BCD) and Lagrangian dual transform. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed scheme can achieve a superior WSR compared to the state-of-the-art benchmarks, and confirm the effectiveness and robustness of our proposed scheme.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=10526452,IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology,2024
Energy-Efficient 3-D UAV Ground Node Accessing Using the Minimum Number of UAVs,"Cooperative multiple unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) have been widely exploited in various applications, including data collection, forest monitoring, edge computing, and so on. Due to limited onboard storage and expensive hardware costs, reducing both the energy consumption and the number of UAVs is critical for these multi-UAV applications. However, existing studies primarily revolved around energy minimization in two-dimensional (2-D) scenarios, given a sufficient but fixed number of UAVs, and most of them considered specific application scenarios, resulting in poor generality. In contrast, this paper defines a generalized application scenario, in which multiple ground nodes (GNs) are accessed by multiple UAVs in three-dimensional (3-D) scenarios, and aims to minimize the energy consumption by employing the necessary (or equivalently minimum) number of UAVs and formulating a mix-integer nonconvex problem. To this end, this paper decomposes the problem into two subproblems: energy consumption minimization for a single UAV consecutively accessing any two GNs and energy-efficient multi-UAV GN-accessing path planning employing the minimum number of UAVs. The first subproblem is solved by applying the successive convex approximation (SCA) technique and the path discretization method, while the second subproblem is addressed by designing a three-stage approximation framework based on modified particle swarm optimization (MPSO) and greedy path assignment (GPA). Comprehensive simulations demonstrate the superior performance of the proposed method in terms of optimality and efficiency compared to several other counterparts.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=10539333,IEEE Transactions on Mobile Computing,2024
Graph Convolutional Flocking Control for Unmanned Aerial Vehicles With Packet Dropouts,"Flocking control of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) plays a vital role in numerous applications with its adaptability, decentralization, and self-organization. Despite advances, the control performance of present approaches will deteriorate in practical applications due to the disregard of the strong coupling of the complexity of the UAVs (e.g., nonlinearity and strong coupling), agent interaction, and network quality (e.g., time delay and packet dropouts). To address this problem, we propose a novel graph convolutional flocking strategy for nonlinear UAV systems in the event of stochastic packet dropouts over the communication network. Different from the existing methods that only rely on a nominal model, this article formulates the flocking control problem from the perspective of an underlying graph, and exploits the graph convolution to generate a contextualized representation of the spatiotemporal state-control space. A predictive model of packet dropouts is generated with the state-control sequences in the learned representation space. Consequently, a graph convolutional flocking controller including a packet dropout predictive compensation module is proposed. The stability of the closed-loop system is verified by Lyapunov theory. Simulation and physical-world experimental studies for flocking control of a multiquadcopter system are performed to verify the effectiveness of our proposed strategy.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=10472887,IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics,2024
All-Sky Autonomous Computing in UAV Swarm,"Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) play an essential role in emergency cases and adverse environments for applications like disaster detection and mine exploration. To process the massive volume of sensing data generated by various sensory payloads in these applications, existing works either compress deep learning (DL) models to conduct onboard computing, or offload raw data back to the resourceful ground station with the help of relay UAVs due to base station damage. However, the former sacrifices the inference accuracy of DL models (up to 10% accuracy loss), while the latter achieves high accuracy at the cost of significant latency, due to limited wireless communication resources in the multi-hop transmission. To address the problem, exploiting the resources of the UAV swarm including both task UAVs and relay UAVs, we build up an all-sky autonomous computing (ASAP) system to autonomously conduct collaborative computing in the swarm, to achieve both high accuracy and low latency of sensing data processing. In detail, we first propose a novel UAV swarm-native collaborative computing architecture, considering the general hierarchy and clustering structure of UAV swarms, as well as the characteristic of DL model execution. We then design an elastic efficient task scheduler to allocate computing tasks for UAVs, and update the scheduling scheme online when some UAVs are unavailable, with the aid of a lightweight and accurate DL inference performance predictor. Finally, we design an adaptive inter-UAV data compressor, to adapt to the limited and dynamic communication resources between UAVs. Experiment results on 24 airborne computers and five real-world UAVs show that, the proposed system can perform collaborative computing in a timely manner and effectively deal with situations when some UAVs become unavailable.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85199054546&origin=inward,IEEE Transactions on Mobile Computing,2024
Offloading of Tasks With Tight Delay Requirements via Combined Half and Full Duplex UAV Relays,"In this paper, we focus on offloading of computationally demanding tasks with tight processing delay requirements (hundreds of ms) from user equipments (UEs) to multi-access edge computing servers while exploiting unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) as relays. Traditionally addressed problem jointly optimizing an offloading decision and an association of the UEs to the UAVs is, in our work, enriched by optimization of the relaying via UAVs through selection between half-duplex (HD) and full-duplex (FD) under a constraint on the maximum processing delay of individual tasks. To solve this complex problem, we also optimize the length of relaying time slots in HD and the transmission power allocation for the UEs and the UAVs in FD. Then, we transform the problem to one-to-many matching and propose a low-complexity greedy algorithm for the joint offloading decision and UEs association solved together with the duplex selection. We show that our proposal reduces the sum energy consumed by the UEs and UAVs for the tasks offloading by up to 40% compared to related works.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=10508505,IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology,2024
Wi-Fi-Based Real-Time UAV Localization: A Comparative Analysis Between RSSI-Based and FTM-Based Approaches,"Wi-Fi connectivity for localization purposes has been used for several years in the Internet of Things (IoT) context, where the (general) static nature of IoT devices allows to approximately localize them in known environments with low effort and implementation costs. While the accuracy of Wi-Fi localization for IoT applications can be considered as acceptable, the adoption of Wi-Fi-based localization for (a highly mobile) unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) has received limited attention. In this article, a low-cost and low-complexity system architecture is proposed and exploited to perform a comparative analysis between two Wi-Fi-based localization approaches: the traditional received signal strength indicator (RSSI) ranging and the more recent fine time measurement (FTM), based on the IEEE 802.11mc amendment. Our goal is to estimate and compare the efficacy of the proposed system for real-time positioning of a static or moving UAV, evaluating the impact of different filtering solutions on the localization accuracy. The obtained results show that FTM-based localization is more accurate, reducing the positioning error by 37% with respect to the RSSI-based positioning approach. Our results also confirm the better overall performance of the FTM-based solution for low-cost localization applications, discussing its limitations, scalability, and advantages as a viable backup positioning solution in (weak or denied) Global Navigation Satellite System-based environments and scenarios.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85199553822&origin=inward,IEEE Transactions on Aerospace and Electronic Systems,2024
Symmetry-Augmented Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning for Scalable UAV Trajectory Design and User Scheduling,"Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) as mobile base stations are recognized as effective means for emergency communications. The performance of such systems depends on the movement of UAVs and scheduling of ground users (GUs). However, devising an efficient algorithm to jointly optimize UAV trajectories and user scheduling is still challenging, especially in real-time scenarios lacking central controllers. Multi-agent deep reinforcement learning (MADRL) provides a promising solution to this problem. Nevertheless, as the numbers of UAVs and GUs increase, existing MADRL algorithms encounter scalability and sample efficiency issues. In this paper, we develop a novel symmetry-augmented MADRL approach for learning scalable UAV trajectory design and user scheduling policies. The core idea is to utilize symmetries to reduce the multi-agent state-action space and enhance sample efficiency. Specifically, we design a family of neural networks to learn individual policies, namely entity permutation equivariant policy networks (EP2Nets). EP2Nets effectively leverage the permutation symmetry to reduce redundancy in the state-action space. Additionally, we achieve data augmentation by exploiting rotational and reflection symmetries, further boosting sample efficiency. Finally, a Symmetric QMIX (SymmQMIX) algorithm is proposed by integrating the EP2Net and data augmentation method into the QMIX algorithm. Simulation results indicate that SymmQMIX significantly outperforms QMIX and other symmetry-enhanced algorithms, achieving a 4.5-fold increase in converged performance and a 100-fold improvement in sample efficiency.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85200825813&origin=inward,IEEE Transactions on Mobile Computing,2024
Transmission Line Component Defect Detection Based on UAV Patrol Images: A Self-Supervised HC-ViT Method,"The unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) patrol inspection has become an efficient method to ensure the operation condition of transmission lines. The detection of key components with defects in transmission lines is a critical task in maintaining a power system’s stability. However, the complex inspection environment and the imbalance between the number of normal component samples and that of defect samples significantly affect the detection accuracy. In this article, we present a novel method for defect detection in UAV patrol images, based on a hierarchical convolutional vision transformer (HC-ViT) and a simple contrastive masked autoencoder (SC-MAE). The HC-ViT backbone integrates the advantages of vision transformer and convolution, while the SC-MAE is a self-supervised learning method that extracts useful features from normal samples. By introducing the normal features into the backbone, we enhance the performance of the defect detection task. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our method through experiments, and show that it can leverage a large amount of unlabeled normal images, reducing the need for manual annotation. Our method offers a new way to exploit the potential features of patrol inspection images.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=10509861,"IEEE Transactions on Systems, Man, and Cybernetics: Systems",2024
Distributed Adaptive Event-Triggered Control of Connected Automated Vehicle Platoon Systems With Spoofing Cyber Attacks,"Due to the utilization of Cellular Vehicle-to-Everything (C-V2X) wireless communication network, the communication process of connected automated vehicle platoon systems is susceptible to external malicious attacks. This paper proposes an effective distributed control framework for connected automated vehicle platoon systems in the presence of spoofing cyber attacks. Firstly, Bernoulli random variables are utilized to model the random nature of spoofing attacks within the platoon systems, and an adaptive event-based communication strategy is adopted to optimize network resource utilization and prevent redundant information transmission. Secondly, a distributed state-feedback controller is designed, leveraging both the adaptive event-triggered approach and the linear matrix inequality (LMI) approach, considering the influence of random and energy-limited spoofing attacks. Thirdly, through the application of the Lyapunov stability theory, the system with the platooning controller, despite the presence of spoofing cyber attacks, is proved to be asymptotically stable. Finally, numerical examples are presented to demonstrate the feasibility and effectiveness of the proposed controller.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85208265177&origin=inward,IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology,2024
IdentifierIDS: A Practical Voltage-Based Intrusion Detection System for Real In-Vehicle Networks,"As innovative technologies such as autonomous driving, over-the-air technology, and vehicle-to-everything are widely applied to intelligent connected vehicles, people can gain a more convenient and safer driving experience. Although the application of these technologies facilitates our lives, they also bring a series of vulnerable interfaces (such as 5G, Bluetooth, and WiFi), which pose a significant security threat to existing in-vehicle networks. To address these threats, researchers have proposed two mainstream schemes, including message authentication and intrusion detection system (IDS), where the scheme of message authentication needs to occupy the limited bandwidth of controller area network (CAN) bus. Furthermore, most IDSs either cannot locate the sender of the attack, fail to detect aperiodic malicious frames, or require prior knowledge of which CAN identifiers (IDs) belong to which electronic control units (ECUs). To address these weaknesses, we propose a practical voltage-based IDS named IdentifierIDS for real in-vehicle networks. To the best of our knowledge, it is the first scheme to detect intrusions by establishing a voltage fingerprint for each ID without the need for prior knowledge. This allows IdentifierIDS to detect both periodic and aperiodic malicious frames without occupying the limited bandwidth of the CAN bus. As a self-learning IDS, it can adapt to different in-vehicle networks without the need for customization for them. Experiments on three real vehicles demonstrate the robustness of our scheme in different in-vehicle networks.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=10292666,IEEE Transactions on Information Forensics and Security,2024
Edge-Based Event-Triggered Platooning Control of Heterogeneous Connected Automated Vehicles Under Replay Attacks,"This paper investigates the problem of secure platooning control of heterogeneous connected automated vehicles under replay attacks. An edge-based dynamic event-triggered mechanism (DETM) is developed to relieve the vehicle-to-vehicle communication burden among the connected platoon. Different from the widely used constant time headway policies, a refined constant time headway (RCTH) policy that leverages the relative velocity between adjacent vehicles is adopted to enhance platooning safety while preserving traffic efficiency. To deal with the discrepancy of vehicle dynamic parameters, heterogeneity compensators are developed for each platoon member to estimate the platoon leader's state. By virtue of the switching system theory, the desired parameters of heterogeneity compensators are designed and the tolerable condition of replay attacks is also established. Furthermore, sufficient design criteria are derived to obtain the local compensator-based controller gains under the proposed edge-based DETM and RCTH policy. It is further proved that Zeno freeness of the proposed edge-based DETMs is excluded. Finally, co-simulations of Matlab/Simulink and CarSim are carried out to verify the efficacy of the derived results.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=10577479,IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology,2024
Neurodynamics-Based Attack-Defense Guidance of Autonomous Surface Vehicles Against Multiple Attackers for Domain Protection,"This article investigates an adversarial domain protection scenario involving multiple defending underactuated autonomous surface vehicles (ASVs) against an equal number of attacking ASVs in an obstructive environment. The defending ASVs can only obtain the positions of the attacking ASVs susceptible of stochastic measurement noises. A three-layer attack-defense guidance structure is proposed such that the defending ASVs are able to intercept the attacking ASVs with collision-free behaviors. In the first layer, an auction theory is utilized to achieve the attack-defense matching that efficiently assigns multiple defending ASVs to corresponding attacking ASVs in a distributed manner. In the second layer, an adaptive attack-defense guidance method is proposed, enabling each underactuated defending ASV to implement the appropriate guidance law aligned with the optimal interception point. In the last layer, a quadratic programming problem is formulated using speed-heading-constraint control barrier functions, and a neurodynamics optimization approach is employed to achieve real-time resolution of the optimal attack-defense guidance signal. The stability and safety analyses show that the system error is practically stochastic input-to-state stable, and the system is guaranteed to be safe. Experiment results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed neurodynamics-based attack-defense guidance method for domain protection.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=10436506,IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics,2024
Resilient Distributed Fixed-Time Tracking of Heterogeneous UAVs-UGVs Systems Against DoS Attacks,"The fixed-time cooperative control is investigated for heterogeneous multiagent systems (HMASs) containing multiple unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) and unmanned ground vehicles (UGVs) under Denial of Service (DoS) attacks and external perturbations. First, for the ease of collaborative tasks, an unified model is obtained in the XY plane by transforming the dynamical models of UAVs and UGVs. Then, a fuzzy switching observer is designed to achieve unavailable state estimation during the attack zone. In particular, in virtue of the character of DoS attacks, a novel fixed-time stability theory is set up. On this foundation, a distributed fixed-time secure tracking control strategy is raised by utilizing the adaptive approach to effectively defend against DoS attacks. Notably, distinct from the existing works on finite-time stability for HMASs, the present method exhibits some brilliant features, such as fast response, high accuracy, and attack resistance. Additionally, rational proofs have substantiated that the designed control scheme can not only ensure the boundedness of each closed-loop signal but also guarantee the synchronization error converges to a predefined small neighborhood near the origin in a fixed time. Ultimately, the validity of the proposed method is demonstrated by a representative simulation.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=10571363,"IEEE Transactions on Systems, Man, and Cybernetics: Systems",2024
Explosive Cyber Security Threats During COVID-19 Pandemic and a Novel Tree-Based Broad Learning System to Overcome,"The rapid spread of the COVID-19 has not only affected personal health and economy, but also revolutionized people’s lifestyles. As more people turn to work and socialize online, the development of unmanned technologies based on the Internet of Vehicles (IoV), such as unmanned delivery, unmanned vehicles, unmanned transportation, etc., will become an inevitable trend. However, all kinds of intelligent terminals for unmanned equipment require a large amount of data interaction with devices such as cloud servers, mobile terminals, and roadside terminals, which poses cyber security risks. Furthermore, the outbreak of COVID-19 has prompted people to put forward higher demands for the security of network communications. Unfortunately, the current intrusion detection methods based on machine learning still have weaknesses such as low accuracy and low efficiency when faced with unbalanced data distribution. To solve the above problems, we propose a novel Tree-based BLS (TBLS) intrusion detection method according to the idea of ensemble learning and decision tree (CART and J48). The performance of TBLS was tested on the NSL-KDD dataset and the UNSW-NB15 dataset respectively, which contain a variety of malicious traffic types for attacks on the IoV. The results show that our proposed method can achieve higher accuracy rate and lower false alarm rate, compared with the existing 16 solutions.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9743968,IEEE Transactions on Intelligent Transportation Systems,2024
BeTAIL: Behavior Transformer Adversarial Imitation Learning From Human Racing Gameplay,"Autonomous racing poses a significant challenge for control, requiring planning minimum-time trajectories under uncertain dynamics and controlling vehicles at their handling limits. Current methods requiring hand-designed physical models or reward functions specific to each car or track. In contrast, imitation learning uses only expert demonstrations to learn a control policy. Imitated policies must model complex environment dynamics and human decision-making. Sequence modeling is highly effective in capturing intricate patterns of motion sequences but struggles to adapt to new environments or distribution shifts that are common in real-world robotics tasks. In contrast, Adversarial Imitation Learning (AIL) can mitigate this effect, but struggles with sample inefficiency and handling complex motion patterns. Thus, we propose BeTAIL: Behavior Transformer Adversarial Imitation Learning, which combines a Behavior Transformer (BeT) policy from human demonstrations with online AIL. BeTAIL adds an AIL residual policy to the BeT policy to model the sequential decision-making process of human experts and correct for out-of-distribution states or shifts in environment dynamics. We test BeTAIL on three challenges with expert-level demonstrations of real human gameplay in the high-fidelity racing game Gran Turismo Sport. Our proposed BeTAIL reduces environment interactions and improves racing performance and stability, even when the BeT is pretrained on different tracks than downstream learning.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=10564200,IEEE Robotics and Automation Letters,2024
A Regret-Informed Evolutionary Approach for Generating Adversarial Scenarios for Black-Box Off-Road Autonomy Systems,"Developing autonomous vehicles (AVs) that operate in diverse and demanding environments is a difficult challenge. Two fundamental tools that can accelerate this process are testing an AV in diverse simulated environments and identifying core system weaknesses. While most efforts focus on improving these tools for on-road AVs, this letter focuses on an analogous set of tools for off-road AVs. A method called Black-Box Adversarially Compounding Regret Through Evolution (BACRE) is proposed for identifying adversarial scenarios using an evolutionary algorithm guided by a novel regret-based metric for general navigation tasks. A black-box approach is often preferable when system complexity can be diverse, like with off-road AVs, and when whole-system testing is required. A custom simulation platform is also provided to assist with the automated testing of AVs in diverse, unstructured environments. Numerical experiments demonstrate that BACRE's evolutionary process gradually increases scenario complexity to degrade vehicle performance (an effective and explainable process that comparable methods cannot achieve). Consequently, BACRE can streamline AV development by finding weaknesses at any development stage.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85190169452&origin=inward,IEEE Robotics and Automation Letters,2024
Detection and Mitigation of Position Spoofing Attacks on Cooperative UAV Swarm Formations,"Detecting spoofing attacks on the positions of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) within a swarm is challenging. Traditional methods relying solely on individually reported positions and pairwise distance measurements are ineffective in identifying the misbehavior of malicious UAVs. This paper presents a novel systematic structure designed to detect and mitigate spoofing attacks in UAV swarms. We formulate the problem of detecting malicious UAVs as a localization feasibility problem, leveraging the reported positions and distance measurements. To address this problem, we develop a semidefinite relaxation (SDR) approach, which reformulates the non-convex localization problem into a convex and tractable semidefinite program (SDP). Additionally, we propose two innovative algorithms that leverage the proximity of neighboring UAVs to identify malicious UAVs effectively. Simulations demonstrate the superior performance of our proposed approaches compared to existing benchmarks. Our methods exhibit robustness across various swarm networks, showcasing their effectiveness in detecting and mitigating spoofing attacks. Specifically, the detection success rate is improved by up to 65%, 55%, and 51% against distributed, collusion, and mixed attacks, respectively, compared to the benchmarks.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=10352334,IEEE Transactions on Information Forensics and Security,2024
Deep Attention Recognition for Attack Identification in 5G UAV Scenarios: Novel Architecture and End-to-End Evaluation,"Despite the robust security features inherent in the 5G framework, attackers will still discover ways to disrupt 5G unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) operations and decrease UAV control communication performance in Air-to-Ground (A2G) links. Operating under the assumption that the 5G UAV communications infrastructure will never be entirely secure, we propose Deep Attention Recognition (DAtR) as a solution to identify attacks based on a small deep network embedded in authenticated UAVs. Our proposed solution uses two observable parameters: the Signal to Interference plus Noise Ratio (SINR) and the Received Signal Strength Indicator (RSSI) to recognize attacks under Line-of-Sight (LoS), Non-Line-of-Sight (NLoS), and a probabilistic combination of the two conditions. Several attackers are located in random positions in the tested scenarios, while their power varies between simulations. Moreover, terrestrial users are included in the network to impose additional complexity on attack detection. Additionally to the application and deep network architecture, our work innovates by mixing both observable parameters inside DAtR and adding two new pre-processing and post-processing techniques embedded in the deep network results to improve accuracy. We compare several performance parameters in our proposed Deep Network. For example, the impact of Long Short-Term-Memory (LSTM) and Attention layers in terms of their overall accuracy, the window size effect, and test the accuracy when only partial data is available in the training process. Finally, we benchmark our deep network with six widely used classifiers regarding classification accuracy. The eXtreme Gradient Boosting (XGB) outperforms all other algorithms in the deep network, for instance, the three top scoring algorithms: Random Forest (RF), CatBoost (CAT), and XGB obtain mean accuracy of 83.24 %, 85.60 %, and 86.33% in LoS conditions, respectively. When compared to XGB, our algorithm improves accuracy by more than 4% in the LoS condition (90.80% with Method 2) and by around 3% in the short-distance NLoS condition (83.07% with Method 1).",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=10210056,IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology,2024
Finite-Time Security Control of Networked Unmanned Marine Vehicle Systems Subject to DoS Attack,"The finite-time dynamic positioning controller design problem of the unmanned marine vehicle (UMV) system under switching DoS attacks is investigated. Firstly, an adaptive memory-based event-triggering communication mechanism (METCM) is designed to save networked resources in maritime environment. Second, the signals released by the communication mechanism are quantized to further reduce the bandwidth of the communication network. In addition, since adversary may have multiple attack strategies, thus a hierarchical semi-Markov process (HS-MP) is presented to capture the phenomenon of switching DoS attacks, which makes the attack model more realistic. Further, sufficient conditions are proposed for the finite-time boundedness (FTB) of the UMV system and some linear matrix inequalities are solved to determine the finite-time bounded controller gain. Finally, the effectiveness of the proposed control method is demonstrated by a simulation example.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85182364174&origin=inward,IEEE Transactions on Intelligent Vehicles,2024
"Privacy-Aware Remote Identification for Unmanned Aerial Vehicles: Current Solutions, Potential Threats, and Future Directions","The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) recently introduced a new standard, namely, remote identification, to improve accountability for unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) operations. This rule requires UAV operators to broadcast messages revealing sensitive data, such as identity and location on the wireless channel. However, this leads to security and privacy concerns among UAV operators. Unauthorized parties may easily discover the location and identity of a UAV flying in a specific area and launch attacks on it such as using wireless jamming or tracking its activity. This review investigates and systematizes the main weaknesses affecting the Remote ID capability required of modern UAVs, and the approaches through which attackers can exploit these weaknesses to disrupt safety and accountability. Moreover, this article analyzes current solutions that mitigate privacy issues associated with Remote ID. Finally, we identify multiple challenges that require to be addressed by both industry and academia, and we propose future research directions to improve the security and privacy of UAVs.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85161566703&origin=inward,IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics,2024
Trajectory Inference of Unknown Linear Systems Based on Partial States Measurements,"Proliferation of cheaper autonomous system prototypes has magnified the threat space for attacks across the manufacturing, transport, and smart living sectors. An accurate trajectory inference algorithm is required for monitoring and early detection of autonomous misbehavior and to take relevant countermeasures. This article presents a trajectory inference algorithm based on a acrlong CLOE approach using partial states measurements. The approach is based on a physics informed state parameteterization that combines the main advantages of state estimation and identification algorithms. Noise attenuation and parameter estimates convergence are obtained if the output trajectories fulfill a persistent excitation condition. Known and unknown desired reference/destination cases are considered. The stability and convergence of the proposed approach are assessed via Lyapunov stability theory under the fulfillment of a persistent excitation condition. Simulation studies are carried out to verify the effectiveness of the proposed approach.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=10384817,"IEEE Transactions on Systems, Man, and Cybernetics: Systems",2024
An Efficient Self-Evolution Method of Autonomous Driving for Any Given Algorithm,"Autonomous vehicles are expected to achieve self-evolution in the real-world environment to gradually cover more complex and changing scenarios. Reinforcement learning focuses on how agents act in the environment to maximize the cumulative reward, with a great potential to achieve self-evolution ability. However, most of reinforcement learning algorithms suffer from a low sample efficiency, which greatly limits their application in autonomous driving. This paper presents an efficient self-evolution method for any given algorithm based on the combination of Soft Actor Critic (SAC) and Behavioral Cloning(BC). First, the states of the sample trajectory in the replay buffer are separated and input into the given algorithm (algorithm with fundamental performance) to get the output label of actions such that the SAC algorithm can be guided using BC to achieve fast iteration in the direction of optimization with existing basic performance. Then, the value iteration algorithm is combined to achieve the proportion allocation of mixed gradient feedback, in order to trade off exploitation and exploration. In addition, the proposed methodology is evaluated in simulation environment taking automated speed control as an example. Experiment results show that compared with SAC algorithm, the proposed method can realize more than three times of convergence efficiency improvement, while without destroying the exploration enhancement advantage of reinforcement learning algorithm, that is, the performance is improved by 20% compared with the given algorithm (Intelligent Driver Model, IDM). The proposed method can easily extended to improve any given model no matter it is model-based or learning-based algorithm.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=10239250,IEEE Transactions on Intelligent Transportation Systems,2024
Post-Quantum Authentication Against Cyber-Physical Attacks in V2X-Based Autonomous Vehicle Platoon,"In this paper, we propose a platoon access authentication system for initial access process in autonomous vehicle platoons (AVPs) in which post-quantum encryption and signal processing techniques are employed to protect against both active and passive cyber-physical attacks. To avoid passive quantum cyber attacks, a quasi-cyclic moderate-density parity-check code is used to encode and decode AVP messages. Moreover, an independent component analysis-based signal separation technique is employed to eliminate the effect of high-power active cyber attacks on AVP messages. To measure the reliability of the system, we derive an analytical expression for the system failure probability, taking into account the influence of both the cyber and physical planes. The simulations show that the proposed system is effective against attacks and can help reduce system failures caused by intentional and unintentional adverse cyber-physical effects. The proposed system offers a potential solution to the challenge of protecting initial access while maintaining ultra-reliable low-latency communications between AVPs and the infrastructure.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85181568620&origin=inward,IEEE Transactions on Intelligent Transportation Systems,2024
An Anti-Congestion Interaction Mechanism Based Leaderless Formation Control for Unmanned Surface Vehicles With Communication Interruptions,"More credible communication reliability and more economical resource consumption are technological trends for multiple leaderless unmanned surface vehicles (USVs), while the realistic marine environment severely threatens system communication quality. Within this context, this paper investigates the leaderless formation control problem of USVs experiencing inter-vehicle communication interruptions. Concretely, by establishing the formation error system, the concerned leaderless formation control problem is tactfully transformed into the formation error consensus problem. Taking communication interruptions into account, a distributed controller is developed to achieve formation error consensus with intermittent inter-vehicle communications. Simultaneously, to endow the leaderless formation system with high economy, a novel intermittent dynamic interleaved periodic event-triggered mechanism (IDIPETM) is integrated into the controller synthesis, leaving the USVs to interact with each other only at preset periodic event-detecting instants. By assigning exclusive interleave bias to each vehicle, the proposed IDIPETM naturally eliminates the possibility that multiple USVs simultaneously broadcast information, thereby eradicating the communication congestion phenomenon inherent in the existing periodic event-triggered mechanisms. Finally, the theoretical analysis and simulation results are provided to evaluate the effectiveness and superiority of the proposed control scheme.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85198240416&origin=inward,IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology,2024

Resilient Consensus for Discrete-Time Multiagent Systems With a Dynamic Leader and Time Delay: Theory and Experiment,"The ever-present cyber-attacks have posed a significant challenge to consensus of multiagent systems (MASs), due to their capability of compromising agents. These threats underscore the critical need to design control strategies that can endow MASs with resilience. In this article, we address resilient consensus problems for first- and second-order discrete-time MASs, considering the presence of malicious agents, a dynamic leader, and communication delay. First, a resilient controller is designed for first-order MASs, and sufficient conditions are derived based on existing robust graph concepts to achieve consensus with ultimately bounded error. Next, since the derived error bound grows factorially with the system scale, a novel graph structure and a modified controller are proposed to limit the growth to a linear rate. Building upon the obtained results, an estimator-based control framework is introduced to solve resilient consensus problems for second-order MASs. Finally, comparative simulations and practical experiments based on unmanned ground vehicles and unmanned-aerial-vehicles are conducted to validate the effectiveness and practicability of the proposed control methods.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85205000956&origin=inward,IEEE Transactions on Cybernetics,2024
Event-Based Distributed Secure Control of Unmanned Surface Vehicles With DoS Attacks,"This study investigates the distributed secure control problem of multiple unmanned surface vehicles (USVs) in the presence of wave-induced disturbances and unified abrupt and incipient rudder angle faults in physical layer, and aperiodic Denial-of-Service (DoS) attacks in cyber layer. Multi-USVs with rudder angle fault and DoS attack modeling are first established. Then, the decentralized unknown input observer (UIO)-based fault estimation and distributed secure control approach is developed in a co-designed framework for multi-USVs with cyber–physical threats. Advantages of the proposed secure scheme are: 1) actuator faults, DoS attacks, and event-triggering strategies with varying action instants, durations, and locations are synchronously addressed and 2) the criteria of exponential consensus are derived by virtue of attack frequency and average dwelling time technique without prior knowledge of unknown wave-induced perturbation bounds and elimination of Zeno behavior in an event-based mechanism.

Improving Physical Layer Security for multi-UAV Systems Against Hybrid Wireless Attacks,"Multiple unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) systems are increasingly used in civilian and military applications. However, due to the open and broadcast nature of wireless communications, the control and non-payload communication (CNPC) between UAVs and ground control stations (GCSs) is vulnerable to physical (PHY) and medium access control (MAC) layer wireless attacks, such as eavesdropping, jamming, and spoofing. In this paper, we investigate the secure remote control (RC) issue in multi-UAV systems from a physical layer security (PLS) perspective. We propose a secure RC mechanism based on John Boyd's OODA loop and introduce cooperative jamming (CJ) from UAVs to safeguard control data from GCS. To quantify the uncertainty of wireless attacks from aerial and terrestrial potential attackers, we first introduce the Nakagami-m fading model and a mixed line-of-sight (LoS) / non-line-of-sight (NLoS) probability model to characterize hostile air-to-ground (A2G) channels. We then derive the conditions for successful attacks including passive/active eavesdropping, jamming and spoofing, and formulate the risks of each attack and the overall CJ efficiency based on secrecy outage probability (SOP). To optimize the trade-off between risk costs and CJ power consumption for various situations, we propose three levels of control schemes (centralized, partially centralized, and distributed) applicable at GCS or UAVs, and design three decision-making methods with differing complexities. Through simulations, we evaluate the performance of the proposed mechanism under a general scenario that provides diverse physical conditions, threat levels, and security requirements.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=10329444,IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology,2024
Fuzzy Finite-Time ${H_\infty }$ Hybrid-Triggered Dynamic Positioning Control of Nonlinear Unmanned Marine Vehicles Under Cyber-Attacks,"This article studies the fuzzy finite-time ${H_\infty }$ hybrid-triggered dynamic positioning (DP) control design issue of the nonlinear unmanned marine vehicles against cyber-attacks and ocean disturbances. The motion dynamics are firstly represented by the Takagi-Sugeno (T-S) fuzzy DP models. Secondly, for the purpose of obtaining the surge position, sway position, yaw angle and velocity of unmanned marine vehicles, a fuzzy state observer is proposed to estimate them. Then, a hybrid-triggered mechanism described by a Bernoulli variable is designed to save the communication resources. To overcome the impacts of cyber-attacks and ocean disturbances, a fuzzy ${H_\infty }$ hybrid-triggered DP output feedback controller based on finite-time theory is developed. The stability criterions of the considered systems are formulated through establishing finite-time Lyapunov-Krasovskii functional.

Collision-Free Formation Control for Heterogeneous Multiagent Systems Under DoS Attacks,"A safe time-varying formation (TVF) control framework is proposed in this article for heterogeneous multiagent systems under the constraints of denial of service (DoS) attacks, noncooperative dynamic obstacles, and input saturation. The framework integrates both the cyber-layer and physical-layer components to address the challenges posed by these adverse conditions. In the cyber-layer, a distributed resilient observer is provided based on a control Lyapunov function (CLF)-quadratic program (QP). This observer estimates a reference exosystem, effectively decoupling heterogeneous dynamics from unsafe networks and optimizing the system resilience against DoS attacks. At the physical-layer, for the first time, a collision-free TVF controller is presented based on the CLF-exponential control barrier function-QP. The controller guarantees high-order heterogeneous agents’ operation safety under noncooperative obstacles and input saturation. The effectiveness and advantages of the proposed algorithms are verified through the comparative simulations and experiments conducted on a physical system comprising unmanned aerial vehicles and unmanned ground vehicles.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=10609734,IEEE Transactions on Cybernetics,2024
Performance Analysis of Blockchain-Enabled Security and Privacy Algorithms in Connected and Autonomous Vehicles: A Comprehensive Review,"Strategic investment(s) in vehicle automation technologies led to the rapid development of technology that revolutionised transport services and reduced fatalities on a scale never seen before. Technological advancements and their integration in Connected Autonomous Vehicles (CAVs) increased uptake and adoption and pushed firmly for the development of highly supportive legal and regulatory and testing environments. However, systemic threats to the security and privacy of technologies and lack of data transparency have created a dynamic threat landscape within which the establishment and verification of security and privacy requirements proved to be an arduous task. In CAVs security and privacy issues can affect the resilience of these systems and hinder the safety of the passengers. Existing research efforts have been placed to investigate the security issues in CAVs and propose solutions across the whole spectrum of cyber resilience. This paper examines the state-of-the-art in security and privacy solutions for CAVs. It investigates their integration challenges, drawbacks and efficiencies when coupled with distributed technologies such as Blockchain.

A Distributed Multi-Vehicle Coordination Algorithm for Navigation in Tight Environments,"This work presents a distributed method for multi-vehicle coordination based on nonlinear model predictive control (NMPC) and dual decomposition. Our approach allows the vehicles to coordinate in tight spaces (e.g., busy highway lanes or parking lots) by using a polytopic description of each vehicle's shape and formulating collision avoidance as a dual optimization problem. Our method accommodates heterogeneous teams of vehicles (i.e., vehicles with different polytopic shapes and dynamic models can be part of the same team). Our method allows the vehicles to share their intentions in a distributed fashion without relying on a central coordinator and efficiently provides collision-free trajectories for the vehicles. In addition, our method decouples the individual-vehicles' trajectory optimization from their collision-avoidance objectives enhancing the scalability of the method and allowing one to exploit parallel hardware architectures. All these features are particularly important for vehicular applications, where the systems operate at high-frequency rates in dynamic environments. To validate our method, we apply it in a vehicular application, that is, the autonomous lane-merging of a team of connected vehicles to form a platoon. We compare our design with the centralized NMPC design to show the computational benefits of the proposed distributed algorithm.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=10549815,IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology,2024
Pose and Shape Estimation of Humans in Vehicles,"As autonomous driving technologies advance, occupants are expected to be free from driving, diversifying interaction scenarios with vehicles. Despite the growing importance of in-vehicle occupant monitoring systems, most existing systems focus on the face or head tracking of occupants, and only a few studies have attempted to detect their poses. In this paper, we present the first in-vehicle environment-specialized framework for the joint estimation of 3D human pose and shape from a single image. To this end, we introduce a new dataset called Human In VEhicles (HIVE), which contains a large collection of synthesized humans with different shapes and poses in vehicle images. HIVE provides RGB and NIR in-vehicle image pairs with ground-truth 2D and 3D pose and shape annotations, respectively. In addition, to exploit the different characteristics of humans in vehicles and unconstrained environments, we present a new pose prior penalizing poses that deviate from in-vehicle poses. The pose prior is derived using a variational autoencoder trained with in-vehicle human pose data. By using the proposed HIVE dataset and pose prior along with an elaborately designed two-stage training procedure, our method exhibits significantly improved pose and shape estimation performance compared with state-of-the-art methods for real-world test images captured in vehicles under different conditions.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=10229964,IEEE Transactions on Intelligent Transportation Systems,2024
A Secure Personalized Federated Learning Algorithm for Autonomous Driving,"Federated learning (FL) is a promising technology for autonomous driving, enabling connected and autonomous vehicles (CAVs) to collaborate in decision-making and environmental perception while preserving privacy. However, traditional FL algorithms face challenges related to imbalanced data distribution, fluctuating channel conditions, and potential security risks associated with malicious attacks on local models. This paper proposes a fair and secure FL algorithm that not only addresses the challenges arising from imbalanced data distribution and fluctuating channel conditions, but defends against malicious attacks. Specifically, we first propose a personalized local training round allocation algorithm to balance energy costs and accelerate model convergence. Next, in order to further guarantee security, we embed an attack module based on Gini impurity. Extensive simulations demonstrate that the proposed algorithm achieves energy fairness, reduces global iteration time, and exhibits resistance against malicious attacks.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85208535784&origin=inward,IEEE Transactions on Intelligent Transportation Systems,2024
Cloth-Changing Person Re-Identification With Invariant Feature Parsing for UAVs Applications,"Recently, deep learning-based intelligent vehicle control systems have played an important role in real-time road conditions assessment applications. It relies primarily on unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) for specific target retrieval, especially Cloth-Changing Person Re-identification (CC-ReID) technology, to provide support for road observations and environmental monitoring. Existing CC-ReID methods mainly focus on the invariant features of the front and rear views that are independent of clothing; among them, global color enhancement is a commonly used strategy. However, this method usually reduces the chromatism between the target foreground and background, which can easily lead to the loss of features unrelated to clothing and reduce the model's performance. To solve this problem, this article proposes a data augmentation framework with Local Invariant Feature Transformation and Clothing Adversarial Parsing (LIFTCAP) for CC-ReID. The proposed framework is equipped with a Local Invariant Feature Transition (LIFT) module and a Clothes Adversarial Parsing (CAP) module. The former aims to extract invariant features for the same person with different clothes using the local transition manners. CAP is devoted to finding adversarial associations and parsing contour differences between clothing styles. Subsequently, a feature correlation strategy is alternately implemented between the two modules to complete the optimization procedure. Extensive experiments were conducted on the public CC-ReID datasets (LTCC and PRCC), demonstrating the superiority of our proposed method over the latest methods. Furthermore, our method achieved competitive performance, particularly on a surveillance video dataset (CCVID). In addition, based on the LIFTCAP strategy, the proposed algorithm can achieve a time efficiency as low as O(n) for detecting specific targets when deployed on a UAV server (Feisi X200) for real-time road conditions assessment and monitoring applications.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=10497899,IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology,2024
PDLC-LIO: A Precise and Direct SLAM System Toward Large-Scale Environments With Loop Closures,"As a key technology of autonomous driving, the high-precision vehicle localization is the prerequisite for automatic steer. With the advantage of accuracy and robustness, the Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR) is widely employed in Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM), which has been utilized to provide reliable positioning information. Compared with the experimental vehicles in the restricted laboratory driving circumstances, autonomous vehicles are devoted to actual roads and contain complicated activities, where closed loops can be noticed. In general, the accumulated error may be accumulated with the increasing of maneuver scope of SLAM. A distinct drift phenomenon may thus be incurred in the completed point cloud map and threaten the accuracy of positioning results. Focusing on this deficiency, a tightly-coupled LiDAR inertial odometry, named PDLC-LIO, is developed in this paper towards large-scale environments with close loops. A direct point cloud registration approach without extracting features has been introduced into this framework. Strategies including the pre-integration on the Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU), the direct scan match in local-scale, and an efficient fusion loop closure detection method with conditional detection are included to guarantee the precision. Also, the factor graph optimization is considered, and measurements from LiDAR odometry, IMU and loop closures can thus be integrated into the back-end optimization. The proposed method has been verified on both the public datasets and the test cases collected by our own autonomous driving experiment platform. Accurate experimental results can be obtained. Such results show that the performance including accumulated errors and the drift phenomenon outperforms the state-of-the-art algorithms LeGO-LOAM/ LIO-SAM /FAST-LIO2, and the loop closure detection rate can be promoted up to 75%.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=10234608,IEEE Transactions on Intelligent Transportation Systems,2024
Robust Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning Method Based on Adversarial Domain Randomization for Real-World Dual-UAV Cooperation,"A control system of multiple unmanned aerial vehicles (multi-UAV) is generally very complex when they complete a task in a closely-cooperative manner, e.g. two UAVs cooperatively transport a package of goods. Multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) offers a promising solution for such a complex control. However, MARL heavily relies on trial-and-error explorations, facing a big challenge in gathering real-world training data. Simulation environments are commonly used to overcome this challenge, i.e., a control policy is trained in a simulation environment and then transferred into a real-world system. But there often exists a gap between simulation and reality and thus a successful transfer is not guaranteed easily. The domain randomization method provides a workable way to bridge this gap. Nevertheless, the traditional one used in a policy training often suffers from slow convergence and results in an unstable decision policy. To address these issues, this article proposes an adversarial domain randomization method. It utilizes an adversarial generator as a “nature player” to generate a more reasonable training environment so that the trained decision policy can deal with complex situations. Additionally, we improve the prioritized experience replay method by which we can sample those critical experiences, increasing the convergence speed of a training without decreasing the performance of the trained policy. We apply our method to a real-world task of dual-UAV cooperative transportation, and experiments illustrate its effectiveness compared to traditional ones.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=10225713,IEEE Transactions on Intelligent Vehicles,2024
An Anti-Spoofing Model Based on MVM and MCCM for a Loosely-Coupled GNSS/INS /LiDAR Kalman Filter,"GNSS/INS/LiDAR-based Multi-Sensor Fusion (MSF) systems facilitate the efficient integration of multiple navigation sensors to deliver stable and dependable positioning outcomes in Autonomous Vehicles (AVs). Generally, AVs are bound to operate in diverse scenarios. However, state-of-the-art spoofing attack algorithms can identify vulnerable periods of MSF systems and execute aggressive GNSS spoofing in certain specific scenarios with high success rates. The present study proposes a security defense algorithm for MSF systems based on an enhanced Kalman filter, incorporating the Measurement Variance Monitoring (MVM) and Minimum Constraint of Covariance Matrix (MCCM) model. MVM effectively constrains the impact of GNSS signals with large positioning errors, thereby mitigating the adverse effects caused by spoofing attacks. MCCM fully leverages LiDAR information between two consecutive GNSS signals to enhance the credibility of LiDAR measurements, thus improving the positioning correction capability. Furthermore, considering the diverse application environments of AVs, this paper primarily focuses on sensor uncertainty variation and validates different models in varying scenarios. Ultimately, real-world data demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed anti-spoofing model, which can significantly mitigate positioning errors caused by GNSS spoofing attacks without affecting navigation accuracy.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=10325609,IEEE Transactions on Intelligent Vehicles,2024
Dynamic Event-Triggered Model Predictive Control Under Channel Fading and Denial-of-Service Attacks,"This article presents a model predictive control (MPC) design based on dynamic event-triggered mechanism (DETM). In the sensor-to-controller channel, the networks are unreliable in the sense that the transmitted signals may suffer from channel fading which is characterized by a stochastic process. In the controller-to-actuator network, the Denial-of-Service (DoS) attacks are taken into consideration whose dynamic behavior is described by a binary Markov process. Moreover, the external disturbance is considered. First, a DETM is employed to schedule the data transmission with the aim of reducing the communication burden. Then, an  $H_{\infty }$ -type cost function is applied in the MPC design to improve the system’s robustness against disturbance. Different from the conventional MPC, the novelty of developed MPC is that it can improve the communication efficiency and enhance the robustness against these network-induced issues simultaneously. At last, the validity and superiority of the proposed technique are demonstrated by simulation studies. Note to Practitioners—With the development of information technologies, the practical control systems are highly integrated with wireless networks. In such case, the network-induced issues are very important. For example, in the platooning control of automated vehicles, the conventional time-triggered control scheme leads to unnecessary waste of communication resource and thus heavy communication burden. Especially, this issue becomes particularly important when the number of vehicles increases. This article was motivated by this and it suggests a new control design based on DETM. Moreover, in control systems, it is necessary to utilize the state measurement to compute control signals. However, when the measured state information is affected by DoS attacks and channel fading, the system performance and even stability will be seriously damaged. Furthermore, the external disturbances widely exist in practical engineering. Considering the influence of these issues, this paper studies the design of MPC. The obtained results aim to provide a helpful reference for the controller design under various network-induced issues, involving bandwidth constraints, DoS attacks and channel fading. It is expected that the proposed MPC design can be applied to more practical engineering systems.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=10292789,IEEE Transactions on Automation Science and Engineering,2024
In-Vehicle Network Intrusion Detection System Using CAN Frame-Aware Features,"With the advancement of connected and automated vehicles (CAVs), drivers now have access to convenient features such as lane-keeping, cruise control, and more. The electronic control units (ECUs) equipped within vehicles communicate with each other through the controller area network (CAN). However, since the CAN does not possess any security mechanisms, it becomes a target for adversaries to attack. In light of this, a significant amount of research regarding intrusion detection systems (IDSs) has focused on detecting such maliciously injected CAN packets. Nevertheless, most existing machine learning-based IDSs neither calculate the exact time intervals of the CAN packets nor utilize the counter information. Precise timing intervals are a crucial feature for detecting spoofing, fuzzing, and replay attacks, and counter information is also a significant feature that can detect fuzzing and replay attacks. Therefore, in this paper, we propose a methodology for extracting two detection features that are aware of CAN frame characteristics: the interframe space (IFS) between two consecutive CAN packets, and the counter information of a CAN data payload (i.e., data field). Using these features, we introduce decision tree-based IDS. We evaluate the proposed features with popular decision tree-based models such as random forest and extreme gradient boosting (XGBoost). The results show that our proposed IDS can detect maliciously injected CAN packets with an F1 score of 99.54% in binary classification and 97.99% in multi-class classification, which are higher scores than what existing machine/deep learning-based IDSs achieve. Additionally, we measure the detection time of our proposed IDS in both online and offline testing environments.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85174843725&origin=inward,IEEE Transactions on Intelligent Transportation Systems,2024
Beidou Receiver Based on Anti-Jamming Antenna Arrays with Self-Calibration for Precise Relative Positioning,"Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) may be subjected to unintentional radio frequency interference (RFI) or hostile jamming attack which will lead to fail to track global navigation satellite system (GNSS) signals. Therefore, the simultaneous realization of anti-jamming and high-precision carrier phase difference positioning becomes a dilemmatic problem. In this paper, a distortionless phase digital beamforming (DBF) algorithm with self-calibration antenna arrays is proposed, which enables to obtain distortionless carrier phase while suppressing jamming. Additionally, architecture of high precision Beidou receiver based on anti-jamming antenna arrays is proposed. Finally, the performance of the algorithm is evaluated, including antenna calibration accuracy, carrier phase distortionless accuracy, and carrier phase measurement accuracy without jamming. Meanwhile, the maximal jamming to signal ratio (JSR) and real time kinematic (RTK) positioning accuracy under wideband jamming are also investigated. The experimental results based on the real-life Beidou signals show that the proposed method has an excellent performance for precise relative positioning under jamming when compared with other anti-jamming methods.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85213450605&origin=inward,Journal of Systems Engineering and Electronics,2024
Sustainability Opportunities and Ethical Challenges of AI-Enabled Connected Autonomous Vehicles Routing in Urban Areas,"The advent of Connected Autonomous Vehicles (CAVs) paves the way to a new era of urban traffic control and management, driven by Artificial Intelligence (AI)-enabled strategies. This advancement promises significant improvements in infrastructure use optimization, traffic delay reduction, and overall sustainability. The autonomous driving capabilities of CAVs, coupled with the communication technology, allow vehicles to play an active role in urban traffic control: they can follow tailored instructions and can act as highly accurate moving sensors for traffic authorities. However, such improved capabilities come at the cost of unprecedented vulnerabilities to cyber exploitation, and with the concrete potential to increase social and economic disparities. As an extension of TIV-DHW (Distributed/Decentralized Hybrid Workshop) on ERS (Ethics, Responsibility, and Sustainability), this letter explores how the AI-enabled routing methodology can enhance urban transportation sustainability while also discussing its ethical implications and challenges.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=10368346,IEEE Transactions on Intelligent Vehicles,2024
Multichain-Assisted Lightweight Security for Code Mutated False Data Injection Attacks in Connected Autonomous Vehicles,"Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITSs) comprise a whole infrastructure of conventional vehicles, Connected Autonomous Vehicles (CAVs), roadside units, and communication equipment. As a result, a variety of smart sensors, cloud, and edge services are used. Due to the Vehicle-to-Everything (V2X) communication involved in these, the infrastructure becomes prone to security attacks. The most common of these is False Data Injection Attack (FDIA), which causes serious consequences upon driving decisions of a CAV. Blockchain is an ascending technology to provide proficient data security solutions; however, its implementation in securing CAV data is restricted due to its parallel reliance on cloud services. Furthermore, a standalone blockchain is prone to transaction verification delay and reduced transaction throughput, which is intolerable in the fast-paced CAV communication. This paper presents a novel framework enabling multichain, an open-source blockchain platform. Components of the proposed framework include multiple blockchains running on CAVs. The hashing algorithm operates on their Basic Safety Messages (BSMs), inputted to it as blockchain transactions. Our findings reveal that this multichain framework eliminates reliance on cloud services by devising a fully decentralized security solution against stealthy FDIAs that jeopardize a CAV’s lane-changing. It provides an economy-building point for the CAV-metaverse by incentivizing the participating CAVs. Further, it manages transactions by employing multiple parallel blockchains for enhanced throughput. CAVs perform these security checks in as low as a few milliseconds compared to the existing centralized and computationally intensive frameworks.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=10502280,IEEE Transactions on Intelligent Transportation Systems,2024
Joint Path Planning for Multiple Automated Vehicles in Lane-Free Traffic With Vehicle Nudging,"This article presents a joint trajectory optimization algorithm for a number of connected and automated vehicles in a lane-free traffic environment with vehicle nudging. A double double-integrator model is utilized for the longitudinal and lateral movements of each vehicle. The objective function consists of several sub-objectives that reflect corresponding, partially competing driving aspects and concerns, including passenger comfort, low fuel consumption, vehicle advancing at desired speed, collision avoidance, suppressing of infeasible maneuvers. Fixed and state-dependent control input bounds account for various technical limitations as well as for road boundary respect. The solution of the formulated joint Optimal Control Problem (OCP) is computed by use of a very efficient Feasible Direction Algorithm, which exploits the structure of the state equations to map the OCP into a reduced Nonlinear Programming Problem. To demonstrate the efficiency of the proposed approach, challenging scenarios are examined on a lane-free straight motorway stretch. The results of the centralized (joint) OCP are compared with a previously investigated decentralized approach where OCPs are employed separately for individual vehicles.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=10660660,IEEE Transactions on Intelligent Transportation Systems,2024
REDFormer: Radar Enlightens the Darkness of Camera Perception With Transformers,"Enhancing the accuracy and reliability of perception systems in automated vehicles is critical, especially under varying driving conditions. Unfortunately, the challenges of adverse weather and low-visibility conditions can seriously degrade camera performance, introducing significant risks to vehicle safety. To address these concerns, in this study, we introduce a novel transformer-based 3D object detection model named ‘REDFormer’. By exploiting bird's-eye-view camera-radar fusion, the REDFormer offers a more practical and financially viable solution for tackling low-visibility conditions. We validate our model using the comprehensive nuScenes dataset, incorporating camera images, multi-radar point clouds, weather information, and time-of-day data. In comparative analyses, our model surpasses state-of-the-art benchmarks in both classification and detection accuracy. An in-depth ablation study further elucidates the individual contributions of each model component in overcoming the challenges posed by weather and lighting conditions. Experimental results specifically highlight the model's significant performance improvements, demonstrating a 31.31% increase in accuracy under rainy conditions and a 46.99% enhancement during nighttime scenarios, affirming REDFormer's potential as a robust and cost-effective solution for automated vehicles.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=10310160,IEEE Transactions on Intelligent Vehicles,2024
Graph Matching-Based Spatiotemporal Calibration of Roadside Sensors in Cooperative Vehicle-Infrastructure Systems,"Sensors, such as cameras, millimeter-wave radar, and LiDAR, are widely deployed in cooperative vehicle-infrastructure systems. The demand for calibration of initial installation, damage replacements, and unstable installation has risen dramatically. Traditional methods require on-site operation and road closure; thus, repeated calibration can severely affect traffic conditions and expose operational personnel to potential safety threats. As more and more autonomous vehicles (AVs) flood the roads, this paper proposes an automatic calibration framework of roadside sensors by leveraging the high-precision positioning and perception data of AVs. First, we design a graph-based target-matching algorithm using an AV’s surrounding traffic perception data to identify the AV of interest from a dataset of multiple target trajectories recorded by roadside sensors. A line search algorithm is then designed to adjust the clock delay between sensors and establish the temporal correspondence, where a Gaussian process is applied to estimate the vehicle state in continuous time. Finally, we develop a least squares optimization model to complete the final calibration with the AV positioning data. The influence of measurement noise and missed detections on the proposed calibration framework are analyzed in simulated scenarios based on a Next Generation SIMulation (NGSIM) dataset, and the practicability is validated based on real-world data collected at Donghai Bridge, Hangzhou Bay Bridge, and DAIR-V2X dataset. It is shown that the proposed target matching algorithm can identify an AV trajectory from roadside sensor data with 20%-90% higher accuracy than baseline models, and the framework can accurately estimate the spatial and temporal parameters even with poor data quality. The mean least squares error of the trajectory alignment reaches centimeter-level accuracy.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=10475128,IEEE Transactions on Intelligent Transportation Systems,2024
Autonomous Manipulation of an Underwater Vehicle-Manipulator System by a Composite Control Scheme With Disturbance Estimation,"This article addresses an autonomous manipulation problem for an underwater vehicle-manipulator system (UVMS) operating in a free-floating way while subjecting to unknown continuous disturbance. More specifically, a composite control scheme composed of disturbance observer (DOB), predictor model network (PM-Net), and nonlinear model predictive control (NMPC), is devised to improve the control performance of UVMS (i.e., unicycle-like UVMS actuated only in the surge, heave, and yaw for vehicle body) in the case of disturbance, model mismatch, and input saturation. A RBF-DOB is formulated by combining a DOB and a Radial Basis Function (RBF) neural network to estimate disturbance at the current step. Then, the PM-Network, composed of a disturbance predictor network and state predictor network, is developed based on long short-term memory (LSTM) network that predicts UVMS state sequences considering model mismatch and disturbance. The NMPC is deployed as a feedback control law to endow the input saturation of the UVMS and produce optimal control action. Compared with conventional DOB control methods using feed-forward compensation of disturbance, the primary merit of the proposed approach is that the disturbance estimated by RBF-DOB is utilized in the PM-Net to predict future UVMS state sequences, which are exploited on the NMPC’s receding optimization. Finally, realistic simulation and relevant experiment are conducted to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method. Note to Practitioners—The motivation behind this article is the autonomous manipulation of an underwater vehicle-manipulator system subjected to unknown disturbance. However, it is not always feasible or straightforward to obtain the external disturbance and unmodeled dynamics for designing robust controllers. On the one hand, how to manipulate the disturbance into the designed controller to generate optimal control action rather than by using feed-forward compensation. On the other hand, the control input saturation often occurs in the UVMS control, especially under the disturbance rejection conditions, where it should be considered in the controller design. Currently, the predominant methods for UVMS control lack a control scheme that provides a complete and credible control strategy that takes the aforementioned issues into consideration. Motivated by the above analysis, this study provides a composite control scheme to deal with the dynamic uncertainties, unknown disturbance, and input saturation. The results of realistic simulation and relevant experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method. Hopefully, our control method can provide valuable theoretical and technical guidance to practicing marine engineers for controller design.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=10016284,IEEE Transactions on Automation Science and Engineering,2024
Optimizing Fault-Tolerant Quality-Guaranteed Sensor Deployments for UAV Localization in Critical Areas via Computational Geometry,"The increasing spreading of small commercial unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs, also known as drones) presents serious threats for critical areas, such as airports, power plants, and governmental and military facilities. In fact, such UAVs can easily disturb or jam radio communications, collide with other flying objects, perform espionage activity, and carry offensive payloads, e.g., weapons or explosives. A central problem when designing surveillance solutions for the localization of unauthorized UAVs in critical areas is to decide how many triangulating sensors to use, and where to deploy them to optimize both coverage and cost effectiveness. In this article, we compute deployments of triangulating sensors for UAV localization, optimizing a given blend of metrics, namely: coverage under multiple sensing quality levels, cost-effectiveness, and fault-tolerance. We focus on large, complex three-dimensional (3-D) regions, which exhibit obstacles (e.g., buildings), varying terrain elevation, different coverage priorities, and constraints on possible sensors placement. Our novel approach relies on computational geometry and statistical model checking and enables the effective use of off-the-shelf AI-based black-box optimizers. Moreover, our method allows us to compute a closed-form, analytical representation of the region uncovered by a sensor deployment, which provides the means for rigorous, formal certification of the quality of the latter. We show the practical feasibility of our approach by computing optimal sensor deployments for UAV localization in two large, complex 3-D critical regions, the Rome Leonardo Da Vinci International Airport (FCO) and the Vienna International Center (VIC), using NOMAD as our state-of-the-art underlying optimization engine. Results show that we can compute optimal sensor deployments within a few hours on a standard workstation and within minutes on a small parallel infrastructure.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85178026609&origin=inward,"IEEE Transactions on Systems, Man, and Cybernetics: Systems",2024
Low-Rank Sparse Generative Adversarial Unsupervised Domain Adaptation for Multitarget Traffic Scene Semantic Segmentation,"Semantic segmentation in diverse real-world traffic scenes is a challenging task for autonomous vehicles to have a reliable understanding of the outside environment. Although deep visual models show a remarkable performance on traffic scene segmentation, they need significant improvements when the source and target scene distributions are different. The weather and illumination differences between source and target datasets result in dramatic distribution shifts that degrade the target segmentation performance. This article develops an unsupervised domain adaptation (UDA) model to address complex domain shift problems where the dataset, weather, and illumination of source and target traffic scenes are different. We devise a sparse adversarial multitarget UDA approach to capture powerful domain-invariant features to segment traffic scenes in different conditions. First, a sparse representation of the source traffic scenes is captured via a new spectral low-rank dictionary learning technique in the latent space of a deep encoder–decoder segmentation architecture. The feature sparsity provides high generalization capacity for our deep feature extractor that enables us to compute complex visual patterns of source images. Then, the distribution of source sparse features is learned using a generative adversarial framework. Finally, the sparse representations of source and target scenes are aligned via a sparse domain-invariant feature extractor trained by min–max optimization. The aligned features serve as domain-invariant scene representations that can best describe both source and target scenes; hence providing deep domain adaptation for traffic scene semantic segmentation. Experiments on a real-world dataset indicate the superiority of the proposed model compared to the state-of-the-art methodologies.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85165925189&origin=inward,IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics,2024
Automated Microrobotic Manipulation Using Reconfigurable Magnetic Microswarms,"Untethered microrobots possess a promising perspective for micromanipulation applications. With specifically designed morphologies and structures, microrobots are able to perform controllable delivery of target objects. However, the manipulation process still lacks autonomy, to achieve which the mechanism of picking, transporting, and releasing behaviors needs further investigation. In this article, we propose to achieve automated microrobotic manipulation using magnetic microswarms with multimodal morphology. The microswarm is composed of around 11–21 million $\text{Fe}_{3}\mathrm{O}_{4}$ nanoparticles (1.0$\text{--}1.8\,\mu$L particle suspension). When exposed to different dynamic magnetic fields, the swarm could exhibit corresponding forms. We realize precise and controllable cargo picking and releasing by exploiting the fluid fields of different swarm forms. In order to quantitatively describe these behaviors, we design a finite-state machine. A super-twisting sliding-mode controller has been formulated for the motion control of swarms. The disturbances are compensated via a disturbance observer. To enable automated micromanipulation in obstructed scenarios, a path planner inspired by rapidly exploring random tree algorithm is designed for path planning when obstacles exist. We also propose an enhanced-genetic algorithm to optimally transport multiple objects to the target position. Experiments demonstrate that our method could effectively transport micro-objects with different sizes and shapes. The precise selectivity of the method is validated when multiple objects exist in the working environment. Finally, the long-distance delivery ability and adaptivity to various friction situations of our strategy are demonstrated. This work explores a concise, untethered, and automated micromanipulation strategy, provides a new automatic tool for micromanipulation tasks, and extends the application potential of swarm microrobotics.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=10598230,IEEE Transactions on Robotics,2024
A Privacy-Preserving-Based Distributed Collaborative Scheme for Connected Autonomous Vehicles at Multi-Lane Signal-Free Intersections,"This paper proposes a privacy-preserving distributed collaboration (PPDC) scheme for connected autonomous vehicles (CAVs) to cross signal-free intersections based on the cloud, while securing the private data of the vehicles. Firstly, this paper converts the cooperation problem into a multi-objective problem that aims to improve the efficiency of traffic and fuel economy. Secondly, to prevent the privacy of the transmitted data of vehicles from being inferred by untrusted cloud servers or external attackers, an affine masking-based privacy strategy is designed. Specifically, the vehicle first uploads the encrypted state data to the cloud with the affine masking method. Then the cloud returns the control input by solving the newly constructed optimization problem, which is different but equivalent to the original problem. Then the vehicle calculates the real control input by the inverse affine masking mechanism. Simulation examples show that the proposed PPDC scheme can guarantee collision avoidance and the privacy protection of transmitted data of CAVs, improve traffic efficiency as well as fuel economy, and avoid extensive computation burden.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=10401008,IEEE Transactions on Intelligent Transportation Systems,2024
Robust Indoor Positioning of Automated Guided Vehicles in Internet of Things Networks With Deep Convolution Neural Network Considering Adversarial Attacks,"The effectiveness of positioning techniques that utilize the receiver signal strength (RSS) is highly dependent on the instability of the received signal strength indicator (RSSI). Up to now, there is no strategy that effectively lowers the influence of such instability on the accuracy of positioning. Moreover, recent studies showed that indoor positioning techniques are vulnerable to noise in RSSI data and cyber-attacks, which make them more expensive. In this study, a new Internet of Things (IoT) paradigm is proposed for the indoor positioning of automated guided vehicles (AGVs) using a deep convolution neural network (CNN). The proposed method handles signal processing by converting the RSSI signal into an image. In which, the 1-D RSSI signal is converted into 2-D image data in order to generate the new features based on continuous wavelet transform (CWT), and then the proposed deep CNN is implemented for the indoor positioning system. The test results show that the proposed model can outperform other state-of-the-art positioning techniques with small position errors. Furthermore, the robustness of the proposed model is validated against various adversarial attacks. In addition, the proposed method can have a lower impact on RSSI change compared with other methods.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85183964741&origin=inward,IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology,2024
Privacy-Preserving Data-Enabled Predictive Leading Cruise Control in Mixed Traffic,"Data-driven predictive control of connected and automated vehicles (CAVs) has received increasing attention as it can achieve safe and optimal control without relying on explicit dynamical models. However, employing the data-driven strategy involves the collection and sharing of privacy-sensitive vehicle information, which is vulnerable to privacy leakage and might further lead to malicious activities. In this paper, we develop a privacy-preserving data-enabled predictive control scheme for CAVs in a mixed traffic environment, where human-driven vehicles (HDVs) and CAVs coexist. We tackle external eavesdroppers and honest-but-curious central unit eavesdroppers who wiretap the communication channel of the mixed traffic system and intend to infer the CAVs’ state and input information. An affine masking-based privacy protection method is designed to conceal the true state and input signals, and an extended form of the data-enabled predictive leading cruise control under different data matrix structures is derived to achieve privacy-preserving optimal control for CAVs. Numerical simulations demonstrate that the proposed scheme can protect the privacy of CAVs against attackers without affecting control performance or incurring heavy computations.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=10324502,IEEE Transactions on Intelligent Transportation Systems,2024
AERO: Automotive Ethernet Real-Time Observer for Anomaly Detection in In-Vehicle Networks,"Automotive Ethernet enables high-bandwidth in-vehicle networking, facilitating the transmission of sensor data among electronic control units. However, the increasing connectivity and potential vulnerability inheritance in connected and autonomous vehicles expose them to security risks. To address this challenge, an intrusion detection system (IDS) capable of analyzing automotive Ethernet traffic and detecting anomalies is essential. In thisarticle, we propose automotive Ethernet real-time observer (AERO), an unsupervised network IDS designed to protect in-vehicle networks. AERO consists of three components: a feature extractor that constructs three multimodal features, a neural network for processing the extracted features, and an online anomaly detector that calculates outlier scores in real time. We evaluate the performance of AERO using the TOW-IDS automotive Ethernet intrusion dataset. The experimental results demonstrate that AERO achieves high detection performance across five different attack types and is highly applicable to automotive-grade devices for real-time anomaly detection.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=10309857,IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics,2024
Evolutionary Decision-Making and Planning for Autonomous Driving: A Hybrid Augmented Intelligence Framework,"Recently, thanks to the introduction of human feedback, Chat Generative Pre-trained Transformer (ChatGPT) has achieved remarkable success in the language processing field. Analogically, human drivers are expected to have great potential in improving the performance of autonomous driving under real-world traffic. Therefore, this study proposes a novel framework for evolutionary decision-making and planning by developing a hybrid augmented intelligence (HAI) method to introduce human feedback into the learning process. In the framework, a decision-making scheme based on interactive reinforcement learning (Int-RL) is first developed. Specifically, a human driver evaluates the learning level of the ego vehicle in real-time and intervenes to assist the learning of the vehicle with a conditional sampling mechanism, which encourages the vehicle to pursue human preferences and punishes the bad experience of conflicts with the human. Then, the longitudinal and lateral motion planning tasks are performed utilizing model predictive control (MPC), respectively. The multiple constraints from the vehicle’s physical limitation and driving task requirements are elaborated. Finally, a safety guarantee mechanism is proposed to ensure the safety of the HAI system. Specifically, a safe driving envelope is established, and a safe exploration/exploitation logic based on the trial-and-error on the desired decision is designed. Simulation with a high-fidelity vehicle model is conducted, and results show the proposed framework can realize an efficient, reliable, and safe evolution to pursue higher traffic efficiency of the ego vehicle in both multi-lane and congested ramp scenarios.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=10400976,IEEE Transactions on Intelligent Transportation Systems,2024

BioKA-ASVN: Biometric-Based Key Agreement Scheme for Air Smart Vehicular Networks Using Blockchain Service,"Air Smart Vehicular Networks (ASVNs) have become increasingly essentials in military and commercial industries in recent years, where drones are deployed to interact among each other via wireless medium in airspace due to their agility and versatility. ASVNs can form a closed loop from data perception to final execution by integrating communication devices, computation tools, and control modules. However, the used unencrypted and publicly available navigational signals like Global Positioning System (GPS) and communication over (public) insecure Internet connections, including wireless networks and WiFi, make ASVNs vulnerable to security breaches. Attackers can easily gain access to a drone's configuration and take control remotely, by launching various attacks such as GPS spoofing, false sensor data injection, maldrone malware injection, eavesdropping, man-in-the-middle, Denial-of-Service (DoS), replay, forgery, and Skyjack attacks. This paper proposes a robust and efficient multi-factor biometric-based security mechanism using blockchain as a service to address the security and privacy breaches in ASVNs. A comparative study demonstrates that the proposed scheme provides superior security and better functionality features with low communication and computation overheads as compared to the existing analogous schemes. The feasibility of the proposed scheme in real-life drone applications is also demonstrated through a real-time testbed and blockchain simulation.

Secured and Cooperative Publish/Subscribe Scheme in Autonomous Vehicular Networks,"In order to save computing power yet enhance safety, there is a strong intention for autonomous vehicles (AVs) in future to drive collaboratively by sharing sensory data and computing results among neighbors. However, the intense collaborative computing and data transmissions among unknown others will inevitably introduce severe security concerns. Aiming at addressing security concerns in future AVs, in this paper, we develop SPAD, a secured framework to forbid free-riders and promote trustworthy data dissemination in collaborative autonomous driving. Specifically, we first introduce a publish/subscribe framework for inter-vehicle data transmissions. To defend against free-riding attacks, we formulate the interactions between publisher AVs and subscriber AVs as a vehicular publish/subscribe game, and incentivize AVs to deliver high-quality data by analyzing the Stackelberg equilibrium of the game. We also design a reputation evaluation mechanism in the game to identify malicious AVs in disseminating fake information. Furthermore, for lack of sufficient knowledge on parameters of the network model and the user cost model in dynamic game scenarios, a reinforcement learning based algorithm with hotbooting is developed to obtain the optimal strategies of subscriber AVs and publisher AVs with free-rider prevention. Extensive simulations are conducted, and the results validate that our SPAD can effectively prevent free-riders and enhance the dependability of disseminated contents, compared with conventional schemes.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=10494725,IEEE Transactions on Intelligent Transportation Systems,2024
AI-Based Sensor Attack Detection and Classification for Autonomous Vehicles in 6G-V2X Environment,"Autonomous Vehicles (AVs) mainly rely on sensor data and are anticipated to transform the transportation sector. The abnormal sensor readings generated by malicious cyberattacks or defective vehicle sensors can result in deadly crashes. This paper proposes a Sensor Attack Detection and Classification (SADC) framework in a 6G-V2X environment to examine the cybersecurity concern for AVs against sensor attacks. The SADC framework employs GPS and LiDAR sensor attack detectors and the Pattern-based Attack Classification (PAC) algorithm. It combats new-age cyberattacks and provides an accurate sensor attack detection and classification mechanism in AVs. A protocol-based attack detection scheme in SADC is developed to identify the abnormal source sensor based on the detector's results. The PAC algorithm classifies malicious sensors by analyzing different strategies: instant, constant, bias, and gradual drift. The results show that the SADC framework has a 0.98% higher accuracy than the existing counterparts in detecting attacks and classifying them efficiently..",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85178002682&origin=inward,IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology,2024
A Multilevel Electronic Control Unit Re-Encryption Scheme for Autonomous Vehicles,"Electronic control units (ECUs) connected by a controller area network (CAN) are used to perform various functions in modern vehicles. In the latest autonomous vehicles, redundant ECUs and a backup bus (different from CAN) are always equipped to prevent a single point of failure or network attack. However, due to the lack of protection measures of CAN bus, attackers can remotely intrude into the vehicle. Many schemes have proposed to use encryption to solve the security problem of CAN bus. Considering the current ECU storage space is limited, it is impossible to store all ECUs’ keys. When a single point of failure or network attack against an ECU occurs, it is necessary for the backup ECU to process the messages related to the failed ECU. How to ensure that the backup ECU can decrypt the encrypted messages and at the same time securely isolates the backbone network from the backup network is an urgent issue to be solved. In order to solve the problem of forwarding and processing such messages under encryption conditions, we propose an efficient re-encryption scheme based on proxy re-encryption. The scheme is also suitable for cross-bus communication without backup networks. Burrows-Abadi-Needham (BAN) logic, random oracle model and Automated Validation of Internet Security Protocols and Applications (AVISPA) tool are utilized to prove that the scheme is secure. The scheme is simulated based on the MIRACL cryptography library on the computer and Raspberry Pi. The simulation results demonstrate that the proposed scheme is secure compared with the existing scheme.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=10247102,IEEE Transactions on Intelligent Transportation Systems,2024
VADGAN: An Unsupervised GAN Framework for Enhanced Anomaly Detection in Connected and Autonomous Vehicles,"The utilization of Connected and Autonomous Vehicles (CAVs) is on the rise, driven by their ability to provide vehicular services such as enhancing vehicle safety, aiding in intelligent decision-making, and ensuring continuous operation. CAVs achieve their objectives by employing wireless Vehicle-to-Everything (V2X) communication within Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS) to establish connections with vehicles within the same network and roadside units. However, it has been observed that certain vehicles violate network constraints by transmitting erroneous messages, resulting in abnormal behaviour. Consequently, there is a growing need for a system that can verify the accuracy of information broadcast by each vehicle regarding its vehicle coordinates (along with relevant data depending on the application) at designated frequencies and under authorized pseudo-identities. Addressing the limitations faced by prior generative AI model applications, such as Variational Autoencoders (VAEs), this paper presents an unsupervised anomaly detection framework using Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) optimized for CAVs. Our framework tested across LSTM, RNN, and GRU architectures shows superior performance with LSTM, focusing on vehicle dynamics–position, speed, acceleration, and heading–to effectively identify 11 specific attack types, marking a significant advancement in anomaly detection for CAVs.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=10499724,IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology,2024
A UAV-Assisted Authentication Protocol for Internet of Vehicles,"As a component of the Intelligent Transportation System (ITS), Internet of Vehicles (IoV) is becoming increasingly important in the management and construction of urban transportation as it can provide users with a range of applications related to traffic accident warnings, entertainment information, collaborative driving and real-time road information through communication devices on vehicles. However, with the increasing variety of services in the IoV, the growing demand for user traffic and the advances in Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) technology, UAV is introduced into the IoV as a solution, which can relieve the pressure on the communication infrastructure in the network, provide emergency communication services and improve the performance of network services. Due to the openness of IoV and the high-speed movement of vehicles, authentication and privacy issues are among the most pressing issues in IoV. Therefore, the paper proposes a secure and effective authentication protocol for UAV-assisted IoV. The protocol utilises elliptic curve cryptography to assure the security of the authentication. The protocol undergoes proof of security, Burrows-Abadi-Needham (BAN) logic analysis and informal security analysis to ensure secure and mutual authentication, and have a good resistance to known attacks. Furthermore, performance analysis and comparison are conducted to evaluate the efficiency of our protocol. The results indicate that our protocol has superior advantages in overhead.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=10457572,IEEE Transactions on Intelligent Transportation Systems,2024
A Secure Self-Certified Broadcast Authentication Protocol for Intelligent Transportation Systems in UAV-Assisted Mobile Edge Computing Environments,"Unmanned Aerial Vehicle(UAV)-assisted mobile edge computing(MEC) ensures continuous MEC services by promptly restoring overloaded or disabled MEC infrastructure. Equipped with sufficient computing resources, UAVs deploy to areas needing MEC, such as task offloading and entertainment services. However, in areas with paralyzed edge nodes, vehicle users are unable to verify the legitimacy of UAVs as they cannot access to the trusted authority(TA). Furthermore, the integrity of UAV-assisted MEC environments can be compromised by malicious attackers, as all network participants rely on wireless communication for their interactions. Many authentication schemes have been proposed for UAV environments. However, these schemes encounter a problem of having to communicate through TA for authentication with vehicle users, which makes them difficult to apply to UAV-assisted MEC environments. Therefore, we propose a new broadcast authentication protocol, which can recover MEC services using MEC-equipped UAVs. The proposed protocol can provide UAVs and vehicle users with high reliability via a self-certified public-key cryptosystem, which can verify the legitimacy of the communication partner without the TA. Moreover, we guarantee the user privacy and preserve sensitive information using biohash technology. We verify the security robustness of the proposed protocol using various simulation tool, informal, and formal analyses. We also estimate the practical deployment of the proposed protocol using “Network Simulator-3”. Moreover, we estimate the computation and communication overheads and compare with other existing protocols. The results show that the proposed protocol is feasible and provides users with convenient and seamless intelligent transportation services in UAV-assisted MEC environments.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85207630323&origin=inward,IEEE Transactions on Intelligent Transportation Systems,2024
Multi-Process Federated Learning With Stacking for Securing 6G-V2X Network Slicing at Cross-Borders,"Being part of the 6G ecosystem vision, Connected and Automated Vehicles (CAVs) will enjoy sophisticated tailored services offering road safety and entertainment for users. As one of the 6G cornerstones, Network Slicing (NS) allows the creation of various customized 6G-V2X (Vehicle-to-Everything) use cases on the same physical infrastructure. However, 6G-NS advances can open up breaches to cyber-attacks aiming to break 6G-V2X Network slices to inflict maximum damage on CAVs and their users. Crossing borders, where CAVs leave their V2X-NS (V2X Network Slice) in the Home Mobile Network Operator (H-MNO) toward a similar V2X-NS in the Visited MNO (V-MNO), is an attractive opportunity to exploit by attackers. Detecting and mitigating attacks, in this case, becomes a priority, confronted by NS requirements and MNOs not ready to share their private data. To this end, this paper proposes a 3GPP-compliant privacy preservation collaborative learning scheme for 6G-NS security, focusing on V2X-NS cross-border areas. Our scheme leverages multi-process Federated Learning (FL) architecture to build efficient V2X-NS security-related models while preserving 6G V2X-NS isolation. In addition, it uses differential privacy-enabled stacking to build up attack detection knowledge at the V2X-NSs and MNOs levels while ensuring privacy preservation. We conducted an experimental study on the 5G-NIDD dataset, which is one of the most realistic publicly available 5G datasets. Our results demonstrate that multi-process FL with stacking can deliver high accuracy while ensuring isolation between 6G-V2X-NSs and privacy preservation between H-MNO and V-MNO.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=10457521,IEEE Transactions on Intelligent Transportation Systems,2024
Simultaneous Scheduling of Processing Machines and Automated Guided Vehicles via a Multi-View Modeling-Based Hybrid Algorithm,"The flexible job-shop co-scheduling problem (FJCSP) for processing machines and automated guided vehicles (AGVs) in a flexible manufacturing system (FMS) has attracted more attention with the aim of improving production efficiency. In FMS, AGVs in charge of transporting jobs realize the flexible linkage of operations between different processing machines. The added interdependence between transporting and processing tasks brings more difficulties than the traditional flexible job-shop scheduling problem (FJSP). In this paper, the mathematical model of FJCSP is formulated to minimize the makespan. Considering the feature similarity of FJCSP with FJSP and AGV-routing problem in different cases, a multi-view modeling-based hybrid algorithm consisting of an estimation of distribution algorithm (EDA) and an ant colony optimization (ACO) is proposed. In EDA, a probability model abstracts the information in superior solutions about the operation sequencing and the rule selection for scheduling machines and AGVs. In ACO, a job-path pheromone model and an AGV-path pheromone model are designed to jointly select the job-machine-AGV combination with shorter processing time and transportation time. In the proposed hybrid algorithm, EDA and ACO generate solutions independently and achieve cooperation by sharing elites. An adaptive parameter is designed to regulate the use of the two methods to adapt to the varying demands of multi-view modeling in different cases and search stages. Furthermore, a local search with a three-layer operator based on the critical path method is proposed to balance exploration and exploitation in solution space. Finally, computational experiments involving a case study verified the advantage of the multi-view modeling-based hybrid algorithm in comparison with the state-of-the-art approaches. Note to Practitioners—This paper was motivated by the optimization problem of scheduling machines and automated guided vehicles (AGVs) in flexible manufacturing system (FMS). In FMS with AGVs, the transportation stages for jobs by AGVs significantly impact the overall production efficiency of the FMS and cannot be overlooked. This paper suggested a hybrid evolutionary algorithm using an estimation of distribution algorithm (EDA), an ant colony optimization (ACO) and a local search algorithm based on the critical path method. In the proposed hybrid algorithm, an adaptive parameter is introduced to regulate the utilization of EDA and ACO in generating a new population. This paper presents a mathematical characterization of the scheduling problem and subsequently outlines the step-by-step design of the hybrid algorithm. Computational experiments, including a case study, demonstrate that the hybrid algorithm exhibits adaptability to various instances and outperforms state-of-the-art approaches.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=10215051,IEEE Transactions on Automation Science and Engineering,2024
Time Series Anomaly Detection in Vehicle Sensors Using Self-Attention Mechanisms,"Connected autonomous vehicles (CAVs) offer significant enhancements in coordinated traffic and safety through real-time vehicle-to-vehicle or vehicle-to-infrastructure communications, establishing them as a potent tool for augmenting driving tasks. However, the extensive information-sharing framework inherent in CAVs amplifies the risk associated with sensor anomalies, posing challenges to the reliability and security of the system. Responding to this timely research challenge, this study proposes a novel anomaly detection method, namely Dual-channel Self-attention-based Convolutional Neural Network (DSA-CNN) for multivariate time series data. Through the introduction of the Dual-channel Self-attention Mechanism, DSA-CNN can progressively and autonomously extract spatiotemporal features from multivariate time series data. The proposed method was tested under a variety of common threatening sensor anomaly patterns of CAVs summarised in the literature, and evaluated under multiple different performance metrics. The results demonstrate its advantages in detecting minor anomalies and enhancing sensitivity, outperforming previously reported methods in the literature. Across all experimental scenarios, an average sensitivity improvement of 2.53% was observed, complemented by an average F1 score increase of 1.47%. In CAV settings, maintaining high sensitivity to ensure fewer undetected anomalies, alongside the ability to detect small anomalies, can be more important for the robustness and safety measures of CAV systems.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85209365254&origin=inward,IEEE Transactions on Intelligent Transportation Systems,2024
Secure and Safe Control of Connected and Automated Vehicles Against False Data Injection Attacks,"This paper studies the secure and safe control problem of connected and automated vehicles (CAVs) with false data injection (FDI) attacks. A secure and safe controller with a novel surrounding vehicles’ state estimator and an attack detector is proposed. The state estimation for surrounding vehicles is collectively processed by combining the deep neural network-based predictions with model-based estimations. Additionally, a weight in the loss function is proposed for more accurate predictions of vehicles that are closer to the ego vehicle. For attack detection, a novel scheme that utilizes control outcomes to train detection actions is proposed. Different from the objectives of existing detectors, the reward for the proposed detector is designed to encourage the CAV to fully utilize the observations. A reward setting and the decision preference of the ego vehicle are theoretically analyzed. The effectiveness of the proposed algorithm is validated in an open simulation environment.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=10471276,IEEE Transactions on Intelligent Transportation Systems,2024
Defense and Tolerance Technique Against Attacks and Faults on Leader-Following Multi-USVs,"This study explores the leader-following consensus tracking control issue of multiple unmanned surface vehicles (multi-USVs) in the presence of malicious connectivity-mixed attacks in the cyber layer, and concurrent output channel noises, sensor/actuator faults, and wave-induced disturbances in the physical layer. Sensor/actuator faults are initially modeled with unified incipient and abrupt features. Additionally, connectivity-mixed attacks are depicted using connectivity-paralyzed and connectivity-maintained topologies through nonoverlapping and switching iterations. The standardization and observer design in multi-USVs are incorporated to decouple the augmented dynamics and estimate unknown state, fault, and noise observations, and then a defense and fault-tolerant consensus tracking control approach is designed to accomplish the robustness to disturbances/noises, resilience to attacks, and tolerance to faults, simultaneously. The criteria for achieving leader-following exponential consensus tracking of multi-USVs with cyber-physical threats can be determined based on activation rate and attack frequency indicators. Comparative simulations outline the effectiveness and economy of the proposed defense and tolerance technique against sensor/actuator faults and cyber-attacks on multi-USVs.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85178034542&origin=inward,IEEE Transactions on Intelligent Transportation Systems,2024
A Location-Aware and Healing Attestation Scheme for Air-Supported Internet of Vehicles,"With the rapid technological advancement in the Internet of Things (IoT) and Internet of Vehicles (IoV), we witness exponential growth of Connected and Autonomous Vehicles (CAVs). However, these integrations of IoV with other technologies make the IoV network and its interaction between different network components highly complex. Therefore, ensuring the correct functioning of the firmware and software running on these next-generation vehicles becomes an essential requirement. A feasible method to address the aforementioned security issues is Remote Attestation (RA). However, the advancement in the attackers’ approaches and the increased complexity, large network size, and vehicle mobility allow the attacks to bypass these security solutions, making RA less effective. In this paper, we propose LHASIoV, an attestation and healing protocol for IoV. LHASIoV has many features such as competent-wise (treats different entities of the system differently), geographical location-aware (traces forensics of security breaches and eases healing compromised vehicles), gradual healing (via slicing the healing software) of compromised vehicles, and resistance to single-point-of-failure. We provide proof-of-concept implementation and formal operational and security analysis for LHASIoV. To show its practical feasibility and effectiveness, we provide performance analysis by implementing it on the Omnetpp simulator. The simulation results show that for an IoV system that has 100 vehicles moving with a speed range of 15–25 mph, LHASIoV needed only 5.27 seconds to complete the vehicle’s attestation. For this number of vehicles and compared to the existing protocols, LHASIoV reduced the communication and storage costs on average by 54.46% and 43.92%, respectively.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=10268662,IEEE Transactions on Intelligent Transportation Systems,2024
Stability and Safety Analysis of Connected and Automated Vehicle Platoon Considering Dynamic Communication Topology,"Connected and automated vehicles (CAVs) can communicate with other CAVs through vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) communication technology which can improve the stability and safety performance of the platoon. However, the V2V communication could be unreliable as some factors such as hardware damage, packet loss, and cyber-attack, may lead to communication delay or failure. Considering that the communication topology of the platoon can vary dynamically due to these factors, it may result in instability and collision risk on the platoon. To mitigate the impact of communication delay or failure, the study introduces a dynamic weights optimization-based CAV following model (DWOC). It adopts the multi-predecessor following (MPF) mode with which vehicles can obtain the dynamic information of three predecessors and the corresponding information weights can be adjusted adaptively. The study formulates the string stability conditions of the model and validates the stability and safety impact on the platoon through a series of numerical experiments. The results indicate that DWOC can effectively improve the stability and safety performance under different communication delays. The findings suggest that the CAV manufacturers should account for the possible changes of the communication topology of the platoon. The proposed DWOC can serve as a reference in designing the CAV controller to ensure stability and improve safety of the platoon in reality under different communication delays.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=10534902,IEEE Transactions on Intelligent Transportation Systems,2024

We focus on sparser point clouds, capturing scenarios from different perspectives: not just from vehicles on the road but also from mobile robots on sidewalks, which encounter significantly different environmental conditions and sensor configurations. We introduce Unsupervised Adversarial Domain Adaptation for 3D Object Detection (UADA3D). UADA3D does not depend on pre-trained source models or teacher-student architectures.

Dynamic Event-Triggered Distributed MPC for Heterogeneous UAVs–UGVs Against DoS Attacks,"In this study, we address the model predictive secure control challenge for a heterogeneous system composed of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) and unmanned ground vehicles (UGVs). Our objective is to cooperatively manage the UAVs–UGVs system to maintain equilibrium in the face of external disturbances and denial of service (DoS) attacks. We introduce a dynamic event-triggered distributed model predictive control (DET-Distributed MPC) approach. Initially, we integrate a robustness constraint into the distributed MPC framework, which incrementally tightens the states bounds, enhancing disturbance resilience. In addition, we devise a neighbor output sequence prediction mechanism to mitigate packet loss effects due to DoS attacks on communication channels. A dynamic event-triggered mechanism with adaptive triggering thresholds, responsive to DoS attack durations, is also developed. We establish sufficient conditions for the recursive feasibility of the MPC algorithm and the stability of the overall system. Comparative tests confirm the DET-Distributed MPC scheme's robustness and security efficacy.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=10591631,IEEE Transactions on Aerospace and Electronic Systems,2024

In this talk, I will briefly describe our past and current work to address the above research and development challenges, aiming to rally all stakeholders around the establishment of a national CAV certification center.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85193059023&origin=inward,IEEE Transactions on Intelligent Transportation Systems,2024
Hybrid Trajectory Planning for Connected and Autonomous Vehicle Considering Communication Spoofing Attacks,"In this study, we introduce a novel hybrid trajectory planning algorithm for autonomous driving, specifically designed to mitigate the risks posed by spoofing attacks on Connected and Autonomous Vehicles (CAVs). The research begins by assessing the safety implications of attacks and developing an adaptive safety model that is grounded in the fundamental assessment of state and decision data. This model incorporates the establishment of a posterior probability distribution for decision data, rooted in the pre-existing prior distribution but adjusted to account for the influence of spoofing attacks. The adjustment is achieved through Bayesian maximum posterior estimation, thereby refining the model to better adapt to potential threats. The adaptive safety model is then optimized dynamically, taking into consideration a set of indices—safety, comfort, and efficiency—that are critical to trajectory planning. In the subsequent phase, we introduce a composite trajectory planning algorithm that integrates a lateral trajectory selection sampling method with a longitudinal trajectory optimization approach. The adaptive safety model is seamlessly integrated into the trajectory planning process, influencing target position selection, the setting of constraints, and the formulation of the optimization objective function. The results demonstrate that the algorithm effectively limits the average standard deviation of lateral displacement to 0.5851 and achieves a significant increase in longitudinal speed growth rate, by up to 7.30%, surpassing the performance of benchmark algorithms. The proposed solution consistently delivers optimal safety and efficiency across various scenarios and under different parameter conditions.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=10474308,IEEE Transactions on Intelligent Transportation Systems,2024
Cyber-Physical Intrusion Detection System for Unmanned Aerial Vehicles,"The increasing reliance on unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) has escalated the associated cyber risks. While machine learning has enabled intrusion detection systems (IDSs), current IDSs do not incorporate cyber-physical UAV features, which limits their detection performance. Additionally, the lack of public UAV’s cyber and physical datasets to develop IDS hinders further research. Therefore, this paper proposes a novel IDS fusing UAV cyber and physical features to improve detection capabilities. First, we developed a testbed that includes UAV, controller, and data collection tools to execute cyber-attacks and gather cyber and physical data under normal and attack conditions. We made this dataset publicly available. The dataset covers a range of cyber-attacks including denial-of-service, replay, evil twin, and false data injection attacks. Then, machine learning-based IDSs fusing cyber and physical features were trained to detect cyber-attacks using support vector machines, feedforward neural networks, recurrent neural networks with long short-term memory cells, and convolutional neural networks. Extensive experiments were conducted on varying complexity and range of attack training data to explore whether (a) fusion of cyber and physical features enhances detection performance compared to cyber or physical features alone, (b) fusion enhances detection when IDS is trained on a single attack type and tested on unseen attacks of varying complexity, (c) fusion enhances performance when the range of attack training data increases and models are tested on unseen attacks. Answering these research questions provides insights into IDS capabilities using cyber, physical, and cyber-physical features under different conditions.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=10368002,IEEE Transactions on Intelligent Transportation Systems,2024
Stealthy Attack on Remote Control System With Local Controller and Its Countermeasures,"Cyber–physical systems (CPSs) driven by a local controller and a remote controller have been gaining significant research interest in recent years due to its application scenarios in practice, such as unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs). In this article, we consider the security issue in the remote control system with a local controller under stealthy attacks. Under this framework, one controller is designed locally based on the limited measurements collected by a local sensor, and the other controller is designed remotely and is transmitted to the actuator through a wireless communication channel, which may suffer malicious attacks due to its openness. To defend attacks on remote control signal, the K–L divergence-based detector or  $\chi ^{2}$  detector is often adopted. However, there may be attackers adopting stealthy attacks, which can bypass such detectors. Therefore, we analyze the existence of such attacks, and analytically characterize the worst-estimation performance degradation induced by the remote control signal attack. Further, we construct the optimal attack signal to achieve the upper bound on the estimation performance degradation. In addition, we also give countermeasures against such stealthy attacks. Simulations are provided to illustrate the proposed results.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85181564235&origin=inward,"IEEE Transactions on Systems, Man, and Cybernetics: Systems",2024
Autonomous Vehicle Platoons in Urban Road Networks: A Joint Distributed Reinforcement Learning and Model Predictive Control Approach,"In this paper, platoons of autonomous vehicles operating in urban road networks are considered. From a methodological point of view, the problem of interest consists of formally characterizing vehicle state trajectory tubes by means of routing decisions complying with traffic congestion criteria. To this end, a novel distributed control architecture is conceived by taking advantage of two methodologies: deep reinforcement learning and model predictive control. On one hand, the routing decisions are obtained by using a distributed reinforcement learning algorithm that exploits available traffic data at each road junction. On the other hand, a bank of model predictive controllers is in charge of computing the more adequate control action for each involved vehicle. Such tasks are here combined into a single framework: the deep reinforcement learning output (action) is translated into a set-point to be tracked by the model predictive controller; conversely, the current vehicle position, resulting from the application of the control move, is exploited by the deep reinforcement learning unit for improving its reliability. The main novelty of the proposed solution lies in its hybrid nature: on one hand it fully exploits deep reinforcement learning capabilities for decision-making purposes; on the other hand, time-varying hard constraints are always satisfied during the dynamical platoon evolution imposed by the computed routing decisions. To efficiently evaluate the performance of the proposed control architecture, a co-design procedure, involving the SUMO and MATLAB platforms, is implemented so that complex operating environments can be used, and the information coming from road maps (links, junctions, obstacles, semaphores, etc.) and vehicle state trajectories can be shared and exchanged. Finally by considering as operating scenario a real entire city block and a platoon of eleven vehicles described by double-integrator models, several simulations have been performed with the aim to put in light the main features of the proposed approach. Moreover, it is important to underline that in different operating scenarios the proposed reinforcement learning scheme is capable of significantly reducing traffic congestion phenomena when compared with well-reputed competitors.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=10400390,IEEE/CAA Journal of Automatica Sinica,2024
"A Mechanism to Localize, Detect, and Prevent Jamming in Connected and Autonomous Vehicles (CAVs)","One of the challenges in Connected and Autonomous Vehicles (CAVs) and Vehicular Ad Hoc Networks (VANETs) is jamming attacks. These attacks present safety concerns and may render the whole communication network ineffective. Designing an anti-jamming solution for CAVs and VANETs is non-trivial because every jamming scenario presents itself with unique characteristics. In this paper, we extend our previous work in Alam (2021) by proposing a scheme that localizes jamming vehicles, maps the jammed area, and prevents the jamming vehicles from sending and/or receiving beacons in the network. To achieve these objectives, we apply Centroid Localization (CL), Graham Scan Hull Algorithm (GSHA), and bloom filter data structure. The novelties of our work are three-fold. 1) We dynamically change the X, Y positions and radii of the jamming vehicles. 2) We implement multiple jamming attack scenarios with multiple jammers and varying number of vehicles. 3) We prevent the jamming vehicles from sending messages in the network. Simulation results show that on average, our model achieves an accuracy of 97.77%, a precision of 99.14%, a recall of 93.54%, and an F1 score of 96.03% for all the attack scenarios implemented.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85173049909&origin=inward,IEEE Transactions on Intelligent Transportation Systems,2024
An Autonomous Attack Decision-Making Method Based on Hierarchical Virtual Bayesian Reinforcement Learning,"In response to the challenges of estimating missile launch timing during close-range unmanned autonomous air combat in the future, this article proposes an autonomous attack decision-making method based on hierarchical virtual Bayesian reinforcement learning (HVBRL). First, a six-degree-of-freedom (6-DOF) high-fidelity aircraft dynamics model, along with missile dynamics and guidance rate models, is constructed. Second, the HVBRL algorithm is introduced, where the low-level algorithm outputs control parameters and the high-level algorithm generates control commands. Given that the number of missile hits on a target under specific conditions follows a binomial distribution, a simple prior knowledge can be introduced through its conjugate prior, the Beta distribution, to avoid prolonged exploration of ineffective areas. Moreover, carrying only a limited number of missiles and predicting the number of hits by multiple virtual missiles in specific states through a neural network circumvent the computational complexity issue associated with carrying an excessive number of missiles. Finally, this article presents the low-level training algorithm, the high-level training algorithm, and the high-level self-play training algorithm. Experimental results show that our method significantly reduces the simulation computational complexity. Compared with the Monte Carlo method carrying 1000 missiles, the simulation speed of the high-level training algorithm is increased by 32.75 times, and that of the high-level self-play algorithm is increased by 23 times. Moreover, the estimated missile hit probability with bias can effectively guide the timing of missile launches in close-range air combat, which has significant implications for intelligent autonomous air combat decision-making and operational analysis.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=10551427,IEEE Transactions on Aerospace and Electronic Systems,2024
Safe Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning for Wireless Applications Against Adversarial Communications,"Based on the network observations and learning parameters shared by the neighboring learning agents, multi-agent reinforcement learning (RL) has to enhance the performance over adversarial communications, in which spoofing attackers send fake learning messages to fool the learning agent and thus degrade the performance of wireless applications. In this paper, we propose a safe multi-agent RL algorithm for wireless applications against adversarial communications, in which each learning agent chooses the cooperative agents to share the learning information and authenticates the received learning messages before integrating them into the RL state formulation and the learning parameter update. The communication policy distribution for the cooperative agent selection is formulated based on the long-term discounted reward and the sharing reputation for each neighboring agent, which is updated based on the authentication results to indicate the probability as a spoofing attacker. Neural networks are designed to estimate the long-term discounted reward and the sharing reputation for the learning agent with sufficient computational resources in large-scale wireless networks to enhance the agent selection security. As a case study, our proposed algorithm is implemented in the unmanned aerial vehicle swarm anti-jamming video transmission against spoofing attackers that send fake received jamming power as well as Q-values and neural network weights in the anti-jamming transmission policy learning. Both simulation and experimental results are provided to verify the performance gain over the benchmark.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=10584557,IEEE Transactions on Information Forensics and Security,2024

VAuth: Robust Lightweight Mutual Authentication Protocol Preserving User’s Anonymity for VANET With FPGA Implementation,"Many applications that are developed for the Intelligent Transport System to ensure safety, efficiency and comfort, depend on communication among mobile vehicular nodes, road side units, fog servers, and trusted authority. Insecure wireless communication used for these applications is vulnerable to many attacks and it can endanger lives, create traffic congestion, and compromise privacy of the users.

In this paper, a novel, smart card-based, robust mutual authentication protocol namely VAuth for VANET is proposed. This scheme enables secure communication among entities while also preserving the anonymity and privacy of the users. To preserve unlinkability, VAuth uses pseudo-names, one-time secrets, and verification tokens.

A Bounded Rationality-Aware Car-Following Strategy for Alleviating Cut-In Events and Traffic Disturbances in Traffic Oscillations,"Neighboring human-driven vehicles (HDVs) frequently perform uncertain cut-in maneuvers, posing a threat to the safety and efficiency of autonomous vehicles (AVs), particularly in traffic oscillation scenarios characterized by AVs experiencing speed disturbances. In this paper, we propose an AV car-following strategy based on bounded rationality-aware reinforcement learning (BRARL) to handle cut-in maneuvers. The approach can handle scenarios involving simultaneous cut-in preclusion and cut-in yielding. Considering the limited rationality of human drivers during lane change, this strategy incorporates a bounded rationality-based game process to restrict discretionary cut-ins while safeguarding AV’s interests, including efficiency, safety, and comfort. The well-designed RL framework captures the exhibited randomness of both the cut-in and preceding HDVs, enabling the AV to effectively handle cut-in maneuvers and reduce speed disturbances. Simulated experiments demonstrate the high generalization capability of our strategy in reducing preceding speed disturbances (e.g., achieving a minimum reduction of 34.5% in traffic disturbances compared to two baselines), and preventing discretionary cut-in maneuvers.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=10599099,IEEE Transactions on Intelligent Transportation Systems,2024
Vehicle Motion Control Beyond and Within the Stability Limits for 4WD Electric Vehicles,"Autonomous vehicles with controllers capable of tracking path and speed in the largest possible operational domain, i.e., beyond and within the stability limits, provide significant safety potential. Dual-motor 4WD electric vehicles (EVs), a configuration already in mass production, can enable speed control when operating beyond the stability limits. This article presents a dynamic inversion-based path/speed tracking control law for this drivetrain topology, solving the nonlinear model inversion in a less computationally troublesome iterative way. The characteristics of vehicle input couplings are exploited to make this unified controller comprehensibly track the desired sideslip only when the sideslip dynamic is unstable. To allow the potentials of 4WD EVs to be fully unleashed, the prioritisation between path-tracking and yaw stabilisation, and the lower bounds of speed when the vehicle operates beyond the limits, are discussed.

The study uses data acquired by the airborne NASA unmanned aerial vehicle SAR (UAVSAR) L-band SAR instrument, imaging the Coal Oil Point seep field near Santa Barbara, California. Time series of images from three different days are analyzed, all containing both verified oil slicks and low-wind zones. We propose a method to derive high-confidence oil/open water maps by exploiting the differences in spatial and temporal evolution between the low-wind zones and oil slicks over time scales of ∼1–3.5 h. Our method uses the standard deviation of the backscatter intensity for ensembles of colocated SAR pixels and is sufficiently simple and generic to be applied to near-real-time and without special processing code. The derived maps are compared with images of the ocean surface obtained by cameras mounted on a boat surveying the seep field simultaneously with the SAR. The imagery is manually classified into confirmed oil, likely oil, and open water classes. Our results show ∼1–7 dB difference between the SAR-derived mean standard deviation values of the confirmed/likely oil classes compared with the open water class. The minimum number of scenes needed to distinguish between areas of high likelihood of open water and oil slick was determined to be 3–5 scenes, spanning 50–80 min, depending on the spatial extent and persistence of the low-wind zones in the imagery.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=10472046,IEEE Journal of Selected Topics in Applied Earth Observations and Remote Sensing,2024
CARLA-GeAR: A Dataset Generator for a Systematic Evaluation of Adversarial Robustness of Deep Learning Vision Models,"Adversarial examples represent a serious threat for deep neural networks in several application domains and a huge amount of work has been produced to investigate them and mitigate their effects. Nevertheless, no much work has been devoted to the generation of datasets specifically designed to evaluate the adversarial robustness of neural models. This paper presents CARLA-GeAR, a tool for the automatic generation of photo-realistic synthetic datasets related to driving scenarios that can be used for a systematic evaluation of the adversarial robustness of neural models against physical adversarial patches, as well as for comparing the performance of different adversarial defense/detection methods. The tool is built on the CARLA simulator, using its Python API, and allows the generation of datasets for several vision tasks in the context of autonomous driving. The adversarial patches included in the generated datasets are attached to billboards or the back of a truck and are crafted by using state-of-the-art white-box attack strategies to maximize the prediction error of the model under test. Finally, the paper presents an experimental study to evaluate the performance of some defense methods against such attacks, showing how the datasets generated with CARLA-GeAR might be used in future work as a benchmark for adversarial defense in the real world.

A Blockchain-Based Distributed and Intelligent Clustering-Enabled Authentication Protocol for UAV Swarms,"Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) are operated remotely without the presence of a unified system of identity authentication, and wireless communications in untrusted environments can cause the loss of valuable data carried by UAVs. Traditional UAV authentication mechanisms are centralized approaches, which suffer from a single point of failure problem and may incur high complexity computations. Therefore, it is crucial to establish a distributed authentication mechanism between the ground station controller (GSC) and a UAV. Moreover, in case of UAV swarms, the high mobility of the UAVs affects the stability of UAV communications, which leads to the degradation of the UAV authentication performance. Addressing these challenges, we design a blockchain-based distributed authentication mechanism, known as SwarmAuth, for UAV swarms, where the GSC and UAVs follow a mutual authentication approach using physical unclonable functions (PUFs), and the K-means clustering-based intelligent approach is used to dynamically create location-based clusters. The blockchain helps store UAVs’ authentication information in an immutable storage and the associated smart contracts provide a convenient access control model. The security analysis of SwarmAuth is carried out through both formal and informal proofs considering general attacks. Experimental evaluation shows that SwarmAuth can assure trustworthy communications and improve the network performance.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85173416664&origin=inward,IEEE Transactions on Mobile Computing,2024
Blockchain-Aided Secure Access Control for UAV Computing Networks,"Multiple unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) form a UAV cluster, which relies on wireless communication networks to facilitate information interaction among the UAVs. UAV clusters offer enhanced efficiency and fault tolerance, making reliable computing services possible. Compared to terrestrial networks, UAV computing network presents several desirable features, including mobility, availability, and flexibility, affording the potential for seamless global coverage. However, due to the inherent openness of wireless communication networks, UAV computing networks are susceptible to various security attacks. Existing access control mechanisms for UAV computing networks predominantly rely on base stations or central servers. This reliance elevates communication overhead for UAVs and exposes them to potential attacks from adversaries. Therefore, we propose a blockchain-aided distributed secure access control scheme specifically tailored for UAV computing networks, enabling UAVs to autonomously manage and determine identity, attributes, and access policies. To address the communication complexity and scalability concerns associated with blockchains, we integrate committee elections and clustering optimizations into the scheme. Security analysis and performance evaluation demonstrate that the proposed scheme can withstand common external and internal attacks in UAV clusters while ensuring lightweight energy consumption and scalability of UAV computing networks.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=10286081,IEEE Transactions on Network Science and Engineering,2024

Fully Distributed Secure State Estimation for Nonlinear Multi-Agent Systems Against DoS Attacks: An Edge-Pinning-Based Method,"This paper investigates the fully distributed secure state estimation problem of nonlinear multi-agent systems (MASs) against denial-of-service (DoS) attacks. The design of state observer depends on the relative measurement outputs between neighboring agents rather than the absolute ones of agents themselves. To cooperatively estimate system states with the influence of DoS attacks in a fully distributed scenario, an edge-pinning-based synchronous update strategy for coupling weights is proposed. The purpose of adopting edge pinning method is to adjust partial coupling weights between neighboring agents instead of all ones, which can effectively reduce estimation complexity and save computing resources, especially for large-scale MASs. Further, an edge-pinning-based asynchronous update strategy for coupling weights is designed to meet different actual demands. Then, the security state estimation schemes under synchronous and asynchronous update strategies are proposed without utilizing any global information, such as the Laplacian matrix of communication graph or its smallest nonzero eigenvalue, and so on. Finally, a simulation example is provided to verify the theoretical results. Note to Practitioners—This paper addresses the distributed secure state estimation problem for nonlinear MASs, which plays an important role in unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) formation, intelligent transport systems, smart grids, and so on. The absolute measurement outputs of agents themselves are usually unavailable in practical situations, so the relative measurement outputs between neighboring agents are used to design observers. Moreover, to overcome the difficulty that global information is unavailable in industrial applications with DoS attacks, the edge-pining-based synchronous and asynchronous update strategies for coupling weights are proposed in a fully distributed scenario.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=10186081,IEEE Transactions on Automation Science and Engineering,2024

Deep Reinforcement Learning-Based Resource Management for UAV-Assisted Mobile Edge Computing Against Jamming,"In mobile edge computing (MEC) systems, multiple unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) can be utilized as aerial servers to provide computing, communication, and storage services for edge users, called UAV-assisted MEC, which has emerged as a promising technology to improve both the computing and communication performances. Unlike existing works without considering jamming attacks, we investigate a multi-UAV-assisted-MEC scenario under multiple malicious jammers and then propose a resource management approach with the objective of minimizing both the system energy consumption and latency. Due to the time-varying nature of communication environments, we design a multi-agent deep reinforcement learning (MADRL)-based resource management approach to dynamically adjust the CPU frequency, communication bandwidth, and channel access selection of UAVs to enhance the system performance against jamming attacks. On this basis, in order to enhance the algorithm learning efficiency, we propose a multi-agent twin-delayed deep deterministic policy algorithm in combination with the prioritized experience replay mechanism (PER-MATD3) to effectively search for the joint resource management strategy under high-dimensional state and action spaces, where the time-varying channel state information and imperfect attack behavior information are also effectively trained to improve the learning capacity and convergence speed. Simulation and experimental results verify that the proposed approach can significantly decrease the overall system latency (i.e., computing and communication latency) and energy consumption compared to other benchmark algorithms under different real-world settings.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=10614297,IEEE Transactions on Mobile Computing,2024

It is shown that the resulting closed-loop CPSs can achieve ISS under the proposed control update protocol. One of the key advantages of our proposed control protocol is that the missing information can be compensated, and the CPSs thus, can tolerate more unfavorable DoS attacks. Moreover, an intuitive minimum interevent time is provided so as to exclude the Zeno execution of control signals. Finally, a simulation example on unmanned ground vehicle is presented to verify the effectiveness of the proposed control protocols.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=10528901,IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics,2024
FLASH-and-Prune: Federated Learning for Automated Selection of High-Band mmWave Sectors using Model Pruning,"Fast sector-steering in the mmWave band for vehicular mobility scenarios is a challenge because standard-defined exhaustive search over predefined antenna sectors cannot be assuredly completed within short contact times. This paper proposes machine learning to speed up sector selection using data from multiple non-RF sensors, such as LiDAR, GPS, and camera images in the mmWave radios with large codebooks. The contributions in this paper are threefold: First, we propose a multimodal deep learning architecture that fuses the inputs from these data sources and locally predicts the sectors for best alignment at a vehicle. Second, we propose FLASH-and-Prune, which combines the knowledge from multiple vehicles by aggregating the local model parameters and exploits model pruning to optimize the model parameter exchange overhead. Third, we present a pruning strategy that takes into account the distributed nature of federated learning to adaptively prune or retrieve model weights. We validate the proposed architecture on a real-world multimodal dataset collected from an autonomous car. We observe that FLASH-and-Prune incurs 29.25% and 35.89% less overhead in the uplink and downlink, respectively, compared to standard federated learning.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=10530437,IEEE Transactions on Mobile Computing,2024
"Design, Field Evaluation, and Traffic Analysis of a Competitive Autonomous Driving Model in a Congested Environment","Recently, numerous studies have investigated cooperative traffic systems using the communication among vehicle-to-everything (V2X). Unfortunately, when multiple autonomous vehicles are deployed while exposed to communication failure, there might be a conflict of ideal conditions between various autonomous vehicles leading to adversarial situation on the roads. In South Korea, virtual and real-world urban autonomous multi-vehicle races were held in March and November of 2021, respectively. During the competition, multiple vehicles were involved simultaneously, which required maneuvers such as overtaking low-speed vehicles, negotiating intersections, and obeying traffic laws.

We evaluate module-based systems such as navigation, perception, and planning in real and virtual environments. Additionally, an analysis of traffic is performed after collecting multiple vehicle position data over communication to gain additional insight into a multi-agent autonomous driving scenario. Finally, we propose a method for analyzing traffic in order to compare the spatial distribution of multiple autonomous vehicles. We study the similarity distribution between each team’s driving log data to determine the impact of competitive autonomous driving on the traffic environment.

Metacognitive Decision-Making Framework for Multi-UAV Target Search Without Communication,"This article presents a metacognitive decision-making (MDM) framework inspired by human-like metacognitive principles. The MDM framework is incorporated in unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) deployed for decentralized stochastic search without communication for detecting and confirming stationary targets (fixed/sudden pop-up) and dynamic targets. The UAVs are equipped with multiple sensors (varying sensing capability) and search for targets in a largely unknown area. The MDM framework consists of a metacognitive component and a self-cognitive component. The metacognitive component helps to self-regulate the search with multiple sensors addressing the issues of “which-sensor-to-use,” “when-to-switch-sensor,” and “how-to-search.” Based on the information gathered by sensors carried by each UAV, the self-cognitive component regulates different levels of stochastic search and switching levels for effective searching, where the lower levels of search aim to localize a target (detection) and the highest level of a search exploit a target (confirmation). The performance of the MDM framework with two sensors having a low accuracy for detection and increased accuracy to confirm targets is evaluated through Monte Carlo simulations and compared with six decentralized multi-UAV search algorithms (three self-cognitive searches and three self and social-cognitive-based searches). The results indicate that the MDM framework can efficiently detect and confirm targets in an unknown environment.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85187297862&origin=inward,"IEEE Transactions on Systems, Man, and Cybernetics: Systems",2024
BASUV: A Blockchain-Enabled UAV Authentication Scheme for Internet of Vehicles,"Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) have emerged as pivotal roles within internet of vehicles (IoV), serving as mobile base stations. However, while expanding coverage and improving mobility, the deployment of UAVs also poses a threat to the integrity and privacy of sensitive data due to open wireless communication channels in IoV. Therefore, preventing unauthorized access and data tampering is critically important between UAVs and vehicles. For the authenticity and legitimacy of the UAV certificate, existing authentication approaches may lead to significant challenges in key management overhead or dependence on a trusted third party. In this paper, a blockchain-based authentication scheme for UAV-assisted IoV system (BASUV) is proposed. This solution enables dependable UAV registration and authentication services, and permits the dynamic addition and removal. Specifically, blockchain is introduced to achieve the decentralized management and distributed trust of the UAV certificate ledger. Furthermore, to prevent information tampering and identity deception, we design CMPES, a novel combined scheme based on multiple public key generators (PKGs) for encryption and signature. Identical key pair in encryption and signature can reduce key generation and management overhead.

With the support of advanced information acquisition, information interaction and other technologies, measuring the risk threat capability of each traffic element, and using potential field theory and risk pulse theory can effectively describe the risk distribution in the road traffic environment, which is conducive to ensuring driving safety and the implementation of driving control. In this paper, we use the risk pulse energy to measure the threat ability of each traffic element, establish the corresponding driving risk pulse field based on the risk analysis of each traffic element, measure the overall risk performance and overall level of the road traffic environment from the perspectives of vector superposition and quantity superposition, and establish a unified driving risk pulse field model.

Secure Event-Triggered Sliding Control for Path Following of Autonomous Vehicles Under Sensor and Actuator Attacks,"Sensor and actuator attacks, which propagate the injected false data through CAN bus, make real threats to the security of the control of autonomous vehicles. This article attempts to solve the secure event-triggered path following control problem of autonomous vehicles subject to both sensor and actuator attacks. Firstly, a more general physical security model is established to characterize the impacts of sensor and actuator attacks on measurements and control actions. Then, feedback linearization method based on Lie derivative is exploited to linearize the established nonlinear attacked model. Thus, the nonlinear path following control is transformed into a linear case which will facilitate to the following networked-based analysis and design. Based on the established secure model, the event-triggered control scheme is utilized to alleviate communication burden under sampled-data control framework. Furthermore, the sliding control design is augmented to mitigate the malicious impacts caused by such false data injection attacks due to its inherent robustness to abnormal attack signal. Remarkably, the proposed secure sliding control can be plugged into the original control scheme rather than changing its existing control structure.

Secure Offloading With Adversarial Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning Against Intelligent Eavesdroppers in UAV-Enabled Mobile Edge Computing,"Mobile edge computing (MEC) has attracted widespread attention due to its ability to effectively alleviate the cloud computing load and significantly reduce latency. However, the potential eavesdroppers challenge the security of the MEC systems and the rapid development of artificial intelligence (AI) has made this security situation more severe. In most existing studies, the eavesdroppers are non-intelligent and it is assumed that they are fixed or move in a simple manner. Obviously, there is a gap from such an assumption to the real conditions that the eavesdropping unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) may adjust their flight paths intelligently. To better reflect real-world scenarios, we consider a multi-UAV-assisted MEC system in the presence of intelligent eavesdroppers and propose an adversarial multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL)-based scheme for secure computational offloading and resource allocation. With this scheme, we aim to solve the zero-sum game between the legitimate UAVs and the eavesdropping UAVs, in which the two types of UAVs take turns acting as the agents of MARL to alternately optimize their respective opposing objectives. The simulation experimental results indicate that the proposed scheme significantly outperforms the existing baseline methods in dealing with the intelligent eavesdropping UAVs, and ensures high energy efficiency of Internet of Things (IoT) devices even in the worst-case scenario when dealing with potential eavesdropping threats.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85200803693&origin=inward,IEEE Transactions on Mobile Computing,2024
Unveiling the Invasion: Advancing Ecological Mapping of Heterotheca Subaxillaris Through Integrated Remote Sensing Techniques With Drones and Satellites,"Invasive plant species (IPS) pose a significant threat to natural ecosystems, causing substantial global biodiversity loss. Despite the fact that only a few species invade Israel's coastal dunes, their impact on landscape and ecosystems is notable. The invasive plant Heterotheca subaxillaris, introduced a few decades ago, has aggressively spread across these dunes, becoming a major invasive species along the Israeli coast. To provide essential spatial information for ecologists and land managers, this study developed a methodology to identify and map H. subaxillaris at various scales by integrating unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) and satellite imagery. During the flowering period, drone images were employed to create multiresolution ground references using the random forest classification method, achieving 97.4% accuracy for H. subaxillaris identification. These UAV-based references validated mapping results from Vision-1 and PlanetScope satellite images, with accuracies of 96.9% and 83.3%, respectively. Vision-1 image outcomes were used as a reference for extensive probabilistic mapping using Sentinel-2 images. Given the species' small size and dispersed nature, no previous study has utilized the synergy of UAV and satellite images for multiscale mapping of H. subaxillaris. This research significantly advances detection across varying spatial resolutions, serving as a foundation for future monitoring systems with regularly acquired data. In addition, the study offers an annual phenology-based approach for identifying flowering dates through spectral indices, contributing to phenological change investigations.

Zak-Transform-Based Adaptive Interference Extraction Method for GNSS Interference Mitigation,"Unmanned aerial vehicles rely heavily on global navigation satellite systems (GNSSs) for positioning and navigation when performing tasks. At the same time, low-cost GNSS jammers can pose a severe threat to the use of GNSSs. Interference affects the work of GNSS receivers and even causes GNSS positioning to fail, thereby increasing the possibility of drone mission failure. Aiming at the current common chirp interference, this article proposes an interference mitigation method based on the Zak transform to mitigate the impact of interference on GNSS receivers. The proposed method takes advantage of the sparsity of the interfering signal at the Doppler shift axis of the delay-Doppler domain to obtain an estimation of the interference signal, which is then subtracted from the received GNSS signal to remove the interference. Simulation results show that the proposed method is more effective in mitigating interference than other methods reported in the literature.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=10491102,IEEE Transactions on Aerospace and Electronic Systems,2024
B-UAVM: A Blockchain-Supported Secure Multi-UAV Task Management Scheme,"The advent of unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) swarm technology brings possibilities to help humans complete tasks in no man’s land, such as deserts and rainforests. However, UAV network faces many cyber threats, where attackers can impersonate legitimate entities or tamper with UAV task data. For identity security, most of the existing methods use centralized authentication schemes, which have a single point of failure problem. For data security, the existing methods only secure the task data in the ground system, ignoring the data security in the air network. Therefore, the existing methods are not suitable for ubiquitous UAV scenarios. Blockchain secures data security while eliminating the single point of failure problem, and has been widely used in distributed scenarios. In this article, to secure entity identity and task data, we propose a blockchain-supported secure multi-UAV task management scheme (B-UAVM). Specifically, a three-layer blockchain structure is constructed to secure multitasks, and achieve ubiquitous control of UAV formations. Besides, six types of blocks and three types of transactions are designed to achieve safe processing and storage of task data and entity information. Furthermore, an improved practical byzantine fault tolerance (IPBFT) consensus mechanism and a UAV-formation-action-considered ground station consensus mechanism (UFAGS) are introduced in the Server Network and Ground Control Network, respectively, to accelerate the consensus. The experimental results show that the number of transactions generated per second (TPS) of B-UAVM is about  $0.5\times $  and  $3.7\times $  of the existing method when the block size or the number of blockchain nodes increases, respectively.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=10136399,IEEE Internet of Things Journal,2023
IRS-Assisted Anti-Jamming Transmission for an Integrated Satellite-UAV-Terrestrial Network With Imperfect CSI: A Game-Based Perspective,"In this article, an intelligent reflecting surface (IRS)-assisted integrated satellite-unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV)-terrestrial (SUT) Internet of Things (IoT) network faced with a smart jammer under imperfect channel state information (CSI) conditions is considered. We propose a Stackelberg game model to describe the adversarial relationship between the satellite, UAV, and IRS and the jammer, which are modeled as the leader and the follower, respectively. For the follower subgame, the jammer aims to minimize the jamming power while guaranteeing that the jamming energy efficiency surpasses a certain threshold. Under this setup, the Angle of Arrival (AoA)-based discretization method is utilized to address the imperfect CSI issue. Then, the use-and-then-forget method and the Lagrangian function are employed to obtain a closed-form expression for the jammer’s power. Finally, a feasible jamming power solution is obtained by means of the Cauchy–Schwarz inequality. For the leader subgame, we aim to optimize the hybrid beamforming design of the satellite, UAV and IRS, with the goal of minimizing the total transmit power, while guaranteeing that the downlink received signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR) surpasses the minimum communication threshold. We propose an alternating optimization scheme, in which the Cauchy–Schwarz inequality, the AoA-based discretization method, and nonsmooth penalty functions are employed to alternately obtain the optimal satellite beamforming vector, UAV beamforming vector and IRS phase matrix when the other variables are fixed. Through our analytical and numerical results, the proposed beamforming scheme achieves a reduction of 16.9% in average power consumption compared with other benchmark schemes when obtaining the same anti-jamming performance.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=10149096,IEEE Internet of Things Journal,2023
Lightweight Blockchain-Based Secure Spectrum Sharing in Space–Air–Ground-Integrated IoT Network,"Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) will be widely deployed due to their flexibility, mobility, and miniaturization, providing the necessary support for spectrum sharing between different communication systems in the space–air–ground-integrated IoT network (SAGIN). However, there are potential security threats to spectrum sharing among different communication systems due to the openness of a wireless network, the unreliability of node behavior, and the trust barriers of the networks. In this article, a secure spectrum sharing scheme based on lightweight UAV-blockchain (LUBC) is proposed to address the above security issues. First, a spectrum sharing model based on the overlay mode is developed to improve the spectrum efficiency of SAGIN, where UAVs relay signals from the satellite to the ground users in exchange for spectrum access opportunities and serve their own users simultaneously in the nonorthogonal multiple access (NOMA) mode. Second, a secure spectrum sharing framework based on LUBC is proposed to solve the security and privacy issues of spectrum trading in SAGIN. Then, aiming at maximizing the primary user’s throughput under the premise of meeting the minimum power allocation factor of UAV network, the spectrum auction based on NOMA is formulated as a multirelay selection optimization problem, which is solved by the blockchain-based sequential Vickrey auction mechanism. Finally, the security evaluation and numerical results are conducted to verify the security and effectiveness of the proposed spectrum sharing scheme for SAGIN.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=10159001,IEEE Internet of Things Journal,2023
Optimization of a Secure UAV-Based IoT: RF-Fingerprint Authentication and Resource Allocation,"Unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) technology has been developed to establish a mobile-edge computing (MEC) network for the Internet of Things (IoT). In the MEC network, users can reduce their latency by communicating and exchanging data with UAV-based edge servers. Security is a critical issue in a UAV-based IoT since the attackers who attempt to access the network may cause interference and influence the flight of the UAV. In this article, we propose a lightweight RF fingerprinting recognition method in consideration of the limited computing power in UAVs, identifying unauthenticated attackers and refusing their access to IoT. Also, we propose a resource allocation scheme in the secure UAV-based MEC network. By establishing a nonconvex resource optimization problem and decomposing it into a few tractable subproblems, we offer a numerical algorithm for the optimum resource allocation. The analysis results illustrate that our proposed method can reduce energy consumption and running time compared to its benchmark methods.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=10138659,IEEE Internet of Things Journal,2023
GoComfort: Comfortable Navigation for Autonomous Vehicles Leveraging High-Precision Road Damage Crowdsensing,"Recent years have witnessed rapid advances in autonomous driving technologies. Autonomous vehicles are more likely to be accepted if they drive comfortably to avoid potholes, bumps, and other road damage conditions, especially when there are elderly and disabled passengers on board. Traditionally, sensing road damage conditions is either labor-intensive by field investigation and reporting, or inaccurate by surveillance cameras and driving recorders due to limited perspective. In this paper, we propose GoComfort, a crowdsensing-based framework to provide low-cost and fine-grained comfortable navigation for autonomous vehicles with road damage identification leveraging high-precision road sensing data. First, we propose to exploit city-wide autonomous vehicle fleets as crowdsensing participants, and employ an edge-cloud-hybrid computing paradigm to efficiently collect high-precision road damage-related data, including 3D LiDAR point clouds and street view images. Second, we design an accurate road damage identification model fusing spatial structures of point clouds and texture features of street view images, and use an active learning-based method to address the sparse labels issue. Finally, we devise two comfortable navigation scenarios, i.e., fine-grained road damage avoidance and coarse-grained city-wide navigation, and propose a hierarchical road damage assessment diagram for comfortable route planning. Experiments using real-world road sensing data in Xiamen, China show that our approach identifies road damage conditions with an accuracy of 87.5%, and achieves a user acceptance rate of 93.8% in riding comfort evaluation, outperforming the state-of-the-art baselines.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9861719,IEEE Transactions on Mobile Computing,2023
Smart Optimization Solution for Channel Access Attack Defense Under UAV-Aided Heterogeneous Network,"6G-based wireless communication system is poised to redefine the next-generation network landscape by enabling novel services and applications, such as intelligent link establishment, power control, data collection, transmission, and distribution. However, security issues, particularly recently revealed channel access attack (CAA), present significant challenges to performance optimization tasks in the heterogeneous wireless networks of 6G, namely, Age of Information (AoI) oriented Network (AoN), Throughput oriented Network (ToN), and Latency oriented Network (LoN). To address these challenges, this article presents a game theory-based smart optimization solution to enable unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV) to resist CAA within a 6G-based heterogeneous network. Our methodology begins by outlining the advantages and challenges associated with UAV usage, followed by the design of performance indicators and intelligent resource allocation schemes under the influence of CAA. Subsequently, we introduce definitions and categories within game theory, encompassing the concept and equilibrium of three typical game models. The efficacy of our proposed framework is validated through simulation results, which demonstrate the achievement of optimal AoI, enhanced throughput, and reduced latency compared with baseline methodologies when countering CAA in a UAV-assisted heterogeneous network.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=10142004,IEEE Internet of Things Journal,2023
Energy-Efficient General PoI-Visiting by UAV With a Practical Flight Energy Model,"Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) are being widely exploited for various applications, e.g., traversing to collect data from ground sensors, patrolling to monitor key facilities, moving to aid mobile edge computing. We summarize these UAV applications and formulate a problem, namely the general waypoint-based PoI-visiting problem. Since energy is critical due to the limited onboard storage capacity, we aim at minimizing flight energy consumption. In our problem, we pay special attention to the energy consumption for turning and switching operations on flight planning, which are usually ignored in the literature but play an important role in practical UAV flights according to our real-world measurement experiments. We propose specially designed graph parts to model the turning and switching cost and thus transfer the problem into a classic graph problem, i.e., general traveling salesman problem, which can be efficiently solved. Theoretical analysis shows that such problem transformation has the graph redefinition approximation ratio upper bound, $max\lbrace \Theta /\delta,2\rbrace$max{Θ/δ,2}, where $\Theta$Θ is related to the designed graph parts and $\delta$δ is a constant. Finally, we evaluate our proposed algorithm by simulations. The results show that it costs less than 107% of the optimal minimum energy consumption for small scale problems and costs only 50% as much energy as a naive algorithm for large scale problems.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9858609,IEEE Transactions on Mobile Computing,2023
UAV Path Planning for Target Coverage Task in Dynamic Environment,"Exploiting the possibility of an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) as a powerful tool for the Internet of Things applications, such as intelligent agricultural monitoring, intelligent transportation monitoring, etc., has gradually become a hot research topic at home and abroad. While some optimization algorithms have been devised to plan the flight route of UAVs, there are still some problems with the feasibility and effectiveness of these algorithms. This article presents a solution to the UAV path planning problem for target coverage task in a dynamic environment. The methodology applies a greedy allocation strategy for task assignment and an improved ant colony optimization algorithm based on variable pheromone (ACO-VP) for path planning. First, we specify the optimal number of UAVs for the task and allocate target points to each UAV, through the greedy allocation strategy. Then, to improve the efficiency of path planning, we adjust the pheromone update rule by introducing a variable pheromone enhancement factor and a variable pheromone evaporation coefficient into the ant colony optimization (ACO) algorithm. Moreover, paths are replanned when the coverage task changes due to the increase of new target points. This method is verified through simulations and compared with other algorithms. The results show that the ACO-VP algorithm is more efficient and effective for UAV path planning than others.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=10130088,IEEE Internet of Things Journal,2023
μTesla-Based Authentication for Reliable and Secure Broadcast Communications in IoD Using Blockchain,"The Internet of Drones (IoD) manages and coordinates communications between drones in Internet of Things (IoT) applications. Ensuring security and privacy in unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) networks, i.e., drones, is essential to protect data from cyber attacks. In this context, providing authentication is a major challenge due to the fact that drones are devices limited in power capabilities. The problem is aggravated by the dynamism of IoD networks due to the high mobility of drones, being sensitive to packet loss and handovers. Blockchain technology is attractive to address the problem of centralization of existing authentication protocols. In this article, we provide a decentralized, secure, and efficient authentication protocol, based on  $\mu $ Tesla, that relies on Blockchain to manage drone authentication. We analyze the security and performance of the proposed solution.

Unmanned-Aerial-Vehicle-Aided Integrated Sensing and Computation With Mobile-Edge Computing,"Integrated sensing and communication (ISAC), which enables the joint radar sensing and data communications, shows its great potential in many intelligent applications. In this article, we investigate the unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV)-aided ISAC with mobile-edge computing (MEC), where the ISAC device deployed on the UAV senses multiple targets with the sensing scheduling and offloads the radar sensing data to the edge-server to train a machine learning model for target recognition. The radar estimation information rate is utilized to measure the radar sensing performance. We aim to minimize a systemwise cost that includes both the UAV’s energy consumption and the data collecting time, while satisfying the requirements on both the model training error and the radar sensing performance. We formulate a joint optimization problem of the sensing scheduling, the number of time-slots, the sensing power, the communication power, and the UAV trajectory. Despite the strict nonconvexity of the formulated problem, we propose an efficient algorithm for solving it. Our algorithm jointly leverages the vertical decomposition that exploits the layered structure of the formulated problem and the horizontal decomposition that utilizes the block coordinate descent (BCD) method. Numerical results are presented to validate the effectiveness of our proposed algorithms and show the performance gain of our proposed scheme.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=10107972,IEEE Internet of Things Journal,2023
UAV Target Detection for IoT via Enhancing ERP Component by Brain–Computer Interface System,"The increasing popularity of Internet of Things (IoT) devices provides a huge data source for intelligent identification. Images captured by the unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) are often exploited in target detection missions for search, rescue and fire prevention. However, without sufficient training samples, the machine learning method is usually difficult to meet application requirements. To solve the problem, a brain–computer interface (BCI) real-time system is applied to UAV target detection. In this study, a novel rapid serial visual presentation (RSVP) paradigm was formulated to present images, enhancing the ability for wide-area target detection. Since there is spatial correlation in captured images, joint decision for identical target can improve the recognition efficiency. To suppress interfering components and improve event-related potential (ERP) detection efficiency, an enhancing ERP component (EEC) algorithm is proposed. Both decision method and EEC algorithm are based on strictly statistical theory. RSVP task was performed by 12 subjects. The interference components and noise correlation were significantly reduced by the EEC algorithm. The target detection rate online was 86.6% while the false alarm rate was less than 5%. Besides, the joint decision strategy raised the area under curve (AUC) value from 0.876 to 0.963. The proposed BCI real-time system realizes the complementarity of human intelligence and IoT, ushering UAV target detection into the era of hybrid intelligence.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=10115453,IEEE Internet of Things Journal,2023
Trustworthy Sensor Fusion Against Inaudible Command Attacks in Advanced Driver-Assistance Systems,"There are increasing concerns about malicious attacks on autonomous vehicles. In particular, inaudible voice command attacks pose a significant threat as voice commands become available in autonomous driving systems. How to empirically defend against these inaudible attacks remains an open question. Previous research investigates utilizing deep learning-based multimodal fusion for defense, without considering the model uncertainty in trustworthiness. As deep learning has been applied to increasingly sensitive tasks, uncertainty measurement is crucial in helping improve model robustness, especially in mission-critical scenarios. In this article, we propose the multimodal fusion framework (MFF) as an intelligent security system to defend against inaudible voice command attacks. MFF fuses heterogeneous audio–vision modalities using VGG family neural networks and achieves the detection accuracy of 92.25% in the comparative fusion method empirical study. Additionally, extensive experiments on audio–vision tasks reveal the model’s uncertainty. Using expected calibration errors, we measure calibration errors and Monte Carlo Dropout to estimate the predictive distribution for the proposed models. Our findings show empirically to train robust multimodal models, improve standard accuracy and provide a further step toward interpretability. Finally, we discuss the pros and cons of our approach and its applicability for advanced driver assistance systems.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=10128967,IEEE Internet of Things Journal,2023
Towards a Secure and Computational Framework for Internet of Drones Enabled Aerial Computing,"In Internet of Drones (IoD), unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) or drones are deployed in various mission-critical applications to collect sensitive data and disseminate it to the server placed on the ground station. Users mostly require real-time data from the drones, instead of the information stored by the server, in specific applications to perform timely actions. However, performing real-time communication with a drone through the public communication channel, which is exposed to different security risks, mandates an authenticated key exchange (AKE) between users and drones in the IoD networks for enabling users to communicate securely with the drone through the public communication infrastructure. Moreover, real-time data acquisition from drones brings about computational overheads, making the process computationally inefficient. Thus, an efficient and lightweight AKE scheme is imperative. This article proposes a resource-efficient authentication scheme for the IoD networks, called REAS-IoD, which utilizes the lightweight hash function and authenticated encryption primitive, known as ACE, to accomplish the AKE process securely. In REAS-IoD, a user’s authentication is performed, followed by establishing a secure session key (SK) between a specific drone and the user, for the future encrypted communication. The SK’s security is established utilizing a random oracle model. We, by performing informal security verification, prove that REAS-IoD is cable of obviating different active and passive pernicious security attacks. Besides, we conduct a Scyther tool-based analysis of REAS-IoD to corroborate its security strength. Lastly, a comparative study is presented to demonstrate that without compromising security and privacy features, REAS-IoD requires fewer resource, and is computationally efficient, than the related eminent security schemes.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9714144,IEEE Transactions on Network Science and Engineering,2023
All-Day Object Tracking for Unmanned Aerial Vehicle,"Unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) has facilitated a wide range of real-world applications and attracted extensive research in the mobile computing field. Specially, developing real-time robust visual onboard trackers for all-day aerial maneuver can remarkably broaden the scope of intelligent deployment of UAV. However, prior tracking methods have merely focused on robust tracking in the well-illuminated scenes, while ignoring trackers’ capabilities to be deployed in the dark. In darkness, the conditions can be more complex and harsh, easily posing inferior robust tracking or even tracking failure. To this end, this work proposes a novel discriminative correlation filter-based tracker with illumination adaptive and anti-dark capability, namely ADTrack. ADTrack firstly exploits image illuminance information to enable adaptability of the model to the given light condition. Then, by virtue of an efficient enhancer, ADTrack carries out image pretreatment where a target aware mask is generated. Benefiting from the mask, ADTrack aims to solve a novel dual regression problem where dual filters are online trained with mutual constraint. Besides, this work also constructs a UAV nighttime tracking benchmark UAVDark135. Exhaustive experiments on authoritative benchmarks and onboard tests are implemented to validate the superiority and robustness of ADTrack in all-day conditions.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9744417,IEEE Transactions on Mobile Computing,2023
Secrecy Rate Maximization by Cooperative Jamming for UAV-Enabled Relay System With Mobile Nodes,"In recent years, unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) have been widely used in wireless communications due to their low cost, small size, flexible deployment, and mobile controllability. However, because of the Line-of-Sight (LoS) communication links, the security threat is always a challenging problem to deal with. In particular, information stolen and leakage may happen in the presence of eavesdroppers. This article proposes a UAV-enabled system with a relay UAV and a jammer UAV, and certain mobile source and destination nodes in the presence of an eavesdropper to solve the secrecy rate maximization problem. In this system, the relay UAV transmits information between pairs of moving source nodes and moving destination nodes with interrupted communication channels due to blockage or long distance, and the jammer UAV interferes with eavesdropper to reduce the milked information through sending jamming signals. We establish an average secrecy rate maximization problem with trajectory and transmit power optimization under certain constraints for this system. Since this problem is nonconvex and reformulated as the Markov decision process (MDP), we use deep reinforcement learning (DRL) method to solve it. In this article, we adopt a proximal policy optimization (PPO) algorithm to find an optimal solution because it can deal with the model of continuous action space. According to our defined states, rewards, and actions in this specified MDP, this algorithm can autonomously learn to optimize the trajectory and power allocation of the UAVs to realize our goal. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed PPO-based average secrecy rate maximization algorithm is valid, effective and scalable.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=10087301,IEEE Internet of Things Journal,2023
Sybil Attack Detection in Internet of Flying Things-IoFT: A Machine Learning Approach,"Sybil attack refers to the situation when a malicious node falsely claims to have numerous identities and is known to be one of the security threats to the Internet of Things (IoT). Due to recent increase usage of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) in various applications, Sybil attack has been identified as a threat to the flying ad hoc network (FANET) paradigm and its integration with the IoT to form the Internet of Flying Things (IoFT). In this article, we propose an intelligent Sybil attack detection approach for FANETs-based IoFT using physical layer characteristics of the radio signals emitted from the UAVs as detected by two ground nodes. A supervised machine learning approach is employed and experimented with several different classifiers available in the Weka workbench platform. The experiment was carried out based on two features of the radio signals, namely, the received signal strength difference (RSSD) and the Time Difference of Arrival (TDoA). Simulation results revealed that the proposed scheme can achieve a high correct classification accuracy of above 91% on average, even for smart malicious nodes with power control capability operating at power levels not directly trained. In addition to its high performance, the proposed scheme is also less susceptible to various attacks commonly carried out on the upper layers, such as data spoofing, due to the use of only intrinsically generated physical layer data. Furthermore, no additional communications overheads of the UAV nodes are required for the functionality of this scheme.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=10073944,IEEE Internet of Things Journal,2023
Positioning and Contour Extraction of Autonomous Vehicles Based on Enhanced DOA Estimation by Large-Scale Arrays,"As an important branch of Internet of Vehicles (IoV) systems, autonomous vehicle (AV) positioning based on direction-of-arrival (DOA) estimation has received extensive attention in recent years. In this article, an AV positioning method under unknown mutual coupling is proposed within the framework of a large-dimensional asymptotic theory (LAT). First, enhanced and closed-form DOA estimation is achieved by jointly exploiting large-scale uniform linear arrays (ULAs), Toeplitz rectification and the phase transformation result associated with the sample covariance matrix; second, a more reliable subset/set of DOAs is constructed according to the signal-to-noise at receivers; finally, robust AV positioning is achieved with the reliable subset/set. Motivated by satisfactory DOA estimation performance, an AV contour extraction scheme is developed with the aid of two antennas installed on an AV. The proposed method shows several salient advantages compared with existing methods, including improved resolution and accuracy, reduced computational complexity, robustness to mutual coupling and unreasonable DOA estimates, as well as the ability to effectively extract AV contour information.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=10044148,IEEE Internet of Things Journal,2023
Noncooperative and Cooperative Urban Intelligent Systems: Joint Logistic and Charging Incentive Mechanisms,"Autonomous vehicles (AVs) have become an emerging crucial component of the intelligent transportation system (ITS) in modern smart cities. In particular, coordinated operations of AVs can potentially enhance the quality of public services, e.g., logistic and AV charging services. However, the joint logistic and AV charging scenario involves the sophisticated interactions between a large number of complicated agents, dynamic logistics, and electricity prices in real-world systems. Since AVs are individuals owned by different parties, the design of attractive incentive to motivate them to provide multiple public services becomes a fundamental issue. In this article, we develop an urban intelligent system (UIS) by exploiting the efficient incentive mechanisms, e.g., noncooperative and cooperative game-theoretic approaches, to motivate the AVs to provide logistic and charging services in UIS. For the noncooperative game approach, we formulate the interaction between the selfish AVs and the aggregator as a Stackelberg game. Meanwhile, the aggregator, known as the leader in the game, aims to decide the logistic and electricity trading prices, and then the AVs, executed as the followers, determine their service schedules. Furthermore, considering that all the players are willing to cooperate, we develop a cooperative potential game for the selfless AVs to maximize the social welfare of the UIS. These case studies demonstrate the effectiveness and practicability of proposed incentive mechanisms that can motivate EVs to provide high-quality logistic and charging services by maximizing their utilities. Also, both the proposed schemes provide significant system revenues than that of conventional system optimization-based approaches.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=10044214,IEEE Internet of Things Journal,2023
AUV-Assisted Stratified Source Location Privacy Protection Scheme Based on Network Coding in UASNs,"The position of the source is sensitive and critical information in underwater acoustic sensor networks (UASNs). In this study, a network coding-based scheme called the stratified source location privacy protection scheme (SSLP-NC) with autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV) is suggested for a strong adversary that can decode data. First, for the adversary with passive attacks, several fake source selection algorithms are suggested for two circumstances where the source is in the shallow and deep sea, respectively. Each node then utilizes a pseudo-random number generator to create sequences on a regular basis so that the key data can be delivered to the sink without interference. Then, for the adversary with the active attack, the node encrypts the source and fake data using the pre-existing pseudo-random number sequence as an encoding vector to thwart the adversary’s decryption. Further, this work develops a relay node selection approach for transmitting the encoded data, which increases the variety of the data transmission pathways. Finally, this study includes a hole avoidance strategy that uses nodes or an AUV to address the potential hole issue. The simulation demonstrates that the SSLP-NC successfully fends off an adversary that can decode data packets, and performs better than the EECOR and DBR-MAC algorithms in terms of network safe time and packet delivery rate.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=10026869,IEEE Internet of Things Journal,2023
A2RID—Anonymous Direct Authentication and Remote Identification of Commercial Drones,"The recent worldwide introduction of RemoteID (RID) regulations forces all unmanned aircrafts (UAs), also known as drones, to broadcast in plaintext on the wireless channel their identity and real-time location, for accounting and monitoring purposes. Although improving drones’ monitoring and situational awareness, the RID rule also generates significant privacy concerns for UAs’ operators, threatened by the ease of tracking of UAs and related confidentiality and privacy concerns connected with the broadcasting of plaintext identity information. In this article, we propose anonymous direct authentication and remote identification ( $A^{2}RID$ ), a protocol suite for  $A^{2}RID$  of heterogeneous commercial UAs.  $A^{2}RID$  integrates and adapts protocols for anonymous message signing to work in the UA domain, coping with the constraints of commercial drones and the tight real-time requirements imposed by the RID regulation. Overall, the protocols in the  $A^{2}RID$  suite allow a UA manufacturer to pick the configuration that best suits the capabilities and constraints of the drone, i.e., either a processing-intensive but memory-lightweight solution (namely,  $CS-A^{2}RID$ ) or a computationally friendly but memory-hungry approach (namely,  $DS-A^{2}RID$ ). Besides formally defining the protocols and formally proving their security in our setting, we also implement and test them on real heterogeneous hardware platforms, i.e., the Holybro X-500 and the ESPcopter, releasing open-source the produced code. For all the protocols, we demonstrated experimentally the capability of generating anonymous RemoteID messages well below the time bound of 1 s required by RID, while at the same time having quite a limited impact on the energy budget of the drone.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=10029376,IEEE Internet of Things Journal,2023
Dependency Tasks Offloading and Communication Resource Allocation in Collaborative UAV Networks: A Metaheuristic Approach,"Nowadays, unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs)-assisted mobile-edge computing (MEC) systems have been exploited as a promising solution for providing computation services to mobile users outside of terrestrial networks. However, it remains challenging for standalone UAVs to meet the computation requirement of numerous users due to their limited computation capacity and battery lives. Therefore, we propose a collaborative scheme among UAVs to share the workload between them. Furthermore, this work is the first to consider the task topology of offloading in MEC-enabled UAVs networks while restricting their power consumption. We study the task topology, in which a task consists of a set of subtasks, and each subtask has dependencies upon other subtasks. In the real world, subtasks with dependencies must wait for their preceding subtasks to complete before being executed, and this affects the offloading strategy. Next, we formulate an optimization problem to minimize the average latency of users by jointly controlling the offloading decision for dependent tasks and allocating the communication resources of UAVs. The formulated problem is NP-hard and cannot be solved in polynomial time. Therefore, we divide the problem into two subproblems: 1) offloading decision problem and 2) communication resource allocation problem. Then, a metaheuristic method is proposed to find the suboptimal solution to the former problem, while the latter problem is solved by using convex optimization. Finally, we conduct simulation experiments to prove that our proposed offloading technique outperforms several benchmark schemes in minimizing the average latency of users for dependency tasks and achieving higher uplink transmission rates.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=10004947,IEEE Internet of Things Journal,2023
Wireless Distributed Consensus for Connected Autonomous Systems,"Connected critical autonomous systems (C-CASs) are envisioned to significantly change our life and work styles through emerging vertical applications, such as autonomous vehicles and cooperative robots. However, as the scale of the connected nodes continues to grow, their heterogeneity and cybersecurity threats are more eminent, and conventional centralized communications and decision-making methodology are reaching their limit. This article is the first exploration of a trustworthy and fault-tolerant framework for C-CAS for achieving hyperreliable global decision making in a trustless environment, where the connected sensors/nodes are less reliable due to either communication failure or local decision error (e.g., by sensing algorithm/AI, etc.). The proposed framework is based on two iconic distributed consensus (DC) mechanisms: 1) practical Byzantine fault tolerance (PBFT) and 2) Raft, under the proposed perception-initiative-consensus-action (PICA) protocol with wireless connections among the nodes. We first analytically derived consensus reliability in six different system models. The other fundamental performance metrics, such as the consensus throughput and latency, node scalability, and reliability gain are also analytically derived. These analytical results provide basic design guidelines for wireless DC (WDC) usage in the C-CAS systems. The results show that WDC significantly improves overall system reliability with the increasing number of participating nodes.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9990047,IEEE Internet of Things Journal,2023
Spatial-Temporal Modeling and Analysis of Reliability and Delay in Urban V2X Networks,"The fifth-generation (5G) based vehicle-to-everything (V2X) communication is a promising technology to enhance both manned and unmanned driving systems. To this end, the 5G V2X networks should satisfy stringent requirements on transmission reliability and delay for exchanging safety-critical messages (SCMs). A joint analysis of transmission reliability and delay in V2X communication networks is thus crucial, particularly in urban 5G V2X networks. This was considered prohibitive due to the complicated spatial-temporal dynamics of V2X communications caused by interference, channel fading, as well as queueing and retransmission of SCMs. Moreover, urban 5G V2X networks are typically deployed in a finite area, where locations of nodes are spatially correlated and cannot be conveniently modeled as Poisson point process (PPP). In this paper, we propose a novel binomial point process (BPP) based analytic framework for modeling the spatial-temporal dynamics of urban 5G V2X communications and characterizing transmission reliability and delay of SCM exchange jointly. The presented framework captures not only the spatial distribution of interference and channel fading during uplink and downlink transmissions, but also the temporal dynamics associated with queueing and retransmissions of SCMs. Exploiting the stochastic geometry theory and queueing theory, closed-form expressions of transmission reliability and delay are derived, which are further validated using Monte Carlo simulations. Both the numerical and simulation results reveal complicated couplings between the transmission reliability and delay in different operation regimes. Nevertheless, the proposed analytical framework can accurately capture the reliability-delay relations.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=10006403,IEEE Transactions on Network Science and Engineering,2023
Pistis: Replay Attack and Liveness Detection for Gait-Based User Authentication System on Wearable Devices Using Vibration,"Wearable devices-based biometrics has become mainstream in the biometric domain, especially in mobile computing, due to its convenience, flexibility, and potentially high user acceptance. Among various modalities, wearable devices-based gait recognition has been recognized as an effective user authentication method and employed in various applications, such as automated entry systems for home, school, work, vehicles, and automated ticket payment/validation for public transport. However, how secure wearable gait remains an open research question. In this study, we conduct a comprehensive security analysis of the wearable gait. Then, we demonstrate that gait itself is not robust against some attacking methods, such as spoofing or forgery. Therefore, we argue that an anti-spoofing mechanism is important for enhancing the security of wearable gait biometric systems. To this end, we proposed a novel authentication protocol called  $Pistis$  that embedded gait biometrics and a liveness detection mechanism that is aiming to detect various attacks of gait authentication systems. Our extensive experiments based on 50 subjects demonstrate that  $Pistis$  is effective in liveness detection and authentication performance enhancement, providing 100% accuracy for human and nonhuman detection, and 99.53% accuracy for user authentication. Pistis can be used as a liveness detection method for wearable devices-based biometrics, significantly for wearable gait.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9996544,IEEE Internet of Things Journal,2023
A Hybrid Deep Sensor Anomaly Detection for Autonomous Vehicles in 6G-V2X Environment,"Autonomous Vehicles (AVs) exchange real-time and seamless data between other AVs and the network, thus revolutionizing the Intelligent Transportation System (ITS). Automated transportation brings numerous benefits to human beings. However, the concerns such as safety, security, and privacy keep rising. In navigation and trajectory planning, the AVs require exchanging sensory information from their own and other AVs. In such cases, when a malicious AV or faulty sensor-equipped AV comes into connectivity, it can have disruptive consequences. This paper proposes a Hybrid Deep Anomaly Detection (HDAD) approach for effective anomaly detection and cyber-attack mitigation in AVs. The Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL) algorithm in HDAD approach acts over the 6G network to combat new-age cyber-attacks and provide a swift and accurate anomaly detection mechanism.

Unmanned Aerial Vehicle as Encryption Key Distributor for Secure Communications in Smart Grid,"We use symmetric cryptography for secure communications with resource-limited smart grid control devices. We propose the novel idea of using the unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) as a physical courier to carry secret key bits generated at the control center to remote control devices. While distributing secret keys, the UAV may be attacked in an attempt to sabotage secure communications. The UAV may fly a longer route to avoid attackers but it has a limited onboard battery capacity and must visit each device within a time limit to prevent a secret key deficit. We formulate an optimization to find the lowest attack risk flight route for secret key distribution while taking into consideration key deficiency and battery capacity. Such optimization is NP-hard. We further propose an efficient algorithm to find a low-risk flight route in less than a second, even for a large power grid system with more than a hundred nodes. For large systems, we modify the proposed algorithm to find a low-risk flight route as well as to determine the required UAV flight duration and battery size. Extensive simulation results confirm the superiority of the proposed algorithm against a baseline scheme that is ignorant of attackers.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9973272,IEEE Internet of Things Journal,2023
Dynamic UAV Deployment for Differentiated Services: A Multi-Agent Imitation Learning Based Approach,"Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) have been utilized to serve on-ground users with various services, e.g., computing, communication and caching, due to their mobility and flexibility. The main focus of many recent studies on UAVs is to deploy a set of homogeneous UAVs with identical capabilities controlled by one UAV owner/company to provide services. However, little attention has been paid to the issue of how to enable different UAV owners to provide services with differentiated service capabilities in a shared area. To address this issue, we propose a multi-agent imitation learning enabled UAV deployment approach to maximize both profits of UAV owners and utilities of on-ground users. Specially, a Markov game is formulated among UAV owners and we prove that a Nash equilibrium exists based on the full knowledge of the system. For online scheduling with incomplete information, we design agent policies by imitating the behaviors of corresponding experts. A novel neural network model, integrating convolutional neural networks, generative adversarial networks and a gradient-based policy, can be trained and executed in a fully decentralized manner with a guaranteed $\epsilon$ε-Nash equilibrium. Performance results show that our algorithm has significant superiority in terms of average profits, utilities and execution time compared with other representative algorithms.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9552547,IEEE Transactions on Mobile Computing,2023
Traffic Analysis Through Deep-Learning-Based Image Segmentation From UAV Streaming,"Alongside many traditional as well as novel applications, in the latest years, drones have been widely adopted as remote sensing platforms for road traffic monitoring in urban areas and on highways. The problem of traffic monitoring on Region of Interest (RoI) based on drone imagery is a challenging task, especially when the surveillance drone is constantly moving. In this work, two specific subtasks have been addressed. The goal of the first stage is to predict the RoI in drone imagery of traffic scenes using deep-learning (DL)-based approaches instead of traditional image processing; in this connection, the goal of the second task is to perform vehicle detection on the selected RoI. To ensure diversity and robustness, drone images with different altitudes, positions, and view points have been considered. To achieve these goals, two custom aerial data sets for RoI extraction and detection were built by collecting aerial sequences from flying unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) and by transmitting them to the base station leveraging 5G technology. Two different ad hoc DL-based architectures have been designed for the RoI extraction task to maximize the accuracy and inference speed, respectively, and have been evaluated on two different data sets: 1) a custom-built data set and 2) a Massachusetts roads data set. Finally, the models providing the best performance have been combined to further improve the overall results. Experimental tests show that the proposed framework represents a promising solution for drone-based road traffic monitoring in critical areas, exploiting imagery from a variety of viewing angles and altitudes.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9955239,IEEE Internet of Things Journal,2023
A Triggerless Backdoor Attack and Defense Mechanism for Intelligent Task Offloading in Multi-UAV Systems,"In recent years, multiunmanned aerial vehicular systems (MUAVs) have become prevalent in divergent applications: agriculture, spectrum utilization, transportation, forest fire monitoring, and among others, due to their flexible, robust, and autonomous operational maneuver. Battery-powered multiunmanned aerial vehicles (MUAVs) systems possess limited computation and communication resources, significantly reducing their functional dimension by limiting mission time and range. To address this issue, we propose a federated deep reinforcement learning (FDRL)-based intelligent and decentralized task offloading scheme for resource-constrained UAVs that can enhance the operational capability of the MUAV systems. Moreover, the proposed FDRL scheme can improve offloading policy quality while preserving data privacy in MUAV. However, such intelligent systems may fall prey to backdoor attacks that can intervene in the system’s regular operation causing rapid degradation of its performance. We introduce a novel triggerless backdoor attack scheme on intelligent task offloading UAVs and analyze its impact to gauge the resiliency of the offloading policy in the presence of an adversary. Then, we propose lightweight agnostic defense mechanisms to combat such backdoors in multi-UAV settings. The extensive simulation results show that the proposed attack and defense strategies are practical and efficient.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9770193,IEEE Internet of Things Journal,2023
AD-RCNN: Adaptive Dynamic Neural Network for Small Object Detection,"With the large-scale commercialization of 5G networks, Internet of Things (IoT) applications keep on emerging in recent years. Real-time environmental awareness is an essential part of various IoT applications, e.g., self-driving vehicles. Object detection plays a fundamental role in real-time environmental awareness, which is responsible for acquiring valuable object information from the environment automatically. Despite of the fast progress for object detection in general, small object detection still faces challenges. Because of the restricted scales, small objects are only capable of generating relatively week features after multiple convolutional layers, thus causing low detection accuracy. Existing schemes mostly focus on extracting rich multiscale features, e.g., generating high-resolution features through generative adversarial networks (GANs), or generating multiscale features through feature combination. Nevertheless, these schemes require complex network implementation, and usually suffer from high processing delay because of high-resolution images. To resolve the problems mentioned above, we propose an adaptive dynamic neural network (AD-RCNN) that consists of three fundamental improvements. We first propose a dynamic region proposal network to improve the quality of region proposals. We then introduce a visual attention scheme to generate features of regions. Finally, we put forward an adaptive dynamic training module to optimize final detection results. Experimental results demonstrate that AD-RCNN outperforms the state-of-the-art from the perspectives of mAP and frames per second (FPS). Specifically, at the resolution of 1024 of TT100K data set, AD-RCNN achieves 68.8% mAP, which outperforms the baseline Faster RCNN by 8.52%.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9924201,IEEE Internet of Things Journal,2023
Flying Among Stars: Jamming-Resilient Channel Selection for UAVs Through Aerial Constellations,"Wireless communication between an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) and the ground base station is susceptible to adversarial jamming. In such situations, it is important for the UAV to indicate a new channel to the BS. This paper describes a method of creating spatial codes that map the chosen channel to the location of the UAVs in space, wherein the latter physically traverses the space from a given so called ”constellation points” to another. These points create patterns in the sky, analogous to modulation constellations in classical wireless communications, and are detected at the BS through a millimeter-wave radar sensor. A constellation point represents a distinct n-bit field mapped to a specific channel, allowing simultaneous frequency switching at both ends without any RF transmissions. The main contributions of this paper are: (i) We conduct experimental studies to demonstrate how such constellations may be formed using COTS UAVs and mmWave sensors, (ii) We develop a theoretical framework that maps a desired constellation design to error and band switching time, including multi-user scenario-specific challenges, (iii) We compare our approach against current FHSS technology and (iv) We experimentally demonstrate jamming resilient communications and validate system goodput for links formed by UAV-mounted software defined radios.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9508187,IEEE Transactions on Mobile Computing,2023
"Unmanned-Aerial-Vehicle-Assisted Wireless Networks: Advancements, Challenges, and Solutions","The rapid development of communication and computing techniques enables unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) to provide reliable and cost-effective wireless communication and computing services from the air. Compared to the conventional fixed infrastructure, UAVs have attractive attributes, such as high flexibility and operability, and, as a result, on-demand line-of-sight connection links. Therefore, UAV-assisted wireless networks have been envisioned as a promising paradigm to achieve enhanced coverage and connectivity for future wireless communications. Meanwhile, achieving high levels of energy efficiency, sensing, communication, and computing capacities, and security and privacy are critical to the success of UAV-assisted wireless networks. In order to improve the performance of UAV-assisted wireless networks, some frameworks and mechanisms have been developed in the past few years. In this article, we provide a comprehensive survey of these developments. Specifically, we conduct a brief overview for the architecture of UAV-assisted wireless networks from four domains (i.e., framework-related, technology-related, challenge-related, and solution-related) and four aspects (i.e., sensing-related, communication-related, computing-related, and application-related). Then, the integrated sensing, communication, and computing for UAV-assisted wireless networks is introduced, followed by the characteristics and requirements.

Observer-Based Event-Triggered Sliding Mode Control for Secure Formation Tracking of Multi-UAV Systems,"This article is concerned with the problem of the secure formation tracking of multiple unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) subject to replay attacks, where an observer-based event-triggered sliding mode control approach is adopted. First, a novel attack model is established for multi-UAV systems considering replay attacks, in which the issue of the replay attack beginning and ending within a sampling period is solved. Then, a switched event-triggered scheme is developed for multi-UAV systems subject to replay attacks, under which the corresponding communication mechanisms are invoked for different attack states. This communication scheme brings lower data releasing rate and less energy consumption based on the severity level of replay attacks while the desired tracking performance is ensured. On the basis of the sliding mode control theory, observer-based event-triggered formation tracking strategies are developed for multi-UAV systems with nonlinearities under replay attacks by combining the interactive information from neighbors. Sufficient conditions of the multi-UAV system to achieve the desired formation are obtained by utilizing Lyapunov stability approach. Finally, a simulation example with multiple UAVs is performed to demonstrate the validity of the developed formation control strategy.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9961897,IEEE Transactions on Network Science and Engineering,2023
Machine Learning Insights for Behavioral Data Analysis Supporting the Autonomous Vehicles Scenario,"The advent of the digital innovation era is changing service, use, and resources management paradigms, offering a wide range of new and essential opportunities. In particular, the advent of the Internet of Things (IoT), i.e., the ability to connect individual objects to the Internet, also capable of communicating autonomously, has its particular declination on the connected vehicle. It is combined with the potential of advanced sensors placed pervasively on vehicles, which offer multifunctional monitoring capabilities of the entire system: from individual components up to the whole vehicle, including driver behavior and conditions and many exogenous parameters to the vehicle (road and weather conditions, congestion, risk situations, changes to mobility plans, etc.). In this perspective, machine learning (ML) models can transform raw data into new knowledge; they can contribute in an innovative way to define and suggest decisions, strategies, and criteria for resource use. Nowadays, most intelligent mobility projects also integrate artificial intelligence (AI) and ML solutions.

Adversarial Attacks Against Acoustic Monitoring of Industrial Machines,"The recent rise of adversarial machine learning exposed the serious vulnerabilities existing in current frameworks depending on the smooth operation of such automated solutions. This article focuses on the critical field of monitoring the health of industrial machines based on the respective acoustic emissions. After building an audio-based monitoring solution using log-Mel spectrograms and convolutional neural networks, we systematically evaluate the applicability of four types of adversarial attacks: 1) fast gradient sign; 2) projected gradient descent; 3) Jacobian saliency map; and 4) Carlini and Wagner  $\ell _{\infty }$ . Seeing the problem from the attacker perspective, we designed two different attack types, aiming at inducing either false positives or false negatives. We define three figures of merit specifically designed to assess the performance of each attack type from diverse points of view. The experimental setup relies on a publicly available data set including acoustic emissions representing four industrial machines, i.e., fan, pump, slider rail, and valve.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9844239,IEEE Internet of Things Journal,2023
Collaboration-Aware Relay Selection for AUV in Internet of Underwater Network: Evolving Contextual Bandit Learning Approach,"In Internet of Underwater Things, data collection is assisted by autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV) to enhance the reliable transmission. AUV acts as a mobile collector and transmits the collected data to the station via relay nodes. However, the highly mobile nature of AUV needs an adaptive and efficient relay selection scheme for achieving good capacity performance. In this article, we propose a new contextual multiarmed bandit with evolving relay set (CMAB-ERS) learning framework, which successfully addresses crucial issues, including dynamic environment conditions and evolving relay set. To deal with the evolving relay set, CMAB-ERS incorporates collaborative effects into inference as well as learning processes, the new relays will acquire prior knowledge by having experienced nodes sharing observations, reducing the learning time significantly. To overcome the uncertainty of environmental information, we exploit the contextual environment factors to assist relay reward estimation and execute time-sensitive parameter update after every transmit–receive cycle, aiming for minimizing potential loss due to the time-varying channel. Correspondingly, the collaboration-aware online contextual bandit learning (COCBL) algorithm is designed that enables AUV to switch optimal relay adaptively and promises high-capacity transmission. Further, we rigorously prove the convergence of the COCBL algorithm by considering the evolving relay set and give its upper bound on the cumulative regret. Finally, extensive simulation results elucidate the effectiveness of the proposed COCBL.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9910599,IEEE Internet of Things Journal,2023
Deep Reinforcement Learning for Aerial Data Collection in Hybrid-Powered NOMA-IoT Networks,"With the help of unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV), remote terminals that out of wireless coverage can be connected to the Internet of Things (IoT) networks. Currently, the IoT relies on a large number of low-cost wireless sensors with limited energy supply to realize ubiquitous monitoring and intelligent control. The hybrid-powered networks composed of wireless-powered communication (WPC) terminal and solar-powered UAV can solve the energy supply problem of the IoT networks, and the nonorthogonal multiple access (NOMA) technique can solve the massive access problem of IoT terminals. Exploiting these benefits, we investigate joint UAV 3-D trajectory design and time allocation for aerial data collection in hybrid-powered NOMA-IoT networks. To maximize the total fair network throughput, we jointly consider energy limitation, Quality of Service (QoS) requirements, and flight conditions. The problem is nonconvex and time-dimension coupled which is intractable to solve by traditional optimization methods. Therefore, we develop a deep reinforcement learning (DRL) algorithm called fair communication is accomplished by trajectory design and time allocation (FC-TDTA), which uses the deep deterministic policy gradient (DDPG) as its basis. Simulation results show that our proposed algorithm performs better than benchmarks in fair throughput maximization. The proposed FC-TDTA algorithm can make the UAV: 1) fly in appropriate direction and speed, so that the UAV can arrive at the charging station before the energy runs out and 2) conduct WPC energy transmission and data collection to achieve fair communication.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9903854,IEEE Internet of Things Journal,2023
Continual Barlow Twins: Continual Self-Supervised Learning for Remote Sensing Semantic Segmentation,"In the field of earth observation (EO), continual learning (CL) algorithms have been proposed to deal with large datasets by decomposing them into several subsets and processing them incrementally. The majority of these algorithms assume that data are, first, coming from a single source, and second, fully labeled. Real-world EO datasets are instead characterized by a large heterogeneity (e.g., coming from aerial, satellite, or drone scenarios), and for the most part they are unlabeled, meaning they can be fully exploited only through the emerging self-supervised learning (SSL) paradigm. For these reasons, in this article, we present a new algorithm for merging SSL and CL for remote sensing applications that we call continual Barlow twins. It combines the advantages of one of the simplest self-supervision techniques, i.e., Barlow twins, with the elastic weight consolidation method to avoid catastrophic forgetting. In addition, we evaluate the proposed continual SSL approach on a highly heterogeneous EO dataset, showing the effectiveness of this strategy on a novel combination of three almost non-overlapping domains datasets (airborne Potsdam, satellite US3D, and drone unmanned aerial vehicle semantic segmentation dataset), on a crucial downstream task in EO, i.e., semantic segmentation. Encouraging results show the superiority of SSL in this setting, and the effectiveness of creating an incremental effective pretrained feature extractor, based on ResNet50, without the need of relying on the complete availability of all the data, with a valuable saving of time and resources.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=10135093,IEEE Journal of Selected Topics in Applied Earth Observations and Remote Sensing,2023
Deep Learning-Based Anomaly Detection for Connected Autonomous Vehicles Using Spatiotemporal Information,"Although connected mymargin autonomous vehicles (CAVs) hold great potential to improve driving safety and experience significantly, cybersecurity remains a critical concern. As the de-facto standard for in-vehicle networks, the Controller Area Network (CAN) carries messages and commands vital to the operation of the vehicle. However, due to a lack of security mechanisms, intruders are able to conduct devastating attacks on drivers and passengers over CAN. In order to safeguard CAVs, an Intrusion Detection System (IDS) can be deployed to monitor CAN network activities and detect suspicious behavior resulting from an attack. This paper proposes a prediction-based IDS framework for detecting anomalies and attacks on a CAN bus using temporal correlation of message contents. Two candidates are introduced as the prediction module. The first network is an LSTM that predicts time series data separately for each CAN ID, and the second is a ConvLSTM that predicts messages using correlated data of several CAN IDs. An attack is classified according to prediction errors by a Gaussian Naïve Bayes classifier. The proposed IDS is evaluated against other state-of-the-art one-class classifiers, including OCSVM, Isolation Forest, and Autoencoder, and three existing works, including ReducedInception-ResNet, NeuroCAN, and CANLite, using a real-world dataset, the Car Hacking Dataset. A comparison between the two suggested architectures and their use cases is given. Compared to baseline methods and related studies, the proposed method is shown to be more accurate and can achieve F-scores and detection accuracy of almost 100%.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=10164214,IEEE Transactions on Intelligent Transportation Systems,2023
Infrastructure-Enabled GPS Spoofing Detection and Correction,"Accurate and robust localization is crucial for supporting high-level driving automation and safety. Modern localization solutions rely on various sensors, among which GPS has been and will continue to be essential. However, GPS can be vulnerable to malicious attacks and GPS spoofing has been identified as a high threat. With transportation infrastructure becoming increasingly important in supporting emerging vehicle technologies and systems, this study explores the potential of applying infrastructure data for defending against GPS spoofing. We propose an infrastructure-enabled framework using roadside units as an independent, secured data source. A real-time detector, based on the Isolation Forest, is constructed to detect GPS spoofing. Once spoofing is detected, GPS measurements are isolated, and the potentially compromised location estimator is corrected using secure infrastructure data. We test the proposed method using both simulation and real-world data and show its effectiveness in defending against various GPS spoofing attacks, including stealthy attacks that are proposed to fail the production-grade autonomous driving systems.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=10208233,IEEE Transactions on Intelligent Transportation Systems,2023
Secure Cooperative Path Following of Autonomous Surface Vehicles Under Cyber and Physical Attacks,"This paper is concerned with the networked cooperative path following (CPF) problem for multiple autonomous surface vehicles (ASVs) subject to simultaneous cyber and physical attacks. First, to compensate the adverse effects of the physical-attack-induced bias injections, an extended state observer is designed to provide real-time estimates of the unmeasured velocities and unknown nonlinear terms. Next, to identify and handle various cyber attacks, a novel secure data transmission mechanism, featuring a secure transmitter and a secure receiver, is developed for each ASV. Then, a secure CPF control scheme, consisting of a networked cooperative kinematic control law and a networked kinetic control law, is presented. Furthermore, the observer error dynamics and networked CPF error dynamics are derived to account for the simultaneous network-induced delays, packet dropouts, physical attacks, and cyber attacks. The proposed control scheme is capable to preserve satisfactory secure tracking performance of the resulting CPF control system under a desired reference path even in the presence of external environmental disturbances, delays, packet dropouts, and malicious attacks. Finally, several case studies are provided to substantiate the effectiveness of the secure CPF control scheme.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=10108032,IEEE Transactions on Intelligent Vehicles,2023
Robust Image-Based Landing Control of a Quadrotor on an Unpredictable Moving Vehicle Using Circle Features,"This paper addresses the landing problem of a quadrotor on an unpredictable moving vehicle, using a robust image-based visual servoing (IBVS) method. The circle-based image moments are defined to construct image dynamics, and the passivity-like property of the circle features is preserved by reprojecting to the virtual image plane. The landing control system is decoupled into translation and rotation modules due to the rotation invariance of the proposed circle features. First, by exploiting the error transformation in the image space, a robust IBVS controller can overcome the lack of both the desired depth information of target features and the velocity feedback of the target. Next, an adaptive geometric attitude controller is developed directly using rotation matrices to avoid the singularities of Euler-angles and the ambiguity of quaternions. One benefit of the proposed scheme is that it can potentially improve the camera visibility, guarantee the transient and steady-state behaviors in image space, and be efficiently implemented on the low-cost quadrotor. Finally, The stability analysis is presented using Lyapunov stability theory on cascaded systems, and the effectiveness of the proposed control strategy is demonstrated through simulations and experiments. Note to Practitioners—The motivation of this paper is to investigate a practical control strategy for the image-based landing control of underactuated quadrotors on an unpredictable moving vehicle. In most of the existing image-based landing control schemes for underactuated quadrotors, having the prior predictive model of the moving landing vehicle to provide a feed-forward compensation during the landing maneuver. However, due to the fact that the landing environment and vehicle are primarily stochastic, resulting in no predictive models are valid in practice. Therefore, this paper suggests a robust image-based landing control strategy without the model or state of the moving landing vehicle. In particular, a novel virtual circle feature, possessing the characteristic of rotation invariance, is designed for the landing of underactuated quadrotors, which decouples the landing system and simplifies the control design. Moreover, the image feature errors are directly retained within prescribed performance funnels in the image space. As a result, the transient and steady-state landing behaviors can be implicitly guaranteed in Cartesian space. The stability and convergence of the system are analyzed mathematically and the experiment using quadrotors provides promising results. In ongoing research, we are addressing the issues of collision avoidances and unknown disturbances to provide a more realistic setup for the autonomous deployment and recovery of underactuated quadrotors in GPS-denied environments.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9791477,IEEE Transactions on Automation Science and Engineering,2023
"A Systematic Survey: Security Threats to UAV-Aided IoT Applications, Taxonomy, Current Challenges and Requirements With Future Research Directions","Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) as an intermediary can offer an efficient and useful communication paradigm for different Internet of Things (IoT) applications. Following the operational capabilities of IoTs, this emerging technology could be extremely helpful in the area, where human access is not possible. Because IoT devices are employed in an infrastructure-less environment, where they communicate with each other via the wireless medium to share accumulated data in network topological order.

UAV penetration mission path planning based on improved holonic particle swarm optimization,"To meet the requirements of safety, concealment, and timeliness of trajectory planning during the unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) penetration process, a three-dimensional path planning algorithm is proposed based on improved holonic particle swarm optimization (IHPSO). Firstly, the requirements of terrain threat, radar detection, and penetration time in the process of UAV penetration are quantified. Regarding radar threats, a radar echo analysis method based on radar cross section (RCS) and the spatial situation is proposed to quantify the concealment of UAV penetration. Then the structure-particle swarm optimization (PSO) algorithm is improved from three aspects. First, the conversion ability of the search strategy is enhanced by using the system clustering method and the information entropy grouping strategy instead of random grouping and constructing the state switching conditions based on the fitness function. Second, the unclear setting of iteration numbers is addressed by using particle spacing to create the termination condition of the algorithm. Finally, the trajectory is optimized to meet the intended requirements by building a predictive control model and using the IHPSO for simulation verification. Numerical examples show the superiority of the proposed method over the existing PSO methods.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=10005043,Journal of Systems Engineering and Electronics,2023
Wheel-INS2: Multiple MEMS IMU-Based Dead Reckoning System With Different Configurations for Wheeled Robots,"A reliable self-contained navigation system is essential for autonomous vehicles. Based on our previous study on Wheel-INS [1], a wheel-mounted inertial measurement unit (Wheel-IMU)-based dead reckoning (DR) system, in this paper, we propose a multiple IMUs-based DR solution for the wheeled robots. The IMUs are mounted at different places on the wheeled vehicles to acquire various dynamic information. In particular, at least one IMU has to be mounted at the wheel to measure the wheel velocity and take advantage of the rotation modulation. The system is implemented through a distributed extended Kalman filter structure where each subsystem (corresponding to each IMU) retains and updates its own states separately. The relative position constraints between the multiple IMUs are exploited to further limit the error drift and improve the system’s robustness. Particularly, we present the DR systems using dual Wheel-IMUs, one Wheel-IMU plus one vehicle body-mounted IMU (Body-IMU), and dual Wheel-IMUs plus one Body-IMU as examples for analysis and comparison. Field tests illustrate that the proposed multi-IMU DR system outperforms the single Wheel-INS in terms of both positioning and heading accuracy. By comparing with the centralized filter, the proposed distributed filter shows unimportant accuracy degradation while holding significant computation efficiency. Moreover, among the three multi-IMU configurations, the one Body-IMU plus one Wheel-IMU design obtains the minimum drift rate. The position drift rates of the three configurations are 0.82% (dual Wheel-IMUs), 0.69% (one Body-IMU plus one Wheel-IMU), and 0.73% (dual Wheel-IMUs plus one Body-IMU), respectively.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9950438,IEEE Transactions on Intelligent Transportation Systems,2023
The OpenCDA Open-Source Ecosystem for Cooperative Driving Automation Research,"Advances in Single-vehicle intelligence of automated driving has encountered great challenges because of limited capabilities in perception and interaction with complex traffic environments. Cooperative Driving Automation (CDA) has been considered a pivotal solution to next-generation automated driving and smart transportation. Though CDA has attracted much attention from both academia and industry, exploration of its potential is still in its infancy. In industry, companies tend to build their in-house data collection pipeline and research tools to tailor their needs and protect intellectual properties. Reinventing the wheels, however, wastes resources and limits the generalizability of the developed approaches since no standardized benchmarks exist. On the other hand, in academia, due to the absence of real-world traffic data and computation resources, researchers often investigate CDA topics in simplified and mostly simulated environments, restricting the possibility of scaling the research outputs to real-world scenarios. Therefore, there is an urgent need to establish an open-source ecosystem (OSE) to address the demands of different communities for CDA research, particularly in the early exploratory research stages, and provide the bridge to ensure an integrated development and testing pipeline that diverse communities can share. In this paper, we introduce the OpenCDA research ecosystem, a unified OSE integrated with a model zoo, a suite of driving simulators at various resolutions, large-scale real-world and simulated datasets, complete development toolkits for benchmark training/testing, and a scenario database/generator. We also demonstrate the effectiveness of OpenCDA OSE through example use cases, including cooperative 3D LiDAR detection, cooperative merge, cooperative camera-based map prediction, and adversarial scenario generation.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=10045043,IEEE Transactions on Intelligent Vehicles,2023
Dynamic Reallocation Model of Multiple Unmanned Aerial Vehicle Tasks in Emergent Adjustment Scenarios,"Due to their strong risk tolerance, low manufacturing cost, and good maneuverability, unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) have been widely used in various fields. Among related challenges, coordinated task assignment is a key scientific issue for autonomous control of UAVs. In this article, based on the idea of fuzzy C-means clustering and the ant colony optimization algorithm, a cooperative multiple task reallocation problem with target precedence constraints for heterogeneous UAVs is proposed. The contributions of this research are the performance evaluation of the original algorithms in a dynamic context, consideration of changes in some attributes of the environment, and the extension of these algorithms to properly address more realistic dynamic emergent adjustment scenarios. According to the corresponding task reallocation strategy, the scenarios are divided into three categories: the complete redistribution strategy can effectively cope with scenarios where tasks have changed significantly, the partial adjustment strategy can induce partial responses to the changes of individual tasks, and group redistribution can effectively solve the problem of task target threat rating changes. The simulation results show that the dynamic reallocation model of multi-UAV tasks in dynamic emergent adjustment scenarios can achieve better performance to complete the corresponding tasks based on the proposed scheme. In addition, we deployed the developed graphical modeling and analysis software platform to implement the dynamic reallocation model of multi-UAV tasks in dynamic emergent scenarios, and the validity and reliability of the proposed task reallocation model were verified.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9847033,IEEE Transactions on Aerospace and Electronic Systems,2023
The Effect of Vehicle Automation Styles on Drivers’ Emotional State,"Self-driving vehicles promise many safety, mobility, and environmental benefits. However, users’ lack of trust and acceptance may threaten the success and potential of this technology. Monitoring the driver’s emotional state is one way to address this challenge. Empathetic automation can respond to the driver’s state and improve the experience and acceptance of self-driving vehicle drivers. In this study, 24 participants rode in a self-driving vehicle simulator and experienced three automation styles (aggressive, moderate, conservative) and four intersection types (with and without a stop sign, and with and without traffic.) We identified the observed drivers’ emotions from the video data and labeled the video frames using the dimensional and discrete emotion models to examine how automation behavior affects the driver’s emotional state. We used multilevel Bayesian linear regression and multilevel Dirichlet regression to model the continuous and discrete emotions, respectively. The automation driving style effect varied for each participant. The same conditions provoked positive responses for some participants, and negative for others. Furthermore, the results showed that intersection type, the position within the intersection, and their interaction affected the driver’s emotional state.

Therefore, the number of handovers may increase, and the process of sharing authentication keys between drones to new drones may be vulnerable to eavesdropping due to the wireless connectivity. For example, a UAV initially served by cell A may be handed over to cell B after a certain point. Therefore, Security and privacy concerns raise if there is a change in the flight path of the UAV due to wide-area connectivity traffic management, including authentication threats as well as the leakage of identity, location, and flying routes. Also, drones are resource-constrained devices that cannot perform extensive operations, leading to the inability to resist drone capture attacks and impersonation attacks. Therefore, this paper presents a high-performance and efficient anonymous handover authentication protocol to secure the drone traveling path. The protocol utilizes the advantages of the AES-RSA algorithm to provide efficient and secure key management and a fast verification and signature generation that speeds up drone authentication. The protocol's security was proved using the formal verification ROR model and automated security verifier ProVerif tool to validate the protocol resistance against various attacks and provided forward secrecy. In addition, the performance of the proposed protocol is evaluated using the OMNeT++ simulator in terms of communication, computation cost, energy consumption, packet drop ratio, end-to-end delay, and throughput. The results showed that the protocol achieves better security, efficiency, and performance than other protocols.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=10082875,IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology,2023
"Data Poisoning Attacks in Internet-of-Vehicle Networks: Taxonomy, State-of-The-Art, and Future Directions","With the unprecedented development of deep learning, autonomous vehicles (AVs) have achieved tremendous progress nowadays. However, AV supported by DNN models is vulnerable to data poisoning attacks, hindering the large-scale application of autonomous driving. For example, by injecting carefully designed poisons into the training dataset of the DNN model in the traffic sign recognition system, the attacker can mislead the system to make targeted misclassification or cause a reduction in model classification accuracy. In this article, we conduct a thorough investigation of the state-of-the-art data poisoning attacks and defenses against AVs. According to whether the attacker needs to manipulate the data labeling process, we divide the state-of-the-art attack approaches into two categories, i.e., dirty-label attacks and clean-label attacks. We also differentiate the existing defense methods into two categories based on whether to modify the training data or the models, i.e., data-based defenses and model-based defenses. In addition to a detailed review of attacks and defenses in each category, we also give a qualitative comparison of the existing attacks and defenses. Besides, we provide a quantitative comparison of the existing attack and defense methods through experiments. Last but not least, we pinpoint several future directions for data poisoning attacks and defenses in AVs, providing possible ways for further research.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9855872,IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics,2023
AdvDDoS: Zero-Query Adversarial Attacks Against Commercial Speech Recognition Systems,"Automatic speech recognition (ASR) has been widely and commercially employed in health care, autonomous vehicles, and finance. Yet, recent studies have shown that universal adversarial perturbations (UAPs) pose a serious threat to white-box ASR systems when the adversary has access to the target model. Until now, the impacts of such a threat on commercial systems are still open since their models are not publicly available. To understand the security weakness in the practical black-box setting, this paper introduces the first zero-query UAP attacks, called AdvDDoS, with black-box access to ASR systems: we do not need to pay any query expense to estimate UAPs. Specifically, we craft targeted UAPs under a popular feature extractor and a local ASR model by reversing the robust target-category features, in which adversarial perturbations containing robust features are believed to have better transferability. Compared with vanilla UAPs, our UAPs incorporated with target-category features lead to better attacks against commercial ASR systems. We validate the efficacy of our AdvDDoS by launching attacks against a range of commercial ASR systems, i.e., three API services (Alibaba, Tencent, and Baidu), and three personal assistants (Apple Siri, iFlytek, and Google). Extensive experimental results demonstrate the superiority of AdvDDoS. For example, AdvDDoS achieves 83.26% word error rate (WER) and 53.25% success rates of attacks (SRoA) for the universal attack against Tencent ASR API, which outperforms the vanilla UAPs by up to 61.56% on WER and 11.6% on SRoA. The success of our attack sheds light on zero-query UAP attacks against commercial ASR systems.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=10145466,IEEE Transactions on Information Forensics and Security,2023
Robust Decision Making for Autonomous Vehicles at Highway On-Ramps: A Constrained Adversarial Reinforcement Learning Approach,"Reinforcement learning has demonstrated its potential in a series of challenging domains. However, many real-world decision making tasks involve unpredictable environmental changes or unavoidable perception errors that are often enough to mislead an agent into making suboptimal decisions and even cause catastrophic failures. In light of these potential risks, reinforcement learning with application in safety-critical autonomous driving domain remains tricky without ensuring robustness against environmental uncertainties (e.g., road adhesion changes or measurement noises). Therefore, this paper proposes a novel constrained adversarial reinforcement learning approach for robust decision making of autonomous vehicles at highway on-ramps. Environmental disturbance is modelled as an adversarial agent that can learn an optimal adversarial policy to thwart the autonomous driving agent. Meanwhile, observation perturbation is approximated to maximize the variation of the perturbed policy through a white-box adversarial attack technique. Furthermore, a constrained adversarial actor-critic algorithm is presented to optimize an on-ramp merging policy while keeping the variations of the attacked driving policy and action-value function within bounds. Finally, the proposed robust highway on-ramp merging decision making method of autonomous vehicles is evaluated in three stochastic mixed traffic flows with different densities, and its effectiveness is demonstrated in comparison with the competitive baselines.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9994638,IEEE Transactions on Intelligent Transportation Systems,2023
CMX: Cross-Modal Fusion for RGB-X Semantic Segmentation With Transformers,"Scene understanding based on image segmentation is a crucial component of autonomous vehicles. Pixel-wise semantic segmentation of RGB images can be advanced by exploiting complementary features from the supplementary modality ( ${X}$ -modality). However, covering a wide variety of sensors with a modality-agnostic model remains an unresolved problem due to variations in sensor characteristics among different modalities. Unlike previous modality-specific methods, in this work, we propose a unified fusion framework, CMX, for RGB-X semantic segmentation. To generalize well across different modalities, that often include supplements as well as uncertainties, a unified cross-modal interaction is crucial for modality fusion. Specifically, we design a Cross-Modal Feature Rectification Module (CM-FRM) to calibrate bi-modal features by leveraging the features from one modality to rectify the features of the other modality. With rectified feature pairs, we deploy a Feature Fusion Module (FFM) to perform sufficient exchange of long-range contexts before mixing. To verify CMX, for the first time, we unify five modalities complementary to RGB, i.e., depth, thermal, polarization, event, and LiDAR. Extensive experiments show that CMX generalizes well to diverse multi-modal fusion, achieving state-of-the-art performances on five RGB-Depth benchmarks, as well as RGB-Thermal, RGB-Polarization, and RGB-LiDAR datasets. Besides, to investigate the generalizability to dense-sparse data fusion, we establish an RGB-Event semantic segmentation benchmark based on the EventScape dataset, on which CMX sets the new state-of-the-art. The source code of CMX is publicly available at https://github.com/huaaaliu/RGBX_Semantic_ Segmentation.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=10231003,IEEE Transactions on Intelligent Transportation Systems,2023
Off-Policy Learning-Based Following Control of Cooperative Autonomous Vehicles Under Distributed Attacks,"This paper investigates the resilient distributed secure output path following control problem of heterogeneous autonomous ground vehicles (AGVs) subject to cyber attacks based on reinforcement learning algorithm. Most existing results are subject to the same attack models for all communication channels, however multiple channels launched by different attackers are considered in this paper. First, a predictor-acknowledgement clock algorithm for each vehicle is proposed to judge whether the communication channel among neighboring vehicles is attacked or not by receiving or transmitting an acknowledgement. Then, a resilient distributed predictor is proposed to predict the pinning vehicle’s state for each vehicle. In addition, a resilient local control protocol consisting of the feedforward state provided by the predictor and the local feedback state of each vehicle is developed for the output path following problem, which is further converted to the optimal control problem by designing a discounted performance function. Discounted algebraic Riccati equations (AREs) are derived to address the optimal control problem. An off-policy reinforcement learning (RL) algorithm is put forward to learn the solution of discounted AREs online without any prior knowledge of vehicles’ dynamics. It is shown that the RL-based output path following control problem of AGVs imposed by cyber attacks can be achieved in an optimal manner. Finally, a numerical example is provided to verify the effectiveness of theoretical analysis.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=10038626,IEEE Transactions on Intelligent Transportation Systems,2023
Secure and Efficient UAV Tracking in Space-Air-Ground Integrated Network,"With the development of 5G and other communication techniques, the space-air-ground integrated network (SAGIN) is regarded as a promising solution to provide wide-range, cost-effective, and real-time wireless access. Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) Tracking plays a crucial role in guaranteeing the performance of SAGIN. However, UAV tracking still faces a series of challenges in the real-world deployment, especially in the case of the presence of malicious attackers, who may launch a series of attacks (e.g., message spoofing attack, routing misbehavior attack) to disrupt the systems. In this study, to enhance the security and efficiency of SAGIN when conducting object tracking, we propose a novel and secure object tracking system named SecTracker to overcome the emerging security problems in the SAGIN. Focusing on the unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) tracking, we design the Local Voting based Detection Module to defend the message spoofing attack and implement the Routing Evidence based Detection Module to defend the routing misbehavior attack. Besides, efficiency enhancement mechanisms (i.e., probabilistic detection algorithm and game theory based algorithm) are proposed in this paper to improve the efficiency of SecTracker. Considering the above-mentioned attacks, the overall tracking accuracy is improved from 88.16% in existing schemes to 96.64% in SecTracker, which demonstrates the effectiveness of the proposed system.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=10064000,IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology,2023
Multi-Agent System for Rogue Drone Interception,"A multitude of applications based on unmanned aircraft vehicles (UAVs), in conjunction with the UAVs' diminishing costs and increasing capabilities, present a major threat to public safety as well as critical infrastructure security, leading to the need for versatile and robust counter-drone solutions. This work presents a novel multi-agent jamming system, where a group of cooperative autonomous agents employ various algorithms (detection, tracking, jamming, and self-localization) to counter unauthorized drone operations. The proposed system employs a joint wireless jamming and cooperative positioning framework to best track and intercept the moving rogue drone, utilizing a relative positioning system based on signals of opportunity in conjunction with inertial and vision measurements. Software-defined radio technology is incorporated on the pursuer agent to achieve rogue drone GPS disruption, while at the same time the autonomous agents cooperate to compute the location estimate of the pursuer agent. In the presence of jamming, to improve the wireless communication performance of the autonomous agents, a cellular communication architecture is also used as an additional channel for control and information exchange. For evaluation purposes, a prototype multi-agent system is designed, implemented, and tested in a real-world environment to demonstrate its enhanced localization and jamming performance, when compared to single-agent approaches.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=10044959,IEEE Robotics and Automation Letters,2023
On-Board Deep-Learning-Based Unmanned Aerial Vehicle Fault Cause Detection and Classification via FPGAs,"With the increase in the use of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs)/drones, it is important to detect and identify causes of failure in real time for proper recovery from a potential crash-like scenario or postincident forensics analysis. The cause of crash could be either a fault in the sensor/actuator system, a physical damage/attack, or a cyber attack on the drone's software. In this work, we propose novel architectures based on deep convolutional and long short-term memory neural networks to detect (via autoencoder) and classify drone misoperations based on real-time sensor data. The proposed architectures are able to learn high-level features automatically from the raw sensor data. Empirical results show that our solution is able to detect (with over 90% accuracy) and classify various types of drone misoperations [with about 99% accuracy (simulation data) and up to 85% accuracy (experimental data)].

Jamming and Eavesdropping Defense Scheme Based on Deep Reinforcement Learning in Autonomous Vehicle Networks,"As a legacy from conventional wireless services, illegal eavesdropping is regarded as one of the critical security challenges in Connected and Autonomous Vehicles (CAVs) network. Our work considers the use of Distributed Kalman Filtering (DKF) and Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) techniques to improve anti-eavesdropping communication capacity and mitigate jamming interference. Aiming to improve the security performance against smart eavesdropper and jammer, we first develop a DKF algorithm that is capable of tracking the attacker more accurately by sharing state estimates among adjacent nodes. Then, a design problem for controlling transmission power and selecting communication channel is established while ensuring communication quality requirements of the authorized vehicular user. Since the eavesdropping and jamming model is uncertain and dynamic, a hierarchical Deep Q-Network (DQN)-based architecture is developed to design the anti-eavesdropping power control and possibly channel selection policy. Specifically, the optimal power control scheme without prior information of the eavesdropping behavior can be quickly achieved first. Based on the system secrecy rate assessment, the channel selection process is then performed when necessary. Simulation results confirm that our jamming and eavesdropping defense technique enhances the secrecy rate as well as achievable communication rate compared with currently available techniques.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=10016623,IEEE Transactions on Information Forensics and Security,2023
Attribute-Based Data Sharing Scheme With Flexible Search Functionality for Cloud-Assisted Autonomous Transportation System,"The existing group public key encryption with equality test schemes could only support one-to-one data sharing and are not suitable for cloud-assisted autonomous transportation systems, which demand one-to-many data sharing. To tackle this problem efficiently, in this article, we put forward the group-attribute-based encryption with equality test (G-ABEET) scheme. The presented G-ABEET allows sensors equipped in vehicles to encrypt traffic data with an expressive access policy before sharing it. Only users with attributes required by the access policy ought to access the shared ciphertexts, thus achieving selective one-to-many data sharing. Meanwhile, the authorized cloud server could provide group users with equality tests over the ciphertexts, realizing ciphertext search ability. Furthermore, with the group mechanism, the G-ABEET scheme could resist offline message recovery attacks. Besides, in the standard model, we give rigorous security proof of the G-ABEET construction. The feasibility and efficiency of G-ABEET are demonstrated by experimental simulations.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=10038533,IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics,2023
A Differential Fault Attack on Security Vehicle System Applied SIMON Block Cipher,"With the application of new technologies in vehicles such as wireless communications, microelectronics, Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Autonomous Vehicles (AV), there are lots of embedded hardware and software in vehicles, and so cryptographic technologies such as block ciphers are also applied to the vehicle system to protect its security and privacy. In order to better find potential security vulnerabilities and improve security of the vehicle system which applied SIMON block cipher, in this paper, a novel Differential fault attack (DFA) method is presented. By inducing a random bit fault in  $L^{T-4}$  (the fourth round from the last), we first demonstrate the process of identifying the fault-induced position. Then, on the basis of the determined position, we describe how to retrieve three rounds of keys by inducing only one round of faults. For retrieving the SIMON family, compared with previous DFAs under the random bit fault model, the lowest numbers of fault-induced and fault locations (or rounds) are required by our attack. In particular, when the key words  $m$  is 2 or 3, the proposed attack only needs to induce one round of faults. Finally, we carry out simulation verification and a comparison to illustrate the correctness and effectiveness of the proposed attack.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9740036,IEEE Transactions on Intelligent Transportation Systems,2023
D2D-MAP: A Drone to Drone Authentication Protocol Using Physical Unclonable Functions,"With the continuous miniaturization of electronic devices and the recent advancements in wireless communication technologies, Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs), in general, and Small Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (SUAVs, a.k.a., drones), in particular, are becoming progressively used by the civilian sector within the context of a variety of applications, bringing great convenience to the public. However, due to their resource-constrained nature, risky environmental application, and wireless way of communication, drones are not immune from cyberthreats. As a consequence, the security of drones (SUAVs) has recently gained significant attention by the research community. In particular, when it comes to inter-drone communication. Although traditional cryptographic techniques may provide a certain level of security, they actually constitute a heavy burden on SUAVs due to their resource-constrained nature. In the light of enforcing the security of inter-drone communications, this paper proposes a lightweight drone-to-drone authentication protocol, called D2D-MAP, that uses PUF (Physical Unclonable Function) technology. We design the protocol and evaluate its resilience against various attacks. We use resource-constrained hardware to implement the authentication protocol and perform an evaluation of its performance. We show that the protocol's security and the obtained performance are prominent compared to state-of-the-art authentication protocols, and that they conform to SUAVs security and performance requirements.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9963641,IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology,2023
Robust Localization for Secure Navigation of UAV Formations Under GNSS Spoofing Attack,"Nowadays, aerial formations are frequently employed in outdoor scenarios to cooperatively explore and monitor wide areas of interest. In these applications, the vehicles are often exposed to relevant security vulnerabilities, as, for instance, the alteration of navigation signals from an attacker with map counterfeiting (if not even hijacking) purposes. In this work, we focus on an Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) formation that monitors an area, wherein navigation spoofing attacks may occur. Letting the UAVs cooperate and exploiting the redundancy in the available sensing information, a distributed procedure is proposed to  $i$ ) detect spoofing attacks, and  $ii$ ) support the navigation in adverse conditions. The validity of the designed approach is confirmed by numerical results. Aerial vehicles for outdoor operation are generally endowed with inertial measurements, relative ranging, and GNSS sensing capability. In this work, two cascaded estimation algorithms for concurrent GNSS spoofing detection and localization in a multi-UAV scenario is proposed, to attain robust navigation in areas subject to GNSS spoofing attacks. The attack detection leverages on information theoretic tools to provide a practical threshold test by checking the multimodal measurement consistency. The localization procedures exploit a decision logic relying on measurement reliability to combine information sources that are different in nature, for UAV self-localization in both safe and under-attack conditions.

Benchmark Evaluation of Hybrid Fixed-Flapping Wing Aerial Robot With Autopilot Architecture for Autonomous Outdoor Flight Operations,"This letter is focused on the benchmark evaluation and comparison of the flapping and fixed wing flight modes on an hybrid platform developed for the realization of autonomous inspection operations outdoors. The platform combines the high range and endurance of fixed-wing UAVs (unmanned aerial vehicles), with the higher maneuverability and intrinsic safety of flapping wing in the interaction with humans during the hand launch and capture. A unified model of the hybrid platform is derived for both configurations following the Lagrange formulation to express the multi-body dynamics and aerodynamic forces of the flapping wing and the propellers. The proposed control scheme exploits the similarities of both flight modes in the tail actuation and in the generation of thrust either with the flapping wings or the propellers, in such a way that it can be implemented on conventional autopilots, facilitating in this way the adoption of this type of aerial platforms. To evaluate and compare the performance of both modes, a set of benchmark tests and metrics are defined, including the energy efficiency in forward flight, trajectory tracking, hand launch and capture, and accuracy in visual inspection. Experimental results in outdoors validate the developed prototype, identifying the fixed/flapping transitions, and evidencing the higher energy efficiency of the flapping wing mode compared to the fixed wing.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=10138070,IEEE Robotics and Automation Letters,2023
Lightweight Trustworthy Message Exchange in Unmanned Aerial Vehicle Networks,"Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) networks have huge potential for a variety of military and civilian uses, such as intelligent transportation system, smart city, and so on. The 6th Generation (6G) communication technology is expected to provide 3-Dimensional (3D) wireless coverage and greatly improve the performance of UAV networks. The UAV-to-UAV (U2U) message exchange (or message exchange for short) is an important basis of multi-UAV cooperation. However, due to the unique characteristics of UAV networks, the U2U messages (or messages for short) are vulnerable to both the external and internal attackers. In this work, we propose a Lightweight Trustworthy Message Exchange (LTME) scheme for UAV networks by efficiently aggregating the cryptography and trust management technologies. In the LTME scheme, a centralized Ground Control Station (GCS) periodically updates the reputation levels of registered UAVs (or UAVs for short) and securely distributes secret values to the UAVs. Based on the received secret values, each trustworthy broadcasting UAV can generate its encrypted messages so that only trustworthy receiving UAVs can decrypt them, and each trustworthy receiving UAV can accurately judge whether the received messages and the corresponding broadcasting UAVs are trustworthy in a lightweight manner. Furthermore, we present a simplified LTME (sLTME) scheme and conduct a comprehensive theoretical analysis and simulation evaluation for the LTME and sLTME schemes.

Three-Dimensional Trajectory Design for Unmanned Aerial Vehicle-Based Secure and Energy-Efficient Data Collection,"Fixed-wing unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) provide a practical means for data collection in many Internet-of-Things (IoT) applications. Secrecy and energy efficiency are crucial to the data collection, but have never been well addressed in the lack of appropriate propulsion energy models for three-dimensional (3D) flights of fixed-wing UAVs. This paper delivers a new approach to the joint optimization of the 3D flight trajectory and data collection schedule of a fixed-wing UAV for secure and energy-efficient data collection under an eavesdropping attack. A critical aspect is that we derive a new propulsion energy model for fixed-wing UAVs flying 3D trajectories. By using equivalent transformation, difference-of-convex techniques, and successive convex approximation, we convexify the model and demonstrate its viability to the design of energy-efficient 3D trajectories. Another key aspect is that we further optimize the trajectory and schedule of the UAV for secure and energy-efficient collection of secret data from sensor nodes on the ground. This is non-trivial due to the convexification of the non-smooth secrecy constraints in addition to the new 3D propulsion energy model. Simulations validate the new model and demonstrate considerable energy saving of 3D trajectories, compared to two-dimensional (2D) trajectories optimized based on the state-of-the-art 2D propulsion energy model.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9875063,IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology,2023
A Multicriteria-Based Forwarding Strategy for Interest Flooding Mitigation on Named Data Wireless Networking,"In wireless networks, the Named Data Networking (NDN) architecture maximizes contents’ availability throughout multiple network paths based on multicast-based communication combined with stateful forwarding and caching in intermediate nodes. Despite its benefits, the downside of the architecture resides in the packet flooding not efficiently prevented by current forwarding strategies and mainly associated with the native flooding of the architecture or malicious packets from Interest Flooding Attack (IFA). This work introduces iFLAT, a multicriteria-based forwarding strategy for interest FLooding mitigATion on named data wireless networking. It follows a cross-layer approach that considers: (i) the Received Signal Strength (RSS) to adjust itself to the current status of the wireless network links, (ii) the network traffic (meInfo) to detect flooding issues and traffic anomalies, and (iii) a fake Interest Blacklist to identify IFA-related flooding. In doing so, the strategy achieves better efficiency on Interest flooding mitigation, addressing both native and IFA types of flooding. We evaluated the proposed strategy by reproducing a Flying Ad hoc Network (FANET) composed of Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) featured by the NDN stack deployed in all nodes. Simulation results show that iFLAT can effectively detect and mitigate flooding, regardless of its origin or nature, achieving greater packet forwarding efficiency than competing strategies. In broadcast storm and IFA scenarios, it achieved 25.75% and 37.37% of traffic reduction, whereas Interest satisfaction rates of 16.36% and 51.78% higher, respectively.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9888056,IEEE Transactions on Mobile Computing,2023

Secure Computation Offloading for Marine IoT: An Energy-Efficient Design via Cooperative Jamming,"In smart ocean, the Marine Internet of Things (M-IoT) is ubiquitously used for data acquisition, communication connections, task computation, and so on. However, high-efficient energy consumption and secure yet low-latency transmission is subject to IoT devices' computation capacity and transmit power limitation, as well as wireless communication's broadcast characteristics. In this paper, we investigate the secure computation offloading in M-IoT with the assistance of unmanned surface vehicles (USVs) subject to the eavesdropping attack. In particular, we consider a scenario in which USVs are firstly scheduled to set up a high-quality communication link to the high altitude platform (HAP) and then exploited to provide cooperative jamming for the communication security at the physical layer when the HAP is performing computation offloading. We jointly optimize the USVs' positions, the duration of data uploading, the workload offloaded by HAP, the HAP's transmission power, and each USV's jamming signal power to minimize the system-wise energy consumption for completing the total workloads under the latency constraint. Despite the non-convexity, we decompose the problem vertically into a top problem that optimizes the USVs' positions and a bottom problem that optimizes the other variables. The Polyblock outer Approximation and bisection Search based algorithm (PAS-Algorithm) is proposed to alternatively optimize the variables in the bottom problem. And the Code bAsed croSs Entropy algorithm (CASE-Algorithm) is proposed to obtain the suboptimal solution to the formulated joint optimization problem.

Joint mission and route planning of unmanned air vehicles via a learning-based heuristic,"Unmanned air vehicles (UAVs) have been regularly employed in modern wars to conduct different missions. Instead of addressing mission planning and route planning separately, this study investigates the issue of joint mission and route planning for a fleet of UAVs. The mission planning determines the configuration of weapons in UAVs and the weapons to attack targets, while the route planning determines the UAV's visiting sequence for the targets. The problem is formulated as an integer linear programming model. Due to the inefficiency of CPLEX on large scale optimization problems, an effective learning-based heuristic, namely, population based adaptive large neighborhood search (P-ALNS), is proposed to solve the model. In P-ALNS, seven neighborhood structures are designed and adaptively utilized in terms of their historical performance. The effectiveness and superiority of the proposed model and algorithm are demonstrated on test instances of small, medium and large sizes. In particular, P-ALNS achieves comparable solutions or as good as those of CPLEX on small-size (20 targets) instances in much shorter time.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=10018314,Journal of Systems Engineering and Electronics,2023

TAGKA: Threshold Authenticated Group Key Agreement Protocol Against Member Disconnect for UANET,"The development of unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) technology has been advancing rapidly and is widely applied in various domains. Compared to a single UAV, the multi-UAV system, known as the UAV Ad Hoc Network (UANET), can collaborate to accomplish complex tasks more efficiently. Due to the UAVs communicating through open wireless channels, they are vulnerable to various attacks. Group key agreement protocols are often used to guarantee the security of UANET communication. However, the high dynamics of UAVs and the instability of the wireless links often result in certain UAVs temporarily losing connection with the group, rendering them incapable of participating in the group key agreement process. Regrettably, existing literature on group key agreement does not consider this issue, which makes them not applicable to UANET. To address this issue, we propose a threshold authenticated group key agreement protocol (TAGKA) that can resist the disconnection of group members. Then, considering that the temporarily disconnected UAVs need to obtain the latest group key after the communication links are recovered, we design a group key recovery protocol. The security of the scheme is proved under the random oracle model. Moreover, formal security verification using the Tamarin and rigorous informal security analysis is also performed. Finally, we use NS-3 to simulate the protocol, and the experimental results show that our protocol can be effectively applied to UANET.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=10158389,IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology,2023

Joint Multi-Domain Resource Allocation and Trajectory Optimization in UAV-Assisted Maritime IoT Networks,"The integration of Maritime Internet of Things (M-IoT) technology and unmanned aerial/surface vehicles (UAVs/USVs) has been emerging as a promising navigational information technique in intelligent ocean systems. In this article, we consider the UAV-assisted M-IoT network where USVs offload computation-intensive maritime tasks via non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) to the UAV equipped with the mobile-edge computing (MEC) server subject to the UAV mobility. To improve the energy efficiency of offloading transmission and workload computation, we focus on minimizing the total energy consumption by jointly optimizing the USVs’ offloaded workload, transmit power, computation resource allocation, as well as the UAV trajectory subject to the USVs’ latency requirements. Despite the nature of mixed discrete and non-convex programming of the formulated problem, we exploit the vertical decomposition and propose a two-layered algorithm for solving it efficiently. Specifically, the top-layered algorithm is proposed to solve the problem of optimizing the UAV trajectory based on the idea of deep reinforcement learning (DRL), and the underlying algorithm is proposed to optimize the underlying multidomain resource allocation problem based on the idea of the Lagrangian multiplier method. Numerical results are provided to validate the effectiveness of our proposed algorithms as well as the performance advantage of NOMA-enabled computation offloading in terms of overall energy consumption.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9865231,IEEE Internet of Things Journal,2023
AI-Empowered Trajectory Anomaly Detection and Classification in 6G-V2X,"The immense growth of Autonomous Vehicles (AVs) and networking technologies have paved the way for advanced Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS). AVs increase data demands from in-vehicle users, which pose a significant risk to the vehicular trajectory data and are extremely vulnerable to security threats. It is challenging to describe and detect the trajectory anomalies in urban motion behavior due to the enormous coverage and complexity of ITS in the V2X environment. Most existing systems rely on a restricted number of single detection strategies, such as determining frequent patterns and have limited accuracy in detecting anomalous trajectories. However, they focus only on outlier detection, failing to consider different patterns of anomalous trajectories. This paper proposes Efficient Trajectory Anomaly Detection and Classification (ETADC) framework in a 6G-V2X environment. The proposed ETADC framework employs the Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient algorithm (DDPG) to improve accuracy and efficiency by analyzing multiple strategies, namely driving speed, driving distance, driving direction, and driving time. The result analysis shows that the proposed ETADC technique outperforms the existing systems by 97% accuracy.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9863890,IEEE Transactions on Intelligent Transportation Systems,2023
A Repeated Unknown Game: Decentralized Task Offloading in Vehicular Fog Computing,"Offloading computation to nearby edge/fog computing nodes, including the ones carried by moving vehicles, e.g., vehicular fog nodes (VFN), has proved to be a promising approach for enabling low-latency and compute-intensive mobility applications, such as cooperative and autonomous driving. This work considers vehicular fog computing scenarios where the clients of computation offloading services try to minimize their own costs while deciding which VFNs to offload their tasks. We focus on decentralized multi-agent decision-making in a repeated unknown game where each agent, e.g., service client, can observe only its own action and realized cost. In other words, each agent is unaware of the game composition or even the existence of opponents. We apply a completely uncoupled learning rule to generalize the decentralized decision-making algorithm presented in [7] for the multi-agent case. The multi-agent solution proposed in this work can capture the unknown offloading cost variations susceptive to resource congestion under an adversarial framework where each agent may take implicit cost estimation and suitable resource choice adapting to the dynamics associated with volatile supply and demand. According to the evaluation via simulation, this work reveals that such individual perturbations for robustness to uncertainty and adaptation to dynamicity ensure a certain level of optimality in terms of social welfare, e.g., converging the actual sequence of play with unknown and asymmetric attributes and lowering the correspondent cost in social welfare due to the self-interested behaviors of agents.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=10122978,IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology,2023
Joint Optimization of Relay Selection and Transmission Scheduling for UAV-Aided mmWave Vehicular Networks,"To deal with the explosive growth of mobile traffic, millimeter-wave (mmWave) communications with abundant bandwidth resources have been applied to vehicular networks. As mmWave signal is sensitive to blockage, we introduce the unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV)-aided two-way relaying system for vehicular connection enhancement and coverage expansion. How to improve transmission efficiency and to reduce latency time in such a dynamic scenario is a challenging problem. In this paper, we formulate the joint optimization problem of relay selection and transmission scheduling, aiming to reduce transmission time while meeting the throughput requirements. To solve this problem, two schemes are proposed. The first one is the random relay selection with concurrent scheduling (RCS), a low-complexity algorithm implemented in two steps. The second one is the joint relay selection with dynamic scheduling (JRDS), which fully avoids relay contentions and exploits potential concurrent ability, to obtain further performance enhancement over RCS. Through extensive simulations under different environments with various flow numbers and vehicle speeds, we demonstrate that both RCS and JRDS schemes outperform the existing schemes significantly in terms of transmission time and network throughput. We also analyze the impact of threshold selection on achievable performance.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=10012329,IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology,2023
Toward Optimal Deployment of UAV Relays in UAV-Assisted Internet of Vehicles,"The past decade has witnessed an explosive growth of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), which have attracted great attention in assisting Internet of Vehicles (IoV) communication systems thanks to the advantages of cost-effectiveness, high maneuverability, and flexible deployment. Yet several issues, such as UAVs' transmit power and energy resources as well as the high-speed mobility of IoV user equipment (VUE), pose challenges to the development of UAVs in UAV-assisted IoV. To provide reliable and high-throughput wireless links for VUEs in a given ground area, this article considers a scenario in which a ground VUE is facing difficulties in receiving service from a ground roadside unit (RSU) owing to possible sudden RSU malfunction or poor signal coverage. In this case, UAVs are generally deployed in the air, serving as relays to establish communication links between uncovered VUE and the neighboring RSU. To maximize the system capacity, we investigate the deployment problem of UAV relays under single-UAV relaying and multi-UAV relaying cases upon considering VUE mobility, and exploit the optimal deployment strategy of UAV relays under fixed total power consumption. Comprehensive simulation results verify that the proposed algorithm can outperform benchmark methods on significant critical indicators such as the average achievable user rate, and the outage probability. Also, evaluations and analyses have highlighted the effects of key system parameters (e.g., altitude, number, and transmit power of UAV relays) on optimal UAV relay deployment position and system performance.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=10117548,IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology,2023
Joint Optimization of Resource Allocation and Flight Trajectory for UAV-IoT Underwater Detecting Systems,"In a marine underwater object detecting system, sonobuoys collect underwater acoustic data and then wirelessly transmit it to an agile and controllable unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV), which, in turn, relays the raw data to the terrestrial computing center for further processing. However, constrained by the limitations in communication bandwidth and vehicle maneuverability, the UAV cannot fly over each sonobuoy to gather all the raw data within the prescribed period. In addition, to effectively detect the underwater object, we should also exploit diverse acoustical measurements of different sonobuoys (e.g., triangulation scheme) and maintain a certain level of throughput fairness among sonobuoys. Consequently, for efficient detection, both the bandwidth allocation and flight trajectory must be jointly optimized according to the importance of each sonobuoy. To this end, based on the α-fairness utility function, we design a bandwidth allocation strategy that assigns radio resource to a sonobuoy according to its weight. Similarly, in each searching round, the flying trajectory is also repeatedly optimized thus reducing the communication distances of those important sonobuoys. Moreover, in the proposed strategies, the weight of each sonobuoy and the α value are iteratively updated, which can progressively allow the UAV to fly more closely to those important sonobuoys to collect more effective data, thus significantly expediting the detecting process. Extensive simulation results have demonstrated the effectiveness of our proposed strategy, in that, compared with the benchmark strategies, it can detect underwater objects faster and more accurately.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=10172312,IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology,2023
Cyber-Physical System-Based Path Tracking Control of Autonomous Vehicles Under Cyber-Attacks,"As one of the typical applications of cyberphysical system (CPS), autonomous vehicles (AVs) are vulnerable to malicious disturbance from cyberattacks while tracking the desired path. This article focuses on CPS-based path tracking control problem of AVs under cyberattacks. First, the nonlinear state and measurement equations of AVs under cyberattacks are established based on vehicle dynamics model. Second, to improve the robustness of AVs against cyberattacks, sensor redundancy is introduced. A cyberattack detection method is designed by using extended Kalman filter, and the computational complexity of the cyberattack detection method is analyzed. In addition, sensor switching rules are developed to isolate the disturbance of cyberattacks. Then, the control problem of the AVs is formulated based on model predictive control. Input-to-state stability of the control system under cyberattacks is established, and a link between the tolerable attack intensity and the detection thresholds is clearly revealed. Finally, the simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed control strategy.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9889204,IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics,2023
A Mathematical Modeling of Stuxnet-Style Autonomous Vehicle Malware,"Autonomous vehicles (AVs) have the potential to provide new paradigms to enhance the safety, mobility, and environmental sustainability of surface transportation. However, as vehicles become more computerized and internally interconnected by electronic control systems, their vulnerability to cyber-attacks is a fast-growing concern and a national priority. Evidence from the Internet virus suggests that AVs will have critical challenges posed by epidemic-style malware like Stuxnet. This self-propagating malware is a fast and powerful way of disrupting the AV system and transportation infrastructure. This study presents a mathematical model for Stuxnet-style malware’s temporal and spatial spread. Taking cues from the field of epidemiology and ecology, the malware will be described as an infectious epidemic to capture the dynamics of temporal and spatial propagation behavior. This study is the first attempt to analyze the spread of Stuxnet-style malware on AVs. The future uses of such a model for the temporal-geographic spread of AVs-based infectious malware are discussed.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9998460,IEEE Transactions on Intelligent Transportation Systems,2023
MTANet: Multitask-Aware Network With Hierarchical Multimodal Fusion for RGB-T Urban Scene Understanding,"Understanding urban scenes is a fundamental ability requirement for assisted driving and autonomous vehicles. Most of the available urban scene understanding methods use red-green-blue (RGB) images; however, their segmentation performances are prone to degradation under adverse lighting conditions. Recently, many effective artificial neural networks have been presented for urban scene understanding and have shown that incorporating RGB and thermal (RGB-T) images can improve segmentation accuracy even under unsatisfactory lighting conditions. However, the potential of multimodal feature fusion has not been fully exploited because operations such as simply concatenating the RGB and thermal features or averaging their maps have been adopted. To improve the fusion of multimodal features and the segmentation accuracy, we propose a multitask-aware network (MTANet) with hierarchical multimodal fusion (multiscale fusion strategy) for RGB-T urban scene understanding. We developed a hierarchical multimodal fusion module to enhance feature fusion and built a high-level semantic module to extract semantic information for merging with coarse features at various abstraction levels. Using the multilevel fusion module, we exploited low-, mid-, and high-level fusion to improve segmentation accuracy. The multitask module uses boundary, binary, and semantic supervision to optimize the MTANet parameters. Extensive experiments were performed on two benchmark RGB-T datasets to verify the improved performance of the proposed MTANet compared with state-of-the-art methods.1",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9749834,IEEE Transactions on Intelligent Vehicles,2023
AoI-Aware Resource Allocation for Platoon-Based C-V2X Networks via Multi-Agent Multi-Task Reinforcement Learning,"This paper investigates the problem of age of information (AoI) aware radio resource management for a platooning system. Multiple autonomous platoons exploit the cellular wireless vehicle-to-everything (C-V2X) communication technology to disseminate the cooperative awareness messages (CAMs) to their followers while ensuring timely delivery of safety-critical messages to the Road-Side Unit (RSU). To lower the computational load at the RSU and cope with the challenges of dynamic channel conditions, we exploit a distributed resource allocation framework based on multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL), where each platoon leader (PL) acts as an agent and interacts with the environment to learn its optimal policy. Motivated by the existing literature in RL, we propose two novel MARL frameworks based on the multi-agent deep deterministic policy gradient (MADDPG), named Modified MADDPG, and Modified MADDPG with task decomposition. Both algorithms train two critics with the following goals: A global critic which estimates the global expected reward and motivates the agents toward a cooperating behavior and an exclusive local critic for each agent that estimates the local individual reward. Furthermore, based on the tasks each agent has to accomplish, in the second algorithm, the holistic individual reward of each agent is decomposed into multiple sub-reward functions where task-wise value functions are learned separately. Numerical results indicate our proposed algorithms' effectiveness compared with other contemporary RL frameworks, e.g., federated reinforcement learning (FRL) in terms of AoI performance and CAM message transmission probability.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=10077432,IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology,2023
Dynamic Scenario Representation Learning for Motion Forecasting With Heterogeneous Graph Convolutional Recurrent Networks,"Due to the complex and changing interactions in dynamic scenarios, motion forecasting is a challenging problem in autonomous driving. Most existing works exploit static road graphs to characterize scenarios and are limited in modeling evolving spatio-temporal dependencies in dynamic scenarios. In this letter, we resort to dynamic heterogeneous graphs to model the scenario. Various scenario components including vehicles (agents) and lanes, multi-type interactions, and their changes over time are jointly encoded. Furthermore, we design a novel heterogeneous graph convolutional recurrent network, aggregating diverse interaction information and capturing their evolution, to learn to exploit intrinsic spatio-temporal dependencies in dynamic graphs and obtain effective representations of dynamic scenarios. Finally, with a motion forecasting decoder, our model predicts realistic and multi-modal future trajectories of agents and outperforms state-of-the-art published works on several motion forecasting benchmarks.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=10081482,IEEE Robotics and Automation Letters,2023
Underwater Equipotential Line Tracking Based on Self-Attention Embedded Multiagent Reinforcement Learning Toward AUV-Based ITS,"The rapid development of intelligent underwater devices promotes marine exploitation activities, including marine resource exploitation, marine target tracking, etc. This work will present how to utilize the Autonomous Underwater Vehicle (AUV) swarm or multi-AUVs system to track the underwater diffusion pollution, especially the equipotential line of particular concentration. Different from most of the current research, in this work, we take the AUV swam as a network system and utilize the Software-Defined Networking (SDN) technique to optimize the network architecture, constructing an SDN-enabled AUV network Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS). With the centralized management ability of the SDN technique, we propose the software-defined Centralized Training Decentralized Execution (CTDE) architecture based on the graph-based Soft Actor-Critic (SAC) algorithm to optimize the system control and management. To improve the computing and training efficiency, we embed the self-attention mechanism into the critic network construction, leading to a self-attention-based SAC algorithm. Evaluation results demonstrate that our proposed approach is able to exactly track the equipotential lines of a particular concentration in many categories (with different types of equipotential lines (including the shape, noise, and diffusion value)) of underwater diffusion fields. Meanwhile, our proposed approaches outperform some classical schemes in system awards, tracking errors, etc.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9874992,IEEE Transactions on Intelligent Transportation Systems,2023
GNSS Spoofer Localization for Vehicles Based on Doppler and Clock Drift Double Difference,"With the development of vehicle navigation, autonomous driving and unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV), increasing spoofing attacks of global navigation satellite systems (GNSS) have emerged towards vehicles, which can mislead users by false position, velocity and time (PVT) solutions, resulting in serious consequences. Spoofer localization is a necessary step to fundamentally address the spoofing attacks. Most of the conventional spoofer localization methods are based on time of arrival (TOA) or time difference of arrival (TDOA), where time synchronization is indispensable and therefore is hard to apply to the existing vehicles equipped with independent commercial receivers. To cope with this problem, in this paper we develop a flexible method for vehicles to locate a stationary spoofer based on Doppler and clock drift double difference (DCDD). DCDD is calculated using Doppler measurements and clock drift solutions of one vehicular receiver and another reference receiver. Generally, Doppler frequency of GNSS signals changes slowly with time, which releases the restriction for high-precision time synchronization. DCDD represents the Doppler frequency caused by the vehicle motion, from which the spoofer position can be estimated. Utilizing DCDD, an iterative weighted least squares (WLS) algorithm is used to solve the spoofer position, and a closed-form initial value is given to improve the convergence rate. We evaluate the localization performance by the derived Cramér-Rao lower bound (CRLB) in the presence of vehicle position and velocity errors. Simulations and field vehicle experiments are conducted to verify the feasibility and effective of the proposed method.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9969943,IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology,2023
Towards UAV-Based MEC Service Chain Resilience Evaluation: A Quantitative Modeling Approach,"Unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) and network function virtualization (NFV) facilitate the deployment of multi-access edge computing (MEC). In the UAV-based MEC (UMEC) network, virtualized network function (VNF) can be implemented as a lightweight container running on UMEC host operating system (OS). However, UMEC network is vulnerable to attack, which can result in resource degradation and even UMEC service disruption. Rejuvenation techniques, such as failover technique and live container migration technique, can mitigate the impact of resource degradation but their effectiveness to improve the resilience of UMEC services should be evaluated. This paper presents a quantitative modeling approach based on semi-Markov process to investigate the resilience of a UMEC service chain consisting of any number of VNFs executed in any number of UMEC hosts in terms of availability and reliability. Unlike existing studies, the semi-Markov model constructed in this paper can capture the time-dependent behaviors between VNFs, between host OSes, and between VNFs and host OSes on the condition that the holding times of the recovery and failure events follow any kind of distribution. We perform the sensitivity analysis to identify potential resilience bottlenecks. The results highlight that migration time is the parameter significantly affecting the resilience, which shed the insight on designing the UMEC service chain with high-grade resilience requirements. In addition, we carry out the numerical experiments to reveal that: (i) the type of failure time distribution has a significant effect on the resilience; and (ii) the resilience increases with decreasing number of VNFs, while the availability increases with increasing number of UMEC hosts and the reliability decreases with increasing number of UMEC hosts, which can provide meaningful guidance for the UAV placement optimization in the UMEC network.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=10039493,IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology,2023
A Comparative Analysis of Deadlock Avoidance and Prevention Algorithms for Resource Provisioning in Intelligent Autonomous Transport Systems Over 6G Infrastructure,"6G is the future of intelligent connectivity artefacts with Artificial Intelligence (AI) at its backbone. The Multi-Access Edge Computing (MEC) based 6G enabled infrastructure helps in achieving the required zero latency for autonomous Intelligent Transport Systems (ITS) with features of low power consumption, lower end-to-end latency, minimal processing/transmission overheads, higher throughput and reliability. MEC are prone to a deadlock due to the limited amount of available computational resources, resulting in fatal delays in Vehicle-to-Vehicle (V2V), Vehicles to Road Side Unit (RSU) and RSU to ITS communication. The unresolved deadlock may entail higher energy consumption that can adversely affect the Quality of Service (QoS) in terms of safety and reliability with potential threats of causing fatal accidents. Therefore, it is almost imperative to resolve the deadlocks from MEC to comply with the QoS parameters of MEC based autonomous vehicles. The asserted goals can be achieved by employing an intelligent and adaptive deadlock resolution strategy. In this paper, a deadlock-aware, and collaborative edge decision algorithm has been proposed for facilitating the seamless communication of autonomous vehicles over MEC. Additionally, deadlock avoidance and prevention schemes have been evaluated using Bankers resource request avoidance algorithm, wound wait algorithm and wait-die algorithms for resource provisioning in collaborative MEC. Furthermore, the effectiveness of deadlock avoidance and prevention algorithms in real-time scenarios has been analyzed in MEC systems. The metrics used for a comparative analysis in this research include Round-trip time, Queue wait-time and CPU utilization. The proposed algorithm shows promising results when compared with prevalent techniques.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9777253,IEEE Transactions on Intelligent Transportation Systems,2023
Aerial Surveillance in Cities: When UAVs Take Public Transportation Vehicles,"This paper considers using unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) to survey important sites across a city. When the sites are relatively far from the UAVs’ depot, the UAVs may not be able to reach many of the sites. Suppose that a UAV can take public transportation vehicles (PTVs) like a passenger. Then, it may reach a site that is unreachable by flying only. Based on this UAV-PTV scheme, we investigate a task-UAV assignment problem, which assigns a set of surveillance tasks to UAVs. We formulate a mixed-integer linear programming (MILP) problem that minimizes the overall energy consumption of UAVs, subject to that every site is surveyed by a certain number of UAVs during a given time window, and all UAVs successfully return to the depot. Considering that this problem is NP-hard, we present two sub-optimal solutions. The first solution orders the surveillance tasks according to the starting times of their time windows. Then, starting from the earliest one, it assigns the tasks one by one to UAVs. The second solution breaks the tasks into small non-overlapping groups. It then assigns tasks to UAVs group by group. The former solution quickly addresses the assignment problem, but it lacks the overall management of UAV resources. The latter improves this by assigning a group of tasks simultaneously, and it can control the computation complexity by limiting the group size. The comparison with the brute force method shows that the proposed solutions can achieve competitive performance in a reasonable time. Note to Practitioners—Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) have been widely used in surveillance missions. However, one challenge practitioners often meet is the limited flight duration. Commercial UAVs are in general powered by the onboard battery. Due to the restriction of payload, the battery capacity is constrained, which limits the UAVs’ operation time. In this paper, we present the approach exploiting public transportation vehicles (PTVs). In our design, a UAV can take a public transportation vehicles such as buses, trams and trains on the roof and transfer between vehicles when necessary. With this UAV-PTV collaboration scheme, we consider how to efficiently assign surveillance tasks to UAVs. Due to the NP-hardness of the considered problem, two suboptimal algorithms are presented.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9797309,IEEE Transactions on Automation Science and Engineering,2023
PCPNet: An Efficient and Semantic-Enhanced Transformer Network for Point Cloud Prediction,"The ability to predict future structure features of environments based on past perception information is extremely needed by autonomous vehicles, which helps to make the following decision-making and path planning more reasonable.

In this letter, we propose a novel efficient Transformer-based network to predict the future LiDAR point clouds exploiting the past point cloud sequences. We also design a semantic auxiliary training strategy to make the predicted LiDAR point cloud sequence semantically similar to the ground truth and thus improves the significance of the deployment for more tasks in real-vehicle applications. Our approach is completely self-supervised, which means it does not require any manual labeling and has a solid generalization ability toward different environments. The experimental results show that our method outperforms the state-of-the-art PCP methods on the prediction results and semantic similarity, and has a good real-time performance.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=10141631,IEEE Robotics and Automation Letters,2023
Optimizing Vehicle Re-Ordering Events in Coordinated Autonomous Intersection Crossings Under CAVs' Location Uncertainty,"Road intersections represent the primary bottleneck in transportation systems and connected autonomous vehicles (CAVs) have the potential to aleviate the problem through communication and coordination. As such, this work proposes a novel framework where, accounting for CAVs' location uncertainty, an intersection manager (IM) controls CAVs approaching a road crossing so as to maximize the number of admitted vehicles, while ensuring a guaranteed (tunable) level of safety. To fully exploit the communication links among the IM and the CAVs, several features are included in the proposed framework: (i) periodic re-optimizations of the CAVs' applied controls; (ii) periodic re-ordering of the intersection crossing sequence; and (iii) event-based control and ordering optimizations to achieve the best possible trade-off between complexity and performance. The proposed framework is able to improve both the number of admitted CAVs to the intersection and the CAVs' average speeds as compared to relevant state-of-the-art solutions. Importantly, when event-triggering is applied, most of the benefits introduced by periodic optimizations are retained, while at the same time the number of re-optimizations required are reduced by 47.6% (34.18%) during average (heavy) traffic conditions.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9976239,IEEE Transactions on Intelligent Vehicles,2023
AI-Empowered Speed Extraction via Port-Like Videos for Vehicular Trajectory Analysis,"Automated container terminal (ACT) is considered as port industry development direction, and accurate kinematic data (speed, volume, etc.) is essential for enhancing ACT operation efficiency and safety. Port surveillance videos provide much useful spatial-temporal information with advantages of easy obtainable, large spatial coverage, etc. In that way, it is of great importance to analyze automated guided vehicle (AGV) trajectory movement from port surveillance videos. Motivated by the newly emerging computer vision and artificial intelligence (AI) techniques, we propose an ensemble framework for extracting vehicle speeds from port-like surveillance videos for the purpose of analyzing AGV moving trajectory. Firstly, the framework exploits vehicle position in each image via a feature-enhanced scale-aware descriptor. Secondly, we match vehicle position and trajectory data from the previous step output via Kalman filter and Hungarian algorithm, and thus we obtain the vehicular imaging trajectory in a frame-by-frame manner. Thirdly, we estimate the vehicular moving speed in real-world via the help of perspective projection theory. The experimental results suggest that our proposed framework can obtain accurate vehicle kinematic data under typical port traffic scenarios considering that the average measurement error of root mean square deviation is 0.675 km/h, the mean absolute deviation is 0.542 km/h, and the Pearson correlation coefficient is 0.9349. The research findings suggest that cutting-edge AI and computer vision techniques can accurately extract on-site vehicular trajectory related data from port videos, and thus help port traffic participants make more reasonable management decisions.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9764667,IEEE Transactions on Intelligent Transportation Systems,2023
Application of Graph Learning With Multivariate Relational Representation Matrix in Vehicular Social Networks,"The essence of connection in vehicle network is the social relationship between people, and thus Vehicular Social Networks (VSNs), characterized by social aspects and features, can be formed. The information collected by VSNs can be used for context prediction of autonomous vehicles. Multivariate relations are common in square connected relations caused by geographic characteristics in VSNs. They can effectively reflect the high-order structural features of the network dataset. It is necessary to exploit the multivariate relations of VSNs to improve the performance of context prediction. However, The representation of entity-relationes in the network often adopts a binary form, and the existing graph learning methods rely on the neighborhood information of nodes to achieve the aggregation or diffusion of information. Using this to represent multivariate relations will result in partial omissions or even complete loss of valuable information, which ultimately affects the learning effect of learning methods. In order to better understand the social behavior of the VSNs, this paper uses the network motif to implement the representation of the multivariate relations in the network, and proposes the graPh learnIng with moTif mAtrix (PITA) method. This method can be used as a preprocessing step for the measurement strategy of the relations in VSNs and the graph learning, which can mine the information in VSNs and improve the accuracy of the original graph learning method by the multivariate relation information. We performed experiments on 6 network datasets. The experimental results show that in the node classification task, the baseline method modified by the PITA method has a higher classification accuracy than the original method.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9966312,IEEE Transactions on Intelligent Transportation Systems,2023
Neural-Network-Based Fuzzy Observer With Data-Driven Uncertainty Identification for Vehicle Dynamics Estimation Under Extreme Driving Conditions: Theory and Experimental Results,"We present a neural network based Takagi-Sugeno (TS) fuzzy observer to estimate the lateral speed (or sideslip angle) of nonlinear vehicle dynamics subject to modeling uncertainties and unknown inputs. To this end, we first propose a TS fuzzy reduced-order observer design, which can be implemented with low computation effort, for nonlinear systems. The stability and robustness of the observer scheme against the modeling uncertainty is guaranteed by the $\mathscr {H}_{\infty }$ filtering method. A data-driven approach is proposed to construct feedforward neural networks (NNs) for uncertainty approximation. This data-driven approach exploits a specific sliding mode observer (SMO) to identify the model uncertainty data from the collected training data. The NN-based uncertainty approximation is incorporated into the TS fuzzy observer structure to mitigate the effect of uncertainty and improve the estimation quality. Via Lyapunov's stability theory, design conditions of both the TS fuzzy reduced-order observer for dynamics estimation and the SMO for uncertainty identification are derived in terms of linear matrix inequalities. Experimental results obtained with the INSA autonomous vehicle on a real test track demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed TS fuzzy observer under various driving scenarios. Performance comparisons are also performed to illustrate the interest of using NN-based uncertainty approximation for the new reduced-order observer scheme, especially under extreme driving conditions.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=10054430,IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology,2023
Mobility-Aware Multi-Hop Task Offloading for Autonomous Driving in Vehicular Edge Computing and Networks,"Vehicular Edge Computing (VEC) has gained increasing interest due to its potential to provide low latency and reduce the load in backhaul networks. In order to meet drastically increasing computation demands from emerging ever-growing vehicular applications, e.g., autonomous driving, abundant computation resources of individual vehicles can play a crucial role in task execution in a VEC scenario, that can further contribute in considerably improving user experience. This is however an extremely challenging task due to high mobility of vehicles that can easily lead to intermittent connectivity, thereby disrupting on-going task processing. In this paper, we propose a task offloading scheme by exploiting multi-hop vehicle computation resources in VEC based on mobility analysis of vehicles. In addition to the vehicles within one hop from the task vehicle that generates computation tasks, certain multi-hop vehicles that meet the given requirements in terms of link connectivity and computation capacity, are also leveraged to carry out the tasks offloaded by the task vehicle. An optimization problem is formulated for the task vehicle to minimize the weighted sum of execution time and computation cost of all tasks. A semidefinite relaxation approach with an adaptive adjustment procedure is proposed to solve the formulated optimization problem for obtaining the corresponding offloading decisions. The simulation results show that our proposed offloading scheme can achieve significant improvement in terms of response delay by at least 34% compared with the other algorithms (e.g., local processing and random offloading).",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9686591,IEEE Transactions on Intelligent Transportation Systems,2023
Detecting UAV Presence Using Convolution Feature Vectors in Light Gradient Boosting Machine,"The growing number of Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) applications brings with it, a rising number of privacy concerns. The high availability of commercial drones is also increasing the need for strict regulations. As far away as we are from establishing such protocols to ensure that the most basic human right to privacy is not exploited, we are further away from enforcing them. Thus, there is a need for a generalised drone detection system to detect different drones operating in a broad range of Radio Frequencies (RF). Previous attempts to tackle this problem have been made using audio, video, radar, WiFi and RF signals. While all these methods have their own benefits and drawbacks, RF has various characteristics which make them suitable for practical applications on a large scale. In this paper, we propose a novel technique called the ConvLGBM model which combines the feature extraction capability of a Convolution Neural Network (CNN) with the high classification accuracy of the Light Gradient Boosting Machine (LightGBM).

In this paper, we develop a reconfigurable wireless relaying system aided by multiple unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV)-carried intelligent reflecting surfaces (IRSs), where both the significant active and passive beamforming gain brought by base station (BS) and IRS and the flexibility of UAV is exploited to enhance multiuser downlink transmission. Specifically, we jointly optimize UAVs' placement, active beamforming and power allocation at the BS, and passive beamforming at the UAV-IRSs to maximize the weighted sum rate. To address the corresponding optimization problem, we decompose it into several subproblems, which are iteratively optimized. Based on simulation results, the proposed scheme achieves significant performance gains over the benchmark schemes.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9976271,IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology,2023
Ultra-Reliable Device-Centric Uplink Communications in Airborne Networks: A Spatiotemporal Analysis,"This article proposes an ultra-reliable device-centric uplink (URDC-UL) communication scheme for airborne networks. In particular, base stations (BSs) are mounted on unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) that travel to schedule UL transmissions and collect data from devices. To attain an ultra-reliable unified device-centric performance, the UL connection is established when the UAV-BS is hovering at the nearest possible distance from the scheduled device. The performance of the proposed URDC-UL scheme is benchmarked against a stationary UAV-centric uplink (SUC-UL) scheme where the devices are scheduled to communicate to UAV-BSs that are continuously hovering at static locations. Utilizing stochastic geometry and queueing theory, novel spatiotemporal mathematical models are developed, which account for the UAV-BS spatial densities, mobility, altitude, antenna directivity, ground-to-air channel, and temporal traffic, among other factors. The results demonstrate the sensitivity of the URDC-UL scheme to the ratio between hovering and traveling time. In particular, the hovering to traveling time ratio should be carefully adjusted to maximize the harvested performance gains for the URDC-UL scheme in terms of link reliability, transmission rate, energy efficiency, and delay. Exploiting the URDC-UL scheme allows IoT devices to minimize transmission power while maintaining unified reliable transmission. This preserves the device's battery and addresses a critical IoT design challenge.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=10057032,IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology,2023
Power Allocation for Uplink Communications of Massive Cellular-Connected UAVs,"Cellular-connected unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) has attracted a surge of research interest in both academia and industry. To support aerial user equipment (UEs) in the existing cellular networks, one promising approach is to assign a portion of the system bandwidth exclusively to the UAV-UEs. This is especially favorable for use cases where a large number of UAV-UEs are exploited, e.g., for package delivery close to a warehouse. Although the nearly line-of-sight (LoS) channels can result in higher powers received, UAVs can in turn cause severe interference to each other in the same frequency band. In this contribution, we focus on the uplink communications of massive cellular-connected UAVs. Different power allocation algorithms are proposed to either maximize the minimal spectrum efficiency (SE) or maximize the overall SE to cope with the severe interference based on the successive convex approximation (SCA) principle. One of the challenges is that a UAV can affect a large area meaning that many more UAV-UEs must be considered in the optimization problem, which is essentially different from that for terrestrial UEs. The necessity of single-carrier uplink transmission further complicates the problem. Nevertheless, we find that the special property of large coherent bandwidths and coherent times of the propagation channels can be leveraged. The performances of the proposed algorithms are evaluated via extensive simulations in the full-buffer transmission mode and bursty-traffic mode. Results show that the proposed algorithms can effectively enhance the uplink SEs. This work can be considered the first attempt to deal with the interference among massive cellular-connected UAV-UEs with optimized power allocations.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=10043743,IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology,2023
Jamming-Enhanced Secure UAV Communications With Propulsion Energy and Curvature Radius Constraints,"A multi-unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs)-aided secure communication network is studied, where multiple information UAVs carrying temporary aerial base stations transmit confidential information to multiple authorized receivers (ARs), and a jammer UAV is employed to send artificial noise to multiple unauthorized receivers (URs) for mitigating information leakage. Some practical constrains including the inter-UAV interference among the information UAVs and the jammer UAV, the maximal available propulsion energy at UAVs, and the curvature radius limitations of UAVs' trajectories are concurrently taken into account. In order to maximize the minimum secrecy rate among the ARs, the AR scheduling, the UAVs' power allocation and the trajectories of UAVs are jointly optimized by formulating a multi-variable optimization problem. To solve the non-convex problem efficiently, we present a block coordinate descent (BCD)-based approach, where the penalty dual decomposition (PDD)-based algorithm is designed to optimize the AR scheduling, and successive convex approximation (SCA)-based algorithm is proposed to optimize the UAVs' power allocation and the trajectories of UAVs. The complexity of the presented BCD-based approach is analyzed, which achieves polynomial complexity. Simulation results show that imposing curvature radius limitations on the UAVs' trajectory design is effective to avoid sharp turning of UAVs. Moreover, as curvature radius increases, the system max-min secrecy rate decreases. Besides, the secrecy rate performance of the system can be enhanced by exploiting one jammer UAV to interfere with the URs.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=10083325,IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology,2023
Dynamic Object Classification of Low-Resolution Point Clouds: An LSTM-Based Ensemble Learning Approach,"In unmanned vehicle perception, dynamic object classification is applied to classify objects accurately and timely, providing decision-making for obstacle avoidance and planning. Low-resolution LiDAR is one of the most important sensors for this task. Unfortunately, the existing approaches perform unsatisfactorily due to the huge domain gap between low-resolution and high-resolution point cloud classification. Some schemes try to reduce the gap by fusing multi-scan information through SLAM or completing single-scan point clouds. However, these methods rely on high positioning accuracy or the wholeness of object data. To this end, differently, we propose a dynamic object classification method of low-resolution data from the perspective of time-series fusion. By modeling time series of sparse data, we indicate change rules of separate classification models for object representation. Subsequently, based on ensemble learning, our method performs feature-level fusion on multiple networks to exploit their different expression capabilities. Finally, we utilize long short-term memory to gradually classify dynamic objects. Besides, we also propose a dataset of the low-resolution point clouds and manually annotate the ground truth, which contains abundant samples of cars, pedestrians, and motorcycles. Through testing actual low-resolution data, the accuracy of our method is verified to improve a lot than the state-of-the-art approaches.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=10286119,IEEE Robotics and Automation Letters,2023
Jamming the Relay-Assisted Multi-User Wireless Communication System: A Zero-Sum Game Approach,"Recently, various wireless Internet-of-Things devices and unmanned aerial vehicles have been frequently used to facilitate daily life. On the other hand, they can also pose serious threats to public security if maliciously used. A countermeasure against these threats is to transmit jamming signals to break the communication links between attacker and wireless devices. However, this is not easy since modern multi-device (multi-user) wireless communication systems are smart in avoiding jamming. Moreover, a relay is widely used to improve the jamming resistance. To successfully jam those malicious devices, we consider a jamming and anti-jamming zero-sum game, in which the attacker tries to maximize the sum-rate of a relay-assisted wireless system and the jammer tries to minimize it. Finding the equilibrium is challenging due to its non-convexity and complex structure. We address this problem in two cases. Specifically, in the single-device (single-user) case, we show that putting the whole jamming power to either relay or device achieves the Nash equilibrium. In the multi-device case, an efficient method is developed, which transforms this game into a min-max optimization problem and decouples it into two sub-problems by the hybrid block successive approximation method. The resultant sub-problems are solved by the multi-block alternating direction method of multipliers and the block successive upper-bound minimization method of multipliers, respectively. Then, a stationary point of the original problem can be iteratively achieved. Numerical results demonstrate that the two proposed jamming methods outperform many traditional methods.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=10128833,IEEE Transactions on Information Forensics and Security,2023
LSTM-Based Distributed Conditional Generative Adversarial Network for Data-Driven 5G-Enabled Maritime UAV Communications,"5G enabled maritime unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) communication is one of the important applications of 5G wireless network which requires minimum latency and higher reliability to support mission-critical applications. Therefore, lossless reliable communication with a high data rate is the key requirement in modern wireless communication systems. These all factors highly depend upon channel conditions. In this work, a channel model is proposed for air-to-surface link exploiting millimeter wave (mmWave) for 5G enabled maritime unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) communication. Firstly, we will present the formulated channel estimation method which directly aims to adopt channel state information (CSI) of mmWave from the channel model inculcated by UAV operating within the Long Short Term Memory (LSTM)-Distributed Conditional generative adversarial network (DCGAN) i.e. (LSTM-DCGAN) for each beamforming direction. Secondly, to enhance the applications for the proposed trained channel model for the spatial domain, we have designed an LSTM-DCGAN based UAV network, where each one will learn mmWave CSI for all the distributions. Lastly, we have categorized the most favorable LSTM-DCGAN training method and emanated certain conditions for our UAV network to increase the channel model learning rate. Simulation results have shown that the proposed LSTM-DCGAN based network is vigorous to the error generated through local training. A detailed comparison has been done with the other available state-of-the-art CGAN network architectures i.e. stand-alone CGAN (without CSI sharing), Simple CGAN (with CSI sharing), multi-discriminator CGAN, federated learning CGAN and DCGAN. Simulation results have shown that the proposed LSTM-DCGAN structure demonstrates higher accuracy during the learning process and attained more data rate for downlink transmission as compared to the previous state of artworks.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9830137,IEEE Transactions on Intelligent Transportation Systems,2023
MacFormer: Map-Agent Coupled Transformer for Real-Time and Robust Trajectory Prediction,"Predicting the future behavior of agents is a fundamental task in autonomous vehicle domains. Accurate prediction relies on comprehending the surrounding map, which significantly regularizes agent behaviors. However, existing methods have limitations in exploiting the map and exhibit a strong dependence on historical trajectories, which yield unsatisfactory prediction performance and robustness. Additionally, their heavy network architectures impede real-time applications. To tackle these problems, we propose Map-Agent Coupled Transformer (MacFormer) for real-time and robust trajectory prediction. Our framework explicitly incorporates map constraints into the network via two carefully designed modules named coupled map and reference extractor. A novel multi-task optimization strategy (MTOS) is presented to enhance learning of topology and rule constraints. We also devise bilateral query scheme in context fusion for a more efficient and lightweight network. We evaluated our approach on Argoverse 1, Argoverse 2, and nuScenes real-world benchmarks, where it all achieved state-of-the-art performance with the lowest inference latency and smallest model size. Experiments also demonstrate that our framework is resilient to imperfect tracklet inputs. Furthermore, we show that by combining with our proposed strategies, classical models outperform their baselines, further validating the versatility of our framework.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=10238733,IEEE Robotics and Automation Letters,2023
A Non-Optimization-Based Dynamic Path Planning for Autonomous Obstacle Avoidance,"This article presents a non-optimization-based framework for path planning and tracking for evasive maneuvers in autonomous cars. The framework exploits a two-layer approach where a path planner generates a reference trajectory that is then tracked by a path-tracking controller. A nested curvature preview controller (CPC) implements path tracking. In this article, we show how to describe the closed-loop performance of the controller. The quantification of the closed-loop performance in the frequency domain guides the generation of the evasive path. In this way, the algorithm generates a path that avoids the obstacle (if possible) accounting for both static and dynamic constraints. The proposed framework, thus, provides a non-optimization-based way to integrate the characteristics of the path tracker in the path-planner algorithm, thus avoiding the need to define cost functions and use the third-party optimizers. This article validates the proposed evasive maneuver strategy in simulation and on an instrumented vehicle. First, we test the trajectory tracker, showing that it tracks aggressive trajectories (with a lateral acceleration close to 1 g) with an error smaller than 30 cm. Subsequently, we integrate the curvature preview with the path generator and show the joint generation-tracking performance in two different scenarios.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9867928,IEEE Transactions on Control Systems Technology,2023
SeqOT: A Spatial–Temporal Transformer Network for Place Recognition Using Sequential LiDAR Data,"Place recognition is an important component for autonomous vehicles to achieve loop closing or global localization. In this article, we tackle the problem of place recognition based on sequential 3-D LiDAR scans obtained by an onboard LiDAR sensor. We propose a transformer-based network named SeqOT to exploit the temporal and spatial information provided by sequential range images generated from the LiDAR data. It uses multiscale transformers to generate a global descriptor for each sequence of LiDAR range images in an end-to-end fashion. During online operation, our SeqOT finds similar places by matching such descriptors between the current query sequence and those stored in the map. We evaluate our approach on four datasets collected with different types of LiDAR sensors in different environments. The experimental results show that our method outperforms the state-of-the-art LiDAR-based place recognition methods and generalizes well across different environments. Furthermore, our method operates online faster than the frame rate of the sensor.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9994714,IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics,2023
Smart Underwater Pollution Detection Based on Graph-Based Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning Towards AUV-Based Network ITS,"The exploitation/utilization of marine resources and the rapid development of urbanization along coastal cities result in serious marine pollution, especially underwater diffusion pollution. It is a non-trivial task to detect the source of diffusion pollution, such that the disadvantageous effect of the pollution can be reduced. With the vision of 6G framework, we employ Autonomous Underwater Vehicle (AUV) flock and introduce the concept of AUV-based network. In particular, we utilize the Software-Defined Networking (SDN) technique to update the controllability of the AUV-based network, leading to the paradigm of SDN-enabled multi-AUVs network Intelligent Transportation Systems (SDNA-ITS). For SDNA-ITS, we utilize artificial potential field theories to model the control model. To optimize the system output, we introduce the graph-based Soft Actor-Critic (SAC) algorithm, i.e., a category of Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL) mechanism where each AUV can be regarded as a node in a graph. In particular, we improve the optimization model based on Centralized Training Decentralized Execution (CTDE) architecture with the assistance of the SDN controller, by which each AUV can efficiently adjust its speed towards the diffusion source. Further, to achieve exact path planning for detecting the diffusion source, a dynamic detection scheme is proposed to output the united control policy to schedule the SDNA-ITS dynamically. Simulation results demonstrate that our approaches are available to detect the underwater diffusion source when the actual scenario is taken into account and perform better than some recent research products.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9750063,IEEE Transactions on Intelligent Transportation Systems,2023
Graph Neural Networks for Intelligent Transportation Systems: A Survey,"Graph neural networks (GNNs) have been extensively used in a wide variety of domains in recent years. Owing to their power in analyzing graph-structured data, they have become broadly popular in intelligent transportation systems (ITS) applications as well. Despite their widespread applications in different transportation domains, there is no comprehensive review of recent advancements and future research directions that covers all transportation areas. Accordingly, in this survey, for the first time, we provide an overview of GNN studies in the general domain of ITS. Unlike previous surveys, which have been limited to traffic forecasting problems, we explore how GNN frameworks have evolved for different ITS applications, including traffic forecasting, demand prediction, autonomous vehicles, intersection management, parking management, urban planning, and transportation safety. Also, we micro-categorize the studies based on their transportation application to identify domain-specific research directions, opportunities, and challenges, which have been missing in previous surveys. Moreover, we identify unique and undiscussed research opportunities and directions, which is the result of reviewing a wide range of transportation applications. The neglected role of edge and graph learning in ITS applications, developing multi-modal models, and exploiting the power of unsupervised and reinforcement learning methods for developing more powerful GNNs are some examples of such new discussions in this survey. Finally, we have identified popular baseline models and datasets in each transportation domain, which facilitate the development and evaluation of future GNN-based frameworks.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=10077454,IEEE Transactions on Intelligent Transportation Systems,2023
Gaussian Radar Transformer for Semantic Segmentation in Noisy Radar Data,"Scene understanding is crucial for autonomous robots in dynamic environments for making future state predictions, avoiding collisions, and path planning. Camera and LiDAR perception made tremendous progress in recent years, but face limitations under adverse weather conditions. To leverage the full potential of multi-modal sensor suites, radar sensors are essential for safety critical tasks and are already installed in most new vehicles today. In this letter, we address the problem of semantic segmentation of moving objects in radar point clouds to enhance the perception of the environment with another sensor modality. Instead of aggregating multiple scans to densify the point clouds, we propose a novel approach based on the self-attention mechanism to accurately perform sparse, single-scan segmentation. Our approach, called Gaussian Radar Transformer, includes the newly introduced Gaussian transformer layer, which replaces the softmax normalization by a Gaussian function to decouple the contribution of individual points. To tackle the challenge of the transformer to capture long-range dependencies, we propose our attentive up- and downsampling modules to enlarge the receptive field and capture strong spatial relations. We compare our approach to other state-of-the-art methods on the RadarScenes data set and show superior segmentation quality in diverse environments, even without exploiting temporal information.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9968089,IEEE Robotics and Automation Letters,2023
PIT: Progressive Interaction Transformer for Pedestrian Crossing Intention Prediction,"For autonomous driving, one of the major challenges is to predict pedestrian crossing intention in ego-view. Pedestrian intention depends not only on their intrinsic goals but also on the stimulation of surrounding traffic elements. Considering the influence of other traffic elements on pedestrian intention, recent work introduced more traffic element information into the model to successfully improve performance. However, it is still difficult to effectively capture and fully exploit the potential dynamic spatio-temporal interactions among the target pedestrian and its surrounding traffic elements for accurate reasoning. In this work, inspired by neuroscience that human drivers tend to make continuous sensory-motor driving decisions by progressive visual stimulation, we propose a model termed Progressive Interaction Transformer (PIT) for pedestrian crossing intention prediction. Local pedestrian, global environment, and ego-vehicle motion are considered simultaneously in the proposed PIT. In particular, the temporal fusion block and self-attention mechanism are introduced to jointly and progressively model the dynamic spatio-temporal interactions among the three parties, allowing it to capture richer information and make prediction in a similar way to human drivers. Experimental results demonstrate that PIT achieves higher performance compared with other state-of-the-arts and preserves real-time inference.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=10247098,IEEE Transactions on Intelligent Transportation Systems,2023
RDMNet: Reliable Dense Matching Based Point Cloud Registration for Autonomous Driving,"Point cloud registration is an important task in robotics and autonomous driving to estimate the ego-motion of the vehicle. Recent advances following the coarse-to-fine manner show promising potential in point cloud registration. However, existing methods rely on good superpoint correspondences, which are hard to be obtained reliably and efficiently, thus resulting in less robust and accurate point cloud registration. In this paper, we propose a novel network, named RDMNet, to find dense point correspondences coarse-to-fine and improve final pose estimation based on such reliable correspondences. Our RDMNet uses a devised 3D-RoFormer mechanism to first extract distinctive superpoints and generates reliable superpoints matches between two point clouds. The proposed 3D-RoFormer fuses 3D position information into the transformer network, efficiently exploiting point clouds’ contextual and geometric information to generate robust superpoint correspondences. RDMNet then propagates the sparse superpoints matches to dense point matches using the neighborhood information for accurate point cloud registration. We extensively evaluate our method on multiple datasets from different environments. The experimental results demonstrate that our method outperforms existing state-of-the-art approaches in all tested datasets with a strong generalization ability.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=10246847,IEEE Transactions on Intelligent Transportation Systems,2023
Fast Fixed-Time Output Multi-Formation Tracking of Networked Autonomous Surface Vehicles: A Mathematical Induction Method,"In this paper, we aim to exploit an effective way to solve the output multi-formation tracking problem of the networked autonomous surface vehicles (ASVs) in a fast fixed time manner. Specifically, addressing the output multi-formation tracking problem implies that 1) the networked ASVs are divided into multiple interconnected subnetworks with respect to multiple targets; 2) for each subnetwork, the outputs of the networked ASVs form a desired geometric formation with exchanging the local interactions. Besides, solving the fast fixed-time tracking problem in this paper implies that 1) the convergence time is independent of the initial conditions; 2) the system states are forced to reach the employed nonsingular fixed-time sliding surface in a prescribed time, which thus called fast fixed-time control. Then, based on a time-related function and a nonsingular fixed-time sliding surface, a hierarchical fast fixed-time control algorithm is proposed to solve the aforementioned problem within a fast fixed time being independent of the initial conditions. Furthermore, by employing the Lyapunov argument and mathematical induction, we present the sufficient conditions for fast fixed-time convergence of the tracking errors with respect to multiple targets. Finally, numerous simulation examples are presented to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed control algorithm.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=10005858,IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology,2023
User Selection and Codebook Design for NOMA-Based High Altitude Platform Station (HAPS) Communications,"High altitude platform station (HAPS) communications have made a tremendous impact on recent research into sixth-generation (6G) and beyond wireless networks. The large coverage area and significant computational capability of HAPS systems enable many areas of utilization in 6G and beyond applications, including Internet of Things (IoT) services, augmented reality, and connected autonomous vehicles. In addition, non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) is a cutting-edge technology that can be utilized to enhance spectral efficiency in HAPS systems. In this paper, we exploit NOMA-based HAPS communications and multiple antennas to meet the connectivity, reliability, and high-data-rate requirements of 6G and beyond applications. We propose a user selection and correlation-based user pairing algorithm for a NOMA-based multi-user HAPS system. Moreover, we investigate the codebook design for HAPS communication and adapt the polar-cap codebook (PCC) to the HAPS channel which shows Rician fading propagation characteristics dominated by the line-of-sight (LOS) component.

Convex Vision-Based Negative Obstacle Detection Framework for Autonomous Vehicles,"This study investigates the convex optimization frameworks for accurate and fast negative obstacle detection as well as depth estimations that are vital for real-time, superior autonomous vehicle operations. A convex framework is proposed in conjunction with a unique stereo perception approach to manage the complex nature of such invisible obstacles. The proposed stereo configuration incorporates an alignment that displaces the cameras along a vertical baseline to extract useful information pertaining to negative obstacle features for various illustrative terrain settings. The convex framework exploits these properties to evaluate depth jumps in the disparity space image and perform geometrical analysis of potential occlusion regions. The corresponding convex formulations are based on linear matrix inequalities to detect sudden disparity, angle profile, and intensity variations for potential negative obstacles and to estimate the internal depth of the detected obstacles. Experimental results demonstrate that consecutive processes can be structured in a convex framework to efficiently identify negative obstacle attributes at a range of distances for texture varying environments, providing a vital extension to real-time vehicular system implementations with superior detection rates.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9697383,IEEE Transactions on Intelligent Vehicles,2023
Long-Term Localization Using Semantic Cues in Floor Plan Maps,"Lifelong localization in a given map is an essential capability for autonomous service robots. In this letter, we consider the task of long-term localization in a changing indoor environment given sparse CAD floor plans. The commonly used pre-built maps from the robot sensors may increase the cost and time of deployment. Furthermore, their detailed nature requires that they are updated when significant changes occur. We address the difficulty of localization when the correspondence between the map and the observations is low due to the sparsity of the CAD map and the changing environment. To overcome both challenges, we propose to exploit semantic cues that are commonly present in human-oriented spaces. These semantic cues can be detected using RGB cameras by utilizing object detection, and are matched against an easy-to-update, abstract semantic map. The semantic information is integrated into a Monte Carlo localization framework using a particle filter that operates on 2D LiDAR scans and camera data. We provide a long-term localization solution and a semantic map format, for environments that undergo changes to their interior structure and detailed geometric maps are not available. We evaluate our localization framework on multiple challenging indoor scenarios in an office environment, taken weeks apart. The experiments suggest that our approach is robust to structural changes and can run on an onboard computer. We released the open source implementation of our approach written in C++ together with a ROS wrapper.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9956025,IEEE Robotics and Automation Letters,2023
RDA: An Accelerated Collision Free Motion Planner for Autonomous Navigation in Cluttered Environments,"Autonomous motion planning is challenging in multi-obstacle environments due to nonconvex collision avoidance constraints. Directly applying numerical solvers to these nonconvex formulations fails to exploit the constraint structures, resulting in excessive computation time. In this letter, we present an accelerated collision-free motion planner, namely regularized dual alternating direction method of multipliers (RDADMM or RDA for short), for the model predictive control (MPC) based motion planning problem. The proposed RDA addresses nonconvex motion planning via solving a smooth biconvex reformulation via duality and allows the collision avoidance constraints to be computed in parallel for each obstacle to reduce computation time significantly. We validate the performance of the RDA planner through path-tracking experiments with car-like robots in both simulation and real-world settings. Experimental results show that the proposed method generates smooth collision-free trajectories with less computation time compared with other benchmarks and performs robustly in cluttered environments.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=10036019,IEEE Robotics and Automation Letters,2023
Lightweight and Bilateral Controllable Data Sharing for Secure Autonomous Vehicles Platooning Service,"Autonomous vehicle platoons are emerging as a promising solution to modern urban governance challenges, such as traffic congestion, air pollution, and fuel waste. As a data-driven paradigm, ensuring secure data sharing is a key challenge for autonomous vehicle platoon applications. However, existing research on secure data sharing of autonomous vehicles platoon suffers from practical weaknesses such as privacy leakage, lack of flexible data source identification, and inefficiency. Motivated by that, this article first proposes the LFBA scheme, which is the first fine-grained data sharing framework that supports bilateral access control and access policy hiding with lightweight and almost constant computational and storage resources consumption, this can be owed to the sophisticated algorithm structure we designed. We then construct an edge-assisted deployment model over LFBA (EA-LFBA) to further improve efficiency and security against common attacks. We then provide the security proof for LFBA, and security analysis for EA-LFBA.

Lifelong Vehicle Trajectory Prediction Framework Based on Generative Replay,"Accurate trajectory prediction of vehicles is essential for reliable autonomous driving. To maintain consistent performance as a vehicle driving around different cities, it is crucial to adapt to changing traffic circumstances and achieve lifelong trajectory prediction model. To realize it, catastrophic forgetting is a main problem to be addressed. In this paper, a divergence measurement method based on conditional Kullback-Leibler divergence is proposed first to evaluate spatiotemporal dependency difference among varied driving circumstances. Then based on generative replay, a novel lifelong vehicle trajectory prediction framework is developed. The framework consists of a conditional generation model and a vehicle trajectory prediction model. The conditional generation model is a generative adversarial network conditioned on position configuration of vehicles. After learning and merging trajectory distribution of vehicles across different cities, the generation model replays trajectories with prior samplings as inputs, which alleviates catastrophic forgetting. The vehicle trajectory prediction model is trained by the replayed trajectories and achieves consistent prediction performance on visited cities. A lifelong experiment setup is established on four open datasets including five tasks. Spatiotemporal dependency divergence is calculated for different tasks. Even though these divergence, the proposed framework exhibits lifelong learning ability and achieves consistent performance on all tasks.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=10214197,IEEE Transactions on Intelligent Transportation Systems,2023

In what follows, two theorems, which include both input to state stability (ISS) criterion and controller design method, are carefully derived for the path following control of UGVs under the proposed ET-ASC scheme. The advantage of the proposed ET-ASC scheme lies in that it can actively amend the sensor attacks in an adaptive way and exclude Zeno phenomenon naturally. At last, a verification simulation experiment are conducted to show the effectiveness of the proposed ET-ASC method.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=10056976,IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology,2023
"A Systematic Literature Review on Automotive Digital Forensics: Challenges, Technical Solutions and Data Collection","A modern vehicle has a complex internal architecture and is wirelessly connected to the Internet, other vehicles, and the infrastructure. The risk of cyber attacks and other criminal incidents along with recent road accidents caused by autonomous vehicles calls for more research on automotive digital forensics. Failures in automated driving functions can be caused by hardware and software failures and cyber security issues. Thus, it is imperative to be able to determine and investigate the cause of these failures, something which requires trustable data. However, automotive digital forensics is a relatively new field for the automotive where most existing self-monitoring and diagnostic systems in vehicles only monitor safety-related events. To the best of our knowledge, our work is the first systematic literature review on the current research within this field. We identify and assess over 300 papers published between 2006–2021 and further map the relevant papers to different categories based on identified focus areas to give a comprehensive overview of the forensics field and the related research activities. Moreover, we identify forensically relevant data from the literature, link the data to categories, and further map them to required security properties and potential stakeholders. Our categorization makes it easy for practitioners and researchers to quickly find relevant work within a particular sub-field of digital forensics. We believe our contributions can guide digital forensic investigations in automotive and similar areas, such as cyber-physical systems and smart cities, facilitate further research, and serve as a guideline for engineers implementing forensics mechanisms.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9815132,IEEE Transactions on Intelligent Vehicles,2023
Lightweight Encryption and Authentication for Controller Area Network of Autonomous Vehicles,"With the rapid development of autonomous vehicles (AVs), vehicle safety has attracted attention. Controller area network (CAN) bus without authentication and encryption mechanisms is a weakness of the in-vehicle network (IVN), and attackers always primarily target the CAN bus. Attacks on the AVs' CAN bus are more frequent because AVs have more external interfaces and sensors than ordinary vehicles. To address the abovementioned issues, this paper proposes a lightweight encryption and authentication scheme for the CAN bus of AVs using message authentication codes and Grain stream cipher. The scheme realizes efficient authentication between electronic control units and a counter re-synchronization protocol is used to ensure that authentication failure owing to counter inconsistency is prevented. Blom key management scheme is employed to rapidly distribute and update session keys, avoiding the complicated process of updating pairwise keys. In addition, considering the scalability of the IVN, a key distribution protocol for new nodes was provided.

In addition, performance analysis shows that the proposed scheme can meet real-time requirements and has little impact on the busload.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=10138618,IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology,2023
Deep Active Learning Intrusion Detection and Load Balancing in Software-Defined Vehicular Networks,"Software-defined vehicular networks (SDVN) can help analyze and reconfigure networks. Massive data generation in autonomous vehicles can lead to issues in network configuration, routing, network characteristics, and system load factors. Load balancing in vehicle sensors helps reduce delays and improve resource utilization. In this paper, we propose a load balancing algorithm to map sensor data, vehicles and data centers performing tasks. A dynamic convergence method is proposed to help identify vehicle system load factors and compare their termination criteria. We also propose a packet-level intrusion detection model. After all load balancing, the model can track the attack on the network. The proposed model further combines the entropy-based active learning and the attention-based model to efficiently identify the attacks. Experiments are then conducted on the standard KDD data to validate the developed models with and without an attention-based active learning mechanism. Our experimental results show that the load balancing mechanism is able to achieve more performance gains than previous techniques. Moreover, the results show that the developed model can improve the decision boundary by using a pooling strategy and an entropy uncertainty measure.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9764665,IEEE Transactions on Intelligent Transportation Systems,2023
Fast Reactive Mechanism for Desired Trajectory Attacks on Unmanned Aerial Vehicles,"Malware, exposed on the ground control station, can tamper with the unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) interaction information. It makes UAVs vulnerable to the desired trajectory attacks, which deteriorates the flight safety if no timely action is taken. Therefore, this article focus on fast reactive mechanism for desired trajectory attacks on UAVs. A fixed-time detection scheme is proposed based on fixed-time unknown inputs observer and trajectory tracking errors. Subsequently, a fixed-time sliding mode attack observer is developed to compensate the effect caused by attacks. Meanwhile, the estimation errors of attacks can be stabilized within fixed time. Finally, experiment tests are presented to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed methods.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9964293,IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics,2023
Secure Consensus of Multiagent Systems With DoS Attacks via Fully Distributed Dynamic Event-Triggered Control,"This article investigates the secure consensus problem of general linear multiagent systems with denial-of-service (DoS) attacks. Owning to the existence of DoS attacks, it is challenging to investigate the event-triggered control of multiagent systems in a fully distributed manner. This article presents a novel dynamic event-triggered mechanism to alleviate the limited communication resources. Moreover, the designed mechanism is fully distributed and scalable owing to the introduction of some adaptive coupling weights. Since the DoS attacks have been considered in the event-triggered rule design, a novel adaptive parameter with an additional exponential term is adopted to deal with DoS attacks. The Lyapunov design also introduces such a term for the subsequent stability analysis. Sufficient conditions guaranteeing the asymptotic consensus of the studied system are developed in light of the controller’s parameters, duration, and frequency of the DoS attacks. Strict proof is provided to demonstrate that a secure consensus can be reached effectively under the proposed control mechanism. Furthermore, it is shown that the Zeno behavior can be excluded from the designed triggering mechanism. Finally, simulations on a multiagent system consisting of interconnected unmanned intelligent vehicles are conducted to verify the results.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=10159674,"IEEE Transactions on Systems, Man, and Cybernetics: Systems",2023
Secure Control Design for Networked Control Systems With Nonlinear Dynamics Under Time-Delay-Switch Attacks,"A continuous controller is developed for a centralized network control system (NCS), which is composed of agents with nonlinear dynamics subject to a time-delay-switch (TDS) attack and additive disturbances. Since the state tracking error is unmeasurable during TDS attacks, controllers cannot use the state tracking error to coordinate the NCS. Therefore, a novel error signal is designed to address this unique challenge and enable the NCS to achieve a formation control objective. Furthermore, a TDS attack mitigation strategy is developed, which uses both learning- and model-based approaches to estimate an agent’s state for TDS attack detection and compensation. Lyapunov–Krasovskii functionals are used in the stability analysis to prove that the tracking errors converge to a steady-state residual, which is a function of the system uncertainty and TDS attack properties. The leader–follower formation control problem for unmanned aerial vehicles based on a pure pursuit guidance law is selected for a simulation study to validate the performance of the proposed method.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9720959,IEEE Transactions on Automatic Control,2023
LoS-Map Construction for Proactive Relay of Opportunity Selection in 6G V2X Systems,"Recent advances in Vehicle-to-Everything (V2X) technology and the upcoming sixth-generation (6G) network will dawn a new era for vehicular services with enhanced communication capabilities. Connected and Autonomous Vehicles (CAVs) are expected to deliver a new transportation experience, increasing the safety and efficiency of road networks. The use of millimeter-wave (mmW) frequencies guarantees a huge amount of bandwidth ($>$1 GHz) and a high data rate ($>$10 Gbit/s), which are required for CAVs applications. However, high frequency is impaired by severe path loss, and line of sight (LoS) propagation can be easily blocked by static and dynamic obstacles. Several solutions are being investigated, and the most promising one exploits relays. However, traditional relay schemes react to link failure and leverage instantaneous information, which impedes efficient relay selection in highly mobile and complex networks, such as vehicular scenarios. In this context, we propose a novel proactive relaying strategy that exploits the cooperation between CAVs and environment information to predict the dynamic LoS-map, which describes the links' evolution in time. The proactive relaying schemes exploit the dynamic LoS-map to maximize the network connectivity. A novel framework integrating realistic mobility patterns and geometric channel propagation models is proposed to analyze the performance in different scenarios. Numerical simulations suggest that a novel proactive relaying strategy that exploits the cooperation between CAVs and environment information to predict the dynamic LoS-map, which describes the links' evolution in time.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9932026,IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology,2023
Dynamic UAV Swarm Confrontation: An Imitation Based on Mobile Adaptive Networks,"Cooperative unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) swarms could expand the mission capability of the single UAV and the overall combat effectiveness. We consider the dynamic scenarios where an UAV swarm confronts multiple maneuvering high-value targets (HVTs) and multiple maneuvering attackers. In such hostile scenarios, each UAV of the UAV swarm would generally strive to survive through collaboratively offending their opponents and self-defense from potential attacks. We consider modeling UAV swarms as biologically inspired mobile adaptive networks to imitate the dynamic confrontations of UAV swarms. It is essential to develop an efficient motion control mechanism underpinned by both target tracking and decision making so as to enhance the capability of UAV swarms. We formulate a distributed modularized framework incorporating collaboratively tracking multiple opponents, making successive and prompt decisions, and controlling motion mechanism for mobile adaptive networks. We develop the diffusion multitask interactive Kalman filter to efficiently track multiple preys (HVTs) and multiple predators (attackers). We further develop the collaborative decision making on prey pursuit or predator evasion such that each UAV would acquire early warnings and predictions of the most hypothetically threatening predators to enhance the effectiveness of self-defense. Moreover, we develop a composite motion control mechanism, such that each UAV would be steered toward the prey or away from any approaching predator in a self-organized manner at a variable speed. The modular design of the proposed framework would promote the affordability and adaptability of UAV swarms. Illustrative simulation results validate the efficacy of the proposed distributed framework and the underlying algorithms.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=10158783,IEEE Transactions on Aerospace and Electronic Systems,2023
An Attentive Spatio-Temporal Learning-Based Network for Cardiovascular Disease Diagnosis,"Automated diagnosis of cardiovascular diseases (CVDs) has become an imperative need for remote or in-hospital heart monitoring. This is a challenging task because of the tenuous morphological variation of the electrocardiogram (ECG) signal across different cardiac diseases. Existing works have attempted to learn the diagnostic representation by capturing the lead-specific morphological variation of a multilead ECG signal. In this work, we have developed an attentive spatio-temporal learning network (ASTLNet) that can learn better diagnostic representation by exploiting the concurrent spatio-temporal variation of a multilead ECG signal. The ASTLNet consists of two modules, i.e., spatio-temporal representation learning (STRL) module and attentive spatio-temporal aggregation (ASTA) module. The STRL module is designed to learn the multiscale spatio-temporal representation, and the ASTA module is designed to aggregate the learned representation. Experiments on the three publicly available datasets, i.e., PTB, PTB-XL, and CPSC-2018, demonstrate that the proposed model can effectively learn the spatio-temporal variation of the ECG signal and gives superior performance compared to the state-of-the-art methods.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=10080902,"IEEE Transactions on Systems, Man, and Cybernetics: Systems",2023
Modeling Human Driving Behavior Through Generative Adversarial Imitation Learning,"An open problem in autonomous vehicle safety validation is building reliable models of human driving behavior in simulation. This work presents an approach to learn neural driving policies from real world driving demonstration data. We model human driving as a sequential decision making problem that is characterized by non-linearity and stochasticity, and unknown underlying cost functions. Imitation learning is an approach for generating intelligent behavior when the cost function is unknown or difficult to specify. Building upon work in inverse reinforcement learning (IRL), Generative Adversarial Imitation Learning (GAIL) aims to provide effective imitation even for problems with large or continuous state and action spaces, such as modeling human driving. This article describes the use of GAIL for learning-based driver modeling. Because driver modeling is inherently a multi-agent problem, where the interaction between agents needs to be modeled, this paper describes a parameter-sharing extension of GAIL called PS-GAIL to tackle multi-agent driver modeling. In addition, GAIL is domain agnostic, making it difficult to encode specific knowledge relevant to driving in the learning process. This paper describes Reward Augmented Imitation Learning (RAIL), which modifies the reward signal to provide domain-specific knowledge to the agent. Finally, human demonstrations are dependent upon latent factors that may not be captured by GAIL. This paper describes Burn-InfoGAIL, which allows for disentanglement of latent variability in demonstrations. Imitation learning experiments are performed using NGSIM, a real-world highway driving dataset. Experiments show that these modifications to GAIL can successfully model highway driving behavior, accurately replicating human demonstrations and generating realistic, emergent behavior in the traffic flow arising from the interaction between driving agents.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9990591,IEEE Transactions on Intelligent Transportation Systems,2023
CGAN-Based Collaborative Intrusion Detection for UAV Networks: A Blockchain-Empowered Distributed Federated Learning Approach,"Numerous resource-constrained Internet of Things (IoT) devices make the edge IoT consisting of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) vulnerable to network intrusion. Therefore, it is critical to design an effective intrusion detection system (IDS). However, the differences in local data sets among UAVs show small samples and uneven distribution, further reducing the detection accuracy of network intrusion. This article proposes a conditional generative adversarial net (CGAN)-based collaborative intrusion detection algorithm with blockchain-empowered distributed federated learning to solve the above problems. This study introduces long short-term memory (LSTM) into the CGAN training to improve the effect of generative networks. Based on the feature extraction ability of LSTM networks, the generated data with CGAN are used as augmented data and applied in the detection and classification of intrusion data. Distributed federated learning with differential privacy ensures data security and privacy and allows collaborative training of CGAN models using multiple distributed data sets. Blockchain stores and shares the training models to ensure security when the global model’s aggregation and updating. The proposed method has good generalization ability, which can greatly improve the detection of intrusion data.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9863068,IEEE Internet of Things Journal,2023
Comparative Study of Real-Time Semantic Segmentation Networks in Aerial Images During Flooding Events,"Real-time semantic segmentation of aerial imagery is essential for unmanned ariel vehicle applications, including military surveillance, land characterization, and disaster damage assessments. Recent real-time semantic segmentation neural networks promise low computation and inference time, appropriate for resource-limited platforms, such as edge devices. However, these methods are mainly trained on human-centric view datasets, such as Cityscapes and CamVid, unsuitable for aerial applications. Furthermore, we do not know the feasibility of these models under adversarial settings, such as flooding events. To solve these problems, we train the most recent real-time semantic segmentation architectures on the FloodNet dataset containing annotated aerial images captured after hurricane Harvey. This article comprehensively studies several lightweight architectures, including encoder–decoder and two-pathway architectures, evaluating their performance on aerial imagery datasets. Moreover, we benchmark the efficiency and accuracy of different models on the FloodNet dataset to examine the practicability of these models during emergency response for aerial image segmentation. Some lightweight models attain more than 60% test mIoU on the FloodNet dataset and yield qualitative results on images. This article highlights the strengths and weaknesses of current segmentation models for aerial imagery, requiring low computation and inference time. Our experiment has direct applications during catastrophic events, such as flooding events.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9939092,IEEE Journal of Selected Topics in Applied Earth Observations and Remote Sensing,2023
Federated Imitation Learning for UAV Swarm Coordination in Urban Traffic Monitoring,"The popularization of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) has boosted various civil applications such as traffic monitoring, in which the effective coordination of the UAV swarm plays a significant role in expanding the monitoring range and enhancing the execution efficiency. However, due to the isolated local environments as well as the heterogeneous execution capabilities, it is challenging to achieve highly consistent actions. In this article, we incorporate the federated learning framework with the imitation learning technique to coordinate the UAVs' maneuvers by interactively imitating the leader UAV's operations. During the interagent global model download phase, we utilize the generative adversarial imitation learning (GAIL) model to accurately follow the leader UAV's operations by removing the biased estimates of imitation parameters. While in the intraagent local model training phase, we utilize the self-imitation learning (SIL) model to correct delicate imitation errors by virtue of the follower UAVs' own historical valuable experiences. In order to achieve more efficient distributed parameter interactions, we regularize the federated gradient updates and eventually yield coordinated swarm policies. We evaluate the proposed algorithm in the UAV-based traffic monitoring scenario. Evaluation results demonstrate the superiorities on training and execution efficiencies.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9834117,IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics,2023
RFM-GAN: Robust Feature Matching With GAN-Based Neighborhood Representation for Agricultural Remote Sensing Image Registration,"Remote sensing (RS) images often encounter various challenges arising from differences in shooting time, location, equipment, sensors, and other factors. These disparities lead to image distortion and insufficient overlap between pairs of images captured at the same location. Consequently, the accuracy of agricultural RS image registration is significantly compromised. This letter proposes a robust feature-matching technique called GAN-based neighborhood representation (RFM-GAN) for the intricate registration of satellite images and unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) images. The RFM-GAN method leverages a neighborhood representation approach based on a generative adversarial network (GAN) with two discriminators. This representation enhances the distinction between true matches (inliers) and false matches (outliers). Additionally, a dissimilarity measure network employing a self-supervised training approach, eliminating the need for manual labeling, is designed to handle the multiview transformation of satellite and UAV images. The experimental results confirm that RFM-GAN outperforms seven other state-of-the-art methods in terms of satellite image and UAV image processing.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=10137752,IEEE Geoscience and Remote Sensing Letters,2023
Dynamic Path Planning Algorithm for Unmanned Surface Vehicle Under Island–Reef Environment,"The marine environment surrounding islands and reefs exhibit significant time-varying characteristics, which require the path planning algorithm of an unmanned surface vehicle (USV) to have good environmental adaptability. To this end, a dynamic path planning algorithm for USV under an island–reef environment is proposed. The algorithm fully considers these environmental features, such as ocean currents, tides, and winds, to construct an environment model. The environment model is combined with the USV motion model to construct a path planning model under the constraint of environmental disturbance time windows. This approach ensures that the path planning model can adapt to the time-varying marine environment. At the same time, to improve the safety of USV navigation by effectively predicting and timely avoiding passing ships, the velocity obstacle method is introduced for establishing a collision risk assessment model that detects the threat level of passing ships in the vicinity of the USV. Based on the decision-making basis generated by the model, a path replanning model is constructed under the constraint of collision detection time windows. This improves the dynamic collision avoidance capability of the path replanning model. Furthermore, to speed up the solution speed and accuracy of the path planning model and the path replanning model, the multiobjective particle swarm optimization algorithm is improved in three aspects: particle coding method, particle update strategy, and external archive maintenance mechanism. Simulation results show that the algorithm can enable USV to safely avoid multiple close-range dynamic obstacles under maritime rules, while also demonstrating a high level of adaptability to the time-varying marine environment.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=10163065,IEEE Transactions on Aerospace and Electronic Systems,2023
UAV Trajectory and Multi-User Beamforming Optimization for Clustered Users Against Passive Eavesdropping Attacks With Unknown CSI,"This article tackles the fundamental passive eavesdropping problem in modern wireless communications in which the location and the channel state information (CSI) of the attackers are unknown. In this regard, we propose deploying an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) that serves as a mobile aerial relay (AR) to help ground base station (GBS) support a subset of vulnerable users. More precisely, our solution (1) clusters the single-antenna users in two groups to be either served by the GBS directly or via the AR, (2) employs optimal multi-user beamforming to the directly served users, and (3) optimizes the AR's 3D position, its multi-user beamforming matrix and transmit powers by combining closed-form solutions with machine learning techniques. Specifically, we design a plain beamforming and power optimization combined with a deep reinforcement learning (DRL) algorithm for an AR to optimize its trajectory for the security maximization of the served users. Numerical results show that the multi-user multiple input, single output (MU-MISO) system split between a GBS and an AR with optimized transmission parameters without knowledge of the eavesdropping channels achieves high secrecy capacities that scale well with increasing the number of users. Index Terms: UAV-assisted, beamforming, DRL, eavesdropping, MU-MISO, physical layer security, power control, trajectory optimization.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=10153699,IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology,2023
Secrecy Rate Degradation of Ground-to-Air Collaborative Beamforming Due to UAV Jitter,"In this article, we consider the secure uplink transmissions from ground nodes to an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) receiver through analog collaborative beamforming (ACB). When the location information of the UAV receiver is available, ACB can be realized in a fully distributed manner, since each transmitting node can locally adjust its phase. ACB-based physical layer security (PLS) algorithm, where the virtual antenna array (VAA) elements are randomly selected at each transmit time unit, can effectively protect against eavesdropping attacks by creating artificial noise to the directions except the legitimate receiver (Bob). However, when Bob is mounted on the UAV, it can suffer from array gain loss due to jittering effects caused by airflow turbulence and mechanical vibration. Motivated by this issue, in this article, we investigate the impact of the UAV jitter on the secrecy performance. We derive the theoretical expressions of the secrecy rate both in the absence and presence of the jittering effects. Further, the simulation results show that the ACB-based PLS cannot guarantee non-zero secrecy rate even with the radial distance perturbations on the order of a few centimeters, especially when an eavesdropper (Eve) exists in close proximity to Bob.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=10098913,IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology,2023
Fast Tube Model Predictive Control for Driverless Cars Using Linear Data-Driven Models,"Model predictive control (MPC) has been widely applied to different aspects of autonomous driving, typically using nonlinear physically derived models for prediction. However, feedback control systems inherently correct for model errors, and thus in many applications it is sufficient to use a linear time-invariant (LTI) model for control design, especially when using robust control methods. This philosophy of approach appears to have been neglected in current driverless car research and is the research gap that we aim to address here. Namely, instead of deriving meticulous nonlinear physical models of vehicle dynamics and solving a correspondingly complex optimal control problem (OCP), we identify a low-order data-driven LTI model and handle its uncertainty via robust linear MPC methods. We develop a two-step control scheme for driverless cars based on tube MPC (TMPC), which introduces structural robustness, ensuring constraint compliance despite modeling error in the data-driven prediction model. Furthermore, we use fast optimization methods designed to exploit the special structure of the linear MPC problem. We evaluate the proposed control scheme using a vehicle model identified from real-world data and simulations in IPGCarmaker, where the model of the vehicle under control is inherently nonlinear and uses detailed 3-D physics. Our results show that an LTI model can be effectively used for the task of lane-keeping, that TMPC can prevent lane departure and possible collisions due to model uncertainty, and that linear models allow for several algorithmic improvements that can decrease computation time by an order of magnitude compared with naive MPC implementations.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9966372,IEEE Transactions on Control Systems Technology,2023
ADS-Lead: Lifelong Anomaly Detection in Autonomous Driving Systems,"Autonomous Vehicles (AVs) are closely connected in the Cooperative Intelligent Transportation System (C-ITS). They are equipped with various sensors and controlled by Autonomous Driving Systems (ADSs) to provide high-level autonomy. The vehicles exchange different types of real-time data with each other, which can help reduce traffic accidents and congestion, and improve the efficiency of transportation systems. However, when interacting with the environment, AVs suffer from a broad attack surface, and the sensory data are susceptible to anomalies caused by faults, sensor malfunctions, or attacks, which may jeopardize traffic safety and result in serious accidents. In this paper, we propose ADS-Lead, an efficient collaborative anomaly detection methodology to protect the lane-following mechanism of ADSs. ADS-Lead is equipped with a novel transformer-based one-class classification model to identify time series anomalies (GPS spoofing threat) and adversarial image examples (traffic sign and lane recognition attacks). Besides, AVs inside the C-ITS form a cognitive network, enabling us to apply the federated learning technology to our anomaly detection method, where the vehicles in the C-ITS jointly update the detection model with higher model generalization and data privacy. Experiments on Baidu Apollo and two public data sets (GTSRB and Tumsimple) indicate that our method can not only detect sensor anomalies effectively and efficiently but also outperform state-of-the-art anomaly detection methods.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9690769,IEEE Transactions on Intelligent Transportation Systems,2023
Risk Assessment for Connected Vehicles Under Stealthy Attacks on Vehicle-to-Vehicle Networks,"Cooperative Adaptive Cruise Control (CACC) is an autonomous vehicle-following technology that allows groups of vehicles on the highway to form in tightly-coupled platoons. This is accomplished by exchanging inter-vehicle data through Vehicle-to-Vehicle (V2V) wireless communication networks. CACC increases traffic throughput and safety, and decreases energy consumption. However, the surge of vehicle connectivity has brought new security challenges as vehicular networks increasingly serve as new access points for adversaries trying to deteriorate the platooning performance or even cause collisions. In this manuscript, we propose a novel anomaly detection scheme that leverage real-time sensor/network data and physics-based mathematical models of vehicles in the platoon. Nevertheless, even the best detection scheme could lead to conservative detection results because of unavoidable modelling uncertainties, network effects (delays, quantization, communication dropouts), and noise. It is hard (often impossible) for any detector to distinguish between these different perturbation sources and actual attack signals. This enables adversaries to launch a range of attack strategies that can surpass the detection scheme by hiding within the system uncertainty. Here, we provide risk assessment tools (in terms of semi-definite programs) for Connected and Automated Vehicles (CAVs) to quantify the potential effect of attacks that remain hidden from the detector (referred here as stealthy attacks). A numerical case-study is presented to illustrate the effectiveness of our methods.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=10184481,IEEE Transactions on Intelligent Transportation Systems,2023
Formulating Vehicle Aggressiveness Towards Social Cognitive Autonomous Driving,"Accurately identifying the driving threat could greatly improve the driving safety for autonomous vehicles in the mixed traffic, where the human-driven and driverless, as well as different types of vehicles coexist. The existing safety evaluation methods merely focus on the possibility of collision, which is deficient to evaluate the hazard level due to the symmetry for both the interactive vehicles. Thus, the vehicle aggressiveness model is proposed in this paper based on the asymmetric interactions between different types of vehicles from the perspective of the social cognitions in the human driving. Firstly, a new conceptual framework of the vehicle aggressiveness is constructed, and the factors are analyzed. Secondly, the general mathematic formulation of the aggressiveness is deduced elaborately based on the analogy with the mechanical wave. Thirdly, the simplified formulation is derived by introducing resonant assumption, and an illustration of aggressiveness distribution is presented and discussed. The mathematical analysis and simulation results indicate that the proposed model could explicitly describe the asymmetric characteristics as regards the vehicle mass, motion states and position. Finally, the potential applications in safety assessment, decision-making and motion planning of the social cognitive autonomous driving are discussed. The aggressiveness model provides a new perspective in asymmetric driving safety evaluation and heterogeneous driving behavior model under complex and mixed traffic environments.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=10007052,IEEE Transactions on Intelligent Vehicles,2023
Secure Operations of Connected and Autonomous Vehicles,"With features of collaborative interaction and autonomous decision-making, connected and autonomous vehicles (CAVs) offer a viable solution for a sustainable and efficient future of transportation. However, with the development of CAVs, questions have been raised about weaknesses in cybersecurity and autonomous driving capabilities. In particular, CAVs provide new opportunities for cyberattackers, posing a significant threat to future road and vehicle data security. Therefore, this paper provides a comprehensive analysis of the cybersecurity environment of CAVs. First, we propose a systematic classification of six security threats from cybersecurity principles: false data, information theft, privilege escalation, block communication, and time delay. We review the cybersecurity environment of CAVs from a lifecycle perspective, covering aspects from development to accident, and present the existing cybersecurity countermeasures. These involve security standards designation, verification and validation of vehicle networks, resilient strategies for self-defined driving, and attack detection and digital forensics. Finally, based on our systematic review, we propose a conceptual vehicle security operations center (VSOC) framework that provides valuable inspiration and references for future research and industrial applications for CAVs cybersecurity.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=10216307,IEEE Transactions on Intelligent Vehicles,2023
Query-Efficient Adversarial Attack With Low Perturbation Against End-to-End Speech Recognition Systems,"With the widespread use of automated speech recognition (ASR) systems in modern consumer devices, attack against ASR systems have become an attractive topic in recent years. Although related white-box attack methods have achieved remarkable success in fooling neural networks, they rely heavily on obtaining full access to the details of the target models. Due to the lack of prior knowledge of the victim model and the inefficiency in utilizing query results, most of the existing black-box attack methods for ASR systems are query-intensive. In this paper, we propose a new black-box attack called the Monte Carlo gradient sign attack (MGSA) to generate adversarial audio samples with substantially fewer queries. It updates an original sample based on the elements obtained by a Monte Carlo tree search. We attribute its high query efficiency to the effective utilization of the dominant gradient phenomenon, which refers to the fact that only a few elements of each origin sample have significant effect on the output of ASR systems. Extensive experiments are performed to evaluate the efficiency of MGSA and the stealthiness of the generated adversarial examples on the DeepSpeech system. The experimental results show that MGSA achieves 98% and 99% attack success rates on the LibriSpeech and Mozilla Common Voice datasets, respectively. Compared with the state-of-the-art methods, the average number of queries is reduced by 27% and the signal-to-noise ratio is increased by 31%.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9954062,IEEE Transactions on Information Forensics and Security,2023
Active Reconfigurable Intelligent Surface-Assisted MISO Integrated Sensing and Communication Systems for Secure Operation,"Spectrum congestion has motivated the recent introduction of integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) systems where radar and communications functionalities co-exist and share the same spectrum. This is accompanied by extensive research in the area of reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (RIS), thanks to their ability to improve the ISAC systems. In this paper, the physical layer security of a multiuser multiple-input single-output (MU-MISO) ISAC system is investigated when the system is subject to eavesdropping by a malicious unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV). In particular, we propose using an active RIS to maximize the achievable secrecy rate of the system through jointly designing the radar receive beamformers, the active RIS reflection coefficients matrix and the transmit beamformers at the dual-function base station of the ISAC system. This is done while taking into account a minimum radar detection signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) and total system power budget constraints. The resulting non-convex optimization problem is tackled by exploiting fractional programming (FP) and majorization-minimization (MM) techniques to achieve a solution. Our numerical results show the superiority of active RIS to achieve the goal when compared with passive RIS or with an ISAC without an RIS. Results also show that passive RIS could still be a viable solution to achieve this goal but at the expense of a much larger needed size especially when lower power budgets are available.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9973319,IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology,2023
Adaptive Extended Kalman Filter-Based Fusion Approach for High-Precision UAV Positioning in Extremely Confined Environments,"For unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV)-based smart inspection in extremely confined environments, it is impossible for precise UAV positioning with global positioning system, owing to the satellite signal block. Therefore, the ultrawideband (UWB)-based technology has attracted extensive attention under such circumstances. However, due to the unpredictable propagation condition and the time-varying operational environment, the localization performance oscillation caused by the changing measurement noise may lead to the instability of UAV. To mitigate the effects, in this article, a high-precision UAV positioning system which integrates the inertial measurement unit and UWB with the adaptive extended Kalman filter (EKF) is proposed. Compared with the traditional EKF-based approach, the estimated and recorded information from previous processes is exploited to adaptively estimate and further control the estimation of the noise covariance matrices for the performance improvement. Finally, simulations and experiments have been conducted in extremely confined environments. According to the results, the proposed algorithm can significantly improve the position update rate, the median positioning error, the 95${\text{th}}$ percentile positioning error, and the average standard deviation into 88 Hz, 0.102 m, 0.192 m, and 0.052 m, which is applicable for applications in focused environments.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9893405,IEEE/ASME Transactions on Mechatronics,2023
A Multiagent Mission Coordination System for Continuous Situational Awareness of Bushfires,"This paper devises a multi-agent Mission Coordinating Architecture (MCA) to achieve continuous situational awareness (SA) in bushfires, which can help with quick detection and accurate response to the hazards. In this paper, we use Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) as instantiations of physical agents. MCA is a scalable architecture and aims to provide the UAVs with parallel mission plans, adopting a fire spread probability map and the Fuzzy C-means method to avoid mission overlap and duplicate information. The architecture is then enhanced by integrating a synchronized communication framework to facilitate UAVs’ adaptive cooperation and total flight time optimization. Furthermore, integrating the communication framework minimizes the number of deployed UAVs to fully cover the same area, saving considerable cost and energy compared to the Parallel Mode. The scalability challenge of the Parallel Mode, determining the required number of UAVs to cover the entire area, and the efficiency of the mission planning algorithm are thoroughly investigated and compared to the performance of the Communication Mode. Finally, the simulation results prove the MCA’s effectiveness in enhancing the UAVs’ exploration capability, resulting in comprehensive monitoring of all affected areas. Note to Practitioners—The proposed architecture in this research could offer flexibility to increase the number of UAVs on demand without requiring a change and adjustment of the parameters. Furthermore, a synchronized communication framework enhances MCA, enabling all UAVs to share their resources and exploit residual battery time to assist each other, manage the overall operation time, and reduce the total operation cost.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9804398,IEEE Transactions on Automation Science and Engineering,2023
UAV-Assisted Wireless Backhaul Networks: Connectivity Analysis of Uplink Transmissions,"With the proliferation of wireless communication technologies, user equipments (UEs) in rural or disaster areas have data-transmission demand to upload their data to the core network. However, current networks lack coverage in rural or disaster areas due to the absence or damage of/to infrastructures. To address this issue, a promising solution is employing unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) as relays to assist the wireless backhaul of UEs to remote ground base stations (GBSs). For convenience, we call these networks as UAV-assisted wireless backhaul networks (UABNs). This paper aims to investigate the uplink transmission performance in UABNs. In particular, we analyze the connectivity of the two-hop uplink path from a reference UE to a remote GBS via a reference UAV. Compared with previous studies that mostly analyze single-hop transmissions, the investigation of the path connectivity of UABNs is more complex because of the location variation of UAVs as well as the complexity of the interference at the two-hop path. Considering the distribution of UEs, we exploit stochastic geometry to establish a theoretical model to analyze the path connectivity of UABNs. In our model, UEs form clusters according to a Poisson Cluster Process (PCP) and one UAV serves one UE cluster. Based on our model, the connectivity of a two-hop uplink path is finally derived by limiting the signal-to-noise-plus-interference (SINR) above a threshold. Theoretical values of the connectivity of UABNs match with simulation results, confirming the accuracy of the proposed analytical model. Our results also offer insightful implications for constructing and configuring UABNs.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=10104142,IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology,2023
Boosting UAV Tracking With Voxel-Based Trajectory-Aware Pre-Training,"Siamese network-based object tracking has remarkably promoted the automatic capability for highly-maneuvered unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs). However, the leading-edge tracking framework often depends on template matching, making it trapped when facing multiple views of object in consecutive frames. Moreover, the general image-level pretrained backbone can overfit to holistic representations, causing the misalignment to learn object-level properties in UAV tracking. To tackle these issues, this work presents TRTrack, a comprehensive framework to fully exploit the stereoscopic representation for UAV tracking. Specifically, a novel pre-training paradigm method is proposed. Through trajectory-aware reconstruction training (TRT), the capability of the backbone to extract stereoscopic structure feature is strengthened without any parameter increment. Accordingly, an innovative hierarchical self-attention Transformer is proposed to capture the local detail information and global structure knowledge. For optimizing the correlation map, we proposed a novel spatial correlation refinement (SCR) module, which promotes the capability of modeling the long-range spatial dependencies. Comprehensive experiments on three UAV challenging benchmarks demonstrate that the proposed TRTrack achieves superior UAV tracking performance in both precision and efficiency. Quantitative tests in real-world settings fully prove the effectiveness of our work.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=10015867,IEEE Robotics and Automation Letters,2023
UAV Tracking Based on Correlation Filters With Dynamic Aberrance-Repressed Temporal Regularizations,"As a significant research direction in remote sensing fields, unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) tracking has achieved rapid development in recent years. However, due to limited power and computation resources on aerial platforms, the tracking methods deployed on UAVs usually require high computational efficiency and performance. In addition, various challenges (i.e., similar object, background clutter, and occlusion) have inevitably occurred during the UAV tracking phase. Therefore, considering the above issues comprehensively, this article proposes a dynamic aberrance-repressed temporal regularized correlation filter (CF) to achieve stable tracking in UAV remote sensing videos. First, we have introduced the aberrance-repressed temporal regularizations into the discriminative CF framework. Second, a novel objective loss function is constructed to adjust the strength of each regularization for training the filter. Then, a new judgment mechanism based on the response variation is exploited to reflect the response fluctuation and applied to tune parameters of both regularizations. Finally, comprehensive experiments are done on three different UAV benchmarks, i.e., UAV123@10fps, UAVDT, and VisDrone2018, to verify the performance of our tracker and have demonstrated that our tracker achieves superior performance against other total 25 state-of-the-art trackers while reaching $\sim$35 FPS on a single CPU.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=10223259,IEEE Journal of Selected Topics in Applied Earth Observations and Remote Sensing,2023
Multi-Stage RF Emitter Search and Geolocation With UAV: A Cognitive Learning-Based Method,"This paper investigates the issue of searching and geolocating a radio frequency (RF) emitter with an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) in a rich scattering environment. The absence of knowledge of the characteristics of the target RF signals, the ground-to-air channels, and the potential geographical distribution of the RF emitter makes efficient trajectory planning (TP) and geolocating intractable. Since the average signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of the signal captured by the UAV changes across the search area, state-of-the-art TP is inapplicable due to the assumption of a single problem domain, according to the No Free Lunch (NFL) theorem. In contrast, we develop a cognitive multi-stage search and geolocation (CMSG) framework, which adjusts the adopted TP algorithms in various search stages. In the stage with extremely-low SNRs, a random-walk-based TP is proposed to avoid meaningless detours. For stages with higher SNRs, the TP follows policies optimized by a novel search method based on direction of arrival (DOA) estimation and reinforcement learning. To alleviate the impairment of unreliable DOA estimations, empirical emitter position estimations are exploited to find the best flight directions. Simulation results confirm the advantages of the proposed CMSG over various baselines in lowering both failure rate and time consumption.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=10016683,IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology,2023
Reference Tracking for Multiagent Systems Using Model Predictive Control,"In this note, the reference tracking problem for teams of unmanned vehicles subject to formation constraints is solved via a model predictive control (MPC) algorithm built up in a distributed fashion. By exploiting the properties deriving from a novel kinematic description of the swarm agents, the receding horizon control (RHC) approach is properly adapted to deal with tracking and formation constraints. In particular, neighbor interactions are translated into convex conditions, thanks to an in-depth analysis of the geometric properties arising from the combined use of swarm kinematics and state predictions tubes. Experimental results on Elisa-3 robots show the applicability and effectiveness of the proposed control architecture.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9984126,IEEE Transactions on Control Systems Technology,2023
"Orientation-Aware Hierarchical, Adaptive-Resolution A* Algorithm for UAV Trajectory Planning","Successful path planning for Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) in challenging environments with narrow openings, such as disaster areas, requires attitude to be considered. State-of-the-art methods incorporate attitude only in the refinement stage. We introduce a first-of-a-kind global minimum cost path search method based on A* that considers attitude along the path. To make the problem tractable, our method exploits an adaptive and coarse-to-fine approach using global and local A* runs, plus an efficient method to introduce the UAV attitude in the process. We integrate our method with an SE(3) trajectory optimisation method based on a safe-flight-corridor, yielding a complete path planning pipeline. Extensive evaluation is undertaken using the AirSim flight simulator under closed loop control in a set of randomised maps, allowing us to quantitatively assess our method. We show that it achieves significantly higher success rates than the baselines, at a reduced computational burden.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=10229171,IEEE Robotics and Automation Letters,2023
Interference Analysis for UAV Radar Networks With Guard Zones Based on Stochastic Geometry,"Due to the increasing number of aerial radars and joint communication/sensing technologies, interference from uncoordinated radars will limit the target detection and ranging performance in the future. In this article, we investigate the interference behavior in an aerial radar network for sensing ground targets. We consider that the radars mounted on unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) that fly at a certain altitude are randomly distributed according to a two-dimensional homogeneous Poisson point process (HPPP), and that the propagation is modeled using a probabilistic line-of-sight channel model. For such a sensing network, we derive the distribution of the radar interference using a stochastic geometry based analysis. In particular, when Swerling I model is considered for radar cross-section area for the target, we derive the Laplace transform of the radar interference. To avoid a strong interference between neighboring radars, a guard zone is introduced within which the UAV radar transmission around the permitted active radar is inhibited. As the radar performance metric, we derive the successful ranging probability (SRP) of a given radar by exploiting the Laplace transform of radar interference. Using the analytic SRP, we show that we can optimize the radar network parameters such as the radius of the guard zone and the density of the active radars. In addition, we also discuss how the analytic SRP gives an insight into the spectrum utilization strategy for the UAV radar networks with the guard zones.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=10015586,IEEE Transactions on Aerospace and Electronic Systems,2023
Anomaly Detection Against GPS Spoofing Attacks on Connected and Autonomous Vehicles Using Learning From Demonstration,"GPS spoofing attacks pose great challenges to connected vehicle (CVs) safety applications and localization of autonomous vehicles (AVs). In this paper, we propose to utilize transportation and vehicle engineering domain knowledge to detect GPS spoofing attacks towards CVs and AVs. A novel detection method using learning from demonstration is developed, which can be implemented in both vehicles and at the transportation infrastructure. A computational-efficient driving model, which can be learned from historical trajectories of the vehicles, is constructed to predict normal driving behaviors. Then a statistical method is developed to measure the dissimilarities between the observed trajectory and the predicted normal trajectory for anomaly detection. We validate the proposed method using two threat models (i.e., attacks targeting the multi-sensor fusion system of AVs and attacks targeting the intersection movement assist application of CVs) on two real-world datasets (i.e., KAIST and Michigan roundabout dataset). Results show that the proposed model is able to detect almost all of the attacks in time with low false positive and false negative rates.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=10109166,IEEE Transactions on Intelligent Transportation Systems,2023
Reactive Symbolic Planning and Control in Dynamic Adversarial Environments,"Satisfying both safety and reachability requirements in dynamic adversarial environments is very challenging, particularly when little or no information about the dynamics and intentions of the adversarial objects is available. Therefore, this article addresses the problem of path planning and control of autonomous vehicles in a dynamic adversarial reach–avoid scenario with two noncooperative vehicles and their competitive objectives: 1) “reaching a target and avoiding the other vehicle” for one of them, called attacker, and 2) “protecting the target and capturing the opponent vehicle” for the other one, called defender. In the proposed solution, first, a discrete version of the problem is formulated and solved using linear temporal logic, temporal games, and $\mu$-calculus to construct winning discrete strategies that guarantee safety and reachability. A comprehensive discussion on the existence, correctness, and complexity analysis of the solution is also provided. Finally, a novel correct-by-design hybrid controller is designed to generate smooth control signals that preserve the satisfaction of safety and reachability.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9847024,IEEE Transactions on Automatic Control,2023
IIDS: Intelligent Intrusion Detection System for Sustainable Development in Autonomous Vehicles,"Connected and Autonomous Vehicles (CAVs) enable various capabilities and functionalities like automated driving assistance, navigation and path planning, cruise control, independent decision making, and low-carbon transportation in the real-time environment. However, the increased CAVs usage renders the potential vulnerabilities in the Internet of Vehicles (IoV) environment, making it susceptible to cyberattacks. An Intrusion Detection System (IDS) is a technique to report network assaults by potential Autonomous Vehicles (AVs) without encryption and authorization procedures for internal and external vehicular communications. This paper proposes an Intelligent IDS (IIDS) to enhance intrusion detection and categorize malicious AVs using a modified Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) with hyperparameter optimization approaches for IoV systems. The proposed IIDS framework works in a 5G Vehicle-to-Everything (V2X) environment to effectively broadcast messages about malicious AVs. Thus IIDS aids in preventing collisions and chaos, enhancing safety monitoring in the traffic. The experimental results depict that the proposed IIDS achieves 98% accuracy in detecting attacks.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=10144487,IEEE Transactions on Intelligent Transportation Systems,2023
Learned Inertial Odometry for Autonomous Drone Racing,"Inertial odometry is an attractive solution to the problem of state estimation for agile quadrotor flight. It is inexpensive, lightweight, and it is not affected by perceptual degradation. However, only relying on the integration of the inertial measurements for state estimation is infeasible. The errors and time-varying biases present in such measurements cause the accumulation of large drift in the pose estimates. Recently, inertial odometry has made significant progress in estimating the motion of pedestrians. State-of-the-art algorithms rely on learning a motion prior that is typical of humans but cannot be transferred to drones. In this work, we propose a learning-based odometry algorithm that uses an inertial measurement unit (IMU) as the only sensor modality for autonomous drone racing tasks. The core idea of our system is to couple a model-based filter, driven by the inertial measurements, with a learning-based module that has access to the thrust measurements. We show that our inertial odometry algorithm is superior to the state-of-the-art filter-based and optimization-based visual-inertial odometry as well as the state-of-the-art learned-inertial odometry in estimating the pose of an autonomous racing drone. Additionally, we show that our system is comparable to a visual-inertial odometry solution that uses a camera and exploits the known gate location and appearance. We believe that the application in autonomous drone racing paves the way for novel research in inertial odometry for agile quadrotor flight.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=10058169,IEEE Robotics and Automation Letters,2023
UAV-Assisted RSUs for V2X Connectivity Using Voronoi Diagrams in 6G+ Infrastructures,"Sixth-generation networks and vehicular Ad hoc networks advancement brought us to the cusp of a new era. Autonomous Vehicles with a plethora of advanced applications require a substantially enhanced vehicle-to-everything communication network. The infrastructure should efficiently support hyper-fast, ultra-reliable, and low-latency massive data exchange. Roadside units were initially exploited as a promising communication solution to overcome this challenge. However, the challenging integration with the infrastructure led to the investigation of additional solutions. Unmanned aerial vehicles are one of the most dominant assistive solutions due to their inherent advantage of mobility. Moreover, air-to-air and ground-to-air networks are more efficient than ground-to-ground. Nevertheless, it is a prerequisite to leverage the potential of unmanned aerial vehicles to attain nationwide Vehicle-to-Everything connectivity. Therefore, we focused our research orientation on developing a strategy to optimize the network’s coverage within the intelligent transportation systems framework. In particular, we have deployed an innovative algorithmic technique that constructs Voronoi diagrams using circles. Besides, we applied the poison point process to determine the optimum locations of the transceivers’ establishment. Simulation results illustrate full network coverage for the tested area after the required iterations. Also, time complexity evaluation proved the simplicity of the proposed algorithm.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=10127579,IEEE Transactions on Intelligent Transportation Systems,2023
The Art of Defense: Letting Networks Fool the Attacker,"3D perception of objects is critical for many real-world applications, such as autonomous cars and robots. Among them, most state-of-the-art (SOTA) 3D perception systems are based on deep learning models. Recently, the research community found that 3D object classifiers on point cloud based on deep learning are easily fooled by adversarial point cloud craft by attackers. To overcome this, adversarial defenses are considered the most effective ways to improve the robustness of deep learning models, and most adversarial defenses on point cloud are focused on input transformation. However, all previous defense methods decrease the natural accuracy, and the nature of the point cloud classifiers itself has been overlooked. To this end, in this paper, we propose a novel adversarial defense for 3D point cloud classifiers that makes full use of the nature of the point cloud classifiers. Due to the disorder of point cloud, all point cloud classifiers have the property of permutation invariant to the input point cloud. Based on this nature, we design invariant transformations defense (IT-Defense). We show that, even after accounting for obfuscated gradients, our IT-Defense is a resilient defense against SOTA 3D attacks. Moreover, IT-Defense does not hurt clean accuracy compared to previous SOTA 3D defenses. Our code will be available at: https://github.com/cuge1995/ IT-Defense.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=10130393,IEEE Transactions on Information Forensics and Security,2023
Secure Long-Range Autonomous Valet Parking: A Reservation Scheme With Three-Factor Authentication and Key Agreement,"Long-range autonomous valet parking (LAVP) is a current trend, partly due to traffic congestion and parking headache. For large-scale parking demands, reservation is introduced to effectively manage valet parking. However, existing schemes focus on parking request verification and parking check-in, which aren't applicable to LAVP because they ignore identity legitimacy and communication security in the phase of picking up as well as dropping off passengers. One viable solution is authentication and key agreement (AKA) protocol. Generally, due to low entropy of passwords and dictionary attacks, three-factor (i.e. passwords, biometrics, and smart card) AKA is more secure than single- and two-factor AKA. Unfortunately, known attacks and high overheads hinder the application of three-factor AKA in real-world environments. Hence, one of the most tough tasks is to balance security and availability, especially how to address the potential threats introduced by each factor while taking full advantage of three factors. Inspired by the above challenges, we propose a provably secure three-factor AKA protocol for reservation services in LAVP, namely SecLAVP. Specifically, the passenger and the autonomous vehicle ($AV$) complete mutual authentication with the assistance of drop-off/pick-up point ($DP$). After successful authentication, the session key is generated between the passenger, $DP$, and $AV$ for secure communication. In the Real-Or-Random (ROR) model, we formally prove SecLAVP satisfies session-key security. Then, we apply AVISPA to simulate our proposed protocol, to demonstrate that SecLAVP can resist man-in-the-middle attacks. Additionally, informal security analysis indicates that SecLAVP satisfies our defined 16 design goals concerning security. Finally, we evaluate performance of SecLAVP in terms of communication overheads, computational overheads, and scheduling, to manifest the feasibility.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9930623,IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology,2023
Secure Data Sharing With Flexible Cross-Domain Authorization in Autonomous Vehicle Systems,"As an increasingly prevalent technology in intelligent autonomous transportation systems, autonomous vehicle platoon has been indicated the ability to significantly reduce fuel consumption as well as heighten highway safety and throughput. However, existing efforts rarely focus on protecting data confidentiality and authenticity in autonomous vehicle platoons. How to ensure secure and high-fidelity platoon-level communication is still in its infancy. This paper makes the first attempt for efficient and secure communication across autonomous vehicle platoons. Specifically, we present PDSM-FC, the first privacy-preserving data share mechanism with flexible cross-domain authorization over distinctive platoons. The key insight of PDSM-FC is the design of a new ciphertext conversion technique, which allows a ciphertext to be easily converted into another type of ciphertext, facilitating efficient access by all entities holding the legitimate authorization. As a result, PDSM-FC can achieve high-fidelity data communication between two unique platoons in ciphertext, so as to complete specific tasks including platoon integration. Rigorous security analysis shows that PDSM-FC is secure against various attacks such as collusion, forgery and chosen-plaintext attacks. Moreover, theoretical evaluation and extensive experiments demonstrate the practicability of PDSM-FC in terms of functionality, storage and computation overheads.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9737055,IEEE Transactions on Intelligent Transportation Systems,2023
A Data-Driven Cyber–Physical System Using Deep-Learning Convolutional Neural Networks: Study on False-Data Injection Attacks in an Unmanned Ground Vehicle Under Fault-Tolerant Conditions,"Leveraging the benefits of deep-learning convolutional neural networks, we introduce a new data-driven cyber–physical system specifically designed to address the vulnerability of middleware software, namely, Robot Operating System (ROS), widely implemented in robotics in both civilian and military domains. As for our research platform, we employ the GVR-BOT unmanned ground vehicle, which is a replicate of the U.S. Army ground robot. We focus our study on the ability of the ground robot to operate under fault-tolerant conditions, making it challenging from the standpoint of cybersecurity to differentiate between legitimate and malicious operations. The GVR-BOT ground vehicle belongs to a class of differential drive ground robots and employs ROS in its onboard computer to interact with users. To facilitate deep learning, we develop a large database of images based on the network-traffic data of ROS, describing the dynamics of the GVR-BOT ground robot under legitimate and malicious operations. We use our image database to train and validate the performance of our deep-learning CNN system. Given a set of RGB/grayscale images describing the normalized time-series data representing the dynamics of the GVR-BOT ground robot, the objective of our proposed cybersecurity algorithm is to safeguard the legitimate operation of the ground robot under fault-tolerant conditions, such that any attempts to compromise its performance (e.g., malicious attacks) can be prevented within the minimum detection time. Our research indicates a promising result as our system is capable of detecting malicious attacks with high accuracy while recognizing its legitimate operations with reasonably small false-positive rates.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9812734,"IEEE Transactions on Systems, Man, and Cybernetics: Systems",2023
Resilient Control for Multiagent Systems With a Sampled-Data Model Against DoS Attacks,"To reduce the computational burden and resist the denial-of-service (DoS) attacks, a resilient distributed sampled-data control scheme is proposed for multiagent systems. The agent states are sampled periodically by the sensors. DoS attacks disrupt the data communication from transmitters to controllers randomly or periodically with a limited duration time. Information on DoS attacks can be obtained by introducing novel logic processors embedded in corresponding controllers. Next, the problem of resilient control can be converted into one concerned with the upper and lower bound of the sampling interval of an aperiodic sampled-data control system. Some sufficient criteria for developing resilient distributed controllers are derived using the novel looped Lyapunov functional approach and the free-matrix-based inequality method. Finally, two illustrative examples, unmanned aerial vehicles and the two-mass-spring systems, are provided to demonstrate the efficiency of the proposed resilient distributed sampled-data control protocols against the DoS attacks.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9751412,IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics,2023
QoS-Dependent Event-Triggered Control for UAVs on Cognitive Radio Networks Subject to Deception Attacks,"Based on cognitive radio (CR) networks, this paper considers event-triggered control for unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) systems subject to deception attacks. Two states (ON and OFF) are switched in CR networks. For the switched model, a new Quality of Service (QoS)-dependent event-triggered scheme (ETS) is proposed over CR networks under deception attacks. For a non-ideal QoS, more sensitive trigger parameters are required against deception attacks. For an ideal QoS, less sensitive trigger parameters are adjusted to reduce data transmissions. Based on the QoS-dependent ETS, a new switched system is modeled subject to deception attacks. By constructing the Lyapunov functional, the criteria are obtained to guarantee the exponential mean-square stability of UAV systems and the desired $\mathcal {L}_{\infty }$ performance. Moreover, an algorithm is developed to adjust the parameters of QoS-dependent ETS according to the QoS of CR network. Finally, an UAV system is utilized to show the effectiveness of the proposed approach.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=10111014,IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology,2023
UAV-Assisted Multi-Access Computation Offloading via Hybrid NOMA and FDMA in Marine Networks,"With the rapid development of marine networks, there have been growing demands for computation-intensive and delay-sensitive marine applications and services. However, the limited underwater energy supply and the acoustic channels result in the low efficiency for computing tasks and high transmission delay. In this paper, we investigate the unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs)-assisted multi-access computation offloading in marine networks, with the objective of minimizing the energy consumption of ocean devices. Specifically, for the underwater segment, we consider the scenario that multiple underwater sensor nodes (USNs) covered by the unmanned surface vehicle (USV) upload their sensing data via non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) for improving the channel utilization. For the radio frequency segment, we consider the scenario that multiple UAVs hovering in the air act as the aerial edge servers for providing computing services, in which the USV offloads the workloads to UAVs via frequency division multiple access (FDMA) for avoiding their co-channel interference, while taking into account that a malicious node overhears the USV's offloading transmission. To improve the computation offloading efficiency, we formulate an optimization problem for USNs and USV to minimize the total energy consumption by jointly optimizing the USN's uploading time, USV's computation offloading, USV's offloading time, and the secrecy provisioning. Despite the non-convexity of the formulated joint optimization problem, we exploit a layered structure to decompose the problem, and propose efficient algorithms to obtain the optimal solutions. Finally, we conduct simulations to validate the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed algorithms. Numerical results demonstrate that our algorithms can significantly reduce the energy consumption in comparison with the benchmark schemes.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9882311,IEEE Transactions on Network Science and Engineering,2023
Distributed Graph-Based Optimization of Multicast Data Dissemination for Internet of Vehicles,"The Internet of Vehicles (IoV) is a promising paradigm for autonomous driving, where the sensing data from the onboard sensors can be disseminated and processed cooperatively via vehicle-to-vehicle links. Autonomous vehicles can share their local views for cooperative, reliable, and robust driving decisions. However, the limited wireless resources may become the bottleneck with the increasing number of vehicles. The technical challenges also arise from the decentralized control, the spatial couplings of decisions, and the complexity of combinatorial optimization. This paper proposes a novel fully distributed graph-based approach to jointly optimize multicast link establishment with data dissemination and processing decisions by only exchanging partial information among neighboring vehicles. The mixed-integer programming problem aims to maximize system energy efficiency while achieving maximum data throughput. We prove that maximizing data processing throughput is submodular optimization to find the local optimum efficiently. The optimization of data dissemination and processing is reformulated to a minimum-cost maximum-flow problem in a three-layer graph, and efficiently solved by exploiting the graphical interdependence. Both simulation-generated and trace-based datasets are evaluated to validate the effectiveness of the proposed approach in terms of data throughput and energy efficiency.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9989340,IEEE Transactions on Intelligent Transportation Systems,2023
ETD: An Efficient Time Delay Attack Detection Framework for UAV Networks,"In recent years, Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) networks are widely used in both military and civilian scenarios. However, due to the distributed nature, they are also vulnerable to threats from adversaries. Time delay attack is a type of internal attack which maliciously delays the transmission of data packets and further causes great damage to UAV networks. Furthermore, it is easy to implement and difficult to detect due to the avoidance of packet modification and the unique characteristics of UAV networks. However, to the best of our knowledge, there is no research on time delay attack detection in UAV networks. In this paper, we propose an Efficient Time Delay Attack Detection Framework (ETD). First, we collect and select delay-related features from four different dimensions, namely delay, node, message and connection. Meanwhile, we utilize the pre-planned trajectory information to accurately calculate the real forwarding delay of nodes. Then, one-class classification is used to train the detection model, and the forwarding behaviors of all nodes can be evaluated, based on which their trust values can be obtained. Finally, the K-Means clustering method is used to distinguish malicious nodes from benign ones according to their trust values. Through extensive simulation, we demonstrate that ETD can achieve higher than 80% detection accuracy with less than 2.5% extra overhead in various settings of UAV networks and different routing protocols.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=10115020,IEEE Transactions on Information Forensics and Security,2023
Secure Transmission Scheme Based on Joint Radar and Communication in Mobile Vehicular Networks,"Vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) communication applications face significant challenges to security and privacy since all types of possible breaches are common in connected and autonomous vehicles (CAVs) networks. As an inheritance from conventional wireless services, potential eavesdropping is one of the main threats to V2V communications. In our work, the anti-eavesdropping scheme in CAVs networks is developed through the use of cognitive risk control (CRC)-based vehicular joint radar-communication (JRC) system. In particular, the supplement of off-board measurements acquired using V2V links to the perceptual information has presented the potential to enhance the traffic target positioning precision. Then, transmission power control is performed utilizing reinforcement learning, the result of which is determined by a task switcher. Based on the threat evaluation, a multiple armed bandit problem is designed to implement the secret key switching procedure when it is needed. Through constant perception-execution loops (PELs), the security and confidentiality is improved for the authorized vehicles in their behavioral interactions with the illegal eavesdropper.

Reachability Analysis Plus Satisfiability Modulo Theories: An Adversary-Proof Control Method for Connected and Autonomous Vehicles,"Connected and autonomous vehicles (CAVs) are expected to operate with safety guarantee in presence of adversaries from the Internet of Vehicles. This article proposes a control method named reachability analysis plus satisfiability modulo theories (RA-SMT) for CAVs against integrity attacks caused by bounded adversary. This method enables vehicles to possess the reach-avoid specification and strict control safety ensurance even in the worst case scenario. The introduction of state-feedback control decomposes the original complex problem into more manageable reachability analysis and adversary-free control strategy optimization. Precisely, zonotope sets are employed for reachability analysis, and the control strategy is optimally solved and verified simultaneously via SMT. This method is applicable to complex traffic scenarios with the help of SMT, which can describe various constraints flexibly and conveniently. Simulation results reveal the effectiveness and safety of the proposed method in the classical car-following scenario against bounded adversary under various conditions. Particularly, RA-SMT exhibits significantly improved control performance (around 16%) and computation efficiency (around 63%) compared with existing methods. Finally, the RA-SMT is implemented on an autonomous driving platform to validate its practicability.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9756285,IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics,2023
Resilient Path Planning of Unmanned Aerial Vehicles Against Covert Attacks on Ultrawideband Sensors,"In this article, a resilient path planning scheme is proposed to navigate an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) to its planned (nominal) destination with minimum energy consumption in the presence of a strategic attacker. The UAV is equipped with the following two sensors: 1) a GPS sensor, which is vulnerable to spoofing attacks; 2) a well-functioning ultrawideband (UWB) sensor, which is possible to be deceived. It is shown that a covert attacker can significantly deviate the UAV's path without being detected by the UWB sensor by simultaneously corrupting the GPS signals and forging control inputs. The prerequisite for the attack occurrence is first discussed. Based on this prerequisite, an optimal attack scheme is proposed, which maximizes the deviation between the nominal destination and the real one. Correspondingly, an energy-efficient and resilient navigation scheme based on Pontryagin's maximum principle is formulated, which suppresses the above covert attacker effectively. Essentially, this problem can be seen as a Stackelberg game between a resilient path planner (defender) and a covert attacker. The effectiveness of our theoretical results is illustrated via two simulation examples.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=10036104,IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics,2023
Adversarial Blur-Deblur Network for Robust UAV Tracking,"Unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) tracking has been widely applied in real-world applications such as surveillance and monitoring. However, the inherent high maneuverability and agility of UAV often lead to motion blur, which can impair the visual appearance of the target object and easily degrade the existing trackers. To overcome this challenge, this work proposes a tracking-oriented adversarial blur-deblur network (ABDNet), composed of a novel deblurrer to recover the visual appearance of the tracked object, and a brand-new blur generator to produce realistic blurry images for adversarial training. More specifically, the deblurrer progressively refines the features through pixel-wise, spatial-wise, and channel-wise stages to achieve excellent deblurring performance. The blur generator adaptively fuses an image sequence with a learnable kernel to create realistic blurry images. During training, ABDNet is plugged into the state-of-the-art real-time trackers and trained with blurring-deblurring loss as well as tracking loss. During inference, the blur generator is removed, while the deblurrer and the tracker can work together for UAV tracking. Extensive experiments in both public datasets and real-world testing have validated the effectiveness of ABDNet.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=10015799,IEEE Robotics and Automation Letters,2023

Motion Estimation and Compensation in Automotive MIMO SAR,"With the advent of self-driving vehicles, autonomous driving systems will have to rely on a vast number of heterogeneous sensors to perform dynamic perception of the surrounding environment. Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) systems increase the resolution of conventional mass-market radars by exploiting the vehicle’s ego-motion, requiring very accurate knowledge of the trajectory, usually not compatible with automotive-grade navigation systems. In this setting, radar data are typically used to refine the navigation-based trajectory estimation with so-called autofocus algorithms. Although widely used in remote sensing applications, where the timeliness of the imaging is not an issue, autofocus in automotive scenarios calls for simple yet effective processing options to enable real-time environment imaging. This paper aims at providing a comprehensive theoretical and experimental analysis of the autofocus requirements in typical automotive scenarios. We analytically derive the effects of navigation-induced trajectory estimation errors on SAR imaging, in terms of defocusing and wrong targets’ localization. Then, we propose a motion estimation and compensation workflow tailored to automotive applications, leveraging a set of stationary Ground Control Points (GCPs) in the low-resolution radar images (before SAR focusing). We theoretically discuss the impact of the GCPs position and focusing height on SAR imaging, highlighting common pitfalls and possible countermeasures. Finally, we show the effectiveness of the proposed technique employing experimental data gathered during open road campaign by a 77 GHz multiple-input multiple-output radar mounted in a forward-looking configuration.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9945666,IEEE Transactions on Intelligent Transportation Systems,2023
A Survey on Safety-Critical Driving Scenario Generation—A Methodological Perspective,"Autonomous driving systems have witnessed significant development during the past years thanks to the advance in machine learning-enabled sensing and decision-making algorithms. One critical challenge for their massive deployment in the real world is their safety evaluation. Most existing driving systems are still trained and evaluated on naturalistic scenarios collected from daily life or heuristically-generated adversarial ones. However, the large population of cars, in general, leads to an extremely low collision rate, indicating that safety-critical scenarios are rare in the collected real-world data. Thus, methods to artificially generate scenarios become crucial to measure the risk and reduce the cost. In this survey, we focus on the algorithms of safety-critical scenario generation in autonomous driving. We first provide a comprehensive taxonomy of existing algorithms by dividing them into three categories: data-driven generation, adversarial generation, and knowledge-based generation. Then, we discuss useful tools for scenario generation, including simulation platforms and packages. Finally, we extend our discussion to five main challenges of current works– fidelity, efficiency, diversity, transferability, controllability– and research opportunities lighted up by these challenges.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=10089194,IEEE Transactions on Intelligent Transportation Systems,2023
Perceptual Interaction-Based Path Tracking Control of Autonomous Vehicles Under DoS Attacks: A Reinforcement Learning Approach,"This paper considers the distributed optimal path tracking control problem of autonomous ground vehicles (AGVs) with matched uncertainties under denial-of-service (DoS) attacks. First, to solve the uncertain system parameters, an inverse reinforcement learning (RL) technique is PROPOSED to seek the optimal controller instead of directly solving the robust control problem, which can ensure that the designed controller is globally optimal with respect to the proposal performance function. An off-policy RL algorithm is further proposed to learn the optimal control solution online without requiring any knowledge of the vehicle dynamics. Then, to lower the communication load among vehicles, a perception-based optimal resilient controller and its corresponding perception-based static deadband condition are developed, respectively. Moreover, the perception-based dynamic deadband control mechanism is further exploited to consider the secure path tracking control problem. The proposed algorithms verify that the RL-based optimal path tracking control can be solved, and the occurrence of the Zeno phenomenon can be avoided. Finally, a numerical simulation is demonstrated to verify the effectiveness of the proposed approach.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=10155261,IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology,2023
Gated Adversarial Network Based Environmental Enhancement Method for Driving Safety Under Adverse Weather Conditions,"The adverse weather conditions have brought considerable difficulties in vision-based applications, which are closely related to the driving safety of autonomous vehicles. However, to date, the greater part of the existing environmental perception studies are under ordinary conditions, and the method to deal with the adverse weather conditions was ignored. Hence, this paper proposes an all-in-one gated adversarial network (AIO-GAN) to improve the performance of vision-based environment perception algorithms under adverse weather conditions, including in rain, haze, lack of light, etc. Three key technical contributions are made. At first, the deep learning based gated transformer module was proposed to classify the input mixed images to different collections by passing them through different branches. Second, the multi-branch based variational autoencoder-generative adversarial network was proposed to solve the ill-pose problem of the solution. Third, high-level weight sharing encoders was given out to guarantee the stability and the high quality of the training process. In this way, the unified clean-style images can be achieved, even if the mixed multi-modal images are transferred from the source domain of complex weather scenes. Extensive experimental results show that the proposed method has achieved better performance than state-of-the-arts and improved the accuracy of target detection.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9677938,IEEE Transactions on Intelligent Vehicles,2023
Multi-UAV Cooperative Search Based on Reinforcement Learning With a Digital Twin Driven Training Framework,"This paper considers the cooperative search for stationary targets by multiple unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) with limited sensing range and communication ability in a dynamic threatening environment. The main purpose is to use multiple UAVs to find more unknown targets as soon as possible, increase the coverage rate of the mission area, and more importantly, guide UAVs away from threats. However, traditional search methods are mostly unscalable and perform poorly in dynamic environments. A new multi-agent deep reinforcement learning (MADRL) method, DNQMIX, is proposed in this study to solve the multi-UAV cooperative target search (MCTS) problem. The reward function is also newly designed for the MCTS problem to guide UAVs to explore and exploit the environment information more efficiently. Moreover, this paper proposes a digital twin (DT) driven training framework “centralized training, decentralized execution, and continuous evolution” (CTDECE). It can facilitate the continuous evolution of MADRL models and solve the tradeoff between training speed and environment fidelity when MADRL is applied to real-world multi-UAV systems. Simulation results show that DNQMIX outperforms state-of-art methods in terms of search rate and coverage rate.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=10045049,IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology,2023
Exploiting Multi-Modal Fusion for Urban Autonomous Driving Using Latent Deep Reinforcement Learning,"Human driving decisions are the leading cause of road fatalities. Autonomous driving naturally eliminates such incompetent decisions and thus can improve traffic safety and efficiency. Deep reinforcement learning (DRL) has shown great potential in learning complex tasks. Recently, researchers investigated various DRL-based approaches for autonomous driving. However, exploiting multi-modal fusion to generate perception and motion prediction and then leveraging these predictions to train a latent DRL has not been targeted yet. To that end, we propose enhancing urban autonomous driving using multi-modal fusion with latent DRL. A single LIDAR sensor is used to extract bird's-eye view (BEV), range view (RV), and residual input images. These images are passed into LiCaNext, a real-time multi-modal fusion network, to produce accurate joint perception and motion prediction. Next, predictions are fed with another simple BEV image into the latent DRL to learn a complex end-to-end driving policy ensuring safety, efficiency, and comfort. A sequential latent model is deployed to learn more compact representations from inputs, leading to improved sampling efficiency for reinforcement learning. Our experiments are simulated on CARLA and evaluated against state-of-the-art DRL models. Results manifest that our method learns a better driving policy that outperforms other prevailing models. Further experiments are conducted to reveal the effectiveness of our proposed approach under different environments and varying weather conditions.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9934803,IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology,2023
6G Connected Vehicle Framework to Support Intelligent Road Maintenance Using Deep Learning Data Fusion,"The growth of IoT, edge and mobile Artificial Intelligence (AI) is supporting urban authorities exploit the wealth of information collected by Connected and Autonomous Vehicles (CAV), to drive the development of transformative intelligent transport applications for addressing smart city challenges. A critical challenge is timely and efficient road infrastructure maintenance. This paper proposes an intelligent hierarchical framework for road infrastructure maintenance that exploits the latest developments in 6G communication technologies, deep learning techniques, and mobile edge AI training approaches. The proposed framework abides with the stringent requirements of training efficient machine learning applications for CAV, and is able to exploit the vast numbers of CAVs forecasted to be present on future road networks. At the core of our framework is a novel Convolution Neural Networks (CNN) model which fuses imagery and sensory data to perform pothole detection. Experiments show the proposed model can achieve state of the art performance in comparison to existing approaches while being simple, cost-effective and computationally efficient to deploy. The proposed system can form part of a federated learning framework for facilitating large scale real-time road surface condition monitoring and support adaptive resource allocation for road infrastructure maintenance.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=10021225,IEEE Transactions on Intelligent Transportation Systems,2023
DeepCar 5.0: Vehicle Make and Model Recognition Under Challenging Conditions,"Inspired by multi-agent systems (MASs) and ensemble models, a novel method of vehicle make and model recognition (VMMR) based on a vehicle’s front-view images is presented in this paper. By exploiting the attention mechanism in this work, it is demonstrated that most of the features used for classifying a vehicle are extracted from its headlight, grill, scoop, and bumper sections. These areas are designated as the regions of interest (ROIs) in our approach. Contrary to the other methods in which a whole ROI is fed to a deep convolutional neural network, in this scheme, different ROIs are extracted from each image, and then a preprocessing block and a distinctive network are designed for each ROI, which is considered as a single agent. Each agent is then trained separately, and a vehicle’s type is determined with the collaboration of these agents and based on the blackboard classification system. Also, a new dataset (DeepCar 5.0) is compiled by using the data from the top 50 automakers. This dataset contains 40,185 images of the front views and the front three-quarters of vehicles in 480 different classes, and all the parts of dataset are labeled manually. The proposed technique is able to achieve the accuracies of 92.14 and 96.72% in the automated and the manual scenarios, respectively; and contrary to the current methods, it can perform flawless classification even when just a portion of a vehicle’s front view image is available for processing. The dataset and parts of the code are available at: https://github.com/DeepCar/DeepCar5.0.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9929284,IEEE Transactions on Intelligent Transportation Systems,2023
Fuzzy-Model-Based Lateral Control for Networked Autonomous Vehicle Systems Under Hybrid Cyber-Attacks,"This article addresses the problem of lateral control problem for networked-based autonomous vehicle systems. A novel solution is presented for nonlinear autonomous vehicles to smoothly follow the planned path under external disturbances and network-induced issues, such as cyber-attacks, time delays, and limited bandwidths. First, a fuzzy-model-based system is established to represent the nonlinear networked vehicle systems subject to hybrid cyber-attacks. To reduce the network burden and effects of cyber-attacks, an asynchronous resilient event-triggered scheme (ETS) is proposed. A dynamic output-feedback control method is developed to address the underlying problem. Conditions are derived to obtain the output-feedback controller and resilient asynchronous ETS such that the closed-loop switched fuzzy system is globally exponentially stable. Examples are provided to demonstrate the effectiveness and merits of the proposed new control design techniques.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9733964,IEEE Transactions on Cybernetics,2023
Blockchain-Enabled Authenticated Key Agreement Scheme for Mobile Vehicles-Assisted Precision Agricultural IoT Networks,"Precision farming has a positive potential in the agricultural industry regarding water conservation, increased productivity, better development of rural areas, and increased income. Blockchain technology is a better alternative for storing and sharing farm data as it is reliable, transparent, immutable, and decentralized. Remote monitoring of an agricultural field requires security systems to ensure that any sensitive information is exchanged only among authenticated entities in the network. To this end, we design an efficient blockchain-enabled authenticated key agreement scheme for mobile vehicles-assisted precision agricultural Internet of Things (IoT) networks called  $AgroMobiBlock$ . The limited existing work on authentication in agricultural networks shows passive usage of blockchains with very high costs.  $AgroMobiBlock$  proposes a novel idea using the elliptic curve operations on an active hybrid blockchain over mobile farming vehicles with low computation and communication costs. Formal and informal security analysis along with the formal security verification using the Automated Validation of Internet Security Protocols and Applications (AVISPA) software tool have shown the robustness of  $AgroMobiBlock$  against man-in-the-middle, impersonation, replay, physical capture, and ephemeral secret leakage attacks among other potential attacks. The blockchain-based simulation on large-scale nodes shows the computational time for an increase in the network and block sizes. Moreover, the real-time testbed experiments have been performed to show the practical usefulness of the proposed scheme.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9994772,IEEE Transactions on Information Forensics and Security,2023
Semantic-Aware Video Compression for Automotive Cameras,"Assisted and automated driving functions in vehicles exploit sensor data to build situational awareness, however, the data amount required by these functions might exceed the bandwidth of current wired vehicle communication networks. Consequently, sensor data reduction, and automotive camera video compression need investigation. However, conventional video compression schemes, such as H.264 and H.265, have been mainly optimised for human vision. In this paper, we propose a semantic-aware (SA) video compression (SAC) framework that compresses separately and simultaneously region-of-interest and region-out-of-interest of automotive camera video frames, before transmitting them to processing unit(s), where the data are used for perception tasks, such as object detection, semantic segmentation, etc. Using our newly proposed technique, the region-of-interest (ROI), encapsulating most of the road stakeholders, retains higher quality using lower compression ratio. The experimental results show that under the same overall compression ratio, our proposed SAC scheme maintains a similar or better image quality, measured accordingly to traditional metrics and to our newly proposed semantic-aware metrics. The newly proposed metrics, namely SA-PSNR, SA-SSIM, and iIoU, give more emphasis to ROI quality, which has an immediate impact on the planning and decisions of assisted and automated driving functions. Using our SA-X264 compression, SA-PSNR and SA-SSIM have an increase of 2.864 and 0.008 respectively compared to traditional H.264, with higher ROI quality and the same compression ratio. Finally, a segmentation-based perception algorithm has been used to compare reconstructed frames, demonstrating a 2.7% mIOU improvement, when using the proposed SAC method versus traditional compression techniques.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=10103198,IEEE Transactions on Intelligent Vehicles,2023
Multitrajectory Model Predictive Control for Safe UAV Navigation in an Unknown Environment,"The problem of navigating an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) in an unknown environment is addressed with a novel model predictive control (MPC) formulation, named multitrajectory MPC (mt-MPC). The objective is to safely drive the vehicle to the desired target location by relying only on the partial description of the surroundings provided by an exteroceptive sensor. This information results in time-varying constraints during the navigation among obstacles. The proposed mt-MPC generates a sequence of position set points that are fed to control loops at lower hierarchical levels. To do so, the mt-MPC predicts two different state trajectories, a safe one and an exploiting one, in the same finite horizon optimal control problem (FHOCP). This formulation, particularly suitable for problems with uncertain time-varying constraints, allows one to partially decouple constraint satisfaction (safety) from cost function minimization (exploitation). Uncertainty due to modeling errors and sensors noise is taken into account as well, in a set membership (SM) framework. Theoretical guarantees of persistent obstacle avoidance are derived under suitable assumptions, and the approach is demonstrated experimentally out-of-the-laboratory on a prototype built with off-the-shelf components.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9938397,IEEE Transactions on Control Systems Technology,2023
Autonomous Unwrapping of General Pallets: A Novel Robot for Logistics Exploiting Contact-Based Planning,"In recent years, robotics has been largely applied to improve the efficiency of logistic processes. Pallets cover a crucial role in the logistic flow, since they represent the main way to store and ship items. When put onto pallets, the items are wrapped with plastic films to protect them and prevent them from falling. Despite being the first and necessary operation for handling the stacked goods, unwrapping—the task of removing the plastic films wrapped around the goods—has not yet been satisfactorily automated. We propose the first robotic solution for autonomous unwrapping of generally shaped pallets, including both homogeneous and heterogeneous pallets. Force and torque measurements are exploited to retrieve information on the collisions between the end-effector and the wrapped items or the plastic film. Based on the contact information, we design a novel reactive planning strategy that makes the unwrapping task effective and robust on pallets with uncertain position or shape. We present the results of an extensive experimental campaign to validate the proposed method. Note to Practitioners—This work is motivated by the fact that unwrapping machines are not yet common on the market. The few commercial examples are usually bulky machines that lack the flexibility to adapt to different and irregularly shaped pallets. Thus, the crucial operation of removing the plastic film around palletized goods is still mainly performed by hand. Blade handling, ladders, and electrostatic shocks are sources of potential injury. We propose a flexible, autonomous unwrapping robot suitable for both cuboid and irregularly shaped pallets. The robot is composed of a robotic arm, a custom cutting end-effector, a vision module, and a suitable planning and control unit. The reduced dimensions allow it to be mounted on a mobile base. The robot has been successfully tested on different pallet configurations. However, extensive testing in real-world scenarios should be carried out to assess both reliability and time efficiency in more realistic working conditions. Moreover, real pallets can reach considerable heights. Thus, a prismatic joint should be integrated to address such cases. Finally, unwrapping in the presence of typical plastic straps and different types of film, e.g., the shrink one, is to be evaluated.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9801631,IEEE Transactions on Automation Science and Engineering,2023
Advances in Line-of-Sight Guidance for Path Following of Autonomous Marine Vehicles: An Overview,"Autonomous marine vehicles (AMVs), including autonomous surface and underwater vehicles, are versatile means to explore, exploit, monitor, and protect marine resources and environments. Motion control is a fundamental enabling technique for state-of-the-art AMV development. Especially, guidance is a critical component in AMV motion control. In recent years, line-of-sight (LOS) guidance, as an efficient guidance method, has attracted tremendous interest from both theoretical and practical perspectives. In this paper, an overview of recent advances in LOS guidance for AMV path following is provided. First, a control objective for the path following of an AMV with a kinematic model is specified. Next, major LOS guidance laws for path following are reviewed in detail. Then, LOS guidance laws applicable to coordinated path following of multiple AMVs are elaborated.

A Protocol for Reliable Real-Time Wireless Communication of Large Data Samples,"In this article, we present a middleware protocol, that transmits larger-than-a-frame data samples within application real-time and reliability requirements over a lossy wireless channel. The protocol efficiently deploys an intelligent retransmission control that exploits the extended deadline requirements of a sample for frame-level scheduling. The transmission of such samples is placed in the context of the necessary integration of such external sensor data into the decision-making process of an autonomous vehicle. Therefore, we provide parameterization and access rules for communication links in resource-managed scenarios and lay out how to integrate the protocol into the popular DDS middleware. The performance of the parameterized links to satisfy their reliability requirements is studied and compared to error protection protocols in the current software stack. We base the evaluation on an OMNeT++ simulation, whereby an established wireless error model is used. The use case is placed in the context of collaborative sensing in a valet parking environment, where external infrastructure sensor data augments the autonomous vehicle's data processing chain via a lossy wireless link. Thereby, the use case adheres to the underlying safety requirements. Results show that if the protocol's awareness of the application requirements is used for parameterization, guarantees for reliability can be provided that outperform existing solutions.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=10123001,IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology,2023
An Accurate UAV 3-D Path Planning Method for Disaster Emergency Response Based on an Improved Multiobjective Swarm Intelligence Algorithm,"Planning a practical three-dimensional (3-D) flight path for unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) is a key challenge for the follow-up management and decision making in disaster emergency response. The ideal flight path is expected to balance the total flight path length and the terrain threat, to shorten the flight time and reduce the possibility of collision. However, in the traditional methods, the tradeoff between these concerns is difficult to achieve, and practical constraints are lacking in the optimized objective functions, which leads to inaccurate modeling. In addition, the traditional methods based on gradient optimization lack an accurate optimization capability in the complex multimodal objective space, resulting in a nonoptimal path. Thus, in this article, an accurate UAV 3-D path planning approach in accordance with an enhanced multiobjective swarm intelligence algorithm is proposed (APPMS). In the APPMS method, the path planning mission is converted into a multiobjective optimization task with multiple constraints, and the objectives based on the total flight path length and degree of terrain threat are simultaneously optimized. In addition, to obtain the optimal UAV 3-D flight path, an accurate swarm intelligence search approach based on improved ant colony optimization is introduced, which can improve the global and local search capabilities by using the preferred search direction and random neighborhood search mechanism. The effectiveness of the proposed APPMS method was demonstrated in three groups of simulated experiments with different degrees of terrain threat, and a real-data experiment with 3-D terrain data from an actual emergency situation.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9780258,IEEE Transactions on Cybernetics,2023
End-to-End Autonomous Driving With Semantic Depth Cloud Mapping and Multi-Agent,"Focusing on the task of point-to-point navigation for an autonomous driving vehicle, we propose a novel deep learning model trained with end-to-end and multi-task learning manners to perform both perception and control tasks simultaneously. The model is used to drive the ego vehicle safely by following a sequence of routes defined by the global planner. The perception part of the model is used to encode high-dimensional observation data provided by an RGBD camera while performing semantic segmentation, semantic depth cloud (SDC) mapping, and traffic light state and stop sign prediction. Then, the control part decodes the encoded features along with additional information provided by GPS and speedometer to predict waypoints that come with a latent feature space. Furthermore, two agents are employed to process these outputs and make a control policy that determines the level of steering, throttle, and brake as the final action. The model is evaluated on CARLA simulator with various scenarios made of normal-adversarial situations and different weathers to mimic real-world conditions. In addition, we do a comparative study with some recent models to justify the performance in multiple aspects of driving. Moreover, we also conduct an ablation study on SDC mapping and multi-agent to understand their roles and behavior. As a result, our model achieves the highest driving score even with fewer parameters and computation load. To support future studies, we share our codes at https://github.com/oskarnatan/end-to-end-driving.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9802907,IEEE Transactions on Intelligent Vehicles,2023
Deep Learning-Based Trajectory Planning and Control for Autonomous Ground Vehicle Parking Maneuver,"In this paper, a novel integrated real-time trajectory planning and tracking control framework capable of dealing with autonomous ground vehicle (AGV) parking maneuver problems is presented. In the motion planning component, a newly-proposed idea of utilizing deep neural networks (DNNs) for approximating optimal parking trajectories is further extended by taking advantages of a recurrent network structure. The main aim is to fully exploit the inherent relationships between different vehicle states in the training process. Furthermore, two transfer learning strategies are applied such that the developed motion planner can be adapted to suit various AGVs. In order to follow the planned maneuver trajectory, an adaptive learning tracking control algorithm is designed and served as the motion controller. By adapting the network parameters, the stability of the proposed control scheme, along with the convergence of tracking errors, can be theoretically guaranteed. In order to validate the effectiveness and emphasize key features of our proposal, a number of experimental studies and comparative analysis were executed. The obtained results reveal that the proposed strategy can enable the AGV to fulfill the parking mission with enhanced motion planning and control performance. Note to Practitioners—This article was motivated by the problem of optimal automatic parking planning and tracking control for autonomous ground vehicles (AGVs) maneuvering in a restricted environment (e.g., constrained parking regions). A number of challenges may arise when dealing with this problem (e.g., the model uncertainties involved in the vehicle dynamics, system variable limits, and the presence of external disturbances). Existing approaches to address such a problem usually exploit the merit of optimization-based planning/control techniques such as model predictive control and dynamic programming in order for an optimal solution. However, two practical issues may require further considerations: 1). The nonlinear (re)optimization process tends to consume a large amount of computing power and it might not be affordable in real-time; 2). Existing motion planning and control algorithms might not be easily adapted to suit various types of AGVs. To overcome the aforementioned issues, we present an idea of utilizing the recurrent deep neural network (RDNN) for planning optimal parking maneuver trajectories and an adaptive learning NN-based (ALNN) control scheme for robust trajectory tracking. In addition, by introducing two transfer learning strategies, the proposed RDNN motion planner can be adapted to suit different AGVs. In our follow-up research, we will explore the possibility of extending the developed methodology for large-scale AGV parking systems collaboratively operating in a more complex cluttered environment.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9805687,IEEE Transactions on Automation Science and Engineering,2023
Deep Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning for Highway On-Ramp Merging in Mixed Traffic,"On-ramp merging is a challenging task for autonomous vehicles (AVs), especially in mixed traffic where AVs coexist with human-driven vehicles (HDVs). In this paper, we formulate the mixed-traffic highway on-ramp merging problem as a multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) problem, where the AVs (on both merge lane and through lane) collaboratively learn a policy to adapt to HDVs to maximize the traffic throughput. We develop an efficient and scalable MARL framework that can be used in dynamic traffic where the communication topology could be time-varying. Parameter sharing and local rewards are exploited to foster inter-agent cooperation while achieving great scalability. An action masking scheme is employed to improve learning efficiency by filtering out invalid/unsafe actions at each step. In addition, a novel priority-based safety supervisor is developed to significantly reduce collision rate and greatly expedite the training process. A gym-like simulation environment is developed and open-sourced with three different levels of traffic densities. We exploit curriculum learning to efficiently learn harder tasks from trained models under simpler settings. Comprehensive experimental results show the proposed MARL framework consistently outperforms several state-of-the-art benchmarks.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=10159552,IEEE Transactions on Intelligent Transportation Systems,2023
A Learning-Based Nonlinear Model Predictive Controller for a Real Go-Kart Based on Black-Box Dynamics Modeling Through Gaussian Processes,"Lately, nonlinear model predictive control (NMPC) has been successfully applied to (semi-) autonomous driving problems and has proven to be a very promising technique. However, accurate control models for real vehicles could require costly and time-demanding specific measurements. To address this problem, the exploitation of system data to complement or derive the prediction model of the NMPC has been explored, employing learning dynamics approaches within learning-based NMPC (LbNMPC). Its application to the automotive field has focused on discrete gray-box modeling, in which a nominal dynamics model is enhanced by the data-driven component. In this manuscript, we present an LbNMPC controller for a real go-kart based on a continuous black-box model of the accelerations obtained by Gaussian processes (GP). We show the effectiveness of the proposed approach by testing the controller on a real go-kart vehicle, highlighting the approximation steps required to get an exploitable GP model on a real-time application.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=10185938,IEEE Transactions on Control Systems Technology,2023
AST-SafeSec: Adaptive Stress Testing for Safety and Security Co-Analysis of Cyber-Physical Systems,"Cyber-physical systems are becoming more intelligent with the adoption of heterogeneous sensor networks and machine learning capabilities that deal with an increasing amount of input data. While this complexity aims to solve problems in various domains, it adds new challenges for the system assurance. One issue is the rise in the number of abnormal behaviors that affect system performance due to possible sensor faults and attacks. The combination of safety risks, which are usually caused by random sensor faults and security risks that can happen during any random system state, makes the full coverage testing of the cyber-physical system challenging. Existing techniques are inadequate to deal with complex safety and security co-risks against cyber-physical systems. In this paper, we propose AST-SafeSec, an analysis methodology for both safety and security aspects that utilizes reinforcement learning to identify the most likely adversarial paths at various normal or failure states of a cyber-physical system that can influence system behavior through its sensor data. The methodology is evaluated using an autonomous vehicle scenario by incorporating a security attack into the stochastic sensor elements of a vehicle. Evaluation results show that the methodology analyzes the interaction of malicious attacks with random faults and identifies the incident caused by the interactions and the most likely path that leads to the incident.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=10231138,IEEE Transactions on Information Forensics and Security,2023
In-Vehicle CAN Bus Tampering Attacks Detection for Connected and Autonomous Vehicles Using an Improved Isolation Forest Method,"The development and applications of mobile communication technologies in intelligent autonomous transportation systems have led to an extraordinary rise in the mount of connected and autonomous vehicles (CAVs). Ensuring the security of in-vehicle communication data is the basis for the safety of cooperative transportation systems. An in-vehicle controller area network (CAN) bus is an important issue in in-vehicle security, and some hackers have mastered remote vehicle control methods through the CAN bus network. This paper proposes an improved isolation forest method with data mass (MS-iForest) for data tampering attack detection, in which we use data mass instead of the number of divisions and give an anomaly score ranking to quantify the degree of anomalies. This method is promising to be used as part of the intrusion detection system, like a security component in the onboard gateway, which can effectively avoid the data tampering attacks. We compare the proposed method with other anomaly detection schemes based on the data collected from an in-vehicle simulated dataset and two standard datasets. The experiment results show that the proposed method performs better than the other anomaly detection schemes in terms of the area under the receiver operating curve (AUC).",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9652038,IEEE Transactions on Intelligent Transportation Systems,2023
Resilient and Safe Platooning Control of Connected Automated Vehicles Against Intermittent Denial-of-Service Attacks,"Connected automated vehicles (CAVs) serve as a promising enabler for future intelligent transportation systems because of their capabilities in improving traffic efficiency and driving safety, and reducing fuel consumption and vehicle emissions. A fundamental issue in CAVs is platooning control that empowers a convoy of CAVs to be cooperatively maneuvered with desired longitudinal spacings and identical velocities on roads. This paper addresses the issue of resilient and safe platooning control of CAVs subject to intermittent denial-of-service (DoS) attacks that disrupt vehicle-to-vehicle communications. First, a heterogeneous and uncertain vehicle longitudinal dynamic model is presented to accommodate a variety of uncertainties, including diverse vehicle masses and engine inertial delays, unknown and nonlinear resistance forces, and a dynamic platoon leader. Then, a resilient and safe distributed longitudinal platooning control law is constructed with an aim to preserve simultaneous individual vehicle stability, attack resilience, platoon safety and scalability. Furthermore, a numerically efficient offline design algorithm for determining the desired platoon control law is developed, under which the platoon resilience against DoS attacks can be maximized but the anticipated stability, safety and scalability requirements remain preserved. Finally, extensive numerical experiments are provided to substantiate the efficacy of the proposed platooning method.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9878288,IEEE/CAA Journal of Automatica Sinica,2023
Multi-Modal Sensor Fusion and Object Tracking for Autonomous Racing,"Reliable detection and tracking of surrounding objects are indispensable for comprehensive motion prediction and planning of autonomous vehicles. Due to the limitations of individual sensors, the fusion of multiple sensor modalities is required to improve the overall detection capabilities. Additionally, robust motion tracking is essential for reducing the effect of sensor noise and improving state estimation accuracy. The reliability of the autonomous vehicle software becomes even more relevant in complex, adversarial high-speed scenarios at the vehicle handling limits in autonomous racing. In this paper, we present a modular multi-modal sensor fusion and tracking method for high-speed applications. The method is based on the Extended Kalman Filter (EKF) and is capable of fusing heterogeneous detection inputs to track surrounding objects consistently.

It is the first fusion and tracking method validated in high-speed real-world scenarios at the Indy Autonomous Challenge 2021 and the Autonomous Challenge at CES (AC@CES) 2022, proving its robustness and computational efficiency on embedded systems. It does not require any labeled data and achieves position tracking residuals below 0.1 m.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=10113239,IEEE Transactions on Intelligent Vehicles,2023
A Survey on Joint-Operation Application for Unmanned Swarm Formations Under a Complex Confrontation Environment,"With the rapid development of informatization, autonomy and intelligence, unmanned swarm formation intelligent operations will become the main combat mode of future wars. Typical unmanned swarm formations such as ground-based directed energy weapon formations, space-based kinetic energy weapon formations, and sea-based carrier-based formations have become the trump card for winning future wars.

A Defensive Strategy Against Beam Training Attack in 5G mmWave Networks for Manufacturing,"Millimeter-wave (mmWave) carriers are an essential building block of fifth-generation (5G) systems. Satisfactory performance of the communications over the mmWave spectrum requires an alignment between the signal beam of the transmitter and receiver, achieved via beam training protocols. Nevertheless, beam training is vulnerable to jamming attacks, where the attacker intends to send jamming signals over different spatial directions to confuse legitimate nodes. This paper focuses on defending against this attack in smart factories where a moving Automated Guided Vehicle (AGV) communicates with a base station via a mmWave carrier. We introduce a defensive strategy to cope with jamming attacks, including two stages: jamming detection and jamming mitigation. Developed based on autoencoders, both algorithms can learn the characteristics/features of the received signals at the AGV. They can be employed consecutively before performing the downlink data transmission. In particular, once a jamming attack is identified, the jamming mitigation can be utilized to retrieve the corrupted received signal strength vector, allowing a better decision during the beam training operation. In addition, the proposed algorithm is straightforward and fully compliant with the existing beam training protocols in 5G New Radio. The numerical results show that not only the proposed defensive strategy can capture more than 80% of attack events, but it also improves the average signal-to-interference-plus-noise-ratio significantly, i.e., up to 15 dB.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=10093907,IEEE Transactions on Information Forensics and Security,2023

Autonomous Vehicles Security: Challenges and Solutions Using Blockchain and Artificial Intelligence,"The arrival of autonomous vehicles (AVs) promises many great benefits, including increased safety and reduced energy consumption, pollution, and congestion. However, these engines have many security and privacy issues that could undermine the expected benefits if not addressed. AVs will provide new opportunities for hackers to carry out malicious attacks, posing a great threat to the future of mobility and data protection. The research trend in this field indicates that combining Blockchain and AI could bring strong protection for AVs against malicious attacks. Blockchain and AI have different working paradigms, but when merged, they can empower each other, and solve many security and privacy issues of AVs. AI can optimise the construction of the Blockchain to make it more efficient, secure and energy-saving, where Blockchain provides data immutability and trust mechanism for AI-based solutions and makes them more transparent, trustful, and explainable. Although some research is being conducted on this area, the topic of applying Blockchain and AI for securing AVs is not deeply investigated. In this paper, we explore the possible application of an amalgamation of Blockchain and AI solutions for securing AVs. We first introduce a classification of security and privacy threats that may arise from the application of AVs. Then, we provide an overview of recent literature regarding Blockchain and AI usage for securing AVs. Finally, we highlight limitations and challenges that may face the integration of Blockchain and AI with AVs based on our systemic review and suggest potential future directions for research in this field.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=10023964,IEEE Transactions on Intelligent Transportation Systems,2023
Resilient Event-Triggered Control of Connected Automated Vehicles Under Cyber Attacks,"Dear Editor, This letter contributes to designing a resilient event-triggered controller for connected automated vehicles under cyber attacks, including denial-of-service (DoS) and deception attacks. To characterize the effect of DoS attacks, the effective intervals of the attack are redivided based on the sampling period. Then, a resilient distributed event-triggering mechanism is proposed to compensate for the sabotage of DoS attacks and reduce the amount of transmitted data. Since the communication channel transmits the data only at the trigger instant, deception attacks may occur at this instant and be transmitted to each vehicle in superposition with the normal signal. Therefore, we construct stochastic models satisfying Bernoulli distribution to describe the false information injected by the attackers. Based on the above framework, an attack-resilient control strategy is proposed to resist the impact of cyber attacks. Then, sufficient conditions are established to achieve stability of vehicular platoons, and a co-design strategy regarding the control gain and triggering parameter matrices is given. Finally, the simulation results are provided to substantiate the effectiveness of the proposed method.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=10084420,IEEE/CAA Journal of Automatica Sinica,2023
Achieving Physical Layer Security Against Location Unknown Eavesdroppers via Friendly Jammer,"Dear Editor, This letter is concerning friendly jamming unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) to assist in the safe communication of UAV base stations. Due to the openness of UAV wireless communication, it is vulnerable to attacks leading to information disclosure or blockage. To address this issue, friendly jamming UAVs can assist UAV base stations and improve the security of wireless communications. This letter introduces a dual UAV system that consists of a source UAV (S-UAV) and a friendly jamming UAV (J-UAV). We construct an optimization problem to maximize the security region under physical constraints, which is non-convex and complicated. Security region (SR) is proposed for assessing the security performance of the whole system.

Editorial: Secure and Safe MetaControl for Cyber Physical Systems,"Welcome to the twelfth issue of 2023 in the IEEE/CAA Journal of Automatica Sinica (JAS). In the sixth issue of 2023, I systematically addressed the latest development of Meta Vehicles, and sorted out some important contributions published in the IEEE/CAA JAS focusing on control, estimation, and optimization of automated vehicles with reliability, security, efficiency, and intelligence. When shifting the perspective to cyber-physical systems (CPSs), the styles or paradigms of control and filtering are going through major changes benefiting from the widespread applications of both cloud computing and digital twins. Particularly, the desired performance and management functions of CPSs under the virtual and real framework will be achieved via Metaverse technologies and strict system analysis involving behavior recognition of users, decision-making processes as well as parameter design and optimization. It is evident that the system's performance and cost are synthetic reflections of its behavior in both cyberspace and the real world [1]. This kind of control paradigm can be referred to as MetaControl [2]. It should be pointed out that MetaControl is built upon cyberspace and hence security threats are naturally inherited and inevitably enhanced due to the ever-increasing complexity and diversity of system functionalities while faults in the physical space are also a big concern. As such, new methods of control, filtering, and optimization should be creatively developed to satisfy the requirement of external security in cyberspace and internal safety in the physical space of CPSs.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=10302458,IEEE/CAA Journal of Automatica Sinica,2023

Fixed-Time Resilient Edge-Triggered Estimation and Control of Surface Vehicles for Cooperative Target Tracking Under Attacks,"This paper is concerned with the cooperative target tracking of under-actuated unmanned surface vehicles (USVs) with event-triggered communications subject to denial-of-service (DoS) attacks. The target position information can be sensed by a fraction of follower USVs only. A fixed-time resilient cooperative edge-triggered estimation and control architecture is presented for achieving cooperative target tracking under DoS attacks. Specifically, a distributed edge-triggered fixed-time extended state observer (ESO) is designed to recover the position and velocity of the target with a prescribed time regardless of the unreliable communication network subject to DoS attacks. Moreover, the communication burden of the network is reduced by the proposed edge-triggered mechanism. In the control law design, a fixed-time ESO is designed for estimating the model uncertainties and external disturbances in an earth-fixed reference frame. Then, a fixed-time target tracking control law is proposed for each follower USV based on the fixed-time ESO. It is proven that the error signals in the closed-loop control system of USVs are convergent to the origin in a fixed time. An example is provided to substantiate the effectiveness of the proposed fixed-time resilient cooperative edge-triggered estimation and control architecture for USVs.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9799547,IEEE Transactions on Intelligent Vehicles,2023
Data Freshness Optimization Under CAA in the UAV-Aided MECN: A Potential Game Perspective,"As a promising enabler for edge intelligence, Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAV) have become more and more important in Mobile Edge Computing Networks (MECN), such as communication, computation, collection and control service supply. Although Age of Information (AoI) minimization is indispensable for fresh information collection and computation in the UAV-aided MECN, some attackers can launch attacks to deteriorate the availability of precious channel resources, such as revealed channel access attacks (CAAs). Moreover, recent research has not considered the system’s active probability and security issues concurrently, e.g., CAA, in the average AoI minimization process. In this paper, to deal with this problem, we consider an AoI-oriented channel access problem under CAA with a game theory viewpoint. Firstly, to obtain a MECN-based AoI indicator under CAA, the system model with active probability consideration is established. Next, the channel access-based AoI minimization problem is formulated from the viewpoint of the Ordinary Potential Game (OPG). Furthermore, two algorithms called AACSD and DCASD are proposed to determine channel access strategies, by which the Nash Equilibrium (NE) solution of the OPG could be reached. Finally, experiments are conducted under homogeneous and heterogeneous parameter settings, and the simulation results evaluate the correctness and effectiveness of our proposals.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9762890,IEEE Transactions on Intelligent Transportation Systems,2023
Non-Conservative Trajectory Planning for Automated Vehicles by Estimating Intentions of Dynamic Obstacles,"Motion planning algorithms for urban automated driving must handle uncertainty due to unknown intention and future motion of Dynamic Obstacles (DOs). Considering a single future trajectory for each DO is not adequate, especially in urban frameworks where traffic participants exhibit very different behaviors. However, including multiple candidate trajectories representing different behaviors results in an excess of conservatism. We present a novel combination of the Interactive Multiple Model (IMM) algorithm and Stochastic Model Predictive Control (SMPC) that allows non-conservative safe motion planning in presence of DOs with unknown intention. We introduce a framework based on LQR and IMM to predict multiple candidate future trajectories, each interpreted as a high-level intention that the DO is pursuing, and dynamically estimate their probabilities. Then, the future trajectory of the automated vehicle is iteratively planned in an SMPC fashion, in which collision avoidance constraints are generated for multiple future trajectories of each DO, with a focus on the most likely. Our method improves safe motion planning fully exploiting the benefits of multi-modal predictions of the DOs, avoiding excessive conservatism. Advantages of the proposed method are discussed through simulations in the CARLA environment.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=10005857,IEEE Transactions on Intelligent Vehicles,2023
Safety-Critical and Flexible Cooperative On-Ramp Merging Control of Connected and Automated Vehicles in Mixed Traffic,"Cooperative on-ramp merging control for connected and automated vehicles (CAVs) can effectively improve traffic throughput and vehicle fuel efficiency at highway on-ramp merging bottlenecks. However, in the mixed traffic scenario where CAVs and human-driven vehicles (HDVs) coexist, the uncertain maneuvers of human drivers pose a major challenge to merging control in terms of safety and flexibility. To this end, this paper proposes a hierarchical cooperative on-ramp merging control strategy for CAVs to optimize flexible trajectories with safety guarantees in mixed traffic. First, the on-ramp merging control problem for CAVs is considered in the case of a three-vehicle coordination, resulting in an optimal control problem (OCP) coordinating on-ramp and main-lane CAVs for efficient operation while satisfying multiple safety-critical constraints. Second, a two-level hierarchical control architecture is developed to solve the OCP with mixed state-control constraints. The upper-level planner solves an unconstrained OCP with Pontryagin’s Minimum Principle to calculate an expected merging position, which is embedded in the variable time headway of safe merging constraints in the lower-level controller. Then, the controller converts the nonlinear OCP with safety-critical constraints to a quadratic programing (QP) problem by exploiting Control Barrier Functions (CBFs) and Control Lyapunov Functions (CLFs). By solving the QP efficiently, the time and energy efficient trajectory for each CAV is obtained. In addition, a receding horizon control framework is employed, which enables CAVs to determine flexible merging opportunity and tackle the disturbances caused by HDVs. Finally, comprehensive simulation results show that the proposed cooperative on-ramp merging strategy has potential in enabling merging flexibility, improving traffic efficiency and energy economy in real time.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=10053376,IEEE Transactions on Intelligent Transportation Systems,2023
An Analytical Latency Model and Evaluation of the Capacity of 5G NR to Support V2X Services Using V2N2V Communications,"5G has been designed to support applications such as connected and automated driving. To this aim, 5G includes a highly flexible New Radio (NR) interface that can be configured to utilize different subcarrier spacings (SCS), slot durations, scheduling, and retransmissions mechanisms. This flexibility can be exploited to support advanced V2X services with strict latency and reliability requirements using V2N2V (Vehicle-to-Network-to-Vehicles) communications instead of direct or sidelink V2V (Vehicle-to-Vehicle). To analyze this possibility, this paper presents a novel analytical model that estimates the latency of 5G at the radio network level. The model accounts for the use of different numerologies (SCS, slot durations and Cyclic Prefixes), modulation and coding schemes, full-slots or mini-slots, semi-static and dynamic scheduling, different retransmission mechanisms, and broadcast/multicast or unicast transmissions. The model has been used to first analyze the impact of different 5G NR radio configurations on the latency. We then identify which radio configurations and scenarios can 5G NR satisfy the latency and reliability requirements of V2X services using V2N2V communications. This paper considers cooperative lane changes as a case study. The results show that 5G can support advanced V2X services at the radio network level using V2N2V communications under certain conditions that depend on the radio configuration, bandwidth, service requirements and cell traffic load.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9897006,IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology,2023
Automatic Vehicle Pollution Detection Using Feedback Based Iterative Deep Learning,"Air pollution is one of the major health hazards in modern times. Vehicle pollution is one of the major contributors to aerial contamination. Significant emphasis has been given by the researchers to identify the traffic pollutant sources. However, there is a need for a low-cost, automated solution for fast detection of polluting vehicles from the end of law enforcers. In this article, we have presented a novel deep learning based evaluation strategy that will identify the pollutant vehicle through on- road installed surveillance camera images. An enhanced image data set with notable variations has been prepared for training the models. Thereafter, a multi-model feedback process has been integrated. In contrast to the other deep learning approaches, the proposed framework has started with low labeled training data which is quite relevant in real-life scenarios. Subsequently, the size of the training samples has been increased using feedback. The evaluation of the framework has been performed with seven popular deep learning CNN models, i.e Inception-V3, MobileNet-V2, MobileNet-V3 (small), InceptionResNet-V2, VGG16, VGG19 and XceptionNet. Transfer learning has been exploited to distinguish the on- road pollutants and to provide proper surveillance in transport system. We have compared our method with recent state-of-the-art techniques. The results have demonstrated the superiority of the proposed framework in the road surveillance domain. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first attempt to apply a feedback based iterative deep learning model for vehicle pollution detection.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=10034426,IEEE Transactions on Intelligent Transportation Systems,2023
Road Shape Classification-Based Matching Between Lane Detection and HD Map for Robust Localization of Autonomous Cars,"Many map matching-based localization algorithms estimate the autonomous car's pose using a registration between lanes measured by a camera and the High-Definition (HD) map. However, the registration methods based on numerical optimization, such as the Iterative Closest Point (ICP) and Normal Distributions Transform (NDT), can cause underdetermined problems due to no unique solution when matching under-constrained lane shapes such as straight lines and circular arcs. This paper proposes a robust localization algorithm with centimeter-level accuracy by applying different matching techniques depending on the road shape. We proposed a road shape classification-based map matching algorithm to overcome the under-constrained problems, which have no unique solution due to insufficient constraints. The proposed algorithm classifies lane segments into line, arc, and clothoid curves considering their curvature characteristics. After that, we find correction information through a map matching and covariance estimation method using lane pairs with the same type of their shape. For the under-constrained shapes, the geometry-based map-matching algorithm and covariance estimation method are applied to avoid underdetermined results. Finally, the measurement calculated from the correction information and predicted pose of the ego-vehicle is exploited for the measurement update of the Extended Kalman Filter (EKF). The proposed method was quantitatively evaluated in the simulation environment, which contains various road shapes, and qualitatively validated for experimental data from an autonomous driving platform. The proposed algorithm shows more robust matching capability, efficient computation time, and higher accuracy than the localization system based on ICP-based lane matching.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9940999,IEEE Transactions on Intelligent Vehicles,2023
Resilient Countermeasures Against Cyber-Attacks on Self-Driving Car Architecture,"Self-driving cars, believed to be on track to become a seven trillion-dollar industry by 2050, are likely to be a popular mode of transportation in the near future, as the technology promises safety and efficiency. Significant advances have been made to achieve these objectives. However, the idea of a self-driving car completing its goals without human intervention in the presence of uncertainties is still posed with challenges. These challenges mostly relate to decision-making under uncertainties that could arise from transient faults or deliberate attempts to disrupt the system in favor of adversarial motives. Traditional schemes of hardening the system against known compromises will not suffice primarily because of the sophistication adversarial attempts have come to achieve and the rate at which new attacks are being devised. The problem demands a solution that is resilient to attacks and that would allow a self-driving vehicle to complete its designated task in the presence of attacks or faults. Several attempts have been made towards achieving resilience in autonomous vehicles. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work to give a thorough review on the resilient approaches adopted in the context and presents a taxonomy of such approaches. The paper also includes a brief introduction to the architecture of self-driving vehicles and its vulnerabilities in the presented context. This paper also discusses a novel approach using N-version programming for resilience.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=10168308,IEEE Transactions on Intelligent Transportation Systems,2023
WKN-OC: A New Deep Learning Method for Anomaly Detection in Intelligent Vehicles,"Connected and automated vehicles (CAVs) play a vital role in transforming human mobility, tackling road congestion and road safety. However, CAVs rely heavily on the security, accuracy, and stability of sensor readings and network data. Abnormal sensor readings caused by malicious cyberattacks or faulty car sensors can have devastating consequences, possibly even lead to a fatal crash. In order to avoid the CAVs data anomalies caused by network attacks or data failures, we propose a Wavelet Kernel Network with Omni-Scale Convolutional (WKN-OC) for anomaly detection in intelligent transportation systems (ITS), which can select the optimal scale adaptively and processes high-frequency signals better. The proposed method pays more attention to the high-frequency components of input data, and fully extracts valuable features through the feature extraction framework, so that the model has strong anomaly detection performance. We verify the reliability of the WKN-OC method on the Safe Pilot Model Deployment (SPMD) data set. It is shown that the proposed WKN-OC model has good detection performance for various anomaly data, especially in the mixed anomaly experiment. We have achieved 96.78% average accuracy in mixed anomaly experiments and 96.13% accuracy in multi anomaly experiments. The results show that the model has strong generalization performance for the anomaly detection problem faced by the Internet of Vehicles (IoVs) and can identify the unknown anomalies in reality well.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=10041752,IEEE Transactions on Intelligent Vehicles,2023
Time-Driven and Privacy-Preserving Navigation Model for Vehicle-to-Vehicle Communication Systems,"Effective time-driven navigation is an operative way to alleviate traffic congestion, which is also a challenging problem in the Internet of Vehicles context. Most existing centralized navigation systems often cannot react promptly to real-time local traffic situations, while most existing distributed navigation systems are vulnerable to privacy attacks. To overcome these drawbacks, we propose a learning model that provides a provable guarantee of vehicles' privacy while still enabling efficient navigation under real-time traffic conditions. The proposed model adopts a novel multi-agent system with customized differentially private mechanisms. To verify the effectiveness and stability of our approach, we implement the proposed method on CARLA, which is an autonomous driving simulator. In four experimental tasks with varying parameters, we demonstrate fully that our proposed method outperforms other benchmarks.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=10052728,IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology,2023
Robust Lane Change Decision Making for Autonomous Vehicles: An Observation Adversarial Reinforcement Learning Approach,"Reinforcementlearning holds the promise of allowing autonomous vehicles to learn complex decision making behaviors through interacting with other traffic participants. However, many real-world driving tasks involve unpredictable perception errors or measurement noises which may mislead an autonomous vehicle into making unsafe decisions, even cause catastrophic failures. In light of these risks, to ensure safety under perception uncertainty, autonomous vehicles are required to be able to cope with the worst case observation perturbations. Therefore, this paper proposes a novel observation adversarial reinforcement learning approach for robust lane change decision making of autonomous vehicles. A constrained observation-robust Markov decision process is presented to model lane change decision making behaviors of autonomous vehicles under policy constraints and observation uncertainties. Meanwhile, a black-box attack technique based on Bayesian optimization is implemented to approximate the optimal adversarial observation perturbations efficiently. Furthermore, a constrained observation-robust actor-critic algorithm is advanced to optimize autonomous driving lane change policies while keeping the variations of the policies attacked by the optimal adversarial observation perturbations within bounds. Finally, the robust lane change decision making approach is evaluated in three stochastic mixed traffic flows based on different densities. The results demonstrate that the proposed method can not only enhance the performance of an autonomous vehicle but also improve the robustness of lane change policies against adversarial observation perturbations.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9750867,IEEE Transactions on Intelligent Vehicles,2023
Learning When to Use Adaptive Adversarial Image Perturbations Against Autonomous Vehicles,"Deep neural network (DNN) models are widely used in autonomous vehicles for object detection using camera images. However, these models are vulnerable to adversarial image perturbations. Existing methods for generating these perturbations use the image frame as the decision variable, resulting in a computationally expensive optimization process that starts over for each new image. Few approaches have been developed for attacking online image streams while considering the physical dynamics of autonomous vehicles, their mission, and the environment. To address these challenges, we propose a multi-level stochastic optimization framework that monitors the attacker's capability to generate adversarial perturbations. Our framework introduces a binary decision attack/not attack based on the attacker's capability level to enhance its effectiveness. We evaluate our proposed framework using simulations for vision-guided autonomous vehicles and actual tests with a small indoor drone in an office environment. Our results demonstrate that our method is capable of generating real-time image attacks while monitoring the attacker's proficiency given state estimates.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=10138012,IEEE Robotics and Automation Letters,2023
Hawk-Pigeon Game Tactics for Unmanned Aerial Vehicle Swarm Target Defense,"Unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) swarm target defense is a crucial and practical issue about group decision-making and cooperative control in multiagent systems. Hawk-pigeon game architecture is presented in this article to guide UAV swarm target defense. Firstly, a 6-degree-of-freedom UAV model is employed, and the control command converter is derived, which could be widely used in the transformation from the second-order integrator model to the 6-DOF UAV model. Moreover, the attack tactics and pursuit strategies of the defender UAVs are proposed inspired by the hawk's hunting mechanism, and the dynamic model of the attacker UAVs is formulated inspired by pigeon group homing behavior. Furthermore, the victory zone of the hawk-pigeon game is analyzed using the time of interception and explicitly exhibited in isochrones means. The proposed method is scalable and adaptive, adopting distributed decision-making to support large-scale UAV swarm engagement.

Distributed Subspace Projection Graph Signal Estimation With Anomaly Interference,"The estimation of graph signal is a vital problem in many distributed networks, such as vehicular networks, smart grids, unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), and the Internet of Things. In those networks, anomaly interference widely exists, such as network attack, noise, device fault, which will hazard the healthy of the entire system. In the article, the estimation of graph signals with anomaly interference is investigated. We show that the graph signal estimation problem can be treated as a bandlimited subspace optimization problem, and propose a distributed subspace projection graph signal estimation algorithm based on the graph filter (DispGF), which can achieve better performance with less communication burden. In addition, a graph filter matrix that produces subspace projection is proposed to replace the nonsparse projection matrix, which guarantees distributed implementation and projection accuracy. Different from previous work, here, graph signal estimation is studied with no prior anomaly information. To this end, for FDI attack, random attack, noise interference, we propose anomaly detection and node localization scheme based on smoothness, that can achieve similar performance compared with the case of prior anomaly information known. Numerical experiments verify the effectiveness of the proposed DispGF algorithm. The convergence of the algorithm is theoretically analyzed.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=10123952,IEEE Transactions on Network Science and Engineering,2023
Communication and Cooperation for Spherical Underwater Robots by Using Acoustic Transmission,"The application of miniature underwater robots in the marine area is becoming more extensive. Occasionally, the ability of the single miniature underwater robot is limited by its size, configuration, function or propulsion method. At this moment, if a group of robots can work together in a division of labor, that can solve more problems underwater. For autonomous underwater vehicles, the support of underwater wireless communication equipment is required to achieve communication and collaboration. Acoustic communication equipment has generally been used in large underwater vehicles due to its large size and power.

OQFL: An Optimized Quantum-Based Federated Learning Framework for Defending Against Adversarial Attacks in Intelligent Transportation Systems,"Intelligent transportation systems, especially Autonomous Vehicles (AVs), are emerging as a paradigm with the potential to change modern society. However, with this, there is a strong need to ensure the security and privacy of such systems. AV ecosystems depend on machine learning algorithms to autonomously control their operations. Given the amount of personal information AVs collect, coupled with the distributed nature of such ecosystems, there is a movement to employ federated learning algorithms to develop secure decision-making models. Although federated learning is a viable candidate for data privacy, it is vulnerable to adversarial attacks, particularly data poisoning attacks, where malicious vectors would be injected in the training phase. Additionally, hyperparameters play an important role in establishing an efficient federated learning model that can be resilient against adversarial attacks. In this paper, to address these challenges, we propose a novel Optimized Quantum-based Federated Learning (OQFL) framework to automatically adjust the hyperparameters of federated learning using various adversarial attacks in AV settings. This work is innovative in two ways: first, a quantum-behaved particle swarm optimization technique is used to update the hyperparameters of the learning rate, local and global epochs. Second, the proposed technique is utilized within a cyber defense framework to defend against adversarial attacks. The performance of the proposed framework was evaluated using two benchmark datasets: MINST and Fashion-MINST, where they include images that would be extracted from smart cameras of AVs. This framework is shown to be more resilient against various adversarial attacks compared with peer techniques.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9641742,IEEE Transactions on Intelligent Transportation Systems,2023
An Optimal Layout Pattern-Based Solution Approach to the Extended Machine Layout Problem With Multirow Multicolumn Structure,"The machine layout problem (MLP) is to determine the optimal location arrangement of machines in a production system, usually in order to minimize the total material transmission distance. This article considers a type of MLP in an automated manufacturing system with unequal-area machines, machine replicas, and taking multi-row multi-column layout structure. The aim is to determine the near-optimal machine layout and orbit layout simultaneously. We model the problem as a mixed-integer linear program by introducing the concept of orbit-based relative locations and using auxiliary binary variables, including relative location assignment variables, in-block relationship variables, and material routing variables. We further exploit the optimal layout patterns, based on which, when the relative locations of the machines and orbits are given, we can quickly derive the near-optimal absolute machine and orbit positions without solving a mixed-integer linear program. A two-layer hybrid heuristic method is proposed to solve the problem: the outer layer is a variable neighborhood search metaheuristic used to explore the solution space of the relative locations, while the inner layer is a recursive heuristic based on the optimal layout patterns. Experiments on instances of different sizes are conducted, and the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed algorithms are verified. Note to Practitioners—Many manufacturing systems, for example, those in the semiconductor industry, use automated guided vehicles running on orbits to transfer materials between machines. The design of such a manufacturing system consists of determining the numbers of vertical and horizontal orbits, their positions, and the positions of all machines. It is not unusual for there to be hundreds of machines. Furthermore, machines of the same type can be deployed non-adjacently in an automated transfer context since materials can easily be transmitted to an arbitrary machine. The flexibility and complexity of the layout make this layout problem extremely difficult to solve. To the best of our knowledge, no dedicated study has been conducted on this issue. Additionally, state-of-the-art methodologies for related machine layout problems cannot be extended to this problem, partly because one needs to consider the material routing problem explicitly on the orbit network. In this study, we reveal the optimal layout patterns given the relative locations of machines and orbits, and we develop a recursive heuristic that is thousands of times faster than solving the corresponding mixed-integer linear program. Our proposed two-layer hybrid heuristics can solve problems with hundreds of machines, while the inner-layer problem’s precision is guaranteed to within 1%. We believe our algorithm can be used for machine and orbit layout design in flexible manufacturing systems where machine-to-machine material shipment is enables in a rectangular trasmission network.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9796604,IEEE Transactions on Automation Science and Engineering,2023
A Behavior Decision Method Based on Reinforcement Learning for Autonomous Driving,"Autonomous driving vehicles can reduce congestion and improve safety while increasing traffic efficiency. To reflect the quality of driving more comprehensively, the driving safety, efficiency, and occupant comfort should be jointly optimized for autonomous vehicles. Furthermore, in order to cope with complicated traffic environments and achieve satisfactory driving performance, a powerful behavior decision-making module is indispensable for autonomous vehicles. Toward this end, we study a reinforcement-learning (RL)-based method to intelligently make the behavior decision in this article. A Markov decision process (MDP) model is first formulated with a comprehensive reward function, including the effects of driving safety, efficiency, and comfort. The knowledge of the surrounding vehicles is also leveraged to exploit the behavior prediction of the target vehicle. We then propose a behavior decision strategy based on the actor–critic (AC) mechanism, which can efficiently learn both a Gaussian policy function and a linear value function. Finally, the real traffic data are used to build up the simulations for evaluating the performances of the proposed method thoroughly. Simulation results show that our proposed method can significantly reduce the collision rate for autonomous vehicles.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9851435,IEEE Internet of Things Journal,2022
"Multi-UAV Trajectory Control, Resource Allocation, and NOMA User Pairing for Uplink Energy Minimization","In this work, we study the joint optimization of multiple unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs)’ trajectories, power allocation, user-UAV association, and user pairing for UAV-assisted wireless networks employing the nonorthogonal multiple access (NOMA) for uplink communications. The design aims to minimize the total energy consumption of ground users while guaranteeing to successfully transmit their required amount of data to the UAV-mounted base stations. The underlying problem is a mixed-integer nonlinear program (MINLP), which is difficult to solve optimally. To tackle this problem, we derive the optimal power allocation as a function of other variables, which is used to transform the optimization problem into an equivalent form. We then propose an iterative algorithm to solve the resulting optimization problem by using the block coordinate descent (BCD) method where three subproblems are solved in each iteration and this process is repeated until convergence. Specifically, given the UAVs’ trajectories and data rates, we solve the NOMA user pairing, and user-UAV association subproblem optimally by exploiting its special structure. Then, we describe how to optimize the users’ data rates and tackle the UAV trajectory optimization in the second and third subproblems, respectively, by using the successive convex approximation (SCA) method. Numerical results show that our proposed algorithm can provide efficient active-inactive schedules (by setting user’s transmit powers to zero), and lower energy consumption compared to an existing baseline, and an OMA-based resource allocation and UAV-trajectory optimization strategy.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9816078,IEEE Internet of Things Journal,2022
Adversarial Attacks and Defenses Toward AI-Assisted UAV Infrastructure Inspection,"Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) have been widely adopted to assist infrastructure inspection tasks, since they have shown their potential to benefit the inspection in terms of efficiency, cost, and safety. To improve the effectiveness of the inspection, there has been a growing focus of recent research in integrating AI techniques into UAV infrastructure inspection and has achieved promising results. However, no prior work has studied whether such integration will also introduce new security concerns, especially considering the existence of potential vulnerabilities in underlying AI models toward adversarial inputs. In this article, we perform the first study to fill this critical gap by identifying and validating the security vulnerabilities of AI models in the context of UAV infrastructure inspection with a focus on bridge infrastructure. To understand the security property of AI-assisted UAV bridge inspection, we design a two-stage approach for the construction of effective adversarial inputs, with which we successfully validate the existence of security vulnerability using dynamic analysis. Spatial constraints, physical limits, and dynamic environmental changes are taken into consideration in our analysis to make it practical in the physical world. Our evaluation results on a real-world data set show that our constructed adversarial inputs can mislead the UAV to miss detecting a significant amount of risk-prone regions by exploiting the identified vulnerability. Based on such an observation, this article also discusses the defenses based on adversarial training to improve the robustness of AI-assisted UAV bridge inspection, which has been demonstrated to be effective according to our experimental evaluation results.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9888765,IEEE Internet of Things Journal,2022
"Federated-Reinforcement-Learning-Enabled Joint Communication, Sensing, and Computing Resources Allocation in Connected Automated Vehicles Networks","For future connected automated vehicles (CAVs) networks, the joint optimization of communication, sensing, and computing resources is crucial to guarantee the performance of cooperative automated driving’s safety, which is attracting more and more attention. However, the existing works have not considered the low-latency requirement for the raw perception data sharing with both wireless communication link capability and computing efficiency constraints, causing a serious threat to the cooperative automated driving’s safety in CAVs networks. In this article, a vehicle–road–base station cooperation architecture is designed, and a federated reinforcement learning (FRL)-based task offloading and resource allocation algorithm in the CAVs network is proposed to reduce the task execution delay with different communication and computing constraints. The problem of execution delay minimization is theoretically formulated and analyzed under three task practical offloading modes. To adapt to the dynamic topology of the CAVs network, we design a deep reinforcement learning algorithm to achieve the optimal task offloading and resource allocation. To further reduce the data transmission overhead of the centralized reinforcement learning algorithm, the FRL-enabled algorithm is proposed to minimize the execution delay of the optimal task offloading and resource allocation among multiple CAVs. Both the simulation and hardware testbed results verify that the proposed algorithms can not only reduce the execution delay and the communication overhead but also improve the system throughput.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9815075,IEEE Internet of Things Journal,2022
Adversarial Attacks and Defenses for Deep-Learning-Based Unmanned Aerial Vehicles,"The introduction of deep learning (DL) technology can improve the performance of cyber–physical systems (CPSs) in many ways. However, this also brings new security issues. To tackle these challenges, this article explores the vulnerabilities of DL-based unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), which are typical CPSs. Although many research works have been reported previously on adversarial attacks of DL models, only few of them are concerned about safety-critical CPSs, especially regression models in such systems. In this article, we analyze the problem of adversarial attacks against DL-based UAVs and propose two adversarial attack methods against regression models in UAVs. The experiments demonstrate that the proposed nontargeted and targeted attack methods both can craft imperceptible adversarial images and pose a considerable threat to the navigation and control of UAVs. To address this problem, adversarial training and defensive distillation methods are further investigated and evaluated, increasing the robustness of DL models in UAVs. To our knowledge, this is the first study on adversarial attacks and defenses against DL-based UAVs, which calls for more attention to the security and safety of such safety-critical applications.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9530723,IEEE Internet of Things Journal,2022
A Secure Sensor Fusion Framework for Connected and Automated Vehicles Under Sensor Attacks,"As typical applications of cyber–physical systems (CPSs), connected and automated vehicles (CAVs) are able to measure the surroundings and share local information with the other vehicles by using multimodal sensors and wireless networks. CAVs are expected to increase safety, efficiency, and capacity of our transportation systems. However, the increasing usage of sensors has also increased the vulnerability of CAVs to sensor faults and adversarial attacks. Anomalous sensor values resulting from malicious cyberattacks or faulty sensors may cause severe consequences or even fatalities. In this article, we increase the resilience of CAVs to faults and attacks by using multiple sensors for measuring the same physical variable to create redundancy. We exploit this redundancy and propose a sensor fusion algorithm for providing a robust estimate of the correct sensor information with bounded errors independent of the attack signals, and for attack detection and isolation. The proposed sensor fusion framework is applicable to a large class of security-critical CPSs. To minimize the performance degradation resulting from the usage of the estimation for control, we provide an  $H_{\infty }$  controller for cooperative adaptive cruise control-equipped CAVs. The designed controller is capable of stabilizing the closed-loop dynamics of each vehicle in the platoon while reducing the joint effect of estimation errors and communication channel noise on the tracking performance and string behavior of the vehicle platoon. Numerical examples are presented to illustrate the effectiveness of our methods.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9502914,IEEE Internet of Things Journal,2022
Joint Optimization of Deployment and Trajectory in UAV and IRS-Assisted IoT Data Collection System,"Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) can be applied in many Internet of Things (IoT) systems, e.g., smart farms, as a data collection platform. However, the UAV-IoT wireless channels may be occasionally blocked by trees or high-rise buildings. An intelligent reflecting surface (IRS) can be applied to improve the wireless channel quality by smartly reflecting the signal via a large number of low-cost passive reflective elements. This article aims to minimize the energy consumption of the system by jointly optimizing the deployment and trajectory of the UAV. The problem is formulated as a mixed-integer-and-nonlinear programming (MINLP), which is challenging to address by the traditional solution, because the solution may easily fall into the local optimal. To address this issue, we propose a joint optimization framework of deployment and trajectory (JOLT), where an adaptive whale optimization algorithm (AWOA) is applied to optimize the deployment of the UAV, and an elastic ring self-organizing map (ERSOM) is introduced to optimize the trajectory of the UAV. Specifically, in AWOA, a variable-length population strategy is applied to find the optimal number of stop points, and a nonlinear parameter  $a$  and a partial mutation rule are introduced to balance the exploration and exploitation. In ERSOM, a competitive neural network is also introduced to learn the trajectory of the UAV by competitive learning, and a ring structure is presented to avoid the trajectory intersection. Extensive experiments are carried out to show the effectiveness of the proposed JOLT framework.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9802633,IEEE Internet of Things Journal,2022
Computation Capacity Enhancement by Joint UAV and RIS Design in IoT,"Mobile-edge computing (MEC) networks are facing limited coverage and harsh wireless transmission environments that severely hinder the computation capacity of the Internet-of-Things (IoT) devices. To overcome these issues, this article proposes a novel MEC framework empowered by an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) relay and a reconfigurable intelligence surface (RIS). To fully exploit the potentials in terms of computation enhancement brought by the joint UAV and RIS design, we formulate a max–min computation capacity problem via determining the uplink signal detection, active beamforming of UAV, passive beamforming of RIS, time slot partition, computation bits of UAV, and UAV’s trajectory. We develop a concave–convex procedure (CCCP)-based algorithm in an alternating optimization manner over three subproblems to solve the formulated problem. It finds that the CCCP-based algorithm is conducive to decouple the intractable expressions by converting them into new but tractable second-order cone (SOC) constrains. To evaluate the performance of the proposed CCCP-based algorithm, we later design a direct algorithm by exploiting the implicit convexity of the problem. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed CCCP-based algorithm derives a comparable performance as the direct algorithm, and achieves about 2.57-Mb max-min computation capacity higher compared with the straight flight case, and 8.08-Mb max–min computation capacity higher compared with the case without RIS, which validate the superiority of the joint UAV and RIS design for computation enhancement.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9785633,IEEE Internet of Things Journal,2022
Context-Aware Multiagent Broad Reinforcement Learning for Mixed Pedestrian-Vehicle Adaptive Traffic Light Control,"Efficient traffic light control is a critical part of realizing smart transportation. In particular, deep reinforcement learning (DRL) algorithms that use deep neural networks (DNNs) have superior autonomous decision-making ability. Most existing work has applied DRL to control traffic lights intelligently. In this article, we propose a novel context-aware multiagent broad reinforcement learning (CAMABRL) approach based on broad reinforcement learning (BRL) for mixed pedestrian-vehicle adaptive traffic light control (ATLC). CAMABRL exploits the broad learning system (BLS) established in a flat network structure to make decisions instead of a deep network structure. Unlike previous works that consider the attributes of vehicles, CAMABRL also takes the states of pedestrians waiting at the intersection into consideration. Combining with the context-aware mechanism that utilizes the states of adjacent agents and potential state information captured by the long short-term memory (LSTM) network, agents can make farsighted decisions to alleviate traffic congestion. The experimental results show that CAMABRL is superior to several state-of-the-art multiagent reinforcement learning (MARL) methods.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9756574,IEEE Internet of Things Journal,2022
A Pairing-Free Heterogeneous Signcryption Scheme for Unmanned Aerial Vehicles,"During the past few years, as Internet of Things develops rapidly, the applications of unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) technology have been increasingly widely used. Meanwhile, the efficiency and security issues of UAV communication have brought about widespread attention of many researchers in different fields. In an open wireless network, the attacks on UAV communication mainly include eavesdropping, tampering, interrupting, forgery, etc. Signcryption is an appropriate method to address these security problems. However, the existing signcryption schemes are not suitable for UAVs with limited resources and ground station (GS) that needs to process a large number of messages from UAVs. Moreover, in a certain area, UAVs and a GS may belong to different cryptosystems. Therefore, in this article, we came up with a heterogeneous signcryption scheme for UAVs to communicate to a GS (HSC-U2G) without bilinear pairing operation, where UAVs belong to identity-based cryptography (IBC) while the GS belongs to public-key infrastructure (PKI). Moreover, our scheme provides identity privacy for UAVs and supports batch verification for the GS. Using the random oracle model, we demonstrate HSC-U2G can achieve insider security for confidentiality as well as unforgeability. After that, HSC-U2G is compared with several important related works and we provide all experimental results to show the efficiency.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9762807,IEEE Internet of Things Journal,2022
Multi-Agent Coordinated Close-in Jamming for Disabling a Rogue Drone,"Drones, including remotely piloted aircraft or unmanned aerial vehicles, have become extremely appealing over the recent years, with a multitude of applications and usages. However, they can potentially present major threats for security and public safety, especially when they fly across critical infrastructures and public spaces. This work investigates a novel counter-drone solution by proposing a multi-agent framework in which a team of pursuer drones cooperate in order to track and jam a rogue drone. Within the proposed framework, a joint mobility and power control solution is developed to optimize the respective decisions of each cooperating agent in order to best track and intercept the moving rogue drone. Both centralized and distributed variants of the joint optimization problem are developed and extensive simulations are conducted to evaluate the performance of the problem variants and to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed solution.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9363641,IEEE Transactions on Mobile Computing,2022
Machine-Learning-Based 3-D Channel Modeling for U2V mmWave Communications,"Unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) millimeter wave (mmWave) technologies can provide flexible link and high data rate for future communication networks. By considering the new features of three-dimensional (3-D) scattering space, 3-D velocity, 3-D antenna array, and especially 3-D rotations, a machine learning (ML)-integrated UAV-to-Vehicle (U2V) mmWave channel model is proposed. Meanwhile, an ML-based network for channel parameter calculation and generation is developed. The deterministic parameters are calculated based on the simplified geometry information, while the random ones are generated by the backpropagation-based neural network (BPNN) and generative adversarial network (GAN), where the training data set is obtained from massive ray-tracing (RT) simulations. Moreover, theoretical expressions of channel statistical properties, i.e., power delay profile (PDP), autocorrelation function (ACF), Doppler power spectrum density (DPSD), and cross-correlation function (CCF), are derived and analyzed. Finally, the U2V mmWave channel is generated under a typical urban scenario at 28 GHz. The generated PDP and DPSD show good agreement with RT-based results, which validates the effectiveness of proposed method. Moreover, the impact of 3-D rotations, which has rarely been reported in previous works, can be observed in the generated CCF and ACF, which are also consistent with the theoretical and measurement results.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9724219,IEEE Internet of Things Journal,2022
BDTwin: An Integrated Framework for Enhancing Security and Privacy in Cybertwin-Driven Automotive Industrial Internet of Things,"The rapid development of the automotive Industrial Internet of Things requires secure networking infrastructure toward digitalization. Cybertwin (CT) is a next-generation networking architecture that serves as a communication, and digital asset owner, and can make the Vehicle-to-Everything (V2X) network flexible and secure. However, CT itself can publish end users’ digital assets to other entities as a service, making data security and privacy major obstacles in the realization of V2X applications. Motivated from the aforementioned discussion, this article presents BDTwin, a blockchain and deep-learning-based integrated framework to enhance security and privacy in CT-driven V2X applications. Specifically, a blockchain scheme is designed to ensure secure communication among vehicles, roadside units, CT-edge server, and cloud server using a smart contract-based enhance-Proof-of-Work (ePoW) and Zero Knowledge Proof (ZKP)-based verification process. Smart contracts are used to enforce rules and regulations that govern the behavior of V2X entities in a nondeniable and automated manner. In a deep-learning scheme, an autoregressive-deep variational autoencoder model is combined with attention-based bidirectional long short-term memory (A-BLSTM) for automatic feature extraction and attack detection by analyzing CT-edge servers data in a V2X environment. Security analysis and experimental results using two different sources, ToN-IoT and CICIDS-2017 show the superiority of the proposed BDTwin framework over some baseline and recent state-of-the-art techniques.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9583667,IEEE Internet of Things Journal,2022
Comprehensive Ocean Information-Enabled AUV Path Planning Via Reinforcement Learning,"The path planning of the autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV) has shown great potential in various Internet of Underwater Things (IoUT) applications. Although considerable efforts had been made, prior studies are confronted with some limitations. For one thing, existing work only uses the ocean current simulation model without introducing real ocean information, having not been supported by real data. For another, traditional path planning algorithms have strong environment dependence and lack flexibility: once the environment changes, they need to be remodeled and replanned. To overcome these challenges, this article proposes comprehensive ocean information D3QN (COID), an AUV path planning scheme exploiting comprehensive ocean information and reinforcement learning (RL), which consists of three steps. First, we introduce the comprehensive real ocean data, including weather, temperature, thermohaline, current, etc., and apply them into the regional ocean modeling system to generated reliable ocean current. Next, through well-designed state transition function and reward function, we build a 3-D grid model of ocean environment for RL. Furthermore, based on the framework of the double dueling deep  $Q$  network (D3QN), COID integrates local ocean current and position features to provide state input and uses priority sampling to accelerate network convergence. The performance of COID has been evaluated and proved by numerical results, which demonstrate efficient path planning and high flexibility for expansion into different ocean environments.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9723442,IEEE Internet of Things Journal,2022
Blockchain-Assisted Distributed and Lightweight Authentication Service for Industrial Unmanned Aerial Vehicles,"Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) have shown great potential in benefiting industries due to their good features, such as the ease of deployment and low maintenance cost. However, the communication security issue remains a serious challenge before the large-scale application of industrial UAVs. The untrusted communication environment can cause the leakage of valuable industrial data or the losing of important cargos that carried by UAVs. Traditional authentication mechanisms for protecting communications include public-key infrastructure-based, ID-based, and certificateless authentication. These mechanisms rely on a central authority and some of them may introduce high-complexity computation that is not suitable for industrial drones. Therefore, aiming at these challenges, we design a blockchain-assisted distributed and lightweight authentication service for industrial UAVs. The blockchain technology supports the distributed and immutable storage of industrial UAVs’ authentication information, and smart contracts enable convenient operations for drones to acquire or update the corresponding information. Security evaluation demonstrates that our scheme is resistant to various attacks and can guarantee trustworthy communications for industrial drones. Extensive experiments also show that our designed authentication service can not only achieve low computation and communication cost for industrial UAVs but also remain robust even if a small proportion of drones are compromised.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9678341,IEEE Internet of Things Journal,2022
Federated Learning With Fair Incentives and Robust Aggregation for UAV-Aided Crowdsensing,"Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) combined with artificial intelligence (AI) have recently gathered significant interest to enable intelligent and on-demand crowdsensing applications. In conventional AI approaches, a wealth of UAVs’ sensory data (which may be privacy-sensitive) needs to be mitigated to the central storage for model training, which poses severe privacy and data misuse risks. The promising federated learning (FL) allows UAVs to cooperatively train a shared model while keeping the private raw data locally. However, FL imposes heavy communication loads on battery-limited UAVs owing to frequent local training and global synchronization. Due to the heterogeneity of UAVs and presence of free-riders and Byzantine UAVs, the quality of UAVs’ model updates can vary dramatically, raising great challenges for fair incentives and robust model aggregation. In this paper, we propose a novel fair and robust federated learning (FRFL) scheme in UAV-aided crowdsensing. Specifically, we first exploit edge computing-enabled 5G heterogeneous networks in the FL framework to offer proximal FL services with high data rate and low latency for UAVs. Then, based on contract theory, we design an optimal incentive mechanism to precisely and fairly encourage UAVs’ participation in FL under information asymmetry. The method is proved to be truthful, contractual feasible, and computationally efficient. Furthermore, we develop Byzantine-robust aggregation rules and fair model profit allocation rules via contribution index measurement. We also propose a reputation mechanism for credible UAVs recruitment and free-rider prevention by leveraging historical learning records and exploring record freshness for weight assignment. Simulation results validate the efficiency of FRFL in terms of user utility, communication efficiency, and robustness.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9664267,IEEE Transactions on Network Science and Engineering,2022
Delay and Reliability-Constrained VNF Placement on Mobile and Volatile 5G Infrastructure,"Ongoing research and industrial exploitation of SDN and NFV technologies promise higher flexibility on network automation and infrastructure optimization. Choosing the location of Virtual Network Functions is a central problem in the automation and optimization of the software-defined, virtualization-based next generation of networks such as 5G and beyond. Network services provided for autonomous vehicles, factory automation, e-health and cloud robotics often require strict delay bounds and reliability constraints influenced by the location of its composing Virtual Network Functions. Robots, vehicles and other end-devices provide significant capabilities such as actuators, sensors and local computation which are essential for some services. Moreover, these devices are continuously on the move and might lose network connection or run out of battery, which further challenge service delivery in this dynamic environment. This work tackles the mobility, and battery restrictions; as well as the temporal aspects and conflicting traits of reliable, low latency service deployment over a volatile network, where mobile compute nodes act as an extension of the cloud and edge computing infrastructure. The problem is formulated as a cost-minimizing Virtual Network Function placement optimization and an efficient heuristic is proposed. The algorithms are extensively evaluated from various aspects by simulation on detailed real-world scenarios.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9339982,IEEE Transactions on Mobile Computing,2022
SARDO: An Automated Search-and-Rescue Drone-Based Solution for Victims Localization,"Natural disasters affect millions of people every year. Finding missing persons in the shortest possible time is of crucial importance to reduce the death toll. This task is especially challenging when victims are sparsely distributed in large and/or difficult-to-reach areas and cellular networks are down. In this paper we present SARDO, a drone-based search and rescue solution that leverages the high penetration rate of mobile phones in the society to localize missing people. SARDO is an autonomous, all-in-one drone-based mobile network solution that does not require infrastructure support or mobile phones modifications. It builds on novel concepts such as pseudo-trilateration combined with machine-learning techniques to efficiently locate mobile phones in a given area. Our results, with a prototype implementation in a field-[1], show that SARDO rapidly determines the location of mobile phones ($\sim \!3$∼3 min/UE) in a given area with an accuracy of few tens of meters and at a low battery consumption cost ($\sim \!5\%$∼5%). State-of-the-art localization solutions for disaster scenarios rely either on mobile infrastructure support or exploit onboard cameras for human/computer vision, IR, thermal-based localization. To the best of our knowledge, SARDO is the first drone-based cellular search-and-rescue solution able to accurately localize missing victims through mobile phones.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9321707,IEEE Transactions on Mobile Computing,2022
Fortifying Smart Transportation Security Through Public Blockchain,"Smart vehicles-enabled intelligent transportation system (ITS) supports a wide range of applications, such as, but not limited to, traffic planning and management, collision avoidance alert system, automated road speed enforcement, electronic toll collection, and real-time parking management, to name a few. However, it suffers from various types of security and privacy issues due to insecure communication among the entities over public channels. Therefore, an efficient and lightweight security mechanism is essential to protect the data that is both at rest as well as in transit. To this direction, we propose a public blockchain-envisioned secure communication framework for ITS (PBSCF-ITS). The proposed PBSCF-ITS guarantees access control and key management among the vehicle to vehicle, vehicle to roadside unit, and roadside unit to cloud server. We analyze the security of PBSCF-ITS to prove its resilience against various types of possible attacks. Furthermore, the performance of PBSCF-ITS with other related competing schemes has been compared. The obtained results illustrate that PBSCF-ITS outperforms the existing ones. Additionally, the pragmatic study of PBSCF-ITS is conducted to check its influence on various network-related performance parameters, like the number of mined blocks and transactions per block.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9709886,IEEE Internet of Things Journal,2022
Beamforming Design and Performance Analysis for Satellite and UAV Integrated Networks in IoRT Applications,"Satellite and unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) integrated networks (SUINs) are considered as a promising method to offer various Internet of Remote Things (IoRT) applications. In this article, we investigate the downlink transmission of SUINs where the satellite-to-UAV link uses the free-space optical (FSO) technology with an equal gain combining (EGC) scheme while the links from UAV to IoRT devices exploit radio frequency (RF) with the space-division multiple access (SDMA) technique. Specifically, considering that only statistical channel state information (CSI) is available, we first formulate an optimization problem to maximize the ergodic sum rate (ESR) of the system, which is constrained by the total transmit power budget and IoRT devices’ rate requirements. Then, a beamforming (BF) scheme based on the alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM) is proposed to solve the nonconvex problem. Furthermore, a zero-forcing (ZF)-based suboptimal approach is also presented to reduce the implementation complexity. Finally, by assuming that the FSO link and RF links are subject to Gamma–Gamma fading and Nakagami- $m$  fading, respectively, we derive closed-form ESR expressions for the considered network with the proposed BF schemes. Simulation results are provided to confirm the accuracy of the theoretical analysis. Moreover, it is revealed that our proposed EGC scheme for FSO communication and BF schemes for RF transmission can both achieve better performance than the existing works.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9766223,IEEE Internet of Things Journal,2022
Risk Adversarial Learning System for Connected and Autonomous Vehicle Charging,"In this article, the design of a rational decision support system (RDSS) for a connected and autonomous vehicle charging infrastructure (CAV-CI) is studied. In the considered CAV-CI, the distribution system operator (DSO) deploys electric vehicle supply equipment (EVSE) to provide an electrical vehicle (EV) charging facility for human-driven connected vehicles (CVs) and AVs. The charging request by the human-driven EV becomes irrational when it demands more energy and charging period than its actual need. Therefore, the scheduling policy of each EVSE must be adaptively accumulated the irrational charging request to satisfy the charging demand of both CVs and autonomous vehicles (AVs). To tackle this, we formulate an RDSS problem for the DSO, where the objective is to maximize the charging capacity utilization by satisfying the laxity risk of the DSO. Thus, we devise a rational reward maximization problem to adapt the irrational behavior by CVs in a data-informed manner. We propose a novel risk adversarial multiagent learning system (RAMALS) for CAV-CI to solve the formulated RDSS problem. In RAMALS, the DSO acts as a centralized risk adversarial agent (RAA) for informing the laxity risk to each EVSE. Subsequently, each EVSE plays the role of a self-learner agent to adaptively schedule its own EV sessions by coping advice from RAA. The experiment results show that the proposed RAMALS affords around 46.6% improvement in charging rate, about 28.6% improvement in the EVSE’s active charging time, and at least 33.3% more energy utilization, as compared to a currently deployed ACN EVSE system, and other baselines.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9703673,IEEE Internet of Things Journal,2022
Dynamic-Detection-Based Trajectory Planning for Autonomous Underwater Vehicle to Collect Data From Underwater Sensors,"Marine science and Internet of Underwater Things applications rely significantly on collecting data from underwater sensors. Data collection using long-distance underwater acoustic communications consumes a lot of energy in underwater sensor nodes, which are powered by batteries. To achieve low-energy consumption, we can use the autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV) to move close to sensor nodes and exploit the short-range and high-rate communications. Most of the existing AUV-based data collection schemes consider the scenarios having the knowledge of node positions, where the cruising trajectory can be computed before the AUV’s departure. These schemes cannot apply to some scenarios such as turtle tracking for a certain sea area having no position information. To this end, we first propose a planning-while-detecting approach to dynamically detect the sensors on turtles and adjust the AUV cruising direction to collect data. To further improve data efficiency under the energy limit of the AUV, we group the sensors that can share the same trajectory using their detected directions. A grouping-based dynamic trajectory planning (GDTP) is then proposed to determine the next cruising direction that can visit the group of sensors having the largest amount of data and demanding the least cruising energy at the risk of detection errors. Simulation results show that GDTP achieves significantly higher data collection efficiency than the existing trajectory planning algorithms in dynamic scenarios, and as the communication range increases, it can even outperform the existing algorithms with node locations.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9675831,IEEE Internet of Things Journal,2022
Mitigating Traffic Remapping Attacks in Autonomous Multihop Wireless Networks,"Multihop wireless networks with autonomous nodes are susceptible to selfish traffic remapping attacks (TRAs). Nodes launching TRAs leverage the underlying channel access function to receive an unduly high Quality of Service (QoS) for packet flows traversing source-to-destination routes. TRAs are easy to execute, impossible to prevent, difficult to detect, and harmful to the QoS of honest nodes. Recognizing the need for providing QoS security, we use a novel network-oriented QoS metric to propose a self-enforcing game-theoretic mitigation approach. By switching between TRA and honest behavior, selfish nodes engage in a noncooperative multistage game in pursuit of high QoS. We analyze feasible node strategies and design a distributed signaling mechanism called DISTRESS, under which, given certain conditions, the game produces a desirable outcome: after an upper bounded play time, honesty tends to become a selfish node’s best reply behavior, while yielding acceptable QoS to most or all nodes. We verify these findings by Monte Carlo and ns-3 simulations of static and mobile nodes.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9684538,IEEE Internet of Things Journal,2022
Bift: A Blockchain-Based Federated Learning System for Connected and Autonomous Vehicles,"Machine learning (ML) algorithms are essential components in autonomous driving. In most existing connected and autonomous vehicles (CAVs), a large amount of driving data collected from multiple vehicles are sent to a central server for unified training. However, data privacy and security have become crucial during the data-sharing process. Federated learning (FL) for data security has arisen nowadays, and it can improve the data privacy of distribute machine learning. However, the malicious attackers can still be able to attack the training process. Due to the complete reliance on the central server, FL is very fragile. To address the above problem, we propose Bift: 1) a fully decentralized ML system combined with FL and 2) blockchain to provide a privacy-preserving ML process for CAVs. Bift enables distributed CAVs to train ML models locally using their own driving data and then to upload the local models to get a better global model. More importantly, Bift provides a consensus algorithm named Proof of Federated Learning to resist possible adversaries. We evaluate the performance of Bift and demonstrate that Bift is scalable and robust, and can defend against malicious attacks.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9650783,IEEE Internet of Things Journal,2022
"Wireless Information and Power Transfer for IoT: Pulse Position Modulation, Integrated Receiver, and Experimental Validation","Simultaneous wireless information and power transfer (SWIPT) has emerged as a viable technique to energize and connect low-power autonomous devices and enable future Internet of Things (IoT). A major challenge of SWIPT is the energy consumption of the receiver of such low-power devices. An attractive low-power solution consists of an integrated information decoder (ID) and energy harvester (EH) architecture for SWIPT receiver (IntRx) where the received radiofrequency (RF) signal is first rectified before being used for information decoding. Such architecture eliminates the need for energy-consuming RF components, such as local oscillators and mixers. This article proposes a novel modulation and demodulation method for the IntRx SWIPT architecture based on pulse position modulation (PPM) where information is encoded in the position of the pulse. The new method transmits high amplitude pulses to increase the peak-to-average power ratio (PAPR) of the transmit signal and exploits the EH’s nonlinearity so as to boost the harvested dc power. Simultaneously, the information can be decoded from the rectifier signal by simply finding the position of the pulse in a certain symbol duration. We have analyzed both the information and the power transfer performance of the newly proposed PPM for IntRx SWIPT theoretically, numerically, and experimentally. To that end, we have established a SWIPT system testbed in an indoor environment by prototyping a base station to transfer information-power signal and the IntRx SWIPT receiver, including ID and EH blocks. The performance evaluation of the PPM was carried out in various conditions, and the results have been compared and contrasted to conventional signals. Theoretical, numerical, and experimental results highlight the significant benefits of the proposed PPM scheme to enhance the power transfer performance and operate information decoding with low-power consumption.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9651541,IEEE Internet of Things Journal,2022
Detection and Blind Channel Estimation for UAV-Aided Wireless Sensor Networks in Smart Cities Under Mobile Jamming Attack,"Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) can be integrated into wireless sensor networks (WSNs) for smart city applications in several ways. Among them, a UAV can be employed as a relay in a “store-carry and forward” fashion by uploading data from ground sensors and metering devices and, then, downloading it to a central unit. However, both the uploading and downloading phases can be prone to potential threats and attacks. As a legacy from traditional wireless networks, the jamming attack is still one of the major and serious threats to UAV-aided communications, especially when also the jammer is mobile, e.g., it is mounted on a UAV or inside a terrestrial vehicle. In this article, we investigate anti-jamming communications for UAV-aided WSNs operating over doubly selective channels in the downloading phase. In such a scenario, the signals transmitted by the UAV and the malicious mobile jammer undergo both time dispersion due to multipath propagation effects and frequency dispersion caused by their mobility. To suppress high-power jamming signals, we propose a blind physical-layer technique that jointly detects the UAV and jammer symbols through serial disturbance cancelation based on symbol-level post-sorting of the detector output. Amplitudes, phases, time delays, and Doppler shifts—required to implement the proposed detection strategy—are blindly estimated from data through the use of algorithms that exploit the almost-cyclostationarity properties of the received signal and the detailed structure of multicarrier modulation format. Simulation results corroborate the anti-jamming capabilities of the proposed method, for different mobility scenarios of the jammer.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9634169,IEEE Internet of Things Journal,2022
Defense Against Machine Learning Based Attacks in Multi-UAV Networks: A Network Coding Based Approach,"Thanks to the agility and mobility features, unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) have been applied for a wide range of civil and military missions. To remotely control and monitor UAVs, mission-related data such as location and trajectory information are transmitted over wireless channels. However, UAV networks are vulnerable to eavesdropping attacks due to: 1) the broadcasting nature of wireless channels; 2) the broad coverage in aerial environments. In this paper, we investigate the potential security threats in UAV networks with passive attackers who aim to eavesdrop and decode encrypted locations by using machine learning techniques. We show that a neural network of two hidden layers is able to decode the encrypted locations if using the existing location protection methods. To defend against such machine learning based attacks, we suggest a location protection approach based on the random linear network coding with encryption keys being randomly permuted. We prove that our proposed approach allows for a low attacker's success probability and provides untraceability property. Our simulation results indicate that our approach significantly outperforms the existing location protection methods in terms of attacker's bit error rate, even with a small number of UAVs.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9754235,IEEE Transactions on Network Science and Engineering,2022
A Lightweight and Privacy-Preserving Mutual Authentication and Key Agreement Protocol for Internet of Drones Environment,"With accelerated advances in various technologies, drones, better known as unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), are increasingly commonplace and consequently have a more pronounced impact on society. For example, Internet of Drones (IoD), a new communication paradigm offering fundamental navigation assistance and access to information, has widespread applications ranging from agricultural drones in farming to surveillance drones in the COVID-19 pandemic. The increasingly prominent role of IoD in our society also reinforces the importance of securing such systems against various data privacy and security threats. Operationally, it can be challenging to adopt conventional off-the-shelf security products in an IoD system due to the underpinning characteristics of drones (e.g., dynamic and open communication channel). Therefore in this article, we propose a lightweight and privacy-preserving mutual authentication and key agreement protocol, hereafter referred to as PMAP. The latter uses a physical unclonable function (PUF) and chaotic system to support mutual authentication and establish a secure session key between communication entities in the IoD system. To be specific, PMAP consists of two schemes, namely: 1)  ${\mathrm{ PMAP}}^{D2Z}$  (that mutually authenticates drone and zone service provider (ZSP) and establishes secure session keys) and 2)  ${\mathrm{ PMAP}}^{D2D}$  (that mutually authenticates drones and establishes secure session keys). In addition, PMAP supports conditional privacy preserving so that the genuine identity of drones can only be revealed by trusted ZSPs. We evaluate the security of PMAP using automated validation of Internet security protocols and application (AVISPA), as well as provide formal and informal security analysis to show the resilience of PMAP against various security attacks. We also evaluate the performance of PMAP through extensive experiments and compare its performance with existing AKA and IBE-Lite schemes, whose findings show that PMAP achieves better performance in terms of computation cost, energy consumption, and communication overhead.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9745033,IEEE Internet of Things Journal,2022
Energy-Efficient and Secure Communication Toward UAV Networks,"Wireless networks ensure the unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) communicate and cooperate with each other, which plays an indispensable role among UAVs. The two crucial challenges in UAV wireless networks are energy saving and security. The current lightweight communication approaches lead to insufficient robustness of the encrypted transmission that is insecure. To address this issue, we propose a secure transmission approach with energy efficiency toward UAVs networks. We design a lightweight symmetric encryption algorithm based on SM4 and the relevant key negotiation and update mechanism to protect the confidentiality of communication contents. Moreover, a modified aggregative BLS signature scheme, together with the Merkle Hash tree (MHT), is introduced to guarantee the integrity and authenticity of data packets in transmission. Furthermore, we propose an online/offline revocable identity-based group signature (OORIBGS) scheme and integrate it into our framework for UAV anonymity, traceability, as well as revocability with small key management cost and high efficiency. We give detailed security analysis and prove that our proposal has the properties of data confidentiality, integrity, and authenticity, as well as identity traceability and anonymity. Moreover, we apply our approach in the UAVs networks and evaluate the runtime and anti-attack performance. The experimental results show that the proposed method can be effectively used in UAVs secure communication.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9560132,IEEE Internet of Things Journal,2022
MD-GAN-Based UAV Trajectory and Power Optimization for Cognitive Covert Communications,"This article investigates the covert performance of an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) jammer-assisted cognitive radio (CR) network. In particular, the covert transmission of secondary users can be effectively protected by UAV jamming against the eavesdropping. For practical consideration, the UAV is assumed to only know certain partial channel distribution information (CDI), whereas not to know the detection threshold of an eavesdropper. For this sake, we propose a model-driven generative adversarial network (MD-GAN)-assisted optimization framework, consisting of a generator and a discriminator, where the unknown channel information and the detection threshold are learned weights. Then, a GAN-based joint trajectory and power optimization (GAN-JTP) algorithm is developed to train the MD-GAN optimization framework for covert communication, which results in the joint solution of the UAV’s trajectory and transmits power to maximize the covert rate and the probability of detection errors. Our simulation results show that the proposed GAN-JTP with a rapid convergence speed can attain near-optimal solutions of the UAV’s trajectory and transmit power for the covert communication.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9584882,IEEE Internet of Things Journal,2022
"FALCON: A Networked Drone System for Sensing, Localizing, and Approaching RF Targets","We present FALCON, a novel autonomous drone network system for sensing, localizing, and approaching RF targets/sources such as smartphone devices. Potential applications of our system include disaster relief missions in which networked drones sense the Wi-Fi signal emitted from a victim’s smartphone and dynamically navigate to accurately localize and quickly approach the victim, for instance, to deliver the time-critical first-aid kits. For that we exploit Wi-Fi’s recent fine time measurement (FTM) protocol to realize the first on-drone FTM sensor network that enables accurate and dynamic ranging of targets in a mission. We propose a flight planning strategy that adapts the trajectory of the drones to concurrently favor localizing and approaching the target. Namely, our approach jointly optimizes the drones’ diversity of observations and the target approaching process, while flexibly trading off the intensities of the potentially conflicting objectives. We implement FALCON via a custom-designed multidrone platform and demonstrate up to  $2\times $  localization accuracy compared to a baseline flocking approach, while spending 30% less time localizing targets.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9716067,IEEE Internet of Things Journal,2022
Autonomous Driving Security: State of the Art and Challenges,"The autonomous driving industry has mushroomed over the past decade. Although autonomous driving has undoubtedly become one of the most promising technologies of this century, its development faces multiple challenges, of which security is the major concern. In this article, we present a thorough analysis of autonomous driving security. First, the attack surface of autonomous driving is presented. After an analysis of the operation of autonomous driving in terms of key components and technologies, the security of autonomous driving is elaborated in four dimensions: 1) sensors; 2) operating system; 3) control system; and 4) vehicle-to-everything (V2X) communication. Sensor security is examined from five components, which are mainly responsible for self-positioning and environmental perception. The analysis of operating system security, the second dimension, is concentrated on the robot operating system. Concerning the control system security, the controller area network is approached mainly from vulnerabilities and protection measures. The fourth dimension, V2X communication security, is probed from four categories of attacks: 1) authenticity/identification; 2) availability; 3) data integrity; and 4) confidentiality with corresponding solutions. Moreover, the drawbacks of existing methods adopted in the four dimensions are also provided. Finally, a conceptual multilayer defense framework is proposed to secure the information flow from external communication to the physical autonomous vehicle.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9625017,IEEE Internet of Things Journal,2022
Temporal Pyramid Network With Spatial-Temporal Attention for Pedestrian Trajectory Prediction,"Understanding and predicting human motion behavior with social interactions have become an increasingly crucial problem for a vast number of applications, ranging from visual navigation of autonomous vehicles to activity prediction of intelligent video surveillance. Accurately forecasting crowd motion behavior is challenging due to the multimodal nature of trajectories and complex social interactions between humans. Recent algorithms model and predict the trajectory with a single resolution, making them difficult to exploit the long-range information and the short-range information of the motion behavior simultaneously. In this paper, we propose a temporal pyramid network for pedestrian trajectory prediction through a squeeze modulation and a dilation modulation. The hierarchical design of our framework allows to model the trajectory with multi-resolution, then can better capture the motion behavior at various tempos. By progressively combining the global context with the local one, we finally construct a coarse-to-fine hierarchical pedestrian trajectory prediction framework with multi-supervision. Further, we introduce a unified spatial-temporal attention mechanism to adaptively select important information of persons around in both spatial and temporal domains. We show that our attention strategy is intuitive and effective to encode the influence of social interactions. Experimental results on two benchmarks demonstrate the superiority of our proposed scheme.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9373939,IEEE Transactions on Network Science and Engineering,2022
RTT-Based Rogue UAV Detection in IoV Networks,"Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) are being used in different emerging domains for accomplishing many critical tasks. However, due to the various constraints, such as battery life, computational resources, etc., a UAV under a mission (M-UAV) often needs assistance from an edge/cloud server that is reachable from the M-UAV’s location. A connection between an M-UAV and edge server can be established via an access point or AP. Therefore, before sharing any sensitive information with the edge server, it is essential for an M-UAV to determine the legitimacy of the selected AP. Recently, some works in this direction indicate that a rogue UAV (R-UAV) can successfully mimic a legitimate AP for intercepting the communication channel. Hence, there should be a robust detection mechanism in place for addressing such a threat scenario. In this article, considering one of the emerging domains—the Internet of Vehicle (IoV) networks, at first, we show that communication in the IoV networks can get benefit from the presence of M-UAVs. However, as the link between the M-UAV and edge server can be intercepted by an R-UAV, the adversary may access the sensitive information from the IoV networks. Followed by this, we propose a timing-based algorithm for identifying the presence of rogue APs (or R-UAVs) in the channel. The M-UAV executes the timing-based algorithm, and the detection method does not require any auxiliary hardware or any modification to the network protocols for meeting the objective. Supported by an extensive evaluation study, we show that without any rigid restriction on the M-UAV’s speed (e.g., by limiting it to almost static) the proposed approach significantly enhances the detection accuracy (at least by a margin of 29.7% and 16.65%) compared to the state-of-the-art methods.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9321353,IEEE Internet of Things Journal,2022
Blockchain-Based Cross-Domain Authentication for Intelligent 5G-Enabled Internet of Drones,"While 5G can facilitate high-speed Internet access and make over-the-horizon control a reality for unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs; also known as drones), there are also potential security and privacy considerations, for example, authentication among drones. Centralized authentication approaches not only suffer from a single point of failure but they are also incapable of cross-domain authentication. This complicates the cooperation of drones from different domains. To address these limitations, a blockchain-based cross-domain authentication scheme for intelligent 5G-enabled Internet of drones is proposed in this article. Our approach employs multiple signatures based on threshold sharing to build an identity federation for collaborative domains. This allows us to support domain joining and exiting. Reliable communication between cross-domain devices is achieved by utilizing smart contract for authentication. The session keys are negotiated to secure subsequent communication between two parties. Our security and performance evaluations show that the proposed scheme is resistant to common attacks targeting Internet of Things (IoT) devices (including drones), as well as demonstrating its effectiveness and efficiency.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9540762,IEEE Internet of Things Journal,2022
Multi-UAV Cooperative Localization for Marine Targets Based on Weighted Subspace Fitting in SAGIN Environment,"As an indispensable part of the Internet of Vehicles (IoV), unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) can be deployed for target positioning and navigation in the space–air–ground-integrated network (SAGIN) environment. Maritime target positioning is very important for the safe navigation of ships, hydrographic surveys, and marine resource exploration. Traditional methods typically exploit satellites to locate marine targets in the SAGIN environment, and the location accuracy does not satisfy the requirements of modern ocean observation missions. In order to localize the marine target, we develop a system architecture in this article, which contains UAVs integrated with monostatic multiple-input–multiple-output (MIMO) radars. The main thrust is to estimate the direction-of-arrival (DOA) via MIMO radar. Herein, we consider a general scenario that unknown mutual coupling exist and a novel sparse reconstruction algorithm is proposed. The mutual coupling matrix (MCM) is adopted with the help of its special structure, we formulate the data model as a sparse representation form. Then, two novel matrices, a weighted matrix, and a reduced-dimensional matrix are constructed to reduce the computational complexity and enhance the sparsity, respectively. Thereafter, a sparse constraint model is constructed using the concept of optimal weighted subspace fitting (WSF). Finally, the DOA estimation of maritime targets can be achieved by reconstructing the support of a block sparse matrix. Based on the DOA estimation results, multiple UAVs are used to cross-locate marine targets multiple times, and an accurate marine target position is achieved in the SAGIN environment. Numerical results are carried out, which demonstrates the effectiveness of the proposed DOA estimator, and the multi-UAV cooperative localization system can realize accurate target localization.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9380358,IEEE Internet of Things Journal,2022
Robust Fuzzy Learning for Partially Overlapping Channels Allocation in UAV Communication Networks,"With significantly dynamic characteristics of the new aerial users, the emerging cellular-enabled unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) communication paradigm raises great challenges to current research of UAV applications. As far as the robust channel allocation is concerned, the high mobility of UAV nodes and the unexpected disturbance of external environment would render most existing methods which rely on definite information and are vulnerable to dynamic environment, become less attractive or even invalid. In this paper, we particularly investigate a cellular-enabled mesh UAV network exploiting partially overlapping channels (POCs), and propose a distributed fuzzy space based learning scheme for POCs allocation to combat the dynamic environment. Rather than the perfect channel state information (CSI) assumption, the dynamic and uncertain CSI of UAVs is characterized by fuzzy number. On this basis, the allocation process can be implemented in a mapped fuzzy space. Integrating fuzzy-logic and game based learning, we formulate the problem of POCs assignment as a fuzzy payoffs game (FPG), and demonstrate the existence of fuzzy Nash equilibrium for our designed FPG. Then, with the derived priority vector in the fuzzy space, the equilibrium solution can be achieved by the proposed algorithm. Numerical simulations demonstrate the advantages of our new scheme.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9195753,IEEE Transactions on Mobile Computing,2022
Distributed Double-Layer Control for Coordination of Multiplatoons Approaching Road Restriction in the Presence of IoV Communication Delays,"Internet of Vehicle (IoV) has become a hot topic in the last years due to its significant benefits in transportation systems in terms of quality, costs, and traffic management capability. Indeed, accurate and real-time information acquisition and diffusion are required to reach an efficient traffic management system according to the smart city paradigm. In this context, this article provides a novel IoV-based distributed double layer control architecture to address the coordination control problem of connected autonomous vehicles (CAVs) multiple platoons negotiating the access to a road section restriction in the presence of heterogeneous communication time-varying delays. To this aim, leveraging the IoV paradigm and the equivalent virtual formation concept, we propose a novel distributed diffusive longitudinal protocol and a distributed lateral potential-function-based control strategy, where both of them are able to cope with communication delays and ensuring the multiplatoon coordination in finite time, i.e., before accessing the road section restrictions, so to avoid vehicles collisions. The finite-time stability of both the cooperative controllers is analytically proved by exploiting the Lyapunov–Krasovskii theory and the derived delay-dependent stability conditions, expressed as a set of linear matrix inequalities (LMIs), allows the proper tuning of the controllers gains. Numerical analysis confirms the theoretical derivation and discloses the effectiveness and the robustness of the proposed cooperative multiplatoon control in ensuring the safe crossing of the road section restriction in finite time.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9507523,IEEE Internet of Things Journal,2022
BCC: Blockchain-Based Collaborative Crowdsensing in Autonomous Vehicular Networks,"The vehicular crowdsensing, which benefits from edge computing devices (ECDs) distributedly selecting autonomous vehicles (AVs) to complete the sensing tasks and collecting the sensing results, represents a practical and promising solution to facilitate the autonomous vehicular networks (AVNs). With frequent data transaction and rewards distribution in the crowdsensing process, how to design an integrated scheme which guarantees the privacy of AVs and enables the ECDs to earn rewards securely while minimizing the task execution cost (TEC) therefore becomes a challenge. To this end, in this article, we develop a blockchain-based collaborative crowdsensing (BCC) scheme to support secure and efficient vehicular crowdsensing in AVNs. In the BCC, by considering the potential attacks in the crowdsensing process, we first develop a secure crowdsensing environment by designing a blockchain-based transaction architecture to deal with privacy and security issues. With the designed architecture, we then propose a coalition game with a transferable reward to motivate AVs to cooperatively execute the crowdsensing tasks by jointly considering the requirements of the tasks and the available sensing resources of AVs. After that, based on the merge and split rules, a coalition formation algorithm is designed to help each ECD select a group of AVs to form the optimal crowdsensing coalition (OCC) with the target of minimizing the TEC. Finally, we evaluate the TEC of the task and the rewards of the ECDs by comparing the proposed scheme with other schemes. The results show that our scheme can lead to a lower TEC for completing crowdsensing tasks and bring higher rewards to ECDs than the conventional schemes.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9515441,IEEE Internet of Things Journal,2022
Secrecy Energy Efficiency Maximization in UAV-Enabled Wireless Sensor Networks Without Eavesdropper’s CSI,"Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) are anticipated to be a potential data collection solution for wireless sensor networks (WSNs). The main challenges of integrating UAVs in WSNs are security threats and UAV’s onboard energy limitation. To cope with these two challenges, this article examines the secrecy energy efficiency (SEE) maximization problem in UAV-enabled WSN. Specifically, a full-duplex (FD) UAV gathers confidential information from ground sensor nodes (SNs) in the uplink while sending jamming signals to confound a ground eavesdropper (Eve) in the downlink. Considering a passive eavesdropping scenario lacking Eve’s instantaneous channel state information (CSI), the resulting problem is subject to the constraints of connection outage probability (COP), secrecy outage probability (SOP), securely collected bits, and flight trajectory. To tackle the intractable nonconvex problem, we first derive the optimal codeword rate and redundancy rate in closed-form expressions and then develop a low-complexity algorithm using the block coordinate descent (BCD) approach to alternatively optimize the SN scheduling, SN transmit power, UAV transmit power, and UAV trajectory. Simulation results verify the performance gains of the proposed scheme compared with the benchmark schemes. In particular, the proposed scheme achieves nearly the same secrecy rate gains at a lower UAV’s energy consumption cost than the sum secrecy rate maximization (SSRM) baseline. Moreover, it is revealed that trajectory optimization of the proposed scheme plays a crucial role in improving SEE performance compared with the circle trajectory (CT) baseline.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9490362,IEEE Internet of Things Journal,2022
Evaluating Adversarial Attacks on Driving Safety in Vision-Based Autonomous Vehicles,"In recent years, many deep learning models have been adopted in autonomous driving. At the same time, these models introduce new vulnerabilities that may compromise the safety of autonomous vehicles. Specifically, recent studies have demonstrated that adversarial attacks can cause a significant decline in detection precision of deep learning-based 3-D object detection models. Although driving safety is the ultimate concern for autonomous driving, there is no comprehensive study on the linkage between the performance of deep learning models and the driving safety of autonomous vehicles under adversarial attacks. In this article, we investigate the impact of two primary types of adversarial attacks, perturbation attacks, and patch attacks, on the driving safety of vision-based autonomous vehicles rather than the detection precision of deep learning models. In particular, we consider two state-of-the-art models in vision-based 3-D object detection: 1) Stereo R-CNN and 2) DSGN. To evaluate driving safety, we propose an end-to-end evaluation framework with a set of driving safety performance metrics. By analyzing the results of our extensive evaluation experiments, we find that: 1) the attack’s impact on the driving safety of autonomous vehicles and the attack’s impact on the precision of 3-D object detectors are decoupled and 2) the DSGN model demonstrates stronger robustness to adversarial attacks than the Stereo R-CNN model. In addition, we further investigate the causes behind the two findings with an ablation study. The findings of this article provide a new perspective to evaluate adversarial attacks and guide the selection of deep learning models in autonomous driving.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9493770,IEEE Internet of Things Journal,2022
Access Control Protocol for Battlefield Surveillance in Drone-Assisted IoT Environment,"Surveillance drones, called as unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), are aircrafts that are utilized to collect video recordings, still images, or live video of the targets, such as vehicles, people or specific areas. Particularly in battlefield surveillance, there is high possibility of eavesdropping, inserting, modifying or deleting the messages during communications among the deployed drones and ground station server (GSS). This leads to launch several potential attacks by an adversary, such as main-in-middle, impersonation, drones hijacking, replay attacks, etc. Moreover, anonymity and untraceability are two crucial security properties that need to be maintained in battlefield surveillance communication environment. To deal with such a crucial security problem, we propose a new access control protocol for battlefield surveillance in drone-assisted Internet of Things (IoT) environment, called ACPBS-IoT. Through the detailed security analysis using formal and informal (nonmathematical), and also the formal security verification under automated software simulation tool, we show that the proposed ACPBS-IoT can resist several potential attacks needed in a battlefield surveillance scenario. Furthermore, the testbed experiments for various cryptographic primitives have been performed for measuring the execution time. Finally, a detailed comparative study on communication and computational overheads, and security, as well as functionality features, reveals that the proposed ACPBS-IoT provides superior security and more functionality features, and better or comparable overheads than other existing competing access control schemes.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9312672,IEEE Internet of Things Journal,2022
Stochastic Optimization-Aided Energy-Efficient Information Collection in Internet of Underwater Things Networks,"In the face of deeply exploring and exploiting marine resources, the Internet of Underwater Things (IoUT) networks have drawn great attention considering its widely distributed low-cost and easy-deployment smart sensing nodes. However, given the hostile underwater environment, it is critical to conceive energy-efficient information collection because of limited underwater energy supply and inefficient artificial recharge methods. Characterized by high flexibility and maneuverability, autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs) are regarded as a promising solution for information collection in the IoUT relying upon delicate AUVs’ trajectory and information collection strategy design with the spirit of balancing their energy consumption and information processing capability. In this article, we propose a heterogeneous AUV-aided information collection system with the aim of maximizing the energy efficiency of IoUT nodes taking into account AUV trajectory, resource allocation, and the Age of Information (AoI). Moreover, based on the particle swarm optimization (PSO), we obtain the trajectory of AUVs with low time complexity. Additionally, a two-stage joint optimization algorithm based on the Lyapunov optimization is constructed to strike a tradeoff between energy efficiency and system queue backlog iteratively.

Cooperative Control of Physical Collision and Transmission Power for UAV Swarm: A Dual-Fields Enabled Approach,"This article studies the collision avoidance and interference mitigation for unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) swarm where many UAVs track a common target. The considered problem is formulated to jointly minimize the average interference and ensure the collision avoidance among UAVs. By exploiting the problem characteristics, our major contributions are summarized as follows. First, the singular case tolerance (SCT)-artificial potential field (APF) is proposed to overcome the failure of traditional APFs in collision avoidance, where the repulsive force gain coefficient among UAVs is dynamically controlled by the corresponding interferences. Second, the mean-field game (MFG) model is established to control communication power, where the instantaneous interferences among flying UAVs are represented by the mean-field approximation. Third, considering the tight coupling of trajectory and interference of UAVs, a cooperative control approach enabled by dual-fields is proposed to jointly adjust the trajectories and power of UAVs. Simulation results validate the significant performance improvement of the cooperative control approach enabled by dual-fields. Compared with separate APF and MFG, the proposed dual-field-cooperation approach can achieve about 117% throughput gain and 88% interference reduction when the UAV swarm is close to the target.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9481938,IEEE Internet of Things Journal,2022

RAMP-IoD: A Robust Authenticated Key Management Protocol for the Internet of Drones,"Internet of Drones (IoD) is the interconnection of unmanned aerial vehicles or drones deployed for collecting sensitive data to be used in critical applications. The drones transmit the collected data to the control room (CR) for analysis, while CR sends control commands to the drone to monitor their operations. This exchange of information between the drones and CR takes place through a wireless communication channel, which is susceptible to various security risks. Therefore, it is vital to ensure the confidentiality and integrity of such information in the IoD environment. To this end, authenticated key management (AKM) protocols can be leveraged to provide reliable and secure communication. However, due to the peculiarities associated with IoD environments, it is challenging to devise a robust and resource-efficient AKM protocol. To tackle this challenge, in this article, we propose a robust AKM protocol for IoD (RAMP-IoD). RAMP-IoD uses lightweight cryptography-based authenticated encryption primitive and elliptic-curve cryptography along with a hash function to perform the AKM process. Moreover, RAMP-IoD verifies the user’s authenticity and then sets up a session key (SK) between the user and a specific drone for indecipherable communications. We verify the security of SK using the random oracle model. Scyther-based validation demonstrates that RAMP-IoD is protected against replay and man-in-the-middle attacks. Moreover, the informal analysis illustrates that RAMP-IoD is secure against various covert security attacks. Through a comparative study, we also demonstrate that RAMP-IoD provides enhanced security with low storage, communication, and computational overheads as compared to related AKM protocols.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9446966,IEEE Internet of Things Journal,2022
SFNet-N: An Improved SFNet Algorithm for Semantic Segmentation of Low-Light Autonomous Driving Road Scenes,"In recent years, considerable progress has been made in semantic segmentation of images with favorable environments. However, the environmental perception of autonomous driving under adverse weather conditions is still very challenging. In particular, the low visibility at nighttime greatly affects driving safety. In this paper, we aim to explore image segmentation in low-light scenarios, thereby expanding the application range of autonomous vehicles. The segmentation algorithms for road scenes based on deep learning are highly dependent on the volume of images with pixel-level annotations. Considering the scarcity of labeled large-scale nighttime data, we performed synthetic data collection and data style transfer using images acquired in daytime based on the autonomous driving simulation platform and generative adversarial network, respectively. In addition, we also proposed a novel nighttime segmentation framework (SFNET-N) to effectively recognize objects in dark environments, aiming at the boundary blurring caused by low semantic contrast in low-illumination images. Specifically, the framework comprises a light enhancement network which introduces semantic information for the first time and a segmentation network with strong feature extraction capability. Extensive experiments with Dark Zurich-test and Nighttime Driving-test datasets show the effectiveness of our method compared with existing state-of-the art approaches, with 56.9% and 57.4% mIoU (mean of category-wise intersection-over-union) respectively. Finally, we also performed real-vehicle verification of the proposed models in road scenes of Zhenjiang city with poor lighting. The datasets are available at https://github.com/pupu-chenyanyan/semantic-segmentation-on-nightime.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9784832,IEEE Transactions on Intelligent Transportation Systems,2022
Resilient Cooperative Adaptive Cruise Control for Autonomous Vehicles Using Machine Learning,"Cooperative Adaptive Cruise Control (CACC) is a fundamental connected vehicle application that extends Adaptive Cruise Control by exploiting vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) communication. CACC is a crucial ingredient for numerous autonomous vehicle functionalities including platooning, distributed route management, etc. Unfortunately, malicious V2V communications can subvert CACC, leading to string instability and road accidents. In this paper, we develop a novel resiliency infrastructure, RACCON, for detecting and mitigating V2V attacks on CACC. RACCON uses machine learning to develop an on-board prediction model that captures anomalous vehicular responses and performs mitigation in real time. RACCON-enabled vehicles can exploit the high efficiency of CACC without compromising safety, even under potentially adversarial scenarios. We present extensive experimental evaluation to demonstrate the efficacy of RACCON.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9700787,IEEE Transactions on Intelligent Transportation Systems,2022
A3C-Based Intelligent Event-Triggering Control of Networked Nonlinear Unmanned Marine Vehicles Subject to Hybrid Attacks,"This paper is concerned with the intelligent event-triggering-based positioning control of networked unmanned marine vehicle (UMV) systems with hybrid attacks, where the UMV and control station is connected by a communication network and the DoS attack and Deception attack are studied. Firstly, a stochastic switched Takagi-Sugeno (T-S) fuzzy system model is proposed for the networked nonlinear UMV systems subject to aperiodic DoS attack and random Deception attack. Then, a novel asynchronous advantage actor-critic (A3C) learning-based event-triggering approach is introduced to alleviate the communication load. By using the Lyapunov stability theory and switched system analysis method, the mean-square exponential stability condition of the closed-loop system and the design method of observer-based controller are devised. Finally, an example of a networked UMV system is given to verify the effectiveness of the proposed resilient control strategy.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9582736,IEEE Transactions on Intelligent Transportation Systems,2022
Certifiable Robustness to Adversarial State Uncertainty in Deep Reinforcement Learning,"Deep neural network-based systems are now state-of-the-art in many robotics tasks, but their application in safety-critical domains remains dangerous without formal guarantees on network robustness. Small perturbations to sensor inputs (from noise or adversarial examples) are often enough to change network-based decisions, which was recently shown to cause an autonomous vehicle to swerve into another lane. In light of these dangers, numerous algorithms have been developed as defensive mechanisms from these adversarial inputs, some of which provide formal robustness guarantees or certificates. This work leverages research on certified adversarial robustness to develop an online certifiably robust for deep reinforcement learning algorithms. The proposed defense computes guaranteed lower bounds on state-action values during execution to identify and choose a robust action under a worst case deviation in input space due to possible adversaries or noise. Moreover, the resulting policy comes with a certificate of solution quality, even though the true state and optimal action are unknown to the certifier due to the perturbations. The approach is demonstrated on a deep Q-network (DQN) policy and is shown to increase robustness to noise and adversaries in pedestrian collision avoidance scenarios, a classic control task, and Atari Pong. This article extends our prior work with new performance guarantees, extensions to other reinforcement learning algorithms, expanded results aggregated across more scenarios, an extension into scenarios with adversarial behavior, comparisons with a more computationally expensive method, and visualizations that provide intuition about the robustness algorithm.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9354500,IEEE Transactions on Neural Networks and Learning Systems,2022
Blockchain-Empowered Decentralized Horizontal Federated Learning for 5G-Enabled UAVs,"Motivated by Industry 4.0, 5G-enabled unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs; also known as drones) are widely applied in various industries. However, the open nature of 5G networks threatens the safe sharing of data. In particular, privacy leakage can lead to serious losses for users. As a new machine learning paradigm, federated learning (FL) avoids privacy leakage by allowing data models to be shared instead of raw data. Unfortunately, the traditional FL framework is strongly dependent on a centralized aggregation server, which will cause the system to crash if the server is compromised. Unauthorized participants may launch poisoning attacks, thereby reducing the usability of models. In addition, communication barriers hinder collaboration among a large number of cross-domain devices for learning. To address the abovementioned issues, a blockchain-empowered decentralized horizontal FL framework is proposed. The authentication of cross-domain UAVs is accomplished through multisignature smart contracts. Global model updates are computed by using these smart contracts instead of a centralized server. Extensive experimental results show that the proposed scheme achieves high efficiency of cross-domain authentication and good accuracy.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9551794,IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics,2022
Graph-Based Intrusion Detection System for Controller Area Networks,"The controller area network (CAN) is the most widely used intra-vehicular communication network in the automotive industry. Because of its simplicity in design, it lacks most of the requirements needed for a security-proven communication protocol. However, a safe and secured environment is imperative for autonomous as well as connected vehicles. Therefore CAN security is considered one of the important topics in the automotive research community. In this article, we propose a four-stage intrusion detection system that uses the chi-squared method and can detect any kind of strong and weak cyber attacks in a CAN. This work is the first-ever graph-based defense system proposed for the CAN. Our experimental results show that we have a very low 5.26% misclassification for denial of service (DoS) attack, 10% misclassification for fuzzy attack, 4.76% misclassification for replay attack, and no misclassification for spoofing attack. In addition, the proposed methodology exhibits up to 13.73% better accuracy compared to existing ID sequence-based methods.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9210546,IEEE Transactions on Intelligent Transportation Systems,2022
String Stable and Collision-Safe Model Predictive Platoon Control,"Automated vehicle platooning bears high potential to increase traffic efficiency, improve road safety, and reduce fuel consumption. To realize platoons with small inter-vehicle distances, collision safety is the most crucial concern and needs to be considered carefully. Moreover, it is desired to attenuate disturbances along the platoon which is known as string stability. While model predictive control concepts achieve efficient, situation-aware, and safe platooning, establishing string stability properties is difficult. In this work string stability is characterized for a generic feedback setting. A workflow to design an extended time gap spacing policy is proposed for a safety-extended distributed model predictive platooning controller. It provides safe, tightly-packed platoon operation with robust string stability near steady-state even without vehicle-to-vehicle- V2V-communication. Platoon performance is further improved by exploiting V2V-communication. Finally, the resulting closed-loop platoon dynamics are validated in a high-fidelity co-simulation study.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9744601,IEEE Transactions on Intelligent Transportation Systems,2022
Trajectory Planning Based on Spatio-Temporal Map With Collision Avoidance Guaranteed by Safety Strip,"Trajectory planning for the unmanned vehicle in the complex environment has always been a challenging task. Planned trajectory with the corresponding target velocity or acceleration sequence must be collision-free guaranteed and as comfortable as possible on the premise of obeying the traffic rules and interaction with other dynamic social vehicles. To meet this requirement, this paper proposes a framework for trajectory planning based on spatio-temporal map. Due to the time layer architecture in the map, the trajectory can be generated with velocity and acceleration simultaneously, and the whole trajectory is constrained within a ‘safety strip’, resulting in an efficient and safety guaranteed trajectory. The framework is composed of three sections: rough search, fine optimization and safety strip-based collision avoidance. For rough search, we propose an improved A* algorithm implemented in the discrete time layer to find out the suboptimal states efficiently. In fine optimization, the B-spline curve is exploited to connect the searched states into a continuous trajectory. And the optimal control points of B-spline are further grouped into several segments, forming the safety strip which is actually the distribution space of the planned trajectory. If necessary, an adjustment will be applied to keep the strip away from the collision zone, making the entire trajectory completely collision-free. Experiments on both public dataset and self-driving simulator show that the proposed framework can adapt to different kinds of complex traffic scenes well.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9190057,IEEE Transactions on Intelligent Transportation Systems,2022
Minimum-Time Quadrotor Waypoint Flight in Cluttered Environments,"We tackle the problem of planning a minimum-time trajectory for a quadrotor over a sequence of specified waypoints in the presence of obstacles while exploiting the full quadrotor dynamics. This problem is crucial for autonomous search and rescue and drone racing scenarios but was, so far, unaddressed by the robotics community in its entirety due to the challenges of minimizing time in the presence of the non-convex constraints posed by collision avoidance. Early works relied on simplified dynamics or polynomial trajectory representations that did not exploit the full actuator potential of a quadrotor and, thus, did not aim at minimizing time. We address this challenging problem by using a hierarchical, sampling-based method with an incrementally more complex quadrotor model. Our method first finds paths in different topologies to guide subsequent trajectory search for a kinodynamic point-mass model. Then, it uses an asymptotically-optimal, kinodynamic sampling-based method based on a full quadrotor model on top of the point-mass solution to find a feasible trajectory with a time-optimal objective. The proposed method is shown to outperform all related baselines in cluttered environments and is further validated in real-world flights at over 60 km/h in one of the world’s largest motion capture systems. We release the code open source.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9721033,IEEE Robotics and Automation Letters,2022
SHOTS: Scalable Secure Authentication-Attestation Protocol Using Optimal Trajectory in UAV Swarms,"Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) have enabled a broad spectrum of applications serving social, commercial, and military purposes. However, since UAVs use wireless communication technologies, they are highly vulnerable to security threats. Establishing trust with the base station is the most fundamental security aspect in UAV networks to mitigate these threats. However, due to a UAV’s constrained resources, deploying traditional trust establishment schemes in UAV networks becomes challenging. Further, this issue escalates as the number of UAVs increases. To address this issue, we propose an authentication cum attestation protocol for UAV swarms using an optimal communication trajectory, which can establish the required trust in a lightweight manner. Furthermore, our protocol uses Physical Unclonable Functions (PUFs) and thus guarantees physical security as well. We demonstrate that the proposed protocol is feasible, scalable, and secure using a formal Mao Boyd logic approach. Comparative analyses show that the proposed protocol outperforms the state-of-the-art.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9743804,IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology,2022
Intelligent Event-Based Fuzzy Dynamic Positioning Control of Nonlinear Unmanned Marine Vehicles Under DoS Attack,"This article addresses the dynamic positioning control problem of a nonlinear unmanned marine vehicle (UMV) system subject to network communication constraints and deny-of-service (DoS) attack, where the dynamics of UMV are described by a Takagi–Sugeno (T-S) fuzzy system (TSFS). In order to save limited communication resource, a new intelligent event-triggering mechanism is proposed, in which the event triggering threshold is optimized by a  $Q$ -learning algorithm. Then, a switched system approach is proposed to deal with the aperiodic DoS attack occurring in the communication channels. With a proper piecewise Lyapunov function, some sufficient conditions for global exponential stability (GES) of the closed-loop nonlinear UMV system are derived, and the corresponding observer and controller gains are designed via solving a set of matrix inequalities. A benchmark nonlinear UMV system is adopted as an example in simulation, and the simulation results validate the effectiveness of the proposed control method.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9635711,IEEE Transactions on Cybernetics,2022
Event-Triggering and Quantized Sliding Mode Control of UMV Systems Under DoS Attack,"This paper is concerned with security control of nonlinear unmanned marine vehicle (UMV) systems under a networked environment. The UMV system and land-based control station are connected by a communication network. Considering the limited communication resource in the marine environment, the dynamic event-triggering mechanisms are proposed in the sensor to controller and controller to actuator sides simultaneously. Meanwhile, the triggered output data is then quantized by a logarithmic quantizer before being sent to the remote control station. First, based on the Takagi-Sugeno (T-S) fuzzy theory, the nonlinear UMV system is molded as a T-S fuzzy model. Then a hybrid switched fuzzy system is established by taking the DoS attack and quantization effect into account. An observer-based sliding mode control (SMC) scheme is proposed to stabilize the system under DoS attack, and the observer gains and controller gains can be obtained by solving a set of matrix inequalities. Finally, a benchmark UMV system is used to show the effectiveness of control scheme.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9779098,IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology,2022
Event-Based Fault Detection for Unmanned Surface Vehicles Subject to Denial-of-Service Attacks,"In this work, the problem of event-based fault detection is addressed for unmanned surface vehicles (USVs) under denial-of-service (DoS) jamming attacks. A fault detection filter (FDF) is deployed to generate residual for USV systems with external disturbance and system faults. A resilient event-triggered mechanism is implemented to reduce the bandwidth occupation of communication network and energy consumption of USV system as well as mitigating the influence of DoS attacks. Based on the established framework, a switched residual system is constructed and a criterion is deduced to ensure the exponential stability and weighted  $H_{\infty }$  performance of residual system via piecewise Lyapunov functional approach. The FDF and resilient event-triggered mechanism are co-designed. Simulation results are provided to testify the efficient performance of the devised resilient event-triggered fault detection method.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9386148,"IEEE Transactions on Systems, Man, and Cybernetics: Systems",2022
Unmanned Ground Vehicle Platooning Under Cyber Attacks: A Human-Robot Interaction Framework,"In this paper, we propose a human-robot interaction (HRI) framework to reduce the vulnerability of an unmanned ground vehicle (UGV) platoon under cyber attacks. An observer-based autonomous resilient control strategy is first designed to mitigate the effects of vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) cyber attacks. Rigorous proof of the safety conditions of the platoon under V2V cyber attacks is derived. Next, to facilitate human supervision in emergencies and uncertainties, a decision-making aid system is developed, which consists of an anomaly reporting system (ARS), a trust-based information management system (TIMS), and a graphical user interface (GUI). ARS is designed to detect the abnormality of the neighbor UGVs based on the model-based residual generation and analysis. TIMS is developed to rule out information with low trustworthiness, which is fulfilled by a Bayesian-based information pre-processor followed by an enhanced median filter with trustworthiness regulation. It is rigorously proved that TIMS can recover the tempered information under the mild cyber attack scenario autonomously. To deal with unexpected severe vehicle-to-cloud (V2C) cyber attacks, human observations can also be leveraged to bolster the resilience of the TIMS. Representative simulation and humans-in-the-loop experiment (fulfilled by the designed GUI) demonstrate that the proposed framework can effectively guide human operators when working with UGV platoons under cyber attacks. On average, compared to a multi-screen surveillance benchmark approach, the proposed framework can achieve 78.4% decrements of platoon vulnerability and 39.0% decrements in human workload.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9716850,IEEE Transactions on Intelligent Transportation Systems,2022
Daedalus: Breaking Nonmaximum Suppression in Object Detection via Adversarial Examples,"This article demonstrates that nonmaximum suppression (NMS), which is commonly used in object detection (OD) tasks to filter redundant detection results, is no longer secure. Considering that NMS has been an integral part of OD systems, thwarting the functionality of NMS can result in unexpected or even lethal consequences for such systems. In this article, an adversarial example attack that triggers malfunctioning of NMS in OD models is proposed. The attack, namely, Daedalus, compresses the dimensions of detection boxes to evade NMS. As a result, the final detection output contains extremely dense false positives. This can be fatal for many OD applications, such as autonomous vehicles and surveillance systems. The attack can be generalized to different OD models, such that the attack cripples various OD applications. Furthermore, a way of crafting robust adversarial examples is developed by using an ensemble of popular detection models as the substitutes. Considering the pervasive nature of model reuse in real-world OD scenarios, Daedalus examples crafted based on an ensemble of substitutes can launch attacks without knowing the parameters of the victim models. The experimental results demonstrate that the attack effectively stops NMS from filtering redundant bounding boxes. As the evaluation results suggest, Daedalus increases the false positive rate in detection results to 99.9% and reduces the mean average precision scores to 0, while maintaining a low cost of distortion on the original inputs. It also demonstrates that the attack can be practically launched against real-world OD systems via printed posters.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9313033,IEEE Transactions on Cybernetics,2022
Privacy-Preserved Federated Learning for Autonomous Driving,"In recent years, the privacy issue in Vehicular Edge Computing (VEC) has gained a lot of concern. The privacy problem is even more severe in autonomous driving business than the other businesses in VEC such as ordinary navigation. Federated learning (FL), which is a privacy-preserved strategy proposed by Google, has become a hot trend to solve the privacy problem in many fields including VEC. Therefore, we introduce FL into autonomous driving to preserve vehicular privacy by keeping original data in a local vehicle and sharing the training model parameter only with the help of MEC server. Moreover, different from the common assumption of honest MEC server and honest vehicle in former studies, we take the malicious MEC servers and malicious vehicles into account. First, we consider honest-but-curious MEC server and malicious vehicles and propose a traceable identity-based privacy preserving scheme to protect the vehicular message privacy where improved Dijk-Gentry-Halevi-Vaikutanathan (DGHV) algorithm is proposed and a blockchain-based Reputation-based Incentive Autonomous Driving Mechanism (RIADM) is adopted. Further, when the case comes to the non-credibility of both parties where semi-honest MEC server and malicious vehicles are considered, we propose an anonymous identity-based privacy preserving scheme to protect the identity privacy of vehicles with Zero-Knowledge Proof (ZKP). Based on the simulation of virtual autonomous driving based on real-world road images, it is verified that our proposes scheme can reduce 73.7 % training loss of autonomous driving, increase the accuracy to around 5.55 % while keeps effective privacy of message and identity under the threat of dishonest MEC server and vehicles.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9457207,IEEE Transactions on Intelligent Transportation Systems,2022
How to Protect Key Drones in Unmanned Aerial Vehicle Networks? An SDN-Based Topology Deception Scheme,"Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) networks, consisting of flexible, low-cost as well as easily deployable UAVs, have attracted intensive research interest recently. Due to different roles of drones in a network, some drones can be recognized as more important than others. For example, in UAV-assisted wireless sensor networks, drones can be used as store-carry and forward nodes to collect data from sensors and aid communications among them. If UAVs that act as the bridge of a large number of sensors are attacked, the production efficiency will be seriously affected. However, existing work concerning about UAV network security seldom noticed the differences among drones, let alone implementing special measures for protecting key drones. Motivated by this, we focus on the security issue of UAV networks from the perspective of key drones' protection. We first analyze the distinctions of attack impacts when adopting different target selection strategies, revealing that key drones exist and it is significantly important to protect them. Then, a topology deception scheme based on software-defined networking is proposed, which can mitigate the attack impact by tempting attackers through our well-designed virtual topologies, leading to their misjudgments on the key drones. Extensive experimental results illustrate that our scheme can effectively deceive attackers and significantly mitigate the impact of targeted attacks.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9864075,IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology,2022
Real-Time Scheduling of Autonomous Mining Trucks via Flow Allocation-Accelerated Tabu Search,"Material transportation is an essential process in mining operations and accounts for a large portion of total energy consumption. With the development of automation technology, autonomous mining trucks have been deployed in open-pit mines to reduce transportation costs. Compared to manned mining trucks, autonomous trucks are more appropriate for automatic scheduling techniques due to their high informatization, high-precision perception, and sophisticated control. However, the existing truck scheduling research does not exploit autonomous trucks’ strengths to perform more delicate control, but still takes a traditional approach toward autonomous trucks. In this paper, we propose a mixed-integer programming model for joint optimization of autonomous trucks trips and speeds to minimize energy consumption. To solve the proposed scheduling model, a novel tabu search algorithm is proposed, which consists of two parts: an improved flow allocation model with matching factor is formulated in the upper part to determine the optimal truck flow, and in the lower part a tabu search procedure guided with the optimal flow is developed. Based on the mathematical model and solution technique, we also propose a real-time scheduling system of autonomous trucks for the stochastic and dynamic mining environment. A coal mine in Inner Mongolia, China, for example, we verified the effectiveness of the proposed truck scheduling model and real-time scheduling approach. We demonstrate that the proposed allocation model effectively accelerates the tabu search procedure, and for short-term decisions, the proposed solution technique satisfies the computational requirements of the real-time scheduling system.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9756288,IEEE Transactions on Intelligent Vehicles,2022
Adversarial Game Against Hybrid Attacks in UAV Communications With Partial Information,"Unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) communications are vulnerable to smart attacks, where the attacker can change the attack mode (e.g., eavesdropping and jamming) via smart radio devices. To ensure secure transmissions against hybrid attacks, UAVs may transmit confidential information and misleading information alternately. In this paper, we consider a dynamic anti-hybrid attack framework with trajectory optimization, where both a UAV and an attacker attempt to find their optimal trajectories without knowing the information type and the attack mode of each other. Given the major challenge due to incomplete knowledge (i.e., each agent knows only its own information), we establish an adversarial game with partial-observation feature to formulate an optimization problem, and propose a counterfactual regret minimization learning scheme to achieve the correlated equilibrium for both the UAV and attacker. Simulation results validate the superiority of our scheme over a benchmark in UAV communication scenarios with partial information.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9640491,IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology,2022
A Survey on Attack Detection and Resilience for Connected and Automated Vehicles: From Vehicle Dynamics and Control Perspective,"Recent advances in attack/anomaly detection and resilience strategies for connected and automated vehicles (CAVs) are reviewed from vehicle dynamics and control perspective. Compared to traditional vehicles, CAVs are featured in the increasing number of perception sensors, advanced intra-vehicle communication technologies, capabilities of driving automation and connectivity between single vehicles. These features bring about safety issues which are not encountered in traditional vehicle systems. One main type of these issues is the attack or anomaly launched onto the perception sensors and the communication channels. With such a consideration, this survey summarizes and reviews the existing results on attack/anomaly detection and resilience of CAVs in control frameworks. This paper reviews the results according to the positions at which the attacks/anomalies occur. These positions are divided into three categories, namely, intra-vehicle communication network, perception sensors and inter-vehicle communication network. From this perspective, the recent attack/anomaly detection and resilience results are reviewed according to different positions attacked.

MTH-IDS: A Multitiered Hybrid Intrusion Detection System for Internet of Vehicles,"Modern vehicles, including connected vehicles and autonomous vehicles, nowadays involve many electronic control units connected through intravehicle networks (IVNs) to implement various functionalities and perform actions. Modern vehicles are also connected to external networks through vehicle-to-everything technologies, enabling their communications with other vehicles, infrastructures, and smart devices. However, the improving functionality and connectivity of modern vehicles also increase their vulnerabilities to cyber-attacks targeting both intravehicle and external networks due to the large attack surfaces. To secure vehicular networks, many researchers have focused on developing intrusion detection systems (IDSs) that capitalize on machine learning methods to detect malicious cyber-attacks. In this article, the vulnerabilities of intravehicle and external networks are discussed, and a multitiered hybrid IDS that incorporates a signature-based IDS and an anomaly-based IDS is proposed to detect both known and unknown attacks on vehicular networks. Experimental results illustrate that the proposed system can detect various types of known attacks with 99.99% accuracy on the CAN-intrusion-dataset representing the IVN data and 99.88% accuracy on the CICIDS2017 data set illustrating the external vehicular network data. For the zero-day attack detection, the proposed system achieves high F1-scores of 0.963 and 0.800 on the above two data sets, respectively. The average processing time of each data packet on a vehicle-level machine is less than 0.6 ms, which shows the feasibility of implementing the proposed system in real-time vehicle systems. This emphasizes the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed IDS.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9443234,IEEE Internet of Things Journal,2022
Secure Privacy-Preserving V2V Communication in 5G-V2X Supporting Network Slicing,"As autonomous driving technology continues to develop, communication for vehicles is becoming more important to provide an efficient and secure driving environment. Currently, vehicle-to-everything (V2X) based on fifth-generation (5G) is the only solution to meet the demanding requirements of self-driving cars in terms of ultra-low latency and ultra-high reliable connectivity under high mobility conditions, earning this technology more attention. Secure communication for vehicle-to-vehicle based on 5G (5G-V2V) is essential because vehicles decide how to maneuver and perceive situations based on the data exchanged. In this paper, we not only propose a new architecture for V2X based on 5G (5G-V2X) by utilizing network slicing (NS) to guarantee different features of V2X services but also analyze security requirements according to V2X service type. We also propose a secure V2V communication scheme based on 5G that satisfies these requirements. The security evaluation demonstrates that our scheme is secure against attacks on a V2V environment via both security proof and verification tool ProVerif. Through the performance evaluation, we prove that our scheme is more effective than the existing schemes while meeting end-to-end delay requirements for autonomous driving.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9632277,IEEE Transactions on Intelligent Transportation Systems,2022
A New Modeling Approach for Predicting Vehicle-Based Safety Threats,"Existing autonomous driving systems of intelligent vehicles such as advanced driver assistant systems (ADAS) assess and quantify the level of potential safety threats. However, they may not be able to plan the best response to unexpected dangerous situations and do not have the ability to cope with uncertainties since not all vehicles can always keep a safe gap from preceding vehicles and drive at a desired velocity. Previous research has not taken such uncertainties into account, it is, therefore, necessary to develop models which are not restricted by the predefined movement patterns of a vehicle. Existing systems are based on a model that estimates the threat level based only on one factor Time-To-Collision (TTC). This approach is limited since it cannot handle all scenarios and ignores all uncertainties. To overcome these limitations, this paper utilised deep learning to develop a range of models that rely on a group of factors to reliably estimate the threat level and predict conflicts under uncertainty using the concept of looming ’. Comparative analyses were undertaken by incorporating new varying input factors to each model (e.g., surrogate safety measures, vehicle kinematics, macroscopic traffic data). Real-world experiments demonstrated that adding new factors increases the reliability and sensitivity of the models. Results also indicated that the models that consider looming provide low false alarm rate extending their applications for a wider spectrum of traffic scenarios. This is paramount for ADAS as uncertainties are inherent in the deployment of connected and autonomous vehicles in a mixed traffic stream.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9733966,IEEE Transactions on Intelligent Transportation Systems,2022
Hybrid-Learning-Based Driver Steering Intention Prediction Using Neuromuscular Dynamics,"The emerging automated driving technology poses a new challenge to driver-automation collaboration, which requires a mutual understanding between humans and machines through their intention identifications. In this article, oriented by human–machine mutual understanding, a driver steering intention prediction method is proposed to better understand human driver's expectation during driver–vehicle interaction. The steering intention is predicted based on a novel hybrid-learning-based time-series model with deep learning networks. Two different driving modes, namely, both hands and single right-hand driving modes, are studied. Different electromyography signals from the upper limb muscles are collected and used for the steering intention prediction. The relationship between the neuromuscular dynamics and the steering torque is analyzed first. Then, the hybrid-learning-based model is developed to predict both the continuous and discrete steering intentions. The two intention prediction networks share the same temporal pattern exaction layer, which is built with the bidirectional recurrent neural network and long short-term memory cells. The model prediction performance is evaluated with a varied history and prediction horizon to exploit the model capability further. The experimental data are collected from 21 participants of varied ages and driving experience. The results show that the proposed method can achieve a prediction accuracy of around 95% steering under the two driving modes.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9361419,IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics,2022
Hazardous Scenario Enhanced Generation for Automated Vehicle Testing Based on Optimization Searching Method,"The scenario-based test method is the research hotspot of automated vehicle (AV) validation and verification (V&V), and testing with hazardous scenarios is of important means. An Optimization Searching (OS) method for enhanced generation in hazardous scenarios is proposed in this paper to efficiently explore functional boundary scenarios in a huge logical state space. The method is computationally tractable, and its generated experimental parameters are optimized using past test results. The method includes five essential modules. The Exploration and Exploitation module uses the Multi-arm bandit method to obtain the greatest sum of the  $TTC^{\mathbf {-1}}$  (Time To Collision). The Parameter Moving Probability Determination module uses an analytic hierarchy process to ensure that influential parameters are more likely to move. The Step Size Determination module is built with Levy-step to find a greater number of hazardous scenarios. The Memory Function module is used to avoid repeat experiments that can reduce computing efficiency. The Result Analysis module creates a hazard parameter space for subsequent tests. We tested an ACC (Adaptive Cruise Control) algorithm with a specified logical scenario in the virtual environment built by PreScan. The results showed that the OS method can effectively discover the dangerous range with the tested ACC algorithm, and its test speed can reach more than five times that of an exhaustive algorithm without prior knowledge.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9394813,IEEE Transactions on Intelligent Transportation Systems,2022
A Survey on Cyber-Security of Connected and Autonomous Vehicles (CAVs),"As the general development trend of the automotive industry, connected and autonomous vehicles (CAVs) can be used to increase transportation safety, promote mobility choices, reduce user costs, and create new job opportunities. However, with the increasing level of connectivity and automation, malicious users are able to easily implement different kinds of attacks, which threaten the security of CAVs. Hence, this paper provides a comprehensive survey on the cyber-security in the environment of CAVs with the aim of highlighting security problems and challenges. Firstly, based on the types of communication networks and attack objects, it classifies various cyber-security risks and vulnerabilities in the environment of CAVs into in-vehicle network attacks, vehicle to everything network attacks, and other attacks. Next, it regards cyber-risk as another type of attacks in the environment of CAVs. Then, it describes and analyzes up-to-date corresponding defense strategies for securing CAVs. In addition, it concludes several available cyber-security and safety standards of CAVs, which is helpful for the practical application of CAVs. Finally, several challenges and open problems are discussed for the future research.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9447840,IEEE Transactions on Intelligent Transportation Systems,2022
Blockchain-Integrated Multiagent Deep Reinforcement Learning for Securing Cooperative Adaptive Cruise Control,"Connected and Autonomous Vehicles (CAVs) are an emerging solution to the issues of safe and sustainable transportation systems in the future. One major transport technology for CAVs is Cooperative Adaptive Cruise Control (CACC), for which unsignalized autonomous intersection crossing is a growing use case. CACC relies heavily on inter-vehicular communication and is thus vulnerable to message forgery and jamming attacks. Most solutions for CACC focus exclusively on enhancing efficiency or security but do not offer an integrated framework for achieving both on a large scale. In this paper, we propose a Blockchain-integrated Multi-Agent Deep Reinforcement Learning (Block-MADRL) architecture for enhancing the efficiency of CACC while cooperatively detecting attacks, reducing the fuel efficiency of identified attackers and securely notifying the overall network. Our approach uses multi-agent deep reinforcement learning to find fuel and throughput optimizing solutions for CACC and a cooperative verification mechanism based on Extended Isolation Forest (EIF) for attack detection. Attacker data is securely stored in a Road Side Unit (RSU) level blockchain, and we design a low-latency, high throughput consensus protocol for speedy and secure data dissemination. Simulation results indicate over 29.5% better lane throughput with our approach during acceleration forgery attack, up to 23% induced reduction in fuel efficiency of malicious vehicles, 17.6% higher blockchain throughput through our consensus protocol and over 8% improvement in attack detection rate compared to the state-of-the-art.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9765784,IEEE Transactions on Intelligent Transportation Systems,2022
A Semidistributed Interior Point Algorithm for Optimal Coordination of Automated Vehicles at Intersections,"In this article, we consider the optimal coordination of automated vehicles at intersections under fixed crossing orders. We formulate the problem using direct optimal control and exploit the structure to construct a semidistributed primal-dual interior-point algorithm to solve it by parallelizing most of the computations. Differently from standard distributed optimization algorithms, where the optimization problem is split, in our approach we split the linear algebra steps, such that the algorithm takes the same steps as a fully centralized one, while still performing computations in a distributed fashion. We analyze the communication requirements of the algorithm, and propose an approximation scheme which can significantly reduce the data exchange. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the algorithm in hard but realistic scenarios, which show that the approximation leads to reductions in communicated data of almost 99% of the exact formulation, at the expense of less than 1% suboptimality.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9658226,IEEE Transactions on Control Systems Technology,2022
Saliency Heat-Map as Visual Attention for Autonomous Driving Using Generative Adversarial Network (GAN),"The ability to sense and understanding the driving environment is a key technology for ADAS and autonomous driving. Human drivers have to pay more visual attention to important or target elements and ignore unnecessary ones present in their field of sight. A model that computes this visual attention of targets in a specific driving environment is essential and useful in supporting autonomous driving, object-specific tracking & detection, driving training, car collision warning, traffic sign detection, etc. In this paper, we propose a new framework of visual attention that can predict important objects in the driving scene using a conditional generative adversarial network. A large scale Visual Attention Driving Database (VADD) of saliency heat-maps is built from existing driving datasets using a saliency mechanism. The proposed framework model takes its strength from these saliency heat-maps as conditioning label variables. The results show that the proposed approach makes us able to predict heat-maps of most important objects in a driving environment.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9349146,IEEE Transactions on Intelligent Transportation Systems,2022
Multi-Helper NOMA for Cooperative Mobile Edge Computing,"The next-generation wireless networks are expected to support a number of computation-intensive and delay-sensitive applications such as virtual reality (VR), autonomous driving, telesurgery and unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs). Since many devices are computation and power limited, mobile edge computing (MEC) has been deemed as a promising way to enhance computation service. In this paper, we propose a novel cooperative MEC that exploits the combination of non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) and multiple helpers. In the proposed system featuring a user, multiple helpers and a base station (BS), the user can simultaneously offload its computation-intensive tasks to the helpers using NOMA when there is no strong direct transmission link between the user and the BS. Then, the helpers can compute and offload these tasks through NOMA. Thus, in the proposed scheme, the computation and offloading modes at the helpers are determined with respect to the optimized task offloading decision factor. The simulation results show that the proposed NOMA-based cooperative MEC significantly increases the total offloading data under the latency constraints compared to the benchmark schemes featuring one helper with strong direct transmission link.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9566305,IEEE Transactions on Intelligent Transportation Systems,2022
Machine Learning-Empowered Beam Management for mmWave-NOMA in Multi-UAVs Networks,"We consider a mission-driven multiple unmanned aerial vehicles (multi-UAVs) network with millimeter-wave (mmWave) transmissions, where a leader UAV (LUAV) communicates with a large number of follower UAVs (FUAVs) simultaneously via a uniform planar array with only a limited number of radio frequency chains. Since only a few orthogonal beams are available and mission-driven UAV networks are autonomous and delay-sensitive, non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) over these beams is considered for agility and efficiency. In particular, aiming to address these challenges of highly dynamic mobility, we propose a machine learning framework to enable agile analog beam management for mmWave-NOMA transmissions. The proposed beam management aims to achieve efficient beam tracking and NOMA-grouping-aware analog beamforming optimization to facilitate mmWave-NOMA transmissions by judiciously utilizing angular domain information (ADI). More specifically, a Gaussian process machine learning-based ADI prediction scheme is proposed to track the angular dynamics of FUAVs, which facilitates fast beam-tracking for mmWave-NOMA transmissions. Moreover, by exploiting the predicted ADI, an unsupervised-learning-based FUAV grouping scheme is proposed to facilitate mmWave-NOMA transmissions with high radio-frequency chain efficiency, while a deep learning-based NOMA-grouping-aware fast transmit beamforming optimization scheme is proposed to improve the coverage of mmWave-NOMA transmissions in highly dynamic multi-UAVs networks. Simulation results validate the performance advantages of our proposed beam management scheme against state-of-the-art schemes.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9773960,IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology,2022
Pre-Predictive Congestion-Based Data Allocation for Sixth Generation Cooperative Intelligent Transportation Systems,"Cooperative intelligent and autonomous transportation systems rely on intelligent sensing, computing, and actuating technologies for unmanned freight and public movements. The information gained from neighbors and communication infrastructures provides efficient actuation for safe and sustained transportation. This article resolves traffic data management congestion using sixth-generation (6G) communication and computing techniques. Terahertz and machine-type communications are exploited for swift information exchange, bypassing the congestion effects. Congestion occurs when demand for road space exceeds supply. This proposal incorporates prediction-based learning to compute the feasibility of handling traffic information and cooperative intelligent transportation. This model is named Congestion-aware Pre-predictive Data Allocation (CPPDA). The traffic flows causing congestion in the data exchange process are predicted for re-allocation and independent channel utilization. In this learning, the pre-predicted instances are updated with the actual identified utilization-to-congestion rate. Therefore, the congestion-causing channels for sensing are identified with ease, reducing the outage. The outage is examined for a basic inter-vehicle data link. Through the optimal allocation of channels for actuation, cloud-aided resources are utilized to a maximum level, leveraging infrastructure support. In addition to an outage of 10.83%, the response time of 14.75%, congestion factor of 8.2%, computational overhead of 6.4%, and information gain factors of 6.86% are analyzed through a comparative study.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9899366,IEEE Transactions on Intelligent Transportation Systems,2022
Reachability Analysis of Cyber-Physical Systems Under Stealthy Attacks,"This article studies the reachable set of cyber-physical systems subject to stealthy attacks with the Kullback–Leibler divergence adopted to describe the stealthiness. The reachable set is defined as the set in which both the system state and the estimation error of the Kalman filter reside with a certain probability. The necessary and sufficient conditions of the reachable set being unbounded are given for the finite and infinite time cases, respectively. When the reachable set is bounded, an ellipsoidal outer approximation is obtained by solving a convex optimization problem. An application of this approximation to the safety evaluation is also given. A numerical simulation of an unmanned ground vehicle is presented to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9244223,IEEE Transactions on Cybernetics,2022
A Cloud-Assisted Reliable Trust Computing Scheme for Data Collection in Internet of Things,"Large number of Internet of Things (IoT) applications with intelligent sensing devices (ISDs) are combined with cloud computing to collect and process data more efficiently. However, ISDs are vulnerable to various attacks. Compromised devices may maliciously provide unreliable data to the cloud, causing damage to IoT applications. Therefore, it is a critical issue to design an effective mechanism to ensure the security of data collection in cloud computing. In this article, a cloud-assisted reliable trust computing (CRTC) scheme is proposed to identify the trust of ISDs at low cost, providing high-quality data for IoT applications. The CRTC scheme mainly includes the following parts: First, a reliable approach of obtaining the real data of ISDs at a low cost is proposed to identify the trust of ISDs. In the proposed method, ISDs fits the forwarding packets information to form inspection information (II) with a small amount of data and then sends II to inspection nodes, effectively reducing the cost of routing II. Second, an effective method of trust computing is given to evaluate the trustworthiness of ISDs based on the data and II collected by unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV). Then, the aggregators are selected from high-trust ISDs to ensure secure data collection. Third, to obtain more reliable trust at lower cost, a trajectory optimization algorithm for UAV is proposed to collect as much II as possible and reduce the moving distance. Theoretical analysis and experimental results show that the proposed CRTC scheme is superior to previous strategies in terms of the success rate of data collection, the speed of identifying the trust of ISDs, and the UAV's trajectory distance.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9525252,IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics,2022
Security Energy Efficiency Analysis of Analog Collaborative Beamforming With Stochastic Virtual Antenna Array of UAV Swarm,"To extend the transmission range governed by limited transmit power, collaborative beamforming (CB) can be employed with a virtual antenna array (VAA) constructed by an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) swarm. CB techniques combined with physical layer security (PLS) algorithms are known to better secure transmissions of sensitive information in the presence of eavesdropping attacks, compared to co-located antenna-based schemes. In particular, analog collaborative beamforming (ACB) with random VAA topologies, which is suitable for UAV networks due to its lower signaling/channel estimation overhead compared to the digital CB, can provide a significantly higher secrecy rate by creating noise-like signals at eavesdroppers. However, the increase in energy consumption to improve secrecy rate had been ignored in the existing ACB-based PLS schemes, which is of paramount importance considering the limited onboard energy of UAVs. Thus, motivated by such limitation, in this paper, we examine the security energy efficiency of the ACB-based PLS technique, where a group of UAVs (or VAA elements) randomly change their locations in a distributed manner to randomize the array factor of the VAA, i.e., a stochastic VAA. The proposed stochastic VAA outperforms the existing static VAA in terms of secrecy energy efficiency as verified by analytic and numerical results. Further, the impact of phase errors of the proposed scheme is also presented, which indicates the significance of the accurate phase estimation.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9765707,IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology,2022
SSPNet: Scale Selection Pyramid Network for Tiny Person Detection From UAV Images,"With the increasing demand for search and rescue, it is highly demanded to detect objects of interest in large-scale images captured by unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), which is quite challenging due to extremely small scales of objects. Most existing methods employed a feature pyramid network (FPN) to enrich shallow layers’ features by combining deep layers’ contextual features. However, under the limitation of the inconsistency in gradient computation across different layers, the shallow layers in FPN are not fully exploited to detect tiny objects. In this article, we propose a scale selection pyramid network (SSPNet) for tiny person detection, which consists of three components: context attention module (CAM), scale enhancement module (SEM), and scale selection module (SSM). CAM takes account of context information to produce hierarchical attention heatmaps. SEM highlights features of specific scales at different layers, leading the detector to focus on objects of specific scales instead of vast backgrounds. SSM exploits adjacent layers’ relationships to fulfill suitable feature sharing between deep layers and shallow layers, thereby avoiding the inconsistency in gradient computation across different layers. Besides, we propose a weighted negative sampling (WNS) strategy to guide the detector to select more representative samples. Experiments on the TinyPerson benchmark show that our method outperforms other state-of-the-art (SOTA) detectors.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9515145,IEEE Geoscience and Remote Sensing Letters,2022
Joint Altitude and Hybrid Beamspace Precoding Optimization for UAV-Enabled Multiuser mmWave MIMO System,"The combination of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) and millimeter wave (mmWave) multiple-input multiple-out (MIMO) system is regarded as a key enabling technology for beyond 5G networks, as it provides high data rate aerial links. However, establishing UAV-enabled mmWave MIMO communication is quite challenging due to the high hardware cost in terms of radio frequency (RF) chains. As a cost-effective alternative, a beamspace precoding with discrete lens arrays (DLA) architecture has received considerable attention. However, the underlying optimal design in beamspace precoding has not been fully exploited in UAV-enabled communication scenario. In this paper, the joint design of the UAV’s altitude and hybrid beamspace precoding is proposed for the UAV-enabled multiuser MIMO system, in which the DLA is exploited to reduce the number of the RF chain. In the proposed scheme, the optimization problem is formulated as a minimum weighted mean squared error (MWMSE) method. Then an efficient algorithm with the penalty dual decomposition (PDD) is proposed that aims to jointly optimize the altitude of UAV, beam selection and digital precoding matrices. Simulation results confirm the comparable performance of the proposed scheme and perform close to full-digital beamforming in terms of achievable spectral efficiency.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9648018,IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology,2022
FAST-LIO2: Fast Direct LiDAR-Inertial Odometry,"This article presents FAST-LIO2: a fast, robust, and versatile LiDAR-inertial odometry framework. Building on a highly efficient tightly coupled iterated Kalman filter, FAST-LIO2 has two key novelties that allow fast, robust, and accurate LiDAR navigation (and mapping). The first one is directly registering raw points to the map (and subsequently update the map, i.e., mapping) without extracting features. This enables the exploitation of subtle features in the environment and, hence, increases the accuracy. The elimination of a hand-engineered feature extraction module also makes it naturally adaptable to emerging LiDARs of different scanning patterns; the second main novelty is maintaining a map by an incremental k-dimensional (k-d) tree data structure, incremental k-d tree (ikd-Tree), that enables incremental updates (i.e., point insertion and delete) and dynamic rebalancing. Compared with existing dynamic data structures (octree, R$^\ast$-tree, and nanoflann k-d tree), ikd-Tree achieves superior overall performance while naturally supports downsampling on the tree. We conduct an exhaustive benchmark comparison in 19 sequences from a variety of open LiDAR datasets. FAST-LIO2 achieves consistently higher accuracy at a much lower computation load than other state-of-the-art LiDAR-inertial navigation systems. Various real-world experiments on solid-state LiDARs with small field of view are also conducted. Overall, FAST-LIO2 is computationally efficient (e.g., up to 100 Hz odometry and mapping in large outdoor environments), robust (e.g., reliable pose estimation in cluttered indoor environments with rotation up to 1000 deg/s), versatile (i.e., applicable to both multiline spinning and solid-state LiDARs, unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) and handheld platforms, and Intel- and ARM-based processors), while still achieving a higher accuracy than existing methods. Our implementation of the system FAST-LIO2 and the data structure ikd-Tree are both open-sourced on Github.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9697912,IEEE Transactions on Robotics,2022
Service-Oriented Real-Time Energy-Optimal Regenerative Braking Strategy for Connected and Autonomous Electrified Vehicles,"This paper presents a real-time vehicle speed planning system called the real-time energy-optimal deceleration planning system (RT-EDPS). Connectivity and autonomous driving technologies that provide map and navigation data, traffic light information, and front detection sensor data are exploited to perceive and forecast upcoming deceleration events. A parameterized polynomial-based deceleration model is employed as the deceleration strategy. Real driving test data that characterize the physical limits of regenerative braking are used to model the objective function and constraints of the parameterized deceleration commands. The proposed RT-EDPS involves two speed-planning strategies with different scales of the planning horizon. Within a deceleration event horizon ascertained by the signal phase and timing data of traffic signals and 3D geographic map data, a dynamic programming-based energy-efficient deceleration strategy is used to generate long-sighted speed profiles. While the scheduled vehicle speed is being tracked, if a preceding vehicle is detected within a predefined threshold range, then a model predictive control-based energy-efficient deceleration strategy that incorporates the traffic status ahead of the ego vehicle and exploits V2V communication with the preceding vehicles is activated to re-plan the speed trajectory of the vehicle to guarantee a collision-free distance for the preceding vehicle. In virtual driving experiments, we record energy-recuperation efficiency gains of over 40% as compared to human drivers.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9507047,IEEE Transactions on Intelligent Transportation Systems,2022
Chiller Fault Diagnosis Based on VAE-Enabled Generative Adversarial Networks,"Artificial intelligence (AI)-enhanced automated fault diagnosis (AFD) has become increasingly popular for chiller fault diagnosis with promising classification performance. In practice, a sufficient number of fault samples are required by the AI methods in the training phase. However, faulty training samples are generally much more difficult to be collected than normal training samples. Data augmentation is introduced in these scenarios to enhance the training data set with synthetic data. In this study, a variational autoencoder-based conditional Wasserstein GAN with gradient penalty (CWGAN-GP-VAE) is proposed to diagnose various faults for chillers. A detailed comparative study has been conducted with real-world fault data samples to verify the effectiveness and robustness of the proposed methodology. Note to Practitioners—This work attacks the fact that faulty training samples are usually much harder to be collected than the normal training samples in the practice of chiller automated fault diagnosis (AFD). Modern supervised learning chiller AFD relies on a sufficient number of faulty training samples to train the classifier. When the number of faulty training samples is insufficient, the conventional AFD methods fail to work. This study proposed a variational autoencoder-based conditional Wasserstein GAN with gradient penalty (CWGAN-GP-VAE) framework for generating synthetic faulty training samples to enrich the training data set for machine learning-based AFD methods. The proposed algorithm has been carefully designed, implemented, and practically proved to be more effective than the existing methods in the literature.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9264218,IEEE Transactions on Automation Science and Engineering,2022
PERFECT: Positional-Forgery Resistant Traffic Gap Estimation for Connected Intersection Management,"Connected and Autonomous Vehicles (CAVs) are set to be the next global revolution in transportation. One of the major challenges in a CAV environment is handling the positional-forgery of Basic Safety Messages while calculating critical traffic gaps at a Stop Sign Gap Assist controlled intersection. Traditionally, positional-forgery has been handled by isolated instances of physical layer detection and correction mechanisms, which proved unreliable during the multi-hop and majority malicious vehicle scenarios. In this work, we propose a novel framework called Positional-forgEry Resistant traFfic gap Estimation for Connected inTersection management (PERFECT) that performs optimal traffic gap estimation even during multi-hop scenarios and majority malicious positional-forgery attacks. The framework reduces traffic gap estimation error during majority malicious scenarios by over 60%, keeps the average error within 8.17%–10.62% and minimizes the maximum error across a range of malicious situations.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9773976,IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology,2022
Threat sequencing of multiple UCAVs with incomplete information based on game theory,"The threat sequencing of multiple unmanned combat air vehicles (UCAVs) is a multi-attribute decision-making (MADM) problem. In the threat sequencing process of multiple UCAVs, due to the strong confrontation and high dynamics of the air combat environment, the weight coefficients of the threat indicators are usually time-varying. Moreover, the air combat data is difficult to be obtained accurately. In this study, a threat sequencing method of multiple UCAVs is proposed based on game theory by considering the incomplete information. Firstly, a zero-sum game model of decision maker ($\mathcal{D}$) and nature ($\mathcal{N}$) with fuzzy payoffs is established to obtain the uncertain parameters which are the weight coefficient parameters of the threat indicators and the interval parameters of the threat matrix. Then, the established zero-sum game with fuzzy payoffs is transformed into a zero-sum game with crisp payoffs (matrix game) to solve. Moreover, a decision rule is addressed for the threat sequencing problem of multiple UCAVs based on the obtained uncertain parameters. Finally, numerical simulation results are presented to show the effectiveness of the proposed approach.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9885010,Journal of Systems Engineering and Electronics,2022
AdaptIDS: Adaptive Intrusion Detection for Mission-Critical Aerospace Vehicles,"Aerospace and defense industries are particularly vulnerable to cyber threats given their sensitive nature, significantly extending the consequences of security breaches to the national level. Aerospace vehicles are augmented by cooperative control, intelligent, connected, and autonomous systems. The risk against such systems is further amplified due to commonly relying on the MIL-STD-1553 communication bus developed with a high focus on reliability and fault tolerance, albeit with security as a second priority. MIL-STD-1553 (a.k.a., STANAG 3838 by NATO) is a standard that describes a serial data communication bus primarily used in aerospace vehicles for military and civilian applications, including avionics, aircraft, and spacecraft data handling. In the absence of core security measures such as authentication, authorization, and encryption, the bus connecting sensitive functions, including autopilot, GPS, fuel valve switches, and other avionics equipment, is easily vulnerable to a wide range of attacks. This paper proposes, AdaptIDS, a novel adaptive intrusion detection system as a security analytics framework for the MIL-STD-1553 communication bus. AdaptIDS mainly adopts data science principles and leverages advanced deep learning techniques (i.e., the stacking ensemble) to boost its generalization capabilities for detecting unseen patterns of attacks in the dynamic changing environment of aerospace vehicles. Extensive experiments are conducted using two datasets generated from an open-source simulation system, reflecting dynamic real-life scenarios. The evaluation results demonstrate that our solution outperforms existing solutions with high detection effectiveness of 0.99 F1-measure and computational time efficiency.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9928421,IEEE Transactions on Intelligent Transportation Systems,2022
A Sequential Algorithm for Jerk Limited Speed Planning,"In this article, we discuss a sequential algorithm for the computation of a minimum-time speed profile over a given path, under velocity, acceleration, and jerk constraints. Such a problem arises in industrial contexts, such as automated warehouses, where LGVs need to perform assigned tasks as fast as possible in order to increase productivity. It can be reformulated as an optimization problem with a convex objective function, linear velocity and acceleration constraints, and nonconvex jerk constraints, which, thus, represent the main source of the difficulty. While existing nonlinear programming (NLP) solvers can be employed for the solution of this problem, it turns out that the performance and robustness of such solvers can be enhanced by the sequential line-search algorithm proposed in this article. At each iteration, a feasible direction, with respect to the current feasible solution, is computed, and a step along such direction is taken in order to compute the next iterate. The computation of the feasible direction is based on the solution of a linearized version of the problem, and the solution of the linearized problem, through an approach that strongly exploits its special structure, represents the main contribution of this work. The efficiency of the proposed approach with respect to existing NLP solvers is proven through different computational experiments. Note to Practitioners—This article was motivated by the needs of LGV manufacturers. In particular, it presents an algorithm for computing the minimum-time speed law for an LGV along a preassigned path, respecting assigned velocity, acceleration, and jerk constraints. The solution algorithm should be: 1) fast, since speed planning is made continuously throughout the workday, not only when an LGV receives a new task but also during the execution of the task itself, since conditions may change, e.g., if the LGV has to be halted for security reasons and 2) reliable, i.e., it should return solutions of high quality, because a better speed profile allows to save time and even small percentage improvements, say a 5% improvement, has a considerable impact on the productivity of the warehouse, and, thus, determines a significant economic gain. The algorithm that we propose meets these two requirements, and we believe that it can be a useful tool for LGV manufacturers and users. It is obvious that the proposed method also applies to the speed planning problem for vehicles other than LGVs, e.g., road vehicles.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9566295,IEEE Transactions on Automation Science and Engineering,2022
Federated Feature Selection for Cyber-Physical Systems of Systems,"Autonomous vehicles (AVs) generate a massive amount of multi-modal data that once collected and processed through Machine Learning algorithms, enable AI-based services at the Edge. In fact, only a subset of the collected data present informative attributes to be exploited at the Edge. Therefore, extracting such a subset is of utmost importance to limit computation and communication workloads. Doing that in a distributed manner imposes the AVs to cooperate in finding an agreement on which attributes should be sent to the Edge. In this work, we address such a problem by proposing a federated feature selection (FFS) algorithm where the AVs collaborate to filter out, iteratively, the less relevant attributes in a distributed manner, without any exchange of raw data, thought two different components: a Mutual-Information-based feature selection algorithm run by the AVs and a novel aggregation function based on the Bayes theorem executed on the Edge. The FFS algorithm has been tested on two reference datasets: MAV with images and inertial measurements of a monitored vehicle, WESAD with a collection of samples from biophysical sensors to monitor a relative passenger. The numerical results show that the AVs converge to a minimum achievable subset of features with both the datasets, i.e., 24 out of 2166 (99%) in MAV and 4 out of 8 (50%) in WESAD, respectively, preserving the informative content of data.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9783110,IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology,2022
FSNet: A Failure Detection Framework for Semantic Segmentation,"Semantic segmentation is an important task that helps autonomous vehicles understand their surroundings and navigate safely. However, during deployment, even the most mature segmentation models are vulnerable to various external factors that can degrade the segmentation performance with potentially catastrophic consequences for the vehicle and its surroundings. To address this issue, we propose a failure detection framework to identify pixel-level misclassification. We do so by exploiting internal features of the segmentation model and training it simultaneously with a failure detection network. During deployment, the failure detector flags areas in the image where the segmentation model has failed to segment correctly. We evaluate the proposed approach against state-of-the-art methods and achieve 12.30%, 9.46%, and 9.65% performance improvement in the AUPR-Error metric for Cityscapes, BDD100k, and Mapillary semantic segmentation datasets.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9682519,IEEE Robotics and Automation Letters,2022
Valve Detection for Autonomous Water Pipeline Inspection Platform,"Water distribution and transmission lines are indispensable to urban infrastructure. The water pipelines are subject to both structural and functional deterioration due to various reasons including aging, negligence, and high demand for water supply. Hence, to ensure a safe and reliable water supply, the water utilities need to perform routine pipe condition assessment. The condition assessment is usually carried out by visual inspection with the machine vision system carried by a robotic platform. The inspection platforms will capture the internal condition of the water pipelines in a video stream. However, the robotic platform frequently experiences difficulties while traversing through the valves installed along the pipeline. This inhibits and disrupts the inspection process of the water pipelines. Therefore, this article proposes a deep learning-based automatic valve detection framework to facilitate the robot’s navigation and ensure continuous inspection without any interruptions. The valve detection model is developed by combining MobileNet-160 and Feature Pyramid Network and is named as MFPN. The developed framework also employs a generative adversarial network to solve the sparse dataset issues and improve the generality of the framework. The comparative study and ablation analyses demonstrate that the proposed framework can achieve a higher mAP value of 89.11% in comparison with the state of the art. Hence, this light weight and efficient solution can be deployed to the robotic platform for real-time valve detection and enable autonomous navigation of the robotic platform for condition assessment of water pipelines.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9429956,IEEE/ASME Transactions on Mechatronics,2022
Safety Control for Quadrotor UAV Against Ground Effect and Blade Damage,"This article proposes a safety control scheme for quadrotor unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) to counteract ground effect and blade damage. The impacts of ground effect and blade damage are quantitatively analyzed in the established model. The proposed safety control scheme consists of position and attitude loops. Specifically, a proportional and derivative controller is designed as a baseline control with acceleration feedforward in the position loop. A disturbance observer (DO) using the measured Euler angles is exploited to estimate the lumped disturbance forces. The developed DO can effectively mitigate the estimation deviation caused by the angle tracking error. Subsequently, differential flatness theory is used to obtain the Euler angle references and the derivatives. In the attitude loop, sliding mode control and fixed-time sliding mode observer (SMO) are integrated to deal with ground effect and blade damage promptly. To demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed safety control scheme, flight experiments are carried out, where the quadrotor UAV flies close to the rugged ground in the presence of blade damage.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9677985,IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics,2022
Safety Flight Control for a Quadrotor UAV Using Differential Flatness and Dual-Loop Observers,"Focusing on a quadrotor unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV), the presence of unintended actuator faults and external disturbances increases the risk of a crash. Although plenty of efforts have been devoted, how to integrate capability analysis into safety control design is still an open issue. This article presents the design of a safety control system for quadrotor UAVs. Firstly, a system capability analysis method based on a differential flatness algorithm is developed, so that the derivatives (i.e., velocity, jerk, and snap) of flight trajectory can be formulated as flat variables. A tradeoff between system capability and permissible flight maneuverability is made to avoid actuator saturation. Secondly, dual-loop nonlinear disturbance observers are exploited to identify the actuator faults and disturbances, which can thereby be handled by a cascade control scheme. Moreover, the trajectory is regenerated online at the expense of degraded flight maneuverability or even emergency landing, in view of the remaining actuator control authority. When comparing to the existing methods, the gap among safety control, trajectory generation, and system capability analysis is bridged to ameliorate practical flight safety. Finally, flight tests are carried out to demonstrate the unique merits of the proposed system.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9658283,IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics,2022
Passive UAV Tracking in Wireless Networks,"Techniques for high accuracy tracking of the 3-D velocity, position, and cellular carrier frequency bias of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) that communicate using a cellular network are presented. The tracking algorithm does only rely on asynchronous measurements of Doppler shift in a minimum of four base station sites. This number can be reduced to three, by combination with a round-trip time measurement from one site. The tracking is therefore independent of any capability of the UAV transceiver, like the global positioning system that may be disabled in the UAV by the pilot. Another significant advantage is that high precision time synchronization between base stations is not needed. The algorithm exploits interacting multiple model filtering, with the nonlinear measurement equations handled by extended Kalman filters. The low computational complexity, low sampling rate, and the uplink Doppler shift measurement resources enable joint tracking of several UAVs per cell. This makes the tracking technique relevant for supervision of UAV traffic using cellular connectivity, for example for border surveillance and surveillance of sensitive areas like airports where illegal flying may be extremely dangerous and costly. Theoretically, an observability analysis treats measurement configurations based on different combinations of Doppler shift and round-trip time. Simulations are used to illustrate the performance and to assess the initialization properties.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9733239,IEEE Transactions on Aerospace and Electronic Systems,2022
Perceptual Enhancement for Autonomous Vehicles: Restoring Visually Degraded Images for Context Prediction via Adversarial Training,"Realizing autonomous vehicles is one of the ultimate dreams for humans. However, perceptual information collected by sensors in dynamic and complicated environments, in particular, vision information, may exhibit various types of degradation. This may lead to mispredictions of context followed by more severe consequences. Thus, it is necessary to improve degraded images before employing them for context prediction. To this end, we propose a generative adversarial network to restore images from common types of degradation. The proposed model features a novel architecture with an inverse and a reverse module to address additional attributes between image styles. With the supplementary information, the decoding for restoration can be more precise. In addition, we develop a loss function to stabilize the adversarial training with better training efficiency for the proposed model. Compared with several state-of-the-art methods, the proposed method can achieve better restoration performance with high efficiency. It is highly reliable for assisting in context prediction in autonomous vehicles.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9585517,IEEE Transactions on Intelligent Transportation Systems,2022
Prototyping and Evaluation of Infrastructure-Assisted Transition of Control for Cooperative Automated Vehicles,"Automated driving is now possible in diverse road and traffic conditions. However, there are still situations that automated vehicles cannot handle safely and efficiently. In this case, a Transition of Control (ToC) is necessary so that the driver takes control of the driving. Executing a ToC requires the driver to get full situation awareness of the driving environment. If the driver fails to get back the control in a limited time, a Minimum Risk Maneuver (MRM) is executed to bring the vehicle into a safe state (e.g., decelerating to full stop). The execution of ToCs requires some time and can cause traffic disruption and safety risks that increase if several vehicles execute ToCs/MRMs at similar times and in the same area. This study proposes to use novel C-ITS traffic management measures where the infrastructure exploits V2X communications to assist Connected and Automated Vehicles (CAVs) in the execution of ToCs. The infrastructure can suggest a spatial distribution of ToCs, and inform vehicles of the locations where they could execute a safe stop in case of MRM. This paper reports the first field operational tests that validate the feasibility and quantify the benefits of the proposed infrastructure-assisted ToC and MRM management. The paper also presents the CAV and roadside infrastructure prototypes implemented and used in the trials. The conducted field trials demonstrate that infrastructure-assisted traffic management solutions can reduce safety risks and traffic disruptions.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9369993,IEEE Transactions on Intelligent Transportation Systems,2022
Blockchain-Enabled Conditional Decentralized Vehicular Crowdsensing System,"The rapid growth of connected and autonomous vehicles (CAVs) shows an urgent demand for driving and transportation-related data, which gives rise to vehicular crowdsensing systems (VCSs). Nevertheless, the existing centralized VCS framework mainly faces the system reliability problem while the decentralized one cannot satisfy the management flexibility. In addition, when the privacy preservation scheme that prevents information leakage encounters the user selection scheme that desires detailed information of participants, how to balance this seemingly irreconcilable contradiction is inevitable for VCS. To remedy that, we take the first research attempt and explore the balance point between the system management, privacy preservation, and quality of experience (QoE) of participants. By fully exploiting the characters of participating entities, a blockchain-enabled conditional decentralized VCS is proposed in this paper. Firstly, we propose a privacy-preserving scheme where the zk-SNARK proof combines with the mixed-task smart contract to guarantee the interaction process will not reveal any private information of participants. Secondly, we propose an efficient reputation management mechanism that renders certain the participants can get a satisfactory QoE even under the condition that the private information of users is secured. And also, the malicious operations in the system will be effectively supervised. Theoretical analysis and extensive simulations demonstrate the security and efficiency properties of privacy preservation and indicate the effectiveness of reputation management.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9759228,IEEE Transactions on Intelligent Transportation Systems,2022
Age of Information Modeling and Optimization for Fast Information Dissemination in Vehicular Social Networks,"Autonomous vehicles (AVs) with advanced communication, computing, and control capabilities will provide not only a convenient means of transportation but also an emerging platform for real-time social communications and networking. Thereby, it is crucial to enable timely exchange of information over the dynamic cyber-physical-social system enabled by the AVs. In this paper, we consider age of information (AoI)-centric real-time information dissemination over vehicular social networks (VSNs), where the AoI captures the freshness of received data packets. We first propose a mathematical framework based on the mean-field theory (MFT) to analyze the network AoI (NAoI) of VSNs, namely AoI for the AV that lastly receives the information update in the network. The proposed analytical framework considers both the social features of vehicular networks, which are characterized using the scale-free network theory, and the underlying wireless communication process to evaluate the NAoI. Then, we further consider joint optimization of the information update rate at the source node and the transmit probabilities at the AVs for minimization of the average peak NAoI (PNAoI), i.e., the time average of peak values occurred in the evolution of the NAoI, which is solved via a novel parametric optimization scheme. Both analytical and simulation results show that compared with several baseline schemes, the proposed scheme can exploit the scale-free feature of the VSNs to significantly lower the average PNAoI by up to 96$\%$.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9730060,IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology,2022
Fast and Robust Registration of Partially Overlapping Point Clouds,"Real-time registration of partially overlapping point clouds has emerging applications in cooperative perception for autonomous vehicles and multi-agent SLAM. The relative translation between point clouds in these applications is higher than in traditional SLAM and odometry applications, which challenges the identification of correspondences and a successful registration. In this paper, we propose a novel registration method for partially overlapping point clouds where correspondences are learned using an efficient point-wise feature encoder, and refined using a graph-based attention network. This attention network exploits geometrical relationships between key points to improve the matching in point clouds with low overlap. At inference time, the relative pose transformation is obtained by robustly fitting the correspondences through sample consensus. The evaluation is performed on the KITTI dataset and a novel synthetic dataset including low-overlapping point clouds with displacements of up to 30 m. The proposed method achieves on-par performance with state-of-the-art methods on the KITTI dataset, and outperforms existing methods for low overlapping point clouds. Additionally, the proposed method achieves significantly faster inference times, as low as 410 ms, between 5 and 35 times faster than competing methods.

LBSV: Lightweight Blockchain Security Protocol for Secure Storage and Communication in SDN-Enabled IoV,"The development of modern software-defined networking (SDN) solutions brings new opportunities in Internet-of-Vehicles (IoVs). However, the autonomous nature of the vehicular environment leads to unpredictable security vulnerabilities and reliability issues. The high computation overhead and storage requirements also pose a significant challenge in message dissemination. To overcome these issues, we introduce a lightweight blockchain-based security protocol for secure communication and storage in SDN-enabled IoV, known as LBSV. The LBSV is a permissioned blockchain network that uses the proposed modified practical byzantine fault tolerance (mPBFT) consensus algorithm. Additionally, the SDN-enabled network exploits the blockchain framework and schedules different procedures. The secure message dissemination is achieved through various cryptographic functions (i.e., elliptic curve cryptography (ECC) and the secure hash algorithm (SHA256)). The security analysis shows that the LBSV withstands various cyberattacks regarding message dissemination privacy. The experimental results show that LBSV provides high performance with 85% less computational cost, 55% less storage and communication overhead and 90% less consensus delay compared with state-of-the-art schemes.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9749014,IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology,2022
Separate Control Strategy for a Biomimetic Gliding Robotic Fish,"In this article, we present a novel separate strategy to control the pitch attitude and the gliding direction for a biomimetic gliding robotic fish by the coordination of the external and internal control surfaces. First, we derive the gliding dynamics and hydrodynamics within the framework of the extended angle of attack (AOA), based on which the gliding model is decomposed into pitch and velocity terms. Next, the backstepping and model predictive controllers are designed to regulate pitch angle using a movable mass and an AOA using pectoral fins based on their control features, respectively. Further, extensive simulations encompassing separate control and path following with desired pitch attitude are conducted to verify the feasibility and superiority of the proposed control strategy. More importantly, to capture the real-time gliding states in practical environment, we develop a gliding measurement and control system. Through the system, the aquatic experiments are carried out to further verify the effectiveness of the proposed separate control strategy. The obtained results offer valuable insight into the development of complex motion control of the gliding robots, laying a solid foundation for diversified underwater missions besides visual perception and autonomous docking.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9580482,IEEE/ASME Transactions on Mechatronics,2022
Recurrent Models for Lane Change Prediction and Situation Assessment,"Predicting future events accurately is a task of great importance for autonomous vehicles. In this work we focus on lane change events. For this, we propose a novel attention mechanism on top of recurrent neural networks for the prediction task, which improves performance and yields more interpretable models. As critical corner cases are often not considered and reflected in traditional prediction metrics, we additionally introduce a new scenario-based evaluation scheme, which we posit be considered for further maneuver prediction works. Prediction and planning tasks often are correlated, usually sharing input representations and differing in expected outputs and their subsequent consideration. Here, we detail a supporting layer for planning tasks, which analyzes situations w.r.t. their suitability for lane changes and can serve as decision-making support for any planning algorithm. Exploitation of similarities between this task and the aforementioned prediction problem further improves performance of the prediction task, as well as labelling quality of the assessment task. Additionally, we extend our evaluation to urban scenarios, showcasing the generalizability of our proposed prediction models.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9760277,IEEE Transactions on Intelligent Transportation Systems,2022
Fast-HBNet: Hybrid Branch Network for Fast Lane Detection,"As one of the fundamental visual tasks in the unmanned driving area, lane detection attracts increasing attention. In practical applications, lane points are very difficult to localize because they usually appear to be sparse and incomplete due to the influence of illumination and environment. Conventional lane detection methods rely on coarse features and carefully designed postprocessing to detect the lane lines. However, these methods are usually slow, and the stability and generalization ability are unsatisfactory. In this paper, we propose a novel lane detection network – Fast-HBNet(Fast-Hybrid Branch Network), which exploits both global semantic information and spatial contexts. To enlarge receptive fields and encode more detailed information, the compound transformation is employed and the proposed hybrid branch network extracts four diverse feature maps with different receptive fields and spatial contexts. Besides, we design a Hierarchical Feature Learning (HFL) module to learn lane features from the scale, channel, and spatial levels to enhance the generalization ability of our detector. These features are further selectively coalesced to generate unified lane feature maps with large receptive fields and rich detailed information. In other words, our network can encode the global semantic information from the high-resolution feature maps and the fine-grained details in the low-resolution feature maps. Experimental results conducted on the TuSimple (2017) and CULane [Pan et al. (2018)] datasets demonstrate that the proposed Fast-HBNet outperforms numerous state-of-the-art lane detectors in both speed and accuracy. Particularly, Fast-HBNet achieves an accuracy of 96.88% on the TuSimple dataset at a speed of 76 FPS.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9700773,IEEE Transactions on Intelligent Transportation Systems,2022
Enhancing Feedback Steering Controllers for Autonomous Vehicles With Deep Monte Carlo Tree Search,"Steering control is a vital function for autonomous vehicles, whose performance largely determines the driving safety. The widely used feedback steering controllers degrade significantly when vehicles drive at high speeds. This is mainly because these controllers can not effectively exploit nonlinear vehicle dynamics and future road information. Hence, the steering actions generated by these controllers can not achieve accurate and stable path tracking performance. To overcome this limitation, we propose a deep learning based Monte Carlo Tree Search (DeepMCTS) method to enhance the feedback controllers. Due to the accuracy of the learning-based model in characterizing nonlinear vehicle dynamics and the lookahead search ability of MCTS, the control performance of the feedback controllers can be enhanced significantly. Different from MPC methods, which leverage vehicle dynamics and future road information via online optimization, our method relies on the efficient tree search process. Hence, our method can avoid heavy computational burden. Testing results validate the proposed method can achieve better tracking accuracy and stability in high speeds scenarios.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9839405,IEEE Robotics and Automation Letters,2022
A Reputation-Based Leader Election Scheme for Opportunistic Autonomous Vehicle Platoon,"As an emerging concept in the intelligent transportation system (ITS), Opportunistic Autonomous Vehicle Platoon (OAVP) enables autonomous vehicles to self-organize a temporary platoon and travel together. Whereas, electing the platoon leader is a crucial issue to be solved in this scenario. The platoon leader not only suffers from more wind resistance but also spends more computation resources in dealing with tremendous information obtained from the surrounding environment. Hence, vehicles tend to be a follower rather than a leader. In this paper, we propose a reputation-based leader election system for OAVP named RLE, which contains two sub-systems: leader election and incentive mechanism. In the former one, a reputation-based election scheme is first constructed to elect a relatively trustful leader according to the reputation value recorded on the blockchain. The proposed scheme integrates previous experience with recommendations from other members. In the second sub-system, an incentive mechanism is designed to stimulate platoon members to participate actively in the process of election, which is based on the recorded real-time fuel economy among vehicles participating in a platoon. Security analysis shows that the system is sufficient to deal with potential security threats. Experimental results based on the simulated platform demonstrate the practicality and feasibility of our solution.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9520239,IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology,2022
UAVs-Aided Delay-Tolerant Blockchain Secure Offline Transactions in Post-Disaster Vehicular Networks,"Vehicular networks which are paralyzed by natural disasters is faced with communication dilemma. Through building a decentralized communication network, unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) with high mobility and flexibility are expected to be the solution to the post-disaster vehicular networks. The blockchain technology has been widely used in UAV networks to provision the prompt security of distributed communications. However, existing works ignore the dynamics of the network in that due to high mobility, distributed UAVs cannot timely connect to the backbone to synchronize blockchain transactions. The delay of synchronization can result in severe security issues. On addressing the issues, this paper proposes UAVs-aided blockchain offline transactions to ensure the security and effectiveness of delay-tolerant blockchain transactions when UAVs are offline. In specific, we consider vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) charging transactions in post-disaster vehicular networks. By establishing offline channel between charging and discharging electric vehicles (EVs) by hashed time locked contract (HTLC), we design a UAVs aided penalty algorithm with accountable assertions to prevent deposit forging attacks and double-spending attacks. In addition, considering the selfishness of EVs, a Stackelberg game based incentive scheme is developed to encourage EVs to participate the offline transactions and to improve their trust values. By suing the mechanisms above, our proposal addresses the security of offline EV charging, as well as the selfishness of participant. Using extensive simulations, we demonstrate that the proposed scheme can realize secure transactions among EVs and can effectively improve the utilities of EVs through the comparison with conventional schemes.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9802738,IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology,2022
A Reinforcement Learning Approach for Enacting Cautious Behaviours in Autonomous Driving System: Safe Speed Choice in the Interaction With Distracted Pedestrians,"Driving requires the ability to handle unpredictable situations. Since it is not always possible to predict an impending danger, a good driver should preventively assess whether a situation has risks and adopt a safe behavior. Considering, in particular, the possibility of a pedestrian suddenly crossing the road, a prudent driver should limit the traveling speed. We present a work exploiting reinforcement learning to learn a function that specifies the safe speed limit for a given artificial driver agent. The safe speed function acts as a behavioral directive for the agent, thus extending its cognitive abilities. We consider scenarios where the vehicle interacts with a distracted pedestrian that might cross the road in hard-to-predict ways and propose a neural network mapping the pedestrian’s context onto the appropriate traveling speed so that the autonomous vehicle can successfully perform emergency braking maneuvers. We discuss the advantages of developing a specialized neural network extension on top of an already functioning autonomous driving system, removing the burden of learning to drive from scratch while focusing on learning safe behavior at a high-level. We demonstrate how the safe speed function can be learned in simulation and then transferred into a real vehicle. We include a statistical analysis of the network’s improvements compared to the original autonomous driving system.

Federated Vehicular Transformers and Their Federations: Privacy-Preserving Computing and Cooperation for Autonomous Driving,"Cooperative computing is promising to enhance the performance and safety of autonomous vehicles benefiting from the increase in the amount, diversity as well as scope of data resources. However, effective and privacy-preserving utilization of multi-modal and multi-source data remains an open challenge during the construction of cooperative mechanisms. Recently, Transformers have demonstrated their potential in the unified representation of multi-modal features, which provides a new perspective for effective representation and fusion of diverse inputs of intelligent vehicles. Federated learning proposes a distributed learning scheme and is hopeful to achieve privacy-secure sharing of data resources among different vehicles. Towards privacy-preserving computing and cooperation in autonomous driving, this paper reviews recent progress of Transformers, federated learning as well as cooperative perception, and proposes a hierarchical structure of Transformers for intelligent vehicles which is comprised of Vehicular Transformers, Federated Vehicular Transformers and the Federation of Vehicular Transformers to exploit their potential in privacy-preserving collaboration.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9857660,IEEE Transactions on Intelligent Vehicles,2022
A Secure and Lightweight Drones-Access Protocol for Smart City Surveillance,"The rising popularity of ICT and the Internet has enabled Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) to offer advantageous assistance to Vehicular Ad-hoc Network (VANET), realizing a relay node’s role among the disconnected segments in the road. In this scenario, the communication is done between Vehicles to UAVs (V2U), subsequently transforming into a UAV-assisted VANET. UAV-assisted VANET allows users to access real-time data, especially the monitoring data in smart cities using current mobile networks. Nevertheless, due to the open nature of communication infrastructure, the high mobility of vehicles along with the security and privacy constraints are the significant concerns of UAV-assisted VANET. In these scenarios, Deep Learning Algorithms (DLA) could play an effective role in the security, privacy, and routing issues of UAV-assisted VANET. Keeping this in mind, we have devised a DLA-based key-exchange protocol for UAV-assisted VANET. The proposed protocol extends the scalability and uses secure bitwise XOR operations, one-way hash functions, including user’s biometric verification when users and drones are mutually authenticated. The proposed protocol can resist many well-known security attacks and provides formal and informal security under the Random Oracle Model (ROM). The security comparison shows that the proposed protocol outperforms the security performance in terms of running time cost and communication cost and has effective security features compared to other related protocols.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9646496,IEEE Transactions on Intelligent Transportation Systems,2022
Automatic Jamming Signal Classification in Cognitive UAV Radios,"The integration of Cognitive Radio (CR) with Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) is an effective step towards relieving the spectrum scarcity and empowering the UAV with a high degree of intelligence. The dynamic nature of CR and the dominant line-of-sight links of UAVs poses serious security challenges and make the CR-UAV prone to a variety of attacks as malicious jamming. Joint jammer detection and automatic jammer classification is a powerful approach against the physical layer threats by identifying multiple jammers attacking the network that realize a crucial stage towards efficient interference management. This paper proposes a novel method for joint detection and automatic classification of multiple jammers attacking with different modulation schemes. The method is based on learning a representation of the radio environment encoded in a Generalized Dynamic Bayesian Network (GDBN) whilst multiple GDBN models represent various jamming signals under different modulation schemes. The CR-UAV performs multiple predictions online in parallel and evaluates multiple abnormality measurements based on a Modified Markov Jump Particle Filter (M-MJPF) to select the best-fit model that explains the detected jammer and recognize the modulation scheme accordingly. The simulated results demonstrate that the proposed GDBN-based method outperforms Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM), Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) and Stacked Autoencoder (SAE) in terms of classification accuracy and achieves a higher degree of explainability of its own decisions by interpreting causes and effects at hierarchical levels under the Bayesian learning and reasoning processes.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9858012,IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology,2022

The real-time and accurate recognition of road markings also serves significantly to the autonomous vehicles. This letter designs a self-attention (SA)-guided high-resolution capsule network to conduct road marking extraction from aerial images. First, by combining the superiorities of capsule formulation and high-resolution network architecture, this model behaves advantageously in providing fine-grained and strong feature semantics for promoting pixel-wise marking extraction accuracy. Furthermore, boosted by the capsule-based SA and adversarial learning mechanisms, the feature encoding quality and robustness are positively enhanced. Quantitative assessments, qualitative inspections, and comparative analyses on two aerial image datasets prove the excellent feasibility and effectiveness of the proposed model in road marking extraction tasks.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9597504,IEEE Geoscience and Remote Sensing Letters,2022

A multiple heterogeneous UAVs reconnaissance mission planning and re-planning algorithm,"Reconnaissance mission planning of multiple unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) under an adversarial environment is a discrete combinatorial optimization problem which is proved to be a non-deterministic polynomial (NP)-complete problem. The purpose of this study is to research intelligent multi-UAVs reconnaissance mission planning and online re-planning algorithm under various constraints in mission areas. For numerous targets scattered in the wide area, a reconnaissance mission planning and re-planning system is established, which includes five modules, including intelligence analysis, sub-mission area division, mission sequence planning, path smoothing, and online re-planning. The intelligence analysis module depicts the attribute of targets and the heterogeneous characteristic of UAVs and computes the number of sub-mission areas on consideration of voyage distance constraints. In the sub-mission area division module, an improved $K$-means clustering algorithm is designed to divide the reconnaissance mission area into several sub-mission areas, and each sub-mission is detected by the UAV loaded with various detective sensors. To control reconnaissance cost, the sampling and iteration algorithms are proposed in the mission sequence planning module, which are utilized to solve the optimal or approximately optimal reconnaissance sequence. In the path smoothing module, the Dubins curve is applied to smooth the flight path, which assure the availability of the planned path. Furthermore, an online re-planning algorithm is designed for the uncertain factor that the UAV is damaged.

Byzantine-Resilient Distributed Hypothesis Testing With Time-Varying Network Topology,"In this article, we study the problem of distributed hypothesis testing over a network of mobile agents with limited communication and sensing ranges to infer the true hypothesis collaboratively. In particular, we consider a scenario where there is an unknown subset of compromised agents that may deliberately share altered information to undermine the team objective. We propose two distributed algorithms where each agent maintains and updates two sets of beliefs (i.e., probability distributions over the hypotheses), namely local and actual beliefs (LB and AB, respectively, for brevity). In both algorithms, at every time step, each agent shares its AB with other agents within its communication range and makes a local observation to update its LB. Then, both algorithms can use the shared information to update ABs under certain conditions. One requires receiving a certain number of shared ABs at each time instant; the other accumulates shared ABs over time and updates after the number of shared ABs exceeds a prescribed threshold. Otherwise, both algorithms rely on the agent’s current LB and AB to update the new AB. We prove under mild assumptions that the AB for every noncompromised agent converges almost surely to the true hypothesis, without requiring connectivity in the underlying time-varying network topology. Using a simulation of a team of unmanned aerial vehicles aiming to classify adversarial agents among themselves, we illustrate and compare the proposed algorithms. Finally, we show experimentally that the second algorithm consistently outperforms the first algorithm in terms of the speed of convergence.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9508831,IEEE Transactions on Automatic Control,2022
Identification of Mangrove Invasive Plant Derris Trifoliate Using UAV Images and Deep Learning Algorithms,"Derris trifoliate, one of the most notorious invaders of mangroves in South China, seriously threatens the growth of mangroves and the stability of local ecosystem. In order to effectively control the spread of Derris trifoliate and stabilize the mangrove ecosystem, it is necessary to identify the distribution and simulate the occurrence of Derris trifoliate in mangrove forests. While previous methods for invasive plant mapping based on satellite images were limited by low temporal and spatial resolution, the newly born unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) images have provided a fast, fine-grained, and low-cost alternative for rapid invasive plant monitoring. However, extracting Derris trifoliate in mangrove forests based on UAV images is still a challenge. For one thing, it is difficult to collect enough data for model training, since the Derris trifoliate is hard to be distinguished in mangroves. For another thing, few existing methods can meet the requirements of high computing efficiency and low memory consumption of UAVs. Therefore, we proposed two lightweight deep learning networks based on DenseNet and VGG, namely, the lightweight DenseNet (LDN) and the lightweight VGG (LVG), and investigated the capability of LDN and LVG in identifying Derris trifoliate from mangrove forests with small amounts of data. This study has verified the effect of the lightweight deep learning algorithms for the accurate detection of mangrove invasive plants Derris trifoliate from UAV images.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9954894,IEEE Journal of Selected Topics in Applied Earth Observations and Remote Sensing,2022
Gaze Preserving CycleGANs for Eyeglass Removal and Persistent Gaze Estimation,"A driver’s gaze is critical for determining theirattention, state, situational awareness, and readiness to take over control from partially automated vehicles. Estimating the gaze direction is the most obvious way to gauge a driver’s state under ideal conditions when limited to using non-intrusive imaging sensors. Unfortunately, the vehicular environment introduces a variety of challenges that are usually unaccounted for - harsh illumination, nighttime conditions, and reflective eyeglasses. Relying on head pose alone under such conditions can prove to be unreliable and erroneous. In this study, we offer solutions to address these problems encountered in the real world. To solve issues with lighting, we demonstrate that using an infrared camera with suitable equalization and normalization suffices. To handle eyeglasses and their corresponding artifacts, we adopt image-to-image translation using generative adversarial networks to pre-process images prior to gaze estimation. Our proposed Gaze Preserving CycleGAN (GPCycleGAN) is trained to preserve the driver’s gaze while removing potential eyeglasses from face images. GPCycleGAN is based on the well-known CycleGAN approach - with the addition of a gaze classifier and a gaze consistency loss for additional supervision. Our approach exhibits improved performance, interpretability, robustness and superior qualitative results on challenging real-world datasets.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9684928,IEEE Transactions on Intelligent Vehicles,2022
"Detection and Isolation of Sensor Attacks for Autonomous Vehicles: Framework, Algorithms, and Validation","This paper investigates the cyber-security problem for autonomous vehicles under sensor attacks. In particular, a model-based framework is proposed which can detect sensor attacks and identify their sources in order to achieve the secure localization of self-driving vehicles. To ensure robustness of the vehicle against cyber-attacks, sensor redundancy is introduced, that is to deploy multiple sensors, each of which provides real-time pose observations of the vehicle. A bank of attack detectors is developed to capture anomalies in each sensor measurement, which is a combination of an extended Kalman filter (EKF) and a cumulative sum (CUSUM) discriminator. EKFs are employed to estimate the vehicle position and orientation recursively, while each CUSUM discriminator is designed to analyze the residual generated by its combined EKF to detect the possible deviation of the sensor measurement from the expected pose derived according to the mathematical model of the vehicle. To monitor the inconsistency amongst multiple sensor measurements, an auxiliary detector is introduced which fuses observations from multiple sensors. Based on the results of all the detectors, a rule-based isolation scheme is developed to identify the source anomalous sensor. The effectiveness of our proposed framework has been demonstrated on real vehicle data.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9430762,IEEE Transactions on Intelligent Transportation Systems,2022
CSG: Classifier-Aware Defense Strategy Based on Compressive Sensing and Generative Networks for Visual Recognition in Autonomous Vehicle Systems,"Visual classification algorithms based-on Deep Neural Networks (DNN) have been widely adopted in autonomous vehicle design. However, DNN suffers from adversarial attacks including pixel attacks and patch attacks, and its adoption may introduce new vulnerability into such security-critical scenarios. Existing defense techniques only focus on defending against one category, either pixel attacks or patch attacks, but does not translate to the other. Hence, the design of a practical comprehensive real-time defense algorithm for DNN-based classifiers presents a challenging task in this adversarial context. This paper attempts to address the abovementioned problem by combining Compressive Sensing with Generative neural networks (CSG) to construct an efficient defense framework, in conjunction with the proposal of a classifier-aware adversarial training way. Extensive experiments have been conducted using the LISA road sign dataset to evaluate the performance of CSG.

A Systematic Solution of Human Driving Behavior Modeling and Simulation for Automated Vehicle Studies,"Though automated vehicles (AVs) are believed to play a crucial role in future transport, human driving vehicles will share the road with automated vehicles for a relatively long period. So, we need to enable automated vehicles to run along with human drivers especially when they may have conflicts in the right of way. One key problem is how to appropriately model human driving behaviors and quickly simulate their actions when training/testing automated vehicles. Many existing models were originally built for traffic flow studies and may not be suitable for automated vehicles studies. In this paper, we propose a set of new principles of human driving behaviors modeling and simulations. Then, we propose a Data-Driven Simulator (D2Sim) model for human behavior learning, description, and vehicle interaction simulation. In contrast to conventional microscopic traffic flow models, the D2Sim is a trajectory generation model that accepts rich driving environment information (e.g., lane geometry, crosswalks, traffic signals, surrounding vehicles, etc.). Different from many empirical trajectory records replay models, we can arbitrarily set the long-term intentions of the simulated vehicles and intentionally design the corner cases that had not been observed in practice. In addition, the D2Sim adopts adversarial learning to comprehend complex yet stochastic human driving behaviors from empirical data. Testing results show that the proposed model can quickly generate high-resolution trajectory data for training and testing.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9767202,IEEE Transactions on Intelligent Transportation Systems,2022
Security Vulnerabilities and Protection Algorithms for Backpressure-Based Traffic Signal Control at an Isolated Intersection,"There is an increasing trend in the use of wireless communication along with new traffic signal control (TSC) algorithms to leverage and accommodate connected and autonomous vehicles. However, this development has increased the potential for cyber-attacks on TSC that can undermine the benefits of these new algorithms. An advanced persistent adversary can learn the behavior of TSC algorithms and launch attacks to preferentially get green time and/or to create traffic congestion in one intersection which can spread to the entire network. In this paper, we consider backpressure-based (BP-based) TSC algorithms and compare their performance under two misinformation attacks - 1) time spoofing attack in which vehicles alter their arrival times at the intersection and 2) ghost vehicle attack in which vehicles disconnect the wireless communication and thereby hide from the TSC. We show that these misinformation can influence the signal phases determined by BP-based TSC algorithms. We consider an adversary that determines a set of arriving vehicles to be attack vehicles from many candidate sets (attack strategies) in order to maximize the number of disrupted signal phases. We show that by formulating the problem as a 0/1 Knapsack problem, the adversary can explore the space of attack strategies and determine the optimal strategy that maximally compromises the performance in terms of average delay and fairness. We propose two protection algorithms, namely, auction-based (APA) and hybrid-based (HPA) algorithms and show that they are able to mitigate the impacts of the misinformation attacks.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9356466,IEEE Transactions on Intelligent Transportation Systems,2022
Reconfigurable Intelligent Surface Assisted Multi-Carrier Wireless Systems for Doubly Selective High-Mobility Ricean Channels,"Reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (RIS) constitute a revolutionary technique of beneficially reconfiguring the smart radio environment. However, despite the fact that wireless propagation is of time-varying nature, most of the existing RIS contributions focus on time-invariant scenarios for the following reasons. Firstly, it becomes impractical to instantaneously feed back the control signal based on the doubly selective non-line-of-sight (NLoS) fading scenario. Secondly, channel estimation conceived for the high-mobility and high-dimensional RIS-assisted links has to take into account the spatial-domain (SD), time-domain (TD), and frequency-domain (FD) correlations imposed by the angle-of-arrival/departure (AoA/AoD), the Doppler and the orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing (OFDM) operations, respectively, where none of the existing solutions can be directly applied. Thirdly, it is far from trivial to maximize the NLoS channel powers on all subcarriers by a common set of RIS reflecting coefficients. Fourthly, in the face of double selectivity, it becomes inevitable to encounter either inter-symbol interference (ISI) or inter-channel interference (ICI) during the signal detection in the TD or in the FD, respectively. Against this background, firstly, we focus our attention on line-of-sight (LoS) dominated unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) scenarios. Secondly, we conceive new minimum mean squared error (MMSE) channel estimation methods for doubly selective fading, which perodically transmit pilot symbols embedded into the TD and FD over the SD in order to beneficially exploit the correlations in the three domains. Thirdly, the RIS coefficients are optimized by a low-complexity algorithm based on the LoS representation of the end-to-end system model. Fourthly, tailor-made interference cancallation techniques are devised for improving the signal detection both in the FD and in the TD. Our simulation results are examined in six frequency bands licensed in 5 G, which confirms that the employment of RIS is capable of achieving substantial performance improvements.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9699402,IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology,2022
Joint Trajectory and Resource Optimization for UAV-Aided Two-Way Relay Networks,"Unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV)-aided two-way relay networks with multiple terrestrial user pairs is investigated, where a fix-wing UAV is served as a two-way relay to assist information transmission. We aim to maximize the total rate of the two-way relay networks while the quality of service (QoS) being guaranteed. A novel relay strategy, namely <i>time-slots pairing</i>, is proposed by exploiting physical-layer network coding (PNC) protocol. Specifically, the UAV receives and buffers the signals from the scheduled user pair when the UAV approaches one of them, then forwards the modulated signal when the UAV is close to the other. As a result, a non-convex total rate maximization problem is formulated by joint trajectory design and resource optimization. To solve this problem, we first decompose it into three sub-problems, and then a three-step iterative algorithm that can effectively handle the non-convex problem with no worse than a polynomial complexity is developed leveraging the block coordinate descent (BCD) technique and successive convex approximation (SCA) method. Simulation results finally illustrate that: 1) Compared with amplify-and-forward (AF) or decode-and-forward (DF) protocols, the proposed design based on PNC protocol can significantly improve the total rate of the two-way relay networks; 2) the time-slots pairing relay strategy always achieves a significant enhancement on performance than the traditional non-time-slots pairing relay strategy; 3) the time-slots pairing relay strategy is more favorable for the mobile PNC relay networks since it can well resist the degradation of the entire networks caused by users&#x2019; increased service quality requirements.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9627548,IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology,2022
Trajectory and Transmit Power Optimization for IRS-Assisted UAV Communication Under Malicious Jamming,"In this letter, we investigate an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) communication system, where an intelligent reflecting surface (IRS) is deployed to assist in the transmission from a ground node (GN) to the UAV in the presence of a jammer. We aim to maximize the average rate of the UAV commnunication by jointly optimizing the GN’s transmit power, the IRS’s passive beamforming and the UAV’s trajectory. However, the formulated problem is difficult to solve due to the non-convex objective function and the coupled optimization variables. Thus, to tackle it, we propose an alternating optimization (AO) based algorithm by exploiting the successive convex approximation (SCA) and semidefinite relaxation (SDR) techniques. Simulation results show that the proposed algorithm can significantly improve the average rate compared with the benchmark algorithms. Moreover, it also shows that when the jamming power is large and the number of IRS elements is relatively small, deploying the IRS near the jammer outperforms deploying it near the GN, and vice versa.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9810528,IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology,2022
Cluster-Based Characterization and Modeling for UAV Air-to-Ground Time-Varying Channels,"With the deep integration between the unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) and wireless communication, UAV-based air-to-ground (AG) propagation channels need more detailed descriptions and accurate models. In this paper, we aim to conduct cluster-based characterization and modeling for AG channels. To our best knowledge, this is the first study that concentrates on the clustering and tracking of multipath components (MPCs) for time-varying AG channels. Based on measurement data at 6.5 GHz with a bandwidth of 500 MHz, we first estimate potential MPCs utilizing the space-alternating generalized expectation-maximization (SAGE) algorithm. Then, we cluster the extracted MPCs by employing K-Power-Means (KPM) algorithm under multipath component distance (MCD) measure. For characterizing time-variant clusters, we exploit a clustering-based tracking (CBT) method, which efficiently quantifies the survival lengths of clusters. Ultimately, we establish a cluster-based channel model, and validations illustrate the accuracy of the proposed model. This work not only promotes a better understanding of AG propagation channels but also provides a general cluster-based AG channel model with certain extensibility.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9760200,IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology,2022
A Fast and Efficient Attitude Control Algorithm of a Tilt-Rotor Aerial Platform Using Inputs Redundancies,"Overactuated multirotor unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) usually consist of multiple tiltable thrust actuators. The controllers are mostly designed by regarding the thrust forces and actuator tilting angles as inputs of outer-loop position and attitude controllers, while formulating an inner-loop controller for each actuator to track the thrust and angle as required by the outer-loop. This hierarchical control strategy separates the complicated combined dynamics into two relatively simple systems, and thus simplifies the control design. However, the interaction between the two systems is neglected and therefore the control performance will be degraded when the inner-loop dynamics are not sufficiently fast. This letter investigates the capability of a new overactuated multirotor UAV configuration, where regular quadcopters are passively hinged onto the frame as tiltable thrust actuators. Apart from the thrust force and tilting angle, each actuator has additional auxiliary torque inputs, which exhibit fast responses as they are not subject to the inner-loop actuator tilting angle dynamics. In this letter, an add-on attitude compensation control is designed exploiting the auxiliary inputs to reduce the tracking and disturbance-rejection errors from the nominal control loop. The effectiveness is demonstrated in simulation and verified by experiment.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9664339,IEEE Robotics and Automation Letters,2022
Stereo Orientation Prior for UAV Robust and Accurate Visual Odometry,"This article presents a novel outlier rejection approach for feature-based visual odometry. The proposed approach is based on an empirical observation that shows that some 2D–3D correspondences with very low reprojection error can cause a high error in pose estimation. This work exploits such observations for odometry when a stereo camera is available. We argue that an explicit pose error measure is desired over that of implicit reprojection – whenever the former is possible – to classify correspondences into inliers versus outliers for the robust long-term odometry. To explicitly measure the plausible pose error, we derive bounds on the individual pose parameters with the help of the known orientation of stereo cameras. In this process, we formulate our bounds using the sum-of-square polynomials, which allow us to test whether a given correspondence satisfies any solution within the expected bounds. If the correspondence does not satisfy bounds for any parameter, it is considered to be an outlier. We implemented and tested the proposed method for the unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) indoor navigation. The experiments from both benchmark evaluations (EuRoC and KITTI) and UAV onboard tests indicate that the inlier group refined by the proposed method significantly improves odometry estimation compared to the traditional outlier rejection methods. In fact, the proposed method performs as accurately as inertial measurement unit (IMU) aided methods in the state of the art.

Joint Optimization of Trajectory and Resource Allocation for Time-Constrained UAV-Enabled Cognitive Radio Networks,"Unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV)-enabled communication has emerged as an irreplaceable technology in military, disaster relief and emergency scenarios. This correspondence investigates the average throughput in a UAV-enabled cognitive radio network, where the UAV is regarded as a dedicated secondary user to enhance the network coverage and spectral efficiency. Based on the probabilistic line-of-sight channel, we exploit the joint design of UAV trajectory and resource allocation to maximize the average throughput under the constraints of co-channel interference and completion time. The original problem is a mixed integer non-convex problem which is generally NP-hard. We first decompose the primal problem into a bilevel programming problem, and then propose an efficient high-quality algorithm based on the particle swarm optimization approach. The optimized trajectory reveals the trade-off between throughput and co-channel interference. Numerical results verify the superiority of the proposed algorithm as compared to other benchmark schemes.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9714863,IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology,2022
Aerial-Terrestrial Network NOMA for Cellular-Connected UAVs,"Efficient connectivity in cellular-connected unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV)s is limited by scarcity of the radio spectrum and strong inter-cell interference (ICI). To address these issues, we propose an aerial-terrestrial network non-orthogonal multiple access (ATN-NOMA) scheme. In this proposed scheme, we pair the aerial user (AU) and terrestrial user (TU) in a NOMA setting to leverage their asymmetric channel gains and rate demands in downlink communications. In ATN-NOMA, the strong ICI issue at the AU receiver is further managed by an elevation-angle based user association, equipping the AU with an adjustable beamwidth directional antenna, and forming a beamforming among the coordinated terrestrial base stations (BS)s. We then obtain the optimal beamwidth and suboptimal power allocation so that the TUs’ sum-rate is maximized subject to the AU’s Quality-of-Service (QoS) requirement. The corresponding optimization problem is non-convex in which we exploit the structure of the problem and apply successive convex approximation (SCA) to obtain a suboptimal solution. We then derive the statistical properties, which consequently enable us to estimate the aggregated ICI. In cases where no interfering BSs have the same elevation angle as the coordinated BSs, we further approximate the AU’s outage probability. We then compare the TUs’ sum-rate and the outage probability of the ATN-NOMA with multiple existing schemes. Extensive simulation results show that our proposed ATN-NOMA scheme outperforms existing schemes by 52-91% in terms of the sum-rate, and its analytical outage probability can be as low as the order of $10^{-17}$. Furthermore, we show that the pairing of AU and TU in multi-cell networks remains beneficial, subject to effective mitigation of ICI.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9750898,IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology,2022
Prioritized Delay Optimization for NOMA-Based Multi-UAV Emergency Networks,"In emergency networks, it is significant to jointly consider users’ priorities and communication delays for post-disaster users. To this end, we propose an essential metric by integrating these two factors, namely prioritized delay. Moreover, we formulate a min-max prioritized delay problem for non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA)-based multi-unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) emergency networks, where the powers of all users are concurrently optimized to balance prioritized delay among users while suppressing multi-user interference introduced by NOMA and multiple UAVs. The problem is found to be non-convex, and we propose the substitution-decomposition-scaling-block successive upper bound minimization (SDS-BSUM) algorithm to address this issue. Specifically, the originally-formulated problem is first transformed into a standard form through variable substitution, followed by problem decomposition into single-UAV subproblems through exploiting its separable structure, and the scaling of non-convex constraints into tight convex ones. Finally, the converted problem is fitted into BSUM for solving. Simulation results reveal that compared with the existing schemes, the proposed SDS-BSUM not only reduces the prioritized delay by up to 70$\%$, but also achieves an excellent delay fairness commensurate with users’ priorities.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9802742,IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology,2022
On the Performance of UAV Relaying With Reconfigurable Antenna and Media Based Modulation in the Presence of Shadowed Fading,"Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) have attracted significant interest from the academia and industry most recently. Motivated by the wide usage of UAVs, this letter considers UAV communication with reconfigurable antenna (RA) in the presence of fading and shadowing effects, which occur due to tall buildings and skyscrapers in urban areas. More precisely, RA offers to receive information through mirror activation patterns (MAPs) so that it can achieve a receive diversity with decreased error probability by using only one radio frequency chain. Also, media-based modulation (MBM) technique with MAPs can be exploited by using RAs with reduced cost. To quantify the performance of the proposed UAV system, we derive a tight upper bound for the overall error probability by considering approximated channel model based on the standardization studies. The results have shown that RAs can make the overall system more resilient to shadowing and fading effects in terms of error performance, and they are energy efficient.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9796150,IEEE Transactions on Aerospace and Electronic Systems,2022
Renewable Energy Re-Distribution via Multiscale IoT for 6G-Oriented Green Highway Management,"While recent works on investigating renewable energy sources for powering the highway offer promising solutions for sustainable environments, they are often impeded by unequal distribution of sources across the region due to variations in solar exposure and road intensity that electromagnetically and mechanically generate the energy. By exploiting viable gathering of massive renewable energy data using the Internet of Things (IoT), this paper proposes a framework for improved highway-energy management based on the unmanned aerial vehicle-assisted wireless energy re-distribution of the harvested renewable energy. Combining both massive low-rate sensing with high-speed 6G-envisioned transmission for data aggregation, the IoT architecture is of multi-scale, consisting of: i) global data exchange and analytics for energy mapping, re-distribution planning and forecasting, and ii) local data sensing and processing at individual highway lampposts for micro-energy management. The feasibility of the networked energy system is analyzed via analytical cost-reliability analyses. The cost analysis demonstrates the cost-effectiveness through the lowest Requirement of Energy and Cost of Energy for the setup and maintenance. The reliability analysis reveals the energy plus (E+) feature of the system in certain conditions with enhanced reliability in adverse weathers that impact energy generation. With multi-scale data connectivity to intelligently manage standalone renewable energy, this work puts forward a viable idea of 6G use cases with massively networked energy sensors with a vision of achieving super-connected and intelligence-equipped highways.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9894364,IEEE Transactions on Intelligent Transportation Systems,2022
Kinematic Orienteering Problem With Time-Optimal Trajectories for Multirotor UAVs,"In many unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) applications for surveillance and data collection, it is not possible to reach all requested locations due to the given maximum flight time. Hence, the requested locations must be prioritized and the problem of selecting the most important locations is modeled as an Orienteering Problem (OP). To fully exploit the kinematic properties of the UAV in such scenarios, we combine the OP with the generation of time-optimal trajectories with bounds on velocity and acceleration. We define the resulting problem as the Kinematic Orienteering Problem (KOP) and propose an exact mixed-integer formulation together with a Large Neighborhood Search (LNS) as a heuristic solution method. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach based on orienteering instances from the literature and benchmark against optimal solutions of the Dubins Orienteering Problem (DOP) as the state-of-the-art. Additionally, we show by simulation that the resulting solutions can be tracked precisely by a modern MPC-based flight controller. Since we demonstrate that the state-of-the-art in generating time-optimal trajectories in multiple dimensions is not generally correct, we further present an improved analytical method for time-optimal trajectory generation.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9844257,IEEE Robotics and Automation Letters,2022
Train in Dense and Test in Sparse: A Method for Sparse Object Detection in Aerial Images,"Applications of aerial imaging, especially based on unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) platform, rapidly explode in recent years. Meanwhile, vision-based sensing, e.g., detection and recognition, for UAVs becomes increasingly important. Objects in aerial images are usually of tiny size, hence occupying a limited area. Terminology speaking, the images are very sparse in spatial. However, existing work in aerial object detection commonly ignores this point. Conversely, we explore the availability of such a property in improving the detection performance of aerial images. Specifically, we propose a general method, train in dense and test in sparse (TDTS), to exploit sparsity in aerial object detection: 1) in the training stage, the possible positions of object are learned by training a fully convolutional network (called prophet head) and 2) in the testing stage, prophet head identifies the possible object locations to reduce redundant computation in classification and box prediction head by sparse convolution. By extensive experiments on the VisDrone2019-Det data set, we find that the sparsity can not only help to speed up inference but also to improve accuracy. Thus, we argue that the sparsity deserves more attention.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9257003,IEEE Geoscience and Remote Sensing Letters,2022
Multispectral Semantic Land Cover Segmentation From Aerial Imagery With Deep Encoder–Decoder Network,"Developing accurate algorithms for agricultural pattern recognition from aerial imagery has become increasingly important due to the prevalence of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs). This letter introduces a deep encoder–decoder network for semantic land cover segmentation, where the goal is to classify six anomaly categories from multispectral aerial imagery. Since aerial imagery exhibits specific characteristics and visual challenges in this imaging domain, existing semantic segmentation models are not plug-and-play. Starting from a state-of-the-art segmentation model, we present a step-by-step analysis of key challenges and also reveal our observations in addressing these challenges. In particular, we investigate on how to exploit data prior knowledge, how to deal with sample imbalance, and how to encode global semantic and contextual information to improve segmentation. Experiments on a recent large-scale aerial land cover data set demonstrate that our method achieves compelling performance against other state-of-the-art approaches. Our results and insights can provide references for practitioners working in this field when dealing with similar segmentation problems.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9269368,IEEE Geoscience and Remote Sensing Letters,2022
Covert Communication With Energy Replenishment Constraints in UAV Networks,"In this paper, we investigate the possibility and condition of exploiting wireless-powered signals as a cover for conducting covert communications in unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) networks. Specifically, we aim to design the hovering altitude of a UAV and its prior transmission probability to strike a balance between energy replenishment and covert communications. We derive the necessary condition for guaranteeing communication covertness subject to an energy replenishment constraint, under which the UAV’s optimal hovering and the prior transmission probability are determined. Our simulation shows that varying the prior transmission probability can significantly improve the achievable communication covertness under the energy replenishment constraint, relative to a baseline scheme with a fixed prior transmission probability.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9783114,IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology,2022
Second-Order-Optimal Filter on Lie Groups for Planar Rigid Bodies,"Attitude estimation is a core problem in many mobile robotic systems, such as unmanned aerial and ground vehicles.

In this article, we propose a second-order-optimal minimum-energy filter on the matrix Lie group TSE(2), the tangent bundle of the special Euclidean group SE(2), where the optimality is with respect to a cost function in the unknown input and output error measurements. In this article, the measurement equation consists of a global positioning system-like device with two antennas attached to the planar rigid body and an inertial measurement unit-like device. Even though the mathematics is quite complicated, the accuracy of the filter justifies this approach.

A Novel Direct Trajectory Planning Approach Based on Generative Adversarial Networks and Rapidly-Exploring Random Tree,"Trajectory planning is essential for self-driving vehicles and has stringent requirements for accuracy and efficiency. The existing trajectory planning methods have limitations in the feasibility of planned trajectories and computational efficiency. This paper proposes a life-long learning framework to achieve effective and high-accuracy direct trajectory planning (DTP) tasks. Based on generative adversarial networks (GANs), this study develops a lightweight GDTP model to map the initial/final states and the control action sequence. Additionally, by embedding the GDTP into the rapidly-exploring random tree (RRT), a GDTP-RRT algorithm is further designed for long-distance and multi-stage planning tasks. Taking the tractor-trailer as an application case, we test the proposed method in multiple scenarios with varying characteristics. The experimental results show that the method can plan highly feasible trajectories in a short time, compared with the most applied algorithm – the cubic curve RRT* (CCRRT*). It is found that the tracking errors of our method are 29.1% and 44.1% lower than the CCRRT* in terms of position and heading angle.

Secure Distributed Adaptive Platooning Control of Automated Vehicles Over Vehicular Ad-Hoc Networks Under Denial-of-Service Attacks,"This article deals with the problem of secure distributed adaptive platooning control of automated vehicles over vehicular ad-hoc networks (VANETs) in the presence of intermittent denial-of-service (DoS) attacks. The platoon, which is wirelessly connected via directed vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) communication, is composed of a group of following vehicles subject to unknown heterogeneous nonlinearities and external disturbance inputs, and a leading vehicle subject to unknown nonlinearity and external disturbance as well as an unknown control input. Under such a platoon setting, this article aims to accomplish secure distributed platoon formation tracking with the desired longitudinal spacing and the same velocities and accelerations guided by the leader regardless of the simultaneous presence of nonlinearities, uncertainties, and DoS attacks. First, a new logical data packet processor is developed on each vehicle to identify the intermittent DoS attacks via verifying the time-stamps of the received data packets. Then, a scalable distributed neural-network-based adaptive control design approach is proposed to achieve secure platooning control. It is proved that under the established design procedure, the vehicle state estimation errors and platoon tracking errors can be regulated to reside in small neighborhoods around zero. Finally, comparative simulation studies are provided to substantiate the effectiveness and merits of the proposed control design approach on maintaining the desired platooning performance and attack tolerance.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9440748,IEEE Transactions on Cybernetics,2022
Path Planning and Following Control of Autonomous Bus Under Time-Varying Parameters Against Parametric Uncertainties and External Disturbances,"Path planning and path following are key technologies for autonomous vehicles. Strong nonlinearity, coupling characteristics, parametric uncertainties, external disturbances, and complicated driving scenarios put forward great challenges in estimation, control, and optimization of autonomous vehicles. Multi-dimension information utilization offers an effective solution to cope with the foregoing challenges. The presented research proposes a path planning and tracking framework for optimal design and regulation of control variables for collision avoidance and active guidance system, aiming to improve tracking performance and system robustness. For path planning approach, a virtual harmful potential field in 3 dimension (3D) is built to provide a collision-free trajectory as a reference path for path following, depending on vehicle kinematic model and boundary conditions of roads. A linear parameter-varying, polytopic vehicle lateral model is developed to address the issues of time-variable longitudinal speeds and preview distance on vehicle lateral stability management. Further, a strong robust gain-scheduling path following control approach based on linear matrix inequality methodology is proposed to tackle problems relating to characteristics of temporal variations, parametric uncertainties and external disturbances. Comparisons study under the TruckMaker/Xpack4-RapidECU joint HIL platform demonstrate that both tracking precision and high robustness to parametric uncertainties and external disturbances are superior than model predictive control method. The presented path following method provides an important insight into exploiting the robust control method's favorable merits while guaranteeing its computing efficiency.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9763348,IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology,2022
On Detecting Drunk Drivers in Mixed Autonomous Platoons Using Vehicles Velocity Measurements,"Drunk drivers, who critically and continuously threaten road safety, are usually detected using biological sensors within the same vehicle or after drunk driving behavior is observed by police patrols. Observing an obvious drunk driving behavior indicates a relatively high blood alcohol concentration, and thus, detecting drunk drivers with a relatively low blood alcohol concentration is difficult. This study uses output-only measurements available from motion sensors in the longitudinal drive of mixed autonomous and human-driven platoons to detect drunk drivers’ behavior in human-driven vehicles within the same platoon. The human-driven vehicle is assumed to be between two autonomous vehicles that are able to share information with each other. The proposed approach relates a set of motion sensor measurements with another within the platoon and does not require the knowledge of the excitation signal or the dynamics of the platoon. Numerical simulations are first implemented to test the proposed approach, and then, VISSIM software is implemented to simulate realistic road topography. Further validations on laboratory mobile robots are presented in this article, where a class of abnormal driving conditions that includes human-driven vehicles is simulated. Experiments are carried out by measuring abnormal human-driven vehicles within connected autonomous robots. This method is shown to deal with various system uncertainties, and the approach can deal with the drunk driver case. The drunken driving conditions are modeled mathematically with different blood alcohol concentration levels, which correspond to different effects and different drunk driving behaviors. The proposed transmissibility-based drunk driver detection algorithm is shown to detect drivers with risky relatively low alcohol concentrations.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9850392,IEEE/ASME Transactions on Mechatronics,2022
Secure Content Delivery for Connected and Autonomous Trucks: A Coalition Formation Game Approach,"With the ever-increasing demand for the content delivery services in autonomous vehicular networks (AVNs), caching popular contents in the edge nodes in advance is expected to reduce the transmission delay. Current works on the contents cached in connected and autonomous vehicles (CAVs) or roadside units (RSUs) are facing the problems of limited caching size and high deployment cost. In this paper, by exploiting the advantages of high caching space and flexibility of truck platoons composed of connected and autonomous trucks (CATs), we propose a secure content delivery service for CATs based on coalition formation game. Firstly, in order to protect the security and privacy of content delivery services, a differential privacy model is proposed to protect the sensitive information of CATs. Meanwhile, the differential privacy model is combined with the incentive based trust evaluation model to monitor the behaviors of CATs. In the incentive based models, CATs are encouraged to improve their trust values to obtain higher utilities and find a balance between confidence levels and utilities. Moreover, a coalition formation game is established among CATs with the same driving route, in which all CATs can maximize their utilities with the formation of several minor coalitions. Finally, we conduct extensive simulations to demonstrate the effectiveness and superiority of the proposed scheme.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9899365,IEEE Transactions on Intelligent Transportation Systems,2022
A Push-Based Probabilistic Method for Source Location Privacy Protection in Underwater Acoustic Sensor Networks,"As the research topics in ocean emerge, underwater acoustic sensor networks (UASNs) have become ever more relevant. Consequently, challenges arise with the security and privacy of the UASNs. Compared to the active attacks, the characteristics of passive attacks are more difficult to discriminate. Thus, the focus of this study is on the passive attacks in UASNs, where a push-based probabilistic method for source location privacy protection (PP-SLPP) is proposed. The fake packet technology and the multipath technology are utilized in the PP-SLPP scheme to counter the passive attacks, so as to protect the source location privacy in UASNs. Moreover, the Ekman drift current model is employed to simulate the underwater environment. And the mean shift algorithm and the k-means algorithm are adopted in the dynamic layer and static layer of the Ekman drift current model, respectively, to increase the stability of the clusters. Finally, an autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV) swarm is implemented to collect data in clusters. Through the comparison with existing data collection schemes in UASNs, the simulation results have demonstrated that the PP-SLPP scheme can achieve a longer safety period, with a minor compromise of energy consumption and delay.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9446512,IEEE Internet of Things Journal,2022
UAV-Assisted Physical Layer Security in Multi-Beam Satellite-Enabled Vehicle Communications,"In this paper, we investigate unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) assisted physical layer security in multi-beam satellite enabled vehicle communications. Particularly, the UAV is exploited as a relay to improve the secure satellite-to-vehicle link, and simultaneously serves as a jammer by deliberately generating artificial noise (AN) to confuse Eve. The satellite beamforming (BF) and UAV power allocation (PA) are jointly optimized to maximize the secrecy rate of the legitimate user within a target beam while guaranteeing the quality of service (QoS) of users within other beams. Since the problem is nonconvex, we first convert it into an equivalent two-stage problem. Then, the outer-stage problem is solved by using one-dimensional search, and the inner-stage problem is transformed to a bi-convex problem by using the semi-definite relaxation (SDR) and Charnes Cooper transformation. To solve the inner-stage bi-convex problem, we propose an iterative alternating optimization algorithm, where the optimal BF is obtained by semi-definite programming (SDP), and the optimal UAV PA is subsequently obtained by solving the reformulated fractional programming problem with an iterative Dinkelbach method. The tightness of SDR and the complexity of our proposed approach are analyzed, and extensive simulations are carried out to evaluate the effectiveness of our proposed approach.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9463880,IEEE Transactions on Intelligent Transportation Systems,2022
Robust Coordinated Hybrid Source Seeking With Obstacle Avoidance in Multivehicle Autonomous Systems,"In multivehicle autonomous systems that operate under unknown or adversarial environments, it is a challenging task to simultaneously achieve source seeking and obstacle avoidance. Indeed, even for single-vehicle systems, smooth time-invariant feedback controllers based on navigation or barrier functions have been shown to be highly susceptible to arbitrarily small jamming signals that can induce instability in the closed-loop system, or that are able to stabilize spurious equilibria in the operational space. When the location of the source is further unknown, adaptive smooth source seeking dynamics based on averaging theory may suffer from similar limitations. In this article, we address this problem by introducing a class of novel distributed hybrid model-free controllers, that achieve robust source seeking and obstacle avoidance in multivehicle autonomous systems, with vehicles characterized by nonlinear continuous-time dynamics stabilizable by hybrid feedback. The hybrid source seeking law switches between a family of cooperative gradient-free controllers, derived from potential fields that satisfy mild invexity assumptions. The stability and robustness properties of the closed-loop system are analyzed using Lyapunov tools and singular perturbation theory for set-valued hybrid dynamical systems. The theoretical results are validated via numerical and experimental tests.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9345457,IEEE Transactions on Automatic Control,2022
Detection of Nonrandom Sign-Based Behavior for Resilient Coordination of Robotic Swarms,"Cooperative multirobot systems coordinate their motion by exchanging information through consensus schemes to achieve a common goal. In the event of stealthy cyber attacks, compromised measurements and communication broadcasts can hijack a portion or the entire system toward undesired states. However, in order for these attacks to be effective, they have to exhibit nonrandom characteristics that contradict the expected multirobot system behavior. To deal with these hidden attacks, we propose a runtime monitoring framework that considers the signed residual, defined as the difference between the expected and the received information to identify and isolate unexpected nonrandom behavior within the multirobot system. Specifically, the technique that we propose—named Cumulative Sign detector—monitors and compares changes in signed values of residual with their expected occurrences to detect inconsistencies and trigger alarms when an attack is discovered. Our results are validated theoretically by providing detection bounds and are demonstrated with simulations and experiments on swarms of unmanned ground vehicles under different attacks in comparison with state-of-the-art residual-based detection schemes.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9686360,IEEE Transactions on Robotics,2022
Smart Card-Based Identity Management Protocols for V2V and V2I Communications in CCAM: A Systematic Literature Review,"Besides developing new Cooperative, Connected and Automated Mobility (CCAM) services for the improvement of road safety and travel experience, researchers are considering protection mechanisms to ensure the security of these services and the safety of involved users (drivers but also, e.g., cyclists and pedestrians). In particular, several Identity Management (IDM) protocols have been designed as the first line of defence against external attackers. Among these protocols, a promising trend in research consists in the use of a Smart Card (SC) as a technical enabler for strong authentication. Indeed, many SC-based IDM protocols for Vehicle-to-Vehicle (V2V) and Vehicle-to-Infrastructure (V2I) communications in real-time CCAM services have been proposed in the literature which present interesting features and promising usability experimental results. However, this research line is far from being exhausted, especially considering the recent spread of SC technologies and use cases. For this reason, in this paper we propose a systematic literature review on SC-based IDM protocols for real-time CCAM services. In particular, we identify characterising assumptions of CCAM scenarios and extrapolate a unified high-level view of the steps composing a SC-based IDM protocol. Then, we present a detailed survey of several SC-based IDM protocols. Finally, we identify trends in research and formulate guidelines and useful recommendations to provide a solid base which researchers can use as a starting point for the design of new and improved SC-based IDM protocols for CCAM scenarios.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9576545,IEEE Transactions on Intelligent Transportation Systems,2022
Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV)-Assisted Path Planning for Unmanned Ground Vehicles (UGVs) via Disciplined Convex-Concave Programming,"Thelast decade has witnessed growing research interests in the path-planning problem for unmanned ground vehicles (UGVs) equipped with RGB-D cameras or LiDARs. However, apart from their extremely high cost, these sensors may be obscured by obstacles, which makes them impractical for many complex scenarios. Besides, most of the existing works for path planning have not considered energy efficiency for UGVs that are usually constrained by limited on-board batteries. Distinct from existing methods, this work presents a vision-based unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV)-assisted cooperative system for multiple UGVs. The proposed system harnesses the broad vision of UAV and operates in both general outdoor and global positioning system (GPS)-denied indoor environments. In sharp contrast to the conventional heuristic algorithms such as the rapidly exploring random tree (RRT) algorithm and the Dijkstra methods, the proposed energy-efficient path planning for UGVs is formulated as a non-convex optimization problem by considering the collision-aware obstacle-avoidance. More specifically, the proposed path-planning scheme contains two stages, namely the semantic segmentation that localizes UGVs and obstacles in the environment by exploiting the wide-angle camera mounted on the UAV, followed by the trajectory generation in which a disciplined convex and concave programming (DCCP) algorithm is devised for the non-convex energy-minimization problem. Extensive experiments validate the effectiveness of the UAV-UGV cooperative system and the proposed DCCP-based path-planning scheme.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9760118,IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology,2022
"Continuous and Precise Positioning in Urban Environments by Tightly Coupled Integration of GNSS, INS and Vision","Accurate, continuous and seamless state estimation is the fundamental module for intelligent navigation applications, such as self-driving cars and autonomous robots. However, it is often difficult for a standalone sensor to fulfill the demanding requirements of precise navigation in complex scenarios. To fill this gap, this letter proposes to exploit the complementariness of the global navigation satellite system (GNSS), inertial measurement unit (IMU) and vision via a tightly coupled integration method, aiming to achieve continuous and accurate navigation in urban environments. Specifically, the raw GNSS carrier phase and pseudorange measurements, IMU data, and visual features are directly fused at the observation level through a centralized Extended Kalman Filter (EKF) to make full use of the multi-sensor information and reject potential outlier measurements. Furthermore, the widely used high-precision GNSS models including precise point positioning (PPP) and real-time kinematic (RTK) are unified in the proposed integrated system to increase usability and flexibility. We validate the performance of the proposed method on several challenging datasets collected in urban canyons and compare against the loosely coupled and state-of-the-art methods.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9866851,IEEE Robotics and Automation Letters,2022
RFAP: A Revocable Fine-Grained Access Control Mechanism for Autonomous Vehicle Platoon,"Autonomous Vehicle Platoon (AVP) is conceived as a promising solution to enhance the traffic capacity and reduce the energy consumption in the intelligent transportation system. Nevertheless, AVP without security guarantees are prone to various attacks, which probably lead to life-threatening accidents. Motivated by solving this issue, an outsourced attribute-based access control mechanism with direct revocation for AVP (RFAP) is introduced in this paper. Among them, attribute-based encryption is utilized to implement fine-grained access control during the encryption process. Furthermore, RFAP can not only realize the immediate revocation of platoon member who is about to leave the platoon without affecting others, but also achieve secure outsourced decryption with the help of edge computing units for minimizing the computational overhead of decryption on the vehicle side. Security analysis and simulation results indicate that our RFAP mechanism is practical in aspects of security and efficiency.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9523580,IEEE Transactions on Intelligent Transportation Systems,2022
Resilient Branching MPC for Multi-Vehicle Traffic Scenarios Using Adversarial Disturbance Sequences,"An approach to resilient planning and control of autonomous vehicles in multi-vehicle traffic scenarios is proposed. The proposed method is based on model predictive control (MPC), where alternative predictions of the surrounding traffic are determined automatically such that they are intentionally adversarial to the ego vehicle. This provides robustness against the inherent uncertainty in traffic predictions. To reduce conservatism, an assumption that other agents are of no ill intent is formalized. Simulation results from highway driving scenarios show that the proposed method in real-time negotiates traffic situations out of scope for a nominal MPC approach and performs favorably to state-of-the-art reinforcement-learning approaches without requiring prior training. The results also show that the proposed method performs effectively, with the ability to prune disturbance sequences with a lower risk for the ego vehicle.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9760144,IEEE Transactions on Intelligent Vehicles,2022
An Inverse Reinforcement Learning Approach for Customizing Automated Lane Change Systems,"Vehicle automation seeks to enhance road safety and improve the driving experience. However, a standard system does not account for variations in users and driving conditions. Customizing vehicle automation based on users’ preferences aims to improve the user experience and adoption of the technologies. This study introduces a systematic paradigm that starts with naturalistic driving data to identify the driving behaviors and styles for a customized automated lane change system. The driving behaviors are first extracted using Multivariate Functional Principal Component Analysis (MFPCA) with minimum prior expert knowledge. The driving styles are identified by clustering the extracted driving behaviors. An Inverse Reinforcement Learning (IRL) algorithm is then used to train the automated lane change system from grouped demonstrations of the identified driving styles to capture the preferences of a group of drivers with a similar driving style. The performance of the proposed customized automated lane change system is compared to (1) a non-customized system trained on all the sample trips, (2) customized systems built on expert-coded reward functions, and (3) customized systems trained using a Generative Adversarial Imitation Learning (GAIL) algorithm. The results show that our method outperforms all the other systems with respect to the prediction accuracy of the lane change actions. Additionally, our method gains insights on the representative behaviors of different driving styles to enable customization of automated lane change systems.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9785911,IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology,2022
AUV-Aided Data Importance Based Scheme for Protecting Location Privacy in Smart Ocean,"Data collection in underwater acoustic sensor networks (UASNs) and the exposure of node location information pose a threat to the security of the entire network. Therefore, the main challenge for underwater acoustic sensor network security is to protect the security and privacy of the node locations. Compared to active attacks, the characteristics of passive attacks are indistinguishable. Therefore, this research focuses on passive attacks in underwater acoustic sensor networks, and an autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV)-aided data-importance-based scheme for protecting location privacy (DIS-PLP) is proposed. The DIS-PLP comprises three main parts. First, the anchor node calculates the importance of the current data based on the historical dataset and decides whether to send data packets to the base station according to the importance result. Subsequently, an AUV privacy violation is defined, and an AUV path planning method is proposed to prevent attackers from tracking the AUV to obtain the location of the source node. Finally, to prevent nodes from waiting too long for AUVs, a secure multi-hop transmission method is proposed that uses fake source nodes to send fake source data packets to hide the real traffic. The simulation results show that the DIS-PLP offers well performance in terms of safety time and delay, which has strong practical significance for Smart Ocean to improve the level of network security.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9783136,IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology,2022
An Active Perception Framework for Autonomous Underwater Vehicle Navigation Under Sensor Constraints,"Inertial navigation for autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs) is challenging because of the drift error caused by the noise and measurement errors of inertial sensors, typically packaged as an inertial measurement unit (IMU), integrated over time. To mitigate the drift error, recent AUV state estimation approaches incorporate external references or environmental information obtained from exteroceptive sensors, with increased costs and limited operational domains. For improved navigation under sensor constraints, this article proposes an active perception framework that exploits vehicle motion to estimate the flow state together with the vehicle state using IMU and depth sensors only. The proposed framework uses the estimated flow state as external information to improve vehicle state estimation. We construct a linear time-varying system for the flow state, separated from a nonlinear system for the vehicle state. This formulation allows us to analyze uniform complete observability for the flow state, which is found to depend on vehicle motion. Then, along with vehicle and flow state estimators, we design a vehicle controller to enable vehicle motion to maximize an information metric pertaining to estimation performance based on either observability or constructability Gramian for the flow state. The proposed framework is validated through simulations for a case study with a vehicle descending through the water column in a time-varying flow field. The effectiveness of the framework is demonstrated by comparing results obtained from its four implementations with those from baseline approaches without active perception.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9679478,IEEE Transactions on Control Systems Technology,2022
Evolutionary Game Based Strategy Selection for Hybrid V2V Communications,"Vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) communications is an important technology in vehicular ad hoc network (VANET) to support autonomous data exchange among vehicles. Multiple V2V communications modes have been investigated for VANET, including dedicated short-range communications (DSRC) based on IEEE 802.11p and LTE-V2X, which are suitable for different packet transmission cases. In order to fully exploit the strengths of various modes, hybrid V2V communications strategies are designed in this paper, where each vehicle is allowed to choose different modes for different kinds of transmissions in separate frequency bands for transmission throughput improvement. Furthermore, since it is usually impractical to decide all the vehicles’ communications strategies globally due to high computational complexity and heavy overhead to broadcast the decisions, we model the selection of hybrid V2V communications strategies for vehicles as an evolutionary game. A strategy selection algorithm is then proposed, where each vehicle can select its hybrid V2V communications strategy locally based on its evaluation of the payoffs for different strategies and limited signalling from the base station. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed algorithm can converge to an asymptotic stable state, which can improve the transmission throughput of vehicles, and is robust to the slight evaluation errors of payoffs and the strategy mutations of a few vehicles.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9633173,IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology,2022
Vehicle Detection From UAV Imagery With Deep Learning: A Review,"Vehicle detection from unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) imagery is one of the most important tasks in a large number of computer vision-based applications. This crucial task needed to be done with high accuracy and speed. However, it is a very challenging task due to many characteristics related to the aerial images and the used hardware, such as different vehicle sizes, orientations, types, density, limited datasets, and inference speed. In recent years, many classical and deep-learning-based methods have been proposed in the literature to address these problems. Handed engineering- and shallow learning-based techniques suffer from poor accuracy and generalization to other complex cases. Deep-learning-based vehicle detection algorithms achieved better results due to their powerful learning ability. In this article, we provide a review on vehicle detection from UAV imagery using deep learning techniques. We start by presenting the different types of deep learning architectures, such as convolutional neural networks, recurrent neural networks, autoencoders, generative adversarial networks, and their contribution to improve the vehicle detection task. Then, we focus on investigating the different vehicle detection methods, datasets, and the encountered challenges all along with the suggested solutions. Finally, we summarize and compare the techniques used to improve vehicle detection from UAV-based images, which could be a useful aid to researchers and developers to select the most adequate method for their needs.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9439930,IEEE Transactions on Neural Networks and Learning Systems,2022
Adversarial Swarm Defence Using Multiple Fixed-Wing Unmanned Aerial Vehicles,"This article proposes a coverage-based adversarial swarm defence algorithm. The defender swarm composed of fixed-wing unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) is assumed to have explosives onboard to intercept an adversarial swarm. The proposed approach consists of the following two steps: first, impact point optimization and, second, model predictive control (MPC)-based impact time control. The impact point optimization periodically optimizes impact points for the corresponding UAVs to maximize the coverage within the hostile swarm while minimizing the common impact time. The optimization domain is limited to a physically reachable area of UAVs with the common impact time. Besides, the MPC-based impact time controller is designed to ensure the multiple UAVs to arrive the generated time-varying impact points simultaneously. Numerical simulations are performed to prove the feasibility and efficiency of the proposed swarm defence algorithm.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9761772,IEEE Transactions on Aerospace and Electronic Systems,2022
A Privacy-Preserving-Based Secure Framework Using Blockchain-Enabled Deep-Learning in Cooperative Intelligent Transport System,"Cooperative Intelligent Transport System (C-ITS) is a promising technology that aims to improve the traditional transport management systems. In C-ITS infrastructure Autonomous Vehicles (AVs) communicate wirelessly with other AVs, Road Side Units (RSUs) and Traffic Command Centres (TCCs) using an open channel Internet. However, the use of the Internet brings inherent vulnerabilities related to privacy (e.g., adversary performing inference and data poisoning attacks), and security (e.g., AVs can be compromised using advanced hacking techniques) issues and prevents the faster realization of C-ITS applications. To address these challenges, this paper presents a privacy-preserving-based secure framework to provide both privacy and security in C-ITS infrastructure. The proposed framework provides two level of security and privacy using blockchain and deep learning modules. First, a blockchain module is designed to securely transmit the C-ITS data between AVs–RSUs-TCCs, and a smart contract-based enhanced Proof of Work (ePoW) technique is designed to verify data integrity and mitigate data poisoning attacks. Second, a deep-learning module is designed that includes Long-Short Term Memory-AutoEncoder (LSTM-AE) technique for encoding C-ITS data into a new format to prevent inference attacks. The encoded data is used by the proposed Attention-based Recurrent Neural Network (A-RNN), for intrusive events recognition in C-ITS infrastructure. The proposed A-RNN is trained using Truncated Backpropagation Through Time (BPTT) algorithm. The framework is further validated and tested using two publicly available ToN-IoT and CICIDS-2017 datasets. The proposed framework is compared with peer privacy-preserving intrusion detection techniques, and the result shows the effectiveness of the proposed framework over several state-of-the-art techniques in both blockchain and non-blockchain systems.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9505613,IEEE Transactions on Intelligent Transportation Systems,2022
Event-Triggered Adaptive Formation Keeping and Interception Scheme for Autonomous Surface Vehicles Under Malicious Attacks,"In leader-following formation, the leader plays a central role and is more vulnerable to malicious attacks. To effectively protect the leader, this article investigates an event-based formation control problem of autonomous surface vehicles (ASVs) with multiple attackers and actuator failure. A novel adaptive formation keeping and interception scheme is developed for ASVs. In this scheme, a formation keeping controller and an interception controller are designed under a unified framework by sharing same event-triggered mechanism and fault-tolerant structure. To bridge these two controllers, a degree and distance driven formation interception ($\text{D}^3$FI) strategy is designed by generating defenders. It is shown that with the proposed scheme, all attackers are intercepted without affecting formation keeping of remaining ASVs if the original topology is connected. Advantages of our scheme are: 1) stable controller switching is ensured during the formation cooperation and 2) the fault-tolerance is obtained with lower actuator updating frequencies and least number of adaptive parameters for each ASV.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9534686,IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics,2022
Drone Detection Using Sparse Lidar Measurements,"Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV) have been serving people, fulfilling various roles in research, industry and military, not to exclude personal entertainment. They have also been in use more often for malicious purposes, such as annoying neighbors, disrupting air-travel, attacking people or infrastructure. Therefore, motivated particularly by malicious uses, the research community has been interested in proposing solutions for detection of UAVs. In this work, we present a ground based aerial target detection system using lidars, relying on sparse detections rather than dense point clouds, with the aim of not only detecting but also estimating their motion and active tracking. We lay a theoretical groundwork to analyse the performance of such a lidar based detection system and help understanding its limitations. The work is complemented with field experiments utilizing a state-of-the-art lidar and several drones of different sizes, showing effectiveness in both detection and tracking using sparse measurements.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9691910,IEEE Robotics and Automation Letters,2022
Learning Interaction-Aware Guidance for Trajectory Optimization in Dense Traffic Scenarios,"Autonomous navigation in dense traffic scenarios remains challenging for autonomous vehicles (AVs) because the intentions of other drivers are not directly observable and AVs have to deal with a wide range of driving behaviors. To maneuver through dense traffic, AVs must be able to reason how their actions affect others (interaction model) and exploit this reasoning to navigate through dense traffic safely. This paper presents a novel framework for interaction-aware motion planning in dense traffic scenarios. We explore the connection between human driving behavior and their velocity changes when interacting. Hence, we propose to learn, via deep Reinforcement Learning (RL), an interaction-aware policy providing global guidance about the cooperativeness of other vehicles to an optimization-based planner ensuring safety and kinematic feasibility through constraint satisfaction. The learned policy can reason and guide the local optimization-based planner with interactive behavior to pro-actively merge in dense traffic while remaining safe in case other vehicles do not yield. We present qualitative and quantitative results in highly interactive simulation environments (highway merging and unprotected left turns) against two baseline approaches, a learning-based and an optimization-based method. The presented results show that our method significantly reduces the number of collisions and increases the success rate with respect to both learning-based and optimization-based baselines.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9750012,IEEE Transactions on Intelligent Transportation Systems,2022
Accelerating Monte Carlo Bayesian Prediction via Approximating Predictive Uncertainty Over the Simplex,"Estimating the predictive uncertainty of a Bayesian learning model is critical in various decision-making problems, e.g., reinforcement learning, detecting the adversarial attack, self-driving car. As the model posterior is almost always intractable, most efforts were made on finding an accurate approximation to the true posterior. Even though a decent estimation of the model posterior is obtained, another approximation is required to compute the predictive distribution over the desired output. A common accurate solution is to use Monte Carlo (MC) integration. However, it needs to maintain a large number of samples, and evaluate the model repeatedly, and average multiple model outputs. In many real-world cases, this is computationally prohibitive. In this work, assuming that the exact posterior or a decent approximation is obtained, we propose a generic framework to approximate the output probability distribution induced by the model posterior with a parameterized model and in an amortized fashion. The aim is to approximate the predictive uncertainty of a specific Bayesian model, meanwhile alleviating the heavy workload of MC integration at testing time. The proposed method is universally applicable to Bayesian classification models that allow for posterior sampling. Theoretically, we show that the idea of amortization incurs no additional costs on approximation performance. Empirical results validate the strong practical performance of our approach.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9305977,IEEE Transactions on Neural Networks and Learning Systems,2022
Autonomous Maneuver Decisions via Transfer Learning Pigeon-Inspired Optimization for UCAVs in Dogfight Engagements,"This paper proposes an autonomous maneuver decision method using transfer learning pigeon-inspired optimization (TLPIO) for unmanned combat aerial vehicles (UCAVs) in dogfight engagements. Firstly, a nonlinear F-16 aircraft model and automatic control system are constructed by a MATLAB/Simulink platform. Secondly, a 3-degrees-of-freedom (3-DOF) aircraft model is used as a maneuvering command generator, and the expanded elemental maneuver library is designed, so that the aircraft state reachable set can be obtained. Then, the game matrix is composed with the air combat situation evaluation function calculated according to the angle and range threats. Finally, a key point is that the objective function to be optimized is designed using the game mixed strategy, and the optimal mixed strategy is obtained by TLPIO. Significantly, the proposed TLPIO does not initialize the population randomly, but adopts the transfer learning method based on Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence to initialize the population, which improves the search accuracy of the optimization algorithm. Besides, the convergence and time complexity of TLPIO are discussed. Comparison analysis with other classical optimization algorithms highlights the advantage of TLPIO. In the simulation of air combat, three initial scenarios are set, namely, opposite, offensive and defensive conditions. The effectiveness performance of the proposed autonomous maneuver decision method is verified by simulation results.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9864998,IEEE/CAA Journal of Automatica Sinica,2022
A Shared Representation for Photorealistic Driving Simulators,"A powerful simulator highly decreases the need for real-world tests when training and evaluating autonomous vehicles. Data-driven simulators flourished with the recent advancement of conditional Generative Adversarial Networks (cGANs), providing high-fidelity images. The main challenge is synthesizing photorealistic images while following given constraints. In this work, we propose to improve the quality of generated images by rethinking the discriminator architecture. The focus is on the class of problems where images are generated given semantic inputs, such as scene segmentation maps or human body poses. We build on successful cGAN models to propose a new semantically-aware discriminator that better guides the generator. We aim to learn a shared latent representation that encodes enough information to jointly do semantic segmentation, content reconstruction, along with a coarse-to-fine grained adversarial reasoning. The achieved improvements are generic and simple enough to be applied to any architecture of conditional image synthesis. We demonstrate the strength of our method on the scene, building, and human synthesis tasks across three different datasets.

Automatic Detection and Counting System for Pavement Cracks Based on PCGAN and YOLO-MF,"The regular detection of pavement cracks is critical for life and property security. However, existing deep learning-based methods of crack detection face difficulties in terms of data acquisition and defect counting. An automatic intelligent detection and tracking system for pavement cracks is proposed. Our system is formed of a pavement crack generative adversarial network (PCGAN) and a crack detection and tracking network called YOLO-MF. First, PCGAN is used to generate realistic crack images, to address the problem of the small number of available images. Next, YOLO-MF is developed based on an improved YOLO v3 modified by an acceleration algorithm and median flow (MF) algorithm to count the number of cracks. In a counting loop, our improved YOLO v3 detects cracks and the MF algorithm tracks the cracks detected in a video. This improved algorithm achieves the best accuracy of 98.47% and F1 score of 0.958 among other algorithms, and the precision-recall curve was close to the top right. A tiny model was developed and an acceleration algorithm was applied, which improved the detection speed by factors of five and six, respectively. In on-site measurement, three cracks were detected and tracked, and the total count was correct. Finally, the system was embedded in an intelligent device consisting of a calculating module, an automated unmanned aerial vehicle, and other components.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9745793,IEEE Transactions on Intelligent Transportation Systems,2022
Tightly-Coupled Fusion of VINS and Motion Constraint for Autonomous Vehicle,"In this paper, we develop a novel visual-inertial navigation system with motion constraint (VINS-Motion), which extends the visual-inertial navigation system (VINS) to incorporate vehicle motion information for improving the autonomous vehicles localization accuracy. We introduce the vehicle stop detection module in the pre-processing measurement procedure. During the back-end processing, if the vehicle is detected to be in a stopping state, we perform optimization based on the stop constraint to help eliminate the abnormal jitter of the estimated pose, thus ensuring the reasonability of the trajectory. Otherwise, besides the prior information, IMU measurement residual, and visual measurement residual utilized in VINS, vehicle orientation/velocity constraint built by Ackerman steering model is first exploited to constitute residuals. We minimize the sum of priors and Mahalanobis norms of three kinds of residuals to obtain a maximum posterior estimation, thus increasing system consistency and accuracy. The proposed approach is validated on public datasets and compared with state-of-the-art algorithms, which demonstrates that the motion constraint proposed in this paper improves the standard VINS performance and achieves significantly higher positioning accuracy.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9741341,IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology,2022
A Secure Dynamic Mix Zone Pseudonym Changing Scheme Based on Traffic Context Prediction,"Traffic context plays an important role in supporting automated driving and intelligent transportation systems. Smart vehicles explore surrounding environments by analyzing sensor data and periodically communicating with neighbors and road infrastructures. The context can be well learned in this way to support driving, but the vehicle trajectory can be also easily exposed under eavesdropping attacks. The pseudonym is proposed to hide the real identity of the vehicles. However, the effectiveness of anonymity, the safety of driving, the convenience of implementation and the utilization of resources in previous approaches have not been well-balanced. Therefore, focusing on efficiently replacing pseudonyms with the premise of ensuring driving safety, we propose a secure dynamic silent mix zone pseudonym changing scheme (TLAS) based on the real-time traffic context prediction for urban regions. It naturally takes the area in front of the red traffic light as a silent mix zone, which avoids the driving security issue caused by signal silence. Besides, the area length is dynamically configured according to the traffic context predicted in the last green light cycle, so the anonymous effect can be improved. In addition, considering the resource utilization and accuracy requirement, the adaptive prediction algorithm is applied. We conduct simulation experiments with real-world traffic history using SUMO and OMNET++, the results show that TLAS strategy can indeed achieve a better anonymous effect (reducing standardized traceability rate by 8.2%) with lower driving speed for safety concern.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9613820,IEEE Transactions on Intelligent Transportation Systems,2022
Efficient Federated Learning With Spike Neural Networks for Traffic Sign Recognition,"With the gradual popularization of self-driving, it is becoming increasingly important for vehicles to smartly make the right driving decisions and autonomously obey traffic rules by correctly recognizing traffic signs. However, for machine learning-based traffic sign recognition on the Internet of Vehicles (IoV), a large amount of traffic sign data from distributed vehicles is needed to be gathered in a centralized server for model training, which brings serious privacy leakage risk because of traffic sign data containing lots of location privacy information. To address this issue, we first exploit privacy-preserving federated learning to perform collaborative training for accurate recognition models without sharing raw traffic sign data. Nevertheless, due to the limited computing and energy resources of most devices, it is hard for vehicles to continuously undertake complex artificial intelligence tasks. Therefore, we introduce powerful Spike Neural Networks (SNNs) into traffic sign recognition for energy-efficient and fast model training, which is the next generation of neural networks and is practical and well-fitted to IoV scenarios. Furthermore, we design a novel encoding scheme for SNNs based on neuron receptive fields to extract information from the pixel and spatial dimensions of traffic signs to achieve high-accuracy training. Numerical results indicate that the proposed federated SNN outperforms traditional federated convolutional neural networks in terms of accuracy, noise immunity, and energy efficiency as well.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9784851,IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology,2022
Coordinated Cognitive Risk Control for Bridging Vehicular Radar and Communication Systems,"As an essential part of the emerging Internet of Things, connected and autonomous vehicles (CAVs) have the potential to reshape future transportation systems and change the commute style in people’s everyday life. Among many vehicular on-board devices, radar system and vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) communication system are two important pillars for the realization of CAVs. In this paper, the concept of coordinated CRC (C-CRC) is proposed to serve as a cognitive mediator for bridging vehicular radar and communication systems. By establishing a mutual-assistance relationship, C-CRC provides a new safety mechanism that allows one system to learn from and react to the risks that the other system has encountered. Simulation results have shown that the proposed method has desirable performance in face of motion perturbation and/or jamming attack under various scenarios.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9292428,IEEE Transactions on Intelligent Transportation Systems,2022
Multi-PPTP: Multiple Probabilistic Pedestrian Trajectory Prediction in the Complex Junction Scene,"Pedestrian trajectory prediction in dynamic, multi-agent traffic junction scene is an important problem in the context of self-driving cars. Accurately predicting the trajectory of the agent, especially the pedestrian with high randomness, is of great significance to autonomous driving technology. In this paper, we propose Multi-PPTP, a novel trajectory prediction model that first utilizes a composite rasterized map to model the complex representations and interactions of road components, including dynamic obstacles (e.g., pedestrians, vehicles, and cyclists) and static road information (e.g., lanes, traffic lights, and sidewalks). Then it uses MapNet and AgentNet to extract spatio-temporal features by deep convolutional networks and LSTM to automatically derive relevant features, and next exploits Interaction-AttNet aggregate features to learn the high interactions among all components by affine transformation and multi-head attention mechanism. Additionally, we also propose a series of unique loss functions to predict multiple possible trajectories of each pedestrian while estimating their probabilities. Following extensive offline evaluation and comparison to the state-of-the-art models, our approach outperforms significantly the state-of-the-art models on our large scale in-house and public nuScenes dataset.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9619864,IEEE Transactions on Intelligent Transportation Systems,2022
Guaranteed Collision-Free Reference Tracking in Constrained Multi Unmanned Vehicle Systems,"In this article, we face the reference tracking control problem for a system of heterogeneous multiple unmanned vehicles (MUVs) moving in a 2-D planar environment. We consider a scenario, where each vehicle follows a trajectory imposed by a local planner and where each unmanned vehicle can have different linear dynamics as well as different constraints and disturbances. In this contest, we design a novel control architecture, where a centralized traffic manager, in conjunction with ad-hoc designed local vehicle controllers, is capable of ensuring the absence of collisions. The proposed solution is obtained by exploiting, for the local vehicles’ controllers, a dual-mode model-predictive controller and, for the traffic manager, set-theoretic and controllability properties. Moreover, after modeling the potential vehicle collisions with a graph, connectivity arguments are used to obtain an optimal collision resolution, which minimizes the number of vehicles that need to be stopped. The resulting control scheme ensures collision-free signal tracking. Results of the simulation conducted on an MUV system are shown to provide tangible evidence of the features of the proposed framework.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9468311,IEEE Transactions on Automatic Control,2022
Attacks on Formation Control for Multiagent Systems,"Multiagent systems (MASs) are distributed systems with two or more intelligent agents. Formation control is a significant control technique of MASs. To date, formation control on MASs is widely used in various fields, such as robots, spacecrafts, satellites, and unmanned aerial/surface/underwater vehicles. However, there is a relatively small body of literature that is concerned with security problems of formation control on MASs in past years. Our research represents the first step toward developing security attacks of formation control on MASs. Our study aims to investigate potential security problems of formation control on a multirobot system for the first time. We propose two kinds of control-level attacks and each kind of attack includes several specific attack forms. Then, we discuss specific features of formation control on a classical multirobot system and utilize theoretical analyses to illustrate how cyberattacks can influence the physical movements of robots. The experimental results of the proposed attacks show that attacks can easily interrupt formation movements of a multirobot system and several carefully designed attacks even can cause irreversible loss.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9484672,IEEE Transactions on Cybernetics,2022
An Enhanced Multi-Stage Deep Learning Framework for Detecting Malicious Activities From Autonomous Vehicles,"Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS), particularly Autonomous Vehicles (AVs), are susceptible to safety and security concerns that impend people’s lives. Nothing like manually controlled vehicles, the safekeeping of communications and computing constituents of AVs can be threatened using sophisticated hacking techniques, consequently disrupting AVs from the operative usage in our daily life routines. Once manually controlled vehicles are linked to the Internet, so-called the Internet of Vehicles (IoVs), they would be misused by cyberattacks. In this paper, we present a multi-stage intrusion detection framework to identify intrusions from ITSs and produce low rate of false alarms. The proposed framework can automatically distinguish intrusions in real-time. The proposed framework is based on normal state-based and a deep learning-centered bidirectional Long Short Term Memory (LSTM) architecture to efficiently discover intrusions from the fundamental network gateways and communication networks of AVs. The designed framework is evaluated through two benchmark datasources, that is, the UNSWNB-15 datasource for exterior network communications and the car hacking datasource for in-vehicle communications. The outcomes indicated that the proposed framework achieves high performance that outperforms various current state-of-the-art systems with an accuracy rate of 98.88% for the UNSWNB-15 dataset and 99.11% for the car hacking dataset. Besides, the proposed framework is furthermore capable to detect zero-day (concealed) outbreaks from IoVs networks.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9519840,IEEE Transactions on Intelligent Transportation Systems,2022
Analysis of ID Sequences Similarity Using DTW in Intrusion Detection for CAN Bus,"Connected vehicles have recently attracted considerable attention for revolutionizing the transportation industry. Although connectivity brings about a vast number of benefits, it can give rise to a wider attack surface as more physical access interfaces have been introduced. In particular, anomalous behaviour of the Electronic Control Units (ECUs) caused by malicious attacks can result in serious consequences and possibly lead to fatal accidents. Hence, it is important to develop methodologies that can sniff vehicular data and detect it for further attack analysis. In this article, we develop a novel similarity-based intrusion detection methodology named SIDuDTW, which identifies malicious messages inside vehicle network, e.g., Controller Area Network (CAN), by using Dynamic Time Warping (DTW) distance between CAN ID sequences. Subsequently, the theoretical analysis for the recurring sequence pattern, wave splitting strategies, similarity metric, and optimal parameters providing strong robustness against several kinds of attacks in SIDuDTW are detailed. A series of experiments demonstrate that the developed methodology can detect attacks with high accuracy. In addition, this proposed methodology significantly outperforms the intrusion detection capabilities of existing approaches in terms of basic injection, replay and suppression attacks. It is envisioned that this work will contribute to the development of safer autonomous vehicle conceptualized as a key unit within broader smart city.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9808189,IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology,2022
A Survey of Attacks on Controller Area Networks and Corresponding Countermeasures,"The development of vehicle technologies such as connected and autonomous vehicle environments provide drivers with functions for convenience and safety that are highly capable of remote vehicle diagnosis or lane-keeping assistance. Unfortunately, despite impressive advantages for drivers, these functions also have various vulnerabilities that could lead to cyber-physical attacks on automotive Controller Area Networks (i.e., automotive CAN). To deal with these security issues, a multitude of issue-specific countermeasures have already been proposed. In this paper, we introduce existing research on automotive CAN attacks and evaluate several state-of-the-art countermeasures. Particularly, we provide a comprehensive adversary model for automotive CAN and classify existing countermeasures into four system categories: (1) preventative protection, (2) intrusion detection, (3) authentication, and (4) post-protection. From the extensive literature review, we attempt to summarize the security research regarding automotive CAN and identify open research directions for in-vehicle networks of autonomous vehicle.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9439954,IEEE Transactions on Intelligent Transportation Systems,2022
OpenStreetMap-Based Autonomous Navigation With LiDAR Naive-Valley-Path Obstacle Avoidance,"OpenStreetMaps (OSM) is currently studied as the environment representation for autonomous navigation. It provides advantages such as global consistency, a heavy-less map construction process, and a wide variety of road information publicly available. However, the location of this information is usually not very accurate locally. In this paper, we present a complete autonomous navigation pipeline using OSM information as environment representation for global planning. To avoid the flaw of local low-accuracy, we offer the novel LiDAR-based Naive-Valley-Path (NVP) method that exploits the concept of “valley” areas to infer the local path always furthest from obstacles. This behavior allows navigation always through the center of trafficable areas following the road’s shape independently of OSM error. Furthermore, NVP is a naive method that is highly sample-time-efficient. This time efficiency also enables obstacle avoidance, even for dynamic objects. We demonstrate the system’s robustness in our research platform BLUE, driving autonomously across the University of Alicante Scientific Park for more than 20 km with 0.24 meters of average error against the road’s center with a 19.8 ms of average sample time. Our vehicle avoids static obstacles in the road and even dynamic ones, such as vehicles and pedestrians.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9906811,IEEE Transactions on Intelligent Transportation Systems,2022
Uncovering Interpretable Internal States of Merging Tasks at Highway on-Ramps for Autonomous Driving Decision-Making,"Humans make daily routine decisions based on their internal states in intricate interaction scenarios. This article presents a probabilistically reconstructive learning approach to identify the internal states of multivehicle sequential interactions when merging at highway on-ramps. We treated the merging task’s sequential decision as a dynamic, stochastic process and then integrated the internal states into a hidden Markov model (HMM)-Gaussian mixture regression (GMR) model, a probabilistic combination of an extended GMR and HMM. We also developed a variant of the expectation–maximization (EM) algorithm to estimate the model parameters and verified it based on a real-world dataset. Experiment results reveal that three interpretable internal states can semantically describe the interactive merge procedure at highway on-ramps. This finding provides a basis for developing an efficient model-based decision-making algorithm for autonomous vehicles (AVs) in a partially observable environment. Note to Practitioners—Model-based learning approaches have obtained increasing attention in decision-making design due to their stability and interpretability. This article was built upon two facts: 1) intelligent agents can only receive partially observable environmental information directly through their equipped sensors in the real world and 2) humans mainly utilize the internal states and associated dynamics inferred from observations to make proper decisions in complex environments. Similarly, autonomous vehicles (AVs) need to understand, infer, anticipate, and exploit the internal states of dynamic environments. Applying probabilistic decision-making models to AVs requires updating the internal states’ beliefs and associated dynamics after getting new observations. The designed and verified emission model in hidden Markov model (HMM)-Gaussian mixture regression (GMR) provides a modifiable functional module for online updates of the associated internal states. Experiment results based on the real-world driving dataset demonstrate that the internal states extracted using HMM-GMR can represent the dynamic decision-making process semantically and make an accurate prediction.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9512609,IEEE Transactions on Automation Science and Engineering,2022
Game Theoretic Physical Layer Authentication for Spoofing Detection in UAV Communications,"In this paper, we propose a game theoretic framework for secure physical layer authentication (PLA) by applying the spatial correlations of received signal strength (RSS) in the air-to-ground channels between an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV), a legitimate transmitter, and a spoofer. Based on our hypothesis model, we first derive the false alarm rate and miss detection rate for the UAV receiver. We then formulate a zero-sum PLA game where the UAV receiver selects its RSS detection threshold while the spoofer selects its attack probability to maximize their respective utilities. We derive the Nash equilibrium (NE) and its existence condition for the proposed PLA game. Monte Carlo simulation results accurately verify our analytical expressions for the false alarm rate and miss detection rate. Numerical results highlight the complex interplay between the detection threshold, spoofing attack probability and UAV altitude in the derived NE.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9739860,IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology,2022
Transmissibility-Based Health Monitoring of the Future Connected Autonomous Vehicles Networks,"Transmissibility is a mathematical model that relates a subset of a system’s outputs to another subset of outputs of the same system without knowledge of the external excitation or the dynamics of the system. This study investigates fault detection, localization, and mitigation of connected autonomous vehicles (CAV) platoons using transmissibility operators. A CAV platoon is a network of connected autonomous vehicles that communicate together to move in a specific path with the desired velocity. Failure in a physical component of a vehicle, or failure in the form of an internal delay, a cyber-attack, or a communication time-delay affects the safety and security of the CAV platoons. In this paper, we use measurements from sensors available in CAV platoons to identify transmissibility operators, which are used for health monitoring, fault localization, and fault mitigation in the platoon. We first consider the case of vehicle-to-cloud communication (V2C) to monitor the platoon’s health. Then, we assume that the platoon loses communication with the cloud, and we monitor the health of the platoon based on vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) communication. We apply the proposed technique to a model of the platoon obtained using the bond graph approach, and an experimental setup consisting of three connected autonomous robots.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9713720,IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology,2022
OverlapTransformer: An Efficient and Yaw-Angle-Invariant Transformer Network for LiDAR-Based Place Recognition,"Place recognition is an important capability for autonomously navigating vehicles operating in complex environments and under changing conditions. It is a key component for tasks such as loop closing in SLAM or global localization. In this letter, we address the problem of place recognition based on 3D LiDAR scans recorded by an autonomous vehicle. We propose a novel lightweight neural network exploiting the range image representation of LiDAR sensors to achieve fast execution with less than 2 ms per frame. We design a yaw-angle-invariant architecture exploiting a transformer network, which boosts the place recognition performance of our method. We evaluate our approach on the KITTI and Ford Campus datasets. The experimental results show that our method can effectively detect loop closures compared to the state-of-the-art methods and generalizes well across different environments. To evaluate long-term place recognition performance, we provide a novel dataset containing LiDAR sequences recorded by a mobile robot in repetitive places at different times.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9785497,IEEE Robotics and Automation Letters,2022
GNSS-Imaging Data Fusion for Integrity Enhancement in Autonomous Vehicles,"The transport sector is experiencing a fast and revolutionary development, moving toward the deployment of autonomous vehicles. Thus, the accuracy of the position information and the integrity of the navigation system have become key factors. In this article, we address the problem of the enhancement of the integrity of the position provided by a global navigation satellite system receiver by exploiting sensor fusion. To this aim, we estimate the lateral offset and heading of the vehicle with respect to a georeferenced roadway centerline from the images supplied by an on-board camera. Moreover, we perform integrity monitoring based on the implementation of the solution separation in the parity space. The numerical results indicate that the use of sensor fusion and digital map allows us to attain a longitudinal protection level reduction with respect to the case in which sensor fusion is not exploited. More specifically, a decrease of about 70% is achieved when a single constellation is used, while reduction is less relevant, about 15%, when two constellations are employed.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9754275,IEEE Transactions on Aerospace and Electronic Systems,2022
Measurement-Based Optimal Stealthy Attacks on Remote State Estimation,"This paper focuses on designing measurement-based optimal stealthy attacks for linear cyber-physical systems (CPSs), where attackers aim to deteriorate the performance of remote state estimation and keep  $\epsilon $ -stealthy to Kullback-Leibler divergence detector. Instead of constructing a linear attack directly, we consider a more general attack model with an arbitrary distribution to reveal the correlations between attacks and the stealth level  $\epsilon $ . By solving a convex optimization problem, the mean and variance of optimal attacks on common unprotected systems are obtained. Not limited to zero mean Gaussian attacks, the derived optimal attacks can also obey non-zero mean Gaussian distribution and degenerate to the former in some special cases. For protected systems equipped with encryption procedures, a general criterion for the selection of attacked channels is given. Finally, an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) example is provided to verify the effectiveness of the theoretical results.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9900373,IEEE Transactions on Information Forensics and Security,2022
A Sensor Fusion-Based GNSS Spoofing Attack Detection Framework for Autonomous Vehicles,"This paper presents a sensor fusion-based Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) spoofing attack detection framework for autonomous vehicles (AVs) that consists of two strategies: (i) comparison between predicted location shift—i.e., distance traveled between two consecutive timestamps—and inertial sensor based location shift in addition to monitoring of vehicle motion states—i.e., standstill/ in motion; and (ii) detection and classification of turns (left or right) along with detection of vehicle motion states. In the first strategy, data from low-cost in-vehicle inertial sensors—i.e., speedometer, accelerometer, and steering angle sensor—are fused and fed to a long short-term memory (LSTM) neural network to predict the distance an AV will travel between two consecutive timestamps. The second strategy combines k-Nearest Neighbors (k-NN) and Dynamic Time Warping (DTW) algorithms to detect a turn and then classify left and right turns using steering angle sensor output. In both strategies, the GNSS-derived speed is compared with speedometer output to improve the effectiveness of the framework presented in this paper. To prove the efficacy of the sensor fusion-based attack detection framework, attack datasets are created for four unique spoofing attack scenarios—turn-by-turn, overshoot, wrong turn, and stop, using the publicly available real-world Honda Research Institute Driving Dataset (HDD). Analyses conducted in this study reveal that the sensor fusion-based detection framework successfully detects all four types of spoofing attacks within the required computational latency threshold.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9868262,IEEE Transactions on Intelligent Transportation Systems,2022
Autonomous Single-Image Drone Exploration With Deep Reinforcement Learning and Mixed Reality,"Autonomous exploration is a longstanding goal of the robotics community. Aerial drone navigation has proven to be especially challenging. The stringent requirements on cost, weight, maneuverability, and power consumption do not allow exploration approaches to easily be employed or adapted to different types of environments. End-to-End Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) techniques based on Convolutional Networks approximators, which grant constant-time computation, predefined memory usage, and deliver high visual perception capabilities, represent a very promising alternative to current state of the art solutions relying on metric environment reconstruction. In this work, we address the autonomous exploration problem with aerial robots with a monocular camera based on DRL. Specifically, we propose a novel asymmetric actor-critic model for drone exploration that efficiently leverages ground truth information provided by the simulator environment to speed up learning and enhance final exploration performances. Furthermore, in order to reduce the sim-to-real gap for exploration, we present a novel mixed reality framework that allows an easier, smoother, and safer simulation to real-world transition. Both aspects allow to further exploit the great potential of simulation engines and contribute to reducing the risk associated with directly deploying algorithms on a physical platform with no intermediate step between the simulation and the real world. This is well-known to create several safety concerns and be dangerous when deploying aerial vehicles. Experimental results with a drone exploring multiple environments show the effectiveness of the proposed approach.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9721080,IEEE Robotics and Automation Letters,2022
Detection of False Data Injection Attack in Connected and Automated Vehicles via Cloud-Based Sandboxing,"In recent years, developments in vehicle-to-everything communication (V2X) have steadily increased in applications such as platooning and collision avoidance. V2X provides vehicles with long-range information regarding traffic congestion and routing, but also short and mid-range information allowing cooperative adaptive cruise control, automatic collision warnings, and others. Despite being potentially beneficial in several aspects, such interdependence poses a set of specific challenges from safety and reliability standpoint due to the possibility of cyber-attacks aimed at influencing the behavior of the vehicles. In this paper, a Cloud-based approach, a sandboxing framework is presented to detect the false data injection attack on connected and automated vehicles (CAVs). The sandboxing concept comes from computer security and it is adopted in a control framework as a way to isolate and evaluate the data exchanged by the CAVs affecting the vehicle control system. Numerical experiments are conducted to show the effectiveness of the approach using microscopic traffic simulation. Simulation results show that our proposed methodology is able to detect the false data injection attack existing in the V2X communication and identify the attacker in real-time less than 0.2 s.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9463871,IEEE Transactions on Intelligent Transportation Systems,2022
SLAP-IoD: Secure and Lightweight Authentication Protocol Using Physical Unclonable Functions for Internet of Drones in Smart City Environments,"With the emergence of the concept of smart city and the increasing demands for a range of drones, Internet of Drones (IoD) has achieved a variety of attention by providing multiple benefits in academia and industry. IoD offers numerous services, such as traffic monitoring, environmental monitoring, and disaster management by combining infrastructure, Internet of Things (IoT), and Flying Ad-Hoc Networks (FANET) in smart city environments. However, communication among drones is vulnerable to potential security threats because the sensitive messages in various applications are exchanged via an insecure channel in IoD-based smart city environments. Since IoDs can be operated in unattended environment with minimum human interventions, smart devices (e.g., drones and sensors) deployed in IoD architectures are vulnerable to physical capture attacks. In addition, drones are resource-constrained in terms of computation and communication overheads, and it is not much viable to apply public key cryptography (PKC) that requires high computation and communication overheads. Thus, we design a secure and lightweight authentication protocol using a physical unclonable function (PUF) for IoD to guarantee reliable and useful services in smart city environments, called SLAP-IoD. We prove the security of the SLAP-IoD using informal and formal security analyses using the broadly recognized Real-Or-Random (ROR) random oracle model, and also through the formal security verification using the widely-accepted Automated Validation of Internet Security-sensitive Protocols and Applications (AVISPA) security verification. Furthermore, we compare the performance of the SLAP-IoD with related schemes. Consequently, we show that SLAP-IoD offers better security and efficiency than other related schemes and is suitable for IoD-based smart city environments.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9816023,IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology,2022
A Heuristic Distributed Scheme to Detect Falsification of Mobility Patterns in Internet of Vehicles,"Autonomous vehicles in the Internet of Vehicles (IoV) have the ability to generate their mobility pattern in advance and share it with other vehicles or a central location. This information enables traffic systems to be aware of future traffic flow. However, the current classical traffic systems barely consider the spatial dependency of traffic data, and more advanced systems suffer from storage limitations. These problems will be exacerbated by the falsification of traffic data through corresponding data attacks, such as position forging attacks. This, in turn, negatively impacts the performance of traffic management systems. This article proposes a heuristic distributed scheme (HIDE) to validate the mobility pattern of vehicles by penalizing or rewarding vehicles based on the contacts’ conformation. HIDE enables every vehicle to consider the claimed mobility pattern of every neighboring vehicle that is exchanged, and assigns a penalty or reward to each received mobility pattern and share with cloudlets via roadside units (RSUs). These calculations are based on an efficient time-homogeneous semi-Markov process (THSMP) to predict the likelihood of the accuracy of mobility patterns. Cloudlets calculate a weight factor to determine if a vehicle is malicious. The validation results from THSMP reveal that a high correlation is achieved between the theoretical model and simulation. Also, the results show that the model fairly identifies the malicious vehicles and assigns a low weight of impact on them compared to normal vehicles.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9445064,IEEE Internet of Things Journal,2022
Cyber Attack Detection and Isolation for a Quadrotor UAV With Modified Sliding Innovation Sequences,"Common vulnerabilities in typical intelligent cyber-physical systems such as unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) can be easily exploited by cyber attackers to cause serious accidents and harm. For successful UAV operations, security against cyber attacks is imperative. In this paper, we propose a modified sliding innovation sequences (MSIS) detector, based on the extended Kalman filter optimal state estimation, for a dynamic quadrotor system to detect cyber attacks inflicted on both its actuators and sensors in real time. These cyber attacks include random attacks, false data injection (FDI) attacks and denial-of-service (DoS) attacks. The MSIS detector computes the operator norm of the normalized innovation (residual) sequence within a sliding time window and triggers the alarm if the value is above the preset threshold. For a quadrotor undergoing rapid turns in a complex trajectory, the detector observes a reduced false alarm rate as compared to other state estimation-based detectors. To address the initial estimation error problem, we implement an iteration procedure to initiate and calibrate the detector. By evaluating the sample covariance of the normalized innovation sequence, the MSIS detector has the capability to isolate cyber attacks. Finally, simulation results of a quadrotor in a periodic, complex trajectory flight are provided to verify the effectiveness of the MSIS detection and isolation method.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9764628,IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology,2022
Guest Editorial Special Issue on Space-Air-Ground Integrated Networks for Intelligent Transportation Systems,"Next-generation intelligent transportation systems (ITS) are envisioned to greatly improve transportation safety and efficiency by incorporating wireless communications and informatics technologies into transportation systems. As the cornerstone for ITS, vehicular communication networks enable vehicles on the go to exchange information with other vehicles and the external environments, which expect to play a significant role in supporting a variety of services such as road safety, traffic management, and infotainment. However, the existing terrestrial networks including dedicated shortrange communications (DSRC)-based networks and cellular networks alone cannot serve the vehicular applications very well in different scenarios, due to the inherent issues of deployment, coverage, and capacity. It is imperative to exploit other communication infrastructures, such as low-earth orbit (LEO) satellites, unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), and high-altitude platforms, to support vehicular applications better, resulting in space-air-ground integrated networks (SAGIN). SAGIN can provide more comprehensive and three-dimensional network connectivity for moving vehicles, anywhere and anytime, by exploiting their respective advantages in terms of coverage, flexibility, reliability, and availability.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9732628,IEEE Transactions on Intelligent Transportation Systems,2022
Safety of Automatic Emergency Braking in Platooning,"A platoon comprises a string of consecutive highly automated vehicles traveling together. Platooning allows for increased road utilization and reduced fuel consumption due to short inter-vehicular distances. Safety in terms of guaranteeing no rear-end collisions is of utmost importance for platooning systems to be deployed in practice. We compare how safely emergency braking can be handled by emerging vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) communications on the one hand and by radar-based measurements of existing automatic emergency braking systems (AEBS) on the other. We show that even under conservative assumptions on the V2V communications, such an approach significantly outperforms AEBS with an ideal radar sensor in terms of allowed inter-vehicle distances and response times. Furthermore, we design two emergency braking strategies for platooning based on V2V communications. The first braking strategy assumes centralized coordination by the leading vehicle and exploits necessary optimal conditions of a constrained optimization problem, whereas the second – the more conservative solution – assumes only local information and is distributed in nature. Both strategies are also compared with the AEBS.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9664486,IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology,2022
Any-Time Feasible Coordination for Multivehicle Systems,"This article proposes a distributed control methodology for the coordination of multiple connected and automated vehicles (CAVs). Each vehicle computes its local trajectory based on a model predictive control (MPC) law and communicates the result with other relevant vehicles. In an iterative negotiation process, planned trajectories are optimized within a sampling time step. Inspired by the Jacobi over-relaxation (JOR) algorithm, we develop a distributed Jacobi over-relaxation algorithm (DJOR) for vehicle coordination. The modified algorithm exploits the structure of the distributed problem setting in which coupling occurs only in a bilateral way. Besides being able to guarantee any-time feasibility that implies collision-freeness, the algorithm scales well, unlike the standard JOR algorithm. The DJOR algorithm allows for significantly less conservatism in the choice of the update weightings. As a result, much faster convergence rates can be expected. Furthermore, the collision avoidance guarantee is extended for unforeseen scenarios such as emergency braking. Using an exact penalty function formulation ensures that the distributed optimization problem remains feasible even in previously unforeseen cases. Numerical simulations of an intersection crossing scenario illustrate the presented approach and show its benefits in comparison with standard traffic rules and a centralized computation.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9612059,IEEE Transactions on Control Systems Technology,2022
On Social Interactions of Merging Behaviors at Highway On-Ramps in Congested Traffic,"Merging at highway on-ramps while interacting with other human-driven vehicles is challenging for autonomous vehicles (AVs). An efficient route to this challenge requires exploring and exploiting knowledge of the interaction process from demonstrations by humans. However, it is unclear what information (or environmental states) is utilized by the human driver to guide their behavior throughout the whole merging process. This paper provides quantitative analysis and evaluation of the merging behavior at highway on-ramps with congested traffic in a volume of time and space. Two types of social interaction scenarios are considered based on the social preferences of surrounding vehicles: courteous and rude. The significant levels of environmental states for characterizing the interactive merging process are empirically analyzed based on the real-world INTERACTION dataset. Experimental results reveal two fundamental mechanisms in the merging process: 1) Human drivers select different states to make sequential decisions at different moments of task execution; and 2) the social preference of surrounding vehicles can impact variable selection for making decisions. It implies that efficient decision-making design should filter out irrelevant information while considering social preference to achieve comparable human-level performance. These essential findings shed light on developing new decision-making approaches for AVs.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9511791,IEEE Transactions on Intelligent Transportation Systems,2022
Overriding Autonomous Driving Systems Using Adaptive Adversarial Billboards,"The success of deep neural networks (DNNs) has led to its increased deployment in various real-world applications, which provides strong incentives for motivated adversaries to manipulate the results and models generated by these algorithms. We present an automated, physically-realizable, dynamic adversarial attack to compromise an end-to-end trained DNN controlled autonomous vehicle. The attack is initiated by installing a billboard displaying videos on the roadside to incoming DNN controlled vehicles so that the vehicle tracks an adversary customized trajectory. The billboard contains an integrated camera to enable estimation of the pose of the approaching vehicle. The dynamic billboard images (i.e., a video) continuously adapt to the vehicle’s relative pose with respect to the billboard while being robust to variations in lighting, view angle, and weather. The attack’s effectiveness is shown on a recently developed off-the-shelf high-fidelity simulator, CARLA, for autonomous vehicles. CARLA utilizes an end-to-end learning-based autonomous navigation system. The proposed approach is applicable to other end-to-end trained autonomous cyber-physical systems.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9514525,IEEE Transactions on Intelligent Transportation Systems,2022
Multilines Imaging Approach for Mini-UAV Radar Imaging System,"This letter deals with an imaging strategy able to manage effectively data collected on multiple lines by means of a Mini-Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (M-UAV) radar system operating in Sounder mode. The strategy, named multilines imaging approach (MIA), allows an effective 3-D pseudo-representation of the investigated volume. At the first step, MIA faces the problem of reconstructing 2-D domains (slices) by exploiting data collected on one or more lines. Then, MIA interpolates the 2-D reconstructions to provide the 3-D representation.

On the Achievability of Submeter-Accurate UAV Navigation With Cellular Signals Exploiting Loose Network Synchronization,"A framework that could achieve submeter-level unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) horizontal navigation in multipath-free environments with cellular carrier phase measurements is developed. This framework exploits the “loose” synchronization between cellular base transceiver station (BTS) clocks. It is shown through extensive experimental data that the beat frequency stability of cellular BTSs approaches that of atomic standards and that the clock deviations can be realized as a stable autoregressive moving average model. This BTS clock model is referred to as loose network synchronization. A rule-of-thumb is established for clustering the clock deviations to minimize the position estimation error, while significantly reducing the computational complexity. The presented models allow the UAV to achieve sustained carrier phase-based meter- to submeter-accurate navigation. To demonstrate the efficacy of the developed framework, this article presents three UAV flight experiments in Southern California, USA, utilizing signals from different cellular providers transmitting at different frequencies. The three experiments took place in open, semiurban environments with nearly multipath-free, line-of-sight (LOS) conditions, in which the UAV traveled 1.72, 3.07, and 0.61 km, achieving a horizontal position root mean squared error of 36.61, 88.58, and 89.33 cm, respectively, with respect to the UAV’s on-board navigation system.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9745849,IEEE Transactions on Aerospace and Electronic Systems,2022
Adversarial Evaluation of Autonomous Vehicles in Lane-Change Scenarios,"Autonomous vehicles must be comprehensively evaluated before deployed in cities and highways. However, most existing evaluation approaches for autonomous vehicles are static and lack adaptability, so they are usually inefficient in generating challenging scenarios for tested vehicles. In this paper, we propose an adaptive evaluation framework to efficiently evaluate autonomous vehicles in adversarial environments generated by deep reinforcement learning. Considering the multimodal nature of dangerous scenarios, we use ensemble models to represent different local optimums for diversity. We then utilize a nonparametric Bayesian method to cluster the adversarial policies. The proposed method is validated in a typical lane-change scenario that involves frequent interactions between the ego vehicle and the surrounding vehicles. Results show that the adversarial scenarios generated by our method significantly degrade the performance of the tested vehicles. We also illustrate different patterns of generated adversarial environments, which can be used to infer the weaknesses of the tested vehicles.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9468363,IEEE Transactions on Intelligent Transportation Systems,2022
Location-Based Schemes for Mitigating Cyber Threats on Connected and Automated Vehicles: A Survey and Design Framework,"The increased automation and connectivity of vehicles and road infrastructure can make future transportation systems more efficient and smarter and enable new transportation business models. Connected and automated vehicles (CAVs) may form a group of autonomous fleets to transform today’s shared mobility services and also play the role of mobile sensors, which share real-time traffic and road information for transportation management. However, these technological advancements also lead to new cyber and physical threats that cause safety hazards or other undesired consequences. Although there have been a large number of papers about identifying and mitigating each type of threat, the lack of design support still challenges security engineering for developing CAVs. This limits the engineering capabilities of original equipment manufacturers to prioritize among multiple system properties, including safety, security, and privacy, and dealing with ever-changing attack surfaces and the power of attackers. This paper surveys security vulnerabilities and defense mechanisms for CAVs from an engineering design perspective. We illustrate how to identify and mitigate physical threats that compromise the safety of individual vehicles and cyber threats that disrupt newly CAV-enabled transportation services in a systematic way. An integrated security engineering process and a multi-layer design framework are presented for providing traceability and guidance in threat identification and mitigation.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9284448,IEEE Transactions on Intelligent Transportation Systems,2022
Toward Trusted and Secure Communication Among Multiple Internal Modules in CAV,"By equipping various sensors and analyzing sensed data, vehicles can perform automatic driving; these vehicles are known as connected and autonomous vehicles (CAVs). In CAVs, tampered data will result in incorrect driving decisions. Hence, secure data transmission should be ensured to enable correct life-critical decisions. Untrusted resource-constrained modules allow attackers to obtain private data from CAVs, such as the key. Benefitting from trusted computing, the proposed scheme can verify the trusted status of internal modules and achieve secure data transmission by adopting the remote attestation and hash message authentication code. The scheme is proven to be secure in the random oracle model under the computational Diffie–Hellman problem. Furthermore, we perform experiments and evaluate the performance using Intel Software Guard eXtensions, which provide part of the trusted computing function. The experimental results show that the scheme could be efficient and suitable for CAVs.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9438685,IEEE Internet of Things Journal,2021
Robust Resource Allocation Algorithm for Energy-Harvesting-Based D2D Communication Underlaying UAV-Assisted Networks,"Energy efficiency (EE) is a significant performance indicator in unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV)-assisted communication networks for providing a balance between power consumption minimization and transmission rate maximization. However, most of the current works focus on the transmission rate maximization under perfect channel state information (CSI) and exact coordinate information, which is too ideal in practical systems due to channel estimation errors and coordinate estimation errors. Thus, robust resource allocation algorithms with imperfect CSI and coordinate information are critically important to reduce users’ outages and improve system robustness. In this article, a robust EE maximization problem with channel uncertainties and coordinate uncertainties is formulated for an energy harvesting-based device-to-device (D2D) communication underlaying UAV-assisted network under some necessary constraints, which involve the outage probability constraints of ground terminals, the flight altitude constraint of the UAV, the minimum harvested energy constraints of D2D users, and the transmission time constraint. Both radio resource allocation and the flight altitude are jointly optimized based on the worst case approach. The considered nonconvex problem is transformed into a convex one by exploiting variable relaxation and variable substitution approaches. The Lagrange dual theory is used to derive the closed-form expressions of robust resource allocation. Simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm by comparing it with the benchmark algorithms in terms of EE and robustness.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9425525,IEEE Internet of Things Journal,2021
Interdependence-Aware Game-Theoretic Framework for Secure Intelligent Transportation Systems,"The operation of future intelligent transportation systems (ITSs), communications infrastructure (CI), and power grids (PGs) will be highly interdependent. In particular, autonomous connected vehicles require CI resources to operate, and, thus, communication failures can result in nonoptimality in the ITS flow in terms of traffic jams and fuel consumption. Similarly, CI components, e.g., base stations (BSs) can be impacted by failures in the electric grid that is powering them. Thus, malicious attacks on the PG can lead to failures in both the CI and the ITSs. To this end, in this article, the security of an ITS against indirect attacks carried out through the PG is studied in an interdependent PG-CI-ITS scenario. In the considered scenario, an attacker can induce nonoptimality in the ITS or disrupt a particular set of streets by attacking the PG components while remaining stealthy from the ITS administrators. To defend against such attacks, the administrator of the interdependent critical infrastructure can allocate backup power sources (BPSs) at every BS to compensate for the power loss caused by the attacker. However, due to budget limitations, the administrator must consider the importance of each BS in light of the PG risk of failure, while allocating the BPSs. In this regard, a rigorous analytical framework is proposed to model the interdependencies between the ITS, CI, and PG. Next, a one-to-one relationship between the PG components and ITS streets is derived in order to capture the effect of the PG components’ failure on the optimality of the traffic flow in the streets. Moreover, the problem of BPS allocation is formulated using a Stackelberg game framework and the Stackelberg equilibrium (SE) of the game is characterized. Simulation results show that the derived SE outperforms any other BPS allocation strategy and can be scalable in linear time with respect to the size of the interdependent infrastructure.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9184000,IEEE Internet of Things Journal,2021
An Efficient Strategy for Accurate Detection and Localization of UAV Swarms,"Unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) swarms have shown great potential for Internet of Things (IoT). Meantime, its malicious use may cause huge threat to the national security. UAV swarms show the characteristic of high density which poses formidable challenges to radar resolution in the defense of critical areas. In this article, we consider a radar equipped with the coprime array, and then, use the coherent long-time integration (LTI) technique and gridless sparse technique to detect and localize UAVs in a swarm. This strategy takes full account of advantages of the coprime array, coherent LTI technique, and gridless sparse technique, i.e.: 1) the coprime array can provide a larger array aperture than the uniform linear array with the same number of array elements to relieve the stress of the gridless sparse technique and 2) the combination of coherent LTI technique and gridless sparse technique can maximize their advantages and make up for their shortcomings. By mathematical analyses and extensive numerical examples, we show the superiority of the proposed strategy in terms of accurate detection and localization of UAV swarms.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9372970,IEEE Internet of Things Journal,2021
Intelligent Drone-assisted Anonymous Authentication and Key Agreement for 5G/B5G Vehicular Ad-Hoc Networks,"Drones (or unmanned aerial vehicles) can play many assistant roles in the complex communication network, and can be used as an air relay node to support ground communications. It is expected to solve the sustainable communication problem of 5G/ beyond 5G (B5G) vehicular ad-hoc networks by using drones in rural or mountainous areas where communication is limited. In this paper, considering the emergency of vehicular ad-hoc networks, we design an assistant communication scheme based on the intelligent drone to help vehicles securely communicate with each other under adversary but actual conditions. Besides, the real identity of the vehicle must also be protected to prevent illegal elements from obtaining, and using them for crimes. To effectively assist vehicle communication, and ensure that vehicle privacy is not compromised, we propose an intelligent drone-assisted anonymous authentication, and key agreement for 5G/B5G vehicular ad-hoc networks. Utilizing the widely-used Real-Or-Random (ROR) model, and the formal security analysis, the proposed scheme is proven to be resistant to several attacks. Moreover, the proposed scheme has better performance in terms of computation overhead, and communication overhead through performance evaluation.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9219201,IEEE Transactions on Network Science and Engineering,2021
The Optimal and the Greedy: Drone Association and Positioning Schemes for Internet of UAVs,"This work considers the deployment of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) over a predefined area to serve a number of ground users. Due to the heterogeneous nature of the network, the UAVs may cause severe interference to the transmissions of each other. Hence, a judicious design of the user-UAV association and UAV locations is desired. A potential game is defined where the players are the UAVs. The potential function is the total sum rate of the users. The agents' utility in the potential game is their marginal contribution to the global welfare or their so-called wonderful life utility. A game-theoretic learning algorithm, binary log-linear learning (BLLL), is then applied to the problem. Given the potential game structure, a consequence of our utility design, the stochastically stable states using BLLL are guaranteed to be the potential maximizers. Hence, we optimally solve the joint user-UAV association and 3-D-location problem. Next, we exploit the submodular features of the sum rate function for a given configuration of UAVs to design an efficient greedy algorithm. Despite the simplicity of the greedy algorithm, it comes with a performance guarantee of 1-1/e of the optimal solution. To further reduce the number of iterations, we propose another heuristic greedy algorithm that provides very good results. Our simulations show that, in practice, the proposed greedy approaches achieve significant performance in a few iterations.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9392003,IEEE Internet of Things Journal,2021
A Provenance-Aware Distributed Trust Model for Resilient Unmanned Aerial Vehicle Networks,"An unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) network is an emerging industrial IoT network for collaborative UAV communication and management. The open architecture and dynamic topology, which provide functional benefits, unfortunately make UAVNs more vulnerable to a variety of attacks. In UAVNs, malicious nodes not only eavesdrop the communications between UAV nodes but also attempt to attack the entire network by injecting or modifying messages. This work proposes a provenance-aware distributed trust model, named UAV-pro, for UAVNs that aim to achieve accurate peer-to-peer trust assessment and maximize the delivery of correct messages received by destination nodes while minimizing the message delay and communication cost under resource-constrained network environments. Provenance refers to the history of ownership of messages transmitted on the network. The behavior of message creators and operators can be effectively evaluated based on message integrity, then generate the observational evidence. We collect the observational evidence for distributed trust evaluation, then identify malicious nodes in the network and isolate them from the network. UAVN-pro takes a data-driven approach to reduce resource consumption in the presence of selfish or malicious nodes while ensuring the safe transmission of data by digital signature technology. The experimental results show that UAVN-pro works are compatible with the existing UAV network routing protocols, and can effectively identify attacks, such as the black hole, gray hole, message modification, fake recommendation, and fake identity in UAV networks. UAVN-pro is superior to the existing security model in terms of detection rate, delivery rate, and system energy consumption in most cases.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9162060,IEEE Internet of Things Journal,2021
Supporting IoT With Rate-Splitting Multiple Access in Satellite and Aerial-Integrated Networks,"To satisfy the explosive access demands of Internet-of-Things (IoT) devices, various kinds of multiple access techniques have received much attention. In this article, we investigate the multicast communication of a satellite and aerial-integrated network (SAIN) with rate-splitting multiple access (RSMA), where both satellite and unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) components are controlled by network management center and operate in the same frequency band. Considering a content delivery scenario, the UAV subnetwork adopts the RSMA to support massive access of IoT devices (IoTDs) and achieve desired performances of interference suppression, spectral efficiency, and hardware complexity. We first formulate an optimization problem to maximize the sum rate of the considered system subject to the signal-interference-plus-noise-ratio requirements of IoTDs and per-antenna power constraints at the UAV and satellite. To solve this nonconvex optimization problem, we exploit the sequential convex approximation and the first-order Taylor expansion to convert the original optimization problem into a solvable one with the rank-one constraint, and then propose an iterative penalty function-based algorithm to solve it. Finally, simulation results verify that the proposed method can effectively suppress the mutual interference and improve the system sum rate compared to the benchmark schemes.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9324793,IEEE Internet of Things Journal,2021
Secure and Efficient Honey List-Based Authentication Protocol for Vehicular Ad Hoc Networks,"Vehicular Ad Hoc Network (VANET) and Internet of Vehicle (IoV) technologies are particularly attracting attention from industrial communities because of the intelligent transportation systems of smart city technologies. Vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) communication of VANET can guarantee traffic system management and road safety. However, V2V communication cannot manage many vehicles as a whole, so it needs to be segmented and communicated by region. Therefore, considering locality, key agreement is made for V2V communication of the same or different regions. Moreover, traditional public key infrastructure (PKI) and Kerberos systems to be applied in a real environment incur computational overhead. Therefore, we proposed a lightweight protocol for dynamic properties of vehicles for regional segmentation management and overhead resolution. In addition, because vehicle information is transmitted through public channels, our protocol uses mutual authentication and honey_list technology to ensure security against a variety of attacks. It provides verification of safety through a detailed security analysis using the formal analysis using the widely-accepted Real-Or-Random (ROR) model, and verifies formal security using the Automated Validation of Internet Security Protocols and Applications (AVISPA) software tool and non-mathematical (informal) security analysis. In addition, a detailed comparative study that the proposed scheme can be applied in the communication environment between actual vehicles as compared to other existing competing schemes.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9468344,IEEE Transactions on Network Science and Engineering,2021
Dynamics of Laser-Charged UAVs: A Battery Perspective,"In this article, we aim to sustain unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV)-based missions for longer periods of times through different techniques. First, we consider on-the-mission UAV recharging by a low-power laser source (below 1 kW). In order to achieve the maximal energy gain from the low-power laser source, we propose an operational compromise, which consists of the UAV resting over buildings with cleared line of sight to the laser source. Second, to provide a precise energy consumption/harvesting estimation at the UAV, we investigate the latter's dynamics in a mission environment. Indeed, we study the UAV's battery dynamics by leveraging the electrical models for motors and battery. Subsequently, using these models, the path planning problem in a particular Internet-of-Things-based usecase is revisited from the battery perspective. The objective is to extend the UAV's operation time using both laser-charging and accurate battery level estimation. Through a graph theory approach, the problem is solved optimally, and compared to benchmark trajectory approaches. Numerical results demonstrate the efficiency of this novel battery perspective for all path planning approaches. In contrast, we found that the energy perspective is very conservative and does not exploit optimally the available energy resources. Nevertheless, we propose a simple adjustment method to correct the energy perspective, by carefully evaluating the energy as a function of the UAV motion regimes. Finally, the impact of several parameters, such as turbulence and distance to charging source, is studied.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9310251,IEEE Internet of Things Journal,2021
Multihop V2U Path Availability Analysis in UAV-Assisted Vehicular Networks,"The work presented in this article aims at improving the ground vehicle connectivity in the context of an intermittent vehicle-to-UAV (V2U) communication scenario where vehicles opportunistically establish time-limited connectivity with passing by unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) serving as flying base stations responsible for routing incoming vehicle data over backbone networks and/or the Internet. As opposed to existing work in the literature where vehicles are only allowed to establish direct connectivity with in-range UAVs, this work aims at also exploiting the possible formation of vehicular clusters and, hence, the feasibility of intervehicular communications to establish multihop paths connecting source vehicles to destination UAVs. A mathematical model is presented for the purpose of capturing the nodal (i.e., vehicles and UAVs) mobility dynamics and derive an expression for the overall V2U connectivity probability as well as the overall average vehicle connection time. Extensive simulations are conducted in order to adduce the validity and accuracy of the proposed model and provide further insights into the connectivity sensibility to fundamental system parameters.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9312668,IEEE Internet of Things Journal,2021
Malware on Internet of UAVs Detection Combining String Matching and Fourier Transformation,"Advanced persistent threat (APT), with intense penetration, long duration, and high customization, has become one of the most grievous threats to cybersecurity. Furthermore, the design and development of Internet-of-Things (IoT) devices often do not focus on security, leading APT to extend to IoT, such as the Internet of emerging unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs). Whether malware with attack payload can be successfully implanted into UAVs or not is the key to APT on the Internet of UAVs. APT malware on UAVs establishes communication with the command and control (C&C) server to achieve remote control for UAVs-aware information stealing. Existing effective methods detect malware by analyzing malicious behaviors generated during C&C communication. However, APT malware usually adopts a low-traffic attack mode, a large amount of normal traffic is mixed in each attack step, to avoid virus checking and killing. Therefore, it is difficult for traditional malware detection methods to discover APT malware on UAVs that carry weak abnormal signals. Fortunately, we found that most APT attacks use domain name system (DNS) to locate C&C server of malware for information transmission periodically. This behavior will leave some records in the network flow and DNS logs, which provides us with an opportunity to identify infected internal UAVs and external malicious domain names. This article proposes an APT malware on the Internet of UAVs detection method combining string matching and Fourier transformation based on DNS traffic, which is able to handle encrypted and obfuscated traffic due to packet payloads independence. We preprocessed the collected network traffic by converting DNS timestamps of DNS request to strings and used the trained random forest model to discover APT malware domain names based on features extracted through string-matching-based periodicity detection and Fourier transformation-based periodicity detection. The proposed method has been evaluated on the data set, including part of normal domains from the normal traffic and malicious domains marked by security experts from APT malware traffic. Experimental results have shown that our proposed detection method can achieve the accuracy of 94%, which is better than the periodicity detection algorithm alone. Moreover, the proposed method does not need to set the confidence to filter the periodicity with high confidence.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9220767,IEEE Internet of Things Journal,2021
Energy-Efficient UAV-Enabled Data Collection via Wireless Charging: A Reinforcement Learning Approach,"In this article, we study the application of unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) for data collection with wireless charging, which is crucial for providing seamless coverage and improving system performance in the next-generation wireless networks. To this end, we propose a reinforcement learning-based approach to plan the route of UAV to collect sensor data from sensor devices scattered in the physical environment. Specifically, the physical environment is divided into multiple grids, where one spot for UAV hovering as well as the wireless charging of UAV is located at the center of each grid. Each grid has a spot for the UAV to hover, and moreover, there is a wireless charger at the center of each grid, which can provide wireless charging to UAV when it is hovering in the grid. When the UAV lacks energy, it can be charged by the wireless charger at the spot. By taking into account the collected data amount as well as the energy consumption, we formulate the problem of data collection with UAV as a Markov decision problem, and exploit Q-learning to find the optimal policy. In particular, we design the reward function considering the energy efficiency of UAV flight and data collection, based on which Q-table is updated for guiding the route of UAV. Through extensive simulation results, we verify that our proposed reward function can achieve a better performance in terms of the average throughput, delay of data collection, as well as the energy efficiency of UAV, in comparison with the conventional capacity-based reward function.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9321340,IEEE Internet of Things Journal,2021
Three-Dimensional-Map-Based Trajectory Design in UAV-Aided Wireless Localization Systems,"This article considers the problem of localizing outdoor ground radio users with the help of an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) on the basis of received signal strength (RSS) measurements in an urban environment. We assume that the propagation model parameters are not known a priori, and depending on the UAV location, the UAV-user link can experience either Line-of-Sight (LoS) or Non-Line-of-Sight (NLoS) propagation condition. We assume that a 3-D map of the environment is available which the UAV can exploit in the localization process. Based on the proposed map-aided estimator, we devise an optimal UAV trajectory to accelerate the learning process under a limited mission time. To do so, we borrow tools, such as Fisher information from the theory of optimal experiment design. Our map-aided estimator achieves superior localization accuracy compared to the map-unaware methods, and our simulations show that optimized UAV trajectory achieves superior learning performance compared to random trajectories.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9186164,IEEE Internet of Things Journal,2021
Location-Based Robust Beamforming Design for Cellular-Enabled UAV Communications,"Cellular communications have been regarded as promising approaches to deliver high-broadband communication links for unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), which have been widely deployed to conduct various missions, e.g., precision agriculture, forest monitoring, and border patrol. However, the unique features of aerial UAVs, including high-altitude manipulation, 3-D mobility, and rapid velocity changes, pose challenging issues to realize reliable cellular-enabled UAV communications, especially with the severe intercell interference generated by UAVs. To deal with this issue, we propose a novel position-based robust beamforming algorithm through complementarily integrating the navigation information and wireless channel information to improve the performance of cellular-enabled UAV communications. Specifically, in order to achieve the optimal beam weight vector, the navigation information of the UAV system is innovatively exploited to predict the changes of the direction-of-Arrival (DoA) angle. To fight against the high mobility of UAV operations, an optimization problem is formed by considering the tapered surface of DoA angle and solved to correct the inherent position error. Comprehensive simulation experiments are conducted and the results show that the proposed robust beamforming algorithm could achieve over 90% DoA estimation error reduction and up to 14-dB SINR gain compared with five benchmark beamforming algorithms, including linearly constrained minimum variance (LCMV), position-based beamforming, diagonal loading (DL), robust capon beamforming (RCB), and robust LCMV algorithm.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9214955,IEEE Internet of Things Journal,2021
"Robust 60-GHz Beamforming for UAVs: Experimental Analysis of Hovering, Blockage, and Beam Selection","Unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) mounted millimeter-wave (mmWave) base stations as well as aerial backhaul links will enable on-demand deployment of network resources. However, prior work has shown aerial links are prone to the frequent disruption caused by: 1) constant hovering due to GPS inaccuracies that impact narrow beamwidths; 2) blockages in the direct line of sight; and 3) suboptimal beam selection, especially if reduced angular sectors are searched in a highly dynamic environment. This article characterizes the impact of each of these phenomena for aerial mmWave links and proposes methods to distinctly identify when they occur in isolation or in combination during deployment. Furthermore, it also proposes corrective actions at the UAV, appropriate for the specific type(s) of impacting events: physical displacement from its earlier location, angular rotation around its vertical axis, or beamwidth adjustment. Our approach relies on exploiting the information contained in the angular domain of a large data set of experimentally collected beam-selection outcomes, under the above practical scenarios. We incorporate GPS accuracy models and antenna radiation patterns to create a robust model of potential outages. We then propose device-agnostic algorithms that jointly optimize UAVs' physical movement and the beamforming procedure. The experimental results obtained by mounting a pair of 60-GHz channel sounders on M600 DJI UAVs reveal loss reduction of up to 74.7%, translated into 260% physical layer bit-rate improvement compared to the classical 802.11ad standards-defined approach.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9177168,IEEE Internet of Things Journal,2021

Robust Learning-Enabled Intelligence for the Internet of Things: A Survey From the Perspectives of Noisy Data and Adversarial Examples,"The Internet of Things (IoT) has been widely adopted in a range of verticals, e.g., automation, health, energy, and manufacturing. Many of the applications in these sectors, such as self-driving cars and remote surgery, are critical and high stakes applications, calling for advanced machine learning (ML) models for data analytics. Essentially, the training and testing data that are collected by massive IoT devices may contain noise (e.g., abnormal data, incorrect labels, and incomplete information) and adversarial examples. This requires high robustness of ML models to make reliable decisions for IoT applications. The research of robust ML has received tremendous attention from both academia and industry in recent years. This article will investigate the state of the art and representative works of robust ML models that can enable high resilience and reliability of IoT intelligence. Two aspects of robustness will be focused on, i.e., when the training data of ML models contain noises and adversarial examples, which may typically happen in many real-world IoT scenarios. In addition, the reliability of both neural networks and reinforcement learning framework will be investigated. Both of these two ML paradigms have been widely used in handling data in IoT scenarios.

Toward Achieving Fine-Grained Access Control of Data in Connected and Autonomous Vehicles,"A connected and autonomous vehicle (CAV) is often fitted with a large number of onboard sensors and applications to support autonomous driving functions. Based on the current research, little work on applications' access to in-vehicle data has been done. Furthermore, most existing autonomous driving operating systems lack authentication and encryption units. As such, applications can excessively obtain confidential information, such as vehicle location and owner preferences and even upload it to the cloud, threatening the security of the vehicle and the privacy of the owner. In this study, we propose a fine-grained access control scheme to restrict applications' access to data in CAVs (FGAC-inCAVs). First, we present a system model composed of the following elements: a trusted third party (TTP), which is a fully trusted authority; perception components like sensors, which can capture the road information (pictures, videos, etc.); and multiple applications. Then, a fast attribute-based encryption (ABE) is presented, and security analysis also shows it is secure against selective and chosen-plaintext attacks. Furthermore, we propose a key update scheme based on the Chinese remainder theorem (CRT). Finally, the theoretical analysis and simulation experiments demonstrate its feasibility and efficiency.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9277522,IEEE Internet of Things Journal,2021
Adaptive Square Attack: Fooling Autonomous Cars With Adversarial Traffic Signs,"To better understand the road condition and make correct driving decisions, traffic sign recognition becomes a crucial component commonly equipped in the vision system of modern autonomous cars. The state-of-the-art traffic sign recognition models are designed with the backbones of deep neural networks (DNNs) since DNNs are powerful to extract more effective visual features that benefit recognition performance. As the recent studies on adversarial attacks have shown that DNNs are easy to be fooled by perturbed images and lead to misclassification, in this article, we explore the vulnerability of the DNN-based traffic sign recognition model. Most existing adversarial attack methods limitedly focus on the white-box attack on the recognition models whose underlying configurations (e.g., network architectures and parameters) are accessible. Differently, we propose a novel attacking method dubbed adaptive square attack (ASA) that can accomplish the black-box attack, i.e., bypassing the access the configurations of the recognition models. Specifically, the proposed ASA method employs an efficient sampling strategy that can generate perturbations for traffic sign images with fewer query times. Extensive experiments on the benchmark data set German traffic sign recognition benchmark with large-scale traffic sign images for autonomous cars show that our proposed ASA method is advanced to perform the black-box attack with high efficiency. Although the generated adversarial traffic sign images by the proposed ASA method are visually similar to the raw images with almost imperceptible differences, they can successfully lead to the misclassification of the state-of-the-art recognition model.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9165820,IEEE Internet of Things Journal,2021
Learning in the Air: Secure Federated Learning for UAV-Assisted Crowdsensing,"Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) combined with artificial intelligence (AI) have opened a revolutionized way for mobile crowdsensing (MCS). Conventional AI models, built on aggregation of UAVs' sensing data (typically contain private and sensitive user information), may arise severe privacy and data misuse concerns. Federated learning, as a promising distributed AI paradigm, has opened up possibilities for UAVs to collaboratively train a shared global model without revealing their local sensing data. However, there still exist potential security and privacy threats for UAV-assisted crowdsensing with federated learning due to vulnerability of central curator, unreliable contribution recording, and low-quality shared local models. In this paper, we propose SFAC, a secure federated learning framework for UAV-assisted MCS. Specifically, we first introduce a blockchain-based collaborative learning architecture for UAVs to securely exchange local model updates and verify contributions without the central curator. Then, by applying local differential privacy, we design a privacy-preserving algorithm to protect UAVs' privacy of updated local models with desirable learning accuracy. Furthermore, a two-tier reinforcement learning-based incentive mechanism is exploited to promote UAVs' high-quality model sharing when explicit knowledge of network parameters are not available in practice. Extensive simulations are conducted, and the results demonstrate that the proposed SFAC can effectively improve utilities for UAVs, promote high-quality model sharing, and ensure privacy protection in federated learning, compared with existing schemes.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9159929,IEEE Transactions on Network Science and Engineering,2021
Coverage Guided Differential Adversarial Testing of Deep Learning Systems,"Deep learning is increasingly applied to safety-critical application domains such as autonomous cars and medical devices. It is of significant importance to ensure their reliability and robustness. In this paper, we propose DLFuzz, the coverage guided differential adversarial testing framework to guide deep learing systems exposing incorrect behaviors. DLFuzz keeps minutely mutating the input to maximize the neuron coverage and the prediction difference between the original input and the mutated input, without manual labeling effort or cross-referencing oracles from other systems with the same functionality. We also design multiple novel strategies for neuron selection to improve the neuron coverage. The incorrect behaviors obtained by DLFuzz are then exploited for retraining and improving the dependability of the models. We present empirical evaluations on two well-known data-sets to demonstrate its effectiveness. Compared with DeepXplore, the state-of-the-art deep learning white-box testing framework, DLFuzz does not require extra efforts to find similar functional deep learning systems for cross-referencing check. But DLFuzz could generate $338.59\%$ more adversarial inputs with $89.82\%$ smaller perturbations, while maintaining the identities of the original inputs. DLFuzz also managed to averagely obtain $2.86\%$ higher neuron coverage, and save $20.11\%$ time consumption with respect to DeepXplore. We then evaluate the effectiveness of strategies for neuron selection, and demonstrated that all these strategies perform better than DeepXplore.

Full-Duplex UAV Relaying for Multiple User Pairs,"Based on the advantages of small size, lightweight, as well as flexible deployment and recycling, unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) has been more and more widely used in military and civilian. As flying relays, UAVs can quickly set up relay communication links for different missions, to enhance the receiving signal power, increase the system capacity, and expand the communication coverage. In this article, we investigate full-duplex (FD) UAV relaying for multiple source-destination pairs. To fully exploit the flying flexibility of the UAV in serving multiple source-destination pairs, we propose a scheduling protocol that exploits time-division multiple access (TDMA) to serve different source-destination pairs in turns when flying along an optimized trajectory. Then, we further formulate a joint optimization problem of the TDMA-based user scheduling, the dynamic UAV trajectory, and the UAV transmit power to maximize the system throughput. The formulated problem is nonconvex that makes it difficult to solve directly, hence we propose an iterative algorithm to obtain an approximate optimal solution based on block coordinate descent and successive convex optimization techniques. Simulation results demonstrate that our proposed FD-based UAV relaying network achieves significant throughput gains compared with the half-duplex (HD) baseline, and the TDMA-based protocol outperforms the OFDMA-based ones with fixed UAV position/trajectory when the UAV helps relay information for multiple source-destination pairs.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9209050,IEEE Internet of Things Journal,2021
IoT-Ready Energy-Autonomous Parking Sensor Device,"Finding a free parking lot contributes largely to a total traffic congestion and increases gas emissions in urban and overpopulated cities. Recent advances in smart parking systems adopt Internet of Things (IoT) concepts which tend to improve traffic bottlenecks by providing information about available parking lots. The detection of vehicle presence at the parking lot usually means adopting solutions comprised of power-hungry and battery-operated sensor devices. In this article a hardware-based approach is introduced which aims at building a self-powered and autonomous sensing node equipped with supercapacitors (battery less) to feel the vehicle presence. For purposes of detection, solar-based energy harvester and wake-up trigger prototype is considered along with a Bluetooth low-energy (BLE) radio. The joint use of such technologies is exploited to develop a power autonomous node capable of cost-effectively sensing the car presence and transmitting the parking lot status. The developed triggering system consumes only 150 nA making it suitable as a low-power solution. To initiate the trigger only 6.5 W/m2 in light level change is required comparing the two panels, which is more than adequate as the comparison of solar irradiance measured under the vehicle against diffuse horizontal irradiance shows a significant difference. The developed prototype uses a magnetometer to verify the vehicle presence upon trigger generation and BLE 5.0 technology for status change update, while supercapacitor discharge lifetime duration is estimated to be around 13 days in harsh conditions without charging from solar cells.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9223726,IEEE Internet of Things Journal,2021
Joint UAV Position and Power Optimization for Accurate Regional Localization in Space-Air Integrated Localization Network,"Accurate location estimation of Internet-of-Things (IoT) devices within an Area of Interest (AoI) is a challenging issue, especially in a global navigation satellite system (GNSS)-constrained environment. In this article, we present a space-air integrated localization network (SAILN) architecture to exploit the advantages of the unmanned-aerial-vehicle (UAV)-based localization through joint position and power optimization (JPPO) strategies. In SAILN, UAVs can utilize their flexible movement to obtain the line-of-sight (LOS) path with a high probability, thereby providing the potential IoT devices in the AoI with supplementary localization information. The JPPO of UAVs aims to improve the regional localization accuracy for the entire AoI, considering the no-fly-zone (NFZ) and the total energy constraint. We propose the average localization accuracy increment (ALAI) of the sampling points in the AoI as the metric to measure the performance of SAILN compared with that of only satellites, which is regarded as the objective to formulate the JPPO problems for UAV operations in both static and dynamic SAILN. The intractable problems can be resolved by the pure genetic algorithm (PGA) that has a low computational cost and unique features suiting the JPPO of UAVs. Then, by taking advantage of the ALAI convexity to the UAVs' power, we propose a power reallocation-based two-step algorithm (PRTSA) to further explore an improved JPPO solution. Simulation results validate that the proposed PRTSA can obtain a higher localization accuracy for the entire AoI than the PGA and the other straightforward baselines.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9220776,IEEE Internet of Things Journal,2021
A Machine-Learning-Based Data-Centric Misbehavior Detection Model for Internet of Vehicles,"The Internet of Things (IoT) boosts road safety, efficiency, and infotainment by connecting vehicles to form the Internet of Vehicles (IoV). Specifically to safety, IoV complements autonomous cars beyond sensors' line-of-sight, facilitating vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) communications in a smart transportation environment. The correctness of data exchanged among vehicles is paramount to ensure vehicles behave as per norms. Traditional misbehavior detection methods hardly defend vehicular security effectively due to rapid dynamics and location privacy. In particular, those node-centric classifiers become ill-fit in IoV. This work proposes a data-centric misbehavior detection model based on supervised machine learning (ML). The work also integrates plausibility checks with ML techniques and instantiates the model with six algorithms to demonstrate their comparative effectiveness. In addition to misbehavior detection, the model classifies attack types to support validating countermeasures. Specifically, the work analyzes the supervised learning algorithms for detecting misbehavior in IoV, compares their performance, and identifies their limitations. VeReMi, a vehicle-to-everything (V2X) position forgery attack built-in simulated road traffic data set, is used to test the effectiveness of the proposed model. The performance metrics include precision-recall (PR) and receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves. The results demonstrate the effectiveness and significance of ML to detect misbehavior in IoV. The addition of plausibility checks improves the precision and recall by 5% and 2%, respectively.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9245568,IEEE Internet of Things Journal,2021
Targeted Attention Attack on Deep Learning Models in Road Sign Recognition,"Real-world traffic sign recognition is an important step toward building autonomous vehicles, most of which highly dependent on deep neural networks (DNNs). Recent studies demonstrated that DNNs are surprisingly susceptible to adversarial examples. Many attack methods have been proposed to understand and generate adversarial examples, such as gradient-based attack, score-based attack, decision-based attack, and transfer-based attacks. However, most of these algorithms are ineffective in real-world road sign attack, because 1) iteratively learning perturbations for each frame is not realistic for a fast moving car and 2) most optimization algorithms traverse all pixels equally without considering their diverse contribution. To alleviate these problems, this article proposes the targeted attention attack (TAA) method for real-world road sign attack. Specifically, we have made the following contributions: 1) we leverage the soft attention map to highlight those important pixels and skip those zero-contributed areas-this also helps to generate natural perturbations; 2) we design an efficient universal attack that optimizes a single perturbation/noise based on a set of training images under the guidance of the pretrained attention map; 3) we design a simple objective function that can be easily optimized; and 4) we evaluate the effectiveness of TAA on real-world data sets. Experimental results validate that the TAA method improves the attack successful rate (nearly 10%) and reduces the perturbation loss (about a quarter) compared with the popular RP2 method. Additionally, our TAA also provides good properties, e.g., transferability and generalization capability. We provide code and data to ensure the reproducibility: https://github.com/AdvAttack/RoadSignAttack.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9245511,IEEE Internet of Things Journal,2021
"Edge Learning With Unmanned Ground Vehicle: Joint Path, Energy, and Sample Size Planning","Edge learning (EL), which uses edge computing as a platform to execute machine learning algorithms, is able to fully exploit the massive sensing data generated by Internet of Things (IoT). However, due to the limited transmit power at IoT devices, collecting the sensing data in EL systems is a challenging task. To address this challenge, this article proposes to integrate unmanned ground vehicle (UGV) with EL. With such a scheme, the UGV could improve the communication quality by approaching various IoT devices. However, different devices may transmit different data for different machine learning jobs and a fundamental question is how to jointly plan the UGV path, the devices’ energy consumption, and the number of samples for different jobs? This article further proposes a graph-based path planning model, a network energy consumption model, and a sample size planning model that characterizes F-measure as a function of the minority class sample size. With these models, the joint path, energy and sample size planning (JPESP) problem is formulated as a large-scale mixed-integer nonlinear programming (MINLP) problem, which is nontrivial to solve due to the high-dimensional discontinuous variables related to UGV movement. To this end, it is proved that each IoT device should be served only once along the path, thus the problem dimension is significantly reduced. Furthermore, to handle the discontinuous variables, a tabu search (TS)-based algorithm is derived, which converges in expectation to the optimal solution to the JPESP problem. Simulation results under different task scenarios show that our optimization schemes outperform the fixed EL and the full path EL schemes.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9189854,IEEE Internet of Things Journal,2021
Modeling Data Redundancy and Cost-Aware Task Allocation in MEC-Enabled Internet-of-Vehicles Applications,"Multiaccess edge computing (MEC) enables autonomous vehicles to handle time-critical and data-intensive computational tasks for emerging Internet-of-Vehicles (IoV) applications via computation offloading. However, a massive amount of data generated by colocated vehicles is typically redundant, introducing a critical issue due to limited network bandwidth. Moreover, on the edge server side, these computation-intensive tasks further impose severe pressure on the resource-finite MEC server, resulting in low-performance efficiency of applications. To solve these challenges, we model the data redundancy and collaborative task computing scheme to efficiently reduce the redundant data and utilize the idle resources in nearby MEC servers. First, the data redundancy problem is formulated as a set-covering problem according to the spatiotemporal coverage of captured images. Next, we exploit the submodular optimization technique to design an efficient algorithm to minimize the number of images transferred to the MEC servers without degrading the quality of IoV applications. To facilitate the task execution in the MEC server, we then propose a collaborative task computing scheme, where an MEC server intentionally encourages nearby resource-rich MEC servers to participate in a collaborative computing group. Accordingly, a cost model is formulated as an optimization problem, the objective of which is to prompt the MEC server to judiciously allocate computing tasks to nearby MEC servers with the goal of achieving the minimal cost while the latency of tasks is guaranteed. Experimental results show that the proposed scheme can efficiently mitigate data redundancy, conserve network bandwidth consumption, and achieve the lowest cost for processing tasks.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9163316,IEEE Internet of Things Journal,2021
Dynamic Aerial Base Station Placement for Minimum-Delay Communications,"Queuing delay is of essential importance in the Internet-of-Things scenarios where the buffer sizes of devices are limited. The existing cross-layer research contributions aiming at minimizing the queuing delay usually rely on either transmit power control or dynamic spectrum allocation. Bearing in mind that the transmission throughput is dependent on the distance between the transmitter and the receiver, in this context we exploit the agility of the unmanned-aerial-vehicle (UAV)-mounted base stations (BSs) for proactively adjusting the aerial BS (ABS)’s placement in accordance with wireless teletraffic dynamics. Specifically, we formulate a minimum-delay ABS placement problem for UAV-enabled networks, subject to realistic constraints on the ABS’s battery life and velocity. Its solutions are technically realized under three different assumptions in regard to the wireless teletraffic dynamics. The backward induction technique is invoked for both the scenario where the full knowledge of the wireless teletraffic dynamics is available, and for the case where only their statistical knowledge is available. In contrast, a reinforcement learning aided approach is invoked for the case when neither the exact number of arriving packets nor that of their statistical knowledge is available. The numerical results demonstrate that our proposed algorithms are capable of improving the system’s performance compared to the benchmark schemes in terms of both the average delay and of the buffer overflow probability.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9154460,IEEE Internet of Things Journal,2021
AC4AV: A Flexible and Dynamic Access Control Framework for Connected and Autonomous Vehicles,"Sensing data plays a pivotal role in connected and autonomous vehicles (CAVs), enabling CAV to perceive surroundings. For example, malicious applications might tamper this life-critical data, resulting in erroneous driving decisions and threatening the safety of passengers. Access control, one of the promising solutions to protect data from unauthorized access, is urgently needed for vehicle sensing data. However, due to the intrinsic complexity of vehicle sensing data, including historical and real time, and access patterns of different data sources, there is currently no suitable access control framework that can systematically solve this problem; current frameworks only focus on one aspect. In this article, we propose a novel and flexible access control framework, AC4AV, which aims to support various access control models, and provide APIs for dynamically adjusting access control models and developing customized access control models, thus supporting access control research on CAV for the community. In addition, we propose a data abstraction method to clearly identify data, applications, and access operations in CAV, and therefore is easily able to configure the permits of each data and application in access control policies. We have implemented a prototype to demonstrate our architecture on NATS for real-time data and NGINX for historical data, and three access control models as built-in models. We measured the performance of our AC4AV while applying these access control models to real-time and historical data. The experimental results show that the framework has little impact on real-time data access within a tolerable range.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9169695,IEEE Internet of Things Journal,2021
Ad Hoc Vehicular Fog Enabling Cooperative Low-Latency Intrusion Detection,"Internet of Vehicles and vehicular networks have been compelling targets for malicious security attacks where several intrusion detection solutions have been proposed for protecting them. Nonetheless, their main problem lies in their heavy computation, which makes them unsuitable for next-generation artificial intelligence-powered self-driving vehicles whose computational power needs to be primarily reserved for real-time driving decisions. To address this challenge, several approaches have been lately presented to take advantage of the cloud computing for offloading intrusion detection tasks to central cloud servers, thus reducing storage and processing costs on vehicles. However, centralized cloud computing entails high latency on intrusion detection related data transmission and plays against its adoption in delay-critical intelligent applications. In this context, this article proposes a vehicular-edge computing (VEC) fog-enabled scheme allowing offloading intrusion detection tasks to federated vehicle nodes located within nearby formed ad hoc vehicular fog to be cooperatively executed with minimal latency. The problem has been formulated as a multiobjective optimization model and solved using a genetic algorithm maximizing offloading survivability in the presence of high mobility and minimizing computation execution time and energy consumption. Experiments performed on resource-constrained devices within actual ad hoc fog environment illustrate that our solution significantly reduces the execution time of the detection process while maximizing the offloading survivability under different real-life scenarios.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9138386,IEEE Internet of Things Journal,2021
Who Is in Control? Practical Physical Layer Attack and Defense for mmWave-Based Sensing in Autonomous Vehicles,"With the wide bandwidths in millimeter wave (mmWave) frequency band that results in unprecedented accuracy, mmWave sensing has become vital for many applications, especially in autonomous vehicles (AVs). In addition, mmWave sensing has superior reliability compared to other sensing counterparts such as camera and LiDAR, which is essential for safety-critical driving. Therefore, it is critical to understand the security vulnerabilities and improve the security and reliability of mmWave sensing in AVs. To this end, we perform the end-to-end security analysis of a mmWave-based sensing system in AVs, by designing and implementing practical physical layer attack and defense strategies in a state-of-the-art mmWave testbed and an AV testbed in real-world settings. Various strategies are developed to take control of the victim AV by spoofing its mmWave sensing module, including adding fake obstacles at arbitrary locations and faking the locations of existing obstacles. Five real-world attack scenarios are constructed to spoof the victim AV and force it to make dangerous driving decisions leading to a fatal crash. Field experiments are conducted to study the impact of the various attack scenarios using a Lincoln MKZ-based AV testbed, which validate that the attacker can indeed assume control of the victim AV to compromise its security and safety. To defend the attacks, we design and implement a challenge-response authentication scheme and a RF fingerprinting scheme to reliably detect aforementioned spoofing attacks.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9417240,IEEE Transactions on Information Forensics and Security,2021
Aerial Visual Perception in Smart Farming: Field Study of Wheat Yellow Rust Monitoring,"Agriculture is facing severe challenges from crop stresses, threatening its sustainable development and food security.

Cyclic Communication in Adaptive Strategies to Platooning: The Case of Synchronized Merging,"Recently proposed adaptive platooning strategies for connected automated vehicles are able to address uncertain parameters of the vehicles in the platoon (uncertain driveline time constants), but are limited to acyclic interaction like look-ahead interaction. This restrains from augmenting platooning protocols with synchronized merging maneuvers, where cyclic communication is needed and creates algebraic loops that require well posedness of the inputs. We propose an adaptive protocol for synchronized merging in the cyclic communication scenario. The protocol exploits a set of adaptive control strategies, designed to cope with uncertain driveline time constants. Well-posedness of the control inputs is proven in a distributed way (using information from neighboring vehicles) in spite of uncertainty and cyclic communication. The proposed strategy is shown in a benchmark merging scenario.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9277618,IEEE Transactions on Intelligent Vehicles,2021
"Robust Adaptive Tracking Control of Underwater Vehicles: Design, Stability Analysis, and Experiments","The unpredictable nature of the marine environment, combined with nonlinear dynamics and parameter uncertainty of underwater vehicles makes the control system design for such vehicles a challenging task. Based on these issues, hybridizing robustness and adaptation in the control system could result in more successful marine missions. This article proposes a robust adaptive control (RAC) scheme for trajectory tracking of an autonomous underwater vehicle. The proposed RAC scheme has been developed by exploiting the advantages of a robust sliding mode controller and an adaptation law. Lyapunov arguments are proposed to prove the exponential stability and finite-time convergence of the resulting closed-loop dynamics tracking error to an invariant set, S (very close to zero). Scenarios-based real-time experiments are conducted with the Leonard ROV prototype to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed RAC approach. The control design performance indices (root mean square error, integral absolute error, and integral square error) and a comparative analysis with a recent control scheme from the literature confirm the interest of the proposed RAC scheme for marine applications.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9151367,IEEE/ASME Transactions on Mechatronics,2021
Adaptive and Optimum Secret Key Establishment for Secure Vehicular Communications,"In intelligent transportation systems (ITS), communications between vehicles, i.e. vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) communications are of greatest importance to facilitate autonomous driving. The current state-of-the-art for secure data exchange in V2V communications relies on public-key cryptography (PKC) consuming significant computational and energy resources for the encryption/decryption process and large bandwidth for the key distribution. To overcome these limitations, physical-layer security (PLS) has emerged as a lightweight solution by exploiting the physical characteristics of the V2V communication channel to generate symmetric cryptographic keys. Currently, key-generation algorithms are designed via empirical parameter settings, without resulting in optimum key-generation performance. In this paper, we devise a key-generation algorithm for PLS in V2V communications by introducing a novel channel response quantisation method that results in optimum performance via analytical parameter settings. Contrary to the current state-of-the-art, the channel responses incorporate all V2V channel attributes that contribute to temporal variability, such as three dimensional (3D) scattering and scatterers' mobility. An extra functionality, namely, Perturbe-Observe (PO), is further incorporated that enables the algorithm to adapt to the inherent non-reciprocity of the V2V channel responses at the legitimate entities. Optimum performance is evidenced via maximisation of the key bit generation rate (BGR) and key entropy (H) and minimisation of the key bit mismatch rate (BMR). A new metric is further introduced, the so-called secret-bit generation rate (SBGR), as the ratio of the number of bits which are successfully used to compose keys to the total amount of channel samples. SBGR unifies BGR and BMR and is thus maximised by the proposed algorithmic process.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9346002,IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology,2021
Feasibility Study of UAV-Assisted Anti-Jamming Positioning,"As the cost and technical difficulty of jamming devices continue to decrease, jamming has become one of the major threats to positioning service. Unfortunately, most conventional wireless positioning technologies are vulnerable to jamming attacks due to inherent shortcomings like weak signal strength and unfavorable anchor geometry. Thanks to their high operational flexibility, unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) could be a promising solution to the above challenges. Therefore, in this article, we propose a UAV-assisted anti-jamming positioning system, in which multiple UAVs first utilize time-difference-of-arrival (TDoA) measurements from ground reference stations and double-response two-way ranging (DR-TWR) measurements from UAV-to-UAV links to perform self-localization as well as clock synchronization, and then act as anchor nodes to provide TDoA positioning service for ground users in the presence of jamming. To evaluate the feasibility and performance of the proposed system, we first derive the Cramér-Rao lower bound (CRLB) of UAV self-localization. Then, the impacts of UAV position uncertainty and synchronization errors caused by jamming on positioning service are modeled, and the theoretical root-mean-square error (RMSE) of user position estimate is further derived. Numerical results demonstrate that the proposed system is a promising alternative to existing positioning systems when their services are disrupted by jamming. The most notable advantage of the proposed system is that it is fully compatible with existing user equipment terminals and positioning methods.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9460757,IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology,2021
Threat Analysis for Automotive CAN Networks: A GAN Model-Based Intrusion Detection Technique,"With the rapid development of Internet of vehicles, connected vehicles, autonomous vehicles, and autonomous driving technologies, automotive Controller Area Networks (CAN) have suffered from numerous security threats. Deep learning models are the current mainstream intrusion detection techniques for threat analysis, and the state-of-the-art intrusion detection technique introduces the Generative Adversarial Networks (GAN) model to generate usable attacked samples to supplement the training samples, but it exists the limitations of rough CAN message block construction and fails to detect the data tampering threat. Based on the CAN communication matrix defined by the automotive Original Equipment Manufacturer (OEM) for a vehicle model, we propose an enhanced deep learning GAN model with elaborate CAN message blocks and the enhanced GAN discriminator. The elaborate CAN message blocks in the training samples can precisely reflect the real generated CAN message blocks in the detection phase. The GAN discriminator can detect whether each message has suffered from the data tampering threat. Experimental results illustrate that the enhanced deep learning GAN model has higher detection accuracy, recall, and F1 scores than the state-of-the-art deep learning GAN model under various attacks and threats.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9352238,IEEE Transactions on Intelligent Transportation Systems,2021
Adversarial Attack Against Urban Scene Segmentation for Autonomous Vehicles,"Understanding the surrounding environment is crucial for autonomous vehicles to make correct driving decisions. In particular, urban scene segmentation is a significant integral module commonly equipped in the perception system of autonomous vehicles to understand the real scene like a human. Any missegmentation of the driving scenario can potentially result in uncontrollable consequences such as serious accidents or the exception of the perception system. In this article, we investigate the vulnerability of the popular scene segmentation models designed with the backbones of deep neural networks (DNNs), which have been shown to be sensitive to adversarial attacks. Specifically, we propose an iterative projected gradient-based attack method that can effectively fool several DNN-based segmentation models with a remarkably higher attacking successful rate, and much smaller adversarial perturbations. Moreover, we also develop an adversarial training algorithm with min-max optimization style to enrich the robustness of the scene segmentation models. Extensive experiments on the Cityscape benchmark dataset consisting of large-scale urban scene images for autonomous vehicles demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed attack method, as well as the benefit of the adversarial training scheme for the scene segmentation models.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9200583,IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics,2021

However, as an important part of communication security, key management for FANET currently depends heavily on the base station or infrastructures, which may easily become the attack target or increase the communication overheads of drones. Therefore, we propose a blockchain-based distributed key management scheme for heterogeneous FANET in this article, based on which drones can autonomously distribute cluster keys, update their public/private key pairs, migrate between clusters, and revoke malicious UAVs in a secure way. Security analysis and performance evaluation prove that our scheme can resist against a variety of external and internal attacks, and guarantee lightweight energy consumption for ordinary drones in the network.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9311800,IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics,2021
Novel Deep Learning-Enabled LSTM Autoencoder Architecture for Discovering Anomalous Events From Intelligent Transportation Systems,"Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS), especially Autonomous Vehicles (AVs), are vulnerable to security and safety issues that threaten the lives of the people. Unlike manual vehicles, the security of communications and computing components of AVs can be compromised using advanced hacking techniques, thus barring AVs from the effective use in our routine lives. Once manual vehicles are connected to the Internet, called the Internet of Vehicles (IoVs), it would be exploited by cyber-attacks, like denial of service, sniffing, distributed denial of service, spoofing and replay attacks. In this article, we present a deep learning-based Intrusion Detection System (IDS) for ITS, in particular, to discover suspicious network activity of In-Vehicles Networks (IVN), vehicles to vehicles (V2V) communications and vehicles to infrastructure (V2I) networks. A Deep Learning architecture-based Long-Short Term Memory (LSTM) autoencoder algorithm is designed to recognize intrusive events from the central network gateways of AVs. The proposed IDS is evaluated using two benchmark datasets, i.e., the car hacking dataset for in-vehicle communications and the UNSW-NB15 dataset for external network communications.

Covert Attacks Through Adversarial Learning: Study of Lane Keeping Attacks on the Safety of Autonomous Vehicles,"Road management systems are to improve in terms of integrity, mobility, sustainability, and safety by the adoption of artificial intelligence and Internet of Things services. This article introduces the concept of covert attacks on autonomous vehicles which can jeopardize the safety of passengers. Covert attacks are designed to manipulate outputs of cyber physical systems through network channels in a way that while the changes are not easily perceptible by human beings, systems are negatively affected in the long run. We argue that future smart vehicles are vulnerable to viruses which can use adversarial learning methods to adapt themselves to hosts and remain stealth for a long period. As a case study, we design a covert attack on the lane keeping system of autonomous vehicles. In the scenario, an intelligent adversary manipulates sensor readings (lane position, curvature, etc.) in order to deceive the controller to drive the vehicle closer to the boundaries. The virus/attacker interactively learns the host vehicle behaviors in terms of lateral deviation and maneuverability and tries to increase the errors to the extent that remains unnoticeable to the driver. This process is carried out through actor-critic learning based on the Newton--Raphson method. We additionally design an intrusion detection system for such covert attacks. We use the GPS data and offline maps to reconstruct road curves and match them against readings. A simulation testbed is developed based on the map of Nurburgring-Grand Prix track to evaluate our models. Results confirm the validity and effectiveness of the proposed models.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9373943,IEEE/ASME Transactions on Mechatronics,2021

State Estimation for HALE UAVs With Deep-Learning-Aided Virtual AOA/SSA Sensors for Analytical Redundancy,"High-altitudelong-endurance (HALE) unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) are employed in a variety of fields because of their ability to fly for a long time at high altitudes, even in the stratosphere.

In this letter, a novel deep-learning-aided navigation filter is proposed, which consists of two parts: an end-to-end mapping-based synthetic sensor measurement model that utilizes long short-term memory (LSTM) networks to estimate the angle of attack (AOA) and sideslip angle (SSA) and an unscented Kalman filter for state estimation.

Intelligent Reflecting Surface and UAV Assisted Secrecy Communication in Millimeter-Wave Networks,"In this paper, we consider the secure transmission problem in an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) and intelligent reflecting surface (IRS) assisted mmWave networks in the presence of an eavesdropper. The UAV base station (UAV-BS) and IRS are deployed to overcome the blockages. Artificial noise (AN) is exploited against the eavesdropper. Aiming to maximize the secrecy rate, we jointly design the positions and beamforming of UAV-BS and IRS, where the positions here represent the deployed position of the UAV-BS and the activation position of the IRS. Meanwhile, the maximum transmits power, minimum height constraint for UAV-BS, and the legitimate receiver minimum rate constraint are required. To obtain the optimal UAV-BS position, the elevation angle-dependent probabilistic LoS air-to-ground channel is exploited in this network. To tackle the formulated non-convex problem, we divide it into two subproblems: (1) design UAV-BS and IRS positions; (2) design UAV-BS and IRS beamforming. Moreover, to reduce the complexity, we propose an ideal beamforming model to find the near-optimal positions of UAV-BS and IRS. Then, semidefinite relaxation (SDR) is utilized to cope with the highly coupled and high-dimensional variable vectors. Finally, we obtain a sub-optimal solution by an efficient and low-complexity alternating optimization algorithm. Numerical results demonstrate the improvement of secrecy rate by jointly designing the positions as well as the significant performance gains achieved by our proposed schemes over benchmark schemes.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9528924,IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology,2021
INS/Odometer Land Navigation by Accurate Measurement Modeling and Multiple-Model Adaptive Estimation,"Land vehicle navigation based on the inertial navigation system (INS) and odometers (ODs) is a classical autonomous navigation application and has been extensively studied over the past several decades. In this article, we seriously analyze the error characteristics of the OD pulses and investigate three types of OD measurement models in the INS/OD integrated system. Specifically, in the pulse velocity model, a preliminary Kalman filter is designed to obtain an accurate vehicle velocity from the accumulated pulses; the pulse increment model is accordingly obtained by integrating the pulse velocity; a new pulse accumulation model is proposed by augmenting the traveled distance into the system state. The three types of measurements, along with the nonholonomic constraint, are implemented in the standard extended Kalman filter. In view of the motion-related pulse error characteristics, the multiple model adaptive estimation (MMAE) approach is exploited to further enhance the performance. Simulations and long-distance experiments are conducted to verify the feasibility and effectiveness of the proposed methods. It is shown that the standard pulse velocity measurement achieves superior performance, whereas the accumulated pulse measurement is most favorable with the MMAE enhancement.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9149695,IEEE Transactions on Aerospace and Electronic Systems,2021
Using Eye Gaze to Enhance Generalization of Imitation Networks to Unseen Environments,"Vision-based autonomous driving through imitation learning mimics the behavior of human drivers by mapping driver view images to driving actions. This article shows that performance can be enhanced via the use of eye gaze. Previous research has shown that observing an expert's gaze patterns can be beneficial for novice human learners. We show here that neural networks can also benefit. We trained a conditional generative adversarial network to estimate human gaze maps accurately from driver-view images. We describe two approaches to integrating gaze information into imitation networks: eye gaze as an additional input and gaze modulated dropout. Both significantly enhance generalization to unseen environments in comparison with a baseline vanilla network without gaze, but gaze-modulated dropout performs better. We evaluated performance quantitatively on both single images and in closed-loop tests, showing that gaze modulated dropout yields the lowest prediction error, the highest success rate in overtaking cars, the longest distance between infractions, lowest epistemic uncertainty, and improved data efficiency. Using Grad-CAM, we show that gaze modulated dropout enables the network to concentrate on task-relevant areas of the image.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9104858,IEEE Transactions on Neural Networks and Learning Systems,2021
Dispatch of UAVs for Urban Vehicular Networks: A Deep Reinforcement Learning Approach,"Due to the dynamic nature of connectivity in terrestrial vehicular networks, it is of great benefit to deploy unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) in these networks to act as relays. As a result, a remarkable number of studies have exploited UAVs to bridge the communication gaps between terrestrial vehicles, and sometimes despite their unoptimized mobility, their restricted communication coverage, and their limited energy resources. However, it was noted that for an intermittently connected vehicular network, UAVs could not cover all sparse areas all the time. Even worse, when deploying enough UAVs to cover all these areas, the probability of inter-UAV collisions increases, and it will be complex to control their movements efficiently. Consequently, it is required to dispatch an organized and intelligent group of UAVs to perform communication relays in the long term while keeping their connectivity, minimizing their average energy consumption, and providing an efficient coverage strategy. To meet these requirements, we propose a deep reinforcement learning (DRL) framework, called DISCOUNT (Dispatch of UAVs for Urban VANETs). Extensive simulations have been conducted to evaluate the performance of the proposed framework. It has been shown that the proposed framework significantly outperforms two commonly-used baseline techniques and some reinforcement learning methods in terms of energy consumption, coverage, and routing performances.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9566766,IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology,2021
Tightly Coupled Inertial Navigation System With Signals of Opportunity Aiding,"A tightly coupled inertial navigation system (INS) aided by ambient signals of opportunity (SOPs) is developed. In this system, a navigating vehicle aids its onboard INS using pseudoranges drawn from terrestrial SOPs with unknown emitter positions and clock biases through an extended Kalman filter-based radio simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM) framework. The SOP-aided INS uses both global navigation satellite system (GNSS) and SOP pseudoranges during GNSS availability periods and switches to using SOP pseudoranges exclusively during GNSS unavailability periods. This framework is studied through numerical simulations by varying: 1) Quantity of exploited SOPs and 2) quality of SOP-equipped oscillators. It is demonstrated that the SOP-aided INS using a consumer-grade IMU produces smaller estimation uncertainties compared to a traditional tightly coupled GNSS-aided INS using a tactical-grade IMU. In the absence of GNSS signals, over the simulation finite-time horizon, the errors produced by the SOP-aided INS appear to be bounded, while the errors produced by a traditional tightly coupled GNSS-aided INS diverge unboundedly. Moreover, the article presents experimental results demonstrating an unmanned aerial vehicle using terrestrial cellular SOPs to aid its onboard consumer-grade IMU in the absence of GNSS signals. It is demonstrated that the final position error of a traditional tightly coupled GNSS-aided INS after 30 s of GNSS cutoff was 57.30 m, while the final position error of the tightly coupled SOP-aided INS was 9.59 m.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9335262,IEEE Transactions on Aerospace and Electronic Systems,2021
Attention Based Vehicle Trajectory Prediction,"Self-driving vehicles need to continuously analyse the driving scene, understand the behavior of other road users and predict their future trajectories in order to plan a safe motion and reduce their reaction time. Motivated by this idea, this paper addresses the problem of vehicle trajectory prediction over an extended horizon. On highways, human drivers continuously adapt their speed and paths according to the behavior of their neighboring vehicles. Therefore, vehicles' trajectories are very correlated and considering vehicle interactions makes motion prediction possible even before the start of a clear maneuver pattern. To this end, we introduce and analyze trajectory prediction methods based on how they model the vehicles interactions. Inspired by human reasoning, we use an attention mechanism that explicitly highlights the importance of neighboring vehicles with respect to their future states. We go beyond pairwise vehicle interactions and model higher order interactions. Moreover, the existence of different goals and driving behaviors induces multiple potential futures. We exploit a combination of global and partial attention paid to surrounding vehicles to generate different possible trajectory. Experiments on highway datasets show that the proposed model outperforms the state-of-the-art performances.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9084255,IEEE Transactions on Intelligent Vehicles,2021
In-Vehicle Infotainment Systems: Using Bayesian Networks to Model Cognitive Selection of Music Genres,"In the world of transportation, the ceaseless evolution of Information and Communication Technologies (ICT) is reflected on their migration towards In-Vehicle-Infotainment (IVI) systems, which are characterized by innovative applications and services. Such systems aim to support drivers/passengers with a varying set of functions, enhancing the quality of driving through entertainment. The goal of this study is to introduce a novel IVI cognitive functionality that automatically and dynamically proposes the optimal music genre to the drivers/users when they want to make a certain journey with their owned (or shared) vehicles. The proposed recommender functionality utilizes in an automated manner (i) drivers/users’ profile data and current situation, (ii) drivers/users’ personal preferences, (iii) external environment information obtained from sensor measurements, and (iv) previous knowledge and experience. Knowledge is obtained through the exploitation of Bayesian networking principles in combination with a practical implementation of the Naive-Bayes model. Indicative simulation results showcase the efficiency of the proposed infotainment functionality, in terms of accuracy and speed of convergence, in proactively identifying the optimal music genre and accordingly notifying the drivers/users.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9110903,IEEE Transactions on Intelligent Transportation Systems,2021
Autonomous Source Search for UAVs Using Gaussian Mixture Model-Based Infotaxis: Algorithm and Flight Experiments,"Estimating and searching source information such as the location and release rate, called a source term, have many applications across environmental, medical, and security domains. The Bayesian inference framework is used to estimate the source term. Since the gas dispersion and its measurements in a turbulent environment are highly non-Gaussian and nonlinear, the particle filter, one of sequential Monte Carlo methods, is adopted in this article. For autonomous source term search in a turbulent environment, this article presents an information-theoretic search approach that combines a widely used Infotaxis approach with the Gaussian mixture model (GMM), termed as GMM-Infotaxis. The GMM is used to determine action candidates for the next best informative sampling position in a continuous domain by appropriately clustering possible source locations obtained from the particle filter. This facilitates a better trade-off between exploitation and exploration for autonomous source search. Through the outdoor experiments, on average, the estimation errors for localization and release rate of the source are reduced 74 and 73%, respectively, while the search time step of the mobile agent is decreased around 18%. Real outdoor flight experiments using a multirotor UAV in various experimental setups show the superior performance of the proposed approach compared with the original Infotaxis method.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9492004,IEEE Transactions on Aerospace and Electronic Systems,2021
Prediction of Motion Simulator Signals Using Time-Series Neural Networks,"A motion cueing algorithm (MCA) is employed to transform the linear and angular motion signals generated from a motion simulator without violating the physical and dynamical boundaries of the motion platform. In this respect, the accurate prediction of the motion scenarios is essential to enhance the efficiency of the MCA using prepositioning or time-varying reference model predictive control. While a recent approach that utilizes a feedforward neural network (NN) to forecast the motion scenarios is useful, the feedforward NN model has only forward dynamics relating to the signals without any feedback loop. In this article, a time-delay feedforward NN, a recurrent NN, and a nonlinear autoregressive (NAR) models with three different training procedures, i.e., Levenberg–Marquardt, Bayesian regularization, and scaled conjugate gradient, are exploited to predict the motion scenarios. As the NAR model employs the historical signals as the inputs, it can predict the motion scenarios with higher accuracy rates. Based on the series of empirical evaluations, NAR trained with Levenberg–Marquardt is able to outperform the other two counterparts in producing more accurate predictions of the motion signals. The NAR method has a lower computational load as compared with that of the recurrent NN, facilitating its real-time application. In addition to the MCA, the NAR method can be employed in other areas, including autonomous vehicles and motion sickness studies. It can also be easily implemented for air, sea, and/or land vehicle simulators for training purposes in virtual reality environments.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9439050,IEEE Transactions on Aerospace and Electronic Systems,2021
Integrity for Multi-Sensor Cooperative Positioning,"A cooperative integrity monitoring (CIM) algorithm is proposed in this work. Under the CIM architecture, the algorithm can fully exploit the global navigation satellite system (GNSS) data and inter-vehicle measurements data to improve the detection and isolation of faulty measurements due to multipath or non line of sight (NLOS). Taking the advantages of cooperative scheme, a residual decomposition method is used to model the measurement errors into common and specific parts, a greedy search strategy is used to exclude the faulty measurements based on its sub-statistics. Simulation results show that CIM has better detection of GNSS fault than traditional receiver autonomous integrity monitoring (RAIM). Also, CIM is capable of detecting the faulty outliers in inter-vehicle measurements. The results indicate that CIM can be applied to many existing multi-sensor cooperative positioning algorithms.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8926518,IEEE Transactions on Intelligent Transportation Systems,2021
Intelligent Traffic Network Control in the Era of Internet of Vehicles,"In the era of internet of vehicles, both the traffic signal control and the rerouting of connected and autonomous vehicles (CAVs) are essential techniques to alleviate traffic congestion and improve traffic efficiency. However, these two schemes have been treated separately without a unified framework allowing for joint optimization in the previous studies. In the case of traffic congestion at the bottleneck intersections, either of the two schemes alone is not enough. To this end, we propose to jointly control the traffic lights and the CAVs under the reinforcement learning (RL) framework. To lower the dimensionality of this learning problem, we propose to control the route choices of the CAVs through a few common scalar parameters instead of controlling the CAVs individually. In particular, the rerouting ratios are dynamically adjusted. A model-based method is further proposed to estimate the expected travel time with reduced estimation error. We then exploit the tools from deep RL and put forth an efficient algorithm that is able to control the green time allocation of traffic signals and the rerouting of CAVs jointly. Comprehensive numerical experiments demonstrate the validity of our proposed models and show the traffic efficiency can be significantly improved with our proposed algorithm.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9516945,IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology,2021
Detecting Generalized Replay Attacks via Time-Varying Dynamic Watermarking,"Cyber-physical systems (CPS) often rely on external communication for supervisory control or sensing. Unfortunately, these communications render the system vulnerable to cyber attacks. Attacks that alter messages, such as replay attacks that record measurement signals, and then play them back to the system can cause devastating effects. Dynamic Watermarking methods, which inject a private excitation into control inputs to secure resulting measurement signals, have begun addressing the challenges of detecting these attacks, but have been restricted to linear time-invariant (LTI) systems. Though LTI models are sufficient for some applications, other CPS, such as autonomous vehicles, require more complex models. This article develops a linear time-varying (LTV) extension to previous dynamic watermarking methods by designing a matrix normalization factor to accommodate the temporal changes in the system. Implementable tests are provided with considerations for real-world systems. The proposed method is then shown to be able to detect generalized replay attacks both in theory and in simulation using an LTV vehicle model.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9187955,IEEE Transactions on Automatic Control,2021
Singularity-Free Guiding Vector Field for Robot Navigation,"In robot navigation tasks, such as unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) highway traffic monitoring, it is important for a mobile robot to follow a specified desired path. However, most of the existing path-following navigation algorithms cannot guarantee global convergence to desired paths or enable following self-intersected desired paths due to the existence of singular points where navigation algorithms return unreliable or even no solutions. One typical example arises in vector-field guided path-following (VF-PF) navigation algorithms. These algorithms are based on a vector field, and the singular points are exactly where the vector field diminishes. Conventional VF-PF algorithms generate a vector field of the same dimensions as those of the space where the desired path lives. In this article, we show that it is mathematically impossible for conventional VF-PF algorithms to achieve global convergence to desired paths that are self-intersected or even just simple closed (precisely, homeomorphic to the unit circle). Motivated by this new impossibility result, we propose a novel method to transform self-intersected or simple closed desired paths to nonself-intersected and unbounded (precisely, homeomorphic to the real line) counterparts in a higher dimensional space. Corresponding to this new desired path, we construct a singularity-free guiding vector field on a higher dimensional space. The integral curves of this new guiding vector field is thus exploited to enable global convergence to the higher dimensional desired path, and therefore the projection of the integral curves on a lower dimensional subspace converge to the physical (lower dimensional) desired path. Rigorous theoretical analysis is carried out for the theoretical results using dynamical systems theory. In addition, we show both by theoretical analysis and numerical simulations that our proposed method is an extension combining conventional VF-PF algorithms and trajectory tracking algorithms. Finally, to show the practical value of our proposed approach for complex engineering systems, we conduct outdoor experiments with a fixed-wing airplane in windy environment to follow both 2-D and 3-D desired paths.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9312173,IEEE Transactions on Robotics,2021
Multiobjective Overtaking Maneuver Planning for Autonomous Ground Vehicles,"Constrained autonomous vehicle overtaking trajectories are usually difficult to generate due to certain practical requirements and complex environmental limitations. This problem becomes more challenging when multiple contradicting objectives are required to be optimized and the on-road objects to be overtaken are irregularly placed. In this article, a novel swarm intelligence-based algorithm is proposed for producing the multiobjective optimal overtaking trajectory of autonomous ground vehicles. The proposed method solves a multiobjective optimal control model in order to optimize the maneuver time duration, the trajectory smoothness, and the vehicle visibility, while taking into account different types of mission-dependent constraints. However, one problem that could have an impact on the optimization process is the selection of algorithm control parameters. To desensitize the negative influence, a novel fuzzy adaptive strategy is proposed and embedded in the algorithm framework. This allows the optimization process to dynamically balance the local exploitation and global exploration, thereby exploring the tradeoff between objectives more effectively. The performance of using the designed fuzzy adaptive multiobjective method is analyzed and validated by executing a number of simulation studies. The results confirm the effectiveness of applying the proposed algorithm to produce multiobjective optimal overtaking trajectories for autonomous ground vehicles. Moreover, the comparison to other state-of-the-art multiobjective optimization schemes shows that the designed strategy tends to be more capable in terms of producing a set of widespread and high-quality Pareto-optimal solutions.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9025756,IEEE Transactions on Cybernetics,2021
A Homography-Based Dynamic Control Approach Applied to Station Keeping of Autonomous Underwater Vehicles Without Linear Velocity Measurements,"A homography-based dynamic control approach applied to station keeping of autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs) without relying on linear velocity measurements is proposed. The homography estimated from images of a planar target scene captured by a downward-looking camera is directly used as feedback information. The full dynamics of the AUV are exploited in a hierarchical control design with inner and outer loop architectures. Enhanced by integral compensation actions and disturbance torque estimation, the proposed controller is robust with respect to model uncertainties and unknown currents. The performance of the proposed control approach is illustrated using both comparative simulation results conducted on a realistic AUV model and experimental validations on an in-house AUV.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9235541,IEEE Transactions on Control Systems Technology,2021
Robust Orientation-Sensitive Trajectory Tracking of Underactuated Autonomous Underwater Vehicles,"Orientation-sensitive trajectory tracking (OSTT) claims that both position and orientation of the autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs) are regulated to the reference. This article addresses the OSTT controller design problem for AUVs with separate forces or torques for surge, heave, roll, and yaw, in the presence of hydrodynamic uncertainties and external disturbances. In the kinematic stage, these AUVs are capable of moving sideways by exploiting the nonzero angle of the roll, so that the position tracking can be handled while the steering tracks the referenced yaw angle. As for the kinetic stage, a robust nonsmooth controller is implemented to guarantee the exponential convergence of velocity tracking errors. Trajectories are planned for the docking task and bridge pier inspection task. It is shown that the position tracking error can converge to a neighborhood about zero, and the yaw angle tracking error converges to zero exponentially as well. The effectiveness of the proposed method is illustrated by both simulation results and experimental results.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9162488,IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics,2021

Autonomous Learning of the Robot Kinematic Model,"Robotics systems are becoming more and more autonomous and reconfigurable. In this context, the design of algorithms capable of deriving kinematics and dynamics models directly from data could be particularly useful. In this article, we present an algorithm that learns a forward kinematics model of a robot starting from a time series of visual observations. Our strategy can be applied to any robot with serial kinematics composed of revolute and prismatics joints. First, the algorithm identifies the robot kinematic structure, i.e., a high-level description of the robot geometry that defines the connections between the rigid-bodies composing the robot. Then, the algorithm derives the forward kinematics relying on a Gaussian process (GP) model. More precisely, the GP model is based on a polynomial kernel, defined exploiting the kinematic structure previously identified. The effectiveness of the proposed solution has been tested via extensive Monte Carlo simulations, as well as via experiments on a real UR10 robot.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9284446,IEEE Transactions on Robotics,2021
Quasi-LPV Interconnected Observer Design for Full Vehicle Dynamics Estimation With Hardware Experiments,"Safety systems claim an in-depth study of vehicle motion and tire-ground interaction for the design of a partially automated driving vehicle. This article addresses the quasi-linear parameter-varying Luenberger interconnected fuzzy observer to estimate both longitudinal and lateral vehicle dynamics simultaneously. In a different manner from the commonplace state of the art of vehicle state observers that consider single driving motion, the proposed approach considers the coupled dynamics with the tire-ground interaction to estimate the most important states while reducing the complexity related to the observability and conservatism. This consideration leads to a nonlinear parameter-dependent interconnected model with unmeasured premise variables. Then, the Takagi-Sugeno fuzzy form is considered to deal with the nonlinearities of the vehicle longitudinal and lateral speeds and the slip velocities as well as the steering angle. The concept of “input to state stability” is exploited using fuzzy nonquadratic Lyapunov stability arguments to guarantee the boundness of the estimation errors. A refinement has been proposed through the so-called Polya's theorem aiming to further reduce the conservativeness. Finally, performances and effectiveness of the suggested approach are evaluated through hardware experiments performed with the well-known Sherpa dynamic car simulator under real-world driving situations.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9410440,IEEE/ASME Transactions on Mechatronics,2021
"Autonomous Shuttle-as-a-Service (ASaaS): Challenges, Opportunities, and Social Implications","Providing mobility services effectively to residents and visitors is a complex socio-technical system task to city public managers. Smart mobility systems aim to support the efficient exploitation of city transport facilities and sustainable mobility within the urban environment. People need to travel quickly and conveniently between locations at different scales, ranging from a few blocks within a city to a journey across cities. At the same time, goods need to be timely delivered, considering both the users and the businesses' needs. Several cities indicated an interest in using Autonomous Vehicles (AV) for the “last-mile” mobility services in the last few years. With them, it seems to be easier to get people and goods around using fewer vehicles. In this context, Autonomous Shuttles (AS) are beginning to be thought of as a new mobility/delivery service into the city center where narrow streets are not easily served by traditional buses. They allow them to perform critical areas with minimal new infrastructure and reduce noise and pollution. The article analyses the state-of-art on autonomous shuttles by proposing four application scenarios targeting the last-mile delivery of goods, the tourist experiences, and the shared and integrated mobility. Furthermore, we contribute with the proposition of the Autonomous Shuttles-as-a service (ASaaS) concept as the key pillar for the realization of innovative and sustainable proximity mobility. Our research proposed new research challenges for ASaaS, and we discuss social implications and governance challenges that consider user engagement and sustainability. It also recommended extending new research to focus on simulation and machine learning techniques for last-mile mobility planning and explore the journeys tracking certification via artificial intelligence and blockchain-based techniques.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9210552,IEEE Transactions on Intelligent Transportation Systems,2021
"Deep Multi-Modal Object Detection and Semantic Segmentation for Autonomous Driving: Datasets, Methods, and Challenges","Recent advancements in perception for autonomous driving are driven by deep learning. In order to achieve robust and accurate scene understanding, autonomous vehicles are usually equipped with different sensors (e.g. cameras, LiDARs, Radars), and multiple sensing modalities can be fused to exploit their complementary properties. In this context, many methods have been proposed for deep multi-modal perception problems. However, there is no general guideline for network architecture design, and questions of “what to fuse”, “when to fuse”, and “how to fuse” remain open. This review paper attempts to systematically summarize methodologies and discuss challenges for deep multi-modal object detection and semantic segmentation in autonomous driving. To this end, we first provide an overview of on-board sensors on test vehicles, open datasets, and background information for object detection and semantic segmentation in autonomous driving research.

CANMatch: A Fully Automated Tool for CAN Bus Reverse Engineering Based on Frame Matching,"Controller Area Network is the most frequently used in-vehicle communication system in the automotive industry today. The communication inside the Controller Area Network (CAN) bus is typically encoded using proprietary formats in order to prevent easy access to the information exchanged on the bus. However, it is still possible to decode this information through reverse engineering, performed either manually or via automated tools. Existing automated CAN bus reverse engineering methods are still time-consuming and require some manual effort, i.e., to inject diagnostic messages in order to trigger specific responses. In this paper, we propose CANMatch – a fully automated CAN bus reverse engineering framework that does not require any manual effort and significantly decreases the execution time by exploiting the reuse of CAN frames across different vehicle models. We evaluate the proposed solution on a dataset of CAN logs, or traces, related to 479 vehicles from 29 different automotive manufacturers, demonstrating its improved performance with respect to the state of the art.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9599500,IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology,2021
On the Design of Mutual Authentication and Key Agreement Protocol in Internet of Vehicles-Enabled Intelligent Transportation System,"Internet of Vehicles (IoV), a distributed network involving connected vehicles and Vehicular Ad Hoc Networks (VANETs), allows connected vehicles to communicate with other Internet-connected entities in real time. The communications among these entities (e.g. vehicles, pedestrians, fleet management systems, and road-side infrastructure) generally take place via an open channel. In other words, such an open communication can be targeted by the adversary to eavesdrop, modify, insert fabricated (or malicious) messages, or delete any data-in-transit; thus, resulting in replay, impersonation, man-in-the-middle, privileged-insider, and other related attacks. In addition to security, anonymity and untraceability are two other important features that should be achieved in an authentication protocol. In this paper, we propose a new mutual authentication and key agreement protocol in an IoV-enabled Intelligent Transportation System (ITS). Using both formal and informal security analysis, as well as formal security verification using an automated verification tool, we show that the proposed scheme is secure against several known attacks in an IoV-enabled ITS environment. Furthermore, a detailed comparative analysis shows that the proposed scheme has low communication and computational overheads, and offers better security and functionality attributes in comparison to seven other competing schemes.

Event-Based Resilient Formation Control of Multiagent Systems,"This paper focuses on the time-varying formation tracking issue for nonlinear multiagent systems (MASs). Based on the explicit characterizations of frequency, duration, and magnitude properties for deception attacks, a hybrid framework is proposed for time-varying formation tracking of nonlinear MASs. To realize the desired formation tracking performance under deception attacks, the distributed edge-based event-triggered communication strategies are proposed with Zeno-freeness. The designed strategies are resilient to deception attacks under some appropriate assumptions, to realize a predefined formation and simultaneously track the convex combination of leaders' states. The designed control strategies render that we do not need to detect when the deception attack happens. Furthermore, the obtained results can be deduced to deal with consensus/synchronization problems, target enclosing problems for MASs with one/multiple leaders, where the communication is attacked by malicious attackers. An example of time-varying formation tracking of unmanned aerial vehicles is provided to show the effectiveness of the obtained results.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8700273,IEEE Transactions on Cybernetics,2021
Autonomous Vehicle Source Enumeration Exploiting Non-Cooperative UAV in Software Defined Internet of Vehicles,"The traffic congestion and accidents can be relieved by deploying the software defined internet of vehicles (SDN-IoV). However, the traffic of pedestrians and vehicles is particularly heavy near commercial streets and campuses. In particular scenarios, the SDN-IoV may not ensure the quality of service (QoS) for pedestrians and vehicles. In this paper, we construct a novel system architecture consisting of multiple non-cooperative unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) and a SDN-IoV. The non-cooperative UAV is equipped with an antenna array to receive the signals from the vehicles and pedestrians of SDN-IoV. In order to locate the positions of vehicles and pedestrians, two source enumeration methods are proposed in a complex SDN-IoV environment with color noise. The projection matrix of the low dimensional signal subspace is constructed by the proposed criterion based on signal subspace projection (SSP). The sequence of the projected difference values of the local covariance matrix is applied to estimate the number of vehicles and pedestrians. The eigenvalues can be grouped to construct different subspaces by the proposed eigen-subspace projection (ESP). By projecting a new covariance matrix into the eigen-subspaces, the variance of values represents the projection difference can be exploited to estimate the number of vehicles and pedestrians. Simulation results and real system test verify the validity of the two proposed methods by comparing them with the state-of-the-art methods. Both of the methods have excellent estimation performance especially in color noise.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9204806,IEEE Transactions on Intelligent Transportation Systems,2021
Vehicle Position Correction: A Vehicular Blockchain Networks-Based GPS Error Sharing Framework,"The positioning accuracy of the existing vehicular Global Positioning System (GPS) is far from sufficient to support autonomous driving and ITS applications. To remedy that, leading methods such as ranging and cooperation have improved the positioning accuracy to varying degrees, but they are still full of challenges in practical applications. Especially for cooperative positioning, in addition to the performance of methods, cooperators may provide false data due to attacks or selfishness, which can seriously affect the positioning accuracy. By fully exploiting the characteristics of blockchain and edge computing, this paper proposes a vehicular blockchain-based secure and efficient GPS positioning error evolution sharing framework, which improves vehicle positioning accuracy from ensuring security and credibility of cooperators and data. First, by analyzing the GPS error, a bridge can be established between the sensor-rich vehicles and the common vehicles to achieve cooperation by sharing the positioning error evolution at a specific time and location. Particularly, the positioning error evolution is obtained by a deep neural network (DNN)-based prediction algorithm running on the edge server. We further propose to use blockchain technology for storage and sharing the evolution of positioning errors, mainly to guarantee the security of cooperative vehicles and mobile edge computing nodes (MECNs). In addition, the corresponding smart contracts are designed to automate and efficiently perform storage and sharing tasks as well as solve inconsistencies in time scales. Extensive simulations based on actual data indicate the accuracy and security of our proposal in terms of positioning error correction and data sharing.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8949737,IEEE Transactions on Intelligent Transportation Systems,2021
Dynamic Discrete Pigeon-Inspired Optimization for Multi-UAV Cooperative Search-Attack Mission Planning,"For multiple unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) performing aerial search-attack tasks, there is a tradeoff between maximizing total benefit and minimizing consumption under the validity of constraints. This article proposes a dynamic discrete pigeon-inspired optimization algorithm to handle cooperative search-attack mission planning for UAVs, which integrates the centralized task assignment and distributed path generation aspects of the problem. Besides, a solution acceptance strategy is proposed to avoid frequent task switching. To design a reasonable objective function, the probability map is constructed and updated by Bayes formula to guide the following search motion, and a response threshold sigmoid model is adopted for target allocation during executing attack. Moreover, the flyable trajectories are generated by B-spline curves based on the simplified waypoints. Finally, numerical experiments prove that the proposed methods can provide feasible solutions for multiple UAVs considering different scenarios, such as the absence or presence of threats and insufficient resources. The results also show that the solution acceptance strategy is effective to improve performance.

State-space models (SSMs) in particular represent the system dynamics with many desirable properties, such as being able to model uncertainty in both the model and measurements, and optimal (in the Bayesian sense) recursive formulations, e.g., the Kalman filter. However, they require significant domain knowledge to derive the parametric form and considerable hand tuning to correctly set all the parameters. Data-driven techniques, e.g., recurrent neural networks, have emerged as compelling alternatives to SSMs with wide success across a number of challenging tasks, in part due to their impressive capability to extract relevant features from rich inputs. They, however, lack interpretability and robustness to unseen conditions. Thus, data-driven models are hard to be applied in safety-critical applications, such as self-driving vehicles. In this work, we present DynaNet, a hybrid deep learning and time-varying SSM, which can be trained end-to-end. Our neural Kalman dynamical model allows us to exploit the relative merits of both SSM and deep neural networks. We demonstrate its effectiveness in the estimation and prediction on a number of physically challenging tasks, including visual odometry, sensor fusion for visual-inertial navigation, and motion prediction. In addition, we show how DynaNet can indicate failures through investigation of properties, such as the rate of innovation (Kalman gain).",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9547669,IEEE Transactions on Neural Networks and Learning Systems,2021
Diffraction Signal-Based Human Recognition in Non-Line-of-Sight (NLOS) Situation for Millimeter Wave Radar,"In driver assistance or self-driving systems, millimeter-wave radar is an indispensable sensing tool because of its applicability to all weather conditions or non-line-of-sight (NLOS) sensing. This study focuses on a human recognition issue in the NLOS scenario by applying the support vector machine (SVM)-based machine learning approach to a diffraction signal.We show that there is a significant difference in diffraction signals between man-made objects (e.g., metallic cylinder and human body) even without motion.Hence, by exploiting such difference, an SVM achieves a high recognition rate, even in deeply NLOS situations. The experimental investigation, using a 24-GHz millimeter-wave radar in an anechoic chamber demonstrates that a diffraction signal-based recognition accurately classifies the real human and human mimicking man-made object, even in the NLOS scenario shielded by the parking vehicle.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9405398,IEEE Journal of Selected Topics in Applied Earth Observations and Remote Sensing,2021
DRL-GAN: Dual-Stream Representation Learning GAN for Low-Resolution Image Classification in UAV Applications,"Identifying tiny objects from extremely low-resolution (LR) unmanned-aerial-vehicle-based remote sensing images is generally considered as a very challenging task, because of very limited information in the object areas. In recent years, there have been very limited attempts to approach this problem. These attempts intend to deal with LR image classification by enhancing either the poor image quality or image representations. In this article, we argue that the performance improvement in LR image classification is affected by the inconsistency of the information loss and learning priority on low-frequency (LF) components and high-frequency (HF) components. To address this LF-HF inconsistency problem, we propose a dual-stream representation learning generative adversarial network (DRL-GAN). The core idea is to produce enhanced image representations optimal for LR recognition by simultaneously recovering the missing information in LF and HF components, respectively, under the guidance of high-resolution (HR) images. We evaluate the performance of DRL-GAN on the challenging task of LR image classification. A comparison of the experimental results on the LR benchmark, namely HRSC and CIFAR-10, and our newly collected `WIDER-SHIP' dataset demonstrates the effectiveness of our DRL-GAN, which significantly improves the classification performance, with up to 10% gain on average.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9286580,IEEE Journal of Selected Topics in Applied Earth Observations and Remote Sensing,2021
Accurate Detection and Localization of Unmanned Aerial Vehicle Swarms-Enabled Mobile Edge Computing System,"Unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) swarms-enabled mobile edge computing system can be deployed in critical industrial zones for monitoring. Meanwhile, its malicious use may bring great threat to the security, and the accurate detection, and localization are important. UAV swarms show characteristics of the high density, small radar cross section, far range, and time-varying motion, and have posed formidable challenges to the accurate detection and localization. In this article, the accurate detection and localization of UAV swarms are investigated, and an effective method is proposed based on the Dechirp-keystone transform, and frequency-selective reweighted trace minimization. It inherits high robustness of the coherent long-time integration technique and superresolution of the gridless sparse technique. Mathematical analyzes and numerical simulations validate its superiorities in accurate detection and localization of UAV swarms.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9165125,IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics,2021
Anomaly Monitoring Framework in Lane Detection With a Generative Adversarial Network,"The safety of an automated vehicle requires accurate information of surrounding conditions, because a false sensor output can lead to a fatal accident during driving. Thus, monitoring of abnormalities in every sensor is important for robust perception of the environment. Since it is difficult to obtain anomalous data, it is hard to develop a robust detection algorithm using only a relatively small number of anomalies. In this paper, we propose a data augmentation method for oversampling minority anomalies in lane detection. Using a generative adversarial network that makes the generator learn to estimate the distribution of anomalous data, it generates synthesized minority anomalies. The generated anomalies are used to train an anomaly detection network while minimizing latency for use in real situations. During training, the generated anomalies, with various mixed quality, are sampled differently according to their quality. This helps the detection network to be optimized with better quality data. Experimental result shows that when using the proposed anomaly detection framework for monitoring lane abnormality, it improves the performance by 12% when compared to the vanilla recurrent neural network.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9005205,IEEE Transactions on Intelligent Transportation Systems,2021
Distributed and Energy-Efficient Mobile Crowdsensing with Charging Stations by Deep Reinforcement Learning,"Mobile crowdsensing (MCS) represents a new sensing paradigm that utilizes the smart mobile devices to collect and share data. Traditional MCS systems mainly leverages the people carried smartphones and other wearable devices which are constrained by the limited sensing capability and battery power. With the popularity of unmanned vehicles like unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) and driverless cars, they can provide much more reliable, accurate and cost-efficient sensing services due to to their equipped more powerful sensors. In this paper, we propose a distributed control framework for energy-efficient and DIstributed VEhicle navigation with chaRging sTations, called “e-Divert”. It is a distributed multi-agent deep reinforcement learning (DRL) solution, which uses a convolutional neural network (CNN) to extract useful spatial features as the input to the actor-critic network to produce a real-time action. Also, e-Divert incorporates a distributed prioritized experience replay for better exploration and exploitation, and a long short-term memory (LSTM) enabled N-step temporal sequence modeling module. The solution fully explores the spatiotemporal nature of the considered scenario for better vehicle cooperation and competition between themselves and charging stations, to maximize the energy efficiency, data collection ratio, geographic fairness, and minimize the energy consumption simultaneously. Through extensive simulations, we find an appropriate set of hyperparameters that achieve the best performance, i.e., 5 actors in Ape-X architecture, priority exponent 0.5, and LSTM sequence length 3. Finally, we compare with four baselines including one state-of-the-art approach MADDPG. Results show that our proposed e-Divert significantly improves the energy efficiency, as compared to MADDPG, by 3.62 and 2.36 times on average when varying different numbers of vehicles and charging stations, respectively.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8821415,IEEE Transactions on Mobile Computing,2021
Stop-and-Go: Exploring Backdoor Attacks on Deep Reinforcement Learning-Based Traffic Congestion Control Systems,"Recent work has shown that the introduction of autonomous vehicles (AVs) in traffic could help reduce traffic jams. Deep reinforcement learning methods demonstrate good performance in complex control problems, including autonomous vehicle control, and have been used in state-of-the-art AV controllers. However, deep neural networks (DNNs) render automated driving vulnerable to machine learning-based attacks. In this work, we explore the backdooring/trojanning of DRL-based AV controllers. We develop a trigger design methodology that is based on well-established principles of traffic physics. The malicious actions include vehicle deceleration and acceleration to cause stop-and-go traffic waves to emerge (congestion attacks) or AV acceleration resulting in the AV crashing into the vehicle in front (insurance attack). We test our attack on single-lane and two-lane circuits. Our experimental results show that the backdoored model does not compromise normal operation performance, with the maximum decrease in cumulative rewards being 1%. Still, it can be maliciously activated to cause a crash or congestion when the corresponding triggers appear.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9541185,IEEE Transactions on Information Forensics and Security,2021
Anomaly Detection for Cooperative Adaptive Cruise Control in Autonomous Vehicles Using Statistical Learning and Kinematic Model,"This paper focuses on Cooperative Adaptive Cruise Control (CACC) in autonomous vehicles. In CACC, vehicles regulate their speed according to a preceding “leader” vehicle in the lane, forming a platoon. In a benign environment, CACC reduces fuel consumption, maximizes road capacity, and ensures traffic safety. However, CACC is vulnerable to various security threats. In this paper, we consider one of the critical threats, where the platoon leader is compromised, and forges acceleration information sent to platoon members. Such attack would lead to traffic instability and potential collisions. First, we propose information sharing in CACC model to allow vehicles and fixed infrastructure to sense and share information about platoon leaders, hence improves the reliability and supports the detection of anomalous behavior. Then, we propose a real-time anomaly detection mechanism that combines statistical learning with the physics laws of kinematics. Specifically, we propose Generalized Extreme Studentized Deviate with Sliding Chunks (GESD-SC) approach, which is applied at each vehicle in the platoon to detect anomalies in real-time based on the vehicle's own speeding decisions. Kinematic model is also utilized to detect unexpected deviations using the leader's information, communicated directly and observed by the leader's neighboring vehicle(s) and/or supporting infrastructure. Combining kinematic model with GESD-SC has shown to be effective in detecting falsification attacks in CACC. Furthermore, we analyze the time performance, and show that the proposed technique outperforms existing method in detection accuracy and processing time.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9061150,IEEE Transactions on Intelligent Transportation Systems,2021
Deep Learning Based Autonomous Vehicle Super Resolution DOA Estimation for Safety Driving,"In this paper, a novel system architecture including a massive multi-input multi-output (MIMO) or a reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS) and multiple autonomous vehicles is considered in vehicle location systems. The location parameters of autonomous vehicles can be estimated based on the deep unfolding technique, which is a recent advance of deep learning. Traditional vehicle location methods such as the global position system (GPS) can only locate the target vehicles with relatively low accuracy. The super resolution cannot be achieved when two vehicles are too close, which means that the safety incidents exist when autonomous vehicles are deployed in future intelligent transportation systems (ITS). Different from the existing massive MIMO or RIS equipped with a regular array such as uniform rectangular array (URA) and uniform circular array (UCA), we exploit a massive MIMO or a RIS equipped with a conformal array extended from traditional regular array. First, the rotation from the global coordinate system to the local coordinate system is achieved based on geometric algebra. Second, 2D-DOA estimation of autonomous vehicles is modeled as a novel block sparse recovery problem. Third, the deep network architecture SBLNet is implemented to learn the nonlinear characteristic from the DOAs of autonomous vehicles and the data received by massive MIMOs or RISs. The 2D-DOA and polarization parameters can be estimated based on SBLNet with relatively low computational complexity. Simulation results demonstrate that SBLNet performs better than the state-of-the-art methods in terms of estimation accuracy and successful probability. The SBLNet is also suitable for the practical scenario considering fast moving autonomous vehicles, while, the traditional block sparse recovery methods fail in this complex scenario.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9173575,IEEE Transactions on Intelligent Transportation Systems,2021
UAV-Assisted Data Collection With Nonorthogonal Multiple Access,"Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) facilitate information collection greatly in the Internet-of-Things (IoT) systems due to their superior flexibility and mobility. On the other hand, nonorthogonal multiple access (NOMA) is regarded as a promising technology to provide high spectral efficiency and support massive connectivity in fifth-generation networks. The integration of NOMA into UAV-assisted wireless networks shows great potential, but how to determine the user grouping and power allocation in NOMA according to the high mobility of UAV is challenging. In this article, we propose a general NOMA-enabled UAV-assisted data collection (NUDC) protocol to maximize the sum rate of a wireless sensor network (WSN), where the location of UAV, sensor grouping, and power control are jointly considered. Moreover, a joint signal-to-interference ratio (SIR) hypergraph-based grouping and power control (SHG-PC) NOMA scheme is provided to obtain the appropriate sensor grouping and the optimal power control solutions efficiently, in which the hypergraph and the greedy coloring algorithm are exploited to find out the optimized group relationships. Extensive simulation results demonstrate the efficiency of our proposed protocol.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9126800,IEEE Internet of Things Journal,2021
Efficient Resource Allocation for Multi-UAV Communication Against Adjacent and Co-Channel Interference,"Unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) swarm has emerged as a promising novel paradigm to achieve better coverage and higher capacity for future wireless network by exploiting the more favorable line-of-sight (LoS) propagation. To reap the potential gains of UAV swarm, the remote control signal sent by ground control unit (GCU) is essential, whereas the control signal quality are susceptible in practice due to the effect of the adjacent channel interference (ACI) and the external interference (EI) from radiation sources distributed across the region. To tackle these challenges, this paper considers priority-aware resource coordination in a multi-UAV communication system, where multiple UAVs are controlled by a GCU to perform certain tasks with a pre-defined trajectory. Specifically, we maximize the minimum signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR) among all the UAVs by jointly optimizing channel assignment and power allocation strategy under stringent resource availability constraints. According to the intensity of ACI, we consider the corresponding problem in two scenarios, i.e., Null-ACI and ACI systems. By virtue of the particular problem structure in Null-ACI case, we first recast the formulation into an equivalent yet more tractable form and obtain the global optimal solution via Hungarian algorithm. For general ACI systems, we develop an efficient iterative algorithm for its solution based on the alternating optimization methods. Extensive simulation results demonstrate that the proposed algorithms can significantly enhance the minimum SINR among all the UAVs and adapt the allocation of communication resources to diverse mission priority.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9512435,IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology,2021
Space Pruning Based Time Minimization in Delay Constrained Multi-Task UAV-Based Sensing,"Due to the inherent mobility and enhanced communication capability of the unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV), it is foreseen that effective UAV-based sensing schemes can achieve faster deployment and flexible observation as compared to the traditional fixed sensing systems. In many sensing applications, multiple geographically distributed tasks need to be executed while satisfying a stringent requirement on the transmission delay of the sensory data, especially for the time-critical sensing tasks, such as disaster rescue and environment monitoring. To minimize the overall mission completion time in such delay constrained multi-task UAV-based sensing applications, it is imperative to properly design the inter-task trajectory, the UAV-BS association, and the sensing order. Nonetheless, finding the optimal sensing scheme is highly non-trivial since these three sub-problems are tightly coupled and involve non-convex constraints. To overcome these challenges, firstly, a novel space pruning based trajectory search (SPTS) algorithm is proposed by exploiting the geometric characteristics of the optimal inter-task UAV trajectory, which can achieve a substantially faster convergence as compared to the Ployblock algorithm. Secondly, a novel optimal UAV-BS association (OUBA) algorithm is presented to quickly identify the best BS for each sensing task. Thirdly, by combining these two proposed algorithms with the Lin-Kernighan-Helsgaun (LKH) algorithm, a lower bound of the mission completion time can be efficiently computed and a near-optimal solution can be obtained. Numerical simulations demonstrate that significant performance improvement can be achieved by the proposed scheme.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9361388,IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology,2021
Performance Trade-Off in UAV-Aided Wireless-Powered Communication Networks via Multi-Objective Optimization,"In this paper, we study an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV)-enabled wireless powered communication network, where a UAV serves multiple energy constrained wireless sensor nodes (WSNs). In such a network, a UAV transmits wireless power to a group of WSNs which exploits the harvested power to transfer their own information towards the UAV in the uplink. For practical scenarios, a nonlinear energy harvesting saturation model is considered at WSNs. We aim to design resource allocation which maximizes the achievable sum rate in the uplink and minimizes the downlink transmit power simultaneously. The design is formulated as a multi-objective optimization problem (MOOP) which optimizes the UAV's 3D position, its transmit power, the time splitting ratio, the uplink transmission time and the beamwidth angle of the UAV. The formulated problem is a non-convex problem which is generally intractable. To address the MOOP, a weighted Tchebycheff method is proposed. The numerical results show a trade-off between the minimum power in the downlink and the maximum rate as well as energy efficiency in the uplink.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9583909,IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology,2021
A Multi-Channel MAC Protocol With Retrodirective Array Antennas in Flying Ad Hoc Networks,"In this paper, we propose a multi-channel medium access control (MMAC) protocol for the exploitation of retro-directive array antennas in Flying Ad Hoc Networks (named FA-MMAC). This FA-MMAC employs multiple channels and retro-directive array antennas to adjacent unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) to transmit simultaneously over the same channel without causing interference. The channel utilization characteristic of FA-MMAC increases the spatial reuse of channel and thus improve the system performance. The key idea is that UAVs first exchange control packets in control window to select data channels and to align beams before exchanging data packets in the data window. In this way, the hidden-terminal and deafness problems are reduced. UAVs can reserve channels and align beams through a circular directional transmission of control frames so that the protocol can take advantage of the benefits of retro-directive array antennas of spatial reuse and increased coverage without prior knowledge of the locations. We develop both antenna model and channel model for FA-MMAC protocol. Analysis and simulation results show that our proposed FA-MMAC can offer a significant performance gain for both static and mobile scenarios than the existing MMAC and 802.11-based protocols. Our findings reported in this paper provide some insights into the performance of multi-channel Flying Ad Hoc Networks which might help network researchers to contribute in the development of next generation UAVs.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9337221,IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology,2021
Softwarized Industrial Deterministic Networking Based on Unmanned Aerial Vehicles,"Guaranteeing network transmission is one of the most challenging issues in industrial informatization. In the industrial sites without proper networking infrastructure, by deploying unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV), transmission-oriented cyber-physical system (CPS) is an excellent candidate to exploit to provide transmission. In this article, we focus on establishing deterministic network transmission (DNT) using UAV-based CPS, complying with the principles in time sensitive network/deterministic networking in industrial internet. The software-defined networking (SDN) paradigm is adopted for UAVs-based CPS to achieve global optimization. First, we build the coordinate-based global topology view in the SDN controller to manage and control UAVs by integrating UAVs into the view and applying the network positioning method. Then, we introduce a hop-limited time synchronization approach to improve accuracy by reducing synchronization deviation. Last, based on the view, a geometric multipath generating method is proposed to enhance reliability by reducing the joint degree of multiple paths and facilitating convergence. The extensive simulation experiments show that our proposed UAV-CPS allows DNT to provide better reliability with reduced latency.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9234619,IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics,2021
Aerial Vehicles Tracking Using Noncoherent Crowdsourced Wireless Networks,"Air traffic management (ATM) of manned and unmanned aerial vehicles (AVs) relies critically on ubiquitous location tracking. While technologies exist for AVs to broadcast their location periodically and for airports to track and detect AVs, methods to verify the broadcast locations and complement the ATM coverage are urgently needed, addressing anti-spoofing and safe coexistence concerns. In this work, we propose an ATM solution by exploiting noncoherent crowdsourced wireless networks (CWNs) and correcting the inherent clock-synchronization problems present in such non-coordinated sensor networks. While CWNs can provide a great number of measurements for ubiquitous ATM, these are normally obtained from unsynchronized sensors. This article first presents an analysis of the effects of lack of clock synchronization in ATM with CWN and provides solutions based on the presence of few trustworthy sensors in a large non-coordinated network. Secondly, autoregressive-based and long short-term memory (LSTM)-based approaches are investigated to achieve the time synchronization needed for localization of the AVs. Finally, a combination of a multilateration (MLAT) method and a Kalman filter is employed to provide an anti-spoofing tracking solution for AVs. We demonstrate the performance advantages of our framework through a dataset collected by a real-world CWN. Our results show that the proposed framework achieves localization accuracy comparable to that acquired using only GPS-synchronized sensors and outperforms the localization accuracy obtained based on state-of-the-art CWN synchronization methods.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9512485,IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology,2021
The Outage-Free Replacement Problem in Unmanned Aerial Vehicle Base Stations,"Thanks to the feature of on-demand and flexible deployment, unmanned aerial vehicle base stations (UAV-BS) can enhance coverage and capacity beyond current 5 G cellular networks. The main challenge in deploying UAV-BS lies in the fact that the limited battery in UAB-BS cannot support long-time reliable services. Therefore, a serving UAV-BS being running out its power needs to be replaced with a new fully-charged UAV-BS. This is called UAV-BS replacement process. However, most existing UAV-BS replacement methods ignore the link outage problem during the replacement. Thus the outage-free replacement problem (OFRP) for UAV-BSs arises. We provide a method to calculate the outage probability of the UAV replacement approach. We further formulate the Outage Probability Minimization Problem (OPMP) for UAV-BS replacement. To solve this problem, a 3-Dimensional Outage-Free Replacement Approach (3D-OFRA) is presented, which exploits different heights of swapping UAV-BSs during the replacement process. More importantly, we provide the guidelines of determining the distance between two UAV-BSs to minimize the link outage possibility during the UAV-BS replacement process. Our numerical results show that with the recommended distance between two UAV-BSs based on 3D-OFRA, the outage probability of the served UEs approaches to zero, compared with 40% of the traditional direct replacement approach.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9555387,IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology,2021
Avalanche Victim Search via Robust Observers,This article deals with the problem of victim localization in avalanches by using controlled unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) equipped with an electromagnetic sensor (known as ARVA) typically adopted in these search and rescue scenarios. We show that the nominal ARVA measurement can be linearly related to a quantity that is sufficient to reconstruct the victim position. We explicitly deal with a robust scenario in which the measurement is actually perturbed by the noise that grows with the distance to the victim and propose an adaptive control scheme based on a least-square identifier and a trajectory generator whose role is both to guarantee the persistence of excitation for the identifier and to steer the ARVA receiver toward the victim. We prove that the controller ensures boundedness of trajectories and enables to localize the victim in a domain where the ARVA output is sufficiently informative. We illustrate its performance in a realistic simulation framework specifically developed with real data. The proposed approach could significantly reduce the searching time by providing an exploitable estimate before having reached the victim.,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9195790,IEEE Transactions on Control Systems Technology,2021
Autonomous Vehicle: Security by Design,"Security of (semi)-autonomous vehicles is a growing concern, first, due to the increased exposure of the functionality to potential attackers; second, due to the reliance of functionalities on diverse (semi)-autonomous systems; third, due to the interaction of a single-vehicle with myriads of other smart systems in urban traffic infrastructure. Beyond these technical issues, we argue that the security-by-design principle for smart and complex autonomous systems, such as an Autonomous Vehicle (AV) is poorly understood and rarely practiced. Unlike traditional IT systems, where the risk mitigation techniques and adversarial models are well studied and developed with security design principles such as security perimeter and defense-in-depth, the lack of such a framework for connected autonomous systems is plaguing the design and implementation of a secure AV. We attempt to identify the core issues of securing an AV. This is done methodically by developing a security-by-design framework for AV from the first principles. Subsequently, the technical challenges for AV security are identified.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9130160,IEEE Transactions on Intelligent Transportation Systems,2021
An Efficient and Secure Certificate-Based Access Control and Key Agreement Scheme for Flying Ad-Hoc Networks,"The evolution of Flying Ad-hoc Networks (FANETs) marks the paradigm shift from a single large drone to multiple small drones linked together in an ad-hoc fashion. To maintain the Quality of Service (QoS) in the multi-hop networking schema, FANETs utilize the available resources efficiently. However, due to open wireless boundary and high mobility of the drones, the FANETs are vulnerable to malicious nodes that can penetrate the network and, thus, pose serious security threats, particularly at the Medium Access Control (MAC) layer. Such susceptibility compromises the network security and privacy and harms the information exchange operation within the network. The attacker can either transmit a large number of reservation requests to waste the bandwidth, listen to the control messages, conduct power-efficient jamming or falsify the information to manipulate the network control. Therefore, secure access control and a key agreement mechanism are required. The mechanism must utilize the two phases, i.e., node authentication and key agreement, to counter the aforementioned attacks. Our contribution, in this paper, is a certificate-based access control and key agreement scheme, which is based on the technique of Hyperelliptic Curve Cryptography (HECC) and employs a collision-resistant one-way cryptographic hash function. In order to assess the viability and performance of the proposed scheme, we analyze it using formal security analysis techniques, such as the Real-Or-Random (ROR) model and Automated Validation of Internet Security Protocols and Applications (AVISPA) tool. The scheme is also evaluated using the informal security analysis technique, or the non-mathematical approach. The results obtained from both analyses affirm the superiority of our proposed scheme.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9345380,IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology,2021
Systematic Assessment of Cyber-Physical Security of Energy Management System for Connected and Automated Electric Vehicles,"In this article, a systematic assessment of cyber-physical security on the energy management system for connected and automated electric vehicles is proposed, which, to our knowledge, has not been attempted before. The generalized methodology of impact analysis of cyber attacks is developed, including novel evaluation metrics from the perspectives of steady state and transient performance of the energy management system and innovative index-based resilience and security criteria. Specifically, we propose a security criterion in terms of dynamic performance, comfortability, and energy, which are the most critical metrics to evaluate the performance of an electronic control unit (ECU). If an attack does not impact these metrics, it perhaps can be negligible. Based on the statistical results and the proposed evaluation metrics, the impact of cyber attacks on ECU is analyzed comprehensively. The conclusions can serve as guidelines for attack detection, diagnosis, and countermeasures.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9147009,IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics,2021
End-to-End Autonomous Driving Risk Analysis: A Behavioural Anomaly Detection Approach,"Autonomous vehicles (AV) have advanced considerably over the past decade and their potential to reduce road accidents is without equal. That said, the evolution towards fully automated driving will be accompanied by new and unfamiliar risks. The deployment of AVs hinges on the premise that they are considerably safer than human drivers. However, the ability of manufacturers, insurers and regulators to quantifiably demonstrate this risk reduction, relative to humans, presents a major barrier. Based on accident rates, it will likely take hundreds of millions of autonomous miles to derive statistically meaningful results. This paper addresses this issue and proposes a novel means of quantifying AV accident risks by benchmarking against a more familiar and quantifiable risk - Human Behaviour. This method is used to proactively quantify AV safety relative to human drivers. Currently, anomalous driving behaviour stems from human susceptibilities such as fatigue or aggression. We exploit this observation and explore AV driving behaviour where driving anomalies are symptoms of technology errors. The comparative behaviours of AV and safe human driving can be used to measure AV accident risk. An end-to-end model AV is simulated using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) to compare human and AV driving behaviours. Using a machine learning technique called Gaussian Processes (GP), contextual driving anomalies are detected, the frequency and severity of which are used to derive a risk score. This paper offers a starting point for addressing the challenges surrounding AV risk modelling.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9154760,IEEE Transactions on Intelligent Transportation Systems,2021
"Morphing Attack Detection-Database, Evaluation Platform, and Benchmarking","Morphing attacks have posed a severe threat to Face Recognition System (FRS). Despite the number of advancements reported in recent works, we note serious open issues such as independent benchmarking, generalizability challenges and considerations to age, gender, ethnicity that are inadequately addressed. Morphing Attack Detection (MAD) algorithms often are prone to generalization challenges as they are database dependent. The existing databases, mostly of semi-public nature, lack in diversity in terms of ethnicity, various morphing process and post-processing pipelines. Further, they do not reflect a realistic operational scenario for Automated Border Control (ABC) and do not provide a basis to test MAD on unseen data, in order to benchmark the robustness of algorithms. In this work, we present a new sequestered dataset for facilitating the advancements of MAD where the algorithms can be tested on unseen data in an effort to better generalize. The newly constructed dataset consists of facial images from 150 subjects from various ethnicities, age-groups and both genders. In order to challenge the existing MAD algorithms, the morphed images are with careful subject pre-selection created from the contributing images, and further post-processed to remove morphing artifacts. The images are also printed and scanned to remove all digital cues and to simulate a realistic challenge for MAD algorithms. Further, we present a new online evaluation platform to test algorithms on sequestered data. With the platform we can benchmark the morph detection performance and study the generalization ability. This work also presents a detailed analysis on various subsets of sequestered data and outlines open challenges for future directions in MAD research.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9246583,IEEE Transactions on Information Forensics and Security,2021
Adversarial Learning for Knowledge Adaptation From Multiple Remote Sensing Sources,"In this work, we introduce a neural architecture to unsupervised domain from multiple source domains. This architecture uses an EfficientNet as a feature extractor coupled with a set of Softmax classifiers equal to the number of source domains followed by an opportune fusion layer. To reduce the domain discrepancy between each source and target domain, we adopt a Minmax entropy approach that is based on the idea of optimizing in an adversarial manner the conditional entropy of the target samples with respect to each source classifier and minimizes it with respect to the feature extractor. As for the fusion module, we propose a weighted average fusion layer with learnable weights for aggregating the outputs of the different Softmax classifiers. Experiments on a multisource data set composed of images acquired by manned and unmanned aerial vehicles (MAVs/UAVs) over different locations are reported and discussed.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9129743,IEEE Geoscience and Remote Sensing Letters,2021
ADGAN: Protect Your Location Privacy in Camera Data of Auto-Driving Vehicles,"Computer vision and deep neural networks have been significantly promoting the development of visual perception in these years. Particularly, for autonomous vehicles, real-time image/video data is captured by onboard cameras and analyzed by computer vision techniques in many real applications. In the captured camera data, some contents can be used as auxiliary information to infer individuals' locations and trajectories, which leads to severe privacy leakage but has been rarely studied. Thus, the goal of this article is to protect individuals' location privacy by hiding side-channel information in the captured data while preserving the data utility for downstream applications. To this end, the technology of generative adversarial networks (GAN) is utilized to design two novel models, named ADGAN-I and ADGAN-II, both of which can take the original camera data as inputs and generate privacy-preserving outputs according to predefined sensitive object class. Thus, the processed camera data can defend location inference attack from adversaries in offline applications. Moreover, in ADGAN-I and ADGAN-II, the tradeoff between location privacy and data utility can be effectively balanced. Finally, the results of extensive real-data experiments validate the superiority of our proposed models over the state of the arts in utility preservation and privacy protection for autonomous vehicles' images and videos.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9234081,IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics,2021
Secure Estimation and Attack Isolation for Connected and Automated Driving in the Presence of Malicious Vehicles,"Connected and Automated Vehicles (CAVs) rely on the correctness of position and other vehicle kinematics information to fulfill various driving tasks such as vehicle following, lane change, and collision avoidance. However, a malicious vehicle may send false sensor information to the other vehicles intentionally or unintentionally, which may cause traffic inconvenience or loss of human lives. Here, we take the advantage of vehicular cloud and increase the resilience of CAVs to malicious vehicles by assuming each vehicle shares its local sensor information with other vehicles to create information redundancy on the cloud side. We exploit this redundancy and propose a sensor fusion algorithm for the vehicular cloud, capable of providing robust state estimation of all vehicles under the condition that the number of malicious information is sufficiently small. Using the proposed estimator, we provide an algorithm for isolating malicious vehicles. We use numerical examples to illustrate the effectiveness of our methods.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9485094,IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology,2021
Learning Self-Awareness for Autonomous Vehicles: Exploring Multisensory Incremental Models,"The technology for autonomous vehicles is close to replacing human drivers by artificial systems endowed with high-level decision-making capabilities. In this regard, systems must learn about the usual vehicle's behavior to predict imminent difficulties before they happen. An autonomous agent should be capable of continuously interacting with multi-modal dynamic environments while learning unseen novel concepts. Such environments are not often available to train the agent on it, so the agent should have an understanding of its own capacities and limitations. This understanding is usually called self-awareness. This paper proposes a multi-modal self-awareness modeling of signals coming from different sources. This paper shows how different machine learning techniques can be used under a generic framework to learn single modality models by using Dynamic Bayesian Networks. In the presented case, a probabilistic switching model and a bank of generative adversarial networks are employed to model a vehicle's positional and visual information respectively. Our results include experiments performed on a real vehicle, highlighting the potentiality of the proposed approach at detecting abnormalities in real scenarios.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9069298,IEEE Transactions on Intelligent Transportation Systems,2021
Provably Safe and Scalable Multivehicle Trajectory Planning,"The Hamilton–Jacobi (HJ) reachability is a promising tool for guaranteeing goal satisfaction and safety for multivehicle systems. However, a direct application of HJ reachability in most cases becomes intractable due to its exponentially scaling computational complexity with respect to the number of vehicles. In the work by Chen et al. (2018), the sequential trajectory planning (STP) method was proposed, which allows safe, multiple-vehicle trajectory planning to be done with a computation complexity that scales linearly with the number of vehicles. However, the STP computation is still not tractable for large-scale systems using the currently available tools. In this work, we introduce BEACLS, a C++-based reachability toolbox, that can leverage GPU parallelization to improve the computation speed of HJ reachability by nearly 100 times compared with the existing MATLAB implementations. We then combine BEACLS with STP for the safe, large-scale multiple-unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) planning in a city environment and a multicity environment. We show that intuitive multilane structures naturally emerge, and the size of disturbances and the vehicle density are the primary factors determining the number and width of lanes. We also extend the STP method to safely account for an adversarial intruder during trajectory planning. In the proposed formulation, the number of vehicles that need to replan is a design parameter that can be chosen based on the computational resources available during run time. The proposed formulation along with BEACLS provides both an algorithm and an efficient computational tool for resilient, large-scale multiple-vehicle trajectory planning.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9310283,IEEE Transactions on Control Systems Technology,2021
Moving Object Segmentation in 3D LiDAR Data: A Learning-Based Approach Exploiting Sequential Data,"The ability to detect and segment moving objects in a scene is essential for building consistent maps, making future state predictions, avoiding collisions, and planning. In this letter, we address the problem of moving object segmentation from 3D LiDAR scans. We propose a novel approach that pushes the current state of the art in LiDAR-only moving object segmentation forward to provide relevant information for autonomous robots and other vehicles. Instead of segmenting the point cloud semantically, i.e., predicting the semantic classes such as vehicles, pedestrians, roads, etc., our approach accurately segments the scene into moving and static objects, i.e., also distinguishing between moving cars vs. parked cars. Our proposed approach exploits sequential range images from a rotating 3D LiDAR sensor as an intermediate representation combined with a convolutional neural network and runs faster than the frame rate of the sensor. We compare our approach to several other state-of-the-art methods showing superior segmentation quality in urban environments. Additionally, we created a new benchmark for LiDAR-based moving object segmentation based on SemanticKITTI. We published it to allow other researchers to compare their approaches transparently and we furthermore published our code.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9468982,IEEE Robotics and Automation Letters,2021
Data-Driven Ambiguity Sets With Probabilistic Guarantees for Dynamic Processes,"Distributional ambiguity sets provide quantifiable ways to characterize the uncertainty about the true probability distribution of random variables of interest. This makes them a key element in data-driven robust optimization by exploiting high-confidence guarantees to hedge against uncertainty. This article explores the construction of Wasserstein ambiguity sets in dynamic scenarios, where data are collected progressively and may only reveal partial information about the unknown random variable. For random variables evolving according to known dynamics, we leverage assimilated samples to make inferences about their unknown distribution at the end of the sampling horizon. Under exact knowledge of the flow map, we provide sufficient conditions that relate the growth of the trajectories with the sampling rate to establish a reduction of the ambiguity set size as the horizon increases. Furthermore, we characterize the exploitable sample history that results in a guaranteed reduction of ambiguity sets under errors in the computation of the flow and when the dynamics is subject to bounded unknown disturbances. Our treatment deals with both full- and partial-state measurements and, in the latter case, exploits the sampled-data observability properties of linear time-varying systems under irregular sampling. Simulations on an unmanned aerial vehicle detection application show the superior performance resulting from the proposed dynamic ambiguity sets.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9157949,IEEE Transactions on Automatic Control,2021
Cooperative Intelligent Transport Systems: Choreography-Based Urban Traffic Coordination,"With the emerging connected automated vehicles, 5G and Internet of Things (IoT), vehicles and road infrastructure become connected and cooperative, enabling Cooperative Intelligent Transport Systems (C-ITS). C-ITS are transport system of systems that involves many stakeholders from different sectors. While running their own systems and providing services independently, stakeholders cooperate with each other for improving the overall transport performance such as safety, efficiency and sustainability. Massive information on road and traffic is already available and provided through standard services with different protocols. By reusing and composing the available heterogeneous services, novel value-added applications can be developed. This paper introduces a choreography-based service composition platform, i.e. the CHOReVOLUTION Integrated Development and Runtime Environment (IDRE), and it reports on how the IDRE has been successfully exploited to accelerate the reuse-based development of a choreography-based Urban Traffic Coordination (UTC) application. The UTC application takes the shape of eco-driving services that through real-time eco-route evaluation assist the drivers for the most eco-friendly and comfortable driving experience. The eco-driving services are realized through choreography and they are exploited through a mobile app for online navigation. From specification to deployment to execution, the CHOReVOLUTION IDRE has been exploited to support the realization of the UTC application by automatizing the generation of the distributed logic to properly bind, coordinate and adapt the interactions of the involved parties. The benefits brought by CHOReVOLUTION IDRE have been assessed through the evaluation of a set of Key Performance Indicators (KPIs).",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9363009,IEEE Transactions on Intelligent Transportation Systems,2021
A Secure Adaptive Control for Cooperative Driving of Autonomous Connected Vehicles in the Presence of Heterogeneous Communication Delays and Cyberattacks,"The development of autonomous connected vehicles, moving as a platoon formation, is a hot topic in the intelligent transportation system (ITS) research field. It is on the road and deployment requires the design of distributed control strategies, leveraging secure vehicular ad-hoc networks (VANETs). Indeed, wireless communication networks can be affected by various security vulnerabilities and cyberattacks leading to dangerous implications for cooperative driving safety. Control design can play an important role in providing both resilience and robustness to vehicular networks. To this aim, in this article, we tackle and solve the problem of cyber-secure tracking for a platoon that moves as a cohesive formation along a single lane undergoing different kinds of cyber threats, that is, application layer and network layer attacks, as well as network induced phenomena. The proposed cooperative approach leverages an adaptive synchronization-based control algorithm that embeds a distributed mitigation mechanism of malicious information. The closed-loop stability is analytically demonstrated by using the Lyapunov-Krasovskii theory, while its effectiveness in coping with the most relevant type of cyber threats is disclosed by using PLEXE, a high fidelity simulator which provides a realistic simulation of cooperative driving systems.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8967210,IEEE Transactions on Cybernetics,2021
Security Enhancement for Real-Time Independent In-Vehicle CAN-FD Messages in Vehicular Networks,"The rise of autonomous driving technology and the prosperity of mobile vehicular applications have brought tremendous pressure and put forward high bandwidth and low latency requirements for vehicular networks. Controller Area Network with Flexible Data-rate (CAN-FD) is a feasible choice to meet the high bandwidth and low latency requirements of in-vehicle communication of mobile vehicles. However, CAN-FD is vulnerable to masquerade attacks because it lacks necessary security authentication mechanisms and protection measures. This study presents a security enhancement technique called forward-backward exploration for independent in-vehicle CAN-FD messages while still guaranteeing each message is real-time. In the forward-backward exploration solution, a novel dual-pointer (including the forward pointer and the backward pointer) solution is proposed; the Message Authentication Code (MAC) size of each message is then dynamically adjusted by presenting the dual-pointer movement rules until the total payload no longer increases. Experimental results with real-life CAN-FD message set provided by an automaker demonstrate the effectiveness of our solution.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9362294,IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology,2021
Towards Ultra Reliable Low Latency Multipath TCP for Connected Autonomous Vehicles,"Connected Autonomous Vehicles (CAVs) are Not-So-Futuristic. CAVs will be highly dynamic by intelligently exploiting multipath communication over several radio technologies, such as high-speed WiFi and 5G and beyond networks. Yet, the likelihood of data communication loss can be very high and/, or packets arrive at the destination not in correct working order due to erratic and mixed time-varying wireless links. Furthermore, the vehicular data traffic is susceptible to loss and delay variation, which recommends the need to investigate new multipath TCP (MPTCP) protocols for ultra-reliable low latency communication (URLLC) over such heterogeneous networks while reassuring CAVs' needs. We undertake the challenge by jointly considering network coding and balanced linked adaptation for performing coupled congestion control across multiple wireless paths. Consequently, the proposed low delay MPTCP framework for connecting autonomous vehicles is efficient and intelligent by design. We conduct a rigorous convergence analysis of the MPTCP design framework. In summation, we provide a detailed mathematical study and demonstrate that the latency penalty for the URLLC-MPTCP developed over these networks becomes negligible when considering the possible benefits that multiple network convergence could offer. Our extensive emulation results demonstrate all these lucrative features of URLLC-MPTCP.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9468697,IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology,2021
Adaptive Resilient Event-Triggered Control Design of Autonomous Vehicles With an Iterative Single Critic Learning Framework,"This article investigates the adaptive resilient event-triggered control for rear-wheel-drive autonomous (RWDA) vehicles based on an iterative single critic learning framework, which can effectively balance the frequency/changes in adjusting the vehicle’s control during the running process. According to the kinematic equation of RWDA vehicles and the desired trajectory, the tracking error system during the autonomous driving process is first built, where the denial-of-service (DoS) attacking signals are injected into the networked communication and transmission. Combining the event-triggered sampling mechanism and iterative single critic learning framework, a new event-triggered condition is developed for the adaptive resilient control algorithm, and the novel utility function design is considered for driving the autonomous vehicle, where the control input can be guaranteed into an applicable saturated bound. Finally, we apply the new adaptive resilient control scheme to a case of driving the RWDA vehicles, and the simulation results illustrate the effectiveness and practicality successfully.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9346029,IEEE Transactions on Neural Networks and Learning Systems,2021
Efficient and Secured Swarm Pattern Multi-UAV Communication,"Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) or drone, is an evolving technology in today's market with an enormous number of applications. Mini UAVs are developed in order to compensate the performance constraints imposed by larger UAVs during emergency situations. Multiple mini autonomous UAVs require communication and coordination for ubiquitous coverage and relaying during deployment. Multi-UAV coordination or swarm optimization is required for reliable connectivity among UAVs, due to its high mobility and dynamic topology. In this paper, a Secured UAV (S-UAV) model is proposed which takes the location of the UAVs as inputs to form a Wireless Mesh Network (WMN) among multiple drones with the help of a centralized controller. After WMN formation, efficient communication takes place using A* search, an intelligent algorithm that finds the shortest communication path among UAVs. Further, the S-UAV model utilizes cryptographic techniques such as Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) and Blowfish to overcome the security attacks efficiently. Simulation results show that the S-UAV model offers higher throughput, reduced power consumption and guaranteed message transmission with reduced encryption and decryption time.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9437802,IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology,2021
Path Tracking Control of Autonomous Vehicles Subject to Deception Attacks via a Learning-Based Event-Triggered Mechanism,"This article investigates the problem of event-triggered secure path tracking control of autonomous ground vehicles (AGVs) under deception attacks. To relieve the burden of the shareable vehicle communication network and to improve the tracking performance in the presence of deception attacks, a learning-based event-triggered mechanism (ETM) is proposed. Different from existing ETMs, the triggering threshold of the proposed mechanism can be dynamically adjusted with conditions of the latest vehicle state. Each vehicle in this study is deemed as an agent, under which a novel control strategy is developed for these autonomous agents with deception attacks. With the assistance of Lyapunov stability theory, sufficient conditions are obtained to guarantee the stability and stabilization of the overall system. Finally, a simulation example is provided to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed theoretical results.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9354512,IEEE Transactions on Neural Networks and Learning Systems,2021
Robust Set-Invariance Based Fuzzy Output Tracking Control for Vehicle Autonomous Driving Under Uncertain Lateral Forces and Steering Constraints,"This paper is concerned with a new control method for path tracking of autonomous ground vehicles. We exploit the fuzzy model-based control framework to deal with the time-varying feature of the vehicle speed and the highly uncertain behaviors of the tire-road forces involved in the nonlinear vehicle dynamics. To avoid using costly vehicle sensors for feedback control while favoring the simplest control structure for real-time implementation, a new fuzzy static output feedback (SOF) scheme is proposed. In particular, though the robust set-invariance property and Lyapunov-based arguments, the physical constraints on the steering input saturation and the vehicle state can be taken into account in the control design to improve the driving safety and comfort. The theoretical development relies on the use of fuzzy Lyapunov functions and the non-parallel distributed compensation control concept to reduce the design conservatism. Exploiting some specific convexification techniques, the control design is reformulated as an optimization problem under linear matrix inequalities with a single line search, which are efficiently solved via semidefinite programming techniques. The proposed fuzzy path tracking controller is evaluated through various dynamic driving tests conducted with high-fidelity CarSim/Matlab co-simulations. Moreover, to emphasize the advantages of the new fuzzy SOF controller, a performance comparison with the CarSim driver model is also performed.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9204811,IEEE Transactions on Intelligent Transportation Systems,2021
Self-organized search-attack mission planning for UAV swarm based on wolf pack hunting behavior,"Cooperative search-attack is an important application of unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) swarm in military field. The coupling between path planning and task allocation, the heterogeneity of UAVs, and the dynamic nature of task environment greatly increase the complexity and difficulty of the UAV swarm cooperative search-attack mission planning problem. Inspired by the collaborative hunting behavior of wolf pack, a distributed self-organizing method for UAV swarm search-attack mission planning is proposed. First, to solve the multi-target search problem in unknown environments, a wolf scouting behavior-inspired cooperative search algorithm for UAV swarm is designed. Second, a distributed self-organizing task allocation algorithm for UAV swarm cooperative attacking of targets is proposed by analyzing the flexible labor division behavior of wolves. By abstracting the UAV as a simple artificial wolf agent, the flexible motion planning and group task coordinating for UAV swarm can be realized by self-organizing. The effectiveness of the proposed method is verified by a set of simulation experiments, the stability and scalability are evaluated, and the integrated solution for the coupled path planning and task allocation problems for the UAV swarm cooperative search-attack task can be well performed.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9679714,Journal of Systems Engineering and Electronics,2021
Vehicle Localization via Cooperative Channel Mapping,"This paper addresses vehicle positioning, a topic whose importance has risen dramatically in the context of future autonomous driving systems. While classical methods that use GPS and/or beacon signals from network infrastructure for triangulation tend to be sensitive to multi-paths and signal obstruction, our method exhibits robustness with respect to such phenomena. Our approach builds on the recently proposed Channel-SLAM method which first enabled leveraging of multi-path so as to improve (single) vehicle positioning. Here, we propose a cooperative mapping approach which builds upon the Channel-SLAM concept, referred to here as Team Channel-SLAM. Team Channel-SLAM not only exploits the stationary nature of many reflecting objects around the vehicle, but also capitalizes on the multi-vehicle nature of road traffic. The key intuition behind our method is the exploitation for the first time of the correlation between reflectors around multiple neighboring vehicles. An algorithm is derived for reflector selection and estimation, combined with a team particle filter (TPF) so as to achieve high precision simultaneous multiple vehicle positioning. We obtain large improvement over the single-vehicle positioning scenario, with gains being already noticeable for moderate vehicle densities, such as over 40% improvement for a vehicle density as low as 4 vehicles in 132 meters' length road.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9405441,IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology,2021
Fault Detection Filter and Controller Co-Design for Unmanned Surface Vehicles Under DoS Attacks,"This paper addresses the co-design problem of a fault detection filter and controller for a networked-based unmanned surface vehicle (USV) system subject to communication delays, external disturbance, faults, and aperiodic denial-of-service (DoS) jamming attacks. First, an event-triggering communication scheme is proposed to enhance the efficiency of network resource utilization while counteracting the impact of aperiodic DoS attacks on the USV control system performance. Second, an event-based switched USV control system is presented to account for the simultaneous presence of communication delays, disturbance, faults, and DoS jamming attacks. Third, by using the piecewise Lyapunov functional (PLF) approach, criteria for exponential stability analysis and co-design of a desired observer-based fault detection filter and an event-triggered controller are derived and expressed in terms of linear matrix inequalities (LMIs). Finally, the simulation results verify the effectiveness of the proposed co-design method. The results show that this method not only ensures the safe and stable operation of the USV but also reduces the amount of data transmissions.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8985406,IEEE Transactions on Intelligent Transportation Systems,2021
Hierarchical MPC for Robust Eco-Cooling of Connected and Automated Vehicles and Its Application to Electric Vehicle Battery Thermal Management,"Connected and autonomous vehicles (CAVs) have situational awareness that can be exploited for optimal power and thermal management. In this article, we develop a hierarchical model predictive control (H-MPC) strategy for eco-cooling of CAVs, which reduces energy consumption through real-time prediction and multi-timescale and multi-layer optimization. The application of the proposed H-MPC is studied for battery thermal and energy management of an electric vehicle (EV). Our H-MPC approach addresses the uncertainty in the long-term preview of the vehicle speed through robust constraint handling to prevent constraint violation. The simulation results show that compared with a conventional battery thermal management (BTM) strategy, the proposed robust H-MPC saves the battery energy by up to 5.4% under the uncertainties in the long-term vehicle speed predictions in an urban CAV operation scenario.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9027885,IEEE Transactions on Control Systems Technology,2021
Multi-Source Adversarial Sample Attack on Autonomous Vehicles,"Deep learning has an impressive performance of object detection and classification for autonomous vehicles. Nevertheless, the essential vulnerability of deep learning models to adversarial samples makes the autonomous vehicles suffer severe security and safety issues. Although a number of works have been proposed to study adversarial samples, only a few of them are designated for the scenario of autonomous vehicles. Moreover, the state-of-the-art attack models only focus on a single data source without considering the correlation among multiple data sources. To fill this blank, we propose two multi-source adversarial sample attack models, including the parallel attack model and the fusion attack model to simultaneously attack the image and LiDAR perception systems in the autonomous vehicles. In the parallel attack model, adversarial samples are generated from the original image and LiDAR data separately. In the fusion attack model, the adversarial samples of image and LiDAR can be generated from a low-dimension vector at the same time by fully exploring data correlation for data fusion and adversarial sample generation. Through comprehensive real-data experiments, we validate that our proposed models are more powerful and efficient to break down the perception systems of autonomous vehicles compared with the state-of-the-art. Furthermore, we simulate possible attack scenarios in Vehicular Ad hoc Networks (VANETs) to evaluate the attack performance of our proposed methods.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9360457,IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology,2021
An Adversarial Attack Based on Incremental Learning Techniques for Unmanned in 6G Scenes,"With the development of artificial intelligence(AI), unmanned vehicles can relieve traffic jamming and decrease the risk of traffic accidents, where deep neural networks (DNNs) play an important role and have become one of the most critical technologies. Nevertheless, DNNs are still susceptible to adversarial examples. Even worse, they also show severe performance degradation when the system needs DNNs to learn new knowledge without forgetting the old one. As unmanned vehicles travel on the road, they need to frequently learn new categories and different representations. Learning all data after the new sample arrives will expend a lot of time and space. As a result, it will affect the deployment of artificial intelligence in unmanned scenes. In recent years, it has been observed that incremental learning technology can solve the above challenges. However, previously reported works mainly focused on batch learning. It is not clear how much impact the adversarial attack will have on the deep learning model when performing incremental learning tasks. This issue exposes the hidden safety risks of unmanned driving and increases discuss opportunities. Therefore, we propose an adversarial attack based on incremental learning techniques for unmanned scenes in this paper. Specifically, it can retain information previously learned by the model. At the same time, it can renew the old model to learn new model, thereby continually adding small perturbation to legitimate examples. A couple of experiments on the Pascal VOC 2012 dataset has been conducted, and the experiment results show that the adversarial attack based on incremental learning techniques has a higher attack success rate. Further, it can improve the successful attack rate by 8.43%.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9390408,IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology,2021
S-MAPS: Scalable Mutual Authentication Protocol for Dynamic UAV Swarms,"Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) domain has seen rapid developments in recent years. UAVs have been deployed for many applications and missions like data transmission, cellular service provisioning, and computational offloading tasks etc. Yet, UAV deployment is still limited, partially owing to the security challenges it poses. UAVs are particularly vulnerable to physical capture, cloning attacks, eavesdropping, and man in the middle attacks. To address some of these security problems, this paper develops an authentication protocol for use in UAV swarms. To ensure physical security and rapid authentication, the proposed protocol uses Physical Unclonable Functions (PUFs). The protocol achieves high scalability compared to the state of the art by authenticating multiple devices at once. The proposed protocol supports dynamic topologies and multi-hop communication by using spanning tree-based traversal. It is also resistant to mobility, device tampering attack, etc., and its improvements are achieved at significantly lower communication and communication cost as compared to state-of-the-art protocols.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9551779,IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology,2021
BDFL: A Byzantine-Fault-Tolerance Decentralized Federated Learning Method for Autonomous Vehicle,"Autonomous Vehicles ($AV$s) take advantage of Machine Learning (ML) for yielding improved experiences of self-driving. However, large-scale collection of $AV$s’ data for training will inevitably result in a privacy leakage problem. Federated Learning (FL) is proposed to solve privacy leakage problems, but it is exposed to security threats such as model inversion, membership inference. Therefore, the vulnerability of the FL should be brought to the forefront when applying to $AV$s. We propose a novel Byzantine-Fault-Tolerant (BFT) decentralized FL method with privacy-preservation for $AV$s called BDFL. In this paper, a Peer-to-Peer (P2P) FL with BFT is built by extending the HydRand protocol. In order to protect their model, each $AV$ uses the Publicly Verifiable Secret Sharing(PVSS) scheme, which allows anyone to verify the correctness of encrypted shares. The evaluation results on the MNIST dataset have shown that introducing decentralized FL into $ AV$ area is feasible, and the proposed BDFL is superior to other BFT-based FL method. Furthermore, the experimental results on KITTI dataset indicate the practicality of BDFL on improving performances of multi-object recognition in $ AV$ areas. Finally, the proposed PVSS-based data privacy preservation scheme is also justified its characteristic of no side-effect on models’ parameters by the experiments on the MNIST and KITTI datasets.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9507294,IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology,2021
Privacy-Aware Autonomous Valet Parking: Towards Experience Driven Approach,"Driverless parking, an influential application of Mobility as a Service (MaaS) model, is one of the clear early benefits for autonomous vehicles, given often narrow spaces and multiple potential hazards (such as pedestrians stepping out from in between other vehicles). In recent years, real momentum has been building up for designing automated parking models for vehicles. However, in such an autonomous parking design, location privacy and identity privacy issues are always overlapping due to the improper sharing of data. Most existing studies barely investigate and poorly address such privacy issues. Motivated by this, we develop (and evaluate) an experience-driven, secure and privacy-aware framework of parking reservations for automated cars. Our idea of using differential privacy with zero-knowledge proof provides both security and privacy guarantees to users. Furthermore, the performance of the developed model is enhanced by exploiting reinforcement learning approach such that the utility of the system and the parking reservation rate can be maximized. Extensive evaluation demonstrates the superiority of the proposed model.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9141406,IEEE Transactions on Intelligent Transportation Systems,2021
Take the Field from Your Smartphone: Leveraging UAVs for Event Filming,"This paper formulates the Sport Event Filming with Connectivity Constraints (SEF-C2) problem. The SEF-C2 problem is an event coverage problem, which exploits a team of Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) over a limited field in order to track the movements of an object (e.g., of the ball) and to deliver a video stream of the events (e.g., ball passes, goals) to the spectators meeting certain timeliness and video quality criteria. Assuming a priori knowledge of the whole sequence of actions, first a novel mathematical model is introduced that determines a sequence of movements for the UAVs, such that the timeliness of the filming is maximized and the total traveled distance is minimized. Then, dynamic, artificial potential function based, distributed UAV movement schemes that have no a priori knowledge of the sequence of game actions are proposed to optimize networking performance. Extensive simulations are used to analyze the performance in terms of video transmission quality and show that the proposed schemes outperform existing schemes.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8716586,IEEE Transactions on Mobile Computing,2020
A Secure Shuffling Mechanism for White-Box Attack-Resistant Unmanned Vehicles,"Unmanned Vehicles (UVs) have been being utilized for various applications, such as surveillance, search/rescue, and monitoring. The information they transmit is critical for decision-making. However, UVs are vulnerable to white-box attacks due to improvements in reverse engineering techniques and the openness of their software. Therefore, attackers with sufficient knowledge of a target UV can steal secret information stored in the UV by exploiting its vulnerabilities. Recently, several white-box cryptography techniques have been introduced to protect secret keys from being extracted by converting them into large look-up tables. However, none of them provide approaches to securely update the look-up tables. Thus, once a remote attacker succeeds in extracting the static look-up table from a UV, he/she can use it to decrypt past/future communications or to send false information to the control station by impersonating the UV. In this paper, we propose a look-up table shuffling mechanism that supports white-box cryptography with dynamics. The mechanism makes it hard for attackers to determine the positions of the table entries, and thus to decrypt/encrypt ciphertexts/plaintexts. To show the practicality of the block cipher with our mechanism, we implemented it on a board equipped with a GPU and show its GPU-accelerated performance.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8658144,IEEE Transactions on Mobile Computing,2020
Enhancing Misbehavior Detection in 5G Vehicle-to-Vehicle Communications,"Next-generation advanced driver-assistance systems (ADAS) and cooperative adaptive cruise control (CACC) for advanced/autonomous driving are expected to increasingly use wireless connectivity such as V2V and V2I to improve the coverage, particularly in the locations where a vehicle's camera or radar is ineffective. However, using shared sensing data raises grave concerns about the truthfulness of information reported by unreliable stakeholders. For example, a transmitting vehicle may deliberately disseminate false locations to the surrounding receivers. Trusting the data, the automatic control systems in such connected receivers can be trapped to change to a wrong lane or accelerate unexpectedly, and then potentially lead to a crash. This work introduces a novel approach to support a host vehicle in verifying the motion behavior of a target vehicle and then the truthfulness of sharing data in cooperative vehicular communications. Initially, at the host vehicle, the detection system recreates the motion behavior of the target vehicle by extracting the positioning information from the V2V received messages. Furthermore, the next states of that vehicle are predicted based on the unscented Kalman filter. Unlike prior studies, the checkpoints of the predicted trajectory in the update stage are periodically corrected with a new reliable measurement source, namely 5 G V2V multi-array beamforming localization. If there is any inconsistency between the estimated position and the corresponding reported one from V2V, the target vehicle will be classified as an abnormal one. The simulation results demonstrate that our method can achieve accuracy over 0.97 in detecting abnormal reports, including those from collusion and Sybil attacks.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9007476,IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology,2020
Augmenting Vehicle Localization by Cooperative Sensing of the Driving Environment: Insight on Data Association in Urban Traffic Scenarios,"Precise vehicle positioning is a key element for the development of Cooperative Intelligent Transport Systems (C-ITS). In this context, we present a distributed processing technique to augment the performance of conventional Global Navigation Satellite Systems (GNSS) exploiting Vehicle-to-anything (V2X) communication systems. We propose a method, referred to as Implicit Cooperative Positioning with Data Association (ICP-DA), where the connected vehicles detect a set of passive features in the driving environment, solve the association task by pairing them with on-board sensor measurements and cooperatively localize the features to enhance the GNSS accuracy. We adopt a belief propagation algorithm to distribute the processing over the network, and solve both the data association and localization problems locally at vehicles. Numerical results on realistic traffic networks show that the ICP-DA method is able to significantly outperform the conventional GNSS. In particular, the analysis on a real urban road infrastructure highlights the robustness of the proposed method in real-life cases where the interactions among vehicles evolve over space and time according to traffic regulation mechanisms. Performances are investigated both in conventional traffic-light regulated scenarios and self-regulated environments (as representative of future automated driving scenarios) where vehicles autonomously cross the intersections taking gap-availability decisions for avoiding collisions. The analysis shows how the mutual coordination in platoons of vehicles eases the cooperation process and increases the positioning performance.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8848842,IEEE Transactions on Intelligent Transportation Systems,2020
An Analysis of the Tradeoff Between Fuel Consumption and Ride Comfort for the Pulse and Glide Driving Strategy,"Pulse and glide (PnG) is a driving strategy that controls vehicles in a more fuel-efficient way than driving at a constant speed does. It can be applied by the driver or, which is more likely, by an automated system with autonomy level one or higher. During the pulse phase, the vehicle is accelerated to operate the combustion engine and transmission at higher efficiency. During the following glide phase, the vehicle decelerates and the engine is decoupled from the drive train. The optimal pulse and glide strategy - as addressed in previous studies - implies high acceleration values and abrupt transitions between pulse and glide, which both degrade the ride comfort. A driveability study on PnG conducted recently identified that the acceleration, the jerk during the transitions and the duration of the glide phase have to be limited to reach the desired level of ride comfort. Thresholds have been derived for a level-eight calibration, i.e. a PnG operation that is noticeable only to skeptical customers. We use the results of the study to also provide thresholds for a level-seven calibration, i.e. a PnG operation that is noticeable to all customers without being disturbing. Subsequently, we establish a correlation between ride comfort and fuel consumption by comparing the fuel savings of three different driveability calibrations: level eight, level seven and a calibration without driveability constraints. The simulations are performed for a D-segment vehicle and two different gasoline engines. With reference to constant speed, the fuel savings of the level-seven calibration are larger than 30% below 40 km/h, decreasing gradually with increasing speed. They are around ten percent higher than those of the level-eight calibration and only a few percent lower than those of a PnG operation without driveability constraints. Hence, the level-seven calibration can nearly exploit the maximal fuel-saving potential of PnG, and, as it is not disturbing, should be considered for practical applications of PnG. The PnG strategy can be applied to any vehicle equipped with a combustion engine that features the engine-off functionality, which is the case for mild and full hybrids and for some micro hybrids. However, considering that the benefit of PnG increases with increasing engine size, the fuel saving potential of PnG is highest for micro and mild hybrids as these vehicles are commonly equipped with larger engines than full hybrids.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9093209,IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology,2020
Fog-Based Multi-Class Dispatching and Charging for Autonomous Electric Mobility On-Demand,"Despite the significant advances in vehicle automation and electrification, the next-decade aspirations for massive deployments of autonomous electric mobility on demand (AEMoD) services in big cities are still threatened by two major bottlenecks, namely, the communication/computation and charging delays. In order to target the communication/computation delays, the paper suggests the exploitation of fog-based architectures for localized AEMoD system operations. These emerging architectures are soon to become widely used, allowing for all localized operational decisions to be made with very low latency by fog controllers located close to the end applications (e.g., each city zone for AEMoD systems). As for the charging delays, an optimized multi-class charging and dispatching queuing model, with partial charging option for AEMoD vehicles is developed for each of these zones. The stability conditions of this model and the optimal number of classes are then derived. The decisions on the proportions of each class vehicles to partially/fully charge or directly serve customers are optimized to minimize the maximum and average system response times using convex optimization and Lagrangian analysis. The results show the merits of our proposed model and optimized decision scheme compared to both the always-charge and the equal-split scheme. Furthermore, the comparison of the maximum and average response time minimization results shows a very low variance in performance, which suggests by using the linear programming solution for lower complexity.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8654206,IEEE Transactions on Intelligent Transportation Systems,2020
Beyond Vision: Hidden Car Detector With On-Demand Relaying in Vehicular Communications,"Cellular Vehicle-to-Vehicle (C-V2V) communications take autonomous driving technology to the next level by allowing a Vehicular User Equipment (V-UE) to receive Cooperative Awareness Messages (CAMs) from other V-UEs, and enable the V-UE to see beyond what is detectable by vision-based sensors, thereby preventing accidents and ensuring user safety. However, there remains a fundamental limitation in the conventional CAM broadcasting since a transmitter (TX) V-UE cannot confirm whether its CAM is successfully received at other V-UEs. Without a feedback process, a significant uncertainty arises in CAM reception, posing a critical threat to user safety. To address this threat, we propose Beyond-Vision, an effective C-V2V on-demand relay system that allows CAMs that are not well received at nearby V-UEs to be better received. Through simulation that reflects realistic vehicle mobility and road environments in urban scenarios, we verify the superiority of Beyond-Vision over the conventional C-V2V, which improves performance by up to 215% in terms of message reception ratio (MRR) within a communication range under Non-Line-Of-Sight (NLOS) channels.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9252165,IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology,2020
Implementing Distributed TDMA Using Relative Distance in Vehicular Networks,"With the advent of self-driving cars, vehicular networking is gaining greater attention and the subject of extensive research. It is important to implement a more efficient and secure transportation system by enabling communication among objects on the road. Specifically, safety applications should be delivered in a reliable manner within a limited time period. Several time division multiple access (TDMA) protocols have been proposed to realize this. However, most of the existing research have proposed slot management approaches by taking into account the static topology; they have not sufficiently discussed research on “merging collision” arising from overlapping two or more collision domains due to vehicle mobility. In this study, we examine the effect of merging collision in terms of packet delivery ratio, overhead, and inter-basic safety message (inter-BSM) delay.11Delay between BSMs received in succession. To mitigate the effect of merging collision, we also propose a lightweight distributed TDMA protocol, where the order of vehicles on the road and their relative distances are exploited to determine the dedicated slot. The collision is further resolved using in-band signaling from the surrounding vehicles. Simulation studies show that the proposed scheme improves the performance of the packet delivery ratio (PDR) 10% more than the comparative protocol, and consequently achieves 97% and 95% PDRs, in highway and urban environment, respectively. Furthermore, the overhead and inter-BSM delay are substantially reduced.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9076271,IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology,2020
Probabilistic Crowd GAN: Multimodal Pedestrian Trajectory Prediction Using a Graph Vehicle-Pedestrian Attention Network,"Understanding and predicting the intention of pedestrians is essential to enable autonomous vehicles and mobile robots to navigate crowds. This problem becomes increasingly complex when we consider the uncertainty and multimodality of pedestrian motion, as well as the implicit interactions between members of a crowd, including any response to a vehicle. Our approach, Probabilistic Crowd GAN, extends recent work in trajectory prediction, combining Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) with Mixture Density Networks (MDNs) to output probabilistic multimodal predictions, from which likely modal paths are found and used for adversarial training. We also propose the use of Graph Vehicle-Pedestrian Attention Network (GVAT), which models social interactions and allows input of a shared vehicle feature, showing that inclusion of this module leads to improved trajectory prediction both with and without the presence of a vehicle. Through evaluation on various datasets, we demonstrate improvements on the existing state of the art methods for trajectory prediction and illustrate how the true multimodal and uncertain nature of crowd interactions can be directly modelled.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9123560,IEEE Robotics and Automation Letters,2020
Secrecy Performance of Terrestrial Radio Links Under Collaborative Aerial Eavesdropping,"Motivated to understand the increasingly severe threat of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) to the confidentiality of terrestrial radio links, this paper analyzes the ergodic and E-outage secrecy capacities of the links in the presence of multiple cooperative aerial eavesdroppers flying autonomously in three-dimensional (3D) spaces and exploiting selection combining (SC) or maximal ratio combining (MRC). The “cut-off” density of the eavesdroppers under which the secrecy capacities vanish is identified. By decoupling the analysis of the random trajectories from the random channel fading, closed-form approximations with almost sure convergence to the secrecy capacities are devised. The analysis is extended to study the impact of the oscillator phase noises and finite memories of the aerial eavesdroppers on the secrecy performance of the ground link. Validated by simulations, the cut-off density only depends on the range of the link in the case of SC eavesdropping, while it depends on the flight region of the eavesdroppers in the case of MRC eavesdropping.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8735776,IEEE Transactions on Information Forensics and Security,2020
Moving Horizon Estimation of Air Data Parameters for UAVs,"Local wind velocities, angle of attack, and lift coefficients of a fixed-wing unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) are estimated by fusing kinematic, aerodynamic, and stochastic wind models with data from an inertial measurement unit, a global navigation satellite system receiver, and a pitot-static tube in a moving horizon estimator.

IoT-Based Electric Vehicle State Estimation and Control Algorithms Under Cyber Attacks,"In order to provide intelligent services, the Internet-of-Things (IoT) facilitates millions of smart devices to be enabled with network connectivity to sense, collect, process, and exchange information. Based on the communication infrastructure, the IoT can allow cyber-physical devices, such as an electric vehicle, to sense, monitor, and control from the remote control center in real time. Unfortunately, the traditional communication infrastructure is vulnerable to cyber attacks, so it is a challenging task for the IoT to explore these applications. In order to overcome the problem, this article proposes an algorithm for monitoring and controlling the electric vehicle using the IoT communication network considering false data-injection attacks. First, the driverless electric vehicle with onboard vision system is represented by a state-space framework. As the electric vehicle and monitoring control center are far away, the IoT-embedded smart sensors and actuators are used to measure and control the system states. The vehicle sensing information is transmitted to the control center over an unreliable communication channel where attacks happen. Based on the mean square error principle, the optimal state estimation algorithm is derived to know and visualize the vehicle states. In order to regulate the vehicle states, the optimal control algorithm is designed based on the semidefinite programming approach. The simulation results show that the proposed algorithms are able to properly estimate and regulate the vehicle states within a short period of time.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8862884,IEEE Internet of Things Journal,2020
VeRA: A Simplified Security Risk Analysis Method for Autonomous Vehicles,"Risk analysis/assessment is an indispensable process during the design and development of Autonomous Vehicles (AVs), which is in charge of evaluating whether the risk of an attack is critical or minor. However, current risk analysis methods either are time-consuming or not suitable for Connected and Autonomous Vehicles (CAVs). In this paper, an efficient security risk analysis method, Vehicles Risk Analysis (VeRA), is proposed, fitting for evaluating the risks of attacks in the context of AV and CAVs. VeRA firstly considers the human capabilities and vehicle automation level to conduct a security risk analysis. Meanwhile, compared to the benchmark (i.e., SAE J3061), VeRA uses a simplified analysis process and fewer factors, significantly reducing the required analysis time without affecting analysis accuracy. Moreover, based on VeRA, a simple but efficient mathematical model is established to assess the risk value by considering the attack probability, severity and human control, avoiding the tedious process of looking up tables in previous methods. A case study on a general AV model shows that VeRA not only captures the critical attacks as accurate as other methods, but also analyzes the changes of human controllability with the vehicle's automation level. The performance compared to other available methods shows that VeRA can obtain the same analysis results by using around 43% less time than the benchmark.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9140383,IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology,2020
Cloud Computing-Based Analyses to Predict Vehicle Driving Shockwave for Active Safe Driving in Intelligent Transportation System,"In the cloud computing era, the analyses of various types of big data gathered from the Internet of Vehicles, the Internet of Things, and smart sensors/devices achieve convenient services. Some famous applications include vehicle traffic loading on roads (from Google MAP), video sharing for fans group (from Facebook or Youtube), and so on. However, to achieve real-time active safe driving (RT-ASD) under unstable driving in high-threat areas on roads becomes an open issue in cloud computing-based intelligent transportation system. This paper proposes a predictive backward shockwave analysis approach (PSA) to achieve the RT-ASD based on the analyses of macroscopic traffic shockwave (PSA_MA) and microscopic car-following (PSA_mi). The PSA contributes in several aspects to active safe driving: 1) predicting and analyzing high threat of backward shockwaves from the gathered big data of the driving state information vehicles; 2) informing the analyzed threat messages to the vehicles in high-threat areas via the 3-Tier hierarchical cloud computing mechanism; 3) reducing the driving threat certainly; and 4) PSA_MA and PSA_mi can be applied for achieving active safe driving in autonomous self-driving vehicles and human-driving vehicles. The numerical results show that the PSA outperforms in approaches to relative error rate prediction, the accuracy of the backward shockwave determination, average vehicle velocity, average travel time, number of goodput vehicles, time-to-collision, and distance-to-collision.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8671516,IEEE Transactions on Intelligent Transportation Systems,2020
Android HIV: A Study of Repackaging Malware for Evading Machine-Learning Detection,"Machine learning-based solutions have been successfully employed for the automatic detection of malware on Android. However, machine learning models lack robustness to adversarial examples, which are crafted by adding carefully chosen perturbations to the normal inputs. So far, the adversarial examples can only deceive detectors that rely on syntactic features (e.g., requested permissions, API calls, etc.), and the perturbations can only be implemented by simply modifying application’s manifest. While recent Android malware detectors rely more on semantic features from Dalvik bytecode rather than manifest, existing attacking/defending methods are no longer effective. In this paper, we introduce a new attacking method that generates adversarial examples of Android malware and evades being detected by the current models. To this end, we propose a method of applying optimal perturbations onto Android APK that can successfully deceive the machine learning detectors. We develop an automated tool to generate the adversarial examples without human intervention. In contrast to existing works, the adversarial examples crafted by our method can also deceive recent machine learning-based detectors that rely on semantic features such as control-flow-graph. The perturbations can also be implemented directly onto APK’s Dalvik bytecode rather than Android manifest to evade from recent detectors. We demonstrate our attack on two state-of-the-art Android malware detection schemes, MaMaDroid and Drebin. Our results show that the malware detection rates decreased from 96% to 0% in MaMaDroid, and from 97% to 0% in Drebin, with just a small number of codes to be inserted into the APK.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8782574,IEEE Transactions on Information Forensics and Security,2020
Exploiting Redundancy for Reliability Analysis of Sensor Perception in Automated Driving Vehicles,"For automated driving, the perception provided by lidar, radar, and camera sensors is safety-critical. Validating sensor perception reliability with standard empirical tests is impractical, owing to the large required test effort and the need for a reference truth to identify sensor errors. To address these challenges, we investigate the possibility of estimating sensor perception reliability without a reference truth. In particular, we propose a framework to learn sensor perception reliability solely by exploiting sensor redundancies. We formulate a likelihood function for redundant binary sensor data without a reference truth and propose a Gaussian copula to model dependent sensor errors. Synthetic numerical experiments show that under an adequate dependence model, correct sensor perception reliabilities can be estimated without a reference truth. Because the selection of an adequate dependence model is challenging without a reference truth, we also investigate how inadequate dependence models influence the estimation. The proposed framework is a step toward the validation of sensor perception reliability because it could enable the learning of reliabilities from a fleet of driver-controlled vehicles equipped with series sensors.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8886711,IEEE Transactions on Intelligent Transportation Systems,2020
A Machine Learning Approach for Estimating Air Data Parameters of Small Fixed-Wing UAVs Using Distributed Pressure Sensors,"This paper presents a method for estimating the air data parameters for a small fixed-wing, unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) using an arrangement of low-cost Micro-electromechinal systems (MEMS)-based pressure sensors embedded in the surface of the UAV. The pressure measurements are used in a machine learning (ML) model to estimate the angle of attack, sideslip angle, and airspeed. Two ML algorithms based on artificial neural networks (NNs) and linear regression (LR) are implemented, tested, and assessed using data collected from wind tunnel experiments and a flight test, and the results are compared to a benchmark flight test. Training the ML algorithms using wind tunnel data was found to introduce several potential error sources that need to be addressed in order to provide accurate estimation on the benchmark flight test, whereas training the algorithms using flight data provides lower estimation RMSE values. The performance of the NN structures has been found to slightly outperform the LR algorithms in estimation accuracy. Finally, results from using different sensor configurations and a pseudo-Reynolds number are presented in an effort to evaluate the influence of sensor number and placement on the accuracy of the method.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8859289,IEEE Transactions on Aerospace and Electronic Systems,2020
An Artificially Weighted Spanning Tree Coverage Algorithm for Decentralized Flying Robots,"In this article, an artificially weighted spanning tree coverage (AWSTC) algorithm is proposed for the distributed path planning of multiple flying robots. To balance well the efficiency, redundancy, and robustness in the cooperative coverage problem, each robot simultaneously constructs its spanning tree, which grows toward the center of inertia of the uncovered area and keeps away from the trees of its partners. Based on this, each robot covers a concerned area with almost equal trajectory length and computational burden. To guarantee dynamical consistency, a trajectory-smoothing method is developed utilizing Bézier curve transition. As transition in the spanning tree path planning is always conducted around the corner with right angle, geometric and velocity profiles of this kind of transition can be preevaluated as a basic component and then connected to establish more complex real-time trajectories according to the constructed spanning trees. Numerical evaluations and real-time flight experiments are carried out at last. Results demonstrate that the proposed strategy can generate a smooth trajectory for an area coverage problem while ensuring efficiency and robustness. In particular, the efficiency of the proposed algorithm is quite close to the typical centralized spanning tree coverage (STC) algorithm, while ensuring the fulfillment of the coverage task regardless of any breakdown in the individual robot. Note to Practitioners—In applications such as infrastructure inspection and plant protection, the concerned area or terrain is required to be fully covered with the smallest possible time consumption. In view of these real-world requirements, multiple unmanned systems with proper path planning provide a promising solution that can significantly enhance the efficiency as well as the robustness, compared with a single-robot system. Especially, centralized STC algorithms, concerning the computation efficiency and trajectory redundancy of multiple unmanned systems, demonstrate satisfactory effectiveness, and thereby receive a lot of attention. Unfortunately, most of the STC algorithms are proposed in a centralized control framework. Therefore, it is worth to study its decentralized version that could exploit the advantages of the distributed multiple robots. With this consideration, a decentralized AWSTC algorithm is proposed in this article. This spanning tree-based strategy artificially assigns priority weight for each cell, with respect to each individual robot, in the concerned area. With specially designed weight assignment, each robot tends to construct a spanning tree with cells that are uncovered but keep away from the trees of its partners. Based on this, the task burden as well as computational cost of each robot are almost equal. To improve the real-time performance, a Bézier transition trajectory-generation method is also used. With proper parameter selection, robots can generate smooth trajectory with constant velocity in real-time missions. Numerical evaluations and experiments with real-time flight demonstrate the effectiveness of this methodology.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9017928,IEEE Transactions on Automation Science and Engineering,2020
Joint Fleet Sizing and Charging System Planning for Autonomous Electric Vehicles,"This paper studies the joint fleet sizing and charging system planning problem for a company operating a fleet of autonomous electric vehicles (AEVs) for passenger and goods transportation. Most of the relevant published papers focus on intracity scenarios and adopt heuristic approaches, e.g., agent based simulation, which do not guarantee optimality. In contrast, we propose a mixed integer linear programming model for intercity scenarios. This model incorporates comprehensive considerations of 1) limited AEV driving range; 2) optimal AEV routing and relocating operations; 3) time-varying origin-destination transport demands; and 4) differentiated operation cost structure of passenger and goods transportation. The proposed model can be computational expensive when the scale of the transportation network is large. We then exploit the structure of this program to expedite its solution. Numerical experiments are conducted to validate the proposed method. Our experimental results show that AEVs in passenger and goods transportation have remarkable planning and operation differences. We also demonstrate that intelligent routing and relocating operations, charging system and vehicle parameters, e.g., charging power, battery capacity, driving speed etc., can significantly affect the economic efficiency and the planning results of an AEV fleet.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8880643,IEEE Transactions on Intelligent Transportation Systems,2020
Gaussian Process Online Learning With a Sparse Data Stream,"Gaussian processes (GPs) have been exploited for various applications even including online learning. To learn time-varying hyperparameters from an information-limited sparse data stream, we consider the infinite-horizon Gaussian process (IHGP) with a low computational complexity. For example, the IHGP framework could provide efficient GP online learning with a sparse data stream in mobile devices. However, we show that the originally proposed IHGP has difficulty in learning time-varying hyperparameters online from the sparse data stream due to the numerically approximated gradient of the marginal likelihood function. In this paper, we show how to extend the IHGP in order to learn time-varying hyperparameters using a sparse and non-stationary data stream. In particular, our solution approach offers the exact gradient as the solution of a Lyapunov equation. Therefore, our approach achieves better performance with a sparse data stream while still keeping the computational complexity low. Finally, we present the comparison results to demonstrate that our approach outperforms the originally proposed IHGP on practical applications with sparse data streams. To demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach, we consider a multi-rate sensor fusion or an interpolation problem where slow vision systems need to be combined with other fast sensory units for feedback control in the field of autonomous driving. In particular, we apply our approach to vehicle lateral position error estimation together with a deep learning model for autonomous driving using non-stationary lateral position error signals in a model-free and data-driven fashion.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9145692,IEEE Robotics and Automation Letters,2020
Multimodal Multispectral Imaging System for Small UAVs,"Multispectral imaging is an attractive sensing modality for small unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) in numerous applications. The most compact spectral camera architecture is based on spectral filters in the focal plane. Vehicle movement can be used to scan the scene using multiple bandpass filters arranged perpendicular to the flight direction. With known camera trajectory and scene structure, it is possible to assemble a spectral image in software. In this letter, we demonstrate the feasibility of a novel concept for low-cost wide area multispectral imaging with integrated spectral consistency testing. Six bandpass filters are arranged in a periodically repeating pattern. Since different bands are recorded at different times and in different viewing directions, there is a risk of obtaining spectral artifacts in the image. We exploit the repeated sampling of bands to enable spectral consistency testing, which leads to significantly improved spectral integrity. In addition, an unfiltered region permits conventional 2D video imaging that can be used for image-based navigation and 3D reconstruction. The proposed multimodal imaging system was tested on a UAV in a realistic experiment. The results demonstrate that spectral reconstruction and consistency testing can be performed by image processing alone, based on visual simultaneous localization and mapping (VSLAM).",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8962177,IEEE Robotics and Automation Letters,2020
A Trust-Based Team Formation Framework for Mobile Intelligence in Smart Factories,"In Smart Factories, automated guided vehicles (AGVs) accomplish heterogeneous tasks as moving objects, restoring connectivity, or performing different manufacturing activities into production lines. These kinds of devices combine several capabilities, as artificial intelligence (visual and speech recognition, automatic fault detecting, proactive behavior) and mobility, into the so-called “mobile intelligence.” A typical scenario is represented by a workshop with a large number of mobile intelligent devices with associated agents, mutually interacting on their behalf. Here, to reach a given target by contemporary satisfying some basic requirements like effectiveness and efficiency, it is often necessary to organize ad hoc teams of free-moving vehicles, sensors, and smart devices. Therefore, a specific issue is the adequate representation of the reciprocal agent/device trustworthiness for advantaging such team formation processes within a smart factory environment. To this end, in this article, first, we define a trust measure based on reliability and reputation of AGVs, which are computed based on the feedbacks released for the AGVs activities in the factory; second, we design a trust framework exploiting the defined measures to support the formation of virtual, temporary, and trust-based teams of mobile intelligent devices; and third, we present a set of experimental results highlighting that the proposed trust framework can improve the workshop performance in terms of effectiveness and efficiency.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8950429,IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics,2020
Protecting an Autonomous Delivery Agent Against a Vision-Guided Adversary: Algorithms and Experimental Results,"Safety considerations call for deployment of autonomous ground vehicles in defense and high risk zones for transport of goods from one point to another. Such vehicles face the threat of an intelligent autonomous adversary that may disrupt the transfer of material. This article investigates the challenges involved in autonomous protection of a delivery agent, via a land-based rescue agent, before interception of the delivery agent by the adversary occurs. In particular, we study how effectively an adversary equipped with a vision sensor can be handled by an autonomous rescue agent operating without vision support and relying only on wireless communication with the delivery agent. Taking capabilities and weights of the three vehicles into account, the delivery agent is assumed to be the slowest while the adversary operates at the highest speed among the three vehicles. A geometric framework based on Apollonius circles is proposed to analyze the interaction between the delivery and rescue agents. The adversary's speed and its moves (based on the direction of the delivery agent) are taken into account, along with the Apollonius circles for the rescue-delivery agent pair, to determine the possibility of capture. Regions in the plane where the delivery and rescue agents can meet, prior to a capture by the adversary, are obtained to compute safe regions for the delivery agent. Algorithms adopted by the delivery agent, rescue agent, and the adversary are described. We, then, explore the challenges in rescue of multiple delivery agents from a vision-guided adversary by introducing additional rescue agents. In particular, we study protection of $k$ delivery agents (from an adversary) via $k$ rescue agents. Algorithms to compute 1) multiple meeting points, one each for a delivery agent-rescue agent pair and 2) the strategy of the adversary to capture any one of the $k$ delivery agents are presented. Experiments with multiple agents show that the delivery and rescue agents can execute their strategies using simply low-end microcontrollers without external memory.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8930280,IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics,2020
Impacts of Constrained Sensing and Communication Based Attacks on Vehicular Platoons,"Vehicular platooning promises to bring a faster, safer, and more efficient transportation. Automated platooned vehicles will rely on information obtained from inter-vehicle communication channels and on-board sensors to make driving decisions and achieve platooning. However, such reliance creates an opportunity for safety violating attacks intended to disrupt the platoon formation and cause accidents. In this work, we investigate more realistic attacks mounted against the communication and sensing functionalities of platooned vehicles. More specifically, we are interested in approximating the set of final unsafe states, that can be reached by mounting realistically constrained attacks capable of introducing delay and injecting false-data against the aforementioned functionalities. For that purpose, we will use reachability analysis which enables us to realize whether it is possible to drive the platoon from initial to final states given performance and physical bounds. Our results suggest that these two types of attack are able to steer the platoon towards dangerous states and generate impacts on passengers' safety by causing crashes at high speeds.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9037093,IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology,2020
Unified Biometric Privacy Preserving Three-Factor Authentication and Key Agreement for Cloud-Assisted Autonomous Vehicles,"Autonomous vehicles (AVs) are increasingly common, although there remain a number of limitations that need to be addressed in order for their deployment to be more widespread. For example, to mitigate the failure of self-driving functions in AVs, introducing the remote control capability (which allows a human driver to operate the vehicle remotely in certain circumferences) is one of several countermeasures proposed. However, the remote control capability breaks the isolation of onboard driving systems and can be potentially exploited by malicious actors to take over control of the AVs; thus, risking the safety of the passengers and pedestrians (e.g., AVs are remotely taken over by terrorist groups to carry out coordinated attacks in places of mass gatherings). Therefore, security is a key, mandatory feature in the design of AVs. In this paper, we propose a cloud-centric three-factor authentication and key agreement protocol (CT-AKA) integrating passwords, biometrics and smart cards to ensure secure access to both cloud and AVs. Three typical biometric encryption approaches, including fuzzy vault, fuzzy commitment, and fuzzy extractor, are unified to achieve three-factor authentication without leaking the biometric privacy of users. Moreover, two session keys are negotiated in our protocol, namely: one between the user and AV to support secure remote control of the AV, and the other is negotiated between the mobile device and the cloud to introduce resilience to the compromise of ephemeral security parameters to ensure cloud data access security with a high security guarantee. Finally, we formally verify the security properties and evaluate the efficiency of CT-AKA, whose findings demonstrate that the protocol achieves high security strength with reasonable computation and communication costs.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8979385,IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology,2020
Optimal Time-Consuming Path Planning for Autonomous Underwater Vehicles Based on a Dynamic Neural Network Model in Ocean Current Environments,"Path planning is a prerequisite for autonomous underwater vehicles to perform tasks autonomously. Many shortest distance algorithms are applied, and ocean currents are ignored to plan a short path in distance, which is usually time and energy consuming. In fact, the favourable currents can be exploited while avoiding the opposite ocean flows. Based on the bioinspired neural network architecture, this paper proposes a novel dynamic neural network model to plan the time-saving path in ocean current environments. After that, the path is smoothed by the B-spline algorithm. Analysis of the model shows that it can find out the minimum time path. Many simulations have also been introduced to test the effectiveness of the proposed model, showing good results. The dynamic neural network model has no learning procedure and can run in parallel. It has the advantages of loose parameter restrictions and wide spreading of neural activities. In addition, it has also been proven to be suitable for strong ocean currents.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9244620,IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology,2020
A Game Theoretic Scheme for Collaborative Vehicular Task Offloading in 5G HetNets,"The 5G heterogeneous networks (HetNets) are capable of providing real-time computing services for autonomous vehicles (AVs) by deploying edge computing devices (ECDs) at macro cell base stations (MCBSs) and small cell base stations (SCBSs). With the imbalanced distribution and fast moving AVs contending intensely for computing services, how to efficiently exploit cooperations among participants in 5G HetNets to improve the service performance is therefore challenging. In this paper, we develop a game theoretic scheme for collaborative vehicular task offloading to facilitate the computing services in 5G HetNets. Specifically, we propose a two-stage vehicular task offloading mechanism to promote the cooperation among participants with the target of improving the task completion rate and the utilities of the participants, where the mechanism jointly considers the network architecture of the HetNets, the imbalanced distribution of AVs and the reuse of task results. In the first stage, an auction model is designed to help the MCBS select the optimal SCBS to execute the offloaded task based on the requirement of the task and the available computing resources of SCBSs. According to the task execution cost declared by the selected SCBS, the MCBS then bargains with the AV for the agreement of the task offloading service to maximize their utilities in the second stage. Using simulations, we show that the proposed collaborative task offloading scheme can achieve a higher task completion rate for the task offloading service and bring higher utilities to all participants than conventional schemes.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9275320,IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology,2020
Ground Moving Vehicle Detection and Movement Tracking Based on the Neuromorphic Vision Sensor,"Moving-objects detection is a critical ability for an autonomous vehicle. Facing the high detection requirements and the slow target-extraction problem of a common camera, this article proposes to utilize neuromorphic vision sensor (DVS) for detecting the moving objects and estimating their movement states. For a better detection work, the DVS image's noise points are filtered and the CTRV kinematics model is built in advance. In order to distinguish the overlapped or nearby bodies and get the accurate clustering number, this article proposes a 3-D improved K -means method. As the clustering centers can be influenced by the movement easily, the moving objects' clustering centers appear unstable, so the movement estimation also fluctuates. In order to obtain stable movement estimation, this article proposes a strong tracking center differential external Kalman filter (SCDEKF) to track the moving objects, and the method has higher accuracy and less computational load. In order to verify the advantages of proposed methods, a simulation environment was established in the Gazebo, and the common cameras were also added in simulation for comparison with the DVS sensor. The simulation results show that the 3-D improved K -means method with DVS can cluster the moving objects accurately, and the SCDEKF can provide more accurate movement estimation than the traditional EKF method. Finally, two experiments were conducted to prove the methods' superiority. The main contribution is to solve the exploitation problems faced by the short-term borne sensor and promote its application in transportation.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9112163,IEEE Internet of Things Journal,2020
A Hybrid Command Governor Scheme for Rotary Wings Unmanned Aerial Vehicles,"In this paper, we develop an obstacle avoidance control scheme for autonomous aerial vehicles. The strategy is based on command governor (CG) ideas that are here extended to take into account nonconvex constraints typically arising in path planning obstacle avoidance problems. As one of its main merits, the collision avoidance task is accomplished by exploiting convex inner approximations of the obstacle-free region and an ad hoc constraints switching procedure which significantly reduces the online computations pertaining to the CG design. Experimental results on the quadrotor Qball-X4 show the applicability and effectiveness of the proposed approach.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8550656,IEEE Transactions on Control Systems Technology,2020
Enhanced Object Detection With Deep Convolutional Neural Networks for Advanced Driving Assistance,"Object detection is a critical problem for advanced driving assistance systems (ADAS). Recently, convolutional neural networks (CNN) achieved large successes on object detection, with performance improvement over traditional approaches, which use hand-engineered features. However, due to the challenging driving environment (e.g., large object scale variation, object occlusion, and bad light conditions), popular CNN detectors do not achieve very good object detection accuracy over the KITTI autonomous driving benchmark dataset. In this paper, we propose three enhancements for CNN-based visual object detection for ADAS. To address the large object scale variation challenge, deconvolution and fusion of CNN feature maps are proposed to add context and deeper features for better object detection at low feature map scales. In addition, soft non-maximal suppression (NMS) is applied across object proposals at different feature scales to address the object occlusion challenge. As the cars and pedestrians have distinct aspect ratio features, we measure their aspect ratio statistics and exploit them to set anchor boxes properly for better object matching and localization. The proposed CNN enhancements are evaluated with various image input sizes by experiments over KITTI dataset. The experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed enhancements with good detection performance over KITTI test set.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8694965,IEEE Transactions on Intelligent Transportation Systems,2020
Optimal Dynamic Pricing for Trading-Off User Utility and Operator Profit in Smart Grid,"A conventional power grid is criticized by its poor capability of power usage management, especially in handling dynamically varying power demands over time. The concept of smart grid has been introduced to mitigate this problem by satisfying not only real-time power demands, but also by restricting power usage within the capacity. Its consistent outperformance and new perspective in computer intelligence to control the grid for autonomous power consumption has been gradually replacing the conventional power grid. However, even in smart grid, providing high satisfaction to users often leads smart grid operator (SGO) to loss and vice versa. In this paper, we develop an optimal dynamic pricing mechanism for trading-off (ODPT), for SGOs that tradeoff between user utility and operator profit in smart grid systems. It allows the operator to purchase power from multiple energy producers and to set selling price to users dynamically following the demand-supply theory of economics. It also exploits an artificial neural network model to more accurately predict the power usage. The simulation results, carried out on a commercially available optimization modeling tool using practical power usage data, prove the effectiveness of the proposed ODPT in increasing the operator profit while satisfying user demands.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8113531,"IEEE Transactions on Systems, Man, and Cybernetics: Systems",2020
Cyber Vulnerability Intelligence for Internet of Things Binary,"Internet of Things (IoT) integrates a variety of software (e.g., autonomous vehicles and military systems) in order to enable the advanced and intelligent services. These software increase the potential of cyber-attacks because an adversary can launch an attack using system vulnerabilities. Existing software vulnerability analysis methods used to be relying on human experts crafted features, which usually miss many vulnerabilities. It is important to develop an automatic vulnerability analysis system to improve the countermeasures. However, source code is not always available (e.g., most IoT related industry software are closed source). Therefore, vulnerability detection on binary code is a demanding task. This article addresses the automatic binary-level software vulnerability detection problem by proposing a deep learning-based approach. The proposed approach consists of two phases: binary function extraction, and model building. First, we extract binary functions from the cleaned binary instructions obtained by using IDA Pro. Then, we employ the attention mechanism on top of a bidirectional long short-term memory for building the predictive model. To show the effectiveness of the proposed approach, we have collected datasets from several different sources. We have compared our proposed approach with a series of baselines including source code-based techniques and binary code-based techniques. We have also applied the proposed approach to real-world IoT related software such as VLC media player and LibTIFF project that used on Autonomous Vehicles. Experimental results show that our proposed approach betters the baselines and is able to detect more vulnerabilities.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8892533,IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics,2020
On Wireless Blind Spots in the C-V2X Sidelink,"The third generation partnership project (3GPP) has issued specifications for the autonomous assignment of radio resources by vehicles on the sidelink of the cellular-vehicle-to-everything (C-V2X) technology. It is based on a sensing mechanism for resource selection and a semi-persistent scheduling for resource reservation to periodic safety messages. Imperfect sensing due to hidden terminals and to half-duplex on board transceivers may result in the selection of interfered resources for successive message transmissions. As a consequence of the lost packets, involved vehicles may become blind to the presence of other vehicles in their vicinity even for many seconds, with threats to the road safety. In this paper, we define these events as wireless blind spots (WBSs) and characterize their probability to occur. We propose an enhancement to the autonomous mode in order to reduce the WBS duration and demonstrate the benefits of the proposal against the legacy mode, both analytically in a simplified scenario and through simulations in a highway environment.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9112708,IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology,2020
Observer-Based Control for Cyber-Physical Systems With Periodic DoS Attacks via a Cyclic Switching Strategy,"This article studies the observer-based output feedback control problem for a class of cyber-physical systems with periodic denial-of-service (DoS) attacks, where the attacks coexist both in the measurement and control channels in the network scenario. The periodic DoS attacks are characterized by a cyclic dwell-time switching strategy, such that the resulting augmented system can be converted into a class of discrete-time cyclic dwell-time switched systems including a stable subsystem and an unstable subsystem. By means of a cyclic piecewise linear Lyapunov function approach, the exponential stability and $l_2$-gain analysis, and observer-based controller design are carried out for the augmented discrete-time cyclic switched system. Then, the desired observer and controller gains in piecewise linear form are determined simultaneously so as to ensure that the resulting closed-loop system is exponentially stable with a prescribed $\mathcal {H}_{\infty }$ performance index. Finally, a practical application of unmanned ground vehicles under periodic DoS attacks is provided to verify the effectiveness of the developed control approach.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8897656,IEEE Transactions on Automatic Control,2020
Opportunistic UAV Navigation With Carrier Phase Measurements From Asynchronous Cellular Signals,"This article presents a framework for opportunistic unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) navigation by exploiting carrier phase measurements from ambient cellular signals of opportunity. In the proposed framework, the cellular base transceiver stations (BTSs) are not assumed to be synchronous. A complete framework that employs an extended Kalman filter (EKF) is presented, including filter initialization and process and measurement noise covariance selection. The EKF estimates the position and velocity of the UAV, as well as the differences between the UAV-mounted receiver and each of the BTSs' clock bias and clock drift. The observability of the estimation framework is analyzed, and the boundedness of the EKF's errors is studied. It is shown that the system is observable given a class of vehicle and receiver clock dynamics. A lower bound for the EKF estimation error covariance is derived, and it is shown that the covariance remains bounded. Monte Carlo simulations are conducted to study the effect of the number of BTSs, the initial UAV speed, and the receiver's oscillator quality, on the estimation performance. Two sets of experimental results are presented demonstrating UAVs navigating exclusively with cellular carrier phase measurements via the developed framework, achieving a total position root-mean-squared error of 2.94 and 5.99 m for UAV trajectories of 2.6 and 2.9 km, respectively.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8883288,IEEE Transactions on Aerospace and Electronic Systems,2020
Learning-Based Real-Time Process-Aware Anomaly Monitoring for Assured Autonomy,"Various learning-based approaches have been proposed recently for robot control in complex unknown environments. However, ensuring safety in these systems is essential. Learning-based approaches are usually black-box systems which are difficult to interpret/verify. We propose a real-time continuous safety checking system which monitors the validity of the mapping from the sensor input to the actuator command (i.e., controller-focused anomaly detection) and from the actuator command to the sensor input (i.e., system-focused anomaly detection). Our controller-focused anomaly monitor is an image conditioned energy based generative adversarial network in which the discriminator acts as an energy function attributing low energies to proper actuator commands and high energy to anomalous actuator commands. Our system-focused anomaly monitor is based on an action condition video prediction framework, which finds the action conditioned future frame most similar to the actual future frame and compares it with the true action to detect anomaly. We experimentally demonstrate the effectiveness of our framework for an autonomous navigation system in indoor (on datasets from our ground vehicle) and outdoor environments (on Udacity dataset). Furthermore, we show through experimental evaluations that our proposed framework is resilient to various data corruptions common in a vision based system.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9099389,IEEE Transactions on Intelligent Vehicles,2020
Path Planning Under Malicious Injections and Removals of Perceived Obstacles: A Probabilistic Programming Approach,"An autonomous mobile robot may encounter adversarial environments in which an attacker tries to influence its decisions. Through physical or software-level attacks, some of the robot's sensors might be compromised-a special concern for self-driving vehicles. Motivated by this scenario, this letter introduces and studies the problem of planning kinematically feasible (and possibly efficient) paths with bounded collision probability in adversarial settings where the obstacles perceived online by the robot display two layers of uncertainty. The first is the “usual” Gaussian uncertainty one would obtain from a standard object tracker (e.g., an Extended Kalman Filter); the second is an additional layer of uncertainty that captures possible sensor attacks and describes the actual existence of groups of obstacles in the environment. We study the complexity of the problem and propose a general sampling-based solution framework that uses the Sequential Probability Ratio Test (SPRT) to check collision probability constraints along the computed trajectory. We also show how probabilistic programming languages (PPLs) can simplify programming common algorithms (such as RRT and Hybrid A*) for mixed uncertainty. In addition to providing an easy-to-use programming framework, our approach is shown to plan safer paths compared to a Naive Monte Carlo baseline when both approaches are allowed to use at most the same given number of samples to perform collision checks.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9184965,IEEE Robotics and Automation Letters,2020
Drones in Distress: A Game-Theoretic Countermeasure for Protecting UAVs Against GPS Spoofing,"One prominent security threat that targets unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) is the capture via global positioning system (GPS) spoofing in which an attacker manipulates a UAV's GPS signals in order to capture it. Given the anticipated widespread deployment of UAVs for various purposes, it is imperative to develop new security solutions against such attacks. In this article, a mathematical framework is introduced for analyzing and mitigating the effects of GPS spoofing attacks on UAVs. In particular, system dynamics are used to model the optimal routes that the UAVs will adopt to reach their destinations. The GPS spoofer's effect on each UAV's route is also captured by the model. To this end, the spoofer's optimal imposed locations on the UAVs, are analytically derived; allowing the UAVs to predict their traveling routes under attack. Then, a countermeasure mechanism is developed to mitigate the effect of the GPS spoofing attack. The countermeasure is built on the premise of cooperative localization, in which a UAV can determine its location using nearby UAVs instead of the possibly compromised GPS locations. To better utilize the proposed defense mechanism, a dynamic Stackelberg game is formulated to model the interactions between a GPS spoofer and a drone operator. In particular, the drone operator acts as the leader that determines its optimal strategy in light of the spoofer's expected response strategy. The equilibrium strategies of the game are then analytically characterized and studied through a novel proposed algorithm. The simulation results show that, when combined with the Stackelberg strategies, the proposed defense mechanism will outperform baseline strategy selection techniques in terms of reducing the possibility of UAV capture.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8946587,IEEE Internet of Things Journal,2020
Attack Analysis and Resilient Control Design for Discrete-Time Distributed Multi-Agent Systems,"This work analyzes the adverse effects of cyberphysical attacks on discrete-time distributed multi-agent systems, and proposes a mitigation approach for attacks on sensors and actuators. First, we show how an attack on a single node snowballs into a network-wide attack and even destabilizes the entire system. Next, to overcome the adversarial effects of attacks on sensors and actuators, a distributed adaptive attack compensator is designed by estimating the normal expected behavior of agents. The adaptive attack compensator is augmented with the controller and it is shown that the proposed controller achieves secure consensus in the presence of the attacks on sensors and actuators. No restrictive assumption on the number of agents under adversarial input is assumed. Moreover, it recovers compromised agents under actuator attacks and avoids propagation of attacks on sensors without discarding information from the compromised agents. Finally, numerical simulations validate the effectiveness of the presented theoretical contributions on a network of Sentry autonomous underwater vehicles.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8932605,IEEE Robotics and Automation Letters,2020
Poisoning and Evasion Attacks Against Deep Learning Algorithms in Autonomous Vehicles,"With the ongoing development and improvement of deep learning technology, autonomous vehicles (AVs) have made tremendous progress in recent years. Despite its great potential, AV supported by deep learning technology still faces numerous security threats, which prevent AV from being putting into large-scale practice. Aiming at this challenging situation, in this paper, we would like to exploit two attacks against deep learning algorithms in traffic sign recognition system by leveraging particle swarm optimization. Specifically, we first exploit the PAPSO (poisoning attack with particle swarm optimization) which focuses on the training process of the deep learning algorithms in the traffic sign recognition system, i.e., the attacker injects crafted samples into the training dataset, causing a reduction in classification accuracy of the traffic sign recognition system. Then, we also explore the EAPSO (evasion attack with particle swarm optimization) which on the other hand focuses on the interference process of the deep learning algorithms, i.e., the attacker adds some hardly perceptible perturbations to the targeted test sample, leading to a misclassification on it. Extensive experiments are conducted to shed light on the effectiveness of our attacks, and some corresponding defense strategies are also presented.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9019666,IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology,2020
Performance of Joint Sensing-Communication Cooperative Sensing UAV Network,"To exploit the spectrum reuse potential and enhance the cooperative sensing ability of the cooperative sensing unmanned aerial vehicle network (CSUN), we propose a novel joint sensing-communication (JSC) CSUN that can simultaneously conduct downward-looking radar sensing and sensing data fusion communication with the unified spectrum and transceiver by adopting the beam sharing scheme. To achieve the beam sharing scheme, we design a novel antenna array equipped on each UAV, which can generate a sensing beam and a communication beam orthogonally for downward detection and data-fusion communication, respectively. To quantify the cooperative sensing performance of CSUN, we propose and formulate a novel upper-bound average cooperative sensing area (UB-ACSA) as the cooperative sensing performance metric, based on deriving the closed-form expressions for the average mutual sensing interference of CSUN and the communication capacity constraints. Finally, extensive simulations are conducted to validate the theoretical results. We also demonstrate that the cooperative sensing performance of the JSC CSUN can improve by 66.3 percent compared with the conventional CSUN in terms of UB-ACSA.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9282206,IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology,2020
Online Computation Offloading and Traffic Routing for UAV Swarms in Edge-Cloud Computing,"Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) swarms are widely applied for service provisioning in many domains such as topographic mapping and traffic monitoring. These UAV applications are complicated as they demand not only huge computational resources but also strict latency requirements. However, due to the limited onboard resources of UAVs as well as various dynamics of applications and environments, it's challenging to obtain a feasible computation offloading policy in online environments. To cope with these problems, we propose an online algorithm for UAV swarms to jointly optimize the computation offloading and multi-hop routing scheduling in the Edge-Cloud environment. First, we propose a UAV-Edge-Cloud computing model to meet the requirements of latency and computing capability. We then formulate a joint optimization of workflow assignment and multi-hop routing scheduling in order to minimize the computation cost and latency. To tackle this NP-hard problem, an algorithm based on the Markov approximation technique is designed to obtain near-optimal solutions. Furthermore, to achieve high long-term performance in online environments, we exploit Lyapunov optimization to control the migration cost caused by the dynamics of application and environment. Finally, extensive simulation results demonstrate that our approach achieves a long-term high-efficiency and stable performance in an online environment for UAV swarms with respect to computation offloading and traffic routing.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9093980,IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology,2020
Robust Fault-Tolerant Control for Underactuated Takeoff and Landing UAVs,"This article surveys the trajectory tracking issue of underactuated vertical takeoff and landing (VTOL) unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) subject to thrust and torque faults, i.e., loss of efficiency and actuator biases. In particular, a robust control algorithm against time-varying faults and disturbances is proposed. To exploit the underactuated nature of the VTOL UAV system, the control algorithm is developed based on a hierarchical framework, under which the position and attitude loops are studied in sequence. Specifically, by implementing a novel robust fault-tolerant control strategy, a force command is first synthesized for the position tracking to the desired trajectory, and then, a desired torque using an innovative sliding manifold is designed such that the nonsingular attitude tracking to an attitude command is achieved. This attitude command, as well as the desired thrust, is extracted from the synthesized force command. In terms of hierarchical system stability theory, it is shown that the overall closed-loop error system is asymptotically stable. Finally, simulation results validate and highlight the tracking performance of the proposed control algorithm.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9037179,IEEE Transactions on Aerospace and Electronic Systems,2020
Learning the Time-Varying Massive MIMO Channels: Robust Estimation and Data-Aided Prediction,"The quasi-static assumption of channels becomes invalid in a number of emerging applications of massive multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) systems with high base station (BS)/user mobility, such as high speed train and unmanned aerial vehicle communications. In these situations, the time variation of channels shortens the channel coherence time and decreases the efficiency of traditional channel estimation schemes significantly. This paper focuses on the time-varying channel estimation problem in massive MIMO systems, where the mobility of BS/user is assumed to be high. The sparse property of the time-varying massive MIMO channels is analyzed, which reveals that the angular domain channels exhibit two kinds of spatial-temporal sparse (STS) structures, namely the temporal-common sparse structure and spatial-clustered sparse structure. By exploiting the STS structures, a novel structured variational Bayesian inference (VBI) framework is formulated to make a robust channel estimation during the training phase. A data-aided channel predication scheme is further proposed to combat the time variation of the channels during the data transmission phase without increasing the pilot consumption. The simulation results demonstrate the superiority of the proposed scheme in the time-varying scenarios with different BS/user mobilities.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8966466,IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology,2020
Self-Energized UAV-Assisted Scheme for Cooperative Wireless Relay Networks,"Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) have recently been envisaged as an enabling technology of 5G. UAVs act as an intermediate relay node to facilitate uninterrupted, high quality communication between information sources and their destination. However, UAV energy management has been a major issue of consideration due to limited power supply, affecting flight duration. Thus, we introduce in this paper a unified energy management framework by resorting to wireless power transfer (WPT), simultaneous wireless information and power transfer (SWIPT) and self-interference (SI) energy harvesting (EH) schemes, in cooperative relay communications. In our new technique, UAVs are deployed as relays equipped with a decode and forward protocol and EH capability operating in a full-duplex (FD) mode. The UAV assists information transmission between a terrestrial base station and a user. The UAV's transmission capability is powered exclusively by the energy harvested from WPT, radio frequency signal transmitted from the source via time-switching SWIPT protocol and SI exploitation. We improve the overall system throughput by the use of FD based UAV-assisted cooperative system. In this proposed system, we formulate two optimization problems to minimize end-to-end outage probability, subject to UAV's power profile and trajectory for a DF relay scheme, respectively. The KKT conditions have been used to obtain closed-form solutions for the two formulated problems. Numerical simulation results validate all the theoretical results. We demonstrate that the performance of our proposed unified EH scheme outperforms that of existing techniques in the literature.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8892608,IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology,2020
Anti-Jamming 3D Trajectory Design for UAV-Enabled Wireless Sensor Networks Under Probabilistic LoS Channel,"This paper investigates the anti-jamming three-dimensional (3D) trajectory design to safeguard the legitimate communications of unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV)-enabled wireless sensor networks (WSNs). Specifically, a UAV is dispatched to collect data over multiple ground sensors (GSs) in the presence of a malicious ground jammer. Under the practical probabilistic line-of-sight (LoS) channel model, we aim to maximize the minimum (average) expected rate among GSs over a finite flight period, by jointly optimizing the GS transmission scheduling, the UAV horizontal and vertical trajectories. To make the formulated non-convex problem tractable, we provide an achievable lower bound for the expected rate, based on which an efficient iterative algorithm is proposed to solve it suboptimally by exploiting the block coordinate descent and successive convex approximation techniques. Numerical results show the significant rate improvement of the proposed joint design and provide new insights into the anti-jamming 3D trajectory design under the probabilistic LoS model, as compared to the conventional two-dimensional (2D) UAV trajectory or under LoS channel models.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9271902,IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology,2020
A Discriminative Distillation Network for Cross-Source Remote Sensing Image Retrieval,"Nowadays, several remote sensing image capturing technologies are used ranging from unmanned aerial vehicles to satellites. Powerful learning-based discriminative features play an essential role in content-based remote sensing image retrieval (CBRSIR). Cross-source CBRSIR (CS-CBRSIR) is used to find relevant remote sensing images across different remote sensing sources (i.e., multispectral images and panchromatic images). But it is limited by large cross-source and intrasource variations caused by different semantic objects, spatial resolution, and spectral resolution. The main limitation of CS-CBRSIR is that it cannot address the inconsistency between different sources and exploit the intrinsic relation between them. This study proposes a discriminative distillation network for CS-CBRSIR to address this limitation. To enlarge the interclass variations and reduce the intraclass differences, the discriminative features from the first source are first extracted with a well-designed joint optimization configuration (JOC) on the basis of deep neural networks. Thereafter, the features extracted from the first source are used as a supervision signal for the second source; feature distribution in common feature space between the first and second sources are made significantly similar. The method proposed in this study simultaneously handles the cross-source and intersource variations, unlike the existing methods. Extensive experiments on the DSRSID dataset with Euclidean distance verify the effectiveness of our proposed method.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9044737,IEEE Journal of Selected Topics in Applied Earth Observations and Remote Sensing,2020
Graph-Based File Dispatching Protocol With D2D-Enhanced UAV-NOMA Communications in Large-Scale Networks,"As a newly emerging communication assistant equipment, unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) can be exploited to dispatch data files quickly to specific areas and support rapid deployment of communication links in complex terrain, which is of great significance for specific communication demands in disaster and remote areas. Nonorthogonal multiple access (NOMA), as a rosy technology in the fifth generation (5G) and future mobile communication systems, has been widely studied because of its ability in improving spectral efficiency and reducing transmission latency to enhance the overall Quality of Service (QoS) and meet the strict communication requirements. Based on these, in this article, we propose a device-to-device (D2D)-enhanced UAV-NOMA network architecture, in which D2D is introduced to increase the file dispatching efficiency. In our proposed D2D-enhanced UAV-NOMA network, the ground users (GUEs) that have already received file blocks (FBs) are allowed to reuse the time-frequency resources assigned to NOMA links to share their FBs with other GUEs, which significantly improves the efficiency of file dispatching. But this also leads to a complicated interference environment. In order to effectively manage the interference and minimize the UAV-assisted file dispatching mission time, we propose a graph-based file dispatching (GFD) protocol, in which the complicated joint optimization problem is decomposed to be solved efficiently and graph theory-based algorithms are proposed for resource allocation. The simulation results verify the advantages of our proposed D2D-enhanced UAV-NOMA network architecture and the efficiency of our designed GFD protocol in minimizing the total UAV-assisted file dispatching mission time.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9094242,IEEE Internet of Things Journal,2020
Incentivizing Resource Cooperation for Blockchain Empowered Wireless Power Transfer in UAV Networks,"In unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) networks, UAVs-assisted wireless power transfer is a promising approach to charge low-power smart devices for energy replenishment. However, security and privacy concerns associated with the energy micro-transactions in untrusted wireless trading environment present serious challenges. In this paper, we exploit Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) and consortium blockchain to propose a new distributed and secure UAVs-assisted wireless power transfer framework named aerial-ground chain, where heterogeneous consensus is developed to verify the energy micro-transactions. Specifically, the UAVs verify energy micro-transactions simultaneously but asynchronously to form an aerial tangle. The smart devices also participate in maintaining the aerial tangle. We define timeout for the energy micro-transactions, and leverage a set of Access Points (APs) to cooperatively confirm the timeout energy micro-transaction by utilizing consortium blockchain, to form a ground main chain. Furthermore, a contract theory based resource cooperation scheme is designed to motivate the UAVs to participate in wireless power transfer, and to incentivize the APs to contribute their resources in cooperatively verifying the timeout energy micro-transactions. Security analysis and numerical results illustrate that the developed aerial-ground chain and the designed contract theory based resource cooperation scheme are secure and efficient for UAVs-assisted wireless power transfer.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9250682,IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology,2020
State-Aware Rate Adaptation for UAVs by Incorporating On-Board Sensors,"Nowadays unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) are being widely applied to a wealth of civil and military applications. Robust and high-throughput wireless communication is the crux of these UAV applications. Yet, air-to-ground links suffer from time-varying channels induced by the agile mobility and dynamic environments. Rate adaptation algorithms are generally used to choose the optimal data rate based on the current channel conditions. State-of-the-art approaches leverage physical layer information for rate adaptation, and they work well under certain conditions. However, the above protocols still have limitation under constantly changing flight states and environments for air-to-ground links. To solve this problem, we propose StateRate, a state-optimized rate adaptation algorithm that fully exploits the characteristics of UAV systems using a hybrid deep learning model. The key observation is that the rate adaptation strategy needs to be adjusted according to motion-dependent channel models, which can be reflected by flight states. In this work, the rate adaptation protocol is enhanced with the help of the on-board sensors in UAVs. To make full use of the sensor data, we introduce a learning-based prediction module by leveraging the internal state and an online learning algorithm by employing the pre-trained model that adapts the rate adaptation algorithm to different environments. We implement our algorithm on a commercial UAV platform and evaluate it in various environments. The results demonstrate that our system outperforms the best-known rate adaptation algorithm up to 53% in terms of throughput when the velocity is 2-6 m/s.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8886362,IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology,2020
The Optimal Distance Threshold for Fractional Frequency Reuse in Size-Scalable Networks,"In the fractional frequency reuse (FFR) system, the bandwidth is partitioned into orthogonal subbands such that users in the cell-center region use the subbands of a frequency reuse factor (FR factor) equal to 1, whereas users in the cell-edge region exploit the subbands of an FR factor larger than 1. The distance threshold, which is used to distinguish the cell-edge region from the cell-center region, is an important factor in FFR system performance. In this paper, we study the optimal distance threshold to maximize system throughput in the downlink cellular networks, including aerial base stations. Subject to the constraint that a given target outage probability is satisfied, the optimal distance threshold is analyzed as a function of the cell size. It is proven that when the sizes of all cells in the network are scaled at the same rate, the optimal distance threshold normalized by the cell size is nondecreasing in the cell size. The analytical results in this paper provide a system design guideline for initial planning of FFR cellular networks of different sizes, including macro, pico, and femto systems. In particular, for size-scalable aerial networks comprising base stations in the sky, such as balloons or unmanned aerial vehicles, our analysis offers insight into the design of the distance threshold with regard to the cell size.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8863946,IEEE Transactions on Aerospace and Electronic Systems,2020
Vid2Param: Modeling of Dynamics Parameters From Video,"Sensors are routinely mounted on robots to acquire various forms of measurements in spatio-temporal fields. Locating features within these fields and reconstruction (mapping) of the dense fields can be challenging in resource-constrained situations, such as when trying to locate the source of a gas leak from a small number of measurements. In such cases, a model of the underlying complex dynamics can be exploited to discover informative paths within the field. We use a fluid simulator as a model, to guide inference for the location of a gas leak. We perform localization via minimization of the discrepancy between observed measurements and gas concentrations predicted by the simulator. Our method is able to account for dynamically varying parameters of wind flow (e.g., direction and strength), and its effects on the observed distribution of gas. We develop algorithms for off-line inference as well as for on-line path discovery via active sensing. We demonstrate the efficiency, accuracy and versatility of our algorithm using experiments with a physical robot conducted in outdoor environments. We deploy an unmanned air vehicle (UAV) mounted with a CO2 sensor to automatically seek out a gas cylinder emitting CO2 via a nozzle. We evaluate the accuracy of our algorithm by measuring the error in the inferred location of the nozzle, based on which we show that our proposed approach is competitive with respect to state of the art baselines.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8931564,IEEE Robotics and Automation Letters,2020
Curb Detection and Tracking in Low-Resolution 3D Point Clouds Based on Optimization Framework,"Curb detection and tracking is an essential component of autonomous vehicle operation in urban environments. Detecting curbs is a particularly challenging task in urban environments that contain countless dynamic objects. Previous studies have approached curb detection using different types of sensor such as cameras, radar, and LIDAR. Among these, LIDAR sensors have superior advantages in regard to detecting curbs because of their robustness in different weather conditions and they can provide accurate distance measurements. Previous methods based on LIDAR have exploited high-resolution 3D point clouds using high-cost LIDARs. However, the processing of large volumes of information is inefficient for autonomous driving technologies because of real time constraints. This paper presents a novel real-time curb detection and tracking algorithm that makes use of a low-resolution LIDAR. The proposed method consists of three steps. First is the extraction of curb candidates based on Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and Density-Based Spatial Clustering of Applications with Noise (DBSCAN). Second is the selection of the optimal candidate using an optimization framework. Lastly is the tracking of the detected curbs. In the tracking module, we use a combination of spatial consistency and validation gate to track the curb in the occlusion region with dynamic objects. Experiments on a public dataset show that the proposed method achieved 91.54% and 89.76% F1 score on the straight and curved road while running at about 18 ms per frame, thereby outperforming the state-of-the-art by a large margin. In addition, we integrated the proposed method with the localization module of our autonomous driving platform. The localization module integrated with the proposed method reduces the positional and lateral root mean square (RMS) error of the vehicle localization by 3.58% and 6.68% respectively. In addition, we compare this method with a deep neural network based method from the perspective of a safety-critical system such as self-driving cars.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8826330,IEEE Transactions on Intelligent Transportation Systems,2020
Energy-Efficient Mobile Crowdsensing by Unmanned Vehicles: A Sequential Deep Reinforcement Learning Approach,"Mobile crowdsensing (MCS) is an attractive and innovative paradigm in which a crowd of users equipped with smart mobile devices (such as smartphones and iPads), and more recently unmanned vehicles (UVs, e.g., driverless cars and drones) conduct sensing tasks in mobile social networks by fully exploiting their carried diverse embedded sensors. These devices, especially UVs, are usually constrained by limited sensing range and energy reserve of devices, which contribute to the restriction of one single UV task performance, and thus UV collaborations are fully favored. In this article, we explicitly consider navigating a group of UVs to collect different kinds of data in a city, with the presence of multiple charging stations. Different from the existing approaches that solve the problem by forming a constrained optimization problem, we propose a novel sequential deep model called “PPO+LSTM,” which contains a sequential model LSTM and is trained with proximal policy optimization (PPO), for assigning tasks and planning route. We evaluate our model in different network settings when comparing with other state-of-the-art solutions, and we also show the impact of important hyperparameters of our model. Results show that our solution outperforms all others in terms of energy efficiency, data collection ratio, and geographic fairness.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8944303,IEEE Internet of Things Journal,2020
A Novel Method for Protecting Swimmers and Surfers From Shark Attacks Using Communicating Autonomous Drones,"Shark attacks can make beach tourists anxious about sharing the ocean with apex predators. Although the raw number of shark attacks is deficient, the absolute terror caused by sharks is genuine. This article introduces a novel method named as the “drone shark shield system,” which uses communicating autonomous drones to intervene and prevent shark attacks for protecting swimmers and surfers. We detail the design of the drone shark shield system and the strategy for repelling sharks through multiple intersections. A shark interception algorithm is developed to guide drones to predicted intersection points for deterring sharks. Computer simulations are conducted to illustrate our method.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9068241,IEEE Internet of Things Journal,2020
"Cooperative Routing for an Air–Ground Vehicle Team—Exact Algorithm, Transformation Method, and Heuristics","This paper considers a cooperative vehicle routing problem for an intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance mission in the presence of communication constraints between the vehicles. The proposed framework uses a ground vehicle and an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) that travel cooperatively and visit a set of targets while satisfying the communication constraints. The problem is formulated as a mixed-integer linear program, and a branch-and-cut algorithm is developed to solve the problem to optimality. Furthermore, a transformation method and a heuristic are also developed for the problem. The effectiveness of all the algorithms is corroborated through extensive computational experiments on several randomly generated instances. This paper is motivated by an intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance mission involving a single unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) and a ground vehicle, where the vehicles must coordinate their activity in the presence of communication constraints. The combination of a small UAV and a ground vehicle is an ideal platform for such missions, since small UAVs can fly at low altitudes and can avoid obstacles or threats that would be problematic for the ground vehicle alone. This paper addresses the coordinated routing problem involving these two vehicles and presents an algorithm to obtain an optimal solution for this problem, fast heuristics to obtain good feasible solutions, and also a transformation method to transform any instance of this cooperative vehicle routing problem to an instance of the one-in-a-set traveling salesman problem.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8798870,IEEE Transactions on Automation Science and Engineering,2020
Integrated Positioning for Connected Vehicles,"In the era of autonomous cars, accurate vehicular positioning becomes very essential. The global navigation satellite systems (GNSS) suffer from signal blockage and severe multipath in urban canyons, which degrades the positioning accuracy and availability. Therefore, vehicles solely relying on positioning from GNSS receivers have limited performance. In this research, we present a novel unified cooperative positioning solution which enhances positioning accuracy and availability in urban canyons. The proposed system exploits the fact that vehicles have different positioning resources and is based on angle approximation, which artificially generates the hindered pseudorange by sharing angle information between vehicles using dedicated short-range communication. In addition, we propose a system that employs the proposed cooperative technique to assist the loose integration between the inertial navigation system (INS) and the GPS system (using extended Kalman filter) during partial GPS outages. Using raw data from inertial sensors and GPS receivers in the real road trajectories, we implement the cooperative INS/GPS loose integration and show that our cooperative integrated system outperforms the non-cooperative integrated system. The performance metrics used are the 2-D positioning root-mean-square error, the maximum 2-D positioning error, and the positioning accuracy gain (PAG). Specifically, the PAG gain is around 88%, 80%, and 60% when the number of blocked satellites is one, two, and three, respectively.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8638823,IEEE Transactions on Intelligent Transportation Systems,2020
Wildfire Fighting by Unmanned Aerial System Exploiting Its Time-Varying Mass,"This letter presents an approach for accurately dropping a relatively large amount of fire retardant, water or some other extinguishing agent onto a wildfire from an autonomous unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV), in close proximity to the epicenter of the fire. The proposed approach involves a risky maneuver outside of the safe flight envelope of the UAV. This maneuver exploits the expected weight reduction resulting from the release of the payload, enabling the UAV to recover without impacting the terrain. The UAV is tilted to high pitch angles, at which the thrust may be pointed almost horizontally. The vehicle can therefore achieve higher horizontal speeds than would be allowed by conventional motion planners. This high speed allows the UAV to significantly reduce the time spent close to the fire. As a result, the overall high heat exposure is reduced, and the payload can be dropped closer to the target, minimizing its dispersion. A constrained optimal control problem (OCP) is solved taking into account environmental parameters such as wind and terrain gradients, as well as various payload releasing mechanisms. The proposed approach was verified in simulations and in real experiments. Emphasis was put on the real time recalculation of the solution, which will enable future adaptation into a model predictive controller (MPC) scheme.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8989795,IEEE Robotics and Automation Letters,2020
On the Design of Conditional Privacy Preserving Batch Verification-Based Authentication Scheme for Internet of Vehicles Deployment,"In the Internet of Vehicles (IoV), secure information sharing among vehicles is crucial in order to upgrade driving safety as well as to strengthen vehicular services. However, public communication among vehicles leads to various potential attacks, such as replay, man-in-the-middle, impersonation, unlinkability and traceability attacks. To address this issue, we design a new conditional privacy preserving batch verification-based authentication mechanism in the IoV environment using Elliptic Curve Cryptography (ECC) technique, where a vehicle can authenticate its neighbor vehicle and also a Road-Side Unit (RSU) can authenticate its nearby vehicles in a batch. The proposed scheme is shown to be highly secure against a passive/active adversary through various security analysis, such as random oracle based formal security, formal security verification via automated simulation tool, and also informal security analysis. An exhaustive comparative analysis reveals that the proposed scheme offers better security and functionality attributes, and comparable storage, communication and computation overheads when these are compared with the relevant schemes.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9042206,IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology,2020
Robust Autonomous Navigation of Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) for Warehouses’ Inventory Application,"The inventory inspection using autonomous unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) is beneficial in terms of cost, time, and safety of human workers. However, in typical warehouses, it is very challenging for the autonomous UAVs to do inventory task motions safely because aisles are narrow and long, and the illumination is poor. Prior autonomous UAVs are not suitable for such environments, since they suffer from either localization methods prone to disturbance, drift and outliers, or expensive sensors. We present a low-cost sensing system with an extended Kalman filter (EKF)-based multi-sensor fusion framework to achieve practical autonomous navigation of UAVs in warehouse environments. To overcome the inherent drift, outliers, and disturbance problems of naïve UAV localization methods, we suggest 1) exploiting component test of Mahalanobis norm to reject outliers efficiently, 2) introducing pseudo-covariance to incorporate a visual SLAM algorithm, and 3) recognizing floor lanes to get absolute information–as robust data fusion methods. Exemplar results are provided to demonstrate the effectiveness of the methods. The proposed system has been successfully implemented for diverse cyclic inventory inspection tasks in a materials warehouse.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8908692,IEEE Robotics and Automation Letters,2020
Don’t Forget The Past: Recurrent Depth Estimation from Monocular Video,"Autonomous cars need continuously updated depth information. Thus far, depth is mostly estimated independently for a single frame at a time, even if the method starts from video input. Our method produces a time series of depth maps, which makes it an ideal candidate for online learning approaches. In particular, we put three different types of depth estimation (supervised depth prediction, self-supervised depth prediction, and self-supervised depth completion) into a common framework. We integrate the corresponding networks with a ConvLSTM such that the spatiotemporal structures of depth across frames can be exploited to yield a more accurate depth estimation. Our method is flexible. It can be applied to monocular videos only or be combined with different types of sparse depth patterns. We carefully study the architecture of the recurrent network and its training strategy. We are first to successfully exploit recurrent networks for real-time self-supervised monocular depth estimation and completion. Extensive experiments show that our recurrent method outperforms its image-based counterpart consistently and significantly in both self-supervised scenarios. It also outperforms previous depth estimation methods of the three popular groups. Please refer to our webpage11https://www.trace.ethz.ch/publications/2020/rec_depth_estimation/ for details.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9170769,IEEE Robotics and Automation Letters,2020
Behavioral Biometrics for Continuous Authentication in the Internet-of-Things Era: An Artificial Intelligence Perspective,"In the Internet-of-Things (IoT) era, user authentication is essential to ensure the security of connected devices and the customization of passive services. However, conventional knowledge-based and physiological biometric-based authentication systems (e.g., password, face recognition, and fingerprints) are susceptible to shoulder surfing attacks, smudge attacks, and heat attacks. The powerful sensing capabilities of IoT devices, including smartphones, wearables, robots, and autonomous vehicles enable continuous authentication (CA) based on behavioral biometrics. The artificial intelligence (AI) approaches hold significant promise in sifting through large volumes of heterogeneous biometrics data to offer unprecedented user authentication and user identification capabilities. In this survey article, we outline the nature of CA in IoT applications, highlight the key behavioral signals, and summarize the extant solutions from an AI perspective. Based on our systematic and comprehensive analysis, we discuss the challenges and promising future directions to guide the next generation of AI-based CA research.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9121981,IEEE Internet of Things Journal,2020
CANeleon: Protecting CAN Bus With Frame ID Chameleon,"The Controller Area Network (CAN) has been widely used in the automotive and industrial automation for over two decades. However, due to the lack of security mechanisms, CAN is vulnerable to attacks. In this paper, we propose a novel protection scheme called CANeleon. It can defend CAN against a smart attacker who might inject malicious frames with legitimate frame IDs, which cannot be mitigated by existing countermeasures. Inspired by the idea of moving target defense technologies, CANeleon equips each legitimate CAN node with the ability to shift the spoofed frame ID. In this way, the IDs of malicious frames are exposed and can be further filtered by legitimate nodes. Moreover, CANeleon neither inserts new information to the frame, nor requires any modification to the CAN protocol, so it is in compliance with the existing standards. CANeleon is a decentralized mechanism guaranteeing that the protection could be done simultaneously without additional communication. Experiments on a CAN bus prototype and a real self-driving vehicle prove the effectiveness of CANeleon.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9079183,IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology,2020
Fuzzy Static Output Feedback Control for Path Following of Autonomous Vehicles With Transient Performance Improvements,"This paper provides a new solution for path following control of autonomous ground vehicles. H2 control problem is considered to attenuate the effect of the road curvature disturbance. To this end, we formulate a standard model from the road-vehicle dynamics, the a priori knowledge on the road curvature, and the path following specifications. This standard model is then represented in a Takagi-Sugeno fuzzy form to deal with the time-varying nature of the vehicle speed. Based on a static output feedback scheme, the proposed method allows avoiding expensive vehicle sensors while keeping the simplest control structure for real-time implementation. The concept of V-stability is exploited using Lyapunov stability arguments to improve the transient behaviors of the closed-loop vehicle system. In particular, the physical upper and lower bounds of the vehicle acceleration are explicitly considered in the design procedure via a parameter-dependent Lyapunov function to reduce drastically the design conservatism. The proposed H2 design conditions are expressed in terms of linear matrix inequalities (LMIs) with a single line search parameter. The effectiveness of the new path following control method is clearly demonstrated with both theoretical illustrations and hardware experiments under realworld driving situations.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8759985,IEEE Transactions on Intelligent Transportation Systems,2020
A Robust Predictive Control Approach for Underwater Robotic Vehicles,"This article presents a robust nonlinear model predictive control (NMPC) scheme for autonomous navigation of underwater robotic vehicles operating in a constrained workspace including the static obstacles. In particular, the purpose of the controller is to guide the vehicle toward specific way points with guaranteed input and state constraints. Various constraints, such as obstacles, workspace boundaries, predefined upper bounds for the velocity of the robotic vehicle, and thruster saturations, are considered during the control design. Moreover, the proposed control scheme is designed at dynamic level, and it incorporates the full dynamics of the vehicle in which the ocean currents are also involved. Hence, taking the thrusts as the control inputs of the robotic system and formulating them accordingly, the vehicle exploits the ocean current dynamics when these are in favor of the way-point tracking mission, resulting in reduced energy consumption by the thrusters. The robustness of the closed-loop system against parameter uncertainties has been analytically guaranteed with convergence properties. The performance of the proposed control strategy is experimentally verified using a 4 degrees of freedom (DoF) underwater robotic vehicle inside a constrained test tank with sparse static obstacles.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8858028,IEEE Transactions on Control Systems Technology,2020
Adversarial Examples: Opportunities and Challenges,"Deep neural networks (DNNs) have shown huge superiority over humans in image recognition, speech processing, autonomous vehicles, and medical diagnosis. However, recent studies indicate that DNNs are vulnerable to adversarial examples (AEs), which are designed by attackers to fool deep learning models. Different from real examples, AEs can mislead the model to predict incorrect outputs while hardly be distinguished by human eyes, therefore threaten security-critical deep-learning applications. In recent years, the generation and defense of AEs have become a research hotspot in the field of artificial intelligence (AI) security. This article reviews the latest research progress of AEs. First, we introduce the concept, cause, characteristics, and evaluation metrics of AEs, then give a survey on the state-of-the-art AE generation methods with the discussion of advantages and disadvantages. After that, we review the existing defenses and discuss their limitations. Finally, future research opportunities and challenges on AEs are prospected.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8842604,IEEE Transactions on Neural Networks and Learning Systems,2020
Dynamic Attitude Planning for Trajectory Tracking in Thrust-Vectoring UAVs,"This paper addresses the trajectory tracking control problem for underactuated unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), with specific focus on vehicles with thrust-vectoring capabilities. According to the different actuation mechanisms, the most common UAV platforms can achieve only a partial decoupling of attitude and position tasks. Since position tracking is of utmost importance for applications involving aerial vehicles, we propose a control scheme in which position tracking is the primary objective. To this end, this paper exploits the concept of attitude planner, a dynamical system through which the desired attitude reference is processed to guarantee the satisfaction of the primary objective: The attitude tracking task is considered as a secondary objective, which can be realized as long as the desired trajectory satisfies specific trackability conditions.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8723556,IEEE Transactions on Automatic Control,2020
Multiview Scene Image Inpainting Based on Conditional Generative Adversarial Networks,"With the help of a multiview system, an unmanned vehicle system can better understand the surrounding environment and choose a more accurate and safer path to avoid obstacles. However, due to the interference of the signal or the loss of part of the signal during the acquisition, processing, compression, transmission and decompression of the video image signal, the local area of the image is abnormal, which affects the perception and decision of the system. This article addresses the problems of inaccurate restored images and noise in the restored images by proposing an image restoration method that is applied to a multicamera system. We utilize different perspective images captured by different cameras to assist and constrain the restoration of the damaged image. This method restores the image by combining sample representations and sample distribution models which respectively based on self-encoder reconstruction loss learning and generative adversarial networks. In this method, the infrastructure is a conditional generative adversarial network, the condition is the images that are from the other perspectives, and the generator is a self-encoder structure with cross-layer connection, group convolution and feature map channel exchanged. This method was carried out on a dataset recorded in Zurich using a pair of cameras mounted on a mobile platform. The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method is superior to the existing methods in terms of mean L1 Loss, mean L2 Loss and the peak signal to noise ratio (PSNR).",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8911481,IEEE Transactions on Intelligent Vehicles,2020
A Direct Position Determination Approach for Underwater Acoustic Sensor Networks,"In this paper, we consider the source localization problem with an underwater acoustic sensor network (UASN) consisting of a number of platforms each equipped with an array, such as an autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV). Direct position determination (DPD) has been a promising topic in recent years. Existing DPD methods can be divided into two categories: global coherent processing and non-coherent processing. The former is easy to implement in practical tasks but the coherence between the received signals at different nodes are not exploited, while the requirements for coherent processing may not be fulfilled in real environments. A multi-cluster array model is constructed considering the deployment of the nodes with the intention to exploit the available coherence in the UASN and avoiding the side effects of imperfect spatial coherence. A weighted MUSIC direct source localization approach is proposed based on this model. The arrays within a cluster work coherently as a large array and contribute a MUSIC spectrum. The final source position estimate is obtained from a weighted combination of these spectra, and the weights are dependent on the eigenstucture and noise variance of each cluster. We first investigate the theoretical gain of inter-array coherence exploitation on localization accuracy by means of Cramér-Rao bound analysis. Then the model for imperfect spatial coherence is generalized to the multi-cluster system to examine the performance of the proposed approach when the inherent constraints for intra-cluster coherent processing can not be guaranteed. Numerical results demonstrate the superior resolution capability of the proposed approach and its robustness to imperfect spatial coherence.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9173826,IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology,2020
Cabin and Battery Thermal Management of Connected and Automated HEVs for Improved Energy Efficiency Using Hierarchical Model Predictive Control,"Incorporating traffic information in power management optimization process for electrified and connected vehicles offers opportunities for improving fuel economy. Integrating the management of thermal load (such as those used for heating, ventilation, & air conditioning (HVAC) of the passenger compartment, and for the battery cooling) with the power management process can provide even greater benefits for connected and automated vehicles (CAVs). However, given the relatively slow dynamics associated with the thermal subsystems, the lack of reliable power and thermal loads prediction over an extended prediction horizon is the main challenge for efficient thermal management using model predictive control (MPC). This paper presents a hierarchical two-layer MPC scheme which exploits vehicle speed and traffic preview predictions over short and long prediction horizons to schedule optimal thermal trajectories for the cabin and battery cooling in hybrid electric vehicles (HEVs) via a novel intelligent online constraint handling (IOCH) approach. These trajectories are next incorporated into the vehicle-level controller to determine the proper power split between electric motor and internal combustion engine (ICE). We present the development and experimental validation of control-oriented models used for prediction of the vehicle thermal dynamics and loads over a long planning horizon. Compared to a more traditional single-layer MPC approach, the proposed two-layer MPC shows that depending on the driving cycle and traffic conditions, 2.2% to 5.3% reductions in HEV fuel consumption can be achieved for urban driving and congested city driving cycles, respectively, in CAV operation scenario. This fuel economy improvement is a direct result of taking proactive actions through real-time prediction and optimization to avoid conservative and inefficient thermal responses, while enforcing cabin and battery operating constraints.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8754762,IEEE Transactions on Control Systems Technology,2020
HDMI-Loc: Exploiting High Definition Map Image for Precise Localization via Bitwise Particle Filter,"In this letter, we propose a method for accurately estimating the 6-Degree Of Freedom (DOF) pose in an urban environment when a High Definition (HD) map is available. An HD map expresses 3D geometric data with semantic information in a compressed format and thus is more memory-efficient than point cloud maps. The small capacity of HD maps can be a significant advantage for autonomous vehicles in terms of map storage and updates within a large urban area. Unfortunately, existing approaches failed to sufficiently exploit HD maps by only estimating partial pose. In this study, we present a full 6-DOF localization against an HD map using an onboard stereo camera with semantic information from roads. We introduce an 8-bit representation for road information, which allow for effective bitwise operation when matching between query data and the HD map. For the pose estimation, we leverage a particle filter followed by a full 6-DOF pose optimization. Our experimental results show a median error of approximately 0.3 m in the lateral and longitudinal directions for a drive of approximately 11 km. These results can be used by autonomous vehicles to correct the global position without using Global Positioning System (GPS) data in highly complex urban environments. The median operation speed is approximately 60 msec supporting 10 Hz.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9158353,IEEE Robotics and Automation Letters,2020
Output-Feedback Image-Based Visual Servoing for Multirotor Unmanned Aerial Vehicle Line Following,"This article considers visual servoing-based motion control of multirotor unmanned aerial vehicles. We employ output feedback and image-based visual servoing to control the vehicle's pose with respect to a static planar visual target with a linear structure (e.g., electric transmission lines or pipelines). The method uses measurements from inexpensive sensors typically found on-board: an inertial measurement unit, and a monocular computer vision system. Unlike existing work, it does not require linear velocity, position measurements, or an optical flow sensor. The method directly controls the relative pose to the visual target and does not require global navigation satellite system measurements of the vehicle or target. The visual servoing method ensures the vehicle flies centered above the lines at specified height and yaw. Such motion control is important in a number of applications such as efficient data collection for infrastructure inspection. Our article exploits the inherent robustness of an image-based approach where feature error is computed directly in the image plane. A virtual camera is combined with output feedback and convergence of the closed loop is proven. The method is adaptive to vehicle mass, thrust constant, desired depth, and a constant disturbance force. Simulation and experimental results illustrate the method's performance and robustness to model uncertainty.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8962957,IEEE Transactions on Aerospace and Electronic Systems,2020
Real-Time Sensor Anomaly Detection and Identification in Automated Vehicles,"Connected and automated vehicles (CAVs) are expected to revolutionize the transportation industry, mainly through allowing for a real-time and seamless exchange of information between vehicles and roadside infrastructure. Although connectivity and automation are projected to bring about a vast number of benefits, they can give rise to new challenges in terms of safety, security, and privacy. To navigate roadways, CAVs need to heavily rely on their sensor readings and the information received from other vehicles and roadside units. Hence, anomalous sensor readings caused by either malicious cyber attacks or faulty vehicle sensors can result in disruptive consequences and possibly lead to fatal crashes. As a result, before the mass implementation of CAVs, it is important to develop methodologies that can detect anomalies and identify their sources seamlessly and in real time. In this paper, we develop an anomaly detection approach through combining a deep learning method, namely convolutional neural network (CNN), with a well-established anomaly detection method, and Kalman filtering with a  $\chi ^{2}$ -detector, to detect and identify anomalous behavior in CAVs. Our numerical experiments demonstrate that the developed approach can detect anomalies and identify their sources with high accuracy, sensitivity, and F1 score. In addition, this developed approach outperforms the anomaly detection and identification capabilities of both CNNs and Kalman filtering with a  $\chi ^{2}$ -detector method alone. It is envisioned that this research will contribute to the development of safer and more resilient CAV systems that implement a holistic view toward intelligent transportation system (ITS) concepts.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8684317,IEEE Transactions on Intelligent Transportation Systems,2020
SEARCH: An SDN-Enabled Approach for Vehicle Path-Planning,"With increasing vehicle density and the growth of accidents in urban areas, navigation management becomes a serious problem. Even though there is a multitude of navigation systems, ambulances, taxis, or even ordinary vehicles, sometimes find it challenging to reach their destinations on time. There are two main reasons for this difficulty: (i) lack of local knowledge of the area of navigation solutions and (ii) their inflexibility against unforeseeable situations that may occur on the roads. Indeed, the majority of navigation solutions are based only on the distance, the journey time, or even statistics related to the density of vehicles to plan the full paths, while neglecting the dynamic nature of the vehicle traffic. Also, their respective centralized architectures are unable to monitor both the traffic and unexpected events continuously and in real-time without not being overloaded by the flow of message exchanges between the road entities and the central processing entity. To address these issues, we propose in this paper a novel three-tier architecture, called SDN-enabled Approach for Vehicle Path-Planning (SEARCH), to enhance the situation awareness on urban roads, efficiently collect traffic information in real-time, and decide the best navigation strategy. The proposed architecture exploits Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs), Vehicular Ad hoc Networks (VANETs), 5G based cellular systems, and Software-Defined Networking (SDN) to provide better and faster communication to changing road conditions. Based on these technologies, some parameters related to vehicles and driving environments, such as speed, distance, traffic jams, incidents, and travel flow, are efficiently collected and dynamically exploited to achieve faster paths between any existing pairs of locations. Furthermore, the deployed architecture of SEARCH can provide sufficient bandwidth to support all data traffic needs to update vehicles during their journey efficiently and in real-time. To evaluate the performance of our architecture, we conduct a series of simulations and perform a set of comparisons with relevant route planning algorithms. We found that the proposed architecture works effectively in terms of saving on driving time to reach any target destinations.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9286572,IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology,2020
Deep reinforcement learning and its application in autonomous fitting optimization for attack areas of UCAVs,"The ever-changing battlefield environment requires the use of robust and adaptive technologies integrated into a reliable platform. Unmanned combat aerial vehicles (UCAVs) aim to integrate such advanced technologies while increasing the tactical capabilities of combat aircraft. As a research object, common UCAV uses the neural network fitting strategy to obtain values of attack areas. However, this simple strategy cannot cope with complex environmental changes and autonomously optimize decision-making problems. To solve the problem, this paper proposes a new deep deterministic policy gradient (DDPG) strategy based on deep reinforcement learning for the attack area fitting of UCAVs in the future battlefield. Simulation results show that the autonomy and environmental adaptability of UCAVs in the future battlefield will be improved based on the new DDPG algorithm and the training process converges quickly. We can obtain the optimal values of attack areas in real time during the whole flight with the well-trained deep network.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9180140,Journal of Systems Engineering and Electronics,2020
Malicious User Detection for Cooperative Mobility Tracking in Autonomous Driving,"The mobility status of self and surrounding vehicles provides important information to various tasks in autonomous driving (AD) and intelligent transportation system (ITS). Accordingly, a precise, stable, and robust mobility tracking framework is essential. Compared with self-tracking that relies only on mobility observations from onboard sensors [e.g., global positioning system (GPS), inertial measurement unit (IMU), and camera], cooperative tracking markedly increases the precision and reliability of the mobility information by integrating observations from roadside units (RSUs) and nearby vehicles through vehicle-to-everything (V2X) communications in the Internet of Vehicles (IoV). Nevertheless, cooperative tracking can be quite vulnerable if there are malicious users sending bogus observations in the cooperative network. In this article, we present a malicious user detection framework, which includes two sequential detection algorithms and a secure mobility data exchange and fusion model to detect and remove bogus mobility information and integrate proposed detection algorithms with previous data fusion algorithms, which secures the cooperative mobility tracking in AD, ITS. Simulations validate the effectiveness and robustness of the proposed framework under different types of attacks.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8998259,IEEE Internet of Things Journal,2020
Optimal Stealthy Deception Attack Against Cyber-Physical Systems,"This paper studies the problem of designing the optimal deception attack to maximize a utility function with the Kullback-Leibler divergence adopted as a detection constraint. The utility function reflects the goal of pulling the state away from the origin, increasing the cost of the controller and decreasing the cost of the attacker. To analyze the stealthiness of the attack, the attack signal is decomposed into two parts, one of which is strict stealthy. The necessary and sufficient condition is derived for the case that the strict stealthy attack cannot lead to an unbounded benefit. In this case, the linear transformation of the optimal attack is proved to be a Gaussian distribution. With the mean value and covariance of the Gaussian distribution as variables, the original problem is transformed into a new problem which may not be convex. A suboptimal attack policy is provided and the upper bound for the loss of benefit when using the suboptimal attack is also given. A numerical example of unmanned ground vehicle is illustrated to verify the effectiveness of the proposed attack policy.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8709954,IEEE Transactions on Cybernetics,2020
Resilient Output Containment of Heterogeneous Cooperative and Adversarial Multigroup Systems,"This note introduces a new concept of cooperative and adversarial multigroup system, which consists of cooperative leaders and followers, as well as adversaries. For example, cooperation of multiple military vehicles operate in complex dynamic networked environments with unknown enemies and hidden malicious attackers. The lack of global situational awareness in distributed settings makes autonomous vehicles prone to cyberattacks and infiltration. Each agent is unaware of the motives of its neighbors and may receive information/data from both the teammates and the adversaries. Secure and resilient control protocols are essential for the networked multigroup systems to prevent the adversaries' attacks from propagating across the network, which may influence the system performance and even overall stability. To counter sensor faults and attacks from the adversaries, a distributed resilient control architecture is proposed, which guarantees uniform ultimate boundedness of the closed-loop dynamical system. Numerical simulations illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed results.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8869852,IEEE Transactions on Automatic Control,2020
SecAuthUAV: A Novel Authentication Scheme for UAV-Ground Station and UAV-UAV Communication,"Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) are becoming very popular nowadays due to the emergence of application areas such as the Internet of Drones (IoD). They are finding wide applicability in areas ranging from package delivery systems to automated military applications. Nevertheless, communication security between a UAV and its ground station (GS) is critical for completing its task without leaking sensitive information either to the adversaries or to unauthenticated users. UAVs are especially vulnerable to physical capture and node tampering attacks. Further, since UAV devices are generally equipped with small batteries and limited memory storage, lightweight security techniques are best suited for them. Addressing these issues, a lightweight mutual authentication scheme based on Physical Unclonable Functions (PUFs) for UAV-GS authentication is presented in this paper. The UAV-GS authentication scheme is extended further to support UAV-UAV authentication. We present a formal security analysis as well as old-fashioned cryptanalysis and show that our protocol provides various security features such as mutual authentication, user anonymity, etc, and is resilient against many security attacks such as masquerade, replay, node tampering, and cloning attacks, etc. We also compare the performance of our protocol with state-of-the-art authentication protocols for UAVs, based on computation, communication, and memory storage cost.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9237145,IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology,2020
Detection Performance to Spatially Random UAV Using the Ground Vehicle,"It is very challenging to detect an unmanned-aerial-vehicle (UAV) when it is applied to launch an attack by the enemy's country, due to its feature of mobility and flexibility. Against this background, in this paper, from wireless communication point of view, we study the detection probability of home country's ground vehicle (GV) to enemy's ground-station (GS)-to-UAV transmission system. We assume that the location of the GV is randomly distributed inside the space confined by the largest detection distance. Moreover, we assume the enemy's UAV is randomly distributed in the coverage space of the GS-to-UAV (G2A) transmission link but also keep the security distance from the GS. To this end, we first characterize the statistical features of the signal-to-noise-ratio (SNR) over the G2V and G2A links. Then, we define detection outage probability (DOP) and average detection capacity (ADC), and show their approximations. Finally, Monte-Carlo simulations are conducted to verify the correctness of our proposed analytical models.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9293404,IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology,2020

Real-Time Fusion Network for RGB-D Semantic Segmentation Incorporating Unexpected Obstacle Detection for Road-Driving Images,"Semantic segmentation has made striking progress due to the success of deep convolutional neural networks. Considering the demands of autonomous driving, real-time semantic segmentation has become a research hotspot these years. However, few real-time RGB-D fusion semantic segmentation studies are carried out despite readily accessible depth information nowadays. In this letter, we propose a real-time fusion semantic segmentation network termed RFNet that effectively exploits complementary cross-modal information. Building on an efficient network architecture, RFNet is capable of running swiftly, which satisfies autonomous vehicles applications. Multi-dataset training is leveraged to incorporate unexpected small obstacle detection, enriching the recognizable classes required to face unforeseen hazards in the real world. A comprehensive set of experiments demonstrates the effectiveness of our framework. On Cityscapes, Our method outperforms previous state-of-the-art semantic segmenters, with excellent accuracy and 22 Hz inference speed at the full 2048 × 1024 resolution, outperforming most existing RGB-D networks.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9134735,IEEE Robotics and Automation Letters,2020
The Safety Potential of Lane Keeping Assistance and Possible Actions to Improve the Potential,"Before widespread automated driving, driver assistance systems become more common and can deliver safety benefits. This study focuses on current and future lane keeping assistance (LKA) systems and their potential safety effects by analysing real-world crash data and LKA's possibilities to prevent fatal passenger car crashes. The analysed data includes in-depth analysis of 364 fatal head-on and single-vehicle crashes in Finland. According to statistical analysis, 27% of these crashes could potentially have been prevented had currently available LKA been deployed. In this study, many issues are examined related to the lane markings' visibility, infrastructure, weather, and driver-related risks, which rationalise the results, compliment previous research, and highlight possibilities to increase the safety potential of LKA. Related to the lane markings' visibility, safety potential could be improved by allocating more resources to road maintenance and to snow clearance. Advanced LKA enabling exploiting digital lane markings could hypothetically almost double the safety potential as weather conditions or the visibility of lane markings would not restrict LKA's operation. While the driver is still in charge of driving tasks, driver-related risks are difficult to manage and the crashes caused intendedly or due to driver's attack of illness are not preventable by current LKA systems.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9084279,IEEE Transactions on Intelligent Vehicles,2020
"Exploiting Singular Configurations for Controllable, Low-Power Friction Enhancement on Unmanned Ground Vehicles","This letter describes the design, validation, and performance of a new type of adaptive wheel morphology for unmanned ground vehicles. Our adaptive wheel morphology uses a spiral cam to create a system that enables controllable deployment of high friction surfaces. The overall design is modular, battery powered, and can be mounted directly to the wheels of a vehicle without additional wiring. The use of a tailored cam profile exploits a singular configuration to minimize power consumption when deployed and protects the actuator from external forces. Component-level experiments demonstrate that friction on ice and grass can be increased by up to 170%. Two prototypes were installed on a 1:5 scale, radio-controlled rally car and tested. The devices were able to controllably deploy, increase friction, and greatly improve acceleration capacity on a slippery, synthetic ice surface.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9017955,IEEE Robotics and Automation Letters,2020
An Integrated Threat Assessment Algorithm for Decision-Making of Autonomous Driving Vehicles,"In order to decide a safe and reliable trajectory for autonomous driving vehicles, the threat of surrounding vehicles need to be assessed quantitatively and consider the potential risk. This paper proposes a novel integrated threat assessment algorithm for the decision-making system. First, the motion of the surrounding vehicle is predicted probabilistic based on the interact multiple model (IMM) to consider the potential threat. Then, we build an integrated threat assessment function to assess the threat in each state quantitatively and objectively, which synthesizes the existing time-to-collision (TTC), time-headway (TH), and the original proposed time-to-front (TTF). Based on this, the decision-making system is established according to the Markov decision process (MDP) and the feedback value of each decision sequence is calculated by the integrated threat assessment function, thus the safest trajectory for the current moment can be determined by optimal search. Finally, the decision-making system is verified in the overtaking and cut-in scenario by Carsim and Simulink co-simulation. The results show that the proposed threat assessment algorithm for the decision-making system can help autonomous vehicles decide a safe trajectory in real-time and maintain good maneuverability.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8753708,IEEE Transactions on Intelligent Transportation Systems,2020
DiversityGAN: Diversity-Aware Vehicle Motion Prediction via Latent Semantic Sampling,"Vehicle trajectory prediction is crucial for autonomous driving and advanced driver assistant systems. While existing approaches may sample from a predicted distribution of vehicle trajectories, they lack the ability to explore it – a key ability for evaluating safety from a planning and verification perspective. In this work, we devise a novel approach for generating realistic and diverse vehicle trajectories. We first extend the generative adversarial network (GAN) framework with a low-dimensional approximate semantic space, and shape that space to capture semantics such as merging and turning. We then sample from this space in a way that mimics the predicted distribution, but allows us to control coverage of semantically distinct outcomes. We validate our approach on a publicly available dataset and show results that achieve state-of-the-art prediction performance, while providing improved coverage of the space of predicted trajectory semantics.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9127831,IEEE Robotics and Automation Letters,2020
Pricing Data Tampering in Automated Fare Collection with NFC-Equipped Smartphones,"Automated Fare Collection (AFC) systems have been globally deployed for decades, particularly in the public transportation network where the transit fee is calculated based on the length of the trip (a.k.a., distance-based pricing AFC systems). Although most messages of AFC systems are insecurely transferred in plaintext, system operators did not pay much attention to this vulnerability, since the AFC network is basically isolated from the public network (e.g., the Internet)-there is no way of exploiting such a vulnerability from the outside of the AFC network. Nevertheless, in recent years, the advent of Near Field Communication (NFC)-equipped smartphones has opened up a channel to invade into the AFC network from the mobile Internet, i.e., by Host-based Card Emulation (HCE) over NFC-equipped smartphones. In this paper, we identify a novel paradigm of attacks, called LessPay, against modern distance-based pricing AFC systems, enabling users to pay much less than what they are supposed to be charged. The identified attack has two important properties: 1) it is invisible to AFC system operators because the attack never causes any inconsistency in the back-end database of the operators; and 2) it can be scalable to affect a large number of users (e.g., 10,000) by only requiring a moderate-sized AFC card pool (e.g., containing 150 cards). To evaluate the efficacy of the attack, we developed an HCE app to launch the LessPay attack; and the real-world experiments demonstrate not only the feasibility of the LessPay attack (with 97.6 percent success rate) but also its low cost in terms of bandwidth and computation. Finally, we propose, implement and evaluate four types of countermeasures, and present security analysis and comparison of these countermeasures on defending against the LessPay attack.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8404117,IEEE Transactions on Mobile Computing,2019
A Robust Load Balancing and Routing Protocol for Intra-Car Hybrid Wired/Wireless Networks,"With the emergence of connected and autonomous vehicles, sensors are increasingly deployed within cars to support new functionalities. Traffic generated by these sensors congest traditional intra-car networks, such as CAN buses. Furthermore, the large amount of wires needed to connect sensors makes it harder to design cars in a modular way. To alleviate these limitations, we propose, simulate, and implement a hybrid wired/wireless architecture, in which each node is connected to either a wired interface or a wireless interface or both. Specifically, we propose a new protocol, called Hybrid-Backpressure Collection Protocol (Hybrid-BCP), to efficiently collect data from sensors in intra-car networks. Hybrid-BCP is backward-compatible with the CAN bus technology, and builds on the BCP protocol, designed for wireless sensor networks. We theoretically prove that an idealized version of Hybrid-BCP achieves optimal throughput. Our testbed implementation, based on CAN and ZigBee transceivers, demonstrates the load balancing and routing functionalities of Hybrid-BCP and its resilience to DoS attacks and wireless jamming attacks. We further provide simulation results, obtained with the ns-3 simulator and based on real intra-car RSSI traces, that compare between the performance of Hybrid-BCP and a tree-based data collection protocol. Notably, the simulations show that Hybrid-BCP outperforms the tree-based protocol on throughput by 12 percent. The results also show that Hybrid-BCP maintains high packet delivery rate and low packet delay for safety-critical sensors that are directly connected to the sink through wire.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8353355,IEEE Transactions on Mobile Computing,2019
Road Segmentation of Unmanned Aerial Vehicle Remote Sensing Images Using Adversarial Network With Multiscale Context Aggregation,"Semantic segmentation using adversarial networks has proved to be effective in image processing fields. However, two problems need to be solved in the field of the road segmentation of unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) remote sensing images. One is the occupied proportion of road area in UAV remote sensing images; the other is that the constant size of convolutional kernel cannot deal with multiscale feature very well. To solve these two problems, this paper proposed a road segmentation model that combined the adversarial networks with multiscale context aggregation. First, the output feature-maps of three scales (0.5n, 1n, 2n) were obtained, based on an end-to-end training from image segmentation network. Second, after the convolution and deconvolution operations, the processed images were unified to the size scale of original images. Third, with the pixel-by-pixel addition method, the three scales of image feature (0.5n, 1n, 2n) were merged together, then inputted into the discriminative network. Finally, the errors were obtained and propagated backwards compared with the label, and then the parameters of a generative network and a discriminative network could be updated. Further, the segmented results were compared with those from normal adversarial networks, Linknet and D-linknet, and were developed with the morphological operation. The research results show that the proposed model can improve the precision of road segmentation from UAV images with multiscale context aggregation and the regularization property of adversarial networks.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8700287,IEEE Journal of Selected Topics in Applied Earth Observations and Remote Sensing,2019
Optimal Utility of Vehicles in LTE-V Scenario: An Immune Clone-Based Spectrum Allocation Approach,"With the surge service requirements from vehicular users, especially for automated driving, providing real-time high-rate wireless connections to fast-moving vehicles is ever demanding. This motivates the development of the emerging LTE-V network, a 5G cellular-based vehicular technology. However, note that the vehicular user group is typically of a very large scale, whereas the bandwidth spectrum available for vehicular communications is very limited. To efficiently allocate and utilize the slim spectrum resource to vehicle users are therefore important. This paper develops a service priority oriented spectrum allocation scheme in an LTE-V network, which explores the features of vehicular networks toward economic yet QoS guaranteed spectrum allocation. Specifically, the work exploits two features of the vehicular networks. First, vehicles in the proximity typically have similar information requirements, e.g., road conditions. As a result, the location-based multicast (i.e., geocast) could be applied to save the spectrum. Second, different types of vehicles, e.g., ambulances, buses, and private cars, are of different bandwidth and service requirements. Therefore, differential services and spectrum allocations should be applied. By jointly considering the above features, we develop a 2-D service importance oriented framework for LTE-V network spectrum allocations. The spectrum allocation issue is finally modeled as a mixed integer programming problem to maximize the system utility, and solved using an immune clonal based algorithm. The convergence of the proposed algorithm is proved, and using numerical results, we show that our proposal can outperform the typical heuristics-based spectrum resource allocation in terms of convergence and average delay.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8421070,IEEE Transactions on Intelligent Transportation Systems,2019
Cooperative Trajectory Planning for Haptic Shared Control Between Driver and Automation in Highway Driving,"This paper addresses the driver-automation shared driving control for lane keeping and obstacle avoidance of automated vehicles in highway traffic. The proposed shared control framework is established from a novel cooperative trajectory planning algorithm and a fuzzy steering controller. Based on polynomial functions, the cooperative trajectory planning is formulated by judiciously exploiting the information on the maneuver decision, the conflict management, and the driver monitoring. As a result, the planned trajectory of the vehicle is continuously adapted according to the driver's actions and intentions. By means of Lyapunov stability arguments, sufficient conditions in terms of linear matrix inequalities are given to design a Takagi-Sugeno fuzzy model-based controller. This robust steering controller provides a necessary assistive torque to track the planned vehicle trajectory. The new shared driving control framework allows reducing effectively the driver-automation conflict issue while offering the driver more freedom to swerve within a predefined lane. The advantages of the proposed approach are evaluated using both objective and subjective results, experimentally obtained from several human drivers and an advanced interactive dynamic driving simulator.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8624569,IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics,2019
The Foldable Drone: A Morphing Quadrotor That Can Squeeze and Fly,"The recent advances in state estimation, perception, and navigation algorithms have significantly contributed to the ubiquitous use of quadrotors for inspection, mapping, and aerial imaging. To further increase the versatility of quadrotors, recent works investigated the use of an adaptive morphology, which consists of modifying the shape of the vehicle during flight to suit a specific task or environment. However, these works either increase the complexity of the platform or decrease its controllability. In this letter, we propose a novel, simpler, yet effective morphing design for quadrotors consisting of a frame with four independently rotating arms that fold around the main frame. To guarantee stable flight at all times, we exploit an optimal control strategy that adapts on the fly to the drone morphology. We demonstrate the versatility of the proposed adaptive morphology in different tasks, such as negotiation of narrow gaps, close inspection of vertical surfaces, and object grasping and transportation. The experiments are performed on an actual, fully autonomous quadrotor relying solely on onboard visual-inertial sensors and compute. No external motion tracking systems and computers are used. This is the first work showing stable flight without requiring any symmetry of the morphology.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8567932,IEEE Robotics and Automation Letters,2019
Parallel planning: a new motion planning framework for autonomous driving,"Motion planning is one of the most significant technologies for autonomous driving. To make motion planning models able to learn from the environment and to deal with emergency situations, a new motion planning framework called as “ parallel planning ” is proposed in this paper. In order to generate sufficient and various training samples, artificial traffic scenes are firstly constructed based on the knowledge from the reality. A deep planning model which combines a convolutional neural network ( CNN ) with the Long Short-Term Memory module ( LSTM ) is developed to make planning decisions in an end-to-end mode. This model can learn from both real and artificial traffic scenes and imitate the driving style of human drivers. Moreover, a parallel deep reinforcement learning approach is also presented to improve the robustness of planning model and reduce the error rate. To handle emergency situations, a hybrid generative model including a variational auto-encoder ( VAE ) and a generative adversarial network ( GAN ) is utilized to learn from virtual emergencies generated in artificial traffic scenes. While an autonomous vehicle is moving, the hybrid generative model generates multiple video clips in parallel, which correspond to different potential emergency scenarios. Simultaneously, the deep planning model makes planning decisions for both virtual and current real scenes. The final planning decision is determined by analysis of real observations. Leveraging the parallel planning approach, the planner is able to make rational decisions without heavy calculation burden when an emergency occurs.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8405356,IEEE/CAA Journal of Automatica Sinica,2019

The different theoretical algorithms are finally discussed in terms of computational complexity, robustness, and most suited applications.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8574961,IEEE Transactions on Intelligent Vehicles,2019
Blockchain-Based Mutual-Healing Group Key Distribution Scheme in Unmanned Aerial Vehicles Ad-Hoc Network,"A dynamic group key is required for secure communication in the Unmanned Aerial Vehicles Ad-Hoc Network (UAANET). However, due to the unreliable wireless channel and high-dynamic topology of UAANET, the situation that a node is missing certain group key broadcast messages occurs frequently. Existing group key distribution schemes cannot be directly applied to the UAANET, because of their poor security or real-time. Therefore, we present a mutual-healing group key distribution scheme based on the blockchain. Firstly, the Ground Control Station (GCS) builds a private blockchain where the group keys distributed by GCS are recorded. Meanwhile, through the blockchain, a dynamic list of UAANET membership certificates is also managed. According to different attack models, a basic mutual-healing protocol and an enhanced one are designed based on the Longest-Lost-Chain mechanism to recover the node's lost group keys with the aid of its neighbors. Security analysis and extensive experiments show that, compared with the existing mutual-healing schemes, our proposed solution can effectively resist various attacks with small overhead on time and storage.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8846098,IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology,2019
Toward Privacy-Preserving Valet Parking in Autonomous Driving Era,"Automated valet parking, deemed as a key milestone on the way to autonomous driving, has great potential to improve the “last-mile” driving experience for users. On the other hand, it triggers serious risks on vehicle theft and location privacy leakage. To address these issues, we propose a secure and privacy-preserving automated valet parking protocol for self-driving vehicles. The proposed protocol is characterized by extending anonymous authentication to support two-factor authentication with mutual traceability for reducing the risks of vehicle theft and preventing the privacy leakage of users in automated valet parking. Specifically, based on one-time password and secure mobile devices, two-factor authentication is achieved between vehicles and smartphones to ensure vehicle security in remote pickup. By exploiting the BBS+ signature and the Cuckoo filter, user location privacy is protected against the curious parking lots and service providers. In addition, the traceable tags are designed to enable a trusted authority to identify the vehicles and users for localizing a stolen or missing vehicle and preventing the slandering of greedy users. Finally, formal security analysis on the proposed protocol is given to show that the authentication, anonymity, and traceability can be reduced to standard hard assumptions, and performance evaluation demonstrates the proposed protocol is efficient and practical to be implemented in autonomous driving era.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8624339,IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology,2019
"Decision-Making Framework for Autonomous Driving at Road Intersections: Safeguarding Against Collision, Overly Conservative Behavior, and Violation Vehicles","In this paper, we propose a decision-making framework for autonomous driving at road intersections that determines appropriate maneuvers for an autonomous vehicle to navigate an intersection safely and efficiently (regarding making progress), even in the face of violation vehicles-one of the most challenging tasks in the domain of autonomous vehicles. The proposed framework uses a digital map to predict future paths of observed vehicles and then uses the predicted future paths to identify potential threats (vehicles) and collision areas, regardless of whether observed vehicles are obeying traffic rules at the intersection. Next, under an independent and distributed reasoning structure, it systematically, reliably, and robustly assesses the potential threats, even under incomplete and uncertain noise data, by way of a threat measure, Bayesian networks, and time window filtering. It then uses this information to determine appropriate maneuvers for the autonomous vehicle to navigate the intersection safely and efficiently. We have tested and evaluated the proposed framework through in-vehicle testing on a closed urban test road under traffic conditions inclusive of nonviolation and violation vehicles. In-vehicle testing results show the performance of the proposed framework to be sufficiently reliable for autonomous driving at intersections regarding reliability, robustness, safety, and efficiency.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8370800,IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics,2019
"Learning Driver Braking Behavior Using Smartphones, Neural Networks and the Sliding Correlation Coefficient: Road Anomaly Case Study","This paper focuses on the automated learning of driver braking “signature” in the presence of road anomalies. Our motivation is to improve driver experience using preview information from navigation maps. Smartphones facilitate, due to their unprecedented market penetration, the large-scale deployment of advanced driver assistance systems. On the other hand, it is challenging to exploit smartphone sensor data because of the fewer and lower quality signals, compared to the ones on board. Methods for detecting braking behavior using smartphones exist, however, most of them focus only on harsh events. Additionally, only a few studies correlate longitudinal driving behavior with the road condition. In this paper, a new method, based on deep neural networks and the sliding correlation coefficient, is proposed for the spatio-temporal correlation of road anomalies and driver behavior. A unique deep neural network structure, that requires minimum tuning, is proposed. Extensive field trials were conducted and vehicle motion was recorded using smartphones and a data acquisition system, comprising an inertial measurement unit and differential GPS. The proposed method was validated using the probabilistic Receiver Operating Characteristics method. The method proves to be a robust and flexible tool for self-learning driver behavior.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8294049,IEEE Transactions on Intelligent Transportation Systems,2019
iSTRICT: An Interdependent Strategic Trust Mechanism for the Cloud-Enabled Internet of Controlled Things,"The cloud-enabled Internet of controlled things (IoCT) envisions a network of sensors, controllers, and actuators connected through a local cloud in order to intelligently control physical devices. Because cloud services are vulnerable to advanced persistent threats (APTs), each device in the IoCT must strategically decide whether to trust cloud services that may be compromised. In this paper, we present iSTRICT, an interdependent strategic trust mechanism for the cloud-enabled IoCT. iSTRICT is composed of three interdependent layers. In the cloud layer, iSTRICT uses FlipIt games to conceptualize APTs. In the communication layer, it captures the interaction between devices and the cloud using signaling games. In the physical layer, iSTRICT uses optimal control to quantify the utilities in the higher level games. Best response dynamics link the three layers in an overall “game-of-games,” for which the outcome is captured by a concept called Gestalt Nash equilibrium (GNE). We prove the existence of a GNE under a set of natural assumptions and develop an adaptive algorithm to iteratively compute the equilibrium. Finally, we apply iSTRICT to trust management for autonomous vehicles that rely on measurements from remote sources. We show that strategic trust in the communication layer achieves a worst-case probability of compromise for any attack and defense costs in the cyber layer.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8543871,IEEE Transactions on Information Forensics and Security,2019
Covert Spoofing Algorithm of UAV Based on GPS/INS-Integrated Navigation,"A covert spoofing algorithm of an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) based on GPS/inertial-navigation-system-integrated navigation is analyzed in this paper. The proposed algorithm theoretically proves the fact that when the acceleration component of the counterfeit GPS signal is the difference between the UAV's current acceleration and the spoofing control input, the UAV can be covert spoofed. To avoid adverse consequences (detection or crash) caused by frequent changes in UAV flight during the GPS spoofing attacks, the proposed algorithm requires that the deception trajectory planned by the GPS spoofer is slowly changing relative to the reference trajectory, which is pre-set by the UAV. Simulation results have verified the correctness of the proposed covert spoofing algorithm of UAV. Moreover, the spoofing effect is more distinct when the deception trajectory planning is considered.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8704896,IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology,2019
A Trust-Based Active Detection for Cyber-Physical Security in Industrial Environments,"For the cyber-physical systems (CPS) in the smart industrial environments, a larger amount of smart sensor nodes, processors and actuators are deployed to sense information from physical world, which is vulnerable to be attacked because the nodes are deployed in unattended areas. Security is a pivotal issue for CPS, therefore, a trust-based active detection (TBAD) scheme is proposed for improving the reliability of collecting data packets and reducing the data redundancy. In TBAD scheme, the trust of the nodes is evaluated by the neighboring nodes and the evaluation results are added into the header of data packets. Thus, according to the reliability of data packets collected by the unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV), the trust of sensor nodes is evaluated by the UAV. In addition, the evaluation trust of nodes stored in the header of data packets will be detected when the UAV suspects the stored trust of sensor nodes. Then, the trust of corresponding sensor nodes is adjusted according to the detection results. The sensor nodes with higher trust are selected to form movement trajectory. A series of simulation experiments are conducted to evaluate the performance of the scheme. The results illustrate that the proposed scheme can greatly improve the efficiency and security of data routing in CPS.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8787570,IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics,2019
Design and Evaluation of UAV Flow Angle Estimation Filters,"This paper presents the design, implementation, and evaluation of four filters for the estimation of angle of attack (AOA) and angle of sideslip (AOS) of small unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs). Specifically, two novel filters (a complementary filter and an extended Kalman filter) are proposed and evaluated without using direct flow angle and Global Positioning System measurements; two existing AOA/AOS filters are also implemented and evaluated. All filters are designed with minimal inputs and states to ensure the ease of implementation, simplicity of tuning, and computation efficiency. Both simulation and UAV flight test results show the performance of the proposed filters. Especially, flight test results from two different UAVs (a T-tail UAV and a flying wing UAV) show that the root mean square errors of estimated inertial AOA and AOS are less than 1.5° under nominal flight conditions and around 2° under aggressive maneuvers compared with direct flow angle measurements.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8401906,IEEE Transactions on Aerospace and Electronic Systems,2019
Learning to Communicate in UAV-Aided Wireless Networks: Map-Based Approaches,"We consider a scenario where an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV)-mounted flying base station is providing data communication services to a number of radio nodes spread over the ground. We focus on the problem of resource-constrained UAV trajectory design with: 1) optimal channel parameters learning and 2) optimal data throughput as key objectives, respectively. While the problem of throughput optimized trajectories has been addressed in prior works, the formulation of an optimized trajectory to efficiently discover the propagation parameters has not yet been addressed. When it comes to the communication phase, the advantage of this paper comes from the exploitation of a 3-D city map. Unfortunately, the communication trajectory design based on the raw map data leads to an intractable optimization problem. To solve this issue, we introduce a map compression method that allows us to tackle the problem with standard optimization tools. The trajectory optimization is then combined with a node scheduling algorithm. The advantages of the learning-optimized trajectory and of the map compression method are illustrated in the context of intelligent Internet of Things data harvesting.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8525324,IEEE Internet of Things Journal,2019
Localization and Clustering Based on Swarm Intelligence in UAV Networks for Emergency Communications,"In recent years, unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) networks have been a focus area of the academic and industrial research community. They have been used in many military and civilian applications. Emergency communication is one of the essential requirements for first responders and victims in the aftermath of natural disasters. In such scenarios, UAVs may configure ad hoc wireless networks to cover a large area. In UAV networks, however, localization and routing are challenging tasks owing to the high mobility, unstable links, dynamic topology, and limited energy of UAVs. Here, we propose swarm-intelligence-based localization (SIL) and clustering schemes in UAV networks for emergency communications. First, we propose a new 3-D SIL algorithm based on particle swarm optimization (PSO) that exploits the particle search space in a limited boundary by using the bounding box method. In the 3-D search space, anchor UAV nodes are randomly distributed and the SIL algorithm measures the distance to existing anchor nodes for estimating the location of the target UAV nodes. Convergence time and localization accuracy are improved with lower computational cost. Second, we propose an energy-efficient swarm-intelligence-based clustering (SIC) algorithm based on PSO, in which the particle fitness function is exploited for intercluster distance, intracluster distance, residual energy, and geographic location. For energy-efficient clustering, cluster heads are selected based on improved particle optimization. The proposed SIC outperforms five typical routing protocols regarding packet delivery ratio, average end-to-end delay, and routing overhead. Moreover, SIC consumes less energy and prolongs network lifetime.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8750806,IEEE Internet of Things Journal,2019
An Empirical Air-to-Ground Channel Model Based on Passive Measurements in LTE,"In this paper, a recently conducted measurement campaign for unmanned-aerial-vehicle channels is introduced. The downlink signals of an in-service long-time-evolution network, which is deployed in a suburban scenario were acquired. Five horizontal and five vertical flight routes were considered. The channel impulse responses (CIRs) are extracted from the received data by exploiting the cell-specific signals, and the underlying physical propagation mechanisms are interpreted by exploiting the propagation graph modeling approach. Based on the CIRs, the parameters of multipath components are estimated by using a high-resolution algorithm derived according to the space-alternating generalized expectation-maximization (SAGE) principle.

Throughput Maximization for UAV-Enabled Wireless Powered Communication Networks,"This paper studies an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV)-enabled wireless powered communication network (WPCN), in which a UAV is dispatched as a mobile access point (AP) to serve a set of ground users periodically. The UAV employs the radio frequency (RF) wireless power transfer (WPT) to charge the users in the downlink, and the users use the harvested RF energy to send independent information to the UAV in the uplink. Unlike the conventional WPCN with fixed APs, the UAV-enabled WPCN can exploit the mobility of the UAV via trajectory design, jointly with the wireless resource allocation optimization, to maximize the system throughput. In particular, we aim to maximize the uplink common (minimum) throughput among all ground users over a finite UAV's flight period, subject to its maximum speed constraint and the users' energy neutrality constraints. The resulted problem is nonconvex and thus difficult to be solved optimally. To tackle this challenge, we first consider an ideal case without the UAV's maximum speed constraint, and obtain the optimal solution to the relaxed problem. The optimal solution shows that the UAV should successively hover above a finite number of ground locations for downlink WPT, as well as above each of the ground users for uplink communication. Next, we consider the general problem with the UAV's maximum speed constraint. Based on the above multilocation-hovering solution, we first propose an efficient successive hover-and-fly trajectory design, jointly with the downlink and uplink wireless resource allocation, and then propose a locally optimal solution by applying the techniques of alternating optimization and successive convex programming (SCP). Numerical results show that the proposed UAV-enabled WPCN achieves significant throughput gains over the conventional WPCN with fixed-location AP.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8489918,IEEE Internet of Things Journal,2019
Transceiver Design and Multihop D2D for UAV IoT Coverage in Disasters,"When natural disasters strike, the coverage for Internet of Things (IoT) may be severely destroyed, due to the damaged communications infrastructure. Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) can be exploited as flying base stations to provide emergency coverage for IoT, due to its mobility and flexibility. In this paper, we propose multiantenna transceiver design and multihop device-to-device (D2D) communication to guarantee the reliable transmission and extend the UAV coverage for IoT in disasters. First, multihop D2D links are established to extend the coverage of UAV emergency networks due to the constrained transmit power of the UAV. In particular, a shortest-path-routing algorithm is proposed to establish the D2D links rapidly with minimum nodes. The closed-form solutions for the number of hops and the outage probability are derived for the uplink and downlink. Second, the transceiver designs for the UAV uplink and downlink are studied to optimize the performance of UAV transmission. Due to the nonconvexity of the problem, they are first transformed into convex ones and then, low-complexity algorithms are proposed to solve them efficiently. Simulation results show the performance improvement in the throughput and outage probability by the proposed schemes for UAV wireless coverage of IoT in disasters.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8502795,IEEE Internet of Things Journal,2019
AKM-IoV: Authenticated Key Management Protocol in Fog Computing-Based Internet of Vehicles Deployment,"Internet of Vehicles (IoV) is an intelligent application of Internet of Things (IoT) in smart transportation that takes intelligent commitments to the passengers to improve traffic safety and efficiency, and generate a more enjoyable driving and riding environment. Fog cloud-based IoV is another variant of mobile cloud computing where vehicular cloud and Internet can co-operate in more effective way in IoV. However, more increasing dependence on wireless communication, control, and computing technology makes IoV more dangerous to prospective attacks. For secure communication among vehicles, road-side units, fog and cloud servers, we design a secure authenticated key management protocol in fog computing-based IoV deployment, called AKM-IoV. In the designed AKM-IoV, after mutual authentication between communicating entities in IoV they establish session keys for secure communications. AKM-IoV is tested for its security analysis using the formal security analysis under the widely accepted real-or-random (ROR) model, informal, and formal security verification using the broadly accepted automated validation of Internet security protocols and applications (AVISPAs) tool. The practical demonstration of AKM-IoV is shown using the NS2 simulation. In addition, a detailed comparative study is conducted to show the efficiency and functionality and security features supported by AKM-IoV as compared to other existing recent protocols.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8740937,IEEE Internet of Things Journal,2019
EKF-Based Visual Inertial Navigation Using Sliding Window Nonlinear Optimization,"In this paper, we present a hybrid visual inertial navigation algorithm for an autonomous and intelligent vehicle that combines the multi-state constraint Kalman filter (MSCKF) with the nonlinear visual-inertial graph optimization. The MSCKF is a well-known visual inertial odometry (VIO) method that performs the fusion between an inertial measurement unit (IMU) and the image measurements within a sliding window. The MSCKF computes the re-projection errors from the camera measurements and the states in the sliding window. During this process, the structure-only estimation is performed without exploiting the full information over the window, like the relative interstate motion constraints and their uncertainties. The key contribution of this paper is combination of the filtering and non-linear optimization method for VIO, and the design of a novel measurement model that exploits all of the measurements and information available within the sliding window. The local visual-inertial optimization is performed using pre-integrated IMU measurements and camera measurements. It infers the probabilistically optimal relative pose constraints. These local optimal constraints are used to estimate the global states under the MSCKF framework. The proposed local-optimal-multi-state constraint Kalman filter is validated using a simulation data set, as well as publicly available real-world data sets generated from real-world urban driving experiments.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8463496,IEEE Transactions on Intelligent Transportation Systems,2019
Toward Accurate Vehicle State Estimation Under Non-Gaussian Noises,"Vehicle state including location and motion information plays an important role in various applications such as Internet of Vehicles (IoV), autonomous cars, and driving safety monitoring. Achieving accurate vehicle state is a challenging task in those applications due to the noise disturbances. Recent studies suggest that noise is not generally Gaussian distributed and many physical environments can be handled more accurately as non-Gaussian rather than Gaussian model. Inspired by this observation, we strive to improve the vehicle state estimation by investigating the effects of that assumption when process and measurement noises are non-Gaussian distributed. Here, process noise represents the noise during the state information processing. To that end, we exploit the generalized error distribution (GED) to compute the non-Gaussian probability density during the vehicle state estimation. We then derive extensive theoretical analysis targeting to estimate the parameters such as the mean and the variance (or covariance matrix) related to both process and measurement noises and reduce the computational burden of the distribution. Further, we propose a non-Gaussian particle filter for vehicle state estimation (nGPF-VSE) algorithm wherein we utilize the genetic operator resampling (GOR) technique to enhance the efficiency of particle filter (PF) relying on the selection of the importance sampling distribution. To evaluate the performance of the proposed approach, we conduct numerical simulations on the popular system of state-space equations and a real experiment for estimating the vehicle state. The results from the numerical simulations, experimental data and the statistical evaluation confirm that nGPF-VSE outperforms existing methods in terms of vehicle state accuracy.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8830463,IEEE Internet of Things Journal,2019
Security Implications of Intentional Capacitive Crosstalk,"With advances in shrinking process technology sizes, the parasitic effects of closely routed adjacent wires, crosstalk, still present problems in practice since they directly influence performance and functionality. Even though there is a solid understanding of parasitic effects in hardware designs, the security implications of such undesired effects have been scarcely investigated. In this paper, we leverage the physical routing effects of capacitive crosstalk to demonstrate a new parametric hardware Trojan design methodology. We show that such Trojans can be implemented by only rerouting already existing resources. Thus, our approach possesses a zero-gate area overhead which is both stealthy and challenging to detect with standard visual inspection techniques. In two case studies, we demonstrate its devastating consequences: (1) we realize an implementation attack on a third-party cryptographic AES IP core and (2) we realize a privilege escalation on a general-purpose processor capable of running any modern operating system. In these case studies, we take special care to ensure that the Trojans do not violate design rule checks, which further highlights that the capacitive crosstalk Trojans can be building blocks for malicious circuitry design. We then investigate how state-of-the-art visual inspection techniques can be enhanced to cope with parametric hardware Trojans. In particular, we develop an automated layout-level mitigation approach which exploits the characteristic wire length of capacitive crosstalk Trojans. Finally, we highlight further implementation strategies for capacitive crosstalk Trojans and pinpoint future research directions.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8673644,IEEE Transactions on Information Forensics and Security,2019
Capacity and Delay of Unmanned Aerial Vehicle Networks With Mobility,"Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) are widely exploited in environment monitoring, search-and-rescue, etc. However, the mobility and short flight duration of UAVs bring challenges for UAV networking. In this paper, we study the UAV networks with n UAVs acting as aerial sensors. UAVs generally have short flight duration and need to frequently get energy replenishment from the control station. Hence, the returning UAVs bring the data of the UAVs along the returning paths to the control station with a store-carry-and-forward (SCF) mode. A critical range for the distance between the UAV and the control station is discovered. Within the critical range, the per-node capacity of the SCF mode is θ(n/logn) times higher than that of the multihop mode. However, the per-node capacity of the SCF mode outside the critical range decreases with the distance between the UAV and the control station. To eliminate the critical range, a mobility control scheme is proposed such that the capacity scaling laws of the SCF mode are the same for all UAVs, which improves the capacity performance of UAV networks. Moreover, the delay of the SCF mode is derived. The impact of the size of the entire region, the velocity of UAVs, the number of UAVs and the flight duration of UAVs on the delay of SCF mode is analyzed. This paper reveals that the mobility and short flight duration of UAVs have beneficial effects on the performance of UAV networks, which may motivate the study of SCF schemes for UAV networks.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8468018,IEEE Internet of Things Journal,2019
Generalized Wireless-Powered Communications: When to Activate Wireless Power Transfer?,"Wireless-powered communication network (WPCN) is a key technology to power energy limited massive devices, such as on-board wireless sensors in autonomous vehicles, for Internet-of-Things applications. Conventional WPCNs rely only on dedicated downlink wireless power transfer (WPT), which is practically inefficient due to the significant energy loss in wireless signal propagation. Meanwhile, ambient energy harvesting is highly appealing as devices can scavenge energy from various existing energy sources (e.g., solar energy and cellular signals). Unfortunately, the randomness of the availability of these energy sources cannot guarantee stable communication services. Motivated by the above statements, we consider a generalized WPCN where the devices can not only harvest energy from a dedicated multiple-antenna power station (PS), but can also exploit stored energy stemming from ambient energy harvesting. Since the dedicated WPT consumes system resources, if the stored energy is sufficient, WPT may not be needed to maximize the weighted sum rate. To analytically characterize this phenomenon, we derive the condition for WPT activation and reveal how it is affected by the different system parameters. Subsequently, we further derive the optimal resource allocation policy for the cases that WPT is activated and deactivated, respectively. In particular, it is found that when WPT is activated, the optimal energy beamforming at the PS does not depend on the devices' stored energy, which is shown to lead to a new unfairness issue. Simulation results verify our theoretical findings and demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed optimal resource allocation.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8742610,IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology,2019
Novel Control Approaches for Demand Response With Real-Time Pricing Using Parallel and Distributed Consensus-Based ADMM,"This paper studies the automated demand response (DR) problem in smart grids equipped with information and communication technology networks, where power generating and consuming units can exchange information as a multiagent system (MAS), and a real-time pricing (RTP) scheme is proposed. When the communication graph among agents is connected, a novel parallel and distributed consensus-based algorithm is proposed to derive an RTP scheme to facilitate DR, and when communication uncertainties exist, a robust consensus algorithm is proposed to cease the effect of uncertainties. Next, this paper proposes a novel control mechanism to tackle the problem of disconnected communication among agents, e.g., under cyber-attacks, by employing the so-called mixed communication-broadcast control architecture where the underlying ideas are twofold. First, each area in the grid associated with a connected subgraph is controlled by a MAS to guarantee the power balance and to reach consensus on the local electric price for that area. Second, a supervisory unit observes those local electric prices to calculate the global electric price for the whole grid and then broadcasts to all units so that they can properly adjust their output powers. Simulations are carried out on the IEEE 39-bus system to validate the proposed control mechanisms.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8556392,IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics,2019
An Efficient B-Spline-Based Kinodynamic Replanning Framework for Quadrotors,"Trajectory replanning for quadrotors is essential to enable fully autonomous flight in unknown environments. Hierarchical motion planning frameworks, which combine path planning with path parameterization, are popular due to their time efficiency. However, the path planning cannot properly deal with nonstatic initial states of the quadrotor, which may result in nonsmooth or even dynamically infeasible trajectories. In this article, we present an efficient kinodynamic replanning framework by exploiting the advantageous properties of the B-spline, which facilitates dealing with the nonstatic state and guarantees safety and dynamical feasibility. Our framework starts with an efficient B-spline-based kinodynamic (EBK) search algorithm, which finds a feasible trajectory with minimum control effort and time. To compensate for the discretization induced by the EBK search, an elastic optimization approach is proposed to refine the control point placement to the optimal location. Systematic comparisons against the state-of-the-art are conducted to validate the performance. Comprehensive onboard experiments using two different vision-based quadrotors are carried out showing the general applicability of the framework.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8811597,IEEE Transactions on Robotics,2019
PHY-Layer Cover-Free Coding for Wireless Pilot Authentication in IoV Communications: Protocol Design and Ultra-Security Proof,"Wireless channel state information (CSI) from intelligent vehicles to the roadside unit (RSU) is a must for vehicleto-infrastructure (V2I) communications in Internet of Vehicles, but easily suffers the risks of being attacked due to the publicly known and deterministic characteristic of PHY-layer pilots that are employed for CSI acquisition. This incurs the issue of wireless pilot authentication (WPA), that is, verifying the authenticity of pilots and claimed CSIs. In this paper, we, for multiantenna V2I orthogonal frequency division multiplexed communications, develop a PHY-layer cover-free (PHY-CF) coding theory to build up a secure WPA (SWPA) protocol. Here, we encode and convey vehicle pilot signals into diversified subcarrier activation patterns (SAPs) on the time-frequency domain by employing cover-free coding. We redesign the decoding procedure using the signal independence characteristic such that those encoded SAPs, though camouflaged by malicious signals and superimposed onto each other in wireless environment, could be separated, identified and decoded into the original pilots securely. For this protocol, we prove that perfect pilot conveying and separation could be both guaranteed. We formulate the pilot identification error probability (IEP) and show how PHY-CF coding could help position the location of attacker and reduce IEP to further achieve ultrasecurity. Considering 20 MHz long-term evolution bandwidth, we prove that the number of co-time co-frequency vehicles that are securely authenticated achieves up to 19 × X for X serving sectors of base station type RSU and the latency time of uplink data access is up to 1.5 ms, thus furthering the autonomous driving. Computer simulations comprehensively verify those benefits of proposed SWPA protocol.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8510793,IEEE Internet of Things Journal,2019
Secrecy Performance Analysis of Wireless Communications in the Presence of UAV Jammer and Randomly Located UAV Eavesdroppers,"Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) have been undergoing fast development for providing broader signal coverage and more extensive surveillance capabilities in military and civilian applications. Due to the broadcast nature of the wireless signal and the openness of the space, UAV eavesdroppers (UEDs) pose a potential threat to ground communications. In this paper, we consider the communications of a legitimate ground link in the presence of friendly jamming and UEDs within a finite area of space. The spatial distribution of the UEDs obeying a uniform binomial point process (BPP) is used to characterize the randomness of the UEDs. The ground link is assumed to experience log-distance path loss and Rayleigh fading, while free space path loss with/without the averaged excess path loss due to the environment is used for the air-to-ground/air-to-air links. A piecewise function is proposed to approximate the line-of-sight (LoS) probability for the air-to-ground links, which provides a better approximation than using the existing sigmoid-based fitting. The analytical expression for the secure connection probability (SCP) of the legitimate ground link in the presence of non-colluding UEDs is derived. The analysis reveals some useful trends in the SCP as a function of the transmit signal to jamming power ratio, the locations of the UAV jammer, and the height of UAVs.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8693785,IEEE Transactions on Information Forensics and Security,2019
Energy Efficient Legitimate Wireless Surveillance of UAV Communications,"Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) enhance connectivity and accessibility for civilian and military applications. Criminals or terrorists can potentially use UAVs for committing crimes and terrorism, thus endangering public safety. In this paper, we consider that a legitimate UAV is employed to track flight of suspicious UAVs for preventing safety and security threats. To obtain flight information of the suspicious UAVs, the legitimate UAV intentionally jams the suspicious receiver so as to force the suspicious UAV to reduce its data rate, and hence increase the eavesdropping success. An energy-efficient jamming strategy is proposed for the legitimate UAV to maximize the amount of eavesdropped packets. Moreover, a tracking algorithm is developed for the legitimate UAV to track the suspicious flight by comprehensively utilizing eavesdropped packets, angle-of-arrival and received signal strength of the suspicious transmitter's signal. A new simulation framework is implemented to combine the complementary features of optimization toolbox with channel modeling (in MATLAB) and discrete event-driven mobility tracking (in NS3). Moreover, numerical results validate the proposed algorithms in terms of packet eavesdropping rate and tracking accuracy of the suspicious UAVs' trajectory.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8601408,IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology,2019
Cognitive Risk Control for Anti-Jamming V2V Communications in Autonomous Vehicle Networks,"The future of intelligent transportation system (ITS) is expected to be composed of connected and autonomous vehicles (CAVs), the development of which will have great impact on people's everyday life. Unfortunately, this progress will be accompanied by all kinds of potential threats and attacks rising in CAV network. As a legacy from traditional wireless networks, jamming attack is still one of the major and serious threats to vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) communications. In this paper, we investigate the anti-jamming V2V communication in CAV networks through power control in conjunction with channel selection. Bringing into play a brain-inspired research tool called cognitive dynamic system (CDS), the general structure of cognitive risk control (CRC) is well-tailored to analyze and address the jamming problem. Specifically, power control is carried out first using reinforcement learning, the result of which is then examined by a module called task-switch control. Based on the risk assessment, a multi-armed bandit (MAB) problem is formulated to perform the channel-selection process when necessary. Through continuous perception-action cycles (PACs), the feature of predictive adaptation is realized for the legitimate vehicle in its behavioral interactions with the jammer. Simulation results have shown that the proposed method has desirable performance in terms of several evaluation metrics.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8805437,IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology,2019
Deployment Algorithms of Flying Base Stations: 5G and Beyond With UAVs,"Exploiting unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) as flying base stations (BSs) to assist the terrestrial cellular networks is promising in 5G and beyond. Despite the inherent potentials, one challenging problem is how to optimally deploy multiple UAVs to achieve on-demand coverage for ground user equipment (UE). In this article, we model the deployment problem as minimizing the number of UAVs and maximizing the load balance among them, which is subject to two main constraints, i.e., UAVs should form a robust backbone network and they should keep connected with the fixed BSs. To solve this optimization problem with low complexity, we decompose the problem into two subproblems and propose a hybrid algorithm to solve them stepwise. First, a centralized greedy search algorithm is used to heuristically obtain the minimum number of UAVs and their suboptimal positions in a discontinuous space. Then, a distributed motion algorithm is adopted which enables each UAV to autonomously control its motion toward the optimal position in a continuous space. The proposed algorithm is applicable to various scenarios where UAVs are deployed alone or with fixed BSs regardless of the UE distribution. Extensive simulations validate the proposed algorithm.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8796414,IEEE Internet of Things Journal,2019
Rechargeable Multi-UAV Aided Seamless Coverage for QoS-Guaranteed IoT Networks,"Due to their high flexibility, high maneuverability, and line-of-sight (LOS) predominant channel, unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) serving as flying base stations have received a lot of interest in emerging Internet of Things (IoT) networks. This article studies the energy-efficient cooperative strategy of rechargeable multi-UAVs for providing seamless coverage and long-term information services for IoT nodes. Considering the limited cruising duration of the UAV, multiple rechargeable UAVs are capable of constructing a closed chain for the sake of alternately supporting IoT nodes. Moreover, a joint IoT node assignment and UAV configuration optimization problem is proposed in order to maximize the energy efficiency of the system. Since the proposed problem is a mixed-integer nonconvex problem, we divide it into three subproblems, namely, node assignment scheduling, UAV trajectory planning, and transmit power control. By exploiting sequential convex optimization techniques, we reformulate the nonconvex subproblems into three convex optimization problems which can be solved within the polynomial time. A block coordinate descent-based iterative algorithm is proposed for solving these energy-efficiency oriented subproblems. Finally, the simulation results corroborate the effectiveness of our proposed method.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8847391,IEEE Internet of Things Journal,2019
UAV-Enabled Spatial Data Sampling in Large-Scale IoT Systems Using Denoising Autoencoder Neural Network,"Internet of Things (IoT) technology has been pervasively applied to environmental monitoring, due to the advantages of low cost and flexible deployment of IoT enabled systems. In many large-scale IoT systems, accurate and efficient data sampling and reconstruction is among the most critical requirements, since this can relieve the data rate of trunk link for data uploading while ensure data accuracy. To address the related challenges, we have proposed an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) enabled spatial data sampling scheme in this paper using denoising autoencoder (DAE) neural network. More specifically, a UAV-enabled edge-cloud collaborative IoT system architecture is first developed for data processing in large-scale IoT monitoring systems, where UAV is utilized as mobile edge computing device. Based on this system architecture, the UAV-enabled spatial data sampling scheme is further proposed, where the wireless sensor nodes of large-scale IoT systems are clustered by a newly developed bounded-size K-means clustering algorithm. A neural network model, i.e., DAE, is applied to each cluster for data sampling and reconstruction, by exploitation of both linear and nonlinear spatial correlation among data samples. Simulations have been conducted and the results indicate that the proposed scheme has improved data reconstruction accuracy under the sampling ratio without introducing extra complexity, as compared to the compressive sensing-based method.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8496746,IEEE Internet of Things Journal,2019
Performance Analysis and Optimization of UAV Integrated Terrestrial Cellular Network,"Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) have been extensively applied as aerial access points to assist the terrestrial wireless network. Despite the inherent potential, nevertheless, it still remains to explore whether the gain of UAV access points (UAPs) could be fully harvested, which is critically dependent on the factors including the flight altitude and deployment density of UAPs. In this light, we investigate the performance of a downlink UAV integrated terrestrial cellular network (UTCN) and analytically study the influence of varying UAP altitude and density on the spatial throughput (ST) of UTCN. In particular, we obtain the UAP altitude upper bound, below which more line-of-sight (LOS) connections could be provided to improve network ST. Otherwise, cross-layer interference over the LOS paths becomes dominant, which results in significant degradation of network ST. More importantly, we reveal the limitation of the application of UAPs by showing that there exists a critical UAP density, beyond which network ST would encounter a rapid decrease. To fully exploit the potential of UAPs, we further tailor a probabilistic interference avoidance scheme and study the optimization of the UAP activated probability. Remarkably, network ST could be substantially improved using the optimized activated probability, i.e., network ST could increase with the growing UAP density and converge to a positive constant instead of zero in the dense UAP regime. Therefore, the results of this paper could provide insight on the deployment and optimization of UTCN.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8515027,IEEE Internet of Things Journal,2019
Active Localization of Gas Leaks Using Fluid Simulation,"Sensors are routinely mounted on robots to acquire various forms of measurements in spatiotemporal fields. Locating features within these fields and reconstruction (mapping) of the dense fields can be challenging in resource-constrained situations, such as when trying to locate the source of a gas leak from a small number of measurements. In such cases, a model of the underlying complex dynamics can be exploited to discover informative paths within the field. We use a fluid simulator as a model to guide inference for the location of a gas leak. We perform localization via minimization of the discrepancy between observed measurements and gas concentrations predicted by the simulator. Our method is able to account for dynamically varying parameters of wind flow (e.g., direction and strength) and its effects on the observed distribution of gas. We develop algorithms for offline inference as well as for online path discovery via active sensing. We demonstrate the efficiency, accuracy, and versatility of our algorithm using experiments with a physical robot conducted in outdoor environments. We deploy an unmanned air vehicle mounted with a CO$_2$ sensor to automatically seek out a gas cylinder emitting CO$_2$ via a nozzle. We evaluate the accuracy of our algorithm by measuring the error in the inferred location of the nozzle, based on which we show that our proposed approach is competitive with respect to state-of-the-art baselines.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8629026,IEEE Robotics and Automation Letters,2019
A Novel Alternative Optimization Method for Joint Power and Trajectory Design in UAV-Enabled Wireless Network,"This correspondence aims to maximize the average throughput via the joint design of the transmit power and trajectory for unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV)-enabled network. The conventional way to tackle this problem is based on the alternating optimization (AO) method by iteratively updating power and trajectory until convergence, resulting in a non-convex trajectory subproblem which is difficult to deal with. To develop more efficient methods, we propose a novel AO method by incorporating both power and trajectory into an intermediate variable, and then iteratively updating power and the newly introduced variable. This novel variable transformation makes it easier to decompose the original problem into two convex subproblems, namely a throughput maximization subproblem and a feasibility subproblem. Consequently, both of these subproblems can be solved in a globally optimal fashion. We further propose a low-complexity algorithm for the feasibility subproblem by exploiting the alternating directional method of multipliers (ADMM), whose updating step is performed in closed-form solutions. Simulation results demonstrate that our proposed method reduces the computation time by orders of magnitude, while achieving higher performance than the conventional methods.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8828093,IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology,2019

The proposed controller ensures the horizontal position alignment and a smooth touchdown of the aircraft without estimating the height above the runway. In addition, the 2-D image-based control structure adopted also enforces wind disturbance rejection, without the need for an explicit wind estimator.

Mobility-Aware Multipath Communication for Unmanned Aerial Surveillance Systems,"Wireless communication platforms of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), commonly known as drones, usually operate in dynamic conditions with highly fluctuating capacities and erratic wireless access to the network resources. Effective design for adequate, robust, and consistent communications from the drones to the control center (aka server) is thus necessary to facilitate the implementation of the UAV system. Multipath TCP has the potential to exploit heterogeneous wireless paths and achieve robust bandwidth by controlling the dynamics of the convoy of drones. In this paper, we make use of fluid approach for proposing a generic system architecture toward a control mechanism for coordinating the convoy of drones. Moreover, we model multipath TCP and study their applications for the control scenario of a convoy of drones with three different communication interfaces, representing the head, tail, and the middle of the convoy. The access is through a satellite and several WiFi access points (APs) communicating to the server with time-variant wireless channel, subject to the dynamic mobility and distance of APs from the convoy's head and tail. The traffic on different paths governed by the flow control based on the movement and position of the convoy enable us to investigate the performance and convergence of communication system dynamics. In particular, Lyapunov theory is adopted to derive the stability conditions of the dynamics over the mobility of the convoy.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8700598,IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology,2019
Two-Stage Request Scheduling for Autonomous Vehicle Logistic System,"Autonomous vehicles are expected to play an important role in handling the last mile logistics in intelligent transportation systems thanks to their unmanned nature and full-fledged controllability. Recently, an autonomous vehicle logistic system (AVLS) was proposed, which employs autonomous vehicles to serve logistic requests and utilize the excessive renewable energy generated by distributed generations. In this paper, we propose an optimization problem for AVLS to develop schedules for request allocation, vehicle routing, and battery charging. By considering the unique characteristics of AVLS, the proposed scheduling problem can exploit its advantages in goods delivery and renewable energy utilization over existing logistic request allocation algorithms. We formulate the problem as a mixed integer non-linear program. To improve its scalability, we also devise a two-stage scheduling methodology to approach the optimal solutions of the original problem. We conduct comprehensive simulations to assess the performance of the proposed request scheduling problem and two-stage scheduling methodology. The results indicate that the proposed problem can improve the efficacy of AVLS in terms of total travel distance and utilized renewable energy, and the two-stage methodology can develop near-optimal solutions with notably reduced computation time.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8403887,IEEE Transactions on Intelligent Transportation Systems,2019
AgriColMap: Aerial-Ground Collaborative 3D Mapping for Precision Farming,"The combination of aerial survey capabilities of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) with targeted intervention abilities of agricultural unmanned ground vehicles (UGVs) can significantly improve the effectiveness of robotic systems applied to precision agriculture. In this context, building and updating a common map of the field is an essential but challenging task. The maps built using robots of different types show differences in size, resolution, and scale, the associated geolocation data may be inaccurate and biased while the repetitiveness of both visual appearance and geometric structures found within agricultural contexts render classical map merging techniques ineffective. In this letter, we propose AgriColMap, a novel map registration pipeline that leverages a grid-based multimodal environment representation, which includes a vegetation index map and a digital surface model. We cast the data association problem between maps built from UAVs and UGVs as a multimodal, large displacement dense optical flow estimation. The dominant, coherent flows, selected using a voting scheme, are used as point-to-point correspondences to infer a preliminary nonrigid alignment between the maps. A final refinement is then performed, by exploiting only meaningful parts of the registered maps. We evaluate our system using real-world data for three fields with different crop species. The results show that our method outperforms several state-of-the-art map registration and matching techniques by a large margin, and has a higher tolerance to large initial misalignments.

Human-Centered Risk Assessment of an Automated Vehicle Using Vehicular Wireless Communication,"This paper presents a human-centered risk assessment algorithm using vehicular communication for application to an automated driving vehicle. Vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) wireless communication has been implemented and fused with a radar sensor to obtain the prediction of the remote vehicle's motion. Based on the predicted behavior of remote vehicles, a collision risk and a human reaction time are determined for a human-centered active safety control intervention moment. The human-centered risk assessment algorithm has been incorporated into a collision avoidance algorithm to monitor threat vehicles ahead and to find the best intervention point. Effects of the vehicular communication on a perception and a control performance are investigated. The performance of the proposed algorithm has been investigated via computer simulations and vehicle tests. It has been shown from both simulations and vehicle tests that the proposed human-centered risk assessment algorithm with V2V communication decides a proper active safety intervention moment by reducing the chances of over/underestimate of a conventional radar-only system.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8353347,IEEE Transactions on Intelligent Transportation Systems,2019
TCALAS: Temporal Credential-Based Anonymous Lightweight Authentication Scheme for Internet of Drones Environment,"A user (external party) is interested in accessing the real-time data from some designated drones of a particular fly zone in the Internet of Drones (IoD) deployment. However, to provide this facility, the user needs to be authenticated by an accessed remote drone and vice-versa. After successful authentication both parties can establish a secret session key for the secure communication. To handle this important problem in IoD environment, we design a novel temporal credential based anonymous lightweight user authentication mechanism for IoD environment, called TCALAS. A detailed security analysis using formal security under the broadly applied real-or-random (ROR) model, formal security verification under the broadly used software verification tool, known as automated validation of internet security protocols and applications, and also informal security analysis reveal that TCALAS has the capability to resist various known attacks against passive/active adversary. In addition, a detailed comparative study has been conducted for TCALAS and other related schemes, and the study also reveals that TCALAS provides better security and functionality features, and lower costs in both computation and communication as compared to existing schemes.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8693567,IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology,2019
Physical-Layer Security of 5G Wireless Networks for IoT: Challenges and Opportunities,"The fifth generation (5G) wireless technologies serve as a key propellent to meet the increasing demands of the future Internet of Things (IoT) networks. For wireless communication security in 5G IoT networks, physical-layer security (PLS) has recently received growing interest. This paper aims to provide a comprehensive survey of the PLS techniques in 5G IoT communication systems. The investigation consists of four hierarchical parts. In the first part, we review the characteristics of 5G IoT under typical application scenarios. We then introduce the security threats from the 5G IoT physical-layer and categorize them according to the different purposes of the attacker. In the third part, we examine the 5G communication technologies in 5G IoT systems and discuss their challenges and opportunities when coping with physical-layer threats, including massive multiple-input-multiple-output (MIMO), millimeter wave (mmWave) communications, nonorthogonal multiple access (NOMA), full-duplex technology, energy harvesting (EH), visible light communication (VLC), and unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) communications. Finally, we discuss open research problems and future works about PLS in the IoT system with technologies of 5G and beyond.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8758230,IEEE Internet of Things Journal,2019
Network Design for Accurate Vehicle Localization,"Network-based localization plays a key role on the introduction of emerging road applications, such as connected autonomous driving. These applications demand unprecedented precise, reliable and secure positioning, with localization requirements below 1 m. This stringent demand is pushing for the use of road-side units (RSUs) from fifth generation and vehicular networks for accurate vehicle localization. However, these networks are not typically designed for positioning but for data communication purposes, which follow a different paradigm for the network deployment and operation. This paper provides design guidelines on dedicated network deployments with the aim of achieving accurate vehicle-to-infrastructure positioning in road scenarios. First, the network layout or site placement is assessed with a geometrical metric. Then, the minimum density of RSUs along the road is bounded with line-of-sight probability models for urban street and highway scenarios. Finally, the Cramér-Rao bound for joint time-of-arrival (ToA) and angle-of-arrival (AoA) localization is used to maximize the distance between RSUs along the road, by exploiting multi-antenna deployments. According to the simulation results, the network sites are recommended to be located at alternate sides of the road, with a maximum distance between RSUs of 40 and 230 m for urban and rural environments, respectively. Following these design guidelines, there is also the need to exploit antenna arrays to combine uplink ToA and AoA estimates, in order to ensure a vehicle location accuracy below one meter on the 95% of the cases. The use of eight antenna elements at the RSUs is found to reduce nearly one and a half times the minimum network density in highway localization deployments.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8671747,IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology,2019
Machine Learning Inspired Sound-Based Amateur Drone Detection for Public Safety Applications,"In recent years, popularity of unmanned air vehicles enormously increased due to their autonomous moving capability and applications in various domains. This also results in some serious security threats, that needs proper investigation and timely detection of the amateur drones (ADr) to protect the security sensitive institutions. In this paper, we propose the novel machine learning (ML) framework for detection and classification of ADr sounds out of the various sounds like bird, airplanes, and thunderstorm in the noisy environment. To extract the necessary features from ADr sound, Mel frequency cepstral coefficients (MFCC), and linear predictive cepstral coefficients (LPCC) feature extraction techniques are implemented. After feature extraction, support vector machines (SVM) with various kernels are adopted to accurately classify these sounds. The experimental results verify that SVM cubic kernel with MFCC outperform LPCC method by achieving around 96.7% accuracy for ADr detection. Moreover, the results verified that the proposed ML scheme has more than 17% detection accuracy, compared with correlation-based drone sound detection scheme that ignores ML prediction.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8616877,IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology,2019
Cooperative Shock Waves Mitigation in Mixed Traffic Flow Environment,"Human driver behavior strongly influences traffic flow by increasing the spread of shock waves in a downstream direction. This paper addresses the problem of traffic congestion mitigation in a mixed scenario composed of connected human-driven and autonomous vehicles. The control protocol, driving the longitudinal motion of the autonomous vehicles, is designed for damping down traffic waves. The effectiveness of the strategy, and ability to cope with multiple and time-varying delays originated by the non-ideal wireless communication among connected vehicles, is both analytically and numerically analyzed. The asymptotic stability of the algorithm is mathematically proved by leveraging a Lyapunov-Krasovskii functional, while the head-to-tail stability tool is exploited for the tuning of the control gains. The performance of the control strategy is disclosed by using hardware-in-the-loop real-time simulation for an exemplary pattern of three vehicles. The effectiveness of the proposed cooperative strategy in longer queues of vehicles is, instead, investigated through PLEXE, an inter-vehicular communication and mobility simulator that includes features for autonomous vehicles as well as for the realistic emulation of the IEEE 802.11p standard. The results confirm the robustness of the approach and its ability in damping disturbances and mitigating stop-and-go effects according to the theoretical derivation.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8602438,IEEE Transactions on Intelligent Transportation Systems,2019
Detecting Vehicle Anomaly in the Edge via Sensor Consistency and Frequency Characteristic,"Autonomous vehicles are expected to significantly enhance the human mobility. However, recently researchers have discovered and demonstrated some attacks on vehicles, which have caused a panic among the public. Furthermore, these attacks have demonstrated that the security issue is still one of the major challenges of vehicles. In this paper, we propose a novel edge computing based anomaly detection, coined edge computing based vehicle anomaly detection (EVAD), which exploits edge based sensor data fusion to identify the anomaly events. The time domain property, i.e., the correlation between different intra-vehicle sensors, and the frequency domain property of sensor data are utilized to judge whether an anomaly has occurred within the vehicle. Especially, to reduce the computation overhead and improve the performance, multiple sensors will be organized as ring architecture, which is a tradeoff of detection accuracy and complexity. In addition, the major components (e.g., anomaly detection module) of EVAD are embedded in edge computing devices, which make the anomaly detection be more efficient and privacy preserving. Meanwhile, a more appropriate model is generated on the cloud server, of which computation overhead maybe heavy for edge computing devices. This paper evaluates the performance of EVAD under different scenarios, and the experimental results demonstrate its feasibility and efficiency. The average true positive rate achieves 99.5% with 1% false positive rate.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8675434,IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology,2019
A Predictive Perception Model and Control Strategy for Collision-Free Autonomous Driving,"A key issue in autonomous driving is the problem of decision logic, particularly, as it pertains to mixed traffic involving autonomous and human-driven vehicles. With this in mind, we develop an approach for modeling the interaction between autonomous and human-driven (or perhaps other autonomous) vehicles via game theory and assess the time evolution of potential collision paths via a reachability analysis of the solution set of a simple hybrid dynamical system that captures the kinematics of the lane-change process. We further utilize a control strategy based on model predictive control to develop a safety-assured motion profile on the part of the subject vehicle. This model is subsequently evaluated in multiple simulation scenarios as a function of a programmable safety assurance parameter. We should emphasize that the proposed approach is proactive in its outlook, as it considers a temporal horizon spanning several seconds and assumes a certain behavioral consistency on the part of the local traffic participants. As such it must be augmented with an appropriate reactive collision mitigation scheme that responds to immediate threats caused by abrupt behaviors that are not predictable via algorithmic schemes. Nevertheless, the scenarios studied here appear to produce intuitively reasonable behaviors that seem consistent with ordinary driving and highlight the prospects of this approach being implemented in autonomous driving strategies.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8563105,IEEE Transactions on Intelligent Transportation Systems,2019
Routing and Scheduling for Hybrid Truck-Drone Collaborative Parcel Delivery With Independent and Truck-Carried Drones,"The enabling Internet-of-Things (IoT) technology has inspired a large number of novel platforms and applications. One popular IoT platform is unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs, also known as drone). Benefiting from the intrinsic flexibility, convenience, and low cost, UAVs have great potentials to be utilized in various civil applications, including parcel delivery. However, suffering from limited payloads and battery capacities, it is uneconomical for UAVs to perform parcel delivery tasks independently. To conquer the drawbacks of low payloads and battery capacities, people propose to employ both trucks and drones to construct truck-drone parcel delivery systems. However, previous works only leverage either independent drones or truck-carried drones to collaborate with trucks. In contrast, in this article we propose to simultaneously employ trucks, truck-carried drones, and independent drones to construct a more efficient truck-drone parcel delivery system. We claim that such a hybrid parcel delivery system can fully exploit the complementary benefits of the three platforms. We propose a novel routing and scheduling algorithm, referred to as hybrid truck-drone delivery (HTDD) algorithm, to solve the hybrid parcel delivery problem, wherein M drones carried by M trucks, together with N independent drones, cooperate to deliver parcels to customers distributed in a wide region. The experimental results show that our algorithm outperforms the existing solutions which employ either independent drones or truck-carried drones.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8824100,IEEE Internet of Things Journal,2019
"Improving Localization Accuracy in Connected Vehicle Networks Using Rao–Blackwellized Particle Filters: Theory, Simulations, and Experiments","A crucial function for automated vehicle technologies is accurate localization. Lane-level accuracy is not readily available from low-cost global navigation satellite system (GNSS) receivers because of factors such as multipath error and atmospheric bias. Approaches such as differential GNSS can improve localization accuracy, but usually require investment in expensive base stations. Connected vehicle technologies provide an alternative approach in improving the localization accuracy. It will be shown in this paper that localization accuracy can be enhanced using crude GNSS measurements from a group of connected vehicles, by matching their locations to a digital map. A Rao-Blackwellized particle filter is used to jointly estimate the common biases of the pseudo-ranges and the vehicle positions. Multipath biases, which introduce receiver-specific (non-common) error, are mitigated by a multi-hypothesis detection-rejection approach. The temporal correlation of the estimations is exploited through the prediction-update process. The proposed approach is compared with existing methods using both simulations and experimental results. It was found that the proposed algorithm can eliminate the common biases and reduce the localization error to below 1 m under open sky conditions.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8463586,IEEE Transactions on Intelligent Transportation Systems,2019
Distributed Robust PID Control For Leader Tracking in Uncertain Connected Ground Vehicles With V2V Communication Delay,"The paper addresses the leader tracking problem for a platoon of connected autonomous vehicles in the presence of both homogeneous time-varying parameter uncertainties and vehicle-to-vehicle time-varying communication delay. To this aim, leveraging the multiagent systems (MAS) framework, a novel distributed robust proportional-integral-derivative control is proposed. The stability of the cohesive formation is analytically proved with a Lyapunov-Krasovskii approach by exploiting the descriptor transformation for time-delayed systems of neutral type. The delay-dependent robust stability conditions are expressed as a set of linear matrix inequalities allowing the proper tuning of the proportional, integral, and derivative actions implemented on each of the vehicles within the fleet. Extensive simulation analysis in different driving scenarios confirms the effectiveness of the theoretical derivation.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8673609,IEEE/ASME Transactions on Mechatronics,2019
Locating Multiple GPS Jammers Using Networked UAVs,"Recent technologies, such as, Internet of Things and cloud services, increases the usage of small and low-cost networked unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), which needs to be robust against malicious global positioning system (GPS) attacks. Due to the availability of low-cost GPS jammers in the commercial market, there has been a rising risk of multiple jammers and not just one. However, it is challenging to locate multiple jammers because the traditional jammer localization via multilateration is applicable for only a single jammer case. Also, during a jamming attack, the positioning capability of an on-board GPS receiver is compromised given its inability to track GPS signals. We propose a simultaneous localization of multiple jammers and receivers (SLMR) algorithm by analyzing the variation in the front-end signal power recorded by the GPS receivers on-board a network of UAVs. Our algorithm not only locates multiple jammers but also utilizes these malicious sources as additional navigation signals for positioning the UAVs. We design a Gaussian mixture probability hypothesis density filter over a graph framework, which is optimized using a Levenberg-Marquardt minimizer. Using a simulated experimental setup, we validate the convergence and localization accuracy of our SLMR algorithm for various cases, including attacks with a single jammer, multiple jammers, and a varying number of jammers. We also demonstrate that our SLMR algorithm is able to simultaneously locate multiple jammers and UAVs, even for a larger transmitted power of the jammers.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8629980,IEEE Internet of Things Journal,2019
Design and Analysis of Secure Lightweight Remote User Authentication and Key Agreement Scheme in Internet of Drones Deployment,"The Internet of Drones (IoD) provides a coordinated access to unmanned aerial vehicles that are referred as drones. The on-going miniaturization of sensors, actuators, and processors with ubiquitous wireless connectivity makes drones to be used in a wide range of applications ranging from military to civilian. Since most of the applications involved in the IoD are real-time based, the users are generally interested in accessing real-time information from drones belonging to a particular fly zone. This happens if we allow users to directly access real-time data from flying drones inside IoD environment and not from the server. This is a serious security breach which may deteriorate performance of any implemented solution in this IoD environment. To address this important issue in IoD, we propose a novel lightweight user authentication scheme in which a user in the IoD environment needs to access data directly from a drone provided that the user is authorized to access the data from that drone. The formal security verification using the broadly accepted automated validation of Internet security protocols and applications tool along with informal security analysis show that our scheme is secure against several known attacks. The performance comparison demonstrates that our scheme is efficient with respect to various parameters, and it provides better security as compared to those for the related existing schemes. Finally, the practical demonstration of our scheme is done using the widely accepted NS2 simulation.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8581510,IEEE Internet of Things Journal,2019
A Comparison of Stateless Position-based Packet Routing Algorithms for FANETs,"Scalable routing for wireless communication systems is a compelling and challenging task. To this aim, routing algorithms exploiting geographic information have been proposed. These algorithms refer to nodes by their location, rather than their address, and use those coordinates to route greedily towards a destination. With the advent of unmanned airborne vehicle (UAV) technology, a lot of research effort has been devoted to extend position-based packet routing proposals to three dimensional environments. In this context, Flying Ad-hoc Networks (FANETs), comprised of autonomous flying vehicles, pose several issues. This work focuses on the state-of-the-art, stateless geographic packet routing protocols conceived or adapted for three-dimensional network scenarios. Proposals are evaluated over a common scenario through a comprehensive comparative analysis.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8305664,IEEE Transactions on Mobile Computing,2018
Asynchronous Stochastic Approximation Based Learning Algorithms for As-You-Go Deployment of Wireless Relay Networks Along a Line,"We are motivated by the need, in emergency situations, for impromptu (or “as-you-go”) deployment of multihop wireless networks, by human agents or robots (e.g., unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs)); the agent moves along a line, makes wireless link quality measurements at regular intervals, and makes on-line placement decisions using these measurements. As a first step, we have formulated such deployment along a line as a sequential decision problem. In our earlier work, reported in [1], we proposed two possible deployment approaches: (i) the pure as-you-go approach where the deployment agent can only move forward, and (ii) the explore-forward approach where the deployment agent explores a few successive steps and then selects the best relay placement location among them. The latter was shown to provide better performance (in terms of network cost, network performance, and power expenditure), but at the expense of more measurements and deployment time, which makes explore-forward impractical for quick deployment by an energy constrained agent such as a UAV. Further, since in emergency situations the terrain would be unknown, the deployment algorithm should not require a-priori knowledge of the parameters of the wireless propagation model. In [1], we, therefore, developed learning algorithms for the explore-forward approach. The current paper fills in an important gap by providing deploy-and-learn algorithms for the pure as-you-go approach. We formulate the sequential relay deployment problem as an average cost Markov decision process (MDP), which trades off among power consumption, link outage probabilities, and the number of relay nodes in the deployed network. While the pure as-you-go deployment problem was previously formulated as a discounted cost MDP (see [1]), the discounted cost MDP formulation was not amenable for learning algorithms that are proposed in this paper. In this paper, first we show structural results for the optimal policy corresponding to the average cost MDP, and provide new insights into the optimal policy. Next, by exploiting the special structure of the average cost optimality equation and by using the theory of asynchronous stochastic approximation (in single and two timescale), we develop two learning algorithms that asymptotically converge to the set of optimal policies as deployment progresses. Numerical results show reasonably fast speed of convergence, and hence the model-free algorithms can be useful for practical, fast deployment of emergency wireless networks.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8031354,IEEE Transactions on Mobile Computing,2018
A Point-to-Ray Framework for Generating Smooth Parallel Parking Maneuvers,"The problem of generating smooth parallel parking maneuver for autonomous car-like vehicles is considered, wherein the vehicle moves forward from the starting point to an intermediate point and then traces a path backward to the parking position. Any error in accurately reaching the intermediate point leads to maneuver replanning and hence puts extra computational burden on the planner. Addressing the issue, this letter formulates the problem in a point-to-ray framework connecting the parking position to all points in a neighborhood of the intermediate point. Exploiting its asymptotic convergence, four parameter logistic (4PL) curve based S-shaped path is proposed as a solution with a single maneuver connecting the intermediate point neighborhood to the parking position. Inherent to the 4PL curve, the maneuver presents a continuous steering profile with zero steering angle at the ends. Parking slot collision avoidance and steering limit of the vehicle are satisfied by deducing closed-form analytic conditions on the two design parameters. Together with the robustness to intermediate point variation, comparison with existing approaches highlights computational and design advantages. The proposed approach is validated using a double-tracked Ackermann steering vehicle model.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8264750,IEEE Robotics and Automation Letters,2018
Vehicle Positioning in GNSS-Deprived Urban Areas by Stereo Visual-Inertial Odometry,"Accurate and continuous positioning in global navigation satellite system (GNSS) deprived urban areas is crucial for autonomous vehicles and mobile mapping systems. To achieve this goal, we propose a stereo visual-inertial odometry approach using a multistate constraint Kalman filter (MSCKF). In contrast with the conventional MSCKF, in which an inertial navigation system (INS) propagates the vehicle motion, and then the propagation is corrected by measurements of salient features extracted from images of a single camera, we update the propagation with observations extracted from images of a stereo pair of cameras. This way, additional constraints across the stereo pairs of images are exploited to improve the pose estimation. Experimental results on several KITTI datasets show that the stereo MSCKF outperforms the mono one achieving an average positioning error of 0.9% of the trajectory length compared to 1.3% for the mono approach and 2.5% for INS-only integration. These results show that visual-inertial odometry has a promising potential for vehicle positioning in short periods of GNSS signal outage.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8286957,IEEE Transactions on Intelligent Vehicles,2018
Fast Genetic Algorithm Path Planner for Fixed-Wing Military UAV Using GPU,"Military unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) are employed in highly dynamic environments and must often adjust their trajectories based on the evolving situation. To operate autonomously and safely, a UAV must be equipped with a path planning module capable of quickly recalculating a feasible and quasi-optimal path in flight while in the event a new obstacle or threat has been detected or simply if the destination point is changed during the mission. To allow for a fast path planning, this paper proposes a parallel implementation of the genetic algorithm on graphics processing unit (GPU). The trajectories are built as series of line segments connected by circular arcs resulting in smooth paths suitable for fixed-wing UAVs. The fitness function we defined takes into account the dynamic constraints of the UAVs and aims to minimize fuel consumption and average flying altitude in order to improve range and avoid detection by enemy radars. This fitness function is also implemented on the GPU and different parallelization strategies were developed and tested for each step of the fitness evaluation. By exploiting the massively parallel architecture of GPUs, the execution time of the proposed path planner was reduced by a factor of 290x compared to a sequential execution on CPU. The path planning module developed was tested using 18 scenarios on six realistic three-dimensional terrains with multiple no-fly zones. We found that the proposed GPU-based path planner was able to find quasi-optimal solutions in a timely fashion allowing in-flight planning.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8294239,IEEE Transactions on Aerospace and Electronic Systems,2018
A Real-Time Battery Thermal Management Strategy for Connected and Automated Hybrid Electric Vehicles (CAHEVs) Based on Iterative Dynamic Programming,"Connected and automated hybrid electric vehicles (CAHEVs) are a potential solution to the future transportation due to their improved fuel economy, reduced emissions, and capability to mitigate congestion and improve safety. The battery thermal management (BTM) in CAHEVs is one of the crucial problems, because the lithium-ion batteries are highly temperature sensitive. Therefore, a practical and energy-efficient BTM strategy is required for both improving the operating temperature of batteries and saving energy. In this study, the dynamic programming (DP) is implemented for a BTM system in CAHEVs for achieving the optimal cooling/heating energy savings for batteries. To enhance the real-time capability, an iterative approach is proposed to approximate the optimum control strategy iteratively in a multidimensional search space. The proposed iterative DP strategy can improve the system performance and energy-efficiency by fully exploiting the future road information in CAHEVs combined with a model predictive control method. The hardware-in-the-loop validation of the proposed strategy is conducted on the UDDS and the WLTC drive cycles based on a Toyota Prius PHEV model. The results demonstrate the feasibility and effectiveness of the proposed BTM strategy that leads to a considerable BTM energy reduction.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8373733,IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology,2018
Capacity Analysis of UAV Communications: Cases of Random Trajectories,"This paper analyzes the link capacity between autonomous unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) with random three-dimensional (3-D) trajectories. This is distinctively different from existing works typically under the assumption of either two-dimensional (2-D) or deterministic trajectories, and particularly interesting to applications such as surveillance and air combat. The key idea is that we geometrically derive the probability distributions of the UAV-to-UAV (U2U) distances which, by exploiting the Jensen's inequality, can be translated to the closed-form bounds for the capacity between UAVs, and between UAVs and ground stations. Another important aspect is that we extrapolate the idea to dense UAV networks, and analyze the impact of network densification, imperfect channel state information, and interference from ground transmitters on the capacity. Corroborated by simulations, our analysis shows that a U2U link with random 2-D trajectories is superior in terms of capacity due to its short average link distance. It is also revealed that a UAV-to-ground link can incur substantially lower capacity than a U2U link even in the case the 3-D coverage of the UAVs is the same, as the result of its longer average link length.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8345703,IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology,2018
UAV Relay in VANETs Against Smart Jamming With Reinforcement Learning,"Frequency hopping-based antijamming techniques are not always applicable in vehicular ad hoc networks (VANETs) due to the high mobility of onboard units (OBUs) and the large-scale network topology. In this paper, we use unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) to relay the message of an OBU and improve the communication performance of VANETs against smart jammers that observe the ongoing OBU and UAV communication status and even induce the UAV to use a specific relay strategy and then attack it accordingly. More specifically, the UAV relays the OBU message to another roadside unit (RSU) with a better radio transmission condition if the serving RSU is heavily jammed or interfered. The interactions between a UAV and a smart jammer are formulated as an antijamming UAV relay game, in which the UAV decides whether or not to relay the OBU message to another RSU, and the jammer observes the UAV and the VANET strategy and chooses the jamming power accordingly. The Nash equilibria of the UAV relay game are derived to reveal how the optimal UAV relay strategy depends on the transmit cost and the UAV channel model. A hotbooting policy hill climbing-based UAV relay strategy is proposed to help the VANET resist jamming in the dynamic game without being aware of the VANET model and the jamming model. Simulation results show that the proposed relay strategy can efficiently reduce the bit error rate of the OBU message and thus increase the utility of the VANET compared with a Q-learning-based scheme.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8246580,IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology,2018
Context-Based Filtering of Noisy Labels for Automatic Basemap Updating From UAV Data,"Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) have the potential to obtain high-resolution aerial imagery at frequent intervals, making them a valuable tool for urban planners who require up-to-date basemaps. Supervised classification methods can be exploited to translate the UAV data into such basemaps. However, these methods require labeled training samples, the collection of which may be complex and time consuming. Existing spatial datasets can be exploited to provide the training labels, but these often contain errors due to differences in the date or resolution of the dataset from which these outdated labels were obtained. In this paper, we propose an approach for updating basemaps using global and local contextual cues to automatically remove unreliable samples from the training set, and thereby, improve the classification accuracy. Using UAV datasets over Kigali, Rwanda, and Dar es Salaam, Tanzania, we demonstrate how the amount of mislabeled training samples can be reduced by 44.1% and 35.5%, respectively, leading to a classification accuracy of 92.1% in Kigali and 91.3% in Dar es Salaam. To achieve the same accuracy in Dar es Salaam, between 50000 and 60000 manually labeled image segments would be needed. This demonstrates that the proposed approach of using outdated spatial data to provide labels and iteratively removing unreliable samples is a viable method for obtaining high classification accuracies while reducing the costly step of acquiring labeled training samples.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8103751,IEEE Journal of Selected Topics in Applied Earth Observations and Remote Sensing,2018
Lateral Control of an Autonomous Vehicle,"The asymptotic stabilization problem for a class of nonlinear under-actuated systems is studied and solved. Its solution, together with the back-stepping and the forwarding control design methods, is exploited in the control of the nonlinear lateral dynamics of a vehicle. Even though the theoretical studies of the lateral control of autonomous vehicles are traditionally applied to lane keeping cases, the results can be applied to broader range of areas, such as lane changing cases. The comparison between the performances of the closed-loop systems with the given controller and a typical human driver is given and demonstrates the speediness and the effectiveness of the feedback controller.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8286943,IEEE Transactions on Intelligent Vehicles,2018
Robust Trajectory and Transmit Power Design for Secure UAV Communications,"Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) are anticipated to be widely deployed in future wireless communications, due to their advantages of high mobility and easy deployment. However, the broadcast nature of airto-ground line-of-sight wireless channels brings a new challenge to the information security of UAV-ground communication. This paper tackles such a challenge in the physical layer by exploiting the mobility of UAV via its trajectory design. We consider a UAV-ground communication system with multiple potential eavesdroppers on the ground, where the information on the locations of the eavesdroppers is imperfect. We formulate an optimization problem, which maximizes the average worst case secrecy rate of the system by jointly designing the robust trajectory and transmit power of the UAV over a given flight duration. The nonconvexity of the optimization problem and the imperfect location information of the eavesdroppers make the problem difficult to be solved optimally. We propose an iterative suboptimal algorithm to solve this problem efficiently by applying the block coordinate descent method, S-procedure, and successive convex optimization method. Simulation results show that the proposed algorithm can improve the average worst case secrecy rate significantly, as compared to two other benchmark algorithms without robust design.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8392472,IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology,2018
AC-POCA: Anticoordination Game Based Partially Overlapping Channels Assignment in Combined UAV and D2D-Based Networks,"Device-to-device (D2D)-enabled wireless networks are becoming increasingly popular. However, in remote, rural, and disaster affected areas, it is difficult to construct such wireless networks due to the unavailability or inadequacy of cellular infrastructures. Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) can be a good candidate to promptly construct the D2D-enabled wireless network. However, the assignment of the radio channels of the nodes (i.e., UAVs and user terminals) is challenging due to the availability of only a limited number of orthogonal channels and the interference issue resulted from using arbitrary channels. Furthermore, the dynamic topology and high mobility of nodes in such a combined UAV and D2D-based network make conventional channel assignment (CA) algorithm no longer suitable. In this paper, we formally address this problem, and demonstrate how partially overlapping channels (POCs) and game theory can be exploited to alleviate the problem. In this vein, we propose a distributed anticoordination game based POC assignment algorithm referred to as AC-POCA. In our proposed AC-POCA, the nodes use only local information to play the game, and reach a steady state, uniqueness of which is verified through analysis. Also, the upper bound of AC-POCA (i.e., price of anarchy) is analytically evaluated, which is corroborated by simulation results. In addition, simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness of AC-POCA in terms of good throughput and low signaling overhead in a dynamic environment.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8039268,IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology,2018
Long Short-Term Memory Networks for Accurate State-of-Charge Estimation of Li-ion Batteries,"State of charge (SOC) estimation is critical to the safe and reliable operation of Li-ion battery packs, which nowadays are becoming increasingly used in electric vehicles (EVs), Hybrid EVs, unmanned aerial vehicles, and smart grid systems. We introduce a new method to perform accurate SOC estimation for Li-ion batteries using a recurrent neural network (RNN) with long short-term memory (LSTM). We showcase the LSTM-RNN's ability to encode dependencies in time and accurately estimate SOC without using any battery models, filters, or inference systems like Kalman filters. In addition, this machine-learning technique, like all others, is capable of generalizing the abstractions it learns during training to other datasets taken under different conditions. Therefore, we exploit this feature by training an LSTM-RNN model over datasets recorded at various ambient temperatures, leading to a single network that can properly estimate SOC at different ambient temperature conditions. The LSTM-RNN achieves a low mean absolute error (MAE) of 0.573% at a fixed ambient temperature and an MAE of 1.606% on a dataset with ambient temperature increasing from 10 to 25 °C.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8240689,IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics,2018
Hierarchical Control Design for a Shipboard Power System With DC Distribution and Energy Storage Aboard Future More-Electric Ships,"DC distribution is now becoming the major trend of future mobile power systems, such as more-electric aircrafts and ships. As dc distribution has different nature to the conventional ac system, a new design of well-structured control and management methods will be mandatory. In this paper, a shipboard power system with dc distribution and energy storage system (ESS) is picked as the study case. To meet the requirement of control and management of such a large-scale mobile power system, a hierarchical control design is proposed in this paper. In order to fully exploit the benefit of the ESS, as well as to overcome the limitation in controllability, a novel inverse-droop control method is proposed, in which the power sharing is according to the source characteristic, instead of their power rating. A frequency-division method is also proposed as an extension to the inverse-droop method for enabling a hybrid ESS and its autonomous operation. On the basis of the proposed methods, the control methods for management and voltage restoration levels are also proposed to establish a comprehensive control solution. Real-time simulations are carried out to validate the performance of the proposed control design under different operating conditions. When compared to more conventional droop-based approaches, the new proposal shows enhancement in efficiency.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8103775,IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics,2018
Secure Automated Valet Parking: A Privacy-Preserving Reservation Scheme for Autonomous Vehicles,"It is believed that automated valet parking (AVP) system has great potential to mitigate the parking headache for the future smart city, as it can provide on-demand parking services, bringing immense benefits from energy saving for vehicles to time saving for drivers. For an AVP system, parking reservation is an indispensable part so that vehicles can accomplish automated parking in accordance with the reserved parking information. However, the reservation requests may not only reveal the driver identity, but also disclose his/her sensitive locations, e.g., the most visited places, which are of great concerns to users. To deal with this challenge, the anonymous techniques can be naturally applied during parking reservation, but directly applying the anonymous techniques in AVP will introduce a new security issue, i.e., the anonymous user may maliciously crash the AVP system by repetitively sending the reservation requests, which is called “double-reservation attack.” In this paper, we propose a new privacy-preserving reservation scheme for securing AVP system. Specifically, each anonymous user must have only one valid reservation token at any moment, and the token can only be used for booking one vacant parking space once. The proposed scheme does not only preserve the user's identity privacy and location privacy but also prevents the “double-reservation attack” based on several elegant building blocks, i.e., zero-knowledge proofs of knowledge and proxy resignature. Detailed security analysis confirms the security properties of our proposed scheme. In addition, extensive simulations are conducted to compare our proposed scheme with three previous schemes, and the experiment results demonstrate that our scheme is also much efficient in a WiFi-based testbed.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8464286,IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology,2018
Detection and Recognition of Traffic Planar Objects Using Colorized Laser Scan and Perspective Distortion Rectification,"Reliable detection and recognition of planar objects including traffic sign, street sign, and road surface in dynamic cluttered natural scenes are a big challenge for self-driving cars. In this paper, we propose a comprehensive method for planar object detection and recognition. First, the data association of LIDAR and camera is set up to acquire colorized laser scans, which simultaneously contain both color and geometrical information. Second, we combine three color spaces of RGB, HSV, and CIE L*a*b* with laser reflectivity as an aggregation-based feature vector. Third, the 3-D geometrical characteristics of planar objects that contain planarity, size, and aspect ratio are exploited to further reduce false alarm. Fourth, in order to increase robustness to any viewpoint variation, we present a new virtual camera-based rectification method to synthesize fronto-parallel views of refined object descriptors in 3-D space. Finally, experimental results achieved under a variety of challenging conditions show that integration of color space aggregation and laser reflectivity is superior to individuals. Specifically, the proposed perspective distortion rectification method remarkably eliminates false recognition error by 45.5%. Overall, the detection rate of our comprehensive method has up to 95.87% and the recognition rate even reaches 95.07% for traffic signs ranging within 100 m, with about 33.25 ms average running time per frame.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8013749,IEEE Transactions on Intelligent Transportation Systems,2018
Learning to Detect Aircraft for Long-Range Vision-Based Sense-and-Avoid Systems,"The commercial use of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) would be enhanced by an ability to sense and avoid potential mid-air collision threats. In this letter, we propose a new approach to aircraft detection for long-range vision-based sense and avoid. We first train a deep convolutional neural network to learn aircraft visual features using flight data of mid-air head-on near-collision course encounters between two fixed-wing aircraft. We then propose an approach that fuses these learnt aircraft features with hand-crafted features that are used by the current state of the art. Finally, we evaluate the performance of our proposed approach on real flight data captured from a UAV, where it achieves a mean detection range of 2527 m and a mean detection range improvement of 299 m (or 13.4%) compared to the current state of the art with no additional false alarms.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8447264,IEEE Robotics and Automation Letters,2018
Obstacle avoidance method of three-dimensional obstacle spherical cap,"Focusing on obstacle avoidance in three-dimensional space for unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV), the direct obstacle avoidance method in dynamic space based on three-dimensional velocity obstacle spherical cap is proposed, which quantifies the influence of threatening obstacles through velocity obstacle spherical cap parameters. In addition, the obstacle avoidance schemes of any point on the critical curve during the multi-obstacles avoidance are given. Through prediction, the insertion point for the obstacle avoidance can be obtained and the flight path can be re-planned. Taking the Pythagorean Hodograph (PH) curve trajectory re-planning as an example, the three-dimensional direct obstacle avoidance method in dynamic space is tested. Simulation results show that the proposed method can realize the online obstacle avoidance trajectory re-planning, which increases the flexibility of obstacle avoidance greatly.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8536788,Journal of Systems Engineering and Electronics,2018
WaterGAN: Unsupervised Generative Network to Enable Real-Time Color Correction of Monocular Underwater Images,"This letter reports on WaterGAN, a generative adversarial network (GAN) for generating realistic underwater images from in-air image and depth pairings in an unsupervised pipeline used for color correction of monocular underwater images. Cameras onboard autonomous and remotely operated vehicles can capture high-resolution images to map the seafloor; however, underwater image formation is subject to the complex process of light propagation through the water column. The raw images retrieved are characteristically different than images taken in air due to effects, such as absorption and scattering, which cause attenuation of light at different rates for different wavelengths. While this physical process is well described theoretically, the model depends on many parameters intrinsic to the water column as well as the structure of the scene. These factors make recovery of these parameters difficult without simplifying assumptions or field calibration; hence, restoration of underwater images is a nontrivial problem. Deep learning has demonstrated great success in modeling complex nonlinear systems but requires a large amount of training data, which is difficult to compile in deep sea environments. Using WaterGAN, we generate a large training dataset of corresponding depth, in-air color images, and realistic underwater images. These data serve as input to a two-stage network for color correction of monocular underwater images. Our proposed pipeline is validated with testing on real data collected from both a pure water test tank and from underwater surveys collected in the field. Source code, sample datasets, and pretrained models are made publicly available.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7995024,IEEE Robotics and Automation Letters,2018
Analyzing and Enhancing the Security of Ultrasonic Sensors for Autonomous Vehicles,"Autonomous vehicles rely on sensors to measure road condition and make driving decisions, and their safety relies heavily on the reliability of these sensors. Out of all obstacle detection sensors, ultrasonic sensors have the largest market share and are expected to be increasingly installed on automobiles. Such sensors discover obstacles by emitting ultrasounds and analyzing their reflections. By exploiting the built-in vulnerabilities of sensors, we designed random spoofing, adaptive spoofing, and jamming attacks on ultrasonic sensors, and we managed to trick a vehicle to stop when it should keep moving, and let it fail to stop when it should. We validate our attacks on stand-alone sensors and moving vehicles, including a Tesla Model S with the “Autopilot” system. The results show that the attacks cause blindness and malfunction of not only sensors but also autonomous vehicles, which can lead to collisions. To enhance the security of ultrasonic sensors and autonomous vehicles, we propose two defense strategies, single-sensor-based physical shift authentication that verifies signals on the physical level, and multiple sensor consistency check that employs multiple sensors to verify signals on the system level. Our experiments on real sensors and MATLAB simulation reveal the validity of both schemes.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8451864,IEEE Internet of Things Journal,2018
IEEE 802.11p and Visible Light Hybrid Communication Based Secure Autonomous Platoon,"Autonomous vehicle platoon is an enhancement of autonomous behavior, where vehicles are organized into groups of close proximity through wireless communication. Platoon members mostly communicate with each other via the current dominant vehicular radio frequency (RF) technology, IEEE 802.11p. However, this technology leads security vulnerabilities under various attacks from adversaries. Visible light communication (VLC) has the potential to alleviate these vulnerabilities by exploiting the directivity and impermeability of light. Utilizing only VLC in vehicle platoon, on the other hand, may degrade platoon stability since VLC is sensitive to environmental effects. In this paper, we propose an IEEE 802.11p and VLC-based hybrid security protocol for platoon communication, namely SP-VLC, with the goal of ensuring platoon stability and securing platoon maneuvers under data packet injection, channel overhearing, jamming, and platoon maneuver attacks. We define platoon maneuver attack based on the identification of various scenarios where a fake maneuver packet is transmitted by a malicious actor. SP-VLC includes mechanisms for the secret key establishment, message authentication, data transmission over both IEEE 802.11p and VLC,jamming detection and reaction to switch to VLC only communication and secure platoon maneuvering based on the joint usage of IEEE 802.11p and VLC. We develop a simulation platform combining realistic vehicle mobility model, realistic VLC and IEEE 802.11p channel models, and vehicle platoon management. We show the functionality of the SP-VLC protocol under all possible security attacks by performing extensive simulations. Ourfindings demonstrate that SPVLC protocol generates less than 0.1% difference in the speed of and distance between platoon members during security attacks in comparison to 25% and 10% in that of previously proposed IEEE 802.11p and IEEE 802.11p-VLC hybrid protocols, respectively.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8365848,IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology,2018
Robust Long-Term Registration of UAV Images of Crop Fields for Precision Agriculture,"Continuous crop monitoring is an important aspect of precision agriculture and requires the registration of sensor data over longer periods of time. Often, fields are monitored using cameras mounted on unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) but strong changes in the visual appearance of the growing crops and the field itself poses serious challenges to conventional image registration methods. In this letter, we present a method for registering images of agricultural fields taken by an UAV over the crop season and present a complete pipeline for computing temporally aligned three-dimensional (3-D) point clouds of the field. Our approach exploits the inherent geometry of the crop arrangement in the field, which remains mostly static over time. This allows us to register the images even in the presence of strong visual changes. To this end, we propose a scale invariant, geometric feature descriptor that encodes the local plant arrangement geometry. The experiments suggest that we are able to register images taken over the crop season, including situations where matching with an off-the-shelf visual descriptor fails. We evaluate the accuracy of our matching system with respect to manually labeled ground truth. We furthermore illustrate that the reconstructed 3-D models are qualitatively correct and the registration results allow for monitoring growth parameters at a per plant level.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8392366,IEEE Robotics and Automation Letters,2018
A Soft Aquatic Actuator for Unsteady Peak Power Amplification,"A soft hydraulic actuator is presented which uses elastic energy storage for the purpose of pulsed-jet propulsion of soft unmanned underwater vehicles. The actuator consists of a flexible membrane that can be inflated using a micropump and whose elastic potential energy may be released on demand using a controllable valve, in a manner inspired by the swimming of squids and octopuses. It is shown that for equivalent initial elastic energy, the drop in peak thrust is linearly proportional to the decrease in nozzle cross section. Peak hydraulic power amplification of the soft actuator of approximately 75% is achieved with respect to that of the driving pump, confirming that passive elasticity can be exploited in aquatic propulsion to replicate the explosive motion skills of agile sea-dwelling creatures.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8477111,IEEE/ASME Transactions on Mechatronics,2018
Multilabel Conditional Random Field Classification for UAV Images,"In this letter, we formulate the multilabeling classification problem of unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) imagery within a conditional random field (CRF) framework with the aim of exploiting simultaneously spatial contextual information and cross-correlation between labels. The pipeline of the framework consists of two main phases. First, the considered input UAV image is subdivided into a grid of tiles, which are processed thanks to an opportune representation and a multilayer perceptron classifier providing thus tile-wise multilabel prediction probabilities. In the second phase, a multilabel CRF model is applied to integrate spatial correlation between adjacent tiles and the correlation between labels within the same tile, with the objective to improve iteratively the multilabel classification map associated with the considered input UAV image. Experimental results achieved on two different UAV image data sets are reported and discussed.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8267483,IEEE Geoscience and Remote Sensing Letters,2018
A Hierarchical Detection and Response System to Enhance Security Against Lethal Cyber-Attacks in UAV Networks,"Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) networks have not yet received considerable research attention. Specifically, security issues are a major concern because such networks, which carry vital information, are prone to various attacks. In this paper, we design and implement a novel intrusion detection and response scheme, which operates at the UAV and ground station levels, to detect malicious anomalies that threaten the network. In this scheme, a set of detection and response techniques are proposed to monitor the UAV behaviors and categorize them into the appropriate list (normal, abnormal, suspect, and malicious) according to the detected cyber-attack. We focus on the most lethal cyber-attacks that can target an UAV network, namely, false information dissemination, GPS spoofing, jamming, and black hole and gray hole attacks. Extensive simulations confirm that the proposed scheme performs well in terms of attack detection even with a large number of UAVs and attackers since it exhibits a high detection rate, a low number of false positives, and prompt detection with a low communication overhead.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7890467,"IEEE Transactions on Systems, Man, and Cybernetics: Systems",2018
"Weapon configuration, allocation and route planning with time windows for multiple unmanned combat air vehicles","Unmanned combat air vehicles (UCAVs) mission planning is a fairly complicated global optimum problem. Military attack missions often employ a fleet of UCAVs equipped with weapons to attack a set of known targets. A UCAV can carry different weapons to accomplish different combat missions. Choice of different weapons will have different effects on the final combat effectiveness. This work presents a mixed integer programming model for simultaneous weapon configuration and route planning of UCAVs, which solves the problem optimally using the IBM ILOG CPLEX optimizer for simple missions.

The experiments demonstrate the performance of the heuristic algorithm in solving the medium scale and large scale problems. Moreover, we give suggestions on how to select the most appropriate algorithm to solve different scale problems.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8536780,Journal of Systems Engineering and Electronics,2018
Collision-Aware Resource Access Scheme for LTE-Based Machine-to-Machine Communications,"Long-term evolution (LTE) network is considered as the most promising infrastructure to provide efficient connectivity for a large number of autonomous machine-type communications devices (MTCDs). In order to improve the random access (RA) throughput of massive access machine-to-machine (M2M) communications over LTE networks, we propose a collision-aware resource access (CARA) scheme to reduce the collisions on the granted physical resource blocks (PRBs). In CARA, the evolved Node B exploits early collision detection of preambles at the first message and informs the MTCDs in the corresponding random access response (RAR) message if it can detect the collision successfully. The collided MTCDs then contend for PRBs access using an appropriate probability for efficient use of granted PRBs. Analytical and numerical performance evaluations of the CARA show that the RA throughput can be improved in comparison with the traditional RA procedure.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8255659,IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology,2018
How Would Surround Vehicles Move? A Unified Framework for Maneuver Classification and Motion Prediction,"Reliable prediction of surround vehicle motion is a critical requirement for path planning for autonomous vehicles. In this paper, we propose a unified framework for surround vehicle maneuver classification and motion prediction that exploits multiple cues, namely, the estimated motion of vehicles, an understanding of typical motion patterns of freeway traffic and intervehicle interaction. We report our results in terms of maneuver classification accuracy and mean and median absolute error of predicted trajectories against the ground truth for real traffic data collected using vehicle mounted sensors on freeways. An ablative analysis is performed to analyze the relative importance of each cue for trajectory prediction. Additionally, an analysis of execution time for the components of the framework is presented. Finally, we present multiple case studies analyzing the outputs of our model for complex traffic scenarios.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8286935,IEEE Transactions on Intelligent Vehicles,2018
Drone Pilot Identification by Classifying Radio-Control Signals,"Analysis of interactions with remotely controlled devices has been used to detect the onset of hijacking attacks, as well as for forensics analysis, e.g., to identify the human controller. Its effectiveness is known to depend on the remote device type as well as on the properties of the remote control signal. This paper shows that the radio control signal sent to an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) using a typical transmitter can be captured and analyzed to identify the controlling pilot using machine learning techniques. Twenty trained pilots have been asked to fly a high-end research drone through three different trajectories. Control data have been collected and used to train multiple classifiers. Best performance has been achieved by a random forest classifier that achieved accuracy around 90% using simple time-domain features. Extensive tests have shown that the classification accuracy depends on the flight trajectory and that the pitch, roll, yaw, and thrust control signals show different levels of significance for pilot identification. This result paves the way to a number of security and forensics applications, including continuous identification of UAV pilots to mitigate the risk of hijacking.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8323415,IEEE Transactions on Information Forensics and Security,2018
Secure Message Communication Protocol Among Vehicles in Smart City,"Secure messages exchange among different vehicles is one of the most challenging tasks in future smart cities. Any malicious activity has the potential to compromise the confidentiality, integrity, and authenticity of messages exchanged between different vehicles. To ensure secure message communication among the vehicles in a smart city environment, a novel scheme using elliptic curve cryptographic (ECC) technique has been presented in this paper. For this purpose, a two-level authentication key exchange scheme has been designed. In the first level authentication, CH s are verified by series of messages exchanged between CHs and the CA. The verified CHs are responsible for authentication of vehicles in the second level authentication, followed by exchange of messages between CH and vehicle. The security analysis using widely accepted Burrows-Abadi-Needham logic, formal security analysis using random oracle model and verification using the widely known automated validation of Internet security protocols and applications (AVISPA) tool, and also the informal security analysis have been done with respect to various types of attacks. Moreover, a comparative analysis of the proposed scheme with existing related schemes reveals that it generates low overhead and latency, and high reliability during messages exchange between vehicles and the CA.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8187745,IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology,2018
Decision-Making Framework for Automated Driving in Highway Environments,"This paper presents a decision-making framework for automated driving in highway environments. The framework is capable of reliably, robustly assessing a given highway situation (with respect to the possibility of collision) and of automatically determining an appropriate maneuver for the situation. It consists of two main components: situation assessment and strategy decision. The situation assessment component utilizes multiple complementary “threat measures” and Bayesian networks in its calculations of “threat levels” at the car and lane level to evaluate the possibility of collisions for a given highway traffic situation. The strategy decision component, designed to generate goal-directed and collision-free behaviors, automatically determines an appropriate maneuver in a given highway situation via a hierarchical state machine-such a machine both reduces the complexity of and extends a strategy model. The types of maneuver determined by the component include both simple maneuvers, such as slowing down to avoid collision with a vehicle in front, and complex maneuvers, such as lane changes and overtaking. The presented decision-making framework is tested and evaluated-both on a closed high-speed test track in simulated traffic with various driving scenarios and on public highways in real traffic through in-vehicle testing-to verify that it can provide sufficiently reliable performance for automated driving in highway environments in terms of safety, reliability, and robustness.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7907201,IEEE Transactions on Intelligent Transportation Systems,2018
Robust and Efficient Relative Pose With a Multi-Camera System for Autonomous Driving in Highly Dynamic Environments,"This paper studies the relative pose problem for autonomous vehicles driving in highly dynamic and possibly cluttered environments. This is a challenging scenario due to the existence of multiple, large, and independently moving objects in the environment, which often leads to an excessive portion of outliers and results in erroneous motion estimation. Existing algorithms cannot cope with such situations well. This paper proposes a new algorithm for relative pose estimation using a multi-camera system with multiple non-overlapping cameras. The method works robustly even when the number of outliers is overwhelming. By exploiting specific prior knowledge of the autonomous driving scene, we have developed an efficient 4-point algorithm for multi-camera relative pose estimation, which admits analytic solutions by solving a polynomial root finding equation, and runs extremely fast (at about 0.5 μs per root). When the solver is used in combination with a new random sample consensus sampling scheme by exploiting the conjugate motion constraint, we are able to quickly prune unpromising hypotheses and significantly improve the chance of finding inliers. Experiments on synthetic data have validated the performance of the proposed algorithm. Tests on real data further confirm the method's practical relevance.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8053815,IEEE Transactions on Intelligent Transportation Systems,2018
Self-Localization Based on Visual Lane Marking Maps: An Accurate Low-Cost Approach for Autonomous Driving,"Autonomous driving in public roads requires precise localization within the range of few centimeters. Even the best localization systems based on GNSS cannot always reach this level of precision, especially in an urban environment, where the signal is disturbed by surrounding buildings and artifacts. Recent works have shown the advantage of using maps as a precise, robust, and reliable way of localization. Typical approaches use the set of current readings from the vehicle sensors to estimate its position on the map. The approach presented in this paper exploits a short-range visual lane marking detector and a dead reckoning system to construct a registry of the detected back lane markings corresponding to the last 240 m driven. This information is used to search in the map the most similar section, to determine the vehicle localization in the map reference. Additional filtering is used to obtain a more robust estimation for the localization. The accuracy obtained is sufficiently high to allow autonomous driving in a narrow road. The system uses a low-cost architecture of sensors and the algorithm is light enough to run on low-power embedded architecture.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8063437,IEEE Transactions on Intelligent Transportation Systems,2018
Spline-Based Motion Planning for Autonomous Guided Vehicles in a Dynamic Environment,"Autonomous vehicles require a collision-free motion trajectory at every time instant. This brief presents an optimization-based method to calculate such trajectories for autonomous vehicles operating in an uncertain environment with moving obstacles. The proposed approach applies to linear system models, as well as to a particular class of nonlinear models, including industrially relevant vehicles, such as autonomous guided vehicles with front wheel, differential wheel, and rear-wheel steering. The method computes smooth motion trajectories, satisfying the vehicle's kinematics, by using a spline parameterization. Furthermore, it exploits spline properties to keep the resulting nonlinear optimization problem small scale and to guarantee constraint satisfaction, without the need for time gridding. The resulting problem is solved sufficiently fast for online motion planning, dealing with uncertainties and changes in the environment. This brief demonstrates the potential of the method with extensive numerical simulations. In addition, it presents an experimental validation in which a KUKA youBot, steered as a holonomic or differential drive vehicle, drives through an environment with moving obstacles. To facilitate the further development and the numerical and experimental validation of the presented method, it is embodied in a user-friendly open-source software toolbox.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8022960,IEEE Transactions on Control Systems Technology,2018
User-Centric View of Unmanned Aerial Vehicle Transmission Against Smart Attacks,"Unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) systems are vulnerable to smart attackers, who are selfish and subjective end-users and use smart radio devices to change their attack types and policies based on the ongoing UAV transmission and network states. In this paper, we apply prospect theory to formulate a subjective smart attack game for the UAV transmission, in which a smart attacker Eve makes subjective decisions to choose the attack type such as jamming, spoofing, and eavesdropping without knowing the attack detection accuracy of the UAV system, and the UAV transmit power on multiple radio channels is chosen to resist smart attacks. Reinforcement-learning-based UAV power allocation strategies are proposed to achieve the optimal power allocation against smart attacks without knowing the attack model and the channel model in the dynamic game. A deep Q-learning-based UAV power allocation strategy combines Q-learning and deep learning to accelerate the learning speed for the case with a large number of channel states and attack modes. Simulation results show that our proposed UAV power allocation strategy can suppress the attack motivation of subjective smart attackers and increase the secrecy capacity and the utility of the UAV system.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8231220,IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology,2018
Urban Traffic Density Estimation Based on Ultrahigh-Resolution UAV Video and Deep Neural Network,"This paper presents an advanced urban traffic density estimation solution using the latest deep learning techniques to intelligently process ultrahigh-resolution traffic videos taken from an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV). We first capture nearly an hour-long ultrahigh-resolution traffic video at five busy road intersections of a modern megacity by flying a UAV during the rush hours. We then randomly sampled over 17 K 512×512 pixel image patches from the video frames and manually annotated over 64 K vehicles to form a dataset for this paper, which will also be made available to the research community for research purposes. Our innovative urban traffics analysis solution consists of an advanced deep neural network (DNN) based vehicle detection and localization, type (car, bus, and truck) recognition, tracking, and vehicle counting over time. We will present extensive experimental results to demonstrate the effectiveness of our solution. We will show that our enhanced single shot multibox detector (Enhanced-SSD) outperforms other DNN-based techniques and that deep learning techniques are more effective than traditional computer vision techniques in traffic video analysis. We will also show that ultrahigh-resolution video provides more information that enables more accurate vehicle detection and recognition than lower resolution contents.

Combating the Control Signal Spoofing Attack in UAV Systems,"Unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) system is vulnerable to the control signal spoofing attack due to the openness of the wireless communications. In this correspondence, a physical layer approach is proposed to combat the control signal spoofing attack, i.e., to determine whether the received control signal packet is from the ground control station or a potential malicious attacker (MA), which does not need to share any secret key. We consider the worst case where the UAV does not have any prior knowledge about the MA. Utilizing the channel feature of the angles of arrival, the distance-based path loss, and the Rician-$\kappa$ factor, we construct a generalized log-likelihood radio test framework to handle the problem.

An Adaptive Spacing Policy Guaranteeing String Stability in Multi-Brand Ad Hoc Platoons,"A method is presented for the longitudinal control of autonomous vehicles forming a multi-brand, ad hoc platoon. A leader and predecessor following (LPF) control architecture is known to allow string stable platooning with shorter safety gaps between vehicles as compared with predecessor following schemes. General LPF strategies, however, require the exact knowledge of spacing policies of predecessor vehicles for correctly specifying a spacing with respect to the leader. It follows that arbitrary spacing policies in ad hoc platoons prevent the applicability of classical LPF control structures. It is shown in this paper that it is possible to exploit the advantages of LPF architectures in multi-brand platoons without a priori knowledge of spacing policies of predecessors. The unknown spacing policies are replaced by a virtual one, which serves as an input to a two degree of freedom LPF controller. The resulting control structure enables the organization of ad hoc platoons consisting of vehicles with different spacing policies. Computer simulations are presented to illustrate the statements.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8053789,IEEE Transactions on Intelligent Transportation Systems,2018
Multiantenna GNSS and Inertial Sensors/Odometer Coupling for Robust Vehicular Navigation,"Location information is one of the most vital information required to achieve intelligence and context-awareness for Internet of Things applications such as driverless cars. However, related security and privacy threats are a major holdback. With increasing focus on the use global navigation satellite system (GNSS) for autonomous navigation and related applications, it is important to provide robust navigation solutions. Radio frequency interference, either intentional or unintentional, has a direct impact on GNSS navigation performance related to observability and accuracy. In terms of security, spoofing is the major issue of concern. This paper focuses on multiantenna GNSS and inertial navigation system (INS)-odometer integration to improve robustness, security, and privacy of navigation solutions. Multiantenna GNSS provides robustness against different interference sources and integration with INS provides continuous navigation solutions during short-term signal outages.

Consumer Drones Targeting by Sodar (Acoustic Radar),"Consumer drones have recently become a threat in many real scenarios, since they are difficult to detect and track, and can be easily used to perform criminal activities such as smuggling of illicit materials, surveillance operations or network hacking, and stealing data. Existing technologies are either not suitable to detect an object that can be as small as 10 cm, or quite expensive and complicated to deploy. We carried out a field experiment to explore the possibility of tuning a well-known, low-cost acoustic radar (sodar), commonly used in atmospheric physics, to detect and track consumer drones. The vertical position of a small drone retrieved by a single-sodar antenna turned out to be in good agreement with that measured by its onboard GPS (correlation coefficient 0.93), and no significant bias was observed. Despite being preliminary, these results support the use of such a technique to retrieve reliably the position of small unmanned aerial vehicles.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8430530,IEEE Geoscience and Remote Sensing Letters,2018

First of all, the IGC system model of the UCAV is built based on the three-channel independent design idea, which reduces the difsculties of designing the controller. Then, IGC control laws are designed using the trajectory linearization control (TLC). A nonlinear disturbance observer (NDO) is introduced to the IGC controller to reject various uncertainties, such as the aerodynamic parameter perturbation and the measurement error interference. The stability of the closed-loop system is proven by using the Lyapunov theorem. The performance of the proposed IGC design method is verised in a terminal attack mission of the suicide UCAV. Finally, simulation results demonstrate the superiority and effectiveness in the aspects of guidance accuracy and system robustness.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7978027,Journal of Systems Engineering and Electronics,2017
Estimation of Synchromesh Frictional Torque and Output Torque in a Clutchless Automated Manual Transmission of a Parallel Hybrid Electric Vehicle,"This paper studies the estimation of the synchromesh frictional torque and the output torque of the integrated system of an electric motor and a clutchless automated manual transmission (AMT) as part of a two-shaft parallel hybrid electric vehicle powertrain. The case study powertrain is discussed, and the dynamical model of the powertrain from the electric motor to the AMT output shaft, where it is linked to the torque coupler, is developed constituting the basis for the observer design. Given the fact that the aforementioned torques are unknown inputs to the system, they are modeled as state variables of a fictitious unforced linear time-invariant system in order to be aggregated into the systems dynamics. For the augmented system of the actual and fictitious states, a deterministic Luenberger observer and a stochastic Kalman-Bucy filter (KBF) are designed to estimate the synchromesh frictional torque and the output torque of the AMT. The estimation is based on measuring angular velocities of the electric motor and the AMT output shaft, together with the imparted electromagnetic torque of the traction motor on the system. A set of experiments with distinct scenarios is performed to compare the performance of the designed observers and to quantify by how much the KBF can improve the root-mean-square error (RMSE) of the estimation by mitigating the effect of the process and measurement noises. Ultimately, after validation of the designed observers, the estimated value of the synchromesh frictional torque is exploited in a closed-loop feedback configuration in order to track desired trajectories such as step, ramp, and sinusoidal torque commands.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7604128,IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology,2017
Reactive Obstacle Avoidance for Highly Maneuverable Vehicles Based on a Two-Stage Optical Flow Clustering,"This paper proposes a reactive obstacle avoidance approach based solely on image data from a monocular camera stream. By clustering and analyzing the optical flow, this approach is able to identify potential collisions with dynamic obstacles. Epipolar geometry is exploited to derive velocity commands that ensure a collision-free path for a highly maneuverable autonomous vehicle via a real-time optimizer. First, the underlying image processing and optimization principles are explained in detail, before simulation results show the general feasibility of the approach. Finally, real-world tests with the ROboMObil, the German Aerospace Center's robotic electric vehicle, are provided to demonstrate its applicability.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7782362,IEEE Transactions on Intelligent Transportation Systems,2017
Using Extreme Value Theory for Vehicle Level Safety Validation and Implications for Autonomous Vehicles,"Much effort is put right now into how to make autonomous vehicles as capable as possible in order to be able to replace humans as drivers. Less focus is put into how to ensure that this transition happens in a safe way that we can put trust in. The verification of the extreme dependability requirements connected to safety is expected to be one of the largest challenges to overcome in the commercialization of autonomous vehicles. Using traditional statistical methods to validate complete vehicle safety would require the vehicle to cover extreme distances to show that collisions occur rare enough. However, recent research has shown the possibility of using near-collisions in order to estimate the frequency of actual collisions using Extreme Value Theory. To use this method, there is a need for a measure related to the closeness of a collision. This paper shows that the choice of this threat measure has a significant impact on the inferences drawn from the data. With the right measure, this method can be used to validate the safety of a vehicle. This, while keeping the validity high and the data required lower than the state of the art statistical methods.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8094027,IEEE Transactions on Intelligent Vehicles,2017
An Inertial-Aided Homography-Based Visual Servo Control Approach for (Almost) Fully Actuated Autonomous Underwater Vehicles,"A nonlinear inertial-aided image-based visual servo control approach for the stabilization of (almost) fully actuated autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs) is proposed. It makes use of the homography matrix between two images of a planar scene as feedback information while the system dynamics are exploited in a cascade manner in a control design: An outer-loop control defines a reference setpoint based on the homography matrix and an inner-loop control ensures the stabilization of the setpoint by assigning the thrust and torque controls. Unlike conventional solutions that only consider the system kinematics, the proposed control scheme is novel in considering the full system dynamics (incorporating all degrees of freedom, nonlinearities, and couplings, as well as interactions with the surrounding fluid) and in not requiring information of the relative depth and normal vector of the observed scene. Augmented with integral corrections, the proposed controller is robust with respect to model uncertainties and disturbances. The almost global asymptotic stability of the closed-loop system is demonstrated, which is the largest domain of attraction one can achieve by means of continuous feedback control. Simulation results illustrating these properties on a realistic AUV model subjected to a sea current are presented and finally experimental results on a real AUV are reported.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7938759,IEEE Transactions on Robotics,2017
Authorship Attribution for Social Media Forensics,"The veil of anonymity provided by smartphones with pre-paid SIM cards, public Wi-Fi hotspots, and distributed networks like Tor has drastically complicated the task of identifying users of social media during forensic investigations. In some cases, the text of a single posted message will be the only clue to an author's identity. How can we accurately predict who that author might be when the message may never exceed 140 characters on a service like Twitter? For the past 50 years, linguists, computer scientists, and scholars of the humanities have been jointly developing automated methods to identify authors based on the style of their writing. All authors possess peculiarities of habit that influence the form and content of their written works. These characteristics can often be quantified and measured using machine learning algorithms. In this paper, we provide a comprehensive review of the methods of authorship attribution that can be applied to the problem of social media forensics. Furthermore, we examine emerging supervised learning-based methods that are effective for small sample sizes, and provide step-by-step explanations for several scalable approaches as instructional case studies for newcomers to the field. We argue that there is a significant need in forensics for new authorship attribution algorithms that can exploit context, can process multi-modal data, and are tolerant to incomplete knowledge of the space of all possible authors at training time.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7555393,IEEE Transactions on Information Forensics and Security,2017
Sensitivity Analysis for Building Energy Simulation Model Calibration via Algorithmic Differentiation,"High-fidelity building energy simulation models are software tools that are built on the well-established physical laws of thermal/hygric processes to model heating, cooling, lighting, ventilation, and energy use of buildings. They are highly nonlinear systems that involve a large number of subroutine calls and submodel switches during execution. To calibrate a building energy simulation model with good quality, parameter sensitivity analysis is well advocated, since it aims to identify those parameters in a specific building that hold more influence on the building thermal performance than others to facilitate shortening the lengthy cycle of model calibration procedures. Since simulation models are given in a large piece of source codes and encapsulate a series of submodels, the prevailing sensitivity analysis is mostly built within the framework of Monte Carlo simulation and statistics-based random sampling methods. It is computationally intensive. We propose to perform such analysis via a differential sensitivity analysis method that relies on the estimation of derivatives. A key technical challenge is that the high nonlinearity of the model prohibits any analytical differentiation, while numerical differentiation is too sensitive to step size and suffers from a truncation error. We, hence, propose to adopt an algorithmic differentiation method, which exploits the operator overload feature of object-oriented programs, to obtain accurate and robust numerical estimations of derivatives in an automated and computationally efficient way.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7508978,IEEE Transactions on Automation Science and Engineering,2017
A Semantic-Enabled Social Network of Devices for Building Automation,"The progress of building automation devices and networks is curbed by application models with limited device autonomy, static configuration scenarios, and frequent explicit user interaction. This paper presents a novel approach inspired to social network interactions for increased object self-configuration and self-orchestration in home and building automation. Objects become autonomous social agents, interacting and coordinating automatically as new information about the environment is available. The framework is grounded on a service-oriented architecture for encapsulating, exchanging, and composing device capabilities and on semantic-based service description, discovery and aggregation exploiting nonstandard inference services. The proposed approach was implemented in two different testbeds and experimental evaluations of feasibility and performance were carried out with respect to a home automation case study.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7911227,IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics,2017
Object Matching for Inter-Vehicle Communication Systems—An IMM-Based Track Association Approach With Sequential Multiple Hypothesis Test,"Autonomous driving poses unique challenges for vehicle environment perception due to the complex driving environment where the autonomous vehicle interacts with surrounding traffic participants. Due to the limited capability of any sensor perception system, it is highly desirable that an autonomous driving vehicle could use not only information from onboard sensors (say, radar/camera/lidar) but also from remote (network) information via inter-vehicle communication systems. The collaborative information from cooperative/non-cooperative remote vehicles (along with the onboard sensor data) could substantially improve the vehicle decision making process and push autonomous driving to be safer and more reliable. Inter-vehicle communication technologies are at the stage of development for market introduction, after years of research and standardization. In this paper, we setup a dedicated short range communication (DSRC) system to provide a low-latency inter-vehicle wireless communication channel. The task is to build a record linkage between the onboard sensor data and the corresponding DSRC-transmitted remote vehicle information when both sets belong to the same object, for the purpose of enhancing host vehicle environment perceiving capability and reliability. This is a typical data association problem. The challenges mainly lie in the inherent uncertain nature of the observation data and the practical issues that information often suffers from delays and drops. We propose a track-based association approach using an interacting multiple model estimator with a sequential multiple hypothesis test (denoted as IMM-SMHT) as an ubiquitous solution to handle different situations in complicated driving scenarios. To fully exploit the potential of such a system, only position information (from the DSRC channel and onboard radar system) is used for the object matching purpose-we try to use the least amount of information to achieve a high association accuracy; additional information can be used but not currently considered. We aim to provide a real world solution, and therefore, a prototype vehicle system is built with practical consideration on market availability, cost, and sensor limitations. We design meaningful use cases for creating functionality modules from a systematic point of view. The inter-vehicle information fusion system based on the track fusion approach using the IMM-SMHT is tested in real traffic on the U.S. roads and shows promising object matching performance of significant practical feasibility.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8039424,IEEE Transactions on Intelligent Transportation Systems,2017
A Deep Learning Approach to UAV Image Multilabeling,"In this letter, we face the problem of multilabeling unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) imagery, typically characterized by a high level of information content, by proposing a novel method based on convolutional neural networks. These are exploited as a means to yield a powerful description of the query image, which is analyzed after subdividing it into a grid of tiles. The multilabel classification task of each tile is performed by the combination of a radial basis function neural network and a multilabeling layer (ML) composed of customized thresholding operations. Experiments conducted on two different UAV image data sets demonstrate the promising capability of the proposed method compared to the state of the art, at the expense of a higher but still contained computation time.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7885056,IEEE Geoscience and Remote Sensing Letters,2017
Control of a City Road Network: Distributed Exact Verification of Traffic Safety,"A least-restrictive supervisor for vehicle collision avoidance is a control algorithm that can detect an unsafe maneuver by a set of human-driven or autonomous vehicles, intervening with a corrective action only when needed to avoid a collision. It can help prevent collisions, and facilitate coexistence of autonomous and human-driven vehicles. Such an algorithm is based on a formal verification problem which, unfortunately, is known to be NP-hard in many cases of interest, for instance at traffic intersections. Here, we propose a strategy to dynamically decompose the formal verification problem of a large road network, exploiting vehicle dynamics and the constraints induced by road topology to separate nonconflicting vehicles. We split the global problem into smaller and treatable subproblems, while still allowing to compute an exact solution. We illustrate our results on three different scenarios.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7867800,IEEE Transactions on Automatic Control,2017
Intrusion Detection and Ejection Framework Against Lethal Attacks in UAV-Aided Networks: A Bayesian Game-Theoretic Methodology,"Advances in wireless communications and microelectronics have spearheaded the development of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), which can be used to augment a ground network composed of sensors and/or vehicles in order to increase coverage, enhance the end-to-end delay, and improve data processing. While UAV-aided networks can potentially find applications in many areas, a number of issues, particularly security, have not been readily addressed. The intrusion detection system is the most commonly used technique to detect attackers. In this paper, we focus on addressing two main issues within the context of intrusion detection and attacker ejection in UAV-aided networks, namely, activation of the intrusion monitoring process and attacker ejection. In fact, when a large number of nodes activate their monitoring processes, the incurred overhead can be substantial and, as a consequence, degrades the network performance. Therefore, a tradeoff between the intrusion detection rate and overhead is considered in this work. It is not always the best strategy to eject a node immediately when it exhibits a bad sign of malicious activities since this sign could be provisional (the node may switch to a normal behavior in the future) or be simply due to noise or unreliable communications. Thus, a dilemma between detection and false positive rates is taken into account in this paper. We propose to address these two security issues by a Bayesian game model in order to accurately detect attacks (i.e., high detection and low false positive rates) with a low overhead. Simulation results have demonstrated that our proposed security game framework does achieve reliable detection.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7549080,IEEE Transactions on Intelligent Transportation Systems,2017
Combined Speed and Steering Control in High-Speed Autonomous Ground Vehicles for Obstacle Avoidance Using Model Predictive Control,"This paper presents a model predictive control-based obstacle avoidance algorithm for autonomous ground vehicles at high speed in unstructured environments. The novelty of the algorithm is its capability to control the vehicle to avoid obstacles at high speed taking into account dynamical safety constraints through a simultaneous optimization of reference speed and steering angle without a priori knowledge about the environment and without a reference trajectory to follow. Previous work in this specific context optimized only the steering command. In this paper, obstacles are detected using a planar light detection and ranging sensor. A multi-phase optimal control problem is then formulated to simultaneously optimize the reference speed and steering angle within the detection range. Vehicle acceleration capability as a function of speed, as well as stability and handling concerns such as preventing wheel lift-off, are included as constraints in the optimization problem, whereas the cost function is formulated to navigate the vehicle as quickly as possible with smooth control commands. Simulation results show that the proposed algorithm is capable of safely exploiting the dynamic limits of the vehicle while navigating the vehicle through sensed obstacles of different sizes and numbers. It is also shown that the proposed variable speed formulation can significantly improve performance by allowing navigation of obstacle fields that would otherwise not be cleared with steering control alone.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7932889,IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology,2017
Cyber Threats Facing Autonomous and Connected Vehicles: Future Challenges,"Vehicles are currently being developed and sold with increasing levels of connectivity and automation. As with all networked computing devices, increased connectivity often results in a heightened risk of a cyber security attack. Furthermore, increased automation exacerbates any risk by increasing the opportunities for the adversary to implement a successful attack. In this paper, a large volume of publicly accessible literature is reviewed and compartmentalized based on the vulnerabilities identified and mitigation techniques developed. This review highlighted that the majority of studies are reactive and vulnerabilities are often discovered by friendly adversaries (white-hat hackers). Many gaps in the knowledge base were identified. Priority should be given to address these knowledge gaps to minimize future cyber security risks in the connected and autonomous vehicle sector.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7872388,IEEE Transactions on Intelligent Transportation Systems,2017

A Consensus-Based Approach for Platooning with Intervehicular Communications and Its Validation in Realistic Scenarios,"Automated and coordinated vehicles' driving (platooning) is very challenging due to the multibody control complexity and the presence of unreliable time-varying wireless intervehicular communication (IVC). We propose a novel controller for vehicle platooning based on consensus and analytically demonstrate its stability and dynamic properties. Traditional approaches assume the logical control topology as a constraint fixed a priori, and the control law is designed consequently; our approach makes the control topology a design parameter that can be exploited to reconfigure the controller, depending on the needs and characteristics of the scenario. Furthermore, the controller automatically compensates outdated information caused by network losses and delays. The controller is implemented in Plexe, which is a state-of-the-art IVC and mobility simulator that includes basic building blocks for platooning. Analysis and simulations show the controller robustness and performance in several scenarios, including realistic propagation conditions with interference caused by other vehicles. We compare our approach against a controller taken from the literature, which is generally considered among the most performing ones. Finally, we test the proposed controller by implementing the real dynamics (engine, transmission, braking systems, etc.) of heterogeneous vehicles in Plexe and verifying that platoons remain stable and safe, regardless of real-life impairments that cannot be modeled in the analytic solution. The results show the ability of the proposed approach to maintain a stable string of realistic vehicles with different control-communication topologies, even in the presence of strong interference, delays, and fading conditions, providing higher comfort and safety for platoon drivers.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7499858,IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology,2017

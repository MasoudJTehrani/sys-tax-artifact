A UAV-Assisted Authentication Protocol for Internet of Vehicles,"As a component of the Intelligent Transportation System (ITS), Internet of Vehicles (IoV) is becoming increasingly important in the management and construction of urban transportation as it can provide users with a range of applications related to traffic accident warnings, entertainment information, collaborative driving and real-time road information through communication devices on vehicles. However, with the increasing variety of services in the IoV, the growing demand for user traffic and the advances in Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) technology, UAV is introduced into the IoV as a solution, which can relieve the pressure on the communication infrastructure in the network, provide emergency communication services and improve the performance of network services. Due to the openness of IoV and the high-speed movement of vehicles, authentication and privacy issues are among the most pressing issues in IoV. Therefore, the paper proposes a secure and effective authentication protocol for UAV-assisted IoV. The protocol utilises elliptic curve cryptography to assure the security of the authentication. The protocol undergoes proof of security, Burrows-Abadi-Needham (BAN) logic analysis and informal security analysis to ensure secure and mutual authentication, and have a good resistance to known attacks. Furthermore, performance analysis and comparison are conducted to evaluate the efficiency of our protocol. The results indicate that our protocol has superior advantages in overhead.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=10457572,IEEE Transactions on Intelligent Transportation Systems,2024-01-01
Multi-Process Federated Learning With Stacking for Securing 6G-V2X Network Slicing at Cross-Borders,"Being part of the 6G ecosystem vision, Connected and Automated Vehicles (CAVs) will enjoy sophisticated tailored services offering road safety and entertainment for users. As one of the 6G cornerstones, Network Slicing (NS) allows the creation of various customized 6G-V2X (Vehicle-to-Everything) use cases on the same physical infrastructure. However, 6G-NS advances can open up breaches to cyber-attacks aiming to break 6G-V2X Network slices to inflict maximum damage on CAVs and their users. Crossing borders, where CAVs leave their V2X-NS (V2X Network Slice) in the Home Mobile Network Operator (H-MNO) toward a similar V2X-NS in the Visited MNO (V-MNO), is an attractive opportunity to exploit by attackers. Detecting and mitigating attacks, in this case, becomes a priority, confronted by NS requirements and MNOs not ready to share their private data. To this end, this paper proposes a 3GPP-compliant privacy preservation collaborative learning scheme for 6G-NS security, focusing on V2X-NS cross-border areas. Our scheme leverages multi-process Federated Learning (FL) architecture to build efficient V2X-NS security-related models while preserving 6G V2X-NS isolation. In addition, it uses differential privacy-enabled stacking to build up attack detection knowledge at the V2X-NSs and MNOs levels while ensuring privacy preservation. We conducted an experimental study on the 5G-NIDD dataset, which is one of the most realistic publicly available 5G datasets. Our results demonstrate that multi-process FL with stacking can deliver high accuracy while ensuring isolation between 6G-V2X-NSs and privacy preservation between H-MNO and V-MNO.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85187006638&origin=inward,IEEE Transactions on Intelligent Transportation Systems,2024-01-01

"Next Generation Vehicles, Safety, and CybersecurityâThe CMX Framework","Safety, privacy, efficiency and cybersecurity (SPEC) properties are mandatory in vehicular networks. Owing to intrinsic limitations, the V2X framework and related communicating autonomous vehicles are inadequate. We explore the CMX framework (Coordinated Mobility for X = SPEC), Next Generation Vehicles (NGVs), and protocols for safety-critical inter-vehicle communications and agreements that solve problems left open in the V2X framework. Then, we focus on cyberattacks and physical attacks against isolated NGVs and cohorts of NGVs. The cyberphysical security analysis investigates more than 20 attacks and demonstrates that the goal set for CMX is verified. In the presence of attacks, safety is never compromised, possibly at the expense of diminished efficiency.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=10287210,IEEE Transactions on Intelligent Transportation Systems,2024-01-01

Blockchain-Assisted Lightweight Authenticated Key Agreement Security Framework for Smart Vehicles-Enabled Intelligent Transportation System,"Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS) supported by smart vehicles have revolutionized modern transportation, offering a wide range of applications and services, such as electronic toll collection, collision avoidance alarms, real-time parking management, and traffic planning. However, the open communication channels among various entities, including smart vehicles, roadside infrastructure, and fleet management systems, introduce security and privacy vulnerabilities. To address these concerns, we propose a novel security framework, named blockchain-assisted lightweight authenticated key agreement security framework for smart vehicles-enabled ITS (BASF-ITS), which ensures data protection both during transit and while stored on cloud servers. BASF-ITS employs a combination of efficient cryptographic primitives, including hash functions, XOR operator, ASCON, elliptic curve cryptography, and physical unclonable functions (PUF), to design authenticated key agreement schemes. The inclusion of PUF significantly enhances the systemâs resistance to physical attacks, preventing tampering attempts. To ensure data integrity when stored on the cloud, our framework incorporates blockchain technology. By leveraging the immutability and decentralization of the blockchain, BASF-ITS effectively safeguards data at rest, providing an additional layer of security. We rigorously analyze the security of BASF-ITS and demonstrate its strong resistance against potential security ass aults, making it a robust and reliable solution for smart vehicle-enabled ITS. In a comparative analysis with contemporary competing schemes, BASF-ITS emerges as a promising approach, offering superior functionality traits, enhanced security features, and reduced computation, communication, and storage costs. Furthermore, we present a practical implementation of BASF-ITS using blockchain technology, showcasing the computational time versus the âtransactions per blockâ and the ânumber of mined blocksâ, confirming its efficiency and viability in real-world scenarios. Note to PractitionersâThis article is motivated by designing an efficient, lightweight, and anonymous blockchain-enabled authenticated security framework that can fix the security and privacy concerns in insecure environments for ITS applications, such as automated road speed enforcement, collision avoidance alarm systems, and traffic planning and management, etc. Authenticated key agreement schemes are extensively used to secure communications in the ITS environment. However, the existing state-of-the-art schemes are not efficient in terms of performance, are not resilient against potential security attacks, and do not support anonymity, untraceability, and unlinkability. Therefore, we propose the authenticated security framework to secure communication among the participating entities in the ITS environment. It utilizes efficient cryptographic primitives, such as hash function, XOR-operator, ASCON, elliptic curve cryptography, and PUF. It is shown that the proposed framework can be deployed as a robust tool to address the ITS security problems efficiently. Moreover, the proposed framework is lightweight and efficient and can be easily deployed in various ITS applications and other resource-constrained environments. However, the participating entities, such as vehicles and roadside units, must be PUF-enabled to deploy the proposed framework.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85189621544&origin=inward,IEEE Transactions on Automation Science and Engineering,2024-01-01

Blockchain and Reinforcement Neural Network for Trusted Cloud-Enabled IoT Network,"The rapid integration of Internet of Things (IoT) services and applications across various sectors is primarily driven by their ability to process real-time data and create intelligent environments through artificial intelligence for service consumers. However, the security and privacy of data have emerged as significant threats to consumers within IoT networks. Issues such as node tampering, phishing attacks, malicious code injection, malware threats, and the potential for Denial of Service (DoS) attacks pose serious risks to the safety and confidentiality of information. To solve this problem, we propose an integrated autonomous IoT network within a cloud architecture, employing Blockchain technology to heighten network security. The primary goal of this approach is to establish a Heterogeneous Autonomous Network (HAN), wherein data is processed and transmitted through cloud architecture. This network is integrated with a Reinforced Neural Network (RNN) called ClouD_RNN, specifically designed to classify the data perceived and collected by sensors. Further, the collected data is continuously monitored by an autonomous network and classified for fault detection and malicious activity. In addition, network security is enhanced by the Blockchain Adaptive Windowing Meta Optimization Protocol (BAW_MOP). Extensive experimental results validate that our proposed approach significantly outperforms state-of-the-art approaches in terms of throughput, accuracy, end-to-end delay, data delivery ratio, network security, and energy efficiency.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=10375765,IEEE Transactions on Consumer Electronics,2024-01-01

Three-Way Decisions With Pythagorean Fuzzy TOPSIS for Internet of Drones,"The node importance evaluation of the Internet of drones, also called unmanned aerial vehicle swarm network, can assist network administrators in implementing security protection for important nodes, slowing down attacks on important nodes and providing support for network enhancement. Complex network is a strong theoretical tool in modeling, analyzing, and identifying the most important drone nodes. Most researchers utilize single attribute of nodes, such as degree, betweenness centrality, and so on, to perform node importance assessment. However, the methods involved either only consider the local features of nodes or only concentrate on the nodes' participation on the shortest path. Aiming at this problem, in this article, we develop a three-way decisions-based Pythagorean fuzzy technique for order preference by similarity to ideal solution (TOPSIS) model. It selects multiple measures of nodes as attributes to assess node importance. In addition, it considers the Pythagorean fuzzy middle ideal solution that is induced by the new proposed Pythagorean fuzzy operator. Simulation results manifest its feasibility in assessing node importance.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=10502190,IEEE Transactions on Fuzzy Systems,2024-01-01

IdentifierIDS: A Practical Voltage-Based Intrusion Detection System for Real In-Vehicle Networks,"As innovative technologies such as autonomous driving, over-the-air technology, and vehicle-to-everything are widely applied to intelligent connected vehicles, people can gain a more convenient and safer driving experience. Although the application of these technologies facilitates our lives, they also bring a series of vulnerable interfaces (such as 5G, Bluetooth, and WiFi), which pose a significant security threat to existing in-vehicle networks. To address these threats, researchers have proposed two mainstream schemes, including message authentication and intrusion detection system (IDS), where the scheme of message authentication needs to occupy the limited bandwidth of controller area network (CAN) bus. Furthermore, most IDSs either cannot locate the sender of the attack, fail to detect aperiodic malicious frames, or require prior knowledge of which CAN identifiers (IDs) belong to which electronic control units (ECUs). To address these weaknesses, we propose a practical voltage-based IDS named IdentifierIDS for real in-vehicle networks. To the best of our knowledge, it is the first scheme to detect intrusions by establishing a voltage fingerprint for each ID without the need for prior knowledge. This allows IdentifierIDS to detect both periodic and aperiodic malicious frames without occupying the limited bandwidth of the CAN bus. As a self-learning IDS, it can adapt to different in-vehicle networks without the need for customization for them. Experiments on three real vehicles demonstrate the robustness of our scheme in different in-vehicle networks.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85176343843&origin=inward,IEEE Transactions on Information Forensics and Security,2024-01-01
Evaluation Framework for Electric Vehicle Security Risk Assessment,"Electric Vehicles (EVs) seem promising for future transportation to solve environmental concerns and energy management problems. According to Reuters, global car makers plan to invest over half a billion in more efficient and intelligent EVs and batteries. However, there are several challenges in EV mass production, including cybersecurity. Due to the cyber-physical nature of EVs and charging stations, their security and trustworthiness are ongoing challenges. In this study, we identify gaps in the security profiling of EVs and categorize them into five components: 1) charging station security, 2) information privacy, 3) software security, 4) connected vehicle security, and 5) autonomous driving security. Our study provides a comprehensive analysis of identified vulnerabilities, threats, challenges and attacks for different EV security aspects, along with their possible surface/subsurface and countermeasures. We develop a comprehensive security risk assessment framework by first using EV security profiles and mapping identified vulnerabilities to a well-known threat model, STRIDE. Then, we classify the risk levels associated with each vulnerability by setting ground criteria for the impact and likelihood of the threats. Finally, we validate our risk assessment framework by applying the same criteria to eight real-world EV attack scenarios. As a result, researchers can adapt the proposed risk assessment framework to discover threats and assess their risks in EVs and charging station ecosystems.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85171780829&origin=inward,IEEE Transactions on Intelligent Transportation Systems,2024-01-01

Event-Triggered Adaptive Bipartite Secure Consensus Asymptotic Tracking Control for Nonlinear MASs Subject to DoS Attacks,"This paper proposes an adaptive bipartite secure consensus asymptotic tracking control scheme based on event-triggered strategy for the nonlinear multi-agent systems (MASs) under denial-of-service (DoS) attacks. First, by incorporating the concept of shortest path into the hierarchical algorithm, the bipartite consensus control problem in the presence of unbalanced communication topology is successfully addressed. Further, an anti-attack bipartite control strategy by designing the improved forms of the tracking errors and virtual controllers is proposed under DoS attacks. Then, a modified event-triggered mechanism based on the relative threshold strategy is proposed, which can ensure that the bipartite consensus tracking errors converge to zero asymptotically by utilizing the Barbalatâs Lemma. Under the Lyapunov stability theory, it is guaranteed that the outputs of all agents can reach agreement with an identical magnitude but opposite signs and all the signals of the closed-loop MASs are bounded. Finally, the simulation results on the model of damping pendulums are given to verify the efficiency of the proposed secure controller. Note to PractitionersâIn this paper, the adaptive bipartite secure consensus asymptotic tracking control problem is considered for nonlinear MASs subject to DoS attacks, whose models can describe many critical applications, such as bidirectional formation of unmanned vehicles and robots. The research on the secure tracking control problem will be rather complicated yet challenging if the DoS attacks of the communication channels are taken into account in the insecure complex network environment. In addition, the event-triggered mechanism is used to reduce the usage of communication resources, which makes the proposed control scheme more easier to implement and more friendly for control engineers.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=10155624,IEEE Transactions on Automation Science and Engineering,2024-01-01
Formation Control for an UAV Team With Environment-Aware Dynamic Constraints,"State-of-the-art literature on constrained multiagent system operations can only deal with constant or at best time-varying constraint requirements. Such constraint formulations cannot respond well to the dynamic environment and presence of external agents outside of the multiagent system. In this work, we consider a formation tracking problem for a group of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) in the presence of a physical attacker. The safety/performance constraint functions are environment-aware and dynamic in nature, whose formulation depends on certain path parameters and presence of the attacker. The dependence on path ensures adaptation to the dynamic operation environment. The dependence on the attacker ensures swift adjustment based on the relative distances between the attacker and agents. UAV desired paths and desired path speeds can also be both path- and attacker-dependent. Composite barrier functions have been proposed to address the constraint requirements. Neural network is used to approximate unknown attacker velocity, where the ideal weight matrix is learned by adaptive laws. Besides, unknown system parameters and external disturbances are estimated by adaptive laws. The proposed formation architecture can ensure formation tracking errors converge exponentially to small neighborhoods near the equilibrium, with all constraint requirements met. At the end a simulation study further illustrates the proposed scheme and demonstrates its efficacy.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=10183872,IEEE Transactions on Intelligent Vehicles,2024-01-01
A Secure UAV Cooperative Communication Framework: Prospect Theory Based Approach,"Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) have attracted extensive attention from both industry and academia owing to their high mobility, line-of-sight (LoS) characteristics of air-to-ground (A2G) channels, and low cost. However, the broadcast nature of wireless transmission and the LoS characteristics of A2G channels are vulnerable to eavesdropping attacks, which leads to severe security issues. To enhance the security of UAV communication, we propose a framework that multiple UAVs cooperate to resist attacks (MURA). Specifically, we first introduce an efficient incentive scheme based on the coalition game to motivate UAVs to participate in a coalition. By forming a grand coalition, we demonstrate that each individual UAV can maximize its utility. Additionally, we propose a secure UAV communication scheme designed to counter eavesdropping attacks. Two distinct types of scenarios are considered in UAV communication. In a completely rational scenario, in which participants make decisions aiming to maximize their utility, we utilize the Stackelberg game to model the interactions between UAVs and attacker. The existence and uniqueness of the equilibrium solution are proved, and the equilibrium solution is obtained. In the context of an imperfectly rational scenario, we employ the prospect theory (PT) to effectively capture the underlying rationality exhibited by the players. The PT valuations of the players, i.e., UAV and attacker, are deduced in detail. Meanwhile, the convergence of the PT valuations of UAV and attacker is proved. Finally, extensive simulation results show that the proposed scheme can effectively improve the utility of legal UAVs and ensure the security of the UAV networks compared with benchmarks.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85186101883&origin=inward,IEEE Transactions on Mobile Computing,2024-01-01
Anti-Watermarking Stealthy Deception Attacks Against Networked Unmanned Surface Vehicles,"This paper investigates the problem of designing stealthy deception attacks against networked unmanned surface vehicles (USVs) equipped with watermarking detection modules. To overcome the limitations of the existing attack methods affected by watermarking technology, an anti-watermarking stealthy deception attack method is proposed, where two auxiliary estimators are designed to indirectly estimate the compromised system state such that the proposed attacks can deteriorate the performance of USVs without being detected by watermarking modules. Compared with the existing results, the proposed method exhibits better stealthiness. To improve the attack performance, an exponential deception signal model with adjustable parameters is designed, and its destructiveness is analyzed under different conditions. A simulation example is given to demonstrate the effectiveness and superiority of the proposed method.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85188950558&origin=inward,IEEE Transactions on Intelligent Transportation Systems,2024-01-01
Defense and Tolerance Technique Against Attacks and Faults on Leader-Following Multi-USVs,"This study explores the leader-following consensus tracking control issue of multiple unmanned surface vehicles (multi-USVs) in the presence of malicious connectivity-mixed attacks in the cyber layer, and concurrent output channel noises, sensor/actuator faults, and wave-induced disturbances in the physical layer. Sensor/actuator faults are initially modeled with unified incipient and abrupt features. Additionally, connectivity-mixed attacks are depicted using connectivity-paralyzed and connectivity-maintained topologies through nonoverlapping and switching iterations. The standardization and observer design in multi-USVs are incorporated to decouple the augmented dynamics and estimate unknown state, fault, and noise observations, and then a defense and fault-tolerant consensus tracking control approach is designed to accomplish the robustness to disturbances/noises, resilience to attacks, and tolerance to faults, simultaneously. The criteria for achieving leader-following exponential consensus tracking of multi-USVs with cyber-physical threats can be determined based on activation rate and attack frequency indicators. Comparative simulations outline the effectiveness and economy of the proposed defense and tolerance technique against sensor/actuator faults and cyber-attacks on multi-USVs.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=10323249,IEEE Transactions on Intelligent Transportation Systems,2024-01-01
Human-Vehicle Shared Steering Control for Obstacle Avoidance: A Reference-Free Approach With Reinforcement Learning,"Although artificial intelligence has made tremendous progress recently, there remain various technical issues and ethical problems before autonomous vehicles can be available to the general public. In the interim, collaboration between automated systems and human drivers becomes a promising solution, where the merits of machine intelligence and human intelligence are blended in a complementary way. To this end, the paper proposes a reference-free human-vehicle shared control framework based on reinforcement learning. Firstly, a personalized human-like driver agent is derived from highway driving data by means of generative adversarial imitation learning integrated with Gaussian mixture model. The driver model is responsible for real-time interaction with the reinforcement learning agent to relieve the burden of human operators in the course of training. Then, a copilot agent learns the policies to cooperatively control the vehicle steering based on three distinct implementations for the search of the best coordination strategy. Heuristic reward functions are designed to guide the agent policy optimization for multi-objective equilibrium between driver synchronization against intervention. To verify the control performance of the proposed shared driving system, simulation experiments with driver models and human-in-the-loop tests with real-life participants are conducted in the end of this paper. The results demonstrate that the shared steering control method can effectively follow human intentions, facilitate driving goals, improve road safety and reduce driverâs workload simultaneously in the challenging dynamic obstacle avoidance scenarios.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85209104102&origin=inward,IEEE Transactions on Intelligent Transportation Systems,2024-01-01

Hybrid Trajectory Planning for Connected and Autonomous Vehicle Considering Communication Spoofing Attacks,"In this study, we introduce a novel hybrid trajectory planning algorithm for autonomous driving, specifically designed to mitigate the risks posed by spoofing attacks on Connected and Autonomous Vehicles (CAVs). The research begins by assessing the safety implications of attacks and developing an adaptive safety model that is grounded in the fundamental assessment of state and decision data. This model incorporates the establishment of a posterior probability distribution for decision data, rooted in the pre-existing prior distribution but adjusted to account for the influence of spoofing attacks. The adjustment is achieved through Bayesian maximum posterior estimation, thereby refining the model to better adapt to potential threats. The adaptive safety model is then optimized dynamically, taking into consideration a set of indicesâsafety, comfort, and efficiencyâthat are critical to trajectory planning. In the subsequent phase, we introduce a composite trajectory planning algorithm that integrates a lateral trajectory selection sampling method with a longitudinal trajectory optimization approach. The adaptive safety model is seamlessly integrated into the trajectory planning process, influencing target position selection, the setting of constraints, and the formulation of the optimization objective function. The results demonstrate that the algorithm effectively limits the average standard deviation of lateral displacement to 0.5851 and achieves a significant increase in longitudinal speed growth rate, by up to 7.30%, surpassing the performance of benchmark algorithms. The proposed solution consistently delivers optimal safety and efficiency across various scenarios and under different parameter conditions.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=10474308,IEEE Transactions on Intelligent Transportation Systems,2024-01-01
RPAU: Fooling the Eyes of UAVs via Physical Adversarial Patches,"Recently, Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) deployed with deep learning models have been widely applied both in civil and military. However, the vulnerability of the deployed model to adversarial attacks has raised security concerns. Previous studies have mainly explored adversarial attacks in the digital domain. While physical attacks have posed a more serious threat to UAVs. In this paper, we have explored a novel Robust Physical Attack against UAVs named RPAU, which directly threatens the flight safety of UAVs. Specifically, three attacks are proposed in RPAU: Hiding Attack (HA), Yaw Attack (YA), and Obstacle Attack (OA). To launch the attacks, we overcome three domain-design challenges, including continuous perturbation, digital-physical domain gap, and optimum perturbation generation. For continuous perturbation, we have introduced a nested patch that realizes attacks at any distance. Further, a series of transformations are considered to narrow the gap between the digital and physical domains. Then, we proposed a time-dependent mechanism for generating optimum perturbation. We conducted comprehensive experiments in the digital domain, simulation environment, and physical domain. The experimental results validate the robustness of the proposed framework. In the digital domain, RPAU outperforms the baseline by 54.9% average attack success rate (ASR). More importantly, RPAU is still effective in both the simulation environment and the physical domain, achieving an average ASR of 100%.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=10265297,IEEE Transactions on Intelligent Transportation Systems,2024-01-01
Explosive Cyber Security Threats During COVID-19 Pandemic and a Novel Tree-Based Broad Learning System to Overcome,"The rapid spread of the COVID-19 has not only affected personal health and economy, but also revolutionized peopleâs lifestyles. As more people turn to work and socialize online, the development of unmanned technologies based on the Internet of Vehicles (IoV), such as unmanned delivery, unmanned vehicles, unmanned transportation, etc., will become an inevitable trend. However, all kinds of intelligent terminals for unmanned equipment require a large amount of data interaction with devices such as cloud servers, mobile terminals, and roadside terminals, which poses cyber security risks. Furthermore, the outbreak of COVID-19 has prompted people to put forward higher demands for the security of network communications. Unfortunately, the current intrusion detection methods based on machine learning still have weaknesses such as low accuracy and low efficiency when faced with unbalanced data distribution. To solve the above problems, we propose a novel Tree-based BLS (TBLS) intrusion detection method according to the idea of ensemble learning and decision tree (CART and J48). The performance of TBLS was tested on the NSL-KDD dataset and the UNSW-NB15 dataset respectively, which contain a variety of malicious traffic types for attacks on the IoV. The results show that our proposed method can achieve higher accuracy rate and lower false alarm rate, compared with the existing 16 solutions.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9743968,IEEE Transactions on Intelligent Transportation Systems,2024-01-01
Fuzzy Finite-Time ${H_\infty }$ Hybrid-Triggered Dynamic Positioning Control of Nonlinear Unmanned Marine Vehicles Under Cyber-Attacks,"This article studies the fuzzy finite-time ${H_\infty }$ hybrid-triggered dynamic positioning (DP) control design issue of the nonlinear unmanned marine vehicles against cyber-attacks and ocean disturbances. The motion dynamics are firstly represented by the Takagi-Sugeno (T-S) fuzzy DP models. Secondly, for the purpose of obtaining the surge position, sway position, yaw angle and velocity of unmanned marine vehicles, a fuzzy state observer is proposed to estimate them. Then, a hybrid-triggered mechanism described by a Bernoulli variable is designed to save the communication resources. To overcome the impacts of cyber-attacks and ocean disturbances, a fuzzy ${H_\infty }$ hybrid-triggered DP output feedback controller based on finite-time theory is developed. The stability criterions of the considered systems are formulated through establishing finite-time Lyapunov-Krasovskii functional.

USAF-IoD: Ultralightweight and Secure Authenticated Key Agreement Framework for Internet of Drones Environment,"The use of Internet of Drones (IoD) technology has surged across various domains such as logistics, surveying, industrial inspections, emergency response, security, infrastructure monitoring, crop management, and more. However, real-time communication with drones or Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) in the IoD environment occurs over an insecure open channel, making it susceptible to various security and privacy vulnerabilities, including unauthorized access, data interception, denial of service attacks, and privacy concerns. Due to their unique characteristics, including long transmission distances, unstable communication environments, resource limitations, and the highly dynamic nature of UAVs, ensuring the security and privacy of IoD systems is of paramount importance for the success of IoD-based applications. Furthermore, drones are resource-constrained devices, and employing expensive security solutions is impractical, as it would significantly reduce the operational capacity of drones. In this paper, we present the design of an ultralightweight, secure, and robust user-authenticated key agreement framework for the IoD environment, named USAF-IoD. The proposed USAF-IoD is developed by incorporating authenticated encryption (ASCON), cryptographic hashing, XOR operations, and the use of physical unclonable functions (PUFs). PUFs are employed to enhance resistance against physical tampering attacks. The security analysis reveals that the proposed USAF-IoD meets the essential security requirements of the IoD environment. The comparative analysis further highlights the effectiveness of the proposed USAF-IoD, notably excelling in terms of security and functionality characteristics when compared to existing benchmark schemes, and showcasing competitive performance in computation, communication, and energy overheads.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=10465668,IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology,2024-01-01
Human-Assisted Resilient Coordination for Automated Platoon With False Data Injection Attack,"This paper investigates the resilient platooning problem of connected and automated vehicles (CAVs) under false-data injection (FDI) attacks. These attacks can alter the system state of any vehicle within a platoon at any time, presenting a significant challenge. To tackle this, we introduce a human-assisted resilient coordination (HARC) approach for CAVs, comprised of three core modules: a joint attack detection mechanism, a human-assisted coordination scheme, and a distributed optimization-based control module. The attack detection approach monitors vehicles at two distinct levels - local communication and global communication. Our human-assisted coordination strategy is designed not only to respond efficiently to attacks but also to ensure seamless coordination of the vehicle platoon, thereby preventing accidents and enhancing flexibility. By incorporating human input, we bolster the resilience and security of platoon coordination. Moreover, we present a distributed optimization-based control technique tailored specifically for constrained CAVs. A resilience constraint is designed and incorporated into the optimization problem, thereby empowering CAVs to identify adversarial communication channels via a localized communication detector. We provide experimental results to showcase the effectiveness of our proposed approach and to highlight its implications for resilient platooning under FDI attacks.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=10648953,IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology,2024-01-01
Transforming Transportation: Safe and Secure Vehicular Communication and Anomaly Detection With Intelligent CyberâPhysical System and Deep Learning,"Intelligent Cyber-Physical Transportation Systems (ICTS) rely deeply on data exchange between moving vehicles and fixed infrastructure. While exchanging data between vehicles in the network, security is a main constraint. ICTS encompasses many facilities and claims, such as managing road traffic, traveler data, public transportation systems, and autonomous vehicles. It is anticipated that ICTS will make significant contributions to future smart cities and urban design in road and traffic security, transportation and transport optimization, energy efficiency, and environmental pollution control. Flexibility, variety of quality-of-service needs, and massive volumes of data generated all present challenges when working with ITS. Previous works on cyber-physical attack detection lag in ensuring security at various levels. To monitor In-Vehicle Networks (IVN), Vehicle-to-Vehicle (V2V) Communications, and Vehicle-to-Infrastructure (V2I) Networks for malicious behavior, we introduce a deep learning-based Intrusion Detection System (IDS) for ICTS. In this research, we look into how Deep Learning (DL), a relatively new but rapidly growing subject, could help improve ICTS. This research investigates whether deep learning can enhance the security of autonomous vehicles and other forms of smart transportation. We improve the smart transport network using the deep learning method, simulate it, and statistically study its data transmission economy, accuracy projections of the future, and path-switching strategy. To identify malicious activity in the core networks of autonomous vehicles (AV), we have developed an ensemble Long-Short Term Memory (LSTM) technique based on Deep Learning architecture. The car hacking dataset (used to monitor communications within a vehicle) and the UNSWNB15 dataset (used to monitor communications with the outside world) are used to test and compare the performance of the proposed IDS. The experimental findings showed that our suggested system outperformed other intrusion detection methods by achieving 100% accuracy in detecting all sorts of assaults on the auto-hacking dataset and 99% on the UNSW-NB15 dataset.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=10308696,IEEE Transactions on Consumer Electronics,2024-01-01
A Neural Computing-Based Access Control Protocol for AI-Driven Intelligent Flying Vehicles in Industry 5.0-Assisted Consumer Electronics,"The continuous revolution in Artificial Intelligence (AI) has played a significant role in the development of key consumer applications, including Industry 5.0, autonomous decision-making, fault diagnosis, etc. In practice, autonomous and intelligent robots and flying vehicles (i.e., drones) are also becoming the integral part of Industry 5.0. These vehicles are attaining significant importance nowadays because of their applications in consumer electronics. However, there may be numerous privacy issues in such an infrastructure. Nevertheless, neural computing-driven security solutions have played a significant role in overcoming the security and privacy issues of AI-driven intelligent flying vehicles. Motivated by these facts, this article presents a neural computing-based access control protocol for AI-driven flying vehicles to prevent all possible security threats. A detailed security evaluation of the devised protocol is done formally using the extensively recognized Real-Or-Random (ROR) oracle model. Similarly, the informal security analysis ensures the resistance of our scheme against various potential attacks under the assumptions of CK and DY adversarial models. Moreover, detailed performance scrutiny of the devised protocol with various existing schemes shows the robustness and supremacy of our scheme in terms of computation, communication overhead, and security attributes.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=10129927,IEEE Transactions on Consumer Electronics,2024-01-01
ODFa${}^{2}$: Overall Defense Framework Against Cyber-Attacks on Intelligent Connected Vehicles,"Autonomous driving, as an emerging technology, is developing rapidly. However, a number of obstacles appear to be holding back the widespread adoption of autonomous driving. Cybersecurity issues, which have a significant impact both technically and psychologically on people's willingness to use autonomous driving, are one of the most significant barriers. Attackers have adopted increasingly diverse threat methods, increasing cyber-attacks. Despite these threats, global standards have been developed for road vehicle safety and cybersecurity. These standards are intended to guide manufacturers of automotive systems. For instance, the ISO and SAE have jointly released the international standard ISO/SAE 21434 (Road VehiclesâCybersecurity Engineering) for road vehicle cybersecurity. However, focusing on the development of onboard systems alone when examining the application of these standards is not sufficient. Currently, we lack a methodology to directly apply the ISO/SAE 21434 standard to automotive system engineering projects. In particular, the overall framework of cybersecurity design for intelligent connected vehicle systems needs to be developed. This paper proposes an overall cybersecurity assurance framework (ODFa${}^{2}$) based on the ISO/SAE 21434 standard to assist system engineers in understanding security risks, evaluating the feasibility of attack implementation, and determining the trade-off methods for security countermeasures. We illustrate through a case study how this model-based framework may be applied to cybersecurity engineering in intelligent connected vehicles and mobility service platforms. Furthermore, the results of comparative experiments indicate that the proposed strategy optimization algorithm outperforms existing algorithms in terms of time efficiency under certain conditions.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=10366872,IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology,2024-01-01
Adversarial Computer Vision via Acoustic Manipulation of Camera Sensors,"Autonomous vehicles increasingly rely on camera-based computer vision systems to perceive environments and make critical driving decisions. To improve image quality, image stabilizers with inertial sensors are added to reduce image blurring caused by camera jitters. However, this trend creates a new attack surface. This paper identifies a system-level vulnerability resulting from the combination of emerging image stabilizer hardware susceptible to acoustic manipulation and computer vision algorithms subject to adversarial examples. By emitting deliberately designed acoustic signals, an adversary can control the output of an inertial sensor, which triggers unnecessary motion compensation and results in a blurred image, even when the camera is stable. These blurred images can induce object misclassification, affecting safety-critical decision-making. We model the feasibility of such acoustic manipulation and design an attack framework that can accomplish three types of attacks: hiding, creating, and altering objects. Evaluation results demonstrate the effectiveness of our attacks against five object detectors (YOLO V3/V4/V5, Faster R-CNN, and Apollo) and two lane detectors (UFLD and LaneAF). We further introduce the concept of AMpLe attacks, a new class of system-level security vulnerabilities resulting from a combination of adversarial machine learning and physics-based injection of information-carrying signals into hardware.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=10330036,IEEE Transactions on Dependable and Secure Computing,2024-01-01
Velocity Consistency Checking Based GNSS Spoofing Detection Method for Vehicles,"Autonomous driving, unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), and various other vehicular navigation schemes heavily depend on the accurate position, velocity, and timing (PVT) information offered by global navigation satellite systems (GNSSs). Meanwhile, GNSS security is challenged by spoofing attacks that aim to deceive users by inducing false PVT solutions. Therefore, detecting these attacks on time is vital for vehicular navigation security. Spoofing attacks involve transmitting counterfeit signals from spoofers instead of authentic satellites, making it difficult to coordinate spatial information accurately. To this end, the Doppler shift, revealing spatial features between transmitters and receivers, is regarded as an effective metric for spoofing detection. Especially for vehicles, due to their motion relative to the spoofer, Doppler bias is appended to the raw measurement, providing an observable spoofing signature. Conventional approaches tend to directly monitor the Doppler bias but require complex requirements like static initialization, random motion, and multiple receivers. Moreover, the commonly utilized single-antenna assumption renders them ineffective against multi-antenna spoofing attacks. This paper proposes a new approach that indirectly exploits the Doppler bias by examining its adverse impact on velocity consistency. The introduced direct velocity determination (DVD) method calculates velocity directly from the Doppler measurements, which is then utilized for consistency-checking alongside the velocity obtained from the conventional pseudorange-aided approach. We thoroughly investigate the impact of Doppler bias on velocities and analyze their consistency across different scenarios. Field tests validate the effectiveness of the proposed method, surpassing previous Doppler-based methods and the widely used receiver autonomous integrity monitoring (RAIM) method.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=10269041,IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology,2024-01-01
Neural-Network-Based Adaptive Fault-Tolerant Cooperative Control of Heterogeneous Multiagent Systems With Multiple Faults and DoS Attacks,"In this article, the issue of adaptive fault-tolerant cooperative control is addressed for heterogeneous multiple unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) and unmanned ground vehicles (UGVs) with actuator faults and sensor faults under denial-of-service (DoS) attacks. First, a unified control model with actuator faults and sensor faults is developed based on the dynamic models of the UAVs and UGVs. To handle the difficulty introduced by the nonlinear term, a neural-network-based switching-type observer is established to obtain the unmeasured state variables when DoS attacks are active. Then, the fault-tolerant cooperative control scheme is presented by utilizing an adaptive backstepping control algorithm under DoS attacks. According to Lyapunov stability theory and improved average dwell time method by integrating the duration and frequency characteristics of DoS attacks, the stability of the closed-loop system is proved. In addition, all vehicles can track their individual references, while the synchronized tracking errors among vehicles are uniformly ultimately bounded. Finally, simulation studies are given to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=10154461,IEEE Transactions on Neural Networks and Learning Systems,2024-01-01

Network-Based Modeling and Sampling Guaranteed Cost Control for Unmanned Surface Vehicle Systems Under Stochastic Cyber-Attacks,"The future extensive usage of continuous measurable communication network for output feedback control in unmanned surface vehicle (USV) will inevitably increase the control cost, waste energy, and even reduce the system performance under stochastic cyber attacks. However, the existing study largely ignores the guaranteed cost control of USV under stochastic cyber attacks. To fill the knowledge gap, this paper attempts to focus on the guarantee cost control of USV systems by taking into account the finite measurable output sampling information and stochastic cyber attacks. Initially, a point output sampling control strategy based on finite measurable output sampling information is proposed, which has a strong application background and important theoretical research value in the field of power grid security. On this basis, a new stochastic composite system containing both system state and output sampling information is developed. Subsequently, a sampling-time-dependent Lyapunov function (LYFU) is exploited to ensure the workable criteria of the cost sampling controller, which can not only stabilize the stochastic composite system by means of the mean square exponential stability, but also reveal the upper bound (UPBO) of the quadratic cost function (COFU). Specially, in the strict sensu of minimizing the UPBO of the COFU, a meaningful design method for a suboptimal guaranteed cost output sampling controller is designed, which is a modulus-related LMI optimization algorithm. Finally, numerical simulation results of USV and additional vehicle lateral motion model are developed to demonstrate the validity and rationality of the proposed design method.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=10400972,IEEE Transactions on Intelligent Transportation Systems,2024-01-01
Resilient Cruise Control of Heterogeneous Platoons Against Byzantine Attacks: Theory and Experiment,"This article studies the problem of the resilient cruise control in heterogeneous vehicle platoons against f-local Byzantine attacks (BAs). Agents under BAs become traitors of the swarm, who try to mislead its neighbors while adopting wrong inputs. Thus, BAs are extremely challenging to be suppressed. This study introduces a novel hierarchical protocol characterized by a virtual twin layer (TL), motivated by the rationale of digital twin. This protocol separates the defense scheme against f-local BAs into two parts: one defense scheme against Byzantine edge attacks (BEAs) via the TL and another scheme against Byzantine node attacks (BNAs) via the cyber-physical layer (CPL). The TL employs a trusted-edge strategy, enhancing the network resilience by incorporating a minimal fraction of the key edges. It is rigorously proven that a TL topology meeting strong  $(2f+1)$ -robustness is sufficient for achieving distributed resilient estimation against BEAs. On the CPL, a series of decentralized chattering-free controllers is proposed, guaranteeing the resilient cruise tracking of heterogeneous platoons against exponentially unbounded BNAs. Besides, these controllers can achieve uniformly ultimately bounded convergence. The theoretical resultsâ effectiveness and practicality are validated through a numerical simulation example and an unmanned ground vehicle experiment involving heterogeneous platoons against f-local BAs.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85210540814&origin=inward,IEEE Transactions on Cybernetics,2024-01-01
Lâ-Gain-Based Path Following Control for Autonomous Vehicles Under Time-Constrained DoS Attacks,"Autonomous vehicles (AVs) are being enhanced by introducing wireless communication to improve their intelligence, reliability and efficiency. Despite all of these distinct advantages, the open wireless communication links and connectivity make the AVsâ vulnerability to cyber-attacks. This paper proposes an  $L_{2}$ -gain-based resilient path following control strategy for AVs under time-constrained denial-of-service (DoS) attacks and external interference. A switching-like path following control model of AVs is first built in the presence of DoS attacks, which is characterized by the lower and upper bounds of the sleeping period and active period of the DoS attacker. Then, the exponential stability and  $L_{2}$ -gain performance of the resulting switched system are analyzed by using a time-varying Lyapunov function method. On the basis of the obtained analysis results,  $L_{2}$ -gain-based resilient controllers are designed to achieve an acceptable path-following performance despite the presence of such DoS attacks. Finally, the effectiveness of the proposed  $L_{2}$ -gain-based resilient path following control method is confirmed by the simulation results obtained for the considered AVs model with different DoS attack parameters.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85203104339&origin=inward,IEEE Transactions on Intelligent Transportation Systems,2024-01-01
Security Analysis for Autonomous Ground Vehicle Under Stealthy Sensor Attacks,"Lateral stability is a remarkably critical metric for the autonomous ground vehicle (AGV), and its loss is probable to cause a fatal accident. Various vehicular sensors, which play a key role in the lateral stability system, are coordinated to monitor the AGV's driving states. However, sensor attacks will inevitably push the AGV's lateral stability system into a insecure situation. In this paper, therefore, we investigate the security and insecurity conditions of the AGV under sensor attacks. Firstly, the dynamics output control protocol and the anomaly detector are developed in the lateral stability system. Then, we analyze the stealthiness of sensor attacks from the given detector's viewpoint. To describe how much the AGV is influenced by sensor attacks, we propose an equivalence condition associated with state variations. Besides, it is shown that internal states of the dynamics lateral controller are immune to stealthy sensor attacks. Secondly, we give a necessary and sufficient condition about the insecurity of AGV, which also motivates us how to design parameters to ensure cyber-security. Finally, we give a simulation to demonstrate the feasibility of the presented methodology. Specifically, we design a self-generated stealthy attack sequence, in which this sequence does not involve utilizing the system data in real-time.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=10502302,IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology,2024-01-01

Action Robust Reinforcement Learning for Air Mobility Deconfliction Against Conflict Induced Spoofing,"Increased dynamic drone usage has increased complexity in aerial navigation and often demands distributed local deconfliction. Due to the high velocities and few landmarks, robust deconfliction relies on precise positioning and synchronization. However, intentional spoofing attacks aimed at inducing navigation conflicts threaten the reliability of conventional techniques. Here, we address these concerns by establishing a baseline on the impact of novel conflict-inducing spoofing attacks on existing geometric navigation methods. Based on the impact of the attacks on the navigation, reinforcement learning (RL) strategy is used to counter the effects of spoofing attacks. In order to counter the effect of spoofing in randomized dynamic airspace conditions, a zero-sum action-robust (ZSAR) RL based on mixed Nash equilibrium objective is used. The proposed methodology yields an improved number of conflict-free paths while reducing average conflicts compared to existing state of the art RL strategies, thus making it suitable for deploying autonomous aircrafts.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=10682497,IEEE Transactions on Intelligent Transportation Systems,2024-01-01
Dynamic Event-Triggered Model Predictive Control Under Channel Fading and Denial-of-Service Attacks,"This article presents a model predictive control (MPC) design based on dynamic event-triggered mechanism (DETM). In the sensor-to-controller channel, the networks are unreliable in the sense that the transmitted signals may suffer from channel fading which is characterized by a stochastic process. In the controller-to-actuator network, the Denial-of-Service (DoS) attacks are taken into consideration whose dynamic behavior is described by a binary Markov process. Moreover, the external disturbance is considered. First, a DETM is employed to schedule the data transmission with the aim of reducing the communication burden. Then, an  $H_{\infty }$ -type cost function is applied in the MPC design to improve the systemâs robustness against disturbance. Different from the conventional MPC, the novelty of developed MPC is that it can improve the communication efficiency and enhance the robustness against these network-induced issues simultaneously. At last, the validity and superiority of the proposed technique are demonstrated by simulation studies. Note to PractitionersâWith the development of information technologies, the practical control systems are highly integrated with wireless networks. In such case, the network-induced issues are very important. For example, in the platooning control of automated vehicles, the conventional time-triggered control scheme leads to unnecessary waste of communication resource and thus heavy communication burden. Especially, this issue becomes particularly important when the number of vehicles increases. This article was motivated by this and it suggests a new control design based on DETM. Moreover, in control systems, it is necessary to utilize the state measurement to compute control signals. However, when the measured state information is affected by DoS attacks and channel fading, the system performance and even stability will be seriously damaged. Furthermore, the external disturbances widely exist in practical engineering. Considering the influence of these issues, this paper studies the design of MPC. The obtained results aim to provide a helpful reference for the controller design under various network-induced issues, involving bandwidth constraints, DoS attacks and channel fading. It is expected that the proposed MPC design can be applied to more practical engineering systems.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85176334731&origin=inward,IEEE Transactions on Automation Science and Engineering,2024-01-01
Beidou Receiver Based on Anti-Jamming Antenna Arrays with Self-Calibration for Precise Relative Positioning,"Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) may be subjected to unintentional radio frequency interference (RFI) or hostile jamming attack which will lead to fail to track global navigation satellite system (GNSS) signals. Therefore, the simultaneous realization of anti-jamming and high-precision carrier phase difference positioning becomes a dilemmatic problem. In this paper, a distortionless phase digital beamforming (DBF) algorithm with self-calibration antenna arrays is proposed, which enables to obtain distortionless carrier phase while suppressing jamming. Additionally, architecture of high precision Beidou receiver based on anti-jamming antenna arrays is proposed. Finally, the performance of the algorithm is evaluated, including antenna calibration accuracy, carrier phase distortionless accuracy, and carrier phase measurement accuracy without jamming. Meanwhile, the maximal jamming to signal ratio (JSR) and real time kinematic (RTK) positioning accuracy under wideband jamming are also investigated. The experimental results based on the real-life Beidou signals show that the proposed method has an excellent performance for precise relative positioning under jamming when compared with other anti-jamming methods.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=10530539,Journal of Systems Engineering and Electronics,2024-01-01
Intelligent Finite-Time Protocol-Based Stabilization for Networked UMV Systems With DoS Attacks,"This study concentrates on the finite-time protocol-based stabilization for networked unmanned marine vehicle (UMV) systems with denial-of-service (DoS) attacks. To save limited communication resources, a novel event-driven protocol is proposed, in which Q-learning mechanism is adopted to adjust the threshold of the driven condition intelligently. In light of aperiodic DoS attacks, the corresponding switched system is constructed in light of the average dwell time strategy. Employing switching Lyapunov functional, sufficient conditions are made for finite-time boundedness of the UMV systems with disturbance, respectively, in which the relationship among the DoS parameter, the triggered parameter, the finite-time parameter, and the sampling period is accurately characterized. Moreover, the co-design approach of driven parameter and controller gain is proposed for the corresponding UMV systems. Finally, the benchmark UMV systems are shown to verify the effectiveness of the proposed strategy.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85208691185&origin=inward,IEEE Transactions on Intelligent Transportation Systems,2024-01-01
Detection of Shockable Arrhythmia From Electrocardiogram Signal Using Recurrence Quantification Analysis Based Deep Convolutional Neural Networks,"Ventricular fibrillation and ventricular tachycardia are shockable cardiac symptoms. These ventricular arrhythmias (VAs) raise the risk of heart failure by causing heart attacks and other heart problems. The electrocardiogram (ECG) is a commonly used and trustworthy technique for identifying cardiac arrhythmia. In case of emergency patient conditions, acknowledging the limitations of manual cardiac arrhythmia detection methods underscores the pressing need for an automated system. This work presents an automated system for the classification of shockable arrhythmia (SA) and nonshockable arrhythmia (NSA) through ECG signals. The proposed work uses recurrence quantification analysis (RQA) to transform 1-D ECG signal into 2-D RQA image. The RQA images are classified into shockable and nonshockable classes on the first stage of classification using modified versions of the last layer of the pretrained AlexNet, DenseNet, ResNet, and EfficientNet. The second stage of classification refines the distinction between SAs [ventricular fibrillation (VF) and ventricular tachycardia (VT)] and NSAs (normal rhythms and other disorders). Experimental validation using the Physionet ECG database demonstrates the effectiveness of our proposed approach. Notably, the Modified EfficientNet-B0 architecture achieves an impressive overall test accuracy of 98.92%. This study contributes to the field by not only providing a robust method for SA detection but also reducing system complexity. The proposed approach eliminates the need for manual feature extraction or beat detection, enhancing its practical applicability in real-world scenarios.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=10599319,IEEE Transactions on Instrumentation and Measurement,2024-01-01
Multichain-Assisted Lightweight Security for Code Mutated False Data Injection Attacks in Connected Autonomous Vehicles,"Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITSs) comprise a whole infrastructure of conventional vehicles, Connected Autonomous Vehicles (CAVs), roadside units, and communication equipment. As a result, a variety of smart sensors, cloud, and edge services are used. Due to the Vehicle-to-Everything (V2X) communication involved in these, the infrastructure becomes prone to security attacks. The most common of these is False Data Injection Attack (FDIA), which causes serious consequences upon driving decisions of a CAV. Blockchain is an ascending technology to provide proficient data security solutions; however, its implementation in securing CAV data is restricted due to its parallel reliance on cloud services. Furthermore, a standalone blockchain is prone to transaction verification delay and reduced transaction throughput, which is intolerable in the fast-paced CAV communication. This paper presents a novel framework enabling multichain, an open-source blockchain platform. Components of the proposed framework include multiple blockchains running on CAVs. The hashing algorithm operates on their Basic Safety Messages (BSMs), inputted to it as blockchain transactions. Our findings reveal that this multichain framework eliminates reliance on cloud services by devising a fully decentralized security solution against stealthy FDIAs that jeopardize a CAVâs lane-changing. It provides an economy-building point for the CAV-metaverse by incentivizing the participating CAVs. Further, it manages transactions by employing multiple parallel blockchains for enhanced throughput. CAVs perform these security checks in as low as a few milliseconds compared to the existing centralized and computationally intensive frameworks.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85190749954&origin=inward,IEEE Transactions on Intelligent Transportation Systems,2024-01-01
FRHIDS: Federated Learning Recommender Hybrid Intrusion Detection System Model in Software-Defined Networking for Consumer Devices,"In the past few years, numerous methods of attack against recommendation systems have been developed. Cellphones, smart devices, and self-driving cars are instances of distributed IoT consumer devices that generate massive amounts of data on a daily basis and pose security threats to the cloud server. Due to the higher exchange of data, the challenges in this domain lead to increased security issues. Therefore, intrusion detection systems are important for the security and privacy of IoT consumer devices and hence to the cloud server. Due to the prediction, classification of attacks and recommendation of malware devices, the accuracy of machine learning and deep learning approaches for research in security for IoT consumer devices has gained tremendous popularity. Federated learning (FL), is a privacy-preserving decentralized learning technique that does not transport data but instead trains the model locally before sending the parameters to a cloud server, which helps in ensuring the security of data. However, communication channels can still be attacked by hackers, so blocking malicious data is a major requirement for the cloud server. In this paper, a federated learning recommender hybrid intrusion detection system (FRHIDS) model has been proposed that detects the attacks on the SDN network incoming from the IoT consumer devices and recommends that the safety devices transmit the decrypted data to the federated cloud server. In this model, the preservation of the security and privacy model parameters by utilizing the process of testing and training has been implemented. Simulation shows that the proposed approachâs well-designed recommender system has outperformed state-of-the-art models. The performance of the proposed technique is evaluated based on its computational complexity and validation, which have shown 12% improvement over the already existing techniques.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=10304342,IEEE Transactions on Consumer Electronics,2024-01-01
A Privacy-Preserving-Based Distributed Collaborative Scheme for Connected Autonomous Vehicles at Multi-Lane Signal-Free Intersections,"This paper proposes a privacy-preserving distributed collaboration (PPDC) scheme for connected autonomous vehicles (CAVs) to cross signal-free intersections based on the cloud, while securing the private data of the vehicles. Firstly, this paper converts the cooperation problem into a multi-objective problem that aims to improve the efficiency of traffic and fuel economy. Secondly, to prevent the privacy of the transmitted data of vehicles from being inferred by untrusted cloud servers or external attackers, an affine masking-based privacy strategy is designed. Specifically, the vehicle first uploads the encrypted state data to the cloud with the affine masking method. Then the cloud returns the control input by solving the newly constructed optimization problem, which is different but equivalent to the original problem. Then the vehicle calculates the real control input by the inverse affine masking mechanism. Simulation examples show that the proposed PPDC scheme can guarantee collision avoidance and the privacy protection of transmitted data of CAVs, improve traffic efficiency as well as fuel economy, and avoid extensive computation burden.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=10401008,IEEE Transactions on Intelligent Transportation Systems,2024-01-01
Low-Rank Sparse Generative Adversarial Unsupervised Domain Adaptation for Multitarget Traffic Scene Semantic Segmentation,"Semantic segmentation in diverse real-world traffic scenes is a challenging task for autonomous vehicles to have a reliable understanding of the outside environment. Although deep visual models show a remarkable performance on traffic scene segmentation, they need significant improvements when the source and target scene distributions are different. The weather and illumination differences between source and target datasets result in dramatic distribution shifts that degrade the target segmentation performance. This article develops an unsupervised domain adaptation (UDA) model to address complex domain shift problems where the dataset, weather, and illumination of source and target traffic scenes are different. We devise a sparse adversarial multitarget UDA approach to capture powerful domain-invariant features to segment traffic scenes in different conditions. First, a sparse representation of the source traffic scenes is captured via a new spectral low-rank dictionary learning technique in the latent space of a deep encoderâdecoder segmentation architecture. The feature sparsity provides high generalization capacity for our deep feature extractor that enables us to compute complex visual patterns of source images. Then, the distribution of source sparse features is learned using a generative adversarial framework. Finally, the sparse representations of source and target scenes are aligned via a sparse domain-invariant feature extractor trained by minâmax optimization. The aligned features serve as domain-invariant scene representations that can best describe both source and target scenes; hence providing deep domain adaptation for traffic scene semantic segmentation. Experiments on a real-world dataset indicate the superiority of the proposed model compared to the state-of-the-art methodologies.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=10193868,IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics,2024-01-01
Robust Indoor Positioning of Automated Guided Vehicles in Internet of Things Networks With Deep Convolution Neural Network Considering Adversarial Attacks,"The effectiveness of positioning techniques that utilize the receiver signal strength (RSS) is highly dependent on the instability of the received signal strength indicator (RSSI). Up to now, there is no strategy that effectively lowers the influence of such instability on the accuracy of positioning. Moreover, recent studies showed that indoor positioning techniques are vulnerable to noise in RSSI data and cyber-attacks, which make them more expensive. In this study, a new Internet of Things (IoT) paradigm is proposed for the indoor positioning of automated guided vehicles (AGVs) using a deep convolution neural network (CNN). The proposed method handles signal processing by converting the RSSI signal into an image. In which, the 1-D RSSI signal is converted into 2-D image data in order to generate the new features based on continuous wavelet transform (CWT), and then the proposed deep CNN is implemented for the indoor positioning system. The test results show that the proposed model can outperform other state-of-the-art positioning techniques with small position errors. Furthermore, the robustness of the proposed model is validated against various adversarial attacks. In addition, the proposed method can have a lower impact on RSSI change compared with other methods.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=10415265,IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology,2024-01-01
Resilient Consensus for Discrete-Time Multiagent Systems With a Dynamic Leader and Time Delay: Theory and Experiment,"The ever-present cyber-attacks have posed a significant challenge to consensus of multiagent systems (MASs), due to their capability of compromising agents. These threats underscore the critical need to design control strategies that can endow MASs with resilience. In this article, we address resilient consensus problems for first- and second-order discrete-time MASs, considering the presence of malicious agents, a dynamic leader, and communication delay. First, a resilient controller is designed for first-order MASs, and sufficient conditions are derived based on existing robust graph concepts to achieve consensus with ultimately bounded error. Next, since the derived error bound grows factorially with the system scale, a novel graph structure and a modified controller are proposed to limit the growth to a linear rate. Building upon the obtained results, an estimator-based control framework is introduced to solve resilient consensus problems for second-order MASs. Finally, comparative simulations and practical experiments based on unmanned ground vehicles and unmanned-aerial-vehicles are conducted to validate the effectiveness and practicability of the proposed control methods.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85205000956&origin=inward,IEEE Transactions on Cybernetics,2024-01-01
BeTAIL: Behavior Transformer Adversarial Imitation Learning From Human Racing Gameplay,"Autonomous racing poses a significant challenge for control, requiring planning minimum-time trajectories under uncertain dynamics and controlling vehicles at their handling limits. Current methods requiring hand-designed physical models or reward functions specific to each car or track. In contrast, imitation learning uses only expert demonstrations to learn a control policy. Imitated policies must model complex environment dynamics and human decision-making. Sequence modeling is highly effective in capturing intricate patterns of motion sequences but struggles to adapt to new environments or distribution shifts that are common in real-world robotics tasks. In contrast, Adversarial Imitation Learning (AIL) can mitigate this effect, but struggles with sample inefficiency and handling complex motion patterns. Thus, we propose BeTAIL: Behavior Transformer Adversarial Imitation Learning, which combines a Behavior Transformer (BeT) policy from human demonstrations with online AIL. BeTAIL adds an AIL residual policy to the BeT policy to model the sequential decision-making process of human experts and correct for out-of-distribution states or shifts in environment dynamics. We test BeTAIL on three challenges with expert-level demonstrations of real human gameplay in the high-fidelity racing game Gran Turismo Sport. Our proposed BeTAIL reduces environment interactions and improves racing performance and stability, even when the BeT is pretrained on different tracks than downstream learning.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85196480643&origin=inward,IEEE Robotics and Automation Letters,2024-01-01
A Regret-Informed Evolutionary Approach for Generating Adversarial Scenarios for Black-Box Off-Road Autonomy Systems,"Developing autonomous vehicles (AVs) that operate in diverse and demanding environments is a difficult challenge. Two fundamental tools that can accelerate this process are testing an AV in diverse simulated environments and identifying core system weaknesses. While most efforts focus on improving these tools for on-road AVs, this letter focuses on an analogous set of tools for off-road AVs. A method called Black-Box Adversarially Compounding Regret Through Evolution (BACRE) is proposed for identifying adversarial scenarios using an evolutionary algorithm guided by a novel regret-based metric for general navigation tasks. A black-box approach is often preferable when system complexity can be diverse, like with off-road AVs, and when whole-system testing is required. A custom simulation platform is also provided to assist with the automated testing of AVs in diverse, unstructured environments. Numerical experiments demonstrate that BACRE's evolutionary process gradually increases scenario complexity to degrade vehicle performance (an effective and explainable process that comparable methods cannot achieve). Consequently, BACRE can streamline AV development by finding weaknesses at any development stage.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=10496154,IEEE Robotics and Automation Letters,2024-01-01
Detection and Mitigation of Position Spoofing Attacks on Cooperative UAV Swarm Formations,"Detecting spoofing attacks on the positions of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) within a swarm is challenging. Traditional methods relying solely on individually reported positions and pairwise distance measurements are ineffective in identifying the misbehavior of malicious UAVs. This paper presents a novel systematic structure designed to detect and mitigate spoofing attacks in UAV swarms. We formulate the problem of detecting malicious UAVs as a localization feasibility problem, leveraging the reported positions and distance measurements. To address this problem, we develop a semidefinite relaxation (SDR) approach, which reformulates the non-convex localization problem into a convex and tractable semidefinite program (SDP). Additionally, we propose two innovative algorithms that leverage the proximity of neighboring UAVs to identify malicious UAVs effectively. Simulations demonstrate the superior performance of our proposed approaches compared to existing benchmarks. Our methods exhibit robustness across various swarm networks, showcasing their effectiveness in detecting and mitigating spoofing attacks. Specifically, the detection success rate is improved by up to 65%, 55%, and 51% against distributed, collusion, and mixed attacks, respectively, compared to the benchmarks.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=10352334,IEEE Transactions on Information Forensics and Security,2024-01-01
Deep Attention Recognition for Attack Identification in 5G UAV Scenarios: Novel Architecture and End-to-End Evaluation,"Despite the robust security features inherent in the 5G framework, attackers will still discover ways to disrupt 5G unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) operations and decrease UAV control communication performance in Air-to-Ground (A2G) links. Operating under the assumption that the 5G UAV communications infrastructure will never be entirely secure, we propose Deep Attention Recognition (DAtR) as a solution to identify attacks based on a small deep network embedded in authenticated UAVs. Our proposed solution uses two observable parameters: the Signal to Interference plus Noise Ratio (SINR) and the Received Signal Strength Indicator (RSSI) to recognize attacks under Line-of-Sight (LoS), Non-Line-of-Sight (NLoS), and a probabilistic combination of the two conditions. Several attackers are located in random positions in the tested scenarios, while their power varies between simulations. Moreover, terrestrial users are included in the network to impose additional complexity on attack detection. Additionally to the application and deep network architecture, our work innovates by mixing both observable parameters inside DAtR and adding two new pre-processing and post-processing techniques embedded in the deep network results to improve accuracy. We compare several performance parameters in our proposed Deep Network. For example, the impact of Long Short-Term-Memory (LSTM) and Attention layers in terms of their overall accuracy, the window size effect, and test the accuracy when only partial data is available in the training process. Finally, we benchmark our deep network with six widely used classifiers regarding classification accuracy. The eXtreme Gradient Boosting (XGB) outperforms all other algorithms in the deep network, for instance, the three top scoring algorithms: Random Forest (RF), CatBoost (CAT), and XGB obtain mean accuracy of 83.24 %, 85.60 %, and 86.33% in LoS conditions, respectively. When compared to XGB, our algorithm improves accuracy by more than 4% in the LoS condition (90.80% with Method 2) and by around 3% in the short-distance NLoS condition (83.07% with Method 1).",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85167841335&origin=inward,IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology,2024-01-01
Event-Based Distributed Secure Control of Unmanned Surface Vehicles With DoS Attacks,"This study investigates the distributed secure control problem of multiple unmanned surface vehicles (USVs) in the presence of wave-induced disturbances and unified abrupt and incipient rudder angle faults in physical layer, and aperiodic Denial-of-Service (DoS) attacks in cyber layer. Multi-USVs with rudder angle fault and DoS attack modeling are first established. Then, the decentralized unknown input observer (UIO)-based fault estimation and distributed secure control approach is developed in a co-designed framework for multi-USVs with cyberâphysical threats. Advantages of the proposed secure scheme are: 1) actuator faults, DoS attacks, and event-triggering strategies with varying action instants, durations, and locations are synchronously addressed and 2) the criteria of exponential consensus are derived by virtue of attack frequency and average dwelling time technique without prior knowledge of unknown wave-induced perturbation bounds and elimination of Zeno behavior in an event-based mechanism.

Improving Physical Layer Security for multi-UAV Systems Against Hybrid Wireless Attacks,"Multiple unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) systems are increasingly used in civilian and military applications. However, due to the open and broadcast nature of wireless communications, the control and non-payload communication (CNPC) between UAVs and ground control stations (GCSs) is vulnerable to physical (PHY) and medium access control (MAC) layer wireless attacks, such as eavesdropping, jamming, and spoofing. In this paper, we investigate the secure remote control (RC) issue in multi-UAV systems from a physical layer security (PLS) perspective. We propose a secure RC mechanism based on John Boyd's OODA loop and introduce cooperative jamming (CJ) from UAVs to safeguard control data from GCS. To quantify the uncertainty of wireless attacks from aerial and terrestrial potential attackers, we first introduce the Nakagami-m fading model and a mixed line-of-sight (LoS) / non-line-of-sight (NLoS) probability model to characterize hostile air-to-ground (A2G) channels. We then derive the conditions for successful attacks including passive/active eavesdropping, jamming and spoofing, and formulate the risks of each attack and the overall CJ efficiency based on secrecy outage probability (SOP). To optimize the trade-off between risk costs and CJ power consumption for various situations, we propose three levels of control schemes (centralized, partially centralized, and distributed) applicable at GCS or UAVs, and design three decision-making methods with differing complexities. Through simulations, we evaluate the performance of the proposed mechanism under a general scenario that provides diverse physical conditions, threat levels, and security requirements.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=10329444,IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology,2024-01-01
Distributed Platooning Control of Automated Vehicles Subject to Replay Attacks Based on Proportional Integral Observers,"Secure platooning control plays an important role in enhancing the cooperative driving safety of automated vehicles subject to various security vulnerabilities. This paper focuses on the distributed secure control issue of automated vehicles affected by replay attacks. A proportional-integral-observer (PIO) with predetermined forgetting parameters is first constructed to acquire the dynamical information of vehicles. Then, a time-varying parameter and two positive scalars are employed to describe the temporal behavior of replay attacks. In light of such a scheme and the common properties of Laplace matrices, the closed-loop system with PIO-based controllers is transformed into a switched and time-delayed one. Furthermore, some sufficient conditions are derived to achieve the desired platooning performance by the view of the Lyapunov stability theory. The controller gains are analytically determined by resorting to the solution of certain matrix inequalities only dependent on maximum and minimum eigenvalues of communication topologies. Finally, a simulation example is provided to illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed control strategy.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85141618939&origin=inward,IEEE/CAA Journal of Automatica Sinica,2024-01-01
Post-Quantum Authentication Against Cyber-Physical Attacks in V2X-Based Autonomous Vehicle Platoon,"In this paper, we propose a platoon access authentication system for initial access process in autonomous vehicle platoons (AVPs) in which post-quantum encryption and signal processing techniques are employed to protect against both active and passive cyber-physical attacks. To avoid passive quantum cyber attacks, a quasi-cyclic moderate-density parity-check code is used to encode and decode AVP messages. Moreover, an independent component analysis-based signal separation technique is employed to eliminate the effect of high-power active cyber attacks on AVP messages. To measure the reliability of the system, we derive an analytical expression for the system failure probability, taking into account the influence of both the cyber and physical planes. The simulations show that the proposed system is effective against attacks and can help reduce system failures caused by intentional and unintentional adverse cyber-physical effects. The proposed system offers a potential solution to the challenge of protecting initial access while maintaining ultra-reliable low-latency communications between AVPs and the infrastructure.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=10368128,IEEE Transactions on Intelligent Transportation Systems,2024-01-01
Secured and Cooperative Publish/Subscribe Scheme in Autonomous Vehicular Networks,"In order to save computing power yet enhance safety, there is a strong intention for autonomous vehicles (AVs) in future to drive collaboratively by sharing sensory data and computing results among neighbors. However, the intense collaborative computing and data transmissions among unknown others will inevitably introduce severe security concerns. Aiming at addressing security concerns in future AVs, in this paper, we develop SPAD, a secured framework to forbid free-riders and promote trustworthy data dissemination in collaborative autonomous driving. Specifically, we first introduce a publish/subscribe framework for inter-vehicle data transmissions. To defend against free-riding attacks, we formulate the interactions between publisher AVs and subscriber AVs as a vehicular publish/subscribe game, and incentivize AVs to deliver high-quality data by analyzing the Stackelberg equilibrium of the game. We also design a reputation evaluation mechanism in the game to identify malicious AVs in disseminating fake information. Furthermore, for lack of sufficient knowledge on parameters of the network model and the user cost model in dynamic game scenarios, a reinforcement learning based algorithm with hotbooting is developed to obtain the optimal strategies of subscriber AVs and publisher AVs with free-rider prevention. Extensive simulations are conducted, and the results validate that our SPAD can effectively prevent free-riders and enhance the dependability of disseminated contents, compared with conventional schemes.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=10494725,IEEE Transactions on Intelligent Transportation Systems,2024-01-01
A Secure Self-Certified Broadcast Authentication Protocol for Intelligent Transportation Systems in UAV-Assisted Mobile Edge Computing Environments,"Unmanned Aerial Vehicle(UAV)-assisted mobile edge computing(MEC) ensures continuous MEC services by promptly restoring overloaded or disabled MEC infrastructure. Equipped with sufficient computing resources, UAVs deploy to areas needing MEC, such as task offloading and entertainment services. However, in areas with paralyzed edge nodes, vehicle users are unable to verify the legitimacy of UAVs as they cannot access to the trusted authority(TA). Furthermore, the integrity of UAV-assisted MEC environments can be compromised by malicious attackers, as all network participants rely on wireless communication for their interactions. Many authentication schemes have been proposed for UAV environments. However, these schemes encounter a problem of having to communicate through TA for authentication with vehicle users, which makes them difficult to apply to UAV-assisted MEC environments. Therefore, we propose a new broadcast authentication protocol, which can recover MEC services using MEC-equipped UAVs. The proposed protocol can provide UAVs and vehicle users with high reliability via a self-certified public-key cryptosystem, which can verify the legitimacy of the communication partner without the TA. Moreover, we guarantee the user privacy and preserve sensitive information using biohash technology. We verify the security robustness of the proposed protocol using various simulation tool, informal, and formal analyses. We also estimate the practical deployment of the proposed protocol using âNetwork Simulator-3â. Moreover, we estimate the computation and communication overheads and compare with other existing protocols. The results show that the proposed protocol is feasible and provides users with convenient and seamless intelligent transportation services in UAV-assisted MEC environments.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85207630323&origin=inward,IEEE Transactions on Intelligent Transportation Systems,2024-01-01
Cyberattack Monitoring Architectures for Resilient Operation of Connected and Automated Vehicles,"The deployment of connected and automated vehicles (CAVs) may enhance operations and safety with little human feedback. Automation requires the use of communication and smart devices, thus introducing potential access points for adversaries. This paper develops a prototype real-time monitoring system for a vehicle to infrastructure (V2I) based CAV system that generates cyberattack data for CAV operations under realistic traffic conditions. The monitoring system detects any deviations from the normal operation of CAVs using a long-short term memory (LSTM) neural network proposed by the authors and reverts the system back to a safe state of operation using a set of countermeasures. The proposed algorithm was also compared to convolutional neural network (CNN) and other classical algorithms. The monitoring system detected three different emulated cyberattacks with high accuracy. The LSTM showed the highest accuracy of 98% and outperformed the other algorithms. Further, the performance of the monitoring systems was assessed in terms of the impact on traffic stream stability and safety. The results reveal that a fake basic safety message (BSM) attack on even a single CAV causes the traffic stream to become significantly unstable and increase safety risk without the monitoring system. The monitoring system, however, reverts the system to a safe state of operation and reduces the negative impacts of cyberattacks. The monitoring system improves flow stability by an average of 38% as quantified through acceleration variation and volatility. This is comparable to the base case without attacks. The findings have implications for the design of future resilient systems.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85191353701&origin=inward,IEEE Open Journal of Intelligent Transportation Systems,2024-01-01

Stability and Safety Analysis of Connected and Automated Vehicle Platoon Considering Dynamic Communication Topology,"Connected and automated vehicles (CAVs) can communicate with other CAVs through vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) communication technology which can improve the stability and safety performance of the platoon. However, the V2V communication could be unreliable as some factors such as hardware damage, packet loss, and cyber-attack, may lead to communication delay or failure. Considering that the communication topology of the platoon can vary dynamically due to these factors, it may result in instability and collision risk on the platoon. To mitigate the impact of communication delay or failure, the study introduces a dynamic weights optimization-based CAV following model (DWOC). It adopts the multi-predecessor following (MPF) mode with which vehicles can obtain the dynamic information of three predecessors and the corresponding information weights can be adjusted adaptively. The study formulates the string stability conditions of the model and validates the stability and safety impact on the platoon through a series of numerical experiments. The results indicate that DWOC can effectively improve the stability and safety performance under different communication delays. The findings suggest that the CAV manufacturers should account for the possible changes of the communication topology of the platoon. The proposed DWOC can serve as a reference in designing the CAV controller to ensure stability and improve safety of the platoon in reality under different communication delays.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85194033587&origin=inward,IEEE Transactions on Intelligent Transportation Systems,2024-01-01

VAuth: Robust Lightweight Mutual Authentication Protocol Preserving Userâs Anonymity for VANET With FPGA Implementation,"Many applications that are developed for the Intelligent Transport System to ensure safety, efficiency and comfort, depend on communication among mobile vehicular nodes, road side units, fog servers, and trusted authority. Insecure wireless communication used for these applications is vulnerable to many attacks and it can endanger lives, create traffic congestion, and compromise privacy of the users. A robust authentication and key establishment mechanism can prevent security attacks, and also provide additional security features. In this paper, a novel, smart card-based, robust mutual authentication protocol namely VAuth for VANET is proposed. This scheme enables secure communication among entities while also preserving the anonymity and privacy of the users. To preserve unlinkability, VAuth uses pseudo-names, one-time secrets, and verification tokens. Correctness and security goals of the proposed protocol are proved using the formal method BAN logic and the automated tool Scyther respectively. A comparison of the scheme considering communication cost, computation cost, security functionalities, and storage cost is presented. As a proof of concept, our proposed protocol is demonstrated on FPGA boards which offer hardware acceleration capabilities that can handle high mobility of vehicles involved in VANET.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=10700670,IEEE Transactions on Intelligent Transportation Systems,2024-01-01
Trajectory Inference of Unknown Linear Systems Based on Partial States Measurements,"Proliferation of cheaper autonomous system prototypes has magnified the threat space for attacks across the manufacturing, transport, and smart living sectors. An accurate trajectory inference algorithm is required for monitoring and early detection of autonomous misbehavior and to take relevant countermeasures. This article presents a trajectory inference algorithm based on a acrlong CLOE approach using partial states measurements. The approach is based on a physics informed state parameteterization that combines the main advantages of state estimation and identification algorithms. Noise attenuation and parameter estimates convergence are obtained if the output trajectories fulfill a persistent excitation condition.

Intelligent Event-Triggered Control Supervised by Mini-Batch Machine Learning and Data Compression Mechanism for T-S Fuzzy NCSs Under DoS Attacks,"This article presents a comprehensive solution to mitigate network congestion in T-S fuzzy networked control systems caused by denial-of-service (DoS) attacks and quality-of-service (QoS) queuing mechanisms. We develop a novel data compression mechanism to alleviate network congestion and use a mini-batch descent gradient algorithm to optimize trigger thresholds, thereby reducing bandwidth usage. In addition, we introduce asymmetric LyapunovâKrasovskii functions to decrease the number of decision variables, which improves the reliability and robustness of the control algorithm.

A Blockchain-Based Distributed and Intelligent Clustering-Enabled Authentication Protocol for UAV Swarms,"Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) are operated remotely without the presence of a unified system of identity authentication, and wireless communications in untrusted environments can cause the loss of valuable data carried by UAVs. Traditional UAV authentication mechanisms are centralized approaches, which suffer from a single point of failure problem and may incur high complexity computations. Therefore, it is crucial to establish a distributed authentication mechanism between the ground station controller (GSC) and a UAV. Moreover, in case of UAV swarms, the high mobility of the UAVs affects the stability of UAV communications, which leads to the degradation of the UAV authentication performance. Addressing these challenges, we design a blockchain-based distributed authentication mechanism, known as SwarmAuth, for UAV swarms, where the GSC and UAVs follow a mutual authentication approach using physical unclonable functions (PUFs), and the K-means clustering-based intelligent approach is used to dynamically create location-based clusters. The blockchain helps store UAVsâ authentication information in an immutable storage and the associated smart contracts provide a convenient access control model. The security analysis of SwarmAuth is carried out through both formal and informal proofs considering general attacks. Experimental evaluation shows that SwarmAuth can assure trustworthy communications and improve the network performance.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=10264210,IEEE Transactions on Mobile Computing,2024-01-01

Cyber-Physical Intrusion Detection System for Unmanned Aerial Vehicles,"The increasing reliance on unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) has escalated the associated cyber risks. While machine learning has enabled intrusion detection systems (IDSs), current IDSs do not incorporate cyber-physical UAV features, which limits their detection performance. Additionally, the lack of public UAVâs cyber and physical datasets to develop IDS hinders further research. Therefore, this paper proposes a novel IDS fusing UAV cyber and physical features to improve detection capabilities. First, we developed a testbed that includes UAV, controller, and data collection tools to execute cyber-attacks and gather cyber and physical data under normal and attack conditions. We made this dataset publicly available. The dataset covers a range of cyber-attacks including denial-of-service, replay, evil twin, and false data injection attacks. Then, machine learning-based IDSs fusing cyber and physical features were trained to detect cyber-attacks using support vector machines, feedforward neural networks, recurrent neural networks with long short-term memory cells, and convolutional neural networks. Extensive experiments were conducted on varying complexity and range of attack training data to explore whether (a) fusion of cyber and physical features enhances detection performance compared to cyber or physical features alone, (b) fusion enhances detection when IDS is trained on a single attack type and tested on unseen attacks of varying complexity, (c) fusion enhances performance when the range of attack training data increases and models are tested on unseen attacks. Answering these research questions provides insights into IDS capabilities using cyber, physical, and cyber-physical features under different conditions.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=10368002,IEEE Transactions on Intelligent Transportation Systems,2024-01-01
Stealthy Attack on Remote Control System With Local Controller and Its Countermeasures,"Cyberâphysical systems (CPSs) driven by a local controller and a remote controller have been gaining significant research interest in recent years due to its application scenarios in practice, such as unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs). In this article, we consider the security issue in the remote control system with a local controller under stealthy attacks. Under this framework, one controller is designed locally based on the limited measurements collected by a local sensor, and the other controller is designed remotely and is transmitted to the actuator through a wireless communication channel, which may suffer malicious attacks due to its openness. To defend attacks on remote control signal, the KâL divergence-based detector or  $\chi ^{2}$  detector is often adopted. However, there may be attackers adopting stealthy attacks, which can bypass such detectors. Therefore, we analyze the existence of such attacks, and analytically characterize the worst-estimation performance degradation induced by the remote control signal attack. Further, we construct the optimal attack signal to achieve the upper bound on the estimation performance degradation. In addition, we also give countermeasures against such stealthy attacks. Simulations are provided to illustrate the proposed results.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=10304192,"IEEE Transactions on Systems, Man, and Cybernetics: Systems",2024-01-01
A Secure Object Detection Technique for Intelligent Transportation Systems,"Federated Learning is a decentralized machine learning technique that creates a global model by aggregating local models from multiple edge devices without a need to access the local data. However, due to the distributed nature of federated learning, there is a larger attack surface, making cyber-attack detection and defense challenging. Although prior works developed various defense strategies to address security issues in federated learning settings, most approaches fail to mitigate cyber-attacks due to the diverse characteristics of the attack, edge devices, and data distribution. To address this issue, this paper develops a hybrid privacy-preserving algorithm to safeguard federated learning methods against malicious attacks in Intelligent Transportation Systems, considering object detection as a downstream machine learning task. This algorithm involves the edge devices (e.g., autonomous vehicles) and road side units to collaboratively train their model while maintaining the privacy of their respective data. Furthermore, this hybrid algorithm provides robust security against data poisoning-based model replacement and inference attacks throughout the training phase. We evaluated our model using the CIFAR10 and LISA traffic light dataset, demonstrating its ability to mitigate malicious attacks with minimal impact on the performance of main tasks.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=10630660,IEEE Open Journal of Intelligent Transportation Systems,2024-01-01
In-Vehicle Network Intrusion Detection System Using CAN Frame-Aware Features,"With the advancement of connected and automated vehicles (CAVs), drivers now have access to convenient features such as lane-keeping, cruise control, and more. The electronic control units (ECUs) equipped within vehicles communicate with each other through the controller area network (CAN). However, since the CAN does not possess any security mechanisms, it becomes a target for adversaries to attack. In light of this, a significant amount of research regarding intrusion detection systems (IDSs) has focused on detecting such maliciously injected CAN packets. Nevertheless, most existing machine learning-based IDSs neither calculate the exact time intervals of the CAN packets nor utilize the counter information. Precise timing intervals are a crucial feature for detecting spoofing, fuzzing, and replay attacks, and counter information is also a significant feature that can detect fuzzing and replay attacks. Therefore, in this paper, we propose a methodology for extracting two detection features that are aware of CAN frame characteristics: the interframe space (IFS) between two consecutive CAN packets, and the counter information of a CAN data payload (i.e., data field). Using these features, we introduce decision tree-based IDS. We evaluate the proposed features with popular decision tree-based models such as random forest and extreme gradient boosting (XGBoost). The results show that our proposed IDS can detect maliciously injected CAN packets with an F1 score of 99.54% in binary classification and 97.99% in multi-class classification, which are higher scores than what existing machine/deep learning-based IDSs achieve. Additionally, we measure the detection time of our proposed IDS in both online and offline testing environments.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=10287862,IEEE Transactions on Intelligent Transportation Systems,2024-01-01
Collision-Free Formation Control for Heterogeneous Multiagent Systems Under DoS Attacks,"A safe time-varying formation (TVF) control framework is proposed in this article for heterogeneous multiagent systems under the constraints of denial of service (DoS) attacks, noncooperative dynamic obstacles, and input saturation. The framework integrates both the cyber-layer and physical-layer components to address the challenges posed by these adverse conditions. In the cyber-layer, a distributed resilient observer is provided based on a control Lyapunov function (CLF)-quadratic program (QP). This observer estimates a reference exosystem, effectively decoupling heterogeneous dynamics from unsafe networks and optimizing the system resilience against DoS attacks. At the physical-layer, for the first time, a collision-free TVF controller is presented based on the CLF-exponential control barrier function-QP. The controller guarantees high-order heterogeneous agentsâ operation safety under noncooperative obstacles and input saturation. The effectiveness and advantages of the proposed algorithms are verified through the comparative simulations and experiments conducted on a physical system comprising unmanned aerial vehicles and unmanned ground vehicles.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=10609734,IEEE Transactions on Cybernetics,2024-01-01
A Secure Personalized Federated Learning Algorithm for Autonomous Driving,"Federated learning (FL) is a promising technology for autonomous driving, enabling connected and autonomous vehicles (CAVs) to collaborate in decision-making and environmental perception while preserving privacy. However, traditional FL algorithms face challenges related to imbalanced data distribution, fluctuating channel conditions, and potential security risks associated with malicious attacks on local models. This paper proposes a fair and secure FL algorithm that not only addresses the challenges arising from imbalanced data distribution and fluctuating channel conditions, but defends against malicious attacks. Specifically, we first propose a personalized local training round allocation algorithm to balance energy costs and accelerate model convergence. Next, in order to further guarantee security, we embed an attack module based on Gini impurity. Extensive simulations demonstrate that the proposed algorithm achieves energy fairness, reduces global iteration time, and exhibits resistance against malicious attacks.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=10669186,IEEE Transactions on Intelligent Transportation Systems,2024-01-01
Single-View 3D Object Perception Based on Vessel Generative Adversarial Network for Autonomous Ships,"3D object perception in maritime is a promising means to enhance the ability of the autonomous navigation. However, 3D automatic reconstruction of dynamic targets remains a challenging task in the 3D object perception systems. In this paper, we present an innovative GAN-based deep learning neural network for 3D ship reconstruction. The method is able to reconstruct 3D ship models from single view images or videos using shape prior knowledge and a vessel generative adversarial network (Vessel-GAN), which can effectively extract the ship shape features from the single-view images or videos. Furthermore, a 3D feature network optimization model is proposed for loop optimization of 3D ship shape perception. In order to validate the effectiveness of the proposed method, a high resolution single ship dataset (HSSD) was created, and the performance of the proposed method was evaluated against the existing methods, The experimental results show that the Vessel Segment Network (VSNet) can improve the accuracy of the HSSD dataset by 2.5% in the single ship segmentation tasks. In addition, Vessel-GAN was demonstrated to be able to generate multi-view ship images with an impressive FID value of 5.82. Moreover, our model can improve the accuracy of 3D ship modeling by 8.9% on the ShapeNet dataset.

Cloth-Changing Person Re-Identification With Invariant Feature Parsing for UAVs Applications,"Recently, deep learning-based intelligent vehicle control systems have played an important role in real-time road conditions assessment applications. It relies primarily on unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) for specific target retrieval, especially Cloth-Changing Person Re-identification (CC-ReID) technology, to provide support for road observations and environmental monitoring. Existing CC-ReID methods mainly focus on the invariant features of the front and rear views that are independent of clothing; among them, global color enhancement is a commonly used strategy. However, this method usually reduces the chromatism between the target foreground and background, which can easily lead to the loss of features unrelated to clothing and reduce the model's performance. To solve this problem, this article proposes a data augmentation framework with Local Invariant Feature Transformation and Clothing Adversarial Parsing (LIFTCAP) for CC-ReID. The proposed framework is equipped with a Local Invariant Feature Transition (LIFT) module and a Clothes Adversarial Parsing (CAP) module. The former aims to extract invariant features for the same person with different clothes using the local transition manners. CAP is devoted to finding adversarial associations and parsing contour differences between clothing styles. Subsequently, a feature correlation strategy is alternately implemented between the two modules to complete the optimization procedure. Extensive experiments were conducted on the public CC-ReID datasets (LTCC and PRCC), demonstrating the superiority of our proposed method over the latest methods. Furthermore, our method achieved competitive performance, particularly on a surveillance video dataset (CCVID). In addition, based on the LIFTCAP strategy, the proposed algorithm can achieve a time efficiency as low as O(n) for detecting specific targets when deployed on a UAV server (Feisi X200) for real-time road conditions assessment and monitoring applications.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85190342845&origin=inward,IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology,2024-01-01
DOEPatch: Dynamically Optimized Ensemble Model for Adversarial Patches Generation,"Object detection is a fundamental task in various applications ranging from autonomous driving to intelligent security systems. However, recognition of a person can be hindered when their clothing is decorated with carefully designed graffiti patterns, leading to the failure of object detection. To achieve greater attack potential against unknown black-box models, adversarial patches capable of affecting the outputs of multiple-object detection models are required. While ensemble models have proven effective, current research in the field of object detection typically focuses on the simple fusion of the outputs of all models, with limited attention being given to developing general adversarial patches that can function effectively in the physical world. In this paper, we introduce the concept of energy and treat the adversarial patches generation process as an optimization of the adversarial patches to minimize the total energy of the âpersonâ category. Additionally, by adopting adversarial training, we construct a dynamically optimized ensemble model. During training, the weight parameters of the attacked target models are adjusted to find the balance point at which the generated adversarial patches can effectively attack all target models. We carried out six sets of comparative experiments and tested our algorithm on five mainstream object detection models. The adversarial patches generated by our algorithm can reduce the recognition accuracy of YOLOv2 and YOLOv3 to 13.19% and 29.20%, respectively. In addition, we conducted experiments to test the effectiveness of T-shirts covered with our adversarial patches in the physical world and could achieve that people are not recognized by the object detection model. Finally, leveraging the Grad-CAM tool, we explored the attack mechanism of adversarial patches from an energetic perspective.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=10695140,IEEE Transactions on Information Forensics and Security,2024-01-01
ReMAV: Reward Modeling of Autonomous Vehicles for Finding Likely Failure Events,"Autonomous vehicles are advanced driving systems that revolutionize transportation, but their vulnerability to adversarial attacks poses significant safety risks. Consider a scenario in which a slight perturbation in sensor data causes an autonomous vehicle to fail unexpectedly, potentially leading to accidents. Current testing methods often rely on computationally expensive active learning techniques to identify such vulnerabilities. Rather than actively training complex adversaries by interacting with the environment, there is a need to first intelligently find and reduce the search space to only those states where autonomous vehicles are found to be less confident. In this paper, we propose a black-box testing framework ReMAV that uses offline trajectories first to efficiently identify weaknesses of autonomous vehicles without the need for active interaction. To this end, we introduce a three-step methodology which i) uses offline state action pairs of any autonomous vehicle under test, ii) builds an abstract behavior representation using our designed reward modeling technique to analyze states with uncertain driving decisions, and iii) uses a disturbance model for minimal perturbation attacks where the driving decisions are less confident. Our reward modeling creates a behavior representation that highlights regions of likely uncertain autonomous vehicle behavior, even when performance seems adequate. This enables efficient testing without computationally expensive active adversarial learning. We evaluated ReMAV in a high-fidelity urban driving simulator across various single- and multi-agent scenarios. The results show substantial increases in failure events compared to the standard behavior of autonomous vehicles: 35% in vehicle collisions, 23% in road object collisions, 48% in pedestrian collisions, and 50% in off-road steering events. ReMAV outperforms two baselines and previous testing frameworks in effectiveness, efficiency, and speed of identifying failures. This demonstrates ReMAVâs capability to efficiently expose autonomous vehicle weaknesses using simple perturbation models.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85207005727&origin=inward,IEEE Open Journal of Intelligent Transportation Systems,2024-01-01
Multi-Sensors Space and Time Dimension Based Intrusion Detection System in Automated Vehicles,"Recent developments in intelligence technologies have led to an explosion in the use of connected and automated vehicles (CAVs). Unfortunately, these autonomous vehicles face an increasing risk of vulnerability due to various attacks. Vehicle intrusion detection mechanisms are widely employed to mitigate the threats. Although some works have addressed this issue, few works consider situations that the attack detection may be fooled via simultaneous attacking multiple sensors. In this article, we propose a novel intrusion detection system integrated Space Dimension Model and Time Dimension Model based on sensor data fusion for countering both independent attack and confederate attack in automated vehicles. In Space Dimension Model, the correlations of multivariate in-vehicle sensor data among multiple sensors are utilized as the input of our optimized convolutional neural network (CNN) model. Especially, we construct vehicle state matrices to characterize the underlying correlation of data between each sensor and other sensors, and then input them into our network for classification. To describe the abrupt deviation caused by anomalous multivariate sensor data itself, we design Time Dimension Model to capture the sensor behaviors of vehicle state vectors at adjacent time by utilizing the Mahalanobis distance (MD) metric. Extensive empirical studies based on a real-world vehicular dataset demonstrate the effectiveness of our integrated anomaly detection mechanisms by a comparative analysis with two detection models that consider only Space Dimension and Time Dimension respectively. The method can outperform the related work under different scenarios 1) with the gain of up to 3.01% in accuracy and 3.04% in F1 score; 2) with ability of defending against confederate attack effectively.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=10224320,IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology,2024-01-01
Harnessing Generative Modeling and Autoencoders Against Adversarial Threats in Autonomous Vehicles,"The safety and security of Autonomous Vehicles (AVs) have been an active area of interest and study in recent years. To enable human behavior, Deep Learning (DL) and Machine Learning (ML) models are extensively used to make accurate decisions. However, the DL and ML models are susceptible to various attacks, like adversarial attacks, leading to miscalculated decisions. Existing solutions defend against adversarial attacks proactively or reactively. To improve the defense methodologies, we propose a novel hybrid Defense Strategy for Autonomous Vehicles against Adversarial Attacks (DSAA), incorporating both reactive and proactive measures with adversarial training with Neural Structured Learning (NSL) and a generative denoising autoencoder to remove the adversarial perturbations. In addition, a randomized channel that adds calculated noise to the model parameter is utilized to encounter white-box and black-box attacks.

Adapting Image Classification Adversarial Detection Methods for Traffic Sign Classification in Autonomous Vehicles: A Comparative Study,"Autonomous driving systems critically depend on accurately classifying traffic signs, a task that is jeopardized by adversarial attacks. This paper focuses on the relatively unexplored domain of Traffic Sign Classification (TSC) in the context of detecting adversarial attacks. We conduct a rigorous evaluation of six prominent adversarial example detection methods, each representing a distinct detection category and well-regarded within the research community. Our methodology involves adapting these techniques, originally developed for general image classification (IC), to the unique challenges posed by traffic sign images, characterized by their complexity due to factors like varying environmental conditions and a large number of classes. Our study reveals insights into their effectiveness, with the Natural Scene Statistics (NSS) method outperforming others with 83.42%, 86.42%, and 99.96% detection rates; 0.08%, 0.05%, and 0.04%, false positive rates; and 0.02sec, 0.01sec, and 0.02sec detection times for Chinese, Belgium and German traffic sign datasets, respectively. NSSâs superiority is crucial for autonomous vehicles. Our study also sheds light on the often-neglected aspect of detection time in IC, which plays a vital role in ensuring operational efficiency and safety for autonomous vehicles. Our research highlights the need for customized defense strategies tailored to the TSC domain, considering our evaluationâs findings.

Fully Distributed Secure State Estimation for Nonlinear Multi-Agent Systems Against DoS Attacks: An Edge-Pinning-Based Method,"This paper investigates the fully distributed secure state estimation problem of nonlinear multi-agent systems (MASs) against denial-of-service (DoS) attacks. The design of state observer depends on the relative measurement outputs between neighboring agents rather than the absolute ones of agents themselves. To cooperatively estimate system states with the influence of DoS attacks in a fully distributed scenario, an edge-pinning-based synchronous update strategy for coupling weights is proposed. The purpose of adopting edge pinning method is to adjust partial coupling weights between neighboring agents instead of all ones, which can effectively reduce estimation complexity and save computing resources, especially for large-scale MASs. Further, an edge-pinning-based asynchronous update strategy for coupling weights is designed to meet different actual demands. Then, the security state estimation schemes under synchronous and asynchronous update strategies are proposed without utilizing any global information, such as the Laplacian matrix of communication graph or its smallest nonzero eigenvalue, and so on. Finally, a simulation example is provided to verify the theoretical results. Note to PractitionersâThis paper addresses the distributed secure state estimation problem for nonlinear MASs, which plays an important role in unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) formation, intelligent transport systems, smart grids, and so on. The absolute measurement outputs of agents themselves are usually unavailable in practical situations, so the relative measurement outputs between neighboring agents are used to design observers. Moreover, to overcome the difficulty that global information is unavailable in industrial applications with DoS attacks, the edge-pining-based synchronous and asynchronous update strategies for coupling weights are proposed in a fully distributed scenario.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85165255069&origin=inward,IEEE Transactions on Automation Science and Engineering,2024-01-01
Fuzzy Adaptive Event-Triggered Resilient Formation Control for Nonlinear Multiagent Systems Under DoS Attacks and Input Saturation,"This article studies the fuzzy adaptive event-triggered resilient formation (RF) control problem for nonlinear multiagent systems (MASs) subject to denial-of-service (DoS) attacks and input saturation. Fuzzy logic systems (FLSs) are adopted to identify unknown subsystems, and a fuzzy state estimator is established to address the issue resulted from unmeasurable states. A distributed RF filter is proposed to estimate the unknown leader and obtain the  $n$ -order derivative of the estimated leader under DoS attacks. To save limited communication resource and reduce the number of controller updates, a switching event-triggered mechanism (SETM) is introduced. Then, a fuzzy event-triggered RF control algorithm is designed via backstepping control method. It is demonstrated that the controlled MASs are stable and formation errors converge even subject to DoS attacks and input saturation. Finally, we apply the event-triggered RF control algorithm to unmanned surface vehicles (USVs), the simulation results verify the effectiveness of the proposed event-triggered RF control algorithm.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=10465637,"IEEE Transactions on Systems, Man, and Cybernetics: Systems",2024-01-01
Collaborative Honeypot Defense in UAV Networks: A Learning-Based Game Approach,"The proliferation of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) opens up new opportunities for on-demand service provision anywhere and anytime, but also exposes UAVs to a variety of cyber threats. Low/medium interaction honeypots offer a promising lightweight defense for actively protecting mobile Internet of things, particularly UAV networks. While previous research has primarily focused on honeypot system design and attack pattern recognition, the incentive issue for motivating UAVsâ participation (e.g., sharing trapped attack data in honeypots) to collaboratively resist distributed and sophisticated attacks remains unexplored. This paper proposes a novel game-theoretical collaborative defense approach to address optimal, fair, and feasible incentive design, in the presence of network dynamics and UAVsâ multi-dimensional private information (e.g., valid defense data (VDD) volume, communication delay, and UAV cost). Specifically, we first develop a honeypot game between UAVs and the network operator under both partial and complete information asymmetry scenarios. The optimal VDD-reward contract design problem with partial information asymmetry is then solved using a contract-theoretic approach that ensures budget feasibility, truthfulness, fairness, and computational efficiency. In addition, under complete information asymmetry, we devise a distributed reinforcement learning algorithm to dynamically design optimal contracts for distinct types of UAVs in the time-varying UAV network. Extensive simulations demonstrate that the proposed scheme can motivate UAVâs cooperation in VDD sharing and improve defensive effectiveness, compared with conventional schemes.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85174818083&origin=inward,IEEE Transactions on Information Forensics and Security,2024-01-01

Resilient Prediction-Based and Event-Triggered Control for CPSs Under DoS Attacks,"This article studies the input-to-state stability (ISS) problem of cyberâphysical systems (CPSs) subject to unknown disturbance and malicious denial-of-service (DoS) attacks. A resilient event-triggering mechanism is first proposed to reduce unnecessary network resource consumption. Then, a novel predictive control protocol is put forward to skillfully compensate for lost signals of CPSs during the case of DoS attacks. It is shown that the resulting closed-loop CPSs can achieve ISS under the proposed control update protocol. One of the key advantages of our proposed control protocol is that the missing information can be compensated, and the CPSs thus, can tolerate more unfavorable DoS attacks. Moreover, an intuitive minimum interevent time is provided so as to exclude the Zeno execution of control signals. Finally, a simulation example on unmanned ground vehicle is presented to verify the effectiveness of the proposed control protocols.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85192691203&origin=inward,IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics,2024-01-01
Deep Reinforcement Learning-Based Resource Management for UAV-Assisted Mobile Edge Computing Against Jamming,"In mobile edge computing (MEC) systems, multiple unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) can be utilized as aerial servers to provide computing, communication, and storage services for edge users, called UAV-assisted MEC, which has emerged as a promising technology to improve both the computing and communication performances. Unlike existing works without considering jamming attacks, we investigate a multi-UAV-assisted-MEC scenario under multiple malicious jammers and then propose a resource management approach with the objective of minimizing both the system energy consumption and latency. Due to the time-varying nature of communication environments, we design a multi-agent deep reinforcement learning (MADRL)-based resource management approach to dynamically adjust the CPU frequency, communication bandwidth, and channel access selection of UAVs to enhance the system performance against jamming attacks. On this basis, in order to enhance the algorithm learning efficiency, we propose a multi-agent twin-delayed deep deterministic policy algorithm in combination with the prioritized experience replay mechanism (PER-MATD3) to effectively search for the joint resource management strategy under high-dimensional state and action spaces, where the time-varying channel state information and imperfect attack behavior information are also effectively trained to improve the learning capacity and convergence speed. Simulation and experimental results verify that the proposed approach can significantly decrease the overall system latency (i.e., computing and communication latency) and energy consumption compared to other benchmark algorithms under different real-world settings.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=10614297,IEEE Transactions on Mobile Computing,2024-01-01
RLBA-UAV: A Robust and Lightweight Blockchain-Based Authentication and Key Agreement Scheme for PUF-Enabled UAVs,"Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) integrated with the internet of things (IoT) guarantee useful advantages such as facilitating ground communications in regions where the availability of connectivity is restricted owing to physical obstacles. However, the data transmitted by sensors and IoT embedded in UAVs are facing new security issues and privacy challenges with the known security attacks over time. To address these security attacks and threats and meet lightweight UAV communication requirements, a secure and lightweight authentication and key agreement (AKA) scheme is essential. Recently, researchers have designed a lightweight blockchain-enabled AKA scheme with privacy-preserving for UAVs to provide useful and reliable services. However, we prove that the existing scheme is fragile to various security attacks and does not ensure mutual authentication. Thus, we propose a robust and lightweight blockchain-based AKA scheme for PUF-enabled UAVs, called RLBA-UAV to enhance the security problems of the existing scheme. We demonstrate the security of RLBA-UAV by using informal/formal security analyses such as the ROR oracle model and AVISPA simulation. Moreover, we demonstrate the performance comparison analysis between RLBA-UAV and related schemes for UAVs. We demonstrate an implementation of a network simulator (NS) 3 compliant with IEEE 802.11p standards to show its validation and feasibility that RLBA-UAV is appropriate for practical UAVs. Thus, RLBA-UAV offers enhanced security and operational efficiency compared to related schemes and can be applied to practical blockchain-based AKA systems for UAVs.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=10734851,IEEE Transactions on Intelligent Transportation Systems,2024-01-01
Fuzzy Observer-Based Finite-Time Adaptive Formation Control for Multiple QUAVs With Malicious Attacks,"This article focuses on the finite-time formation control problem for multiple quadrotor unmanned aerial vehicles (QUAVs) with malicious attacks, and presents a finite-time fuzzy adaptive output-feedback control scheme. First, the positional and angular velocities are estimated by developing the fuzzy state observer to replace actual values for controller design. Second, the problem of âcomputational complexityâ is avoided and the effect of filtered error is eliminated by introducing the finite-time command filtered technique and constructing the error compensation mechanism, respectively. Meanwhile, the adaptive parameters are used to estimate the boundaries of malicious attack signals, overcoming the challenge of requiring bounds for attack signals in the backstepping design process. Based on the finite-time stability theory, it is proven that all signals are bounded in the multiple QUAVs system, and the formation tracking errors can converge to a sufficiently small neighborhood near the origin in a finite time. Finally, the validity of the algorithm is verified by a simulation example.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=10654502,IEEE Transactions on Fuzzy Systems,2024-01-01
Dynamic Event-Triggered Fuzzy Adaptive Resilient Consensus Control for Nonlinear MASs Under DoS Attacks,"In this article, the adaptive fuzzy dynamic event-triggered output feedback resilient consensus control issue is investigated for nonlinear multiagent systems (MASs) subject to denial-of-service (DoS) attacks. Fuzzy logic systems (FLSs) are employed to model uncertain agents, and a state observer is constructed to estimate unmeasurable states. An event-triggered distributed resilient observer is designed to save the communication resources between agents, and estimate the unknown leader and its high-order derivatives in case of the communication topology being interrupted by DoS attacks. By the designed state observer and distributed resilient observer, a dynamic event-triggered resilient consensus control method is presented. It is proved that the controlled MASs are stable, and the followers can track the leader under DoS attacks. Moreover, the Zeno behavior can be excluded. Finally, we apply the developed resilient consensus control algorithm to multiple unmanned surface vehicles (USVs), the simulation results verify its effectiveness.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85207047382&origin=inward,"IEEE Transactions on Systems, Man, and Cybernetics: Systems",2024-01-01
Performance Degradation Estimation Mechanisms for Networked Control Systems Under DoS Attacks and its Application to Autonomous Ground Vehicle,"This article examines the mechanisms by which aperiodic denial-of-service (DoS) attacks can exploit vulnerabilities in the TCP/IP transport protocol and its three-way handshake during communication data transmission to hack and cause data loss in networked control systems (NCSs). Such data loss caused by DoS attacks can eventually lead to system performance degradation and impose network resource constraints on the system. Therefore, estimating system performance degradation is of practical importance. By formulating the problem as an ellipsoid-constrained performance error estimation (PEE) problem, we can estimate the system performance degradation caused by DoS attacks. We propose a new LyapunovâKrasovskii function (LKF) using the fractional weight segmentation method (FWSM) to examine the sampling interval and introduce a relaxed, positive definite constraint to optimize the control algorithm. We also propose a relaxed, positive definite constraint that reduces the initial constraints to optimize the control algorithm. Next, we introduce an alternate direction algorithm (ADA) to solve the optimal trigger threshold and design an integral-based event-triggered controller (IETC) to estimate the error performance of NCSs with limited network resources. Finally, we verify the effectiveness and feasibility of the proposed method using the Simulink joint platform autonomous ground vehicle (AGV) model.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=10175196,IEEE Transactions on Cybernetics,2024-01-01
An Anti-Spoofing Model Based on MVM and MCCM for a Loosely-Coupled GNSS/INS /LiDAR Kalman Filter,"GNSS/INS/LiDAR-based Multi-Sensor Fusion (MSF) systems facilitate the efficient integration of multiple navigation sensors to deliver stable and dependable positioning outcomes in Autonomous Vehicles (AVs). Generally, AVs are bound to operate in diverse scenarios. However, state-of-the-art spoofing attack algorithms can identify vulnerable periods of MSF systems and execute aggressive GNSS spoofing in certain specific scenarios with high success rates. The present study proposes a security defense algorithm for MSF systems based on an enhanced Kalman filter, incorporating the Measurement Variance Monitoring (MVM) and Minimum Constraint of Covariance Matrix (MCCM) model. MVM effectively constrains the impact of GNSS signals with large positioning errors, thereby mitigating the adverse effects caused by spoofing attacks. MCCM fully leverages LiDAR information between two consecutive GNSS signals to enhance the credibility of LiDAR measurements, thus improving the positioning correction capability. Furthermore, considering the diverse application environments of AVs, this paper primarily focuses on sensor uncertainty variation and validates different models in varying scenarios. Ultimately, real-world data demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed anti-spoofing model, which can significantly mitigate positioning errors caused by GNSS spoofing attacks without affecting navigation accuracy.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=10325609,IEEE Transactions on Intelligent Vehicles,2024-01-01
Robust Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning Method Based on Adversarial Domain Randomization for Real-World Dual-UAV Cooperation,"A control system of multiple unmanned aerial vehicles (multi-UAV) is generally very complex when they complete a task in a closely-cooperative manner, e.g. two UAVs cooperatively transport a package of goods. Multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) offers a promising solution for such a complex control. However, MARL heavily relies on trial-and-error explorations, facing a big challenge in gathering real-world training data. Simulation environments are commonly used to overcome this challenge, i.e., a control policy is trained in a simulation environment and then transferred into a real-world system. But there often exists a gap between simulation and reality and thus a successful transfer is not guaranteed easily. The domain randomization method provides a workable way to bridge this gap. Nevertheless, the traditional one used in a policy training often suffers from slow convergence and results in an unstable decision policy. To address these issues, this article proposes an adversarial domain randomization method. It utilizes an adversarial generator as a ânature playerâ to generate a more reasonable training environment so that the trained decision policy can deal with complex situations. Additionally, we improve the prioritized experience replay method by which we can sample those critical experiences, increasing the convergence speed of a training without decreasing the performance of the trained policy. We apply our method to a real-world task of dual-UAV cooperative transportation, and experiments illustrate its effectiveness compared to traditional ones.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85168678669&origin=inward,IEEE Transactions on Intelligent Vehicles,2024-01-01
Trust Measurement of Visual Data Based on Multigranularity Belief Fusion for UAV Perception System,"Unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) visual perception plays a pivotal role in the realm of intelligent big data applications such as smart transportation, urban planning, and precision agriculture. Ensuring the integrity and reliability of data collected by UAVs is essential to prevent potential misinformation and tampering in critical data acquisition tasks. However, conventional single assessment and decision-making mechanisms have demonstrated limitations, leaving systems vulnerable to security threats in real-world scenarios. In this study, we propose an innovative trust measurement strategy for UAV visual data based on multigranularity belief fusion (TM-MGBF), aimed at bolstering the reliability of UAV visual data and mitigating the risks posed by malicious attacks. The integration of multigranularity trust (MGT) measurement offers enhanced adaptability and accuracy, offering a promising avenue to address the aforementioned challenges. Specifically, our approach involves devising distinct methodologies for assessing trust across diverse data sources to ascertain their trustworthiness. Furthermore, we introduce an improved fusion strategy, achieving more rational trust measurement by weighting the importance assessment of trust evidence. Experimental results validate the efficacy of the proposed trust model based on multigranularity belief fusion (MGBF), showcasing its superior performance in the evaluation of visual perception data and the fortification of UAV perception systemsâ security posture.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=10683766,IEEE Transactions on Instrumentation and Measurement,2024-01-01
Privacy-Preserving Data-Enabled Predictive Leading Cruise Control in Mixed Traffic,"Data-driven predictive control of connected and automated vehicles (CAVs) has received increasing attention as it can achieve safe and optimal control without relying on explicit dynamical models. However, employing the data-driven strategy involves the collection and sharing of privacy-sensitive vehicle information, which is vulnerable to privacy leakage and might further lead to malicious activities. In this paper, we develop a privacy-preserving data-enabled predictive control scheme for CAVs in a mixed traffic environment, where human-driven vehicles (HDVs) and CAVs coexist. We tackle external eavesdroppers and honest-but-curious central unit eavesdroppers who wiretap the communication channel of the mixed traffic system and intend to infer the CAVsâ state and input information. An affine masking-based privacy protection method is designed to conceal the true state and input signals, and an extended form of the data-enabled predictive leading cruise control under different data matrix structures is derived to achieve privacy-preserving optimal control for CAVs. Numerical simulations demonstrate that the proposed scheme can protect the privacy of CAVs against attackers without affecting control performance or incurring heavy computations.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=10324502,IEEE Transactions on Intelligent Transportation Systems,2024-01-01
AERO: Automotive Ethernet Real-Time Observer for Anomaly Detection in In-Vehicle Networks,"Automotive Ethernet enables high-bandwidth in-vehicle networking, facilitating the transmission of sensor data among electronic control units. However, the increasing connectivity and potential vulnerability inheritance in connected and autonomous vehicles expose them to security risks.

In thisarticle, we propose automotive Ethernet real-time observer (AERO), an unsupervised network IDS designed to protect in-vehicle networks. AERO consists of three components: a feature extractor that constructs three multimodal features, a neural network for processing the extracted features, and an online anomaly detector that calculates outlier scores in real time. We evaluate the performance of AERO using the TOW-IDS automotive Ethernet intrusion dataset. The experimental results demonstrate that AERO achieves high detection performance across five different attack types and is highly applicable to automotive-grade devices for real-time anomaly detection.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=10309857,IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics,2024-01-01
Fooling Decision-Based Black-Box Automotive Vision Perception Systems in Physical World,"Autonomous vehicles use deep neural networks (DNNs) to build powerful vision perception systems, which provide a theoretical foundation for automated vehicle control. Due to the inherent vulnerability of DNNs, many research works have implemented white-box attacks against automotive vision perception systems in the physical world. However, successful black-box attacks (especially decision-based) in the physical world are rarely mentioned because it is difficult to implement a physical-world adversarial attack without internal knowledge about the vision perception systems. In this paper, we propose PRAD, an end-to-end framework that transfers the existing decision-based black-box adversarial attack algorithms (as the backbone of the framework) targeting the digital domain to the physical world for the first time. Specifically,  $T(\cdot)$  is first introduced to simulate the real environment changes, e.g., angle, distance, slight shaking, illumination, etc. Then, and crucially, PRAD bridges the non-differentiable black-box attack and the differentiable  $T(\cdot)$  by the  $L_{1}$  loss function. We use the traffic sign recognition system in the vision perception system as an object to conduct comprehensive experiments, including different environmental conditions, black-box attack backbones, models, and datasets. The results demonstrate that the generated adversarial examples in the decision-based black-box setting can fool the commercial traffic sign recognition system into outputting designated misclassifications with high success rates and strong robustness in the physical world (average 90% in target attacks and nearly 100% in non-target attacks), which outperforms the state-of-the-art homogeneous attack methods.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=10397075,IEEE Transactions on Intelligent Transportation Systems,2024-01-01
Analytical Characterization of Cyberattacks on Adaptive Cruise Control Vehicles,"While automated vehicles (AVs) are expected to revolutionize future transportation systems, emerging AV technologies also open the door for malicious actors to compromise intelligent vehicles. As the first generation of AVs, adaptive cruise control (ACC) vehicles are particularly vulnerable to cyberattacks. Although recent efforts have been made to understand the impact of attacks on transportation systems, little work has been done to systematically model and characterize the malicious nature of these attacks. In this study, we develop a general framework for modeling and synthesizing two types of candidate attacks on ACC vehicles: direct attacks on vehicle control commands and false data injection attacks on sensor measurements, with explicit characterization of their adverse effects. Based on linear stability analysis of car-following dynamics, we derive analytical conditions that characterize the malicious nature of potential attacks. This ensures a higher degree of realism in modeling attacks with adverse effects, as opposed to simply considering constant or random attacks. The conditions derived provide an effective method for synthesizing strategic candidate attacks on ACC vehicles. We conduct extensive simulations to examine the impacts of intelligently designed attacks on microscopic car-following dynamics and macroscopic traffic flow. Numerical results illustrate the attack mechanism, offering useful insights into understanding the vulnerability of future transportation systems. The methodology developed allows for further study of the widespread impact of strategically designed attacks on traffic cybersecurity, inspiring the development of efficient attack detection techniques and advanced vehicle controls.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=10609779,IEEE Transactions on Intelligent Transportation Systems,2024-01-01
CARLA-GeAR: A Dataset Generator for a Systematic Evaluation of Adversarial Robustness of Deep Learning Vision Models,"Adversarial examples represent a serious threat for deep neural networks in several application domains and a huge amount of work has been produced to investigate them and mitigate their effects. Nevertheless, no much work has been devoted to the generation of datasets specifically designed to evaluate the adversarial robustness of neural models. This paper presents CARLA-GeAR, a tool for the automatic generation of photo-realistic synthetic datasets related to driving scenarios that can be used for a systematic evaluation of the adversarial robustness of neural models against physical adversarial patches, as well as for comparing the performance of different adversarial defense/detection methods. The tool is built on the CARLA simulator, using its Python API, and allows the generation of datasets for several vision tasks in the context of autonomous driving. The adversarial patches included in the generated datasets are attached to billboards or the back of a truck and are crafted by using state-of-the-art white-box attack strategies to maximize the prediction error of the model under test. Finally, the paper presents an experimental study to evaluate the performance of some defense methods against such attacks, showing how the datasets generated with CARLA-GeAR might be used in future work as a benchmark for adversarial defense in the real world.

An Autonomous Attack Decision-Making Method Based on Hierarchical Virtual Bayesian Reinforcement Learning,"In response to the challenges of estimating missile launch timing during close-range unmanned autonomous air combat in the future, this article proposes an autonomous attack decision-making method based on hierarchical virtual Bayesian reinforcement learning (HVBRL). First, a six-degree-of-freedom (6-DOF) high-fidelity aircraft dynamics model, along with missile dynamics and guidance rate models, is constructed. Second, the HVBRL algorithm is introduced, where the low-level algorithm outputs control parameters and the high-level algorithm generates control commands. Given that the number of missile hits on a target under specific conditions follows a binomial distribution, a simple prior knowledge can be introduced through its conjugate prior, the Beta distribution, to avoid prolonged exploration of ineffective areas. Moreover, carrying only a limited number of missiles and predicting the number of hits by multiple virtual missiles in specific states through a neural network circumvent the computational complexity issue associated with carrying an excessive number of missiles. Finally, this article presents the low-level training algorithm, the high-level training algorithm, and the high-level self-play training algorithm. Experimental results show that our method significantly reduces the simulation computational complexity. Compared with the Monte Carlo method carrying 1000 missiles, the simulation speed of the high-level training algorithm is increased by 32.75 times, and that of the high-level self-play algorithm is increased by 23 times. Moreover, the estimated missile hit probability with bias can effectively guide the timing of missile launches in close-range air combat, which has significant implications for intelligent autonomous air combat decision-making and operational analysis.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=10551427,IEEE Transactions on Aerospace and Electronic Systems,2024-01-01
Distributed Data-Driven Control for a Connected Autonomous Vehicle Platoon Subjected to False Data Injection Attacks,"In this paper, we consider the need for deployment in the long-distance safe longitudinal formation control task when the connected autonomous vehicle (CAV) platoon is subjected to malicious cyber attacks. To ensure the safe, orderly, stable and efficient driving performance of the vehicle platoon, a novel distributed data-driven control (DDDC) approach for a homogeneous connected autonomous vehicle platoon under false data injection (FDI) attacks is investigated. First, an FDI attacks detection and compensation mechanism is designed to detect whether the received position signals are under attack or not and compensate the attacked position signals. Then, a novel DDDC approach for the vehicle platoon longitudinal formation control is developed by using the compensation data from the designed attack compensation mechanism and a dynamic linearization data model. Theoretical analysis verifies that the proposed DDDC method can ensure the internal stability (IS) and string stability (SS) of the homogeneous platoon subjected to FDI attacks. Finally, the effectiveness and practicality of the proposed DDDC approach are validated through a group of comparative simulations subjected to random FDI attacks of equal frequency and magnitude. Note to PractitionersâThis work aims to solve the vehicle platoon long-distance safe longitudinal formation control task subjected to malicious FDI attacks. FDI attacks can achieve their destructive purposes by processing intercepted information and injecting false data into the original information. Existing literature overly relies on a priori knowledge of network attacks, yet in practice it is difficult to capture the true intentions of attackers in advance. For multi-channel V2V communication networks, it is even more important to design a resilient and accurate distributed controller strategy for such unpredictable and specific network attacks. Therefore, this paper proposes a data-driven distributed longitudinal formation control strategy with attack detection and compensation mechanism. The proposed strategy is shown to be able to ensure the safe longitudinal formation control task for the homogeneous CAV platoon suffering from FDI attacks. In addition, the stability of the CAV platoon is then investigated while the attacked signals are detected and cleaned, and it is shown to guarantee the internal stability of a single vehicle and the string stability of the platoon.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=10374098,IEEE Transactions on Automation Science and Engineering,2024-01-01
Safe Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning for Wireless Applications Against Adversarial Communications,"Based on the network observations and learning parameters shared by the neighboring learning agents, multi-agent reinforcement learning (RL) has to enhance the performance over adversarial communications, in which spoofing attackers send fake learning messages to fool the learning agent and thus degrade the performance of wireless applications. In this paper, we propose a safe multi-agent RL algorithm for wireless applications against adversarial communications, in which each learning agent chooses the cooperative agents to share the learning information and authenticates the received learning messages before integrating them into the RL state formulation and the learning parameter update. The communication policy distribution for the cooperative agent selection is formulated based on the long-term discounted reward and the sharing reputation for each neighboring agent, which is updated based on the authentication results to indicate the probability as a spoofing attacker. Neural networks are designed to estimate the long-term discounted reward and the sharing reputation for the learning agent with sufficient computational resources in large-scale wireless networks to enhance the agent selection security. As a case study, our proposed algorithm is implemented in the unmanned aerial vehicle swarm anti-jamming video transmission against spoofing attackers that send fake received jamming power as well as Q-values and neural network weights in the anti-jamming transmission policy learning.

Federated Learning-Assisted Distributed Intrusion Detection Using Mesh Satellite Nets for Autonomous Vehicle Protection,"The widespread use of intelligent consumer electronics, specifically autonomous vehicles, has exponentially increased. The key enablers of this pervasive are the Internet of Things (IoT), Artificial Intelligence (AI), and Satellite communications, which provide consumers with highly precise and reliable self-driving vehicles. However, autonomous vehicles come also with significant cybersecurity concerns. Attackers can easily use satellite links to launch cyberattacks against autonomous vehicles. An Intrusion Detection System (IDS) is one of the most effective mechanisms for providing secure autonomous vehicles. However, existing IDSs based on machine and deep learning train their models in a centralized server, which uploads data or parameters to the central server for training. This structure of IDS has challenges with vehicle mobility, brings processing delays, and increases privacy and security risks, affecting vehiclesâ performance. Therefore, for the first time, this paper proposes a new federated learning-assisted distributed IDS using a mesh satellite net to protect autonomous vehicles.

AI-Based Sensor Attack Detection and Classification for Autonomous Vehicles in 6G-V2X Environment,"Autonomous Vehicles (AVs) mainly rely on sensor data and are anticipated to transform the transportation sector. The abnormal sensor readings generated by malicious cyberattacks or defective vehicle sensors can result in deadly crashes. This paper proposes a Sensor Attack Detection and Classification (SADC) framework in a 6G-V2X environment to examine the cybersecurity concern for AVs against sensor attacks. The SADC framework employs GPS and LiDAR sensor attack detectors and the Pattern-based Attack Classification (PAC) algorithm. It combats new-age cyberattacks and provides an accurate sensor attack detection and classification mechanism in AVs. A protocol-based attack detection scheme in SADC is developed to identify the abnormal source sensor based on the detector's results.

VADGAN: An Unsupervised GAN Framework for Enhanced Anomaly Detection in Connected and Autonomous Vehicles,"The utilization of Connected and Autonomous Vehicles (CAVs) is on the rise, driven by their ability to provide vehicular services such as enhancing vehicle safety, aiding in intelligent decision-making, and ensuring continuous operation. CAVs achieve their objectives by employing wireless Vehicle-to-Everything (V2X) communication within Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS) to establish connections with vehicles within the same network and roadside units. However, it has been observed that certain vehicles violate network constraints by transmitting erroneous messages, resulting in abnormal behaviour. Consequently, there is a growing need for a system that can verify the accuracy of information broadcast by each vehicle regarding its vehicle coordinates (along with relevant data depending on the application) at designated frequencies and under authorized pseudo-identities. Addressing the limitations faced by prior generative AI model applications, such as Variational Autoencoders (VAEs), this paper presents an unsupervised anomaly detection framework using Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) optimized for CAVs.

BioKA-ASVN: Biometric-Based Key Agreement Scheme for Air Smart Vehicular Networks Using Blockchain Service,"Air Smart Vehicular Networks (ASVNs) have become increasingly essentials in military and commercial industries in recent years, where drones are deployed to interact among each other via wireless medium in airspace due to their agility and versatility. ASVNs can form a closed loop from data perception to final execution by integrating communication devices, computation tools, and control modules. However, the used unencrypted and publicly available navigational signals like Global Positioning System (GPS) and communication over (public) insecure Internet connections, including wireless networks and WiFi, make ASVNs vulnerable to security breaches. Attackers can easily gain access to a drone's configuration and take control remotely, by launching various attacks such as GPS spoofing, false sensor data injection, maldrone malware injection, eavesdropping, man-in-the-middle, Denial-of-Service (DoS), replay, forgery, and Skyjack attacks. This paper proposes a robust and efficient multi-factor biometric-based security mechanism using blockchain as a service to address the security and privacy breaches in ASVNs. A comparative study demonstrates that the proposed scheme provides superior security and better functionality features with low communication and computation overheads as compared to the existing analogous schemes.

SAFENESS: A Semi-Supervised Transfer Learning Approach for Sea State Estimation Using Ship Motion Data,"Autonomous vessels have been identified as a promising innovation in advancing marine transportation, providing an effective means to mitigate the risk of accidents, pollution incidents, and carbon dioxide emissions. Accurate sea state estimation (SSE) plays a critical role in facilitating onboard decision-making and optimizing operational efficiency for autonomous ships. Traditional SSE approaches relying on external sensors, such as wave buoys and wave radars, are limited by cost considerations. Model-based methods are highly relying on the understanding of human knowledge to ships. Data-driven models also provide promising solutions, but their generalization is low. To address this challenge, a semi-supervised transfer learning approach for SSE (SAFENESS) is proposed. The model is trained using sufficient data in the source ship and limited data from the target ship and finally applied to the target ship. A data alignment algorithm is utilized to use the limited data of the target ship.

Secure and Safe Control of Connected and Automated Vehicles Against False Data Injection Attacks,"This paper studies the secure and safe control problem of connected and automated vehicles (CAVs) with false data injection (FDI) attacks. A secure and safe controller with a novel surrounding vehiclesâ state estimator and an attack detector is proposed. The state estimation for surrounding vehicles is collectively processed by combining the deep neural network-based predictions with model-based estimations. Additionally, a weight in the loss function is proposed for more accurate predictions of vehicles that are closer to the ego vehicle. For attack detection, a novel scheme that utilizes control outcomes to train detection actions is proposed. Different from the objectives of existing detectors, the reward for the proposed detector is designed to encourage the CAV to fully utilize the observations. A reward setting and the decision preference of the ego vehicle are theoretically analyzed. The effectiveness of the proposed algorithm is validated in an open simulation environment.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85188455586&origin=inward,IEEE Transactions on Intelligent Transportation Systems,2024-01-01
A Location-Aware and Healing Attestation Scheme for Air-Supported Internet of Vehicles,"With the rapid technological advancement in the Internet of Things (IoT) and Internet of Vehicles (IoV), we witness exponential growth of Connected and Autonomous Vehicles (CAVs). However, these integrations of IoV with other technologies make the IoV network and its interaction between different network components highly complex. Therefore, ensuring the correct functioning of the firmware and software running on these next-generation vehicles becomes an essential requirement. A feasible method to address the aforementioned security issues is Remote Attestation (RA). However, the advancement in the attackersâ approaches and the increased complexity, large network size, and vehicle mobility allow the attacks to bypass these security solutions, making RA less effective. In this paper, we propose LHASIoV, an attestation and healing protocol for IoV. LHASIoV has many features such as competent-wise (treats different entities of the system differently), geographical location-aware (traces forensics of security breaches and eases healing compromised vehicles), gradual healing (via slicing the healing software) of compromised vehicles, and resistance to single-point-of-failure. We provide proof-of-concept implementation and formal operational and security analysis for LHASIoV. To show its practical feasibility and effectiveness, we provide performance analysis by implementing it on the Omnetpp simulator. The simulation results show that for an IoV system that has 100 vehicles moving with a speed range of 15â25 mph, LHASIoV needed only 5.27 seconds to complete the vehicleâs attestation. For this number of vehicles and compared to the existing protocols, LHASIoV reduced the communication and storage costs on average by 54.46% and 43.92%, respectively.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=10268662,IEEE Transactions on Intelligent Transportation Systems,2024-01-01
Security Control of Autonomous Ground Vehicles Under DoS Attacks via a Novel Controller With the Switching Mechanism,"This article focuses on the security tracking control problem of nonlinear autonomous ground vehicles (AGVs) under denial-of-service (DoS) attacks. In order to resist DoS attacks and other external disturbances, a new security control scheme is proposed. First, the TakagiâSugeno (T-S) fuzzy system is established to represent the nonlinear AGV system under DoS attacks. In particular, in order to improve the flexibility of control and reduce the impact of DoS attacks on tracking control, a novel controller with a specific switching mechanism is designed. The switching mechanism relies on fuzzy membership functions, which can make better use of nonlinear vehicle speed information. Second, the sufficient conditions to ensure global exponential stability of the T-S fuzzy-based switched system are given by using the Lyapunov function method. Finally, the simulation platform built by Carsim and MATLAB/Simulink is used to verify the effectiveness of the proposed control scheme.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=10478642,IEEE Transactions on Fuzzy Systems,2024-01-01
Dynamic Event-Triggered Distributed MPC for Heterogeneous UAVsâUGVs Against DoS Attacks,"In this study, we address the model predictive secure control challenge for a heterogeneous system composed of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) and unmanned ground vehicles (UGVs). Our objective is to cooperatively manage the UAVsâUGVs system to maintain equilibrium in the face of external disturbances and denial of service (DoS) attacks. We introduce a dynamic event-triggered distributed model predictive control (DET-Distributed MPC) approach. Initially, we integrate a robustness constraint into the distributed MPC framework, which incrementally tightens the states bounds, enhancing disturbance resilience. In addition, we devise a neighbor output sequence prediction mechanism to mitigate packet loss effects due to DoS attacks on communication channels. A dynamic event-triggered mechanism with adaptive triggering thresholds, responsive to DoS attack durations, is also developed. We establish sufficient conditions for the recursive feasibility of the MPC algorithm and the stability of the overall system. Comparative tests confirm the DET-Distributed MPC scheme's robustness and security efficacy.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=10591631,IEEE Transactions on Aerospace and Electronic Systems,2024-01-01
UADA3D: Unsupervised Adversarial Domain Adaptation for 3D Object Detection With Sparse LiDAR and Large Domain Gaps,"In this study, we address a gap in existing unsupervised domain adaptation approaches on LiDAR-based 3D object detection, which have predominantly concentrated on adapting between established, high-density autonomous driving datasets. We focus on sparser point clouds, capturing scenarios from different perspectives: not just from vehicles on the road but also from mobile robots on sidewalks, which encounter significantly different environmental conditions and sensor configurations. We introduce Unsupervised Adversarial Domain Adaptation for 3D Object Detection (UADA3D). UADA3D does not depend on pre-trained source models or teacher-student architectures. Instead, it uses an adversarial approach to directly learn domain-invariant features. We demonstrate its efficacy in various adaptation scenarios, showing significant improvements in both self-driving car and mobile robot domains.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85208094064&origin=inward,IEEE Robotics and Automation Letters,2024-01-01
Dynamic Event-Triggered Consensus Cost-Based Switching Control for UAV Formation With Disturbances,"This article focuses on the scene wherein some of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) are destroyed by enemy attacks or accidental crash, the number of plentiful UAVs will reduce, and the communication topology along with the formation construction will change. By calculating the global consensus cost of the UAV formation, a cost-based switching law is designed to determine whether the UAV formation is switched or not. As regards the limited capacity of the network bandwidth, this article designs a distributed dynamic event-triggered mechanism to alleviate the transmission burden. By taking the whole disturbances into account, distributed disturbance observers are established to eliminate the negative influence for each UAV. By means of Kronecker product technique, an integrated controller is conducted for each UAV, which can achieve the consensus for the formation switched system and compensate for the unknown disturbances. On these basis, a closed-loop system with the designed controller and switching law is proved to be exponentially stable. Additionally, the explicit expressions of the controller and disturbance observers gains are determined, respectively. Finally, a simulation based on the UAVs is performed to validate that the designed control algorithm is effective.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=10365537,IEEE Transactions on Intelligent Vehicles,2024-01-01
Multiple Unmanned Aerial Vehicles Coalition Formation and Control for Collaborative Defense Mission,"This article investigates the collaborative defense problem of multiple unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) in a 3-D space with an important area. A two-phase defense strategy is proposed for multiple defending UAVs (defenders) to cooperatively prevent the adversarial UAVs (intruders) from approaching the important area. In the first phase, considering that a single defender may lack the ability to neutralize an intruder independently, a game-theoretical-based coalition formation algorithm is proposed to drive defenders to form different-sized defending coalitions to neutralize multiple intruders with different abilities. In the second phase, once a defending coalition is established, a distributed enclosing control protocol is presented to guide the coalition members to collaboratively form an enclosing configuration around the detected intruder, the purpose of which is to restrict the movement of the intruder. Both the coalition formation algorithm and the enclosing control protocol are designed based on the local interactions with the neighboring defenders, which are scalable and executable. Simulation tests demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed strategy. Meanwhile, the scalability and flexibility of the proposed strategy are also discussed in detail.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=10534867,IEEE Transactions on Aerospace and Electronic Systems,2024-01-01
An Interpretable Image Denoising Framework via Dual Disentangled Representation Learning,"Various unfavourable conditions such as fog, snow and rain may degrade image quality and pose tremendous threats to the safety of autonomous driving. Numerous image-denoising solutions have been proposed to improve visibility under adverse weather conditions. However, previous studies have been limited in robustness, generalization ability, and interpretability as they were designed for specific scenarios. To address this problem, we introduce an interpretable image denoising framework via Dual Disentangled Representation Learning (DDRL) to enhance robustness and interpretability by decomposing an image into content factors (e.g., objects) and context factors (e.g., weather conditions). DDRL consists of two Disentangled Representation Learning (DRL) blocks. In each DRL block, an input image is deconstructed into the latent content distribution and the weather distribution by minimizing their mutual information. To mitigate the impacts of weather styles, we incorporated a content discriminator and adversarial objectives to learn the decomposable interaction between two DRL blocks. Furthermore, we standardized the weather feature space, enabling our method to be applicable to various downstream tasks such as diverse degraded image generation. We evaluated DDRL under three weather conditions including fog, rain, and snow. The experimental results demonstrate that DDRL shows competitive performance with good generalization capability and high robustness under numerous weather conditions. Furthermore, quantitative analysis shows that DDRL can capture interpretable variations of weather factors and decompose them for safe and reliable all-weather autonomous driving.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85177031390&origin=inward,IEEE Transactions on Intelligent Vehicles,2024-01-01
Distributed Cooperative Strategy of UAV Swarm Without Speed Measurement Under Saturation Attack Mission,"In this article, a distributed cooperative strategy based on a saturation attack mission (SAM) with an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) swarm is investigated. Little research has been conducted in this area, especially in relation to aerial moving targets. First, the mathematical model of the UAV swarm and the problem of distributed fencing under SAM are established, respectively. Second, aimed at the target's defense system, a calculation model of assigned UAVs is designed to ensure that the minimum number of UAVs is required to carry out the mission. Then, considering one situation that the entire swarm is not loaded speed measurement and at least one UAV can detect the moving-target's position, a distributed cooperative control scheme without a preset formation is proposed. It includes a distributed position observer and a fencing controller, which inspired by swarm behaviors and consensus theory. Furthermore, the speed information of each UAV is replaced by introducing an auxiliary state. This controller realizes target-fencing without collision between UAVs. Finally, the effectiveness of the developed strategy is demonstrated through numerical simulations.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=10483291,IEEE Transactions on Aerospace and Electronic Systems,2024-01-01
"Privacy-Aware Remote Identification for Unmanned Aerial Vehicles: Current Solutions, Potential Threats, and Future Directions","The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) recently introduced a new standard, namely, remote identification, to improve accountability for unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) operations. This rule requires UAV operators to broadcast messages revealing sensitive data, such as identity and location on the wireless channel. However, this leads to security and privacy concerns among UAV operators. Unauthorized parties may easily discover the location and identity of a UAV flying in a specific area and launch attacks on it such as using wireless jamming or tracking its activity. This review investigates and systematizes the main weaknesses affecting the Remote ID capability required of modern UAVs, and the approaches through which attackers can exploit these weaknesses to disrupt safety and accountability. Moreover, this article analyzes current solutions that mitigate privacy issues associated with Remote ID.

ESUAV-NI: Endogenous Security Framework for UAV Perception System Based on Neural Immunity,"Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) represent an essential component of advanced intelligent equipment that can be used as an aerial perception system by installing various sensors such as vision, hearing, touch, taste, and smell to achieve intelligently integrated perception of environments. However, these perception system with environmental information may be threatened by various internal and external attacks, causing a great challenge to the security of the UAV. The original security system relied on an expert knowledge base to prevent attacks, but the weaknesses of lacking proactivity and flexibility are gradually exposed. The strong resistance and survivability of biological systems can be used to fill this capability gap and provide new ideas for the security of the UAV perception system. Therefore, an endogenous security framework (ESUAV-NI) based on the neural system and immune system is proposed in this article. Through breeding artificial intelligence (AI) vaccines and distributed neural hierarchical control, we achieve the security protection for the UAV perception system. Moreover, we evaluated the AI vaccine breeding approach in the ESUAV-NI by conducting extensive experiments on internal threats and external aerial imagery camouflage data, respectively. The results show that the proposed approach has a superior performance for the UAV perception system.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=10111025,IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics,2024-01-01
Secure Sampled-Data Consensus of Multi-Agent Systems Under Asynchronous Deception Attacks With Application to Unmanned Surface Vehicles,"This paper studies the secure sampled-data consensus of multi-agent systems (MASs) under asynchronous independent deception attacks and multiplicative control gain disturbances by developing the looped Lyapunov-Krasovskii functional (LKF) approach. Because of the openness and shareability of communication network, as well as the time delay in the process of data transmission, two independent deception attacks with asynchronous phenomenon are considered in the sensor-to-controller (SC) and controller-to-actuator (CA) channel of MAS communication network. Furthermore, a coupled memory-based sampled-data control scheme is proposed and fractional-delay states on sampling intervals are introduced to construct an improved delay-dependent looped LKF. Therefore, a relaxed condition with lower conservatism is established to asymptotically ensure the secure sampled-data consensus of MASs in mean square under our designed control protocol. Finally, a simulation test applied to unmanned surface vehicles is conducted to validated the performance of designed control strategy.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=10328540,IEEE Transactions on Intelligent Transportation Systems,2024-01-01
Latency-Free Driving Scene Prediction for On-Road Teledriving With Future-Image-Generation,"Teledriving could serve as a practical solution for handling unforeseen situations in autonomous driving. However, the latency of transmission networks remains a prominent concern. Despite advancements like 5G networks, delays in remote driving scenes cannot be entirely eradicated, potentially leading to unwanted incidents. While a few attempts have been made to address this issue by predicting the future driving scenes, these efforts have been restricted in their ability to accurately foresee clear and relevant driving scenarios. This study presents a method to predict a latency-free future driving scene. Unlike prior approaches, our method incorporates the command signal of a remote driver into the prediction network, as well as the past driving video frames and vehicle status. As a result, we can accurately predict relevant and clear latency-free future driving scenes. A combination of convolutional long short-term memory (ConvLSTM) and generative adversarial networks (GAN) was utilized in a deep neural network to predict the future driving scenes based on latency. The dataset was gathered from on-road teledriving experiments, with a maximum vehicle speed of 53 km/h and a driving route length of approximately 1.3 km. The dataset used to train the deep neural network was gathered from on-road teledriving experiments. The proposed method can estimate the future driving scene for up to 0.5 s, surpassing the performance of both baseline video prediction methods and a method that does not utilize the input command of the driver.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=10624599,IEEE Transactions on Intelligent Transportation Systems,2024-01-01
Lane Segmentation Data Augmentation for Heavy Rain Sensor Blockage Using Realistically Translated Raindrop Images and CARLA Simulator,"Lane segmentation and Lane Keeping Assist System (LKAS) play a vital role in autonomous driving. While deep learning technology has significantly improved the accuracy of lane segmentation, real-world driving scenarios present various challenges. In particular, heavy rainfall not only obscures the road with sheets of rain and fog but also creates water droplets on the windshield or lens of the camera that affects the lane segmentation performance. There may even be a false positive problem in which the algorithm incorrectly recognizes a raindrop as a road lane. Collecting heavy rain data is challenging in real-world settings, and manual annotation of such data is expensive. In this research, we propose a realistic raindrop conversion process that employs a contrastive learning-based Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) model to transform raindrops randomly generated using Python libraries. In addition, we utilize the attention mask of the lane segmentation model to guide the placement of raindrops in training images from the translation target domain (real Rainy-Images). By training the ENet-SAD model using the realistically Translated-Raindrop images and lane ground truth automatically extracted from the CARLA Simulator, we observe an improvement in lane segmentation accuracy in Rainy-Images. This method enables training and testing of the perception model while adjusting the number, size, shape, and direction of raindrops, thereby contributing to future research on autonomous driving in adverse weather conditions.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=10504424,IEEE Robotics and Automation Letters,2024-01-01
UGEN: UAV and GAN-Aided Ensemble Network for Post-Disaster Survivor Detection Through ORAN,"Post-disaster scene understanding frameworks are increasingly crucial in Search And Rescue (SAR) operations. Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) provide an efficient means to carry out the task of scene understanding due to the higher altitudes at which they function. However, complex environments in post-disaster scenarios make it difficult for UAVs to detect humans or objects accurately. Inefficient object detection mechanisms lead to low accuracy for object detection tasks. Hence, to mitigate these issues, we propose a UAV and GAN-aided Ensemble Network (UGEN) framework for efficient ORAN-based post-disaster survivor detection. This approach deploys a Context-Conditional Generative Adversarial Network (CCGAN)-based model to remove occlusion in the images obtained from the UAVs. The UGEN framework classifies entities present in the visual scope of the UAV using a semantic segmentation framework deployed on the CCGAN-enhanced images, resulting in a pixel-level prediction of entities present in the post-disaster images. An ensemble network comprising a combination of single-stage and multi-stage detectors detects survivors present in the post-disaster scenario, thereby combining the benefits of both architectures, resulting in a reduced false negative rate and improved performance. An Open Radio Access Network (ORAN) executes data propagation between the UAV and the ground station for reduced transmission latency. The proposed model achieved a survivor detection accuracy of 96.7%.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=10380459,IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology,2024-01-01

The benefits of VCC in VCN are superior, including faster turnover times, scalability, flexibility, cost savings, greater collaborations, advanced security, the prevention of data loss, data security, minimal maintenance, limitless storage capacity, traffic information aggregation, etc. VCN is an intelligent networking system that manages autonomous traffic, system security, privacy, and vehicle control capabilities. During communication, various adversary types have the potential to compromise the security and privacy of these networks. To preserve their security, privacy, confidentiality, and integrity, such systems require an authentication framework. The paper presents an elliptic curve cryptography (ECC) and biometrics-based secure authenticated framework for VCN. The suggested protocol accomplishes all security, privacy, and other criteria for secure communications against active and passive attackers. It is also demonstrated, both formally and informally, that the proposed framework is secure, correct and efficient. The study further establishes, using the simulation tool AVISPA, that the proposed protocol is secure against man-in-the-middle and replay attacks. Additionally, the study uses BAN logic to demonstrate how the mutual authentication property is proven. In VCN, the proposed protocol efficacy is evaluated and compared to other similar protocols within the study. The results show that the proposed framework is secure and efficient in terms of computation and communication overheads. Consequently, the proposed protocol will be advantageous for VCN.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=10287859,IEEE Transactions on Intelligent Transportation Systems,2024-01-01
Attack Resilient Fault Tolerant Control for TâS Fuzzy Cyber-Physical Systems,"In this article, a novel secure fault-tolerant control (FTC) strategy is proposed to deal with the impact of multiple threats such as sparse sensor attacks, system faults, and unknown disturbances on TâS fuzzy cyber-physical systems (CPSs). First, under the assumption of 2s-detectability, a set of robust local unknown input observers is designed. Specifically, each observer can decouple partial disturbances and perform targeted suppression on undecoupling disturbances simultaneously. Next, the residual-based attack detection strategy and secure global estimation fusion mechanism are developed, leading to the estimation of the state and concerned fault with smaller estimation error.

Anti-Jamming Colonel Blotto Game for Underwater Acoustic Backscatter Communication,"Underwater acoustic backscatter communication, which allows an underwater sensor node (USN) to communicate with the surface sink node (SN) by reflecting the acoustic signal from the SN, is a promising solution for enabling the Internet of Underwater Things. However, underwater backscattering is vulnerable to jamming attacks, especially from a gliding autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV) that can inject jamming signal to the underwater acoustic channel accordingly. This article considers the attack-defense interactions between the AUV jammer and the SN defender in their transmit power allocations of jamming signals and acoustic signals over multiple USNs. We formulate the strategic power allocation problem for the SN and AUV as an asymmetric anti-jamming Colonel Blotto (CB) game model with a finite budget of total transmit powers. In particular, the competitive interactions between the SN and the AUV is modeled as the competition of two players in the game for limited resource budgets over the battlefield set. We analyze the mixed-strategy Nash equilibrium to the game, and obtain the closed-form performance bound of the defense power allocation strategy. Numerical results show the superiority of the proposed CB game based multi-USN secure transmission scheme as compared to the benchmarks in terms of the expected sum-utility.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=10440551,IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology,2024-01-01

Secure Reachable Set Synthesis and Reliable Event-Driven Mechanism for TâS Fuzzy Semi-Markovian Networked Control Systems Against Deception Attacks,"This article aims to investigate the problems of secure reachability set synthesis and reliable event-driven mechanism design for TakagiâSugeno (TâS) fuzzy semi-Markovian network control system (S-MNCS) subjected to external disturbances. To this end, important issues, such as actuator failures, stochastic jump parameters, and stochastic deception attacks occurring in the transmission network are given priority consideration during the design of the controller scheme. At this time, the stochastic parameters are generated using a semi-Markov process, where the transition rate varies depending on the sojourn time. Next, a novel mode-dependent fuzzy event trigger control mechanism for S-MNCS is proposed to achieve reliable performance against actuator failure and deception attacks, reduce unnecessary communication, and improve communication efficiency. Then, a new integral inequality based on free-weight matrices is introduced to minimize model conservatism using the knowledge of the aperiodic sampling pattern. Meanwhile, for the purpose of reducing conservatism, an augmented double-sided looped-type Lyapunov functional (ADSLLF) using membership functions information is introduced to take the available information of the actual sampling pattern. Then, by combing the ADSLLF and the proposed free-matrix integral inequality, some sufficient conditions in terms of linear matrix inequalities are derived such that all states of the systems included by an ellipsoid region. Finally, the efficiency and applicability of the approach proposed in this study are demonstrated through the simulation of networked autonomous electric vehicle systems, and its superiority is proven by comparing it with the existing method through the simulation of a well-known Rossler system.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=10494533,IEEE Transactions on Fuzzy Systems,2024-01-01
Secure Wireless Networks: AI-Driven UAV Data Relay,"The openness of wireless networks makes sensing data collection tasks vulnerable to jamming attacks. Techniques such as frequency hopping or spoofing are not suitable for multiuser data transmission scenarios because they require additional channels or come at the expense of designated usersâ benefits. Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), with their advantage of communication coverage and channel quality, have become an effective paradigm for anti-jamming through data relay. However, current research primarily focuses on transmitting devices in stationary environments. When these devices are in motion, such as in the case of UAVs performing data relay, they may encounter challenges including degradation in channel quality and failures in coverage. In this paper, we propose employing a UAV to consistently track mobile devices(MDs), ensuring superior channel quality while simultaneously providing data relay. To address the unpredictable movement of MDs and varying jamming power, we formulate the UAVâs interaction within the existing environment as a Markov Decision Process (MDP). Our approach involves joint optimization of UAV flight speed, direction, and relay decisions to minimize data transmission delay. We then propose the Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient (DDPG) to account for the non-convexity of the optimization problem. Additionally, we consider the complexity and frequency of the action space, decomposing it, and optimizing it by alternating between upper and lower-level policies. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed scheme can quickly converge to the optimal solution, significantly reducing data transmission delays.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85196056784&origin=inward,IEEE Transactions on Consumer Electronics,2024-01-01
Designing Anonymous Key Agreement Scheme for Secure Vehicular Ad-Hoc Networks,"Presently, the Vehicular Ad-hoc Network (VANET) is very important for the entire traffic management system. The 5th Generation (5G) enables VANET and Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS) to connect devices in the million/sqkm range with improved performance, incredible transmission speed (terabit), and less cost to serve a vast, transformative, and diverse automobile sector. To ensure security and avoid the free flow of information in highly scalable, dynamic 5G, there are many challenges to restrict unauthenticated users access and proper key agreements with fine-grained access control. Here, a lightweight biometrics-based dynamic Anonymous Key Agreement Scheme (AKAS) with a fine-grained authentication feature is proposed to address challenges related to the restriction of unauthenticated users access and proper key agreement with fine-grained access control specifically for Vehicle-to-Vehicle (V2V) communication in VANET. In the proposed scheme, registered and authorized users can access services or information as per access privilege only. We have simulated our scheme using Automated Validation of Internet Security Protocols (AVISPA), Simulation of Urban MObility (SUMO), OMNET++ (Objective Modular Network Testbed in C++), and performed formal security analysis using the Real-or-Random (ROR) oracle model. Analysis and simulation results show that our scheme is secured against various well-known attacks. Further, we have compared the security and efficiency of our scheme with the existing schemes and found that our proposed protocol is more secure, lighter, 5G-friendly, scalable, and even faster than the other related schemes.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=10475132,IEEE Transactions on Intelligent Transportation Systems,2024-01-01
Flexible and Secure Cross-Domain Signcrypted Data Authorization in Multi-Platoon Vehicular Networks,"Autonomous Vehicle Platooning (AVP) presents a promising approach to reducing energy expenses, improving traffic safety, and enhancing capacity. In multi-platoon vehicular networks, platoons can collaborate to ensure better data transfer reliability. However, the existing secure information-sharing methods between platoons face efficiency and security challenges. These challenges arise from (1) a lack of an efficient method to simultaneously ensure confidentiality, authenticity, and non-repudiation of the transmitted information; (2) difficulty in cross-domain dynamically sharing ciphertexts to multiple recipients is challenging. To overcome these challenges, we propose a Flexible Cross-domain Data Access Control (FC-DAC) system in this paper. Our FC-DAC system ensures confidentiality, authenticity, and non-repudiation of transmitted information while enabling high-efficiency ciphertext sharing between various platoons. Additionally, the FC-DAC solution allows vehicles with valid authorizations to access signcrypted information quickly and efficiently, even if they belong to different platoons. Our theoretical and experimental analysis demonstrates that the FC-DAC scheme is resistant to various common attacks and is applicable to multi-platoon vehicular networks.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=10287852,IEEE Transactions on Intelligent Transportation Systems,2024-01-01
Performance Analysis of Blockchain-Enabled Security and Privacy Algorithms in Connected and Autonomous Vehicles: A Comprehensive Review,"Strategic investment(s) in vehicle automation technologies led to the rapid development of technology that revolutionised transport services and reduced fatalities on a scale never seen before. Technological advancements and their integration in Connected Autonomous Vehicles (CAVs) increased uptake and adoption and pushed firmly for the development of highly supportive legal and regulatory and testing environments.

STGlow: A Flow-Based Generative Framework With Dual-Graphormer for Pedestrian Trajectory Prediction,"The pedestrian trajectory prediction task is an essential component of intelligent systems. Its applications include but are not limited to autonomous driving, robot navigation, and anomaly detection of monitoring systems. Due to the diversity of motion behaviors and the complex social interactions among pedestrians, accurately forecasting their future trajectory is challenging. Existing approaches commonly adopt generative adversarial networks (GANs) or conditional variational autoencoders (CVAEs) to generate diverse trajectories. However, GAN-based methods do not directly model data in a latent space, which may make them fail to have full support over the underlying data distribution. CVAE-based methods optimize a lower bound on the log-likelihood of observations, which may cause the learned distribution to deviate from the underlying distribution. The above limitations make existing approaches often generate highly biased or inaccurate trajectories. In this article, we propose a novel generative flow-based framework with a dual-graphormer for pedestrian trajectory prediction (STGlow). Different from previous approaches, our method can more precisely model the underlying data distribution by optimizing the exact log-likelihood of motion behaviors. Besides, our method has clear physical meanings for simulating the evolution of human motion behaviors. The forward process of the flow gradually degrades complex motion behavior into simple behavior, while its reverse process represents the evolution of simple behavior into complex motion behavior. Furthermore, we introduce a dual-graphormer combined with the graph structure to more adequately model the temporal dependencies and the mutual spatial interactions. Experimental results on several benchmarks demonstrate that our method achieves much better performance compared to previous state-of-the-art approaches.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=10195882,IEEE Transactions on Neural Networks and Learning Systems,2024-01-01

First, innovative compression rules are introduced to mitigate network congestion and bandwidth utilization issues stemming from quality of service (QoS) queuing mechanisms and denial of service (DoS) attacks. We develop an intelligent trigger controller supervised by a mini-batch machine learning (MBML) algorithm to optimize network bandwidth utilization. Furthermore, we formulate more generalized Lyapunov-Krasovskii functions (LKFs) to simplify mathematical derivations, and we employ appropriate integral inequalities to minimize constraints.

Performance Analysis and Design of Intelligent Optimising Integral-Based Event-Trigger Control for Autonomous Ground Vehicles Under DoS Attacks,"This study investigates the stability of an autonomous ground vehicle dynamics model in the presence of novel denial of service (DoS) attacks. An algorithm that utilizes an asymmetric Lyapunov-Krasovskii function to reduce decision variables effectively is proposed. By partitioning the LKF for asymmetric LKF trimming, we ensure a tighter upper bound on the remaining part of the function using appropriate integral inequalities. Additionally, an improved alternating direction algorithm (ADA) is employed to optimize the threshold selection problem while considering initial constraints. Subsequently, we design an intelligent integral-based event-triggering controller (IIETC) that incorporates random trigger signal loss to guarantee AGV stability. We conduct a series of experiments utilizing the CarSim-Simulink AGV joint platform. The experimental results serve to validate the effectiveness and superiority of our proposed method.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85173049371&origin=inward,IEEE Transactions on Intelligent Vehicles,2024-01-01
Vehicular Ad Hoc Networks Topology Optimization for Autonomous Intersection Management System: A Periodic Intervention-Based Approach,"It is important to achieve the real-time and reliable vehicular ad hoc networks (VANETs) for the safety and efficiency of the autonomous intersection management (AIM) system. However, there are challenges in establishing the low-delay and robustness VANETs topology in a horizon due to the high mobility, intersection shelters and malicious attacks. This paper investigates the long-horizon VANETs networking problem with the objective of producing the robust topology in the process of routing paths planning. To achieve this goal, a centralized periodic intervention networking (CPIN) approach is proposed, which consists of three main modules: long-horizon information mapping, full-path routing modeling and proactive optimization mechanism. The first module aims to provide a spatio-temporal delay tensor, considering the mobility and the quality of service (QoS). The second module converts routing path planning into a combinatorial optimization problem to achieve long-horizon full-path routing. The third module introduces a proactive optimization mechanism based on node degree centrality to evolve the VANETs networking process toward high robustness. To find the optimal solution efficiently, we propose an improved Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) algorithm based on the operational characteristics of the AIM system. A series of simulation experiments are carried out to verify the effectiveness of CPIN. The results show that the CPIN outperforms the benchmark method in terms of time delay, wireless hops, and network robustness. Specifically, the CPIN reduces the average time delay by at most 44.4%-48.3% while ensuring relative high robustness.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85196735675&origin=inward,IEEE Transactions on Intelligent Transportation Systems,2024-01-01

Covert Communication in Large-Scale Multi-Tier LEO Satellite Networks,"We leverage covert communication to enhance the security of a large-scale multi-tier Low Earth Orbit (LEO) satellite network against vigilant adversarial terrestrial Base Stations (BSs) aiming at detecting satellite transmissions. This approach involves deploying massive LEO satellites at different altitudes around Earth to form a multi-tier network serving as a backhaul for near-ground Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) that provide network services to terrestrial mobile users. Meanwhile, terrestrial BSs attempt to detect satellite transmissions based on their own received signal powers. To evade detection, the LEO satellite network performs power control to obscure the satellite transmission within the co-channel interference among the LEO satellites. We formulate a two-stage Stackelberg game to model the conflict dynamics between the terrestrial BSs and the LEO satellite network. In this game, the terrestrial BSs act as non-cooperative followers at the lower stage aiming to minimize their detection errors. On the other hand, the LEO satellite network acts as the leader at the upper stage aiming to maximize its utility while ensuring communication covertness. In contrast to existing works that focus on a small set of network nodes, our study considers a large-scale multi-tier LEO satellite network and employs stochastic geometry to model the spatial distribution of network nodes. To achieve the Stackelberg equilibrium, we develop a bi-level algorithm based on Successive Convex Approximation (SCA) and golden-section search. Our numerical results provide practical insights, revealing a trade-off in leveraging co-channel interference (i.e., while it improves the communication covertness of satellite transmission, it simultaneously degrades the link reliability).",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=10520820,IEEE Transactions on Mobile Computing,2024-01-01
Secure Offloading With Adversarial Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning Against Intelligent Eavesdroppers in UAV-Enabled Mobile Edge Computing,"Mobile edge computing (MEC) has attracted widespread attention due to its ability to effectively alleviate the cloud computing load and significantly reduce latency. However, the potential eavesdroppers challenge the security of the MEC systems and the rapid development of artificial intelligence (AI) has made this security situation more severe. In most existing studies, the eavesdroppers are non-intelligent and it is assumed that they are fixed or move in a simple manner. Obviously, there is a gap from such an assumption to the real conditions that the eavesdropping unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) may adjust their flight paths intelligently. To better reflect real-world scenarios, we consider a multi-UAV-assisted MEC system in the presence of intelligent eavesdroppers and propose an adversarial multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL)-based scheme for secure computational offloading and resource allocation. With this scheme, we aim to solve the zero-sum game between the legitimate UAVs and the eavesdropping UAVs, in which the two types of UAVs take turns acting as the agents of MARL to alternately optimize their respective opposing objectives. The simulation experimental results indicate that the proposed scheme significantly outperforms the existing baseline methods in dealing with the intelligent eavesdropping UAVs, and ensures high energy efficiency of Internet of Things (IoT) devices even in the worst-case scenario when dealing with potential eavesdropping threats.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85200803693&origin=inward,IEEE Transactions on Mobile Computing,2024-01-01
PhaDe: Practical Phantom Spoofing Attack Detection for Autonomous Vehicles,"Despite their prevalence and indispensability in the perception modules of autonomous vehicles, cameras have shown susceptibility to numerous attacks. Among them, the phantom spoofing attack is of significant concern. In such attacks, malefactors employ electronic display devices like projectors and display monitors to generate deceptive objects, thereby duping the object detectors in autonomous vehicles. However, existing detection methodologies are narrowly focused on a single device category, ignoring the multitude of devices that could be leveraged for attacks. Furthermore, the artificial modality-based solution presently in use lacks efficacious fusion mechanisms. In response to these limitations, we propose PhaDe, a practical deep learning-based system adept at detecting phantom spoofing attacks from a variety of and even unfamiliar attack devices. Our approach introduces two image processing techniques to construct artificial modalities and further advances a multi-head self-attention MSA-based fusion module for more versatile integration of disparate modalities. To boost the generalization capacity of our system against novel, unseen attacks, we incorporate two representation-level losses to align feature distributions from various domains. Evaluations conducted on our own dataset, encompassing fake objects from several device types, attest to the efficacy of our system. Our results indicate an accuracy of 98.80% on familiar domains and a detection success rate of 94.03% on unfamiliar domains. Additionally, PhaDe demonstrates a swift response time, fulfilling the practicality requisites.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85187975192&origin=inward,IEEE Transactions on Information Forensics and Security,2024-01-01
Distributed Adaptive Event-Triggered Control of Connected Automated Vehicle Platoon Systems With Spoofing Cyber Attacks,"Due to the utilization of Cellular Vehicle-to-Everything (C-V2X) wireless communication network, the communication process of connected automated vehicle platoon systems is susceptible to external malicious attacks. This paper proposes an effective distributed control framework for connected automated vehicle platoon systems in the presence of spoofing cyber attacks. Firstly, Bernoulli random variables are utilized to model the random nature of spoofing attacks within the platoon systems, and an adaptive event-based communication strategy is adopted to optimize network resource utilization and prevent redundant information transmission. Secondly, a distributed state-feedback controller is designed, leveraging both the adaptive event-triggered approach and the linear matrix inequality (LMI) approach, considering the influence of random and energy-limited spoofing attacks. Thirdly, through the application of the Lyapunov stability theory, the system with the platooning controller, despite the presence of spoofing cyber attacks, is proved to be asymptotically stable. Finally, numerical examples are presented to demonstrate the feasibility and effectiveness of the proposed controller.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=10630698,IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology,2024-01-01
Worst Perception Scenario Search via Recurrent Neural Controller and K-Reciprocal Re-Ranking,"Achieving excellent generalization on perceiving real traffic scenarios with diversity is the long-term goal for building robust autonomous driving systems. A recent theoretical study shows that the generalization on the worst-group of test samples is far more difficult than others. Therefore, we propose to discover potential shortness of certain perception module by analyzing its worst-scenario performance. However, with the benchmark datasets growing huge and tremendous, exhaustive searching for the worst perception scenario (WPS) seems to be time consuming and unnecessary. To address this, we present an automatic searching scheme empowered by reinforcement learning. In this case, worst scenario mining is formulated as the discrete search on the Visual Operation Design Domain (ODD), namely scenario representation, by optimizing LSTM-RNN controller with the worst-performance reward. Moreover, a time-efficient K-reciprocal re-ranking technique is utilized to match the predicted scenario parameters with existing test data. The proposed method has been validated by finding the most challenging scenarios for various vehicle detectors on KITTI, BDD100k and our own benchmark set EVB. Furthermore, searching performances w.r.t different Visual ODDs are investigated and it is found that visual representations through generative adversarial network contribute to a better performance.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=10367809,IEEE Transactions on Intelligent Transportation Systems,2024-01-01
Underwater Motion Deblurring Based on Cascaded Attention Mechanism,"The images captured in the underwater scene frequently suffer from blur effects due to the insufficient light and the relative motion between the captured scenes and the imaging system, which severely hinders the visual-based exploration and investigation of the ocean. In this article, we propose a feature pyramid attention network (FPAN) to remove the motion blur and restore the blurry underwater images. FPAN incorporates the cascaded attention modules into the feature pyramid network, enabling it to learn more discriminative information. To facilitate the training of FPAN, we construct a weighted loss function, which consists of a content loss, an adversarial loss, and a perceptual loss. The cascaded attention module and the weighted loss function enable our proposed FPAN to generate more realistic high-quality images from the blurry underwater images. In addition, to deal with the lack of publicly available datasets in underwater image deblurring, we built two specific underwater deblurring datasets, namely Underwater Convolutional Deblurring Dataset and Underwater Multiframe Averaging Deblurring Dataset, to train and examine different deep learning-based networks. Finally, we conduct sea trial experiments on our autonomous underwater vehicle. Experimental results on two underwater deblurring datasets demonstrate that our proposed method achieves satisfactory results, which validates the potential practical values of our proposed method in real-world applications.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85131572785&origin=inward,IEEE Journal of Oceanic Engineering,2024-01-01
Sonar Image Generation by MFA-CycleGAN for Boosting Underwater Object Detection of AUVs,"Acquiring large amounts of high-quality real sonar data for object detection of autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs) is challenging. Synthetic data can be an alternative, but it is hard to generate diverse data using traditional generative models when real data are limited. This study proposes a novel style transfer method, i.e., the multigranular feature alignment cycle-consistent generative adversarial network (CycleGAN), to generate sonar images leveraging remote sensing images, which can alleviate the dependence on real sonar data. Specifically, we add a spatial attention-based feature aggregation module to preserve unique features by attending to instance parts of an image. A pair of cross-domain discriminators are designed to guide generators to produce images that capture sonar styles. We also introduce a novel cycle consistency loss based on the discrete cosine transform of images, which better utilizes features that are evident in the frequency domain. Extensive experimental results show that the generated sonar images have better quality than CycleGAN, with improvements of 15.2% in IS, 56.9% in FID, 42.6% in KID, and 7.6% in learned perceptual image patch similarity, respectively. Moreover, after expanding the real sonar dataset with generated data, the average accuracy of the object detector, e.g., YOLOv6, has increased by more than 48.7%, indicating the effectiveness of the generated sonar data by our method.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=10472044,IEEE Journal of Oceanic Engineering,2024-01-01
Finite-Time Security Control of Networked Unmanned Marine Vehicle Systems Subject to DoS Attack,"The finite-time dynamic positioning controller design problem of the unmanned marine vehicle (UMV) system under switching DoS attacks is investigated. Firstly, an adaptive memory-based event-triggering communication mechanism (METCM) is designed to save networked resources in maritime environment. Second, the signals released by the communication mechanism are quantized to further reduce the bandwidth of the communication network. In addition, since adversary may have multiple attack strategies, thus a hierarchical semi-Markov process (HS-MP) is presented to capture the phenomenon of switching DoS attacks, which makes the attack model more realistic. Further, sufficient conditions are proposed for the finite-time boundedness (FTB) of the UMV system and some linear matrix inequalities are solved to determine the finite-time bounded controller gain. Finally, the effectiveness of the proposed control method is demonstrated by a simulation example.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=10381861,IEEE Transactions on Intelligent Vehicles,2024-01-01
Edge-Based Event-Triggered Platooning Control of Heterogeneous Connected Automated Vehicles Under Replay Attacks,"This paper investigates the problem of secure platooning control of heterogeneous connected automated vehicles under replay attacks. An edge-based dynamic event-triggered mechanism (DETM) is developed to relieve the vehicle-to-vehicle communication burden among the connected platoon. Different from the widely used constant time headway policies, a refined constant time headway (RCTH) policy that leverages the relative velocity between adjacent vehicles is adopted to enhance platooning safety while preserving traffic efficiency. To deal with the discrepancy of vehicle dynamic parameters, heterogeneity compensators are developed for each platoon member to estimate the platoon leader's state. By virtue of the switching system theory, the desired parameters of heterogeneity compensators are designed and the tolerable condition of replay attacks is also established. Furthermore, sufficient design criteria are derived to obtain the local compensator-based controller gains under the proposed edge-based DETM and RCTH policy. It is further proved that Zeno freeness of the proposed edge-based DETMs is excluded. Finally, co-simulations of Matlab/Simulink and CarSim are carried out to verify the efficacy of the derived results.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=10577479,IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology,2024-01-01
A Multilevel Electronic Control Unit Re-Encryption Scheme for Autonomous Vehicles,"Electronic control units (ECUs) connected by a controller area network (CAN) are used to perform various functions in modern vehicles. In the latest autonomous vehicles, redundant ECUs and a backup bus (different from CAN) are always equipped to prevent a single point of failure or network attack. However, due to the lack of protection measures of CAN bus, attackers can remotely intrude into the vehicle. Many schemes have proposed to use encryption to solve the security problem of CAN bus. Considering the current ECU storage space is limited, it is impossible to store all ECUsâ keys. When a single point of failure or network attack against an ECU occurs, it is necessary for the backup ECU to process the messages related to the failed ECU. How to ensure that the backup ECU can decrypt the encrypted messages and at the same time securely isolates the backbone network from the backup network is an urgent issue to be solved. In order to solve the problem of forwarding and processing such messages under encryption conditions, we propose an efficient re-encryption scheme based on proxy re-encryption. The scheme is also suitable for cross-bus communication without backup networks. Burrows-Abadi-Needham (BAN) logic, random oracle model and Automated Validation of Internet Security Protocols and Applications (AVISPA) tool are utilized to prove that the scheme is secure. The scheme is simulated based on the MIRACL cryptography library on the computer and Raspberry Pi. The simulation results demonstrate that the proposed scheme is secure compared with the existing scheme.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85171802651&origin=inward,IEEE Transactions on Intelligent Transportation Systems,2024-01-01
liteGAP: Lightweight Group Authentication Protocol for Internet of Drones Systems,"Over the past few years, the synergic usage of unmanned aerial vehicles (later drones) and Internet of Things (IoT) has successfully transformed into the Internet of Drones (IoD) paradigm, where the data of interest is gathered and delivered to the Zone Service Provider (ZSP) by drones for substantial additional analysis. Considering the sensitivity of collected information and the impact of information disclosure, information privacy and security issues should be resolved properly so that the maximum potential of IoD can be realized in the increasingly complex cyber threat environment. Ideally, an authentication and key agreement protocol can be adopted to establish secure communications between drones and the ZSP in an insecure environment. Nevertheless, a large group of drones authenticating with the ZSP simultaneously will lead to a severe authentication signaling congestion, which inevitably degrades the quality of service (QoS) of IoD systems. To properly address the above-mentioned issues, a lightweight group authentication protocol, called liteGAP, is proposed in this paper. liteGAP can achieve the authenticated key establishment between a group of drones and the ZSP concurrently in the IoD environment using lightweight operations such as hash function, bitwise XOR, and physical unclonable function (PUF). We verify liteGAP using AVISPA (a tool for the automatic verification of security protocols) and conduct formal and informal security analysis, proving that liteGAP meets all pre-defined security requirements and withstand various potential cyber attacks. Moreover, we develop an experimental framework and conduct extensive experiments on liteGAP and two benchmark schemes (e.g., GASE and rampIoD). Experimental findings show that liteGAP outperforms its counterparts in terms of computational cost as well as communication overhead.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=10325618,IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology,2024-01-01
Zero-Sum-Game-Based Distributed Fuzzy Adaptive Self-Triggered Control of Swarm UAVs Under Intermittent Communication and DoS Attacks,"This article addresses the distributed zero-sum differential game adaptive control problem of six-rotor unmanned aerial vehicles under denial-of-service attacks based on the self-triggered mechanism. First, a fuzzy-logic-system-based identifier-critic framework is structured to obtain the alternative approximate solution with fewer learning parameters. Then, a novel optimal value function, considering the optimal control signal, worst disturbance signal, steady-state, and dynamic performances, is designed. Subsequently, an improved self-triggered strategy, featuring negative feedback adjustment between the threshold and system consensus error, is proposed to reduce the communication resource loss and decrease the influence of introducing the self-triggered mechanism on the system performance. Unlike the event-triggered strategy, the next trigger moment of the self-triggered strategy is determined by the current information, eliminating the need for continuous monitoring of the trigger state, which is more convenient for the physical implementation. Moreover, the connectivity-broken denial-of-service attacks on the information transmission process among unmanned aerial vehicles are considered. Next, through the transformation between stabilization control and cooperative control, the difficulty of realizing cooperative control caused by the temporarily disrupted topological relationships due to denial-of-service attacks is solved effectively. Using Lyapunov stability theory, it is proved that all signals of six-rotor unmanned aerial vehicles are bounded, and the consensus control performance is achieved. Finally, the rationality of the designed zero-sum differential game adaptive control scheme is verified by some simulation results.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=10587057,IEEE Transactions on Fuzzy Systems,2024-01-01

Resilient Distributed Fixed-Time Tracking of Heterogeneous UAVs-UGVs Systems Against DoS Attacks,"The fixed-time cooperative control is investigated for heterogeneous multiagent systems (HMASs) containing multiple unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) and unmanned ground vehicles (UGVs) under Denial of Service (DoS) attacks and external perturbations. First, for the ease of collaborative tasks, an unified model is obtained in the XY plane by transforming the dynamical models of UAVs and UGVs. Then, a fuzzy switching observer is designed to achieve unavailable state estimation during the attack zone. In particular, in virtue of the character of DoS attacks, a novel fixed-time stability theory is set up. On this foundation, a distributed fixed-time secure tracking control strategy is raised by utilizing the adaptive approach to effectively defend against DoS attacks. Notably, distinct from the existing works on finite-time stability for HMASs, the present method exhibits some brilliant features, such as fast response, high accuracy, and attack resistance. Additionally, rational proofs have substantiated that the designed control scheme can not only ensure the boundedness of each closed-loop signal but also guarantee the synchronization error converges to a predefined small neighborhood near the origin in a fixed time. Ultimately, the validity of the proposed method is demonstrated by a representative simulation.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=10571363,"IEEE Transactions on Systems, Man, and Cybernetics: Systems",2024-01-01
A PUF and Fuzzy Extractor-Based UAV-Ground Station and UAV-UAV Authentication Mechanism With Intelligent Adaptation of Secure Sessions,"It is crucial that communication between an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) and the ground station (GS) be secure, and both devices should mutually authenticate each other to ensure that an adversary cannot obtain communicated information. Moreover, dynamically adapting the session time of an authenticated session can decrease the idle time of a session and consequently reduce the window of opportunity for an adversary to interfere with the communication link. In light of these considerations, we design a physically unclonable function (PUF) and fuzzy extractor-based UAV-GS authentication mechanism called UAV Authentication with Adaptive Session (UAAS). In UAAS, both UAV-GS and UAV-UAV authentication are two-way. We use a Thompson Sampling (TS)-based approach to intelligently adapt the duration of a session. Both formal and informal security proofs are presented along with a computation and communication cost analysis to analyze the performance of UAAS. It is noted that UAAS is secure against various well-known attacks and has a lower communication cost than several baseline mechanisms. Due to the noise reduction that occurs in PUFs, the computational cost of UAAS is higher than that of baselines that ignore noise. Also, our simulation shows that UAAS significantly outperforms baselines when it comes to network performance.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=10146461,IEEE Transactions on Mobile Computing,2024-01-01

Provably and Physically Secure UAV-Assisted Authentication Protocol for IoT Devices in Unattended Settings,"As the core subject of IoT applications, IoT devices have faced numerous security challenges. Especially for IoT devices deployed in remote or harsh environments, they are often unattended for long periods, making it difficult to share the sensing data and susceptible to potential physical attacks. While aerial assistance methods represented by unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) can solve the problem of data sharing at a low cost, it is necessary to establish a secure channel between ground control stations, UAVs, and IoT devices due to the sensitivity of the sensing data. Recently, Physical Unclonable Function (PUF) has been proven to provide unique identity identification for devices using its tamper-proof feature. In this paper, we propose a lightweight UAV-assisted authentication and key agreement protocol for unattended IoT devices, ensuring secure communication and physical tamper-proof requirements. However, our work does not stop there. We noticed that some existing PUF-based authentication schemes misunderstand the ability of PUF, which leads to these schemes cannot actually provide physical protection. We analyzed the security vulnerabilities of these schemes and proposed rules that should be followed when designing authentication protocols using PUF. In addition, for the first time, we put forward the formal definitions and proof methods for PUF in the formal proof of the security protocol, which avoided the unreasonable initial assumptions adopted in the proof of the existing schemes. We extended Mao-Boyd (MB) logic and comprehensively analyzed the proposed protocol. We also evaluate the performance of the proposed scheme, and the results show that the proposed scheme has certain advantages in communication and computation overhead compared with existing schemes.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=10476492,IEEE Transactions on Information Forensics and Security,2024-01-01

Secure Event-Triggered Sliding Control for Path Following of Autonomous Vehicles Under Sensor and Actuator Attacks,"Sensor and actuator attacks, which propagate the injected false data through CAN bus, make real threats to the security of the control of autonomous vehicles. This article attempts to solve the secure event-triggered path following control problem of autonomous vehicles subject to both sensor and actuator attacks. Firstly, a more general physical security model is established to characterize the impacts of sensor and actuator attacks on measurements and control actions. Then, feedback linearization method based on Lie derivative is exploited to linearize the established nonlinear attacked model. Thus, the nonlinear path following control is transformed into a linear case which will facilitate to the following networked-based analysis and design. Based on the established secure model, the event-triggered control scheme is utilized to alleviate communication burden under sampled-data control framework. Furthermore, the sliding control design is augmented to mitigate the malicious impacts caused by such false data injection attacks due to its inherent robustness to abnormal attack signal. Remarkably, the proposed secure sliding control can be plugged into the original control scheme rather than changing its existing control structure. Criteria for formal stability analysis and controller design are also provided and expressed in terms of some numerically tractable linear matrix inequalities.

Time-Series Anomaly Detection in Automated Vehicles Using D-CNN-LSTM Autoencoder,"It is reasonable to expect Connected and Automated Vehicles (CAVs) to revolutionize the intelligent world owing to the swapping of seamless and real-time data. Although CAVs provide many benefits to the environment and society, new challenges in term of security, privacy, and safety are emerged by anomalies, errors, cyber-security attacks, or malicious activities that led to accidents with fatal victims. This paper tackles the anomaly detection problem by introducing a novel framework in multi-sensor CAVs, which applies an efficient data preprocessing and deep learning method. In this paper, two preprocessing methods have been used and compared in the deep learning based models. The main contributions of this paper compared to previous works include two fundamental tasks. First, the quality of time series data is improved in the preprocessing phase by Differencing (DIFF) or Moving Standard Deviation (MSD). Second, the applied deep learning method is based on an autoencoder where a combination of Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) is utilized as the autoencoder architecture, which is referred to as D-CNN-LSTM Autoencoder in this paper. The D-CNN-LSTM Autoencoder method optimizes the anomaly detection rate for all of the anomalies, specifically in the case of low magnitude anomalies, enhancing F1-score up to 18.12% in single types of anomalies and 32.83% in mixed types of anomalies. The experimental results indicate the superiority of the proposed method for time series anomaly detection over the state-of-the-art and benchmark methods.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85189551719&origin=inward,IEEE Transactions on Intelligent Transportation Systems,2024-01-01
Fusion-Based Event-Triggered Hâ State Estimation of Networked Autonomous Surface Vehicles With Measurement Outliers and Cyber-Attacks,"This paper investigates the fusion-based event-triggered  $H_{\infty} $  state estimation of autonomous surface vehicles (ASVs) against measurement outliers and cyber-attacks. To release communication burden, a novel fusion-based event-triggered mechanism (FETM) dependent on the fusion of historical system outputs is proposed. There exist two advantages of this mechanism: 1) the use of fusion signal is able to avoid the information loss between two sampling instants and reduce the redundant triggering events resulted from system disturbances and noises; 2) by requiring the error signal in the triggering condition not only lager than a lower threshold but also less than an upper threshold, the false triggering events incurred by measurement outliers also can be discarded. Then, a time-varying delay system is established to represent the event-triggered  $H_{\infty} $  state estimation error system with network-induced delays. Then, sufficient conditions are deduced for solving  $H_{\infty }$  estimator gain and triggering matrix of FETM.

Complicated sensor and actuator faults in the physical layer and aperiodic denial-of-service (DoS) attacks in the cyber layer are modeled, respectively. Decentralized fault-estimation unknown input observers and event-triggered distributed anti-DoS-attack fault-tolerant consensus controllers are devised in a co-designed framework, thus maintaining not only the tolerance and resilience of platoon consensus errors and estimation errors but also the secure vehicle avoidance spacing by virtue of attack frequency and average dwelling time indicators. Simulations and experiments validate the distributed control algorithm in the pernicious short-cycle and long-cycle DoS attack scenarios.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=10540266,IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology,2024-01-01
"A Mechanism to Localize, Detect, and Prevent Jamming in Connected and Autonomous Vehicles (CAVs)","One of the challenges in Connected and Autonomous Vehicles (CAVs) and Vehicular Ad Hoc Networks (VANETs) is jamming attacks. These attacks present safety concerns and may render the whole communication network ineffective. Designing an anti-jamming solution for CAVs and VANETs is non-trivial because every jamming scenario presents itself with unique characteristics. In this paper, we extend our previous work in Alam (2021) by proposing a scheme that localizes jamming vehicles, maps the jammed area, and prevents the jamming vehicles from sending and/or receiving beacons in the network. To achieve these objectives, we apply Centroid Localization (CL), Graham Scan Hull Algorithm (GSHA), and bloom filter data structure. The novelties of our work are three-fold. 1) We dynamically change the X, Y positions and radii of the jamming vehicles. 2) We implement multiple jamming attack scenarios with multiple jammers and varying number of vehicles. 3) We prevent the jamming vehicles from sending messages in the network. Simulation results show that on average, our model achieves an accuracy of 97.77%, a precision of 99.14%, a recall of 93.54%, and an F1 score of 96.03% for all the attack scenarios implemented.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=10260286,IEEE Transactions on Intelligent Transportation Systems,2024-01-01

Non-Intrusive Security Assessment Methods for Future Autonomous Transportation IoV,"The security of the Internet of Vehicles (IoV) has always been a concern. The constantly changing IoV data under varying traffic conditions made it unsuitable for the IoV to adopt traditional anti-attack techniques. In the absence of protections, attackers can use in-car communication as a target to compromise the safety of passengers, hence the instancy to detect the security state of the IoV. However, currently available solutions require modifications to the original hardware of the IoV and are therefore very limited in applicability. In this paper, we propose a security assessment method for IoV based on Microcontroller Unit (MCU) chip temperature, called SAMCT. Specifically, we first record the MCU chip temperatures of IoV device in different security states and analyze the relationship between them. Second, the fingerprint dataset is built using the temperature residuals. Third, to forecast the security standing of IoV devices, an integration regression model based on Self-Encoders is suggested. Lastly, in order to facilitate the effectiveness of the SAMCT, a Cloud-Edge-End framework is designed with the technology of model adaptive partitioning. Results from the experiments, which were carried out on the Raspberry Pi 4B and Stm32 hardware platforms, demonstrate that the Mean Squared Error (MSE) of the SAMCT is only 0.00104 and that the execution efficiency improvement under the Cloud-Edge-End framework is significant. Note to PractitionersâThis paper was inspired by security concerns in Internet of Vehicles communication systems. The core of this work is to provide a novel security assessment method for IoV devices based on MCU temperature, which can detect the security status of IoV devices in real-time without modifying the original hardware. To this end, the different skills from scheme design to detection and validation are explained. One crucial part of this work is to regard the MCU temperature of the IoV device as a security reference and fully integrate the critical techniques in deep learning. In addition, the proposed scheme is universal and can be applied to various scenarios such as the autonomous driving and the industrial internet of things.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85173375040&origin=inward,IEEE Transactions on Automation Science and Engineering,2024-01-01

Malicious Data Traceability and Throughput Optimization Using Blockchain (IOTA Smart Contracts) for Next Generation Internet of Vehicles,"The Internet of Vehicles (IoV) faces security threats from malicious entities that endanger vehicles. However, traditional centralized networks have limitations in scalability, latency, and security. Decentralized blockchain architectures provide an alternative, though conventional blockchains also have restrictions. We develop an architecture based on IOTA's Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) ledger tailored to IoV needs to enhance traceability, throughput, and security. The goal is to leverage IOTA's decentralized, high throughput, low latency design to overcome limitations in existing IoV networks. We propose an IOTA-based model using smart contracts for malicious data/user tracing and timing side-channels for attack detection. We adaptively schedule data to optimize throughput based on traffic conditions. Our simulations compare throughput, latency, and attack detection across varied scenarios. Our results demonstrate that the architecture enables automated security via decentralized consensus, avoiding centralized failures. The smart contracts facilitate real-time threat tracing and mitigation. Timing analysis reveals IOTA's ability to identify attacks through latency fluctuations. Optimized data transfer scheduling adapts to congestion levels. Overall, integrating reputation systems, smart contracts, and IOTA's innovations significantly improves security, efficiency, and scalability compared to centralized and blockchain IoV networks. This work advances IoV security by outlining a comprehensive blockchain solution leveraging IOTA's unique capabilities. The decentralized mechanisms enhance traceability and trust while optimizing performance tailored to vehicular demands. This establishes a foundation for reliable and safe autonomous driving through innovations in distributed ledger technology.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85201297321&origin=inward,IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology,2024-01-01
Area Surveillance With Low Detection Probability Using UAV Swarms,"Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) deployed as a swarm can offer a flexible and cost-efficient solution for surveillance missions in large-scale adversarial environments. UAV swarms possess superior real-time surveillance capabilities in detecting time-sensitive targets with speed and security, surpassing alternative techniques such as satellites and ground-based sensors. However, the area surveillance problem in adversarial scenarios using UAV swarms necessitates careful consideration of factors such as swarm positioning, flight attitudes, antenna directionality, the threat posed by adversary detection systems (ADSs), and swarm network topology. To address this challenge, we propose the Integrated Low Detection Probability (ILDP) deployment method for UAV swarms, which incorporates the Danger Avoidance Distributed Motion control algorithm (DADM) for swarm collaboration and the Low Detection Probability Topology Control algorithm (LDPTC) for swarm networking. The DADM algorithm facilitates swarm cooperation in achieving area coverage and evading ADSs by leveraging neighboring, environmental, and threat information in adversarial scenarios. Furthermore, the LDPTC algorithm establishes a topology optimization model that comprehensively considers swarm distribution and the impact of directional antenna sidelobes to reduce transmitting energy leakage on the ground. Our strategy significantly decreases the detection probability of UAV swarms by ADSs, ensuring the operational effectiveness of UAV swarms in dynamic adversarial scenarios. Extensive simulations validate the superiority of our proposed ILDP method, demonstrating considerably lower detection probabilities compared to other approaches in static and dynamic adversary environments across various swarm scales. Moreover, our method excels in real-time surveillance capabilities with lower computational complexity, freeing up computing resources for UAVs to fulfill additional tasks.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=10267876,IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology,2024-01-01

An efficient privacy-preserved authentication technique based on conformable fractional chaotic map for TMIS under smart homes environments,"People with special needs can receive health care services in their own homes through the use of smart home systems. In essence, this type of smart home has specialized electronics that allow remote operation of automated remote health care gadgets, enabling patient security and health tracking. These sensors are linked to a local intelligence unit, which examines sensor data, detects emergencies, and serves as the patientâs point of contact with various healthcare professionals such as doctors, paramedics, nurses, and emergency services. Smart homes can improve the patientâs quality of life and security by creatively utilizing cutting-edge technologies. The use of smart homes is being driven by telemedicine and telecare. Telecare Medicine Information Systems (TMIS) were developed 20&nbsp;years ago and have increased in popularity on a global scale since then as current technology has enabled healthcare to be delivered remotely. Using upgraded network technologies, a new technological platform for TMIS for patients is provided. TMIS, on the other hand, is commonly targeted by various forms of attacks due to data transmission across an insecure channel. Several authentication techniques based on the chaotic map have recently been proposed. Many of these designs, however, are not resistant to the known attacks. Although some of the structures achieve low computation overhead, many of them are unable to guarantee forward secrecy and cannot establish an anonymous conversation. In order to improve security and efficiency, we provide an authentication and key agreement mechanism for TMIS in smart city environments in this study. Fractional chaotic theory assumptions underlie the security assumptions. With just two messages exchanged, a secure session can be started using this approach, which enables forward secrecy. In addition, we compare and contrast related authentication techniques.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85168163267&origin=inward,The Journal of Supercomputing,2024-01-01

SOS-FCI: a secure offloading scheme in fogâcloud-based IoT,"The Internet of Things (IoT) is growing and has significantly impacted today's life. Although the IoT plays an essential role in human life, it has processing limitations, and this has caused it to not perform well in the face of extensive processing. To solve this limitation in the IoT, the offloading technique is used. Due to the nature of wireless networks, which are constantly at risk of active and passive attacks, a third party can attack an IoT device when it wants to send a process to another device for offloading. We use SOS-FCI, a secure mutual authentication scheme for secure offloading using elliptic-curve cryptography, to solve this problem. The SOS-FCI scheme has been formally evaluated through the Automated Validation of Internet Security Protocols and Applications tool and informally. Formal and informal security evaluation results show that the SOS-FCI scheme resists active and passive attacks. The SOS-FCI scheme has been assessed regarding computational and communication costs and security features with a similar scheme. The results show that the security features of the SOS-FCI scheme are superior to a similar scheme, and it has a high-cost ratio in terms of computational and communication costs. We simulated the SOS-FCI scheme with the NS3 tool. The simulation results in different modes show that packet loss, packet delivery, throughput, and end-to-end delay increase as the number of devices increases.",https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007/s11227-023-05499-3.pdf,The Journal of Supercomputing,2024-01-01

B-UAVM: A Blockchain-Supported Secure Multi-UAV Task Management Scheme,"The advent of unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) swarm technology brings possibilities to help humans complete tasks in no manâs land, such as deserts and rainforests. However, UAV network faces many cyber threats, where attackers can impersonate legitimate entities or tamper with UAV task data. For identity security, most of the existing methods use centralized authentication schemes, which have a single point of failure problem. For data security, the existing methods only secure the task data in the ground system, ignoring the data security in the air network. Therefore, the existing methods are not suitable for ubiquitous UAV scenarios. Blockchain secures data security while eliminating the single point of failure problem, and has been widely used in distributed scenarios. In this article, to secure entity identity and task data, we propose a blockchain-supported secure multi-UAV task management scheme (B-UAVM). Specifically, a three-layer blockchain structure is constructed to secure multitasks, and achieve ubiquitous control of UAV formations. Besides, six types of blocks and three types of transactions are designed to achieve safe processing and storage of task data and entity information. Furthermore, an improved practical byzantine fault tolerance (IPBFT) consensus mechanism and a UAV-formation-action-considered ground station consensus mechanism (UFAGS) are introduced in the Server Network and Ground Control Network, respectively, to accelerate the consensus. The experimental results show that the number of transactions generated per second (TPS) of B-UAVM is about  $0.5\times $  and  $3.7\times $  of the existing method when the block size or the number of blockchain nodes increases, respectively.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85161085219&origin=inward,IEEE Internet of Things Journal,2023-12-15

IRS-Assisted Anti-Jamming Transmission for an Integrated Satellite-UAV-Terrestrial Network With Imperfect CSI: A Game-Based Perspective,"In this article, an intelligent reflecting surface (IRS)-assisted integrated satellite-unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV)-terrestrial (SUT) Internet of Things (IoT) network faced with a smart jammer under imperfect channel state information (CSI) conditions is considered. We propose a Stackelberg game model to describe the adversarial relationship between the satellite, UAV, and IRS and the jammer, which are modeled as the leader and the follower, respectively. For the follower subgame, the jammer aims to minimize the jamming power while guaranteeing that the jamming energy efficiency surpasses a certain threshold. Under this setup, the Angle of Arrival (AoA)-based discretization method is utilized to address the imperfect CSI issue. Then, the use-and-then-forget method and the Lagrangian function are employed to obtain a closed-form expression for the jammerâs power. Finally, a feasible jamming power solution is obtained by means of the CauchyâSchwarz inequality. For the leader subgame, we aim to optimize the hybrid beamforming design of the satellite, UAV and IRS, with the goal of minimizing the total transmit power, while guaranteeing that the downlink received signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR) surpasses the minimum communication threshold. We propose an alternating optimization scheme, in which the CauchyâSchwarz inequality, the AoA-based discretization method, and nonsmooth penalty functions are employed to alternately obtain the optimal satellite beamforming vector, UAV beamforming vector and IRS phase matrix when the other variables are fixed. Through our analytical and numerical results, the proposed beamforming scheme achieves a reduction of 16.9% in average power consumption compared with other benchmark schemes when obtaining the same anti-jamming performance.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=10149096,IEEE Internet of Things Journal,2023-12-01

Optimization of a Secure UAV-Based IoT: RF-Fingerprint Authentication and Resource Allocation,"Unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) technology has been developed to establish a mobile-edge computing (MEC) network for the Internet of Things (IoT). In the MEC network, users can reduce their latency by communicating and exchanging data with UAV-based edge servers. Security is a critical issue in a UAV-based IoT since the attackers who attempt to access the network may cause interference and influence the flight of the UAV. In this article, we propose a lightweight RF fingerprinting recognition method in consideration of the limited computing power in UAVs, identifying unauthenticated attackers and refusing their access to IoT. Also, we propose a resource allocation scheme in the secure UAV-based MEC network. By establishing a nonconvex resource optimization problem and decomposing it into a few tractable subproblems, we offer a numerical algorithm for the optimum resource allocation. The analysis results illustrate that our proposed method can reduce energy consumption and running time compared to its benchmark methods.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=10138659,IEEE Internet of Things Journal,2023-11-01
Smart Optimization Solution for Channel Access Attack Defense Under UAV-Aided Heterogeneous Network,"6G-based wireless communication system is poised to redefine the next-generation network landscape by enabling novel services and applications, such as intelligent link establishment, power control, data collection, transmission, and distribution. However, security issues, particularly recently revealed channel access attack (CAA), present significant challenges to performance optimization tasks in the heterogeneous wireless networks of 6G, namely, Age of Information (AoI) oriented Network (AoN), Throughput oriented Network (ToN), and Latency oriented Network (LoN). To address these challenges, this article presents a game theory-based smart optimization solution to enable unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV) to resist CAA within a 6G-based heterogeneous network. Our methodology begins by outlining the advantages and challenges associated with UAV usage, followed by the design of performance indicators and intelligent resource allocation schemes under the influence of CAA. Subsequently, we introduce definitions and categories within game theory, encompassing the concept and equilibrium of three typical game models. The efficacy of our proposed framework is validated through simulation results, which demonstrate the achievement of optimal AoI, enhanced throughput, and reduced latency compared with baseline methodologies when countering CAA in a UAV-assisted heterogeneous network.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85161584577&origin=inward,IEEE Internet of Things Journal,2023-11-01

Î¼Tesla-Based Authentication for Reliable and Secure Broadcast Communications in IoD Using Blockchain,"The Internet of Drones (IoD) manages and coordinates communications between drones in Internet of Things (IoT) applications. Ensuring security and privacy in unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) networks, i.e., drones, is essential to protect data from cyber attacks. In this context, providing authentication is a major challenge due to the fact that drones are devices limited in power capabilities. The problem is aggravated by the dynamism of IoD networks due to the high mobility of drones, being sensitive to packet loss and handovers. Blockchain technology is attractive to address the problem of centralization of existing authentication protocols. In this article, we provide a decentralized, secure, and efficient authentication protocol, based on  $\mu $ Tesla, that relies on Blockchain to manage drone authentication. We analyze the security and performance of the proposed solution. Simulation results show that the proposed solution outperforms several approaches in the literature, achieving an authentication delay of less than 250 ms with a low information exchange of 1024 bits for 128-bit security level while maintaining low computational requirements.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85161060112&origin=inward,IEEE Internet of Things Journal,2023-10-15

An efficient certificateless group signcryption scheme using Quantum Chebyshev Chaotic Maps in HC-IoT environments,"Signcryption is a highly efficient approach to simultaneously achieving message confidentiality and authentication in Human-Centered IoT (HC-IoT) systems. HCIoT is a new field of study that links various aspects of life such as smart cards, business, e-commerce, healthcare, and sensitive private data. A number of intelligent systems favor human intervention to start automated tasks. A number of smart devices have a social effect in that they should be capable of changing their functional model based on the behavior of different humans. It has boosted the development of information exchange over the IoT and enabled networks. It encompasses cellular, vehicular, and human healthcare by utilizing middleware. Currently, group signcryption schemes are gaining widespread popularity in HC-IoT environments. HC-IoT is useful in electronic cash systems, lightweight devices, multi-server networks, and more. However, most signcryption schemes use bilinear pairing that is computationally intensive, and there is a need for more efficient signcryption schemes. In order to solve this issue, this paper introduces an efficient Certificateless Group-oriented Signcryption (CGS) scheme using Quantum Chebyshev Chaotic Maps (QCCM) without employing bilinear pairing. The proposed QCCM-CGS schemeâs standout feature is that any group signcrypter can signcrypt a text/information with the group manager (GM) and then present it to the verifier for verification. By using the public conditions of the group, the verifier approves the validity of the signcrypted text and cannot connect the signcrypted text to the conforming signcrypter. However, a legitimate signcrypted text cannot be generated even by the GM or any signcrypter of that group unaccompanied. In situations where there is a legal disagreement, such as non-repudiation of the signature, the GM can reveal the identity of the signcrypter. The presented scheme is adequately secured from the indistinguishably chosen ciphertext attack. The computationally challenging problem, QCCM, is used as the foundation for the construction of traceability, unforgeability, unlinkability, and security. Lastly, the security review of the projected scheme clearly shows significant consistency, and it can be easily deployed in vulnerable security applications.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85157994298&origin=inward,The Journal of Supercomputing,2023-10-01

Trustworthy Sensor Fusion Against Inaudible Command Attacks in Advanced Driver-Assistance Systems,"There are increasing concerns about malicious attacks on autonomous vehicles. In particular, inaudible voice command attacks pose a significant threat as voice commands become available in autonomous driving systems. How to empirically defend against these inaudible attacks remains an open question. Previous research investigates utilizing deep learning-based multimodal fusion for defense, without considering the model uncertainty in trustworthiness. As deep learning has been applied to increasingly sensitive tasks, uncertainty measurement is crucial in helping improve model robustness, especially in mission-critical scenarios. In this article, we propose the multimodal fusion framework (MFF) as an intelligent security system to defend against inaudible voice command attacks. MFF fuses heterogeneous audioâvision modalities using VGG family neural networks and achieves the detection accuracy of 92.25% in the comparative fusion method empirical study. Additionally, extensive experiments on audioâvision tasks reveal the modelâs uncertainty. Using expected calibration errors, we measure calibration errors and Monte Carlo Dropout to estimate the predictive distribution for the proposed models. Our findings show empirically to train robust multimodal models, improve standard accuracy and provide a further step toward interpretability. Finally, we discuss the pros and cons of our approach and its applicability for advanced driver assistance systems.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85160261352&origin=inward,IEEE Internet of Things Journal,2023-10-01
DeepManeuver: Adversarial Test Generation for Trajectory Manipulation of Autonomous Vehicles,"Adversarial test generation techniques aim to produce input perturbations that cause a DNN to compute incorrect outputs. For autonomous vehicles driven by a DNN, however, the effect of such perturbations are attenuated by other parts of the system and are less effective as vehicle state evolves. In this work we argue that for adversarial testing perturbations to be effective on autonomous vehicles, they must account for the subtle interplay between the DNN and vehicle states. Building on that insight, we develop DeepManeuver, an automated framework that interleaves adversarial test generation with vehicle trajectory physics simulation. Thus, as the vehicle moves along a trajectory, DeepManeuver enables the refinement of candidate perturbations to: (1) account for changes in the state of the vehicle that may affect how the perturbation is perceived by the system; (2) retain the effect of the perturbation on previous states so that the current state is still reachable and past trajectory is preserved; and (3) result in multi-target maneuvers that require fulfillment of vehicle state sequences (e.g. reaching locations in a road to navigate a tight turn). Our assessment reveals that DeepManeuver can generate perturbations to force maneuvers more effectively and consistently than state-of-the-art techniques by 20.7 percentage points on average. We also show DeepManeuver's effectiveness at disrupting vehicle behavior to achieve multi-target maneuvers with a minimum 52% rate of success.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=10213222,IEEE Transactions on Software Engineering,2023-10-01

Sybil Attack Detection in Internet of Flying Things-IoFT: A Machine Learning Approach,"Sybil attack refers to the situation when a malicious node falsely claims to have numerous identities and is known to be one of the security threats to the Internet of Things (IoT). Due to recent increase usage of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) in various applications, Sybil attack has been identified as a threat to the flying ad hoc network (FANET) paradigm and its integration with the IoT to form the Internet of Flying Things (IoFT). In this article, we propose an intelligent Sybil attack detection approach for FANETs-based IoFT using physical layer characteristics of the radio signals emitted from the UAVs as detected by two ground nodes. A supervised machine learning approach is employed and experimented with several different classifiers available in the Weka workbench platform. The experiment was carried out based on two features of the radio signals, namely, the received signal strength difference (RSSD) and the Time Difference of Arrival (TDoA). Simulation results revealed that the proposed scheme can achieve a high correct classification accuracy of above 91% on average, even for smart malicious nodes with power control capability operating at power levels not directly trained. In addition to its high performance, the proposed scheme is also less susceptible to various attacks commonly carried out on the upper layers, such as data spoofing, due to the use of only intrinsically generated physical layer data. Furthermore, no additional communications overheads of the UAV nodes are required for the functionality of this scheme.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85151499804&origin=inward,IEEE Internet of Things Journal,2023-07-15

A lightweight certificate-based authentication scheme for 6LoWPAN-based internet of things,"As the 6LoWPAN devices in the Internet of Things (IoT) applications communicate sensitive information over the unattended and insecure channel, it is essential to design suitable authentication methods for such devices. Due to high computation and communication overheads, the traditional certificate-based authentication schemes are predominantly considered impractical for resource-constraint 6LoWPAN devices used in IoT applications. However, a certificate with some lightweight features makes the authentication feasible in those resource-constraint 6LoWPAN devices. This paper proposes a lightweight certificate-based authentication scheme based on cryptographic hash operation and elliptic curve digital signature algorithm. It can mitigate several security threats, including replay, man-in-the-middle, impersonation, malicious device deployment, and spoofing attacks. The automated validation of Internet security protocols and applications (AVISPA) verification tool is used to formally verify the security of the proposed scheme against several known attacks. In addition, the correctness of the authentication scheme is verified using the widely accepted BAN logic. Moreover, a comparative analysis among the proposed and other well-established relevant schemes is carried out in order to figure out the trade-off considering not only the functionality attributes and security but also the involved computation and communication costs.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85149892483&origin=inward,The Journal of Supercomputing,2023-07-01

AUV-Assisted Stratified Source Location Privacy Protection Scheme Based on Network Coding in UASNs,"The position of the source is sensitive and critical information in underwater acoustic sensor networks (UASNs). In this study, a network coding-based scheme called the stratified source location privacy protection scheme (SSLP-NC) with autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV) is suggested for a strong adversary that can decode data. First, for the adversary with passive attacks, several fake source selection algorithms are suggested for two circumstances where the source is in the shallow and deep sea, respectively. Each node then utilizes a pseudo-random number generator to create sequences on a regular basis so that the key data can be delivered to the sink without interference. Then, for the adversary with the active attack, the node encrypts the source and fake data using the pre-existing pseudo-random number sequence as an encoding vector to thwart the adversaryâs decryption. Further, this work develops a relay node selection approach for transmitting the encoded data, which increases the variety of the data transmission pathways. Finally, this study includes a hole avoidance strategy that uses nodes or an AUV to address the potential hole issue. The simulation demonstrates that the SSLP-NC successfully fends off an adversary that can decode data packets, and performs better than the EECOR and DBR-MAC algorithms in terms of network safe time and packet delivery rate.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=10026869,IEEE Internet of Things Journal,2023-06-15

Pistis: Replay Attack and Liveness Detection for Gait-Based User Authentication System on Wearable Devices Using Vibration,"Wearable devices-based biometrics has become mainstream in the biometric domain, especially in mobile computing, due to its convenience, flexibility, and potentially high user acceptance. Among various modalities, wearable devices-based gait recognition has been recognized as an effective user authentication method and employed in various applications, such as automated entry systems for home, school, work, vehicles, and automated ticket payment/validation for public transport. However, how secure wearable gait remains an open research question. In this study, we conduct a comprehensive security analysis of the wearable gait. Then, we demonstrate that gait itself is not robust against some attacking methods, such as spoofing or forgery. Therefore, we argue that an anti-spoofing mechanism is important for enhancing the security of wearable gait biometric systems. To this end, we proposed a novel authentication protocol called  $Pistis$  that embedded gait biometrics and a liveness detection mechanism that is aiming to detect various attacks of gait authentication systems. Our extensive experiments based on 50 subjects demonstrate that  $Pistis$  is effective in liveness detection and authentication performance enhancement, providing 100% accuracy for human and nonhuman detection, and 99.53% accuracy for user authentication. Pistis can be used as a liveness detection method for wearable devices-based biometrics, significantly for wearable gait.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85146255754&origin=inward,IEEE Internet of Things Journal,2023-05-01
L-GAN: landmark-based generative adversarial network for efficient face de-identification,"A large amount of high-quality data are collected through autonomous vehicles, CCTVs, guidance service robots, and web map services (Google Street View). However, the data collected through them include personal information such as peoplesâ faces and vehicle license plates. Currently, personal information contained in data is de-identified using methods such as face blur, pixelation, and masking. Consequently, it loses value as data for artificial intelligence (AI) learning. Therefore, in this study, we propose a model to generate a fake face that maintains the basic structure of the human face. There are several methods for generating faces. One is to generate them using a generative adversarial network (GAN) model. The GAN is an AI algorithm used for unsupervised learning and is implemented by a system in which two neural networks compete. However, because GAN operates as an input of a random noise vector, it is difficult to obtain results for the desired face angle and shape. Therefore, pre- and post-processing is required to generate a fake face that maintains the basic structure and angles; however, the calculation is complicated, and it is difficult to generate a natural image. To solve this problem, we propose a method for generating a fake face that maintains the basic structure and angle of the real face by applying a facial landmark. Using the proposed method, it was possible to generate a fake face with a different impression while maintaining the basic structure and angle of the face.",https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007/s11227-022-04954-x.pdf,The Journal of Supercomputing,2023-05-01

An anonymous and authenticated V2I communication with a simplified user revocation and re-registration strategy,"Vehicle-to-Infrastructure (V2I) communication is the key requirement in various applications of Vehicular Ad-hoc Network (VANET). However, due to the use of unguided media, V2I communication may suffer from threat to security, privacy, and application data confidentiality. Besides, user revocation and re-registration also play important roles to manage the subscriberâs service validity. Recently, many protocols have been discussed to secure V2I communication. Unfortunately, none could fulfill the desired goals. Additionally, most of the existing protocols does not address user revocation and re-registration. In this paper, we propose an anonymous and authenticated V2I communication with a simplified user revocation and re-registration strategy. The security of the protocol under attacks (passive/active) is ensured using hash-based security and Elliptic Curve Discrete Logarithmic Problem&nbsp;(ECDLP). We discuss a simplified approach for user revocation and re-registration which relaxes the use of a separate revocation list. Additionally, our protocol concentrates on the anonymity of roadside units. We present both formal and informal security analysis to prove the robustness of the protocol under security attacks. The formal&nbsp;security analysis is done based on eavesdropping, forward/backward secrecy, and many other active attacks (e.g., ESL attack, password guessing attack, etc.), whereas the informal security analysis is done based on various security and privacy parameters such as privacy of VU and RSU, forward/backward secrecy, conditional privacy, and many other active/passive attacks. Besides, we employ AVISPA tool-based automated simulation to ensure the security under replay, man-in-the-middle, and impersonation attacks. The performance analysis section illustrates that our protocol preserves increased security and privacy factors than other similar protocols.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85143763303&origin=inward,The Journal of Supercomputing,2023-05-01

Unmanned Aerial Vehicle as Encryption Key Distributor for Secure Communications in Smart Grid,"We use symmetric cryptography for secure communications with resource-limited smart grid control devices. We propose the novel idea of using the unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) as a physical courier to carry secret key bits generated at the control center to remote control devices. While distributing secret keys, the UAV may be attacked in an attempt to sabotage secure communications. The UAV may fly a longer route to avoid attackers but it has a limited onboard battery capacity and must visit each device within a time limit to prevent a secret key deficit. We formulate an optimization to find the lowest attack risk flight route for secret key distribution while taking into consideration key deficiency and battery capacity. Such optimization is NP-hard. We further propose an efficient algorithm to find a low-risk flight route in less than a second, even for a large power grid system with more than a hundred nodes. For large systems, we modify the proposed algorithm to find a low-risk flight route as well as to determine the required UAV flight duration and battery size. Extensive simulation results confirm the superiority of the proposed algorithm against a baseline scheme that is ignorant of attackers.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85152908722&origin=inward,IEEE Internet of Things Journal,2023-04-15

A Triggerless Backdoor Attack and Defense Mechanism for Intelligent Task Offloading in Multi-UAV Systems,"In recent years, multiunmanned aerial vehicular systems (MUAVs) have become prevalent in divergent applications: agriculture, spectrum utilization, transportation, forest fire monitoring, and among others, due to their flexible, robust, and autonomous operational maneuver. Battery-powered multiunmanned aerial vehicles (MUAVs) systems possess limited computation and communication resources, significantly reducing their functional dimension by limiting mission time and range. To address this issue, we propose a federated deep reinforcement learning (FDRL)-based intelligent and decentralized task offloading scheme for resource-constrained UAVs that can enhance the operational capability of the MUAV systems. Moreover, the proposed FDRL scheme can improve offloading policy quality while preserving data privacy in MUAV. However, such intelligent systems may fall prey to backdoor attacks that can intervene in the systemâs regular operation causing rapid degradation of its performance. We introduce a novel triggerless backdoor attack scheme on intelligent task offloading UAVs and analyze its impact to gauge the resiliency of the offloading policy in the presence of an adversary. Then, we propose lightweight agnostic defense mechanisms to combat such backdoors in multi-UAV settings. The extensive simulation results show that the proposed attack and defense strategies are practical and efficient.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85132533980&origin=inward,IEEE Internet of Things Journal,2023-04-01
Mind the Gap! A Study on the Transferability of Virtual Versus Physical-World Testing of Autonomous Driving Systems,"Safe deployment of self-driving cars (SDC) necessitates thorough simulated and in-field testing. Most testing techniques consider virtualized SDCs within a simulation environment, whereas less effort has been directed towards assessing whether such techniques transfer to and are effective with a physical real-world vehicle. In this paper, we shed light on the problem of generalizing testing results obtained in a driving simulator to a physical platform and provide a characterization and quantification of the sim2real gap affecting SDC testing. In our empirical study, we compare SDC testing when deployed on a physical small-scale vehicle versus its digital twin. Due to the unavailability of driving quality indicators from the physical platform, we use neural rendering to estimate them through visual odometry, hence allowing full comparability with the digital twin. Then, we investigate the transferability of behavior and failure exposure between virtual and real-world environments, targeting both unintended abnormal test data and intended adversarial examples. Our study shows that, despite the usage of a faithful digital twin, there are still critical shortcomings that contribute to the reality gap between the virtual and physical world, threatening existing testing solutions that only consider virtual SDCs. On the positive side, our results present the test configurations for which physical testing can be avoided, either because their outcome does transfer between virtual and physical environments, or because the uncertainty profiles in the simulator can help predict their outcome in the real world.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9869302,IEEE Transactions on Software Engineering,2023-04-01

Dynamic UAV Deployment for Differentiated Services: A Multi-Agent Imitation Learning Based Approach,"Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) have been utilized to serve on-ground users with various services, e.g., computing, communication and caching, due to their mobility and flexibility. The main focus of many recent studies on UAVs is to deploy a set of homogeneous UAVs with identical capabilities controlled by one UAV owner/company to provide services. However, little attention has been paid to the issue of how to enable different UAV owners to provide services with differentiated service capabilities in a shared area. To address this issue, we propose a multi-agent imitation learning enabled UAV deployment approach to maximize both profits of UAV owners and utilities of on-ground users. Specially, a Markov game is formulated among UAV owners and we prove that a Nash equilibrium exists based on the full knowledge of the system. For online scheduling with incomplete information, we design agent policies by imitating the behaviors of corresponding experts. A novel neural network model, integrating convolutional neural networks, generative adversarial networks and a gradient-based policy, can be trained and executed in a fully decentralized manner with a guaranteed $\epsilon$Îµ-Nash equilibrium. Performance results show that our algorithm has significant superiority in terms of average profits, utilities and execution time compared with other representative algorithms.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85118673567&origin=inward,IEEE Transactions on Mobile Computing,2023-04-01

Flying Among Stars: Jamming-Resilient Channel Selection for UAVs Through Aerial Constellations,"Wireless communication between an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) and the ground base station is susceptible to adversarial jamming. In such situations, it is important for the UAV to indicate a new channel to the BS. This paper describes a method of creating spatial codes that map the chosen channel to the location of the UAVs in space, wherein the latter physically traverses the space from a given so called âconstellation pointsâ to another. These points create patterns in the sky, analogous to modulation constellations in classical wireless communications, and are detected at the BS through a millimeter-wave radar sensor. A constellation point represents a distinct n-bit field mapped to a specific channel, allowing simultaneous frequency switching at both ends without any RF transmissions. The main contributions of this paper are: (i) We conduct experimental studies to demonstrate how such constellations may be formed using COTS UAVs and mmWave sensors, (ii) We develop a theoretical framework that maps a desired constellation design to error and band switching time, including multi-user scenario-specific challenges, (iii) We compare our approach against current FHSS technology and (iv) We experimentally demonstrate jamming resilient communications and validate system goodput for links formed by UAV-mounted software defined radios.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9508187,IEEE Transactions on Mobile Computing,2023-03-01
PPCA - Privacy-Preserving Collision Avoidance for Autonomous Unmanned Aerial Vehicles,"Current collision avoidance techniques deployed on Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) rely on short-range sensors, such as proximity sensors, cameras, and microphones. Unfortunately, their efficiency is significantly limited in several situations; for instance, when a remote UAV approaches at high velocity, or when the surrounding environment is impaired (e.g., fog, noise). In the cited cases, to avoid collisions and maintain self-separation, UAVs often rely on the indiscriminate broadcast of their location. Therefore, an adversary could easily identify the location of the UAV and attack it, e.g., by physically shutting it down, launching wireless jamming attacks, or continuing tracking its movements. To address the above-introduced threats, in this article we present PPCA, a lightweight, distributed, and privacy-preserving scheme to avoid collisions among UAVs. Our solution, based on an ingenious tessellation of the space, is accompanied by a thorough analytical model and is supported by an extensive experimental campaign performed on a real 3DR-Solo drone. The achieved results are striking: PPCA can efficiently and effectively avoid collisions among UAVs, by requiring a limited bandwidth and computational overhead (84.85% less than traditional privacy-preserving proximity testing approaches), while providing unique benefits in terms of privacy of the participating UAVs.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85126558575&origin=inward,IEEE Transactions on Dependable and Secure Computing,2023-03-01

AD-RCNN: Adaptive Dynamic Neural Network for Small Object Detection,"With the large-scale commercialization of 5G networks, Internet of Things (IoT) applications keep on emerging in recent years. Real-time environmental awareness is an essential part of various IoT applications, e.g., self-driving vehicles. Object detection plays a fundamental role in real-time environmental awareness, which is responsible for acquiring valuable object information from the environment automatically. Despite of the fast progress for object detection in general, small object detection still faces challenges. Because of the restricted scales, small objects are only capable of generating relatively week features after multiple convolutional layers, thus causing low detection accuracy. Existing schemes mostly focus on extracting rich multiscale features, e.g., generating high-resolution features through generative adversarial networks (GANs), or generating multiscale features through feature combination. Nevertheless, these schemes require complex network implementation, and usually suffer from high processing delay because of high-resolution images. To resolve the problems mentioned above, we propose an adaptive dynamic neural network (AD-RCNN) that consists of three fundamental improvements. We first propose a dynamic region proposal network to improve the quality of region proposals. We then introduce a visual attention scheme to generate features of regions. Finally, we put forward an adaptive dynamic training module to optimize final detection results. Experimental results demonstrate that AD-RCNN outperforms the state-of-the-art from the perspectives of mAP and frames per second (FPS). Specifically, at the resolution of 1024 of TT100K data set, AD-RCNN achieves 68.8% mAP, which outperforms the baseline Faster RCNN by 8.52%.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9924201,IEEE Internet of Things Journal,2023-03-01

Adversarial Attacks Against Acoustic Monitoring of Industrial Machines,"The recent rise of adversarial machine learning exposed the serious vulnerabilities existing in current frameworks depending on the smooth operation of such automated solutions. This article focuses on the critical field of monitoring the health of industrial machines based on the respective acoustic emissions. After building an audio-based monitoring solution using log-Mel spectrograms and convolutional neural networks, we systematically evaluate the applicability of four types of adversarial attacks: 1) fast gradient sign; 2) projected gradient descent; 3) Jacobian saliency map; and 4) Carlini and Wagner  $\ell _{\infty }$ . Seeing the problem from the attacker perspective, we designed two different attack types, aiming at inducing either false positives or false negatives. We define three figures of merit specifically designed to assess the performance of each attack type from diverse points of view. The experimental setup relies on a publicly available data set including acoustic emissions representing four industrial machines, i.e., fan, pump, slider rail, and valve.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85135747630&origin=inward,IEEE Internet of Things Journal,2023-02-15

Distribution of DDS-cerberus authenticated facial recognition streams,"Successful missions in the field often rely upon communication technologies for tactics and coordination. One middleware used in securing these communication channels is Data Distribution Service (DDS) which employs a publish-subscribe model. However, researchers have found several security vulnerabilities in DDS implementations. DDS-Cerberus (DDS-C) is a security layer implemented into DDS to mitigate impersonation attacks using Kerberos authentication and ticketing. Even with the addition of DDS-C, the real-time message sending of DDS also needs to be upheld. This paper extends our previous work to analyze DDS-Câs impact on performance in a use case implementation. The use case covers an artificial intelligence (AI) scenario that connects edge sensors across a commercial network. Specifically, it characterizes how DDS-C performs between unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV), the cloud, and video streams for facial recognition. The experiments send a set number of video frames over the network using DDS to be processed by AI and displayed on a screen. An evaluation of network traffic using DDS-C revealed that it was not statistically significant compared to DDS for the majority of the configuration runs. The results demonstrate that DDS-C provides security benefits without significantly hindering the overall performance.",https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007/s11227-022-04771-2.pdf,The Journal of Supercomputing,2023-02-01

Increasing the Confidence of Deep Neural Networks by Coverage Analysis,"The great performance of machine learning algorithms and deep neural networks in several perception and control tasks is pushing the industry to adopt such technologies in safety-critical applications, as autonomous robots and self-driving vehicles. At present, however, several issues need to be solved to make deep learning methods more trustworthy, predictable, safe, and secure against adversarial attacks. Although several methods have been proposed to improve the trustworthiness of deep neural networks, most of them are tailored for specific classes of adversarial examples, hence failing to detect other corner cases or unsafe inputs that heavily deviate from the training samples. This paper presents a lightweight monitoring architecture based on coverage paradigms to enhance the model robustness against different unsafe inputs. In particular, four coverage analysis methods are proposed and tested in the architecture for evaluating multiple detection logic. Experimental results show that the proposed approach is effective in detecting both powerful adversarial examples and out-of-distribution inputs, introducing limited extra-execution time and memory requirements.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9745342,IEEE Transactions on Software Engineering,2023-02-01

Fault Detection for Unmanned Marine Vehicles Under Replay Attack,"This article investigates the fault detection problem of unmanned marine vehicles (UMVs) under the influence caused by replay attacks. First, the dynamics of UMV are modeled by a Takagi--Sugeno (T--S) fuzzy system with an unknown membership function, which includes the nonlinear coupling of the internal state of the system, the environmental multisource disturbance as well as the potential thruster failure on UMV. Then, the possible replay attack from the sensor to the shore-based center is considered, and a switching-type attack tolerant fault detection filter is designed. Sufficient conditions are given to ensure that the filtering augmented system is stable and with stochastic finite frequency $H_{\infty }$ and $H_{-}$ performances, which reflect the robustness to the disturbance and sensitivity to the fault. On this basis, through a series of mathematical processing, the linear solvable conditions for the design of fault detection filters are obtained. Finally, the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm is verified by simulations.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9921312,IEEE Transactions on Fuzzy Systems,2023-01-01

Lightweight and Bilateral Controllable Data Sharing for Secure Autonomous Vehicles Platooning Service,"Autonomous vehicle platoons are emerging as a promising solution to modern urban governance challenges, such as traffic congestion, air pollution, and fuel waste. As a data-driven paradigm, ensuring secure data sharing is a key challenge for autonomous vehicle platoon applications. However, existing research on secure data sharing of autonomous vehicles platoon suffers from practical weaknesses such as privacy leakage, lack of flexible data source identification, and inefficiency. Motivated by that, this article first proposes the LFBA scheme, which is the first fine-grained data sharing framework that supports bilateral access control and access policy hiding with lightweight and almost constant computational and storage resources consumption, this can be owed to the sophisticated algorithm structure we designed. We then construct an edge-assisted deployment model over LFBA (EA-LFBA) to further improve efficiency and security against common attacks. We then provide the security proof for LFBA, and security analysis for EA-LFBA. Simulation tests and comparative experiments demonstrate the practicality and superiority of our solution compared to state-of-the-art representative works.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=10155176,IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology,2023-01-01
Lifelong Vehicle Trajectory Prediction Framework Based on Generative Replay,"Accurate trajectory prediction of vehicles is essential for reliable autonomous driving. To maintain consistent performance as a vehicle driving around different cities, it is crucial to adapt to changing traffic circumstances and achieve lifelong trajectory prediction model. To realize it, catastrophic forgetting is a main problem to be addressed. In this paper, a divergence measurement method based on conditional Kullback-Leibler divergence is proposed first to evaluate spatiotemporal dependency difference among varied driving circumstances. Then based on generative replay, a novel lifelong vehicle trajectory prediction framework is developed. The framework consists of a conditional generation model and a vehicle trajectory prediction model. The conditional generation model is a generative adversarial network conditioned on position configuration of vehicles. After learning and merging trajectory distribution of vehicles across different cities, the generation model replays trajectories with prior samplings as inputs, which alleviates catastrophic forgetting. The vehicle trajectory prediction model is trained by the replayed trajectories and achieves consistent prediction performance on visited cities. A lifelong experiment setup is established on four open datasets including five tasks. Spatiotemporal dependency divergence is calculated for different tasks. Even though these divergence, the proposed framework exhibits lifelong learning ability and achieves consistent performance on all tasks.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=10214197,IEEE Transactions on Intelligent Transportation Systems,2023-01-01
Event-Triggered Adaptive Security Path Following Control for Unmanned Ground Vehicles Under Sensor Attacks,"This paper is concerned with the event-triggered adaptive security control (ET-ASC) for the path following of networked unmanned ground vehicles (UGVs) subject to sensor attacks. Firstly, a security model is well established to capture the dynamics of path following control of UGVs under sensor attacks. Then, the ET-ASC with respect to correction signal is proposed to mitigate the effects of such sensor attacks. In what follows, two theorems, which include both input to state stability (ISS) criterion and controller design method, are carefully derived for the path following control of UGVs under the proposed ET-ASC scheme. The advantage of the proposed ET-ASC scheme lies in that it can actively amend the sensor attacks in an adaptive way and exclude Zeno phenomenon naturally. At last, a verification simulation experiment are conducted to show the effectiveness of the proposed ET-ASC method.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=10056976,IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology,2023-01-01
"A Systematic Literature Review on Automotive Digital Forensics: Challenges, Technical Solutions and Data Collection","A modern vehicle has a complex internal architecture and is wirelessly connected to the Internet, other vehicles, and the infrastructure. The risk of cyber attacks and other criminal incidents along with recent road accidents caused by autonomous vehicles calls for more research on automotive digital forensics. Failures in automated driving functions can be caused by hardware and software failures and cyber security issues. Thus, it is imperative to be able to determine and investigate the cause of these failures, something which requires trustable data. However, automotive digital forensics is a relatively new field for the automotive where most existing self-monitoring and diagnostic systems in vehicles only monitor safety-related events. To the best of our knowledge, our work is the first systematic literature review on the current research within this field. We identify and assess over 300 papers published between 2006â2021 and further map the relevant papers to different categories based on identified focus areas to give a comprehensive overview of the forensics field and the related research activities. Moreover, we identify forensically relevant data from the literature, link the data to categories, and further map them to required security properties and potential stakeholders. Our categorization makes it easy for practitioners and researchers to quickly find relevant work within a particular sub-field of digital forensics. We believe our contributions can guide digital forensic investigations in automotive and similar areas, such as cyber-physical systems and smart cities, facilitate further research, and serve as a guideline for engineers implementing forensics mechanisms.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85134220336&origin=inward,IEEE Transactions on Intelligent Vehicles,2023-01-01
Lightweight Encryption and Authentication for Controller Area Network of Autonomous Vehicles,"With the rapid development of autonomous vehicles (AVs), vehicle safety has attracted attention. Controller area network (CAN) bus without authentication and encryption mechanisms is a weakness of the in-vehicle network (IVN), and attackers always primarily target the CAN bus. Attacks on the AVs' CAN bus are more frequent because AVs have more external interfaces and sensors than ordinary vehicles. To address the abovementioned issues, this paper proposes a lightweight encryption and authentication scheme for the CAN bus of AVs using message authentication codes and Grain stream cipher. The scheme realizes efficient authentication between electronic control units and a counter re-synchronization protocol is used to ensure that authentication failure owing to counter inconsistency is prevented. Blom key management scheme is employed to rapidly distribute and update session keys, avoiding the complicated process of updating pairwise keys. In addition, considering the scalability of the IVN, a key distribution protocol for new nodes was provided. The security proof using Burrows-Abadi-Needham logic and security analysis prove that the proposed scheme can satisfy the security requirements of the IVN. In addition, performance analysis shows that the proposed scheme can meet real-time requirements and has little impact on the busload.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85161040854&origin=inward,IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology,2023-01-01
Deep Active Learning Intrusion Detection and Load Balancing in Software-Defined Vehicular Networks,"Software-defined vehicular networks (SDVN) can help analyze and reconfigure networks. Massive data generation in autonomous vehicles can lead to issues in network configuration, routing, network characteristics, and system load factors. Load balancing in vehicle sensors helps reduce delays and improve resource utilization. In this paper, we propose a load balancing algorithm to map sensor data, vehicles and data centers performing tasks. A dynamic convergence method is proposed to help identify vehicle system load factors and compare their termination criteria. We also propose a packet-level intrusion detection model. After all load balancing, the model can track the attack on the network. The proposed model further combines the entropy-based active learning and the attention-based model to efficiently identify the attacks. Experiments are then conducted on the standard KDD data to validate the developed models with and without an attention-based active learning mechanism. Our experimental results show that the load balancing mechanism is able to achieve more performance gains than previous techniques. Moreover, the results show that the developed model can improve the decision boundary by using a pooling strategy and an entropy uncertainty measure.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85129409991&origin=inward,IEEE Transactions on Intelligent Transportation Systems,2023-01-01
Autonomous Vehicles Security: Challenges and Solutions Using Blockchain and Artificial Intelligence,"The arrival of autonomous vehicles (AVs) promises many great benefits, including increased safety and reduced energy consumption, pollution, and congestion. However, these engines have many security and privacy issues that could undermine the expected benefits if not addressed. AVs will provide new opportunities for hackers to carry out malicious attacks, posing a great threat to the future of mobility and data protection. The research trend in this field indicates that combining Blockchain and AI could bring strong protection for AVs against malicious attacks. Blockchain and AI have different working paradigms, but when merged, they can empower each other, and solve many security and privacy issues of AVs. AI can optimise the construction of the Blockchain to make it more efficient, secure and energy-saving, where Blockchain provides data immutability and trust mechanism for AI-based solutions and makes them more transparent, trustful, and explainable. Although some research is being conducted on this area, the topic of applying Blockchain and AI for securing AVs is not deeply investigated. In this paper, we explore the possible application of an amalgamation of Blockchain and AI solutions for securing AVs. We first introduce a classification of security and privacy threats that may arise from the application of AVs. Then, we provide an overview of recent literature regarding Blockchain and AI usage for securing AVs. Finally, we highlight limitations and challenges that may face the integration of Blockchain and AI with AVs based on our systemic review and suggest potential future directions for research in this field.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=10023964,IEEE Transactions on Intelligent Transportation Systems,2023-01-01
Secure Consensus of Multiagent Systems With DoS Attacks via Fully Distributed Dynamic Event-Triggered Control,"This article investigates the secure consensus problem of general linear multiagent systems with denial-of-service (DoS) attacks. Owning to the existence of DoS attacks, it is challenging to investigate the event-triggered control of multiagent systems in a fully distributed manner. This article presents a novel dynamic event-triggered mechanism to alleviate the limited communication resources. Moreover, the designed mechanism is fully distributed and scalable owing to the introduction of some adaptive coupling weights. Since the DoS attacks have been considered in the event-triggered rule design, a novel adaptive parameter with an additional exponential term is adopted to deal with DoS attacks. The Lyapunov design also introduces such a term for the subsequent stability analysis. Sufficient conditions guaranteeing the asymptotic consensus of the studied system are developed in light of the controllerâs parameters, duration, and frequency of the DoS attacks. Strict proof is provided to demonstrate that a secure consensus can be reached effectively under the proposed control mechanism. Furthermore, it is shown that the Zeno behavior can be excluded from the designed triggering mechanism. Finally, simulations on a multiagent system consisting of interconnected unmanned intelligent vehicles are conducted to verify the results.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=10159674,"IEEE Transactions on Systems, Man, and Cybernetics: Systems",2023-01-01
Secure Control Design for Networked Control Systems With Nonlinear Dynamics Under Time-Delay-Switch Attacks,"A continuous controller is developed for a centralized network control system (NCS), which is composed of agents with nonlinear dynamics subject to a time-delay-switch (TDS) attack and additive disturbances. Since the state tracking error is unmeasurable during TDS attacks, controllers cannot use the state tracking error to coordinate the NCS. Therefore, a novel error signal is designed to address this unique challenge and enable the NCS to achieve a formation control objective. Furthermore, a TDS attack mitigation strategy is developed, which uses both learning- and model-based approaches to estimate an agentâs state for TDS attack detection and compensation. LyapunovâKrasovskii functionals are used in the stability analysis to prove that the tracking errors converge to a steady-state residual, which is a function of the system uncertainty and TDS attack properties. The leaderâfollower formation control problem for unmanned aerial vehicles based on a pure pursuit guidance law is selected for a simulation study to validate the performance of the proposed method.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85125710505&origin=inward,IEEE Transactions on Automatic Control,2023-01-01
Fast Reactive Mechanism for Desired Trajectory Attacks on Unmanned Aerial Vehicles,"Malware, exposed on the ground control station, can tamper with the unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) interaction information. It makes UAVs vulnerable to the desired trajectory attacks, which deteriorates the flight safety if no timely action is taken. Therefore, this article focus on fast reactive mechanism for desired trajectory attacks on UAVs. A fixed-time detection scheme is proposed based on fixed-time unknown inputs observer and trajectory tracking errors. Subsequently, a fixed-time sliding mode attack observer is developed to compensate the effect caused by attacks. Meanwhile, the estimation errors of attacks can be stabilized within fixed time. Finally, experiment tests are presented to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed methods.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85144007445&origin=inward,IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics,2023-01-01
Resilient Adaptive Finite-Time Fault-Tolerant Control for Heterogeneous Uncertain and Nonlinear Autonomous Connected Vehicles Platoons,"This paper addresses the control problem of heterogeneous uncertain nonlinear autonomous vehicle platoons in the presence of adversarial threats arising in Vehicular Ad-hoc NETworks (VANET) during the information sharing process. As unpredictable faults and/or malicious attacks may affect the trustworthiness of the messages shared among vehicles, a suitable resilient control law, able to enhance the robustness of the platoon formation, is required for the prevention of dangerous events. With the aim of achieving a safe platoon control, we leverage Multi-Agent System (MAS) framework and we design a novel distributed backstepping finite-time control strategy, embedding adaptive mechanisms able to guarantee vehicles fleet resilience with respect to possible occurring faults. The proposed strategy falls into the passive fault-tolerant control framework and, hence, it does not require additional observers for fault detection and isolation, thus reducing the computational burden. Adaptive mechanisms are designed according to Lyapunov-based theory which, in combination with the Barbalat lemma, ensures the stability of the closed-loop vehicular network. More specifically, our approach allows guaranteeing the convergence towards zero of the spacing and speed errors, while ensuring that all adaptive signals are bounded in a finite-time interval. A detailed simulation analysis, including a comparison w.r.t. the technical literature, confirms the theoretical derivation, the effectiveness and the advantages of the proposed resilient control law in ensuring platoon formation for different driving scenarios despite the occurrence of unexpected faults.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=10168202,IEEE Open Journal of Intelligent Transportation Systems,2023-01-01
AdvDDoS: Zero-Query Adversarial Attacks Against Commercial Speech Recognition Systems,"Automatic speech recognition (ASR) has been widely and commercially employed in health care, autonomous vehicles, and finance. Yet, recent studies have shown that universal adversarial perturbations (UAPs) pose a serious threat to white-box ASR systems when the adversary has access to the target model. Until now, the impacts of such a threat on commercial systems are still open since their models are not publicly available. To understand the security weakness in the practical black-box setting, this paper introduces the first zero-query UAP attacks, called AdvDDoS, with black-box access to ASR systems: we do not need to pay any query expense to estimate UAPs. Specifically, we craft targeted UAPs under a popular feature extractor and a local ASR model by reversing the robust target-category features, in which adversarial perturbations containing robust features are believed to have better transferability. Compared with vanilla UAPs, our UAPs incorporated with target-category features lead to better attacks against commercial ASR systems. We validate the efficacy of our AdvDDoS by launching attacks against a range of commercial ASR systems, i.e., three API services (Alibaba, Tencent, and Baidu), and three personal assistants (Apple Siri, iFlytek, and Google). Extensive experimental results demonstrate the superiority of AdvDDoS. For example, AdvDDoS achieves 83.26% word error rate (WER) and 53.25% success rates of attacks (SRoA) for the universal attack against Tencent ASR API, which outperforms the vanilla UAPs by up to 61.56% on WER and 11.6% on SRoA. The success of our attack sheds light on zero-query UAP attacks against commercial ASR systems.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=10145466,IEEE Transactions on Information Forensics and Security,2023-01-01
Secure and Efficient UAV Tracking in Space-Air-Ground Integrated Network,"With the development of 5G and other communication techniques, the space-air-ground integrated network (SAGIN) is regarded as a promising solution to provide wide-range, cost-effective, and real-time wireless access. Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) Tracking plays a crucial role in guaranteeing the performance of SAGIN. However, UAV tracking still faces a series of challenges in the real-world deployment, especially in the case of the presence of malicious attackers, who may launch a series of attacks (e.g., message spoofing attack, routing misbehavior attack) to disrupt the systems. In this study, to enhance the security and efficiency of SAGIN when conducting object tracking, we propose a novel and secure object tracking system named SecTracker to overcome the emerging security problems in the SAGIN. Focusing on the unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) tracking, we design the Local Voting based Detection Module to defend the message spoofing attack and implement the Routing Evidence based Detection Module to defend the routing misbehavior attack. Besides, efficiency enhancement mechanisms (i.e., probabilistic detection algorithm and game theory based algorithm) are proposed in this paper to improve the efficiency of SecTracker. Considering the above-mentioned attacks, the overall tracking accuracy is improved from 88.16% in existing schemes to 96.64% in SecTracker, which demonstrates the effectiveness of the proposed system.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85149859492&origin=inward,IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology,2023-01-01
On-Board Deep-Learning-Based Unmanned Aerial Vehicle Fault Cause Detection and Classification via FPGAs,"With the increase in the use of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs)/drones, it is important to detect and identify causes of failure in real time for proper recovery from a potential crash-like scenario or postincident forensics analysis. The cause of crash could be either a fault in the sensor/actuator system, a physical damage/attack, or a cyber attack on the drone's software. In this work, we propose novel architectures based on deep convolutional and long short-term memory neural networks to detect (via autoencoder) and classify drone misoperations based on real-time sensor data. The proposed architectures are able to learn high-level features automatically from the raw sensor data. Empirical results show that our solution is able to detect (with over 90% accuracy) and classify various types of drone misoperations [with about 99% accuracy (simulation data) and up to 85% accuracy (experimental data)]. Furthermore, with the help of field programmable gate array-based hardware acceleration, we achieved a speedup of 40x ($\sim\!\text{2.6 ms}$) for detection, while consuming half the amount of power compared with onboard GPU devices, such as NVIDIA Jetson TX2.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85169461034&origin=inward,IEEE Transactions on Robotics,2023-01-01
Risk Assessment for Connected Vehicles Under Stealthy Attacks on Vehicle-to-Vehicle Networks,"Cooperative Adaptive Cruise Control (CACC) is an autonomous vehicle-following technology that allows groups of vehicles on the highway to form in tightly-coupled platoons. This is accomplished by exchanging inter-vehicle data through Vehicle-to-Vehicle (V2V) wireless communication networks. CACC increases traffic throughput and safety, and decreases energy consumption. However, the surge of vehicle connectivity has brought new security challenges as vehicular networks increasingly serve as new access points for adversaries trying to deteriorate the platooning performance or even cause collisions. In this manuscript, we propose a novel anomaly detection scheme that leverage real-time sensor/network data and physics-based mathematical models of vehicles in the platoon. Nevertheless, even the best detection scheme could lead to conservative detection results because of unavoidable modelling uncertainties, network effects (delays, quantization, communication dropouts), and noise. It is hard (often impossible) for any detector to distinguish between these different perturbation sources and actual attack signals. This enables adversaries to launch a range of attack strategies that can surpass the detection scheme by hiding within the system uncertainty. Here, we provide risk assessment tools (in terms of semi-definite programs) for Connected and Automated Vehicles (CAVs) to quantify the potential effect of attacks that remain hidden from the detector (referred here as stealthy attacks). A numerical case-study is presented to illustrate the effectiveness of our methods.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=10184481,IEEE Transactions on Intelligent Transportation Systems,2023-01-01
Blockchain-Enabled Authenticated Key Agreement Scheme for Mobile Vehicles-Assisted Precision Agricultural IoT Networks,"Precision farming has a positive potential in the agricultural industry regarding water conservation, increased productivity, better development of rural areas, and increased income. Blockchain technology is a better alternative for storing and sharing farm data as it is reliable, transparent, immutable, and decentralized. Remote monitoring of an agricultural field requires security systems to ensure that any sensitive information is exchanged only among authenticated entities in the network. To this end, we design an efficient blockchain-enabled authenticated key agreement scheme for mobile vehicles-assisted precision agricultural Internet of Things (IoT) networks called  $AgroMobiBlock$ . The limited existing work on authentication in agricultural networks shows passive usage of blockchains with very high costs.  $AgroMobiBlock$  proposes a novel idea using the elliptic curve operations on an active hybrid blockchain over mobile farming vehicles with low computation and communication costs. Formal and informal security analysis along with the formal security verification using the Automated Validation of Internet Security Protocols and Applications (AVISPA) software tool have shown the robustness of  $AgroMobiBlock$  against man-in-the-middle, impersonation, replay, physical capture, and ephemeral secret leakage attacks among other potential attacks. The blockchain-based simulation on large-scale nodes shows the computational time for an increase in the network and block sizes. Moreover, the real-time testbed experiments have been performed to show the practical usefulness of the proposed scheme.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9994772,IEEE Transactions on Information Forensics and Security,2023-01-01
Query-Efficient Adversarial Attack With Low Perturbation Against End-to-End Speech Recognition Systems,"With the widespread use of automated speech recognition (ASR) systems in modern consumer devices, attack against ASR systems have become an attractive topic in recent years. Although related white-box attack methods have achieved remarkable success in fooling neural networks, they rely heavily on obtaining full access to the details of the target models. Due to the lack of prior knowledge of the victim model and the inefficiency in utilizing query results, most of the existing black-box attack methods for ASR systems are query-intensive. In this paper, we propose a new black-box attack called the Monte Carlo gradient sign attack (MGSA) to generate adversarial audio samples with substantially fewer queries. It updates an original sample based on the elements obtained by a Monte Carlo tree search. We attribute its high query efficiency to the effective utilization of the dominant gradient phenomenon, which refers to the fact that only a few elements of each origin sample have significant effect on the output of ASR systems. Extensive experiments are performed to evaluate the efficiency of MGSA and the stealthiness of the generated adversarial examples on the DeepSpeech system. The experimental results show that MGSA achieves 98% and 99% attack success rates on the LibriSpeech and Mozilla Common Voice datasets, respectively. Compared with the state-of-the-art methods, the average number of queries is reduced by 27% and the signal-to-noise ratio is increased by 31%.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9954062,IEEE Transactions on Information Forensics and Security,2023-01-01
"Data Poisoning Attacks in Internet-of-Vehicle Networks: Taxonomy, State-of-The-Art, and Future Directions","With the unprecedented development of deep learning, autonomous vehicles (AVs) have achieved tremendous progress nowadays. However, AV supported by DNN models is vulnerable to data poisoning attacks, hindering the large-scale application of autonomous driving. For example, by injecting carefully designed poisons into the training dataset of the DNN model in the traffic sign recognition system, the attacker can mislead the system to make targeted misclassification or cause a reduction in model classification accuracy. In this article, we conduct a thorough investigation of the state-of-the-art data poisoning attacks and defenses against AVs. According to whether the attacker needs to manipulate the data labeling process, we divide the state-of-the-art attack approaches into two categories, i.e., dirty-label attacks and clean-label attacks. We also differentiate the existing defense methods into two categories based on whether to modify the training data or the models, i.e., data-based defenses and model-based defenses.

Off-Policy Learning-Based Following Control of Cooperative Autonomous Vehicles Under Distributed Attacks,"This paper investigates the resilient distributed secure output path following control problem of heterogeneous autonomous ground vehicles (AGVs) subject to cyber attacks based on reinforcement learning algorithm. Most existing results are subject to the same attack models for all communication channels, however multiple channels launched by different attackers are considered in this paper. First, a predictor-acknowledgement clock algorithm for each vehicle is proposed to judge whether the communication channel among neighboring vehicles is attacked or not by receiving or transmitting an acknowledgement. Then, a resilient distributed predictor is proposed to predict the pinning vehicleâs state for each vehicle. In addition, a resilient local control protocol consisting of the feedforward state provided by the predictor and the local feedback state of each vehicle is developed for the output path following problem, which is further converted to the optimal control problem by designing a discounted performance function. Discounted algebraic Riccati equations (AREs) are derived to address the optimal control problem. An off-policy reinforcement learning (RL) algorithm is put forward to learn the solution of discounted AREs online without any prior knowledge of vehiclesâ dynamics. It is shown that the RL-based output path following control problem of AGVs imposed by cyber attacks can be achieved in an optimal manner. Finally, a numerical example is provided to verify the effectiveness of theoretical analysis.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85148418163&origin=inward,IEEE Transactions on Intelligent Transportation Systems,2023-01-01
LSTM-Based Distributed Conditional Generative Adversarial Network for Data-Driven 5G-Enabled Maritime UAV Communications,"5G enabled maritime unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) communication is one of the important applications of 5G wireless network which requires minimum latency and higher reliability to support mission-critical applications. Therefore, lossless reliable communication with a high data rate is the key requirement in modern wireless communication systems. These all factors highly depend upon channel conditions. In this work, a channel model is proposed for air-to-surface link exploiting millimeter wave (mmWave) for 5G enabled maritime unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) communication. Firstly, we will present the formulated channel estimation method which directly aims to adopt channel state information (CSI) of mmWave from the channel model inculcated by UAV operating within the Long Short Term Memory (LSTM)-Distributed Conditional generative adversarial network (DCGAN) i.e. (LSTM-DCGAN) for each beamforming direction. Secondly, to enhance the applications for the proposed trained channel model for the spatial domain, we have designed an LSTM-DCGAN based UAV network, where each one will learn mmWave CSI for all the distributions. Lastly, we have categorized the most favorable LSTM-DCGAN training method and emanated certain conditions for our UAV network to increase the channel model learning rate. Simulation results have shown that the proposed LSTM-DCGAN based network is vigorous to the error generated through local training. A detailed comparison has been done with the other available state-of-the-art CGAN network architectures i.e. stand-alone CGAN (without CSI sharing), Simple CGAN (with CSI sharing), multi-discriminator CGAN, federated learning CGAN and DCGAN. Simulation results have shown that the proposed LSTM-DCGAN structure demonstrates higher accuracy during the learning process and attained more data rate for downlink transmission as compared to the previous state of artworks.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85135248481&origin=inward,IEEE Transactions on Intelligent Transportation Systems,2023-01-01
ADS-Lead: Lifelong Anomaly Detection in Autonomous Driving Systems,"Autonomous Vehicles (AVs) are closely connected in the Cooperative Intelligent Transportation System (C-ITS). They are equipped with various sensors and controlled by Autonomous Driving Systems (ADSs) to provide high-level autonomy. The vehicles exchange different types of real-time data with each other, which can help reduce traffic accidents and congestion, and improve the efficiency of transportation systems. However, when interacting with the environment, AVs suffer from a broad attack surface, and the sensory data are susceptible to anomalies caused by faults, sensor malfunctions, or attacks, which may jeopardize traffic safety and result in serious accidents. In this paper, we propose ADS-Lead, an efficient collaborative anomaly detection methodology to protect the lane-following mechanism of ADSs. ADS-Lead is equipped with a novel transformer-based one-class classification model to identify time series anomalies (GPS spoofing threat) and adversarial image examples (traffic sign and lane recognition attacks). Besides, AVs inside the C-ITS form a cognitive network, enabling us to apply the federated learning technology to our anomaly detection method, where the vehicles in the C-ITS jointly update the detection model with higher model generalization and data privacy. Experiments on Baidu Apollo and two public data sets (GTSRB and Tumsimple) indicate that our method can not only detect sensor anomalies effectively and efficiently but also outperform state-of-the-art anomaly detection methods.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85123793938&origin=inward,IEEE Transactions on Intelligent Transportation Systems,2023-01-01
Secure Cooperative Path Following of Autonomous Surface Vehicles Under Cyber and Physical Attacks,"This paper is concerned with the networked cooperative path following (CPF) problem for multiple autonomous surface vehicles (ASVs) subject to simultaneous cyber and physical attacks. First, to compensate the adverse effects of the physical-attack-induced bias injections, an extended state observer is designed to provide real-time estimates of the unmeasured velocities and unknown nonlinear terms. Next, to identify and handle various cyber attacks, a novel secure data transmission mechanism, featuring a secure transmitter and a secure receiver, is developed for each ASV. Then, a secure CPF control scheme, consisting of a networked cooperative kinematic control law and a networked kinetic control law, is presented. Furthermore, the observer error dynamics and networked CPF error dynamics are derived to account for the simultaneous network-induced delays, packet dropouts, physical attacks, and cyber attacks. The proposed control scheme is capable to preserve satisfactory secure tracking performance of the resulting CPF control system under a desired reference path even in the presence of external environmental disturbances, delays, packet dropouts, and malicious attacks. Finally, several case studies are provided to substantiate the effectiveness of the secure CPF control scheme.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=10108032,IEEE Transactions on Intelligent Vehicles,2023-01-01
A Survey on Safety-Critical Driving Scenario GenerationâA Methodological Perspective,"Autonomous driving systems have witnessed significant development during the past years thanks to the advance in machine learning-enabled sensing and decision-making algorithms. One critical challenge for their massive deployment in the real world is their safety evaluation. Most existing driving systems are still trained and evaluated on naturalistic scenarios collected from daily life or heuristically-generated adversarial ones. However, the large population of cars, in general, leads to an extremely low collision rate, indicating that safety-critical scenarios are rare in the collected real-world data. Thus, methods to artificially generate scenarios become crucial to measure the risk and reduce the cost. In this survey, we focus on the algorithms of safety-critical scenario generation in autonomous driving. We first provide a comprehensive taxonomy of existing algorithms by dividing them into three categories: data-driven generation, adversarial generation, and knowledge-based generation. Then, we discuss useful tools for scenario generation, including simulation platforms and packages. Finally, we extend our discussion to five main challenges of current worksâ fidelity, efficiency, diversity, transferability, controllabilityâ and research opportunities lighted up by these challenges.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=10089194,IEEE Transactions on Intelligent Transportation Systems,2023-01-01
A Search-Based Testing Approach for Deep Reinforcement Learning Agents,"Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) algorithms have been increasingly employed during the last decade to solve various decision-making problems such as autonomous driving, trading decisions, and robotics. However, these algorithms have faced great challenges when deployed in safety-critical environments since they often exhibit erroneous behaviors that can lead to potentially critical errors. One of the ways to assess the safety of DRL agents is to test them to detect possible faults leading to critical failures during their execution. This raises the question of how we can efficiently test DRL policies to ensure their correctness and adherence to safety requirements. Most existing works on testing DRL agents use adversarial attacks that perturb states or actions of the agent. However, such attacks often lead to unrealistic states of the environment. Furthermore, their main goal is to test the robustness of DRL agents rather than testing the compliance of the agentsâ policies with respect to requirements. Due to the huge state space of DRL environments, the high cost of test execution, and the black-box nature of DRL algorithms, exhaustive testing of DRL agents is impossible. In this paper, we propose a Search-based Testing Approach of Reinforcement Learning Agents (STARLA) to test the policy of a DRL agent by effectively searching for failing executions of the agent within a limited testing budget. We rely on machine learning models and a dedicated genetic algorithm to narrow the search toward faulty episodes (i.e., sequences of states and actions produced by the DRL agent). We apply STARLA on Deep-Q-Learning agents trained on two different RL problems widely used as benchmarks and show that STARLA significantly outperforms Random Testing by detecting more faults related to the agent's policy. We also investigate how to extract rules that characterize faulty episodes of the DRL agent using our search results. Such rules can be used to understand the conditions under which the agent fails and thus assess the risks of deploying it.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=10107813,IEEE Transactions on Software Engineering,2023-01-01
Resilient Control for Multiagent Systems With a Sampled-Data Model Against DoS Attacks,"To reduce the computational burden and resist the denial-of-service (DoS) attacks, a resilient distributed sampled-data control scheme is proposed for multiagent systems. The agent states are sampled periodically by the sensors. DoS attacks disrupt the data communication from transmitters to controllers randomly or periodically with a limited duration time. Information on DoS attacks can be obtained by introducing novel logic processors embedded in corresponding controllers. Next, the problem of resilient control can be converted into one concerned with the upper and lower bound of the sampling interval of an aperiodic sampled-data control system. Some sufficient criteria for developing resilient distributed controllers are derived using the novel looped Lyapunov functional approach and the free-matrix-based inequality method. Finally, two illustrative examples, unmanned aerial vehicles and the two-mass-spring systems, are provided to demonstrate the efficiency of the proposed resilient distributed sampled-data control protocols against the DoS attacks.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85128270426&origin=inward,IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics,2023-01-01
QoS-Dependent Event-Triggered Control for UAVs on Cognitive Radio Networks Subject to Deception Attacks,"Based on cognitive radio (CR) networks, this paper considers event-triggered control for unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) systems subject to deception attacks. Two states (ON and OFF) are switched in CR networks. For the switched model, a new Quality of Service (QoS)-dependent event-triggered scheme (ETS) is proposed over CR networks under deception attacks. For a non-ideal QoS, more sensitive trigger parameters are required against deception attacks. For an ideal QoS, less sensitive trigger parameters are adjusted to reduce data transmissions. Based on the QoS-dependent ETS, a new switched system is modeled subject to deception attacks. By constructing the Lyapunov functional, the criteria are obtained to guarantee the exponential mean-square stability of UAV systems and the desired $\mathcal {L}_{\infty }$ performance. Moreover, an algorithm is developed to adjust the parameters of QoS-dependent ETS according to the QoS of CR network. Finally, an UAV system is utilized to show the effectiveness of the proposed approach.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=10111014,IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology,2023-01-01
ETD: An Efficient Time Delay Attack Detection Framework for UAV Networks,"In recent years, Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) networks are widely used in both military and civilian scenarios. However, due to the distributed nature, they are also vulnerable to threats from adversaries. Time delay attack is a type of internal attack which maliciously delays the transmission of data packets and further causes great damage to UAV networks. Furthermore, it is easy to implement and difficult to detect due to the avoidance of packet modification and the unique characteristics of UAV networks. However, to the best of our knowledge, there is no research on time delay attack detection in UAV networks. In this paper, we propose an Efficient Time Delay Attack Detection Framework (ETD). First, we collect and select delay-related features from four different dimensions, namely delay, node, message and connection. Meanwhile, we utilize the pre-planned trajectory information to accurately calculate the real forwarding delay of nodes. Then, one-class classification is used to train the detection model, and the forwarding behaviors of all nodes can be evaluated, based on which their trust values can be obtained. Finally, the K-Means clustering method is used to distinguish malicious nodes from benign ones according to their trust values. Through extensive simulation, we demonstrate that ETD can achieve higher than 80% detection accuracy with less than 2.5% extra overhead in various settings of UAV networks and different routing protocols.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85159839549&origin=inward,IEEE Transactions on Information Forensics and Security,2023-01-01
Adaptive Event-Triggered Fuzzy Positioning Control for Unmanned Marine Vehicles With Actuator Saturation and Hybrid Attacks,"In this article, we focus on the event-triggered observer-based fuzzy positioning control and $L_{2}$-gain analysis of nonlinear unmanned marine vehicle (UMV) systems in network environments, which is subject to a hybrid attack consisting of denial-of-service attack and deception attack. First, based on the Tagaki-Sugeno fuzzy modeling method, a unified switched system model is established for the positioning control of nonlinear UMV systems with actuator saturation, multiplicative gain uncertainties, external disturbance, and hybrid attacks. Then, by resorting to introducing the integral-type state error, a novel adaptive memory-based event-triggered mechanism is proposed to lighten the communication load in UMV systems. Furthermore, a sufficient criterion is proposed to make the mean square exponential stability of UMV systems with a nonweighted $L_{2}$-gain level be guaranteed, and gain parameters of the designed controller and observer are also solved efficiently. Finally, the simulation example demonstrates the effectiveness of the proposed nonfragile control strategy.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=10039682,IEEE Transactions on Fuzzy Systems,2023-01-01
A Data-Driven CyberâPhysical System Using Deep-Learning Convolutional Neural Networks: Study on False-Data Injection Attacks in an Unmanned Ground Vehicle Under Fault-Tolerant Conditions,"Leveraging the benefits of deep-learning convolutional neural networks, we introduce a new data-driven cyberâphysical system specifically designed to address the vulnerability of middleware software, namely, Robot Operating System (ROS), widely implemented in robotics in both civilian and military domains. As for our research platform, we employ the GVR-BOT unmanned ground vehicle, which is a replicate of the U.S. Army ground robot. We focus our study on the ability of the ground robot to operate under fault-tolerant conditions, making it challenging from the standpoint of cybersecurity to differentiate between legitimate and malicious operations. The GVR-BOT ground vehicle belongs to a class of differential drive ground robots and employs ROS in its onboard computer to interact with users. To facilitate deep learning, we develop a large database of images based on the network-traffic data of ROS, describing the dynamics of the GVR-BOT ground robot under legitimate and malicious operations. We use our image database to train and validate the performance of our deep-learning CNN system. Given a set of RGB/grayscale images describing the normalized time-series data representing the dynamics of the GVR-BOT ground robot, the objective of our proposed cybersecurity algorithm is to safeguard the legitimate operation of the ground robot under fault-tolerant conditions, such that any attempts to compromise its performance (e.g., malicious attacks) can be prevented within the minimum detection time. Our research indicates a promising result as our system is capable of detecting malicious attacks with high accuracy while recognizing its legitimate operations with reasonably small false-positive rates.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9812734,"IEEE Transactions on Systems, Man, and Cybernetics: Systems",2023-01-01
WKN-OC: A New Deep Learning Method for Anomaly Detection in Intelligent Vehicles,"Connected and automated vehicles (CAVs) play a vital role in transforming human mobility, tackling road congestion and road safety. However, CAVs rely heavily on the security, accuracy, and stability of sensor readings and network data. Abnormal sensor readings caused by malicious cyberattacks or faulty car sensors can have devastating consequences, possibly even lead to a fatal crash. In order to avoid the CAVs data anomalies caused by network attacks or data failures, we propose a Wavelet Kernel Network with Omni-Scale Convolutional (WKN-OC) for anomaly detection in intelligent transportation systems (ITS), which can select the optimal scale adaptively and processes high-frequency signals better. The proposed method pays more attention to the high-frequency components of input data, and fully extracts valuable features through the feature extraction framework, so that the model has strong anomaly detection performance. We verify the reliability of the WKN-OC method on the Safe Pilot Model Deployment (SPMD) data set. It is shown that the proposed WKN-OC model has good detection performance for various anomaly data, especially in the mixed anomaly experiment. We have achieved 96.78% average accuracy in mixed anomaly experiments and 96.13% accuracy in multi anomaly experiments. The results show that the model has strong generalization performance for the anomaly detection problem faced by the Internet of Vehicles (IoVs) and can identify the unknown anomalies in reality well.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85149408876&origin=inward,IEEE Transactions on Intelligent Vehicles,2023-01-01
Safety-Aware Vehicle Trajectory Prediction With Spatiotemporal Attentional GAN in Hybrid Transportation System,"During the transition from human-driven vehicles (HDVs) to a fully connected automated vehicle (CAV) traffic environment, the hybrid transportation system in which HDVs and CAVs coexist will face challenges owing to the uncertainty of HDVs trajectories. Accurately predicting the trajectories of HDVs and conducting safety warnings for them are essential to improve the safety of the hybrid transportation system. In this article, we propose a safety-aware vehicle trajectory prediction with spatiotemporal attentional generative adversarial network (GAN) (SSTAttGAN) in the hybrid transportation system. Considering multiple driving characteristics, a driving pattern clustering mechanism based on spectral clustering is introduced to analyze vehicle behavior from the perspective of enhancing safety. In the GAN-based trajectory prediction model, a spatiotemporal attention mechanism is proposed as a module of the GAN generator, through which optimal weight distributions of various spatiotemporal features affecting trajectories can be obtained to improve prediction accuracy. The experimental evaluation on the real trajectory dataset demonstrates that our scheme outperforms state-of-the-art methods. Specifically, the root-mean-square error (RMSE) of our model on the next-generation simulation (NGSIM) dataset is 0.39 and 2.09 m in the predicted 1- and 5-s time horizons, respectively. Also, the RMSE on the HighD dataset is 0.09 and 0.92 m in the predicted 1- and 5-s time horizons, respectively.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=10295522,IEEE Transactions on Instrumentation and Measurement,2023-01-01
Time-Driven and Privacy-Preserving Navigation Model for Vehicle-to-Vehicle Communication Systems,"Effective time-driven navigation is an operative way to alleviate traffic congestion, which is also a challenging problem in the Internet of Vehicles context. Most existing centralized navigation systems often cannot react promptly to real-time local traffic situations, while most existing distributed navigation systems are vulnerable to privacy attacks. To overcome these drawbacks, we propose a learning model that provides a provable guarantee of vehicles' privacy while still enabling efficient navigation under real-time traffic conditions. The proposed model adopts a novel multi-agent system with customized differentially private mechanisms. To verify the effectiveness and stability of our approach, we implement the proposed method on CARLA, which is an autonomous driving simulator.

AST-SafeSec: Adaptive Stress Testing for Safety and Security Co-Analysis of Cyber-Physical Systems,"Cyber-physical systems are becoming more intelligent with the adoption of heterogeneous sensor networks and machine learning capabilities that deal with an increasing amount of input data. While this complexity aims to solve problems in various domains, it adds new challenges for the system assurance. One issue is the rise in the number of abnormal behaviors that affect system performance due to possible sensor faults and attacks. The combination of safety risks, which are usually caused by random sensor faults and security risks that can happen during any random system state, makes the full coverage testing of the cyber-physical system challenging. Existing techniques are inadequate to deal with complex safety and security co-risks against cyber-physical systems. In this paper, we propose AST-SafeSec, an analysis methodology for both safety and security aspects that utilizes reinforcement learning to identify the most likely adversarial paths at various normal or failure states of a cyber-physical system that can influence system behavior through its sensor data. The methodology is evaluated using an autonomous vehicle scenario by incorporating a security attack into the stochastic sensor elements of a vehicle. Evaluation results show that the methodology analyzes the interaction of malicious attacks with random faults and identifies the incident caused by the interactions and the most likely path that leads to the incident.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85169702135&origin=inward,IEEE Transactions on Information Forensics and Security,2023-01-01
Secure Long-Range Autonomous Valet Parking: A Reservation Scheme With Three-Factor Authentication and Key Agreement,"Long-range autonomous valet parking (LAVP) is a current trend, partly due to traffic congestion and parking headache. For large-scale parking demands, reservation is introduced to effectively manage valet parking. However, existing schemes focus on parking request verification and parking check-in, which aren't applicable to LAVP because they ignore identity legitimacy and communication security in the phase of picking up as well as dropping off passengers. One viable solution is authentication and key agreement (AKA) protocol. Generally, due to low entropy of passwords and dictionary attacks, three-factor (i.e. passwords, biometrics, and smart card) AKA is more secure than single- and two-factor AKA. Unfortunately, known attacks and high overheads hinder the application of three-factor AKA in real-world environments. Hence, one of the most tough tasks is to balance security and availability, especially how to address the potential threats introduced by each factor while taking full advantage of three factors. Inspired by the above challenges, we propose a provably secure three-factor AKA protocol for reservation services in LAVP, namely SecLAVP. Specifically, the passenger and the autonomous vehicle ($AV$) complete mutual authentication with the assistance of drop-off/pick-up point ($DP$). After successful authentication, the session key is generated between the passenger, $DP$, and $AV$ for secure communication. In the Real-Or-Random (ROR) model, we formally prove SecLAVP satisfies session-key security. Then, we apply AVISPA to simulate our proposed protocol, to demonstrate that SecLAVP can resist man-in-the-middle attacks. Additionally, informal security analysis indicates that SecLAVP satisfies our defined 16 design goals concerning security. Finally, we evaluate performance of SecLAVP in terms of communication overheads, computational overheads, and scheduling, to manifest the feasibility.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9930623,IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology,2023-01-01
AIRA-DA: Adversarial Image Reconstruction Alignments for Unsupervised Domain Adaptive Object Detection,"Unsupervised domain adaptive object detection is a challenging perception task where object detectors are adapted from a label-rich source domain to an unlabeled target domain, playing a vital role in autonomous driving and robot navigation. Since the camera settings, weather, and light conditions vary depending on the road, it is labor-intensive and impossible to manually annotate all the data to adapt to these scenarios. Recent advances demonstrate the effectiveness of adversarial-based domain alignment, where domain invariance in the feature space is produced by adversarial training between the feature extractor and domain discriminator. However, due to the domain shift, domain discrimination, especially on low-level features, is an easy task. This results in an imbalance of the adversarial training between the domain discriminator and the feature extractor. In this work, we achieve a better domain alignment by introducing an auxiliary regularization task to improve the training balance. Specifically, we propose Adversarial Image Reconstruction (AIR) as the regularizer to facilitate the adversarial training of the feature extractor. We further design a multi-level Feature Alignment(A) module to enhance the adaptation performance. We refer our work as AIRA-DA for ease of presentation. Our evaluations across several datasets of challenging domain shifts demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms all previous methods, of both one- and two-stage, in most settings. Extensive experiments shows that the proposed method is capable of handling weather variation, cross-camera adaptation and synthetic-to-real-world adaptation.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=10103159,IEEE Robotics and Automation Letters,2023-01-01
Resilient Path Planning of Unmanned Aerial Vehicles Against Covert Attacks on Ultrawideband Sensors,"In this article, a resilient path planning scheme is proposed to navigate an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) to its planned (nominal) destination with minimum energy consumption in the presence of a strategic attacker. The UAV is equipped with the following two sensors: 1) a GPS sensor, which is vulnerable to spoofing attacks; 2) a well-functioning ultrawideband (UWB) sensor, which is possible to be deceived. It is shown that a covert attacker can significantly deviate the UAV's path without being detected by the UWB sensor by simultaneously corrupting the GPS signals and forging control inputs. The prerequisite for the attack occurrence is first discussed. Based on this prerequisite, an optimal attack scheme is proposed, which maximizes the deviation between the nominal destination and the real one. Correspondingly, an energy-efficient and resilient navigation scheme based on Pontryagin's maximum principle is formulated, which suppresses the above covert attacker effectively. Essentially, this problem can be seen as a Stackelberg game between a resilient path planner (defender) and a covert attacker. The effectiveness of our theoretical results is illustrated via two simulation examples.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=10036104,IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics,2023-01-01
End-to-End Autonomous Driving With Semantic Depth Cloud Mapping and Multi-Agent,"Focusing on the task of point-to-point navigation for an autonomous driving vehicle, we propose a novel deep learning model trained with end-to-end and multi-task learning manners to perform both perception and control tasks simultaneously. The model is used to drive the ego vehicle safely by following a sequence of routes defined by the global planner. The perception part of the model is used to encode high-dimensional observation data provided by an RGBD camera while performing semantic segmentation, semantic depth cloud (SDC) mapping, and traffic light state and stop sign prediction. Then, the control part decodes the encoded features along with additional information provided by GPS and speedometer to predict waypoints that come with a latent feature space. Furthermore, two agents are employed to process these outputs and make a control policy that determines the level of steering, throttle, and brake as the final action. The model is evaluated on CARLA simulator with various scenarios made of normal-adversarial situations and different weathers to mimic real-world conditions. In addition, we do a comparative study with some recent models to justify the performance in multiple aspects of driving. Moreover, we also conduct an ablation study on SDC mapping and multi-agent to understand their roles and behavior. As a result, our model achieves the highest driving score even with fewer parameters and computation load.

Resilient Countermeasures Against Cyber-Attacks on Self-Driving Car Architecture,"Self-driving cars, believed to be on track to become a seven trillion-dollar industry by 2050, are likely to be a popular mode of transportation in the near future, as the technology promises safety and efficiency. Significant advances have been made to achieve these objectives. However, the idea of a self-driving car completing its goals without human intervention in the presence of uncertainties is still posed with challenges. These challenges mostly relate to decision-making under uncertainties that could arise from transient faults or deliberate attempts to disrupt the system in favor of adversarial motives. Traditional schemes of hardening the system against known compromises will not suffice primarily because of the sophistication adversarial attempts have come to achieve and the rate at which new attacks are being devised. The problem demands a solution that is resilient to attacks and that would allow a self-driving vehicle to complete its designated task in the presence of attacks or faults. Several attempts have been made towards achieving resilience in autonomous vehicles. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work to give a thorough review on the resilient approaches adopted in the context and presents a taxonomy of such approaches. The paper also includes a brief introduction to the architecture of self-driving vehicles and its vulnerabilities in the presented context. This paper also discusses a novel approach using N-version programming for resilience.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85163440664&origin=inward,IEEE Transactions on Intelligent Transportation Systems,2023-01-01
Robust Lane Change Decision Making for Autonomous Vehicles: An Observation Adversarial Reinforcement Learning Approach,"Reinforcementlearning holds the promise of allowing autonomous vehicles to learn complex decision making behaviors through interacting with other traffic participants. However, many real-world driving tasks involve unpredictable perception errors or measurement noises which may mislead an autonomous vehicle into making unsafe decisions, even cause catastrophic failures. In light of these risks, to ensure safety under perception uncertainty, autonomous vehicles are required to be able to cope with the worst case observation perturbations. Therefore, this paper proposes a novel observation adversarial reinforcement learning approach for robust lane change decision making of autonomous vehicles. A constrained observation-robust Markov decision process is presented to model lane change decision making behaviors of autonomous vehicles under policy constraints and observation uncertainties. Meanwhile, a black-box attack technique based on Bayesian optimization is implemented to approximate the optimal adversarial observation perturbations efficiently. Furthermore, a constrained observation-robust actor-critic algorithm is advanced to optimize autonomous driving lane change policies while keeping the variations of the policies attacked by the optimal adversarial observation perturbations within bounds. Finally, the robust lane change decision making approach is evaluated in three stochastic mixed traffic flows based on different densities. The results demonstrate that the proposed method can not only enhance the performance of an autonomous vehicle but also improve the robustness of lane change policies against adversarial observation perturbations.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85127767057&origin=inward,IEEE Transactions on Intelligent Vehicles,2023-01-01
Learning When to Use Adaptive Adversarial Image Perturbations Against Autonomous Vehicles,"Deep neural network (DNN) models are widely used in autonomous vehicles for object detection using camera images. However, these models are vulnerable to adversarial image perturbations. Existing methods for generating these perturbations use the image frame as the decision variable, resulting in a computationally expensive optimization process that starts over for each new image. Few approaches have been developed for attacking online image streams while considering the physical dynamics of autonomous vehicles, their mission, and the environment. To address these challenges, we propose a multi-level stochastic optimization framework that monitors the attacker's capability to generate adversarial perturbations. Our framework introduces a binary decision attack/not attack based on the attacker's capability level to enhance its effectiveness. We evaluate our proposed framework using simulations for vision-guided autonomous vehicles and actual tests with a small indoor drone in an office environment. Our results demonstrate that our method is capable of generating real-time image attacks while monitoring the attacker's proficiency given state estimates.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85161009954&origin=inward,IEEE Robotics and Automation Letters,2023-01-01
Fixed-Time Resilient Edge-Triggered Estimation and Control of Surface Vehicles for Cooperative Target Tracking Under Attacks,"This paper is concerned with the cooperative target tracking of under-actuated unmanned surface vehicles (USVs) with event-triggered communications subject to denial-of-service (DoS) attacks. The target position information can be sensed by a fraction of follower USVs only. A fixed-time resilient cooperative edge-triggered estimation and control architecture is presented for achieving cooperative target tracking under DoS attacks. Specifically, a distributed edge-triggered fixed-time extended state observer (ESO) is designed to recover the position and velocity of the target with a prescribed time regardless of the unreliable communication network subject to DoS attacks. Moreover, the communication burden of the network is reduced by the proposed edge-triggered mechanism. In the control law design, a fixed-time ESO is designed for estimating the model uncertainties and external disturbances in an earth-fixed reference frame. Then, a fixed-time target tracking control law is proposed for each follower USV based on the fixed-time ESO. It is proven that the error signals in the closed-loop control system of USVs are convergent to the origin in a fixed time. An example is provided to substantiate the effectiveness of the proposed fixed-time resilient cooperative edge-triggered estimation and control architecture for USVs.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9799547,IEEE Transactions on Intelligent Vehicles,2023-01-01
Data Freshness Optimization Under CAA in the UAV-Aided MECN: A Potential Game Perspective,"As a promising enabler for edge intelligence, Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAV) have become more and more important in Mobile Edge Computing Networks (MECN), such as communication, computation, collection and control service supply. Although Age of Information (AoI) minimization is indispensable for fresh information collection and computation in the UAV-aided MECN, some attackers can launch attacks to deteriorate the availability of precious channel resources, such as revealed channel access attacks (CAAs). Moreover, recent research has not considered the systemâs active probability and security issues concurrently, e.g., CAA, in the average AoI minimization process. In this paper, to deal with this problem, we consider an AoI-oriented channel access problem under CAA with a game theory viewpoint. Firstly, to obtain a MECN-based AoI indicator under CAA, the system model with active probability consideration is established. Next, the channel access-based AoI minimization problem is formulated from the viewpoint of the Ordinary Potential Game (OPG). Furthermore, two algorithms called AACSD and DCASD are proposed to determine channel access strategies, by which the Nash Equilibrium (NE) solution of the OPG could be reached. Finally, experiments are conducted under homogeneous and heterogeneous parameter settings, and the simulation results evaluate the correctness and effectiveness of our proposals.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9762890,IEEE Transactions on Intelligent Transportation Systems,2023-01-01
Hawk-Pigeon Game Tactics for Unmanned Aerial Vehicle Swarm Target Defense,"Unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) swarm target defense is a crucial and practical issue about group decision-making and cooperative control in multiagent systems. Hawk-pigeon game architecture is presented in this article to guide UAV swarm target defense. Firstly, a 6-degree-of-freedom UAV model is employed, and the control command converter is derived, which could be widely used in the transformation from the second-order integrator model to the 6-DOF UAV model. Moreover, the attack tactics and pursuit strategies of the defender UAVs are proposed inspired by the hawk's hunting mechanism, and the dynamic model of the attacker UAVs is formulated inspired by pigeon group homing behavior. Furthermore, the victory zone of the hawk-pigeon game is analyzed using the time of interception and explicitly exhibited in isochrones means. The proposed method is scalable and adaptive, adopting distributed decision-making to support large-scale UAV swarm engagement. Finally, comparative experiments in different scenarios demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method over state-of-the-art target-attacker-defender game methods on the win rate, the number of captures, and activity time.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85149386902&origin=inward,IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics,2023-01-01
Dynamic UAV Swarm Confrontation: An Imitation Based on Mobile Adaptive Networks,"Cooperative unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) swarms could expand the mission capability of the single UAV and the overall combat effectiveness. We consider the dynamic scenarios where an UAV swarm confronts multiple maneuvering high-value targets (HVTs) and multiple maneuvering attackers. In such hostile scenarios, each UAV of the UAV swarm would generally strive to survive through collaboratively offending their opponents and self-defense from potential attacks. We consider modeling UAV swarms as biologically inspired mobile adaptive networks to imitate the dynamic confrontations of UAV swarms. It is essential to develop an efficient motion control mechanism underpinned by both target tracking and decision making so as to enhance the capability of UAV swarms. We formulate a distributed modularized framework incorporating collaboratively tracking multiple opponents, making successive and prompt decisions, and controlling motion mechanism for mobile adaptive networks. We develop the diffusion multitask interactive Kalman filter to efficiently track multiple preys (HVTs) and multiple predators (attackers). We further develop the collaborative decision making on prey pursuit or predator evasion such that each UAV would acquire early warnings and predictions of the most hypothetically threatening predators to enhance the effectiveness of self-defense. Moreover, we develop a composite motion control mechanism, such that each UAV would be steered toward the prey or away from any approaching predator in a self-organized manner at a variable speed. The modular design of the proposed framework would promote the affordability and adaptability of UAV swarms. Illustrative simulation results validate the efficacy of the proposed distributed framework and the underlying algorithms.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85162881420&origin=inward,IEEE Transactions on Aerospace and Electronic Systems,2023-01-01
Adversarial Blur-Deblur Network for Robust UAV Tracking,"Unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) tracking has been widely applied in real-world applications such as surveillance and monitoring. However, the inherent high maneuverability and agility of UAV often lead to motion blur, which can impair the visual appearance of the target object and easily degrade the existing trackers. To overcome this challenge, this work proposes a tracking-oriented adversarial blur-deblur network (ABDNet), composed of a novel deblurrer to recover the visual appearance of the tracked object, and a brand-new blur generator to produce realistic blurry images for adversarial training. More specifically, the deblurrer progressively refines the features through pixel-wise, spatial-wise, and channel-wise stages to achieve excellent deblurring performance. The blur generator adaptively fuses an image sequence with a learnable kernel to create realistic blurry images. During training, ABDNet is plugged into the state-of-the-art real-time trackers and trained with blurring-deblurring loss as well as tracking loss. During inference, the blur generator is removed, while the deblurrer and the tracker can work together for UAV tracking. Extensive experiments in both public datasets and real-world testing have validated the effectiveness of ABDNet.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85147277335&origin=inward,IEEE Robotics and Automation Letters,2023-01-01
Infrastructure-Enabled GPS Spoofing Detection and Correction,"Accurate and robust localization is crucial for supporting high-level driving automation and safety. Modern localization solutions rely on various sensors, among which GPS has been and will continue to be essential. However, GPS can be vulnerable to malicious attacks and GPS spoofing has been identified as a high threat. With transportation infrastructure becoming increasingly important in supporting emerging vehicle technologies and systems, this study explores the potential of applying infrastructure data for defending against GPS spoofing. We propose an infrastructure-enabled framework using roadside units as an independent, secured data source. A real-time detector, based on the Isolation Forest, is constructed to detect GPS spoofing. Once spoofing is detected, GPS measurements are isolated, and the potentially compromised location estimator is corrected using secure infrastructure data. We test the proposed method using both simulation and real-world data and show its effectiveness in defending against various GPS spoofing attacks, including stealthy attacks that are proposed to fail the production-grade autonomous driving systems.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85166746307&origin=inward,IEEE Transactions on Intelligent Transportation Systems,2023-01-01
Secure Computation Offloading for Marine IoT: An Energy-Efficient Design via Cooperative Jamming,"In smart ocean, the Marine Internet of Things (M-IoT) is ubiquitously used for data acquisition, communication connections, task computation, and so on. However, high-efficient energy consumption and secure yet low-latency transmission is subject to IoT devices' computation capacity and transmit power limitation, as well as wireless communication's broadcast characteristics. In this paper, we investigate the secure computation offloading in M-IoT with the assistance of unmanned surface vehicles (USVs) subject to the eavesdropping attack. In particular, we consider a scenario in which USVs are firstly scheduled to set up a high-quality communication link to the high altitude platform (HAP) and then exploited to provide cooperative jamming for the communication security at the physical layer when the HAP is performing computation offloading. We jointly optimize the USVs' positions, the duration of data uploading, the workload offloaded by HAP, the HAP's transmission power, and each USV's jamming signal power to minimize the system-wise energy consumption for completing the total workloads under the latency constraint. Despite the non-convexity, we decompose the problem vertically into a top problem that optimizes the USVs' positions and a bottom problem that optimizes the other variables. The Polyblock outer Approximation and bisection Search based algorithm (PAS-Algorithm) is proposed to alternatively optimize the variables in the bottom problem. And the Code bAsed croSs Entropy algorithm (CASE-Algorithm) is proposed to obtain the suboptimal solution to the formulated joint optimization problem. Numerical results validate the accuracy and effectiveness of our algorithms as well as the performance of optimizing the total energy consumption compared with the benchmark algorithms.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85146228622&origin=inward,IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology,2023-01-01
Gated Adversarial Network Based Environmental Enhancement Method for Driving Safety Under Adverse Weather Conditions,"The adverse weather conditions have brought considerable difficulties in vision-based applications, which are closely related to the driving safety of autonomous vehicles. However, to date, the greater part of the existing environmental perception studies are under ordinary conditions, and the method to deal with the adverse weather conditions was ignored. Hence, this paper proposes an all-in-one gated adversarial network (AIO-GAN) to improve the performance of vision-based environment perception algorithms under adverse weather conditions, including in rain, haze, lack of light, etc. Three key technical contributions are made. At first, the deep learning based gated transformer module was proposed to classify the input mixed images to different collections by passing them through different branches. Second, the multi-branch based variational autoencoder-generative adversarial network was proposed to solve the ill-pose problem of the solution. Third, high-level weight sharing encoders was given out to guarantee the stability and the high quality of the training process. In this way, the unified clean-style images can be achieved, even if the mixed multi-modal images are transferred from the source domain of complex weather scenes. Extensive experimental results show that the proposed method has achieved better performance than state-of-the-arts and improved the accuracy of target detection.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9677938,IEEE Transactions on Intelligent Vehicles,2023-01-01
Perceptual Interaction-Based Path Tracking Control of Autonomous Vehicles Under DoS Attacks: A Reinforcement Learning Approach,"This paper considers the distributed optimal path tracking control problem of autonomous ground vehicles (AGVs) with matched uncertainties under denial-of-service (DoS) attacks. First, to solve the uncertain system parameters, an inverse reinforcement learning (RL) technique is PROPOSED to seek the optimal controller instead of directly solving the robust control problem, which can ensure that the designed controller is globally optimal with respect to the proposal performance function. An off-policy RL algorithm is further proposed to learn the optimal control solution online without requiring any knowledge of the vehicle dynamics. Then, to lower the communication load among vehicles, a perception-based optimal resilient controller and its corresponding perception-based static deadband condition are developed, respectively. Moreover, the perception-based dynamic deadband control mechanism is further exploited to consider the secure path tracking control problem. The proposed algorithms verify that the RL-based optimal path tracking control can be solved, and the occurrence of the Zeno phenomenon can be avoided. Finally, a numerical simulation is demonstrated to verify the effectiveness of the proposed approach.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85162897678&origin=inward,IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology,2023-01-01
Resilient and Safe Platooning Control of Connected Automated Vehicles Against Intermittent Denial-of-Service Attacks,"Connected automated vehicles (CAVs) serve as a promising enabler for future intelligent transportation systems because of their capabilities in improving traffic efficiency and driving safety, and reducing fuel consumption and vehicle emissions. A fundamental issue in CAVs is platooning control that empowers a convoy of CAVs to be cooperatively maneuvered with desired longitudinal spacings and identical velocities on roads. This paper addresses the issue of resilient and safe platooning control of CAVs subject to intermittent denial-of-service (DoS) attacks that disrupt vehicle-to-vehicle communications. First, a heterogeneous and uncertain vehicle longitudinal dynamic model is presented to accommodate a variety of uncertainties, including diverse vehicle masses and engine inertial delays, unknown and nonlinear resistance forces, and a dynamic platoon leader. Then, a resilient and safe distributed longitudinal platooning control law is constructed with an aim to preserve simultaneous individual vehicle stability, attack resilience, platoon safety and scalability. Furthermore, a numerically efficient offline design algorithm for determining the desired platoon control law is developed, under which the platoon resilience against DoS attacks can be maximized but the anticipated stability, safety and scalability requirements remain preserved. Finally, extensive numerical experiments are provided to substantiate the efficacy of the proposed platooning method.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9878288,IEEE/CAA Journal of Automatica Sinica,2023-01-01
Robust Decision Making for Autonomous Vehicles at Highway On-Ramps: A Constrained Adversarial Reinforcement Learning Approach,"Reinforcement learning has demonstrated its potential in a series of challenging domains. However, many real-world decision making tasks involve unpredictable environmental changes or unavoidable perception errors that are often enough to mislead an agent into making suboptimal decisions and even cause catastrophic failures. In light of these potential risks, reinforcement learning with application in safety-critical autonomous driving domain remains tricky without ensuring robustness against environmental uncertainties (e.g., road adhesion changes or measurement noises). Therefore, this paper proposes a novel constrained adversarial reinforcement learning approach for robust decision making of autonomous vehicles at highway on-ramps. Environmental disturbance is modelled as an adversarial agent that can learn an optimal adversarial policy to thwart the autonomous driving agent. Meanwhile, observation perturbation is approximated to maximize the variation of the perturbed policy through a white-box adversarial attack technique. Furthermore, a constrained adversarial actor-critic algorithm is presented to optimize an on-ramp merging policy while keeping the variations of the attacked driving policy and action-value function within bounds. Finally, the proposed robust highway on-ramp merging decision making method of autonomous vehicles is evaluated in three stochastic mixed traffic flows with different densities, and its effectiveness is demonstrated in comparison with the competitive baselines.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9994638,IEEE Transactions on Intelligent Transportation Systems,2023-01-01
Multi-Modal Sensor Fusion and Object Tracking for Autonomous Racing,"Reliable detection and tracking of surrounding objects are indispensable for comprehensive motion prediction and planning of autonomous vehicles. Due to the limitations of individual sensors, the fusion of multiple sensor modalities is required to improve the overall detection capabilities. Additionally, robust motion tracking is essential for reducing the effect of sensor noise and improving state estimation accuracy. The reliability of the autonomous vehicle software becomes even more relevant in complex, adversarial high-speed scenarios at the vehicle handling limits in autonomous racing. In this paper, we present a modular multi-modal sensor fusion and tracking method for high-speed applications. The method is based on the Extended Kalman Filter (EKF) and is capable of fusing heterogeneous detection inputs to track surrounding objects consistently. A novel delay compensation approach enables to reduce the influence of the perception software latency and to output an updated object list. It is the first fusion and tracking method validated in high-speed real-world scenarios at the Indy Autonomous Challenge 2021 and the Autonomous Challenge at CES (AC@CES) 2022, proving its robustness and computational efficiency on embedded systems. It does not require any labeled data and achieves position tracking residuals below 0.1 m.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=10113239,IEEE Transactions on Intelligent Vehicles,2023-01-01
Cyber Attacks via Consumer Electronics: Studying the Threat of Covert Malware in Smart and Autonomous Vehicles,"In Industry 5.0, man and machine work alongside each other in production, but smart and autonomous vehicles are examples that show this notion is now being extended to the end consumers. In 2015, a Jeep was remotely hacked through its head unit. This incident drew the public attention to vehicles security and showed how entertainment/infotainment consumer electronics can be used to intrude vehicles. In this paper, we study a novel covert attack that can be launched by malwares spreading through Intelligent Transportation Systems, e.g., via consumer electronics. This malware infects a vehicle module, like the Adaptive Cruise Controller (ACC), and manipulates its setting in a way that is not noticeable to human observers, but gives rise to accidents statistics. We show how this is done and analyze the effect mathematically. We also propose a new Intrusion Detection System (IDS) whose architecture is non-disruptive and can be readily adopted by car manufacturers. We evaluate our proposal with real-world datasets. We demonstrate how a malware/attacker can engineer the crash statistics by manipulating the safe distance value in cruise control scenarios. Then, we put an anomaly-based IDS for ACC modules into test and show how it can effectively detect such covert attacks.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85166755736&origin=inward,IEEE Transactions on Consumer Electronics,2023-01-01
A Defensive Strategy Against Beam Training Attack in 5G mmWave Networks for Manufacturing,"Millimeter-wave (mmWave) carriers are an essential building block of fifth-generation (5G) systems. Satisfactory performance of the communications over the mmWave spectrum requires an alignment between the signal beam of the transmitter and receiver, achieved via beam training protocols. Nevertheless, beam training is vulnerable to jamming attacks, where the attacker intends to send jamming signals over different spatial directions to confuse legitimate nodes. This paper focuses on defending against this attack in smart factories where a moving Automated Guided Vehicle (AGV) communicates with a base station via a mmWave carrier. We introduce a defensive strategy to cope with jamming attacks, including two stages: jamming detection and jamming mitigation. Developed based on autoencoders, both algorithms can learn the characteristics/features of the received signals at the AGV. They can be employed consecutively before performing the downlink data transmission. In particular, once a jamming attack is identified, the jamming mitigation can be utilized to retrieve the corrupted received signal strength vector, allowing a better decision during the beam training operation. In addition, the proposed algorithm is straightforward and fully compliant with the existing beam training protocols in 5G New Radio. The numerical results show that not only the proposed defensive strategy can capture more than 80% of attack events, but it also improves the average signal-to-interference-plus-noise-ratio significantly, i.e., up to 15 dB.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85153401857&origin=inward,IEEE Transactions on Information Forensics and Security,2023-01-01
D2D-MAP: A Drone to Drone Authentication Protocol Using Physical Unclonable Functions,"With the continuous miniaturization of electronic devices and the recent advancements in wireless communication technologies, Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs), in general, and Small Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (SUAVs, a.k.a., drones), in particular, are becoming progressively used by the civilian sector within the context of a variety of applications, bringing great convenience to the public. However, due to their resource-constrained nature, risky environmental application, and wireless way of communication, drones are not immune from cyberthreats. As a consequence, the security of drones (SUAVs) has recently gained significant attention by the research community. In particular, when it comes to inter-drone communication. Although traditional cryptographic techniques may provide a certain level of security, they actually constitute a heavy burden on SUAVs due to their resource-constrained nature. In the light of enforcing the security of inter-drone communications, this paper proposes a lightweight drone-to-drone authentication protocol, called D2D-MAP, that uses PUF (Physical Unclonable Function) technology. We design the protocol and evaluate its resilience against various attacks. We use resource-constrained hardware to implement the authentication protocol and perform an evaluation of its performance. We show that the protocol's security and the obtained performance are prominent compared to state-of-the-art authentication protocols, and that they conform to SUAVs security and performance requirements.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85144011346&origin=inward,IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology,2023-01-01
HOOPOE: High Performance and Efficient Anonymous Handover Authentication Protocol for Flying Out of Zone UAVs,"The unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) in military and civilian systems access sensitive data via cellular networks and are ubiquitous. Therefore, the number of handovers may increase, and the process of sharing authentication keys between drones to new drones may be vulnerable to eavesdropping due to the wireless connectivity. For example, a UAV initially served by cell A may be handed over to cell B after a certain point. Therefore, Security and privacy concerns raise if there is a change in the flight path of the UAV due to wide-area connectivity traffic management, including authentication threats as well as the leakage of identity, location, and flying routes. Also, drones are resource-constrained devices that cannot perform extensive operations, leading to the inability to resist drone capture attacks and impersonation attacks. Therefore, this paper presents a high-performance and efficient anonymous handover authentication protocol to secure the drone traveling path. The protocol utilizes the advantages of the AES-RSA algorithm to provide efficient and secure key management and a fast verification and signature generation that speeds up drone authentication. The protocol's security was proved using the formal verification ROR model and automated security verifier ProVerif tool to validate the protocol resistance against various attacks and provided forward secrecy. In addition, the performance of the proposed protocol is evaluated using the OMNeT++ simulator in terms of communication, computation cost, energy consumption, packet drop ratio, end-to-end delay, and throughput. The results showed that the protocol achieves better security, efficiency, and performance than other protocols.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85151492734&origin=inward,IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology,2023-01-01

Secure Operations of Connected and Autonomous Vehicles,"With features of collaborative interaction and autonomous decision-making, connected and autonomous vehicles (CAVs) offer a viable solution for a sustainable and efficient future of transportation. However, with the development of CAVs, questions have been raised about weaknesses in cybersecurity and autonomous driving capabilities. In particular, CAVs provide new opportunities for cyberattackers, posing a significant threat to future road and vehicle data security. Therefore, this paper provides a comprehensive analysis of the cybersecurity environment of CAVs. First, we propose a systematic classification of six security threats from cybersecurity principles: false data, information theft, privilege escalation, block communication, and time delay. We review the cybersecurity environment of CAVs from a lifecycle perspective, covering aspects from development to accident, and present the existing cybersecurity countermeasures. These involve security standards designation, verification and validation of vehicle networks, resilient strategies for self-defined driving, and attack detection and digital forensics.

Anomaly Detection Against GPS Spoofing Attacks on Connected and Autonomous Vehicles Using Learning From Demonstration,"GPS spoofing attacks pose great challenges to connected vehicle (CVs) safety applications and localization of autonomous vehicles (AVs). In this paper, we propose to utilize transportation and vehicle engineering domain knowledge to detect GPS spoofing attacks towards CVs and AVs. A novel detection method using learning from demonstration is developed, which can be implemented in both vehicles and at the transportation infrastructure. A computational-efficient driving model, which can be learned from historical trajectories of the vehicles, is constructed to predict normal driving behaviors. Then a statistical method is developed to measure the dissimilarities between the observed trajectory and the predicted normal trajectory for anomaly detection. We validate the proposed method using two threat models (i.e., attacks targeting the multi-sensor fusion system of AVs and attacks targeting the intersection movement assist application of CVs) on two real-world datasets (i.e., KAIST and Michigan roundabout dataset). Results show that the proposed model is able to detect almost all of the attacks in time with low false positive and false negative rates.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85159656211&origin=inward,IEEE Transactions on Intelligent Transportation Systems,2023-01-01
OQFL: An Optimized Quantum-Based Federated Learning Framework for Defending Against Adversarial Attacks in Intelligent Transportation Systems,"Intelligent transportation systems, especially Autonomous Vehicles (AVs), are emerging as a paradigm with the potential to change modern society. However, with this, there is a strong need to ensure the security and privacy of such systems. AV ecosystems depend on machine learning algorithms to autonomously control their operations. Given the amount of personal information AVs collect, coupled with the distributed nature of such ecosystems, there is a movement to employ federated learning algorithms to develop secure decision-making models. Although federated learning is a viable candidate for data privacy, it is vulnerable to adversarial attacks, particularly data poisoning attacks, where malicious vectors would be injected in the training phase. Additionally, hyperparameters play an important role in establishing an efficient federated learning model that can be resilient against adversarial attacks. In this paper, to address these challenges, we propose a novel Optimized Quantum-based Federated Learning (OQFL) framework to automatically adjust the hyperparameters of federated learning using various adversarial attacks in AV settings. This work is innovative in two ways: first, a quantum-behaved particle swarm optimization technique is used to update the hyperparameters of the learning rate, local and global epochs. Second, the proposed technique is utilized within a cyber defense framework to defend against adversarial attacks. The performance of the proposed framework was evaluated using two benchmark datasets: MINST and Fashion-MINST, where they include images that would be extracted from smart cameras of AVs. This framework is shown to be more resilient against various adversarial attacks compared with peer techniques.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9641742,IEEE Transactions on Intelligent Transportation Systems,2023-01-01
DLTIF: Deep Learning-Driven Cyber Threat Intelligence Modeling and Identification Framework in IoT-Enabled Maritime Transportation Systems,"The recent burgeoning of Internet of Things (IoT) technologies in the maritime industry is successfully digitalizing Maritime Transportation Systems (MTS). In IoT-enabled MTS, the smart maritime objects, infrastructure associated with ship or port communicate wirelessly using an open channel Internet. The intercommunication and incorporation of heterogeneous technologies in IoT-enabled MTS brings opportunities not only for the industries that embrace it, but also for cyber-criminals. Cyber Threat Intelligence (CTI) is an effective security strategy that uses artificial intelligence models to understand cyber-attacks and can protect data of IoT-enabled MTS proficiently. Unsurprisingly, most of the existing CTI-based solutions uses manual analysis to extract relevant threat information, and has low detection and high false alarm rate. Therefore, to tackle aforementioned challenges, an automated framework called DLTIF is developed for modeling cyber threat intelligence and identifying threat types. The proposed DLTIF is based on three schemes: a deep feature extractor (DFE), CTI-driven detection (CTIDD) and CTI-attack type identification (CTIATI). The DFE scheme automatically extracts the hidden patterns of IoT-enabled MTS network and its output is used by CTIDD scheme for threat detection. The CTIATI scheme is designed to identify the exact threat types and to assist security analysts in giving early warning and adopt defensive strategies. The proposed framework has obtained upto 99% accuracy, and outperforms some traditional and recent state-of-the-art approaches.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85148650746&origin=inward,IEEE Transactions on Intelligent Transportation Systems,2023-01-01
The OpenCDA Open-Source Ecosystem for Cooperative Driving Automation Research,"Advances in Single-vehicle intelligence of automated driving has encountered great challenges because of limited capabilities in perception and interaction with complex traffic environments. Cooperative Driving Automation (CDA) has been considered a pivotal solution to next-generation automated driving and smart transportation. Though CDA has attracted much attention from both academia and industry, exploration of its potential is still in its infancy. In industry, companies tend to build their in-house data collection pipeline and research tools to tailor their needs and protect intellectual properties. Reinventing the wheels, however, wastes resources and limits the generalizability of the developed approaches since no standardized benchmarks exist. On the other hand, in academia, due to the absence of real-world traffic data and computation resources, researchers often investigate CDA topics in simplified and mostly simulated environments, restricting the possibility of scaling the research outputs to real-world scenarios. Therefore, there is an urgent need to establish an open-source ecosystem (OSE) to address the demands of different communities for CDA research, particularly in the early exploratory research stages, and provide the bridge to ensure an integrated development and testing pipeline that diverse communities can share. In this paper, we introduce the OpenCDA research ecosystem, a unified OSE integrated with a model zoo, a suite of driving simulators at various resolutions, large-scale real-world and simulated datasets, complete development toolkits for benchmark training/testing, and a scenario database/generator. We also demonstrate the effectiveness of OpenCDA OSE through example use cases, including cooperative 3D LiDAR detection, cooperative merge, cooperative camera-based map prediction, and adversarial scenario generation.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=10045043,IEEE Transactions on Intelligent Vehicles,2023-01-01
Jamming the Relay-Assisted Multi-User Wireless Communication System: A Zero-Sum Game Approach,"Recently, various wireless Internet-of-Things devices and unmanned aerial vehicles have been frequently used to facilitate daily life. On the other hand, they can also pose serious threats to public security if maliciously used. A countermeasure against these threats is to transmit jamming signals to break the communication links between attacker and wireless devices. However, this is not easy since modern multi-device (multi-user) wireless communication systems are smart in avoiding jamming. Moreover, a relay is widely used to improve the jamming resistance. To successfully jam those malicious devices, we consider a jamming and anti-jamming zero-sum game, in which the attacker tries to maximize the sum-rate of a relay-assisted wireless system and the jammer tries to minimize it. Finding the equilibrium is challenging due to its non-convexity and complex structure. We address this problem in two cases. Specifically, in the single-device (single-user) case, we show that putting the whole jamming power to either relay or device achieves the Nash equilibrium. In the multi-device case, an efficient method is developed, which transforms this game into a min-max optimization problem and decouples it into two sub-problems by the hybrid block successive approximation method. The resultant sub-problems are solved by the multi-block alternating direction method of multipliers and the block successive upper-bound minimization method of multipliers, respectively. Then, a stationary point of the original problem can be iteratively achieved. Numerical results demonstrate that the two proposed jamming methods outperform many traditional methods.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85161349626&origin=inward,IEEE Transactions on Information Forensics and Security,2023-01-01
Characterization and Identification of Electrical Tree Growth Stages Inside High-Voltage Cable Insulation,"Formation of microcavities takes place inside high-voltage cross-linked polyethylene (XLPE) cable insulation due to severe electrical and thermal aging, which further act as sources of void discharges and lead to the development of dendritic carbonyl channels, commonly referred to as electrical trees. Accompanied by intermittent partial discharge (PD) activities, the electrical tree growth bridges the entire insulation over time and results in insulation breakdown, which exposes the cable to fatal safety incidents. Therefore, accurately identifying various stages of electrical tree growths is crucial to prevent such safety instances as well as ensure reliable and extended operation of the XLPE cable. To this end, the present study proposes an automated electrical tree growth monitoring scheme employing a customized 19-layer residual neural network (ResNet) model. For this purpose, microscopic images of different tree growth stages inside XLPE insulation samples were acquired at different temperatures (30 Â°C, 50 Â°C, and 70 Â°C) and augmented using a deep convolutional generative adversarial network (DCGAN). Furthermore, using fractal dimension ( ${d}_{f}$ ) of the tree structures, different electrical tree propagation levels were characterized. Finally, different tree growth stages were identified using the proposed 19-layer ResNet model. This approach yielded satisfactorily high recognition accuracies irrespective of varying temperatures, engaging a significantly reduced computational time compared to classical convolutional neural network (CNN) models. This infers its potential application for automated health monitoring of XLPE cable.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85164816501&origin=inward,IEEE Transactions on Instrumentation and Measurement,2023-01-01
Attribute-Based Data Sharing Scheme With Flexible Search Functionality for Cloud-Assisted Autonomous Transportation System,"The existing group public key encryption with equality test schemes could only support one-to-one data sharing and are not suitable for cloud-assisted autonomous transportation systems, which demand one-to-many data sharing. To tackle this problem efficiently, in this article, we put forward the group-attribute-based encryption with equality test (G-ABEET) scheme. The presented G-ABEET allows sensors equipped in vehicles to encrypt traffic data with an expressive access policy before sharing it. Only users with attributes required by the access policy ought to access the shared ciphertexts, thus achieving selective one-to-many data sharing. Meanwhile, the authorized cloud server could provide group users with equality tests over the ciphertexts, realizing ciphertext search ability. Furthermore, with the group mechanism, the G-ABEET scheme could resist offline message recovery attacks. Besides, in the standard model, we give rigorous security proof of the G-ABEET construction. The feasibility and efficiency of G-ABEET are demonstrated by experimental simulations.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85148475230&origin=inward,IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics,2023-01-01
Adaptive Resilient Control for Cyber-Physical Systems Under Cyberattack and Input Saturation,"This article investigates the resilient control problem for nonlinear cyber-physical systems with hybrid cyberattacks and physical constraints, including aperiodic denial-of-service attacks, deception attacks, input saturation, and external disturbances. The underlying system is described by the fuzzy model by decomposing the nonlinear plant into some local linear subsystems. An input saturating integrator and an antiwindup compensator are introduced inside a dynamic output feedback fuzzy controller to handle the input saturation in both amplitude and rate. Within the resulting fuzzy-model-based control framework, a novel adaptive event-triggered-based resilient control method is proposed to ensure that the insecure and imperfect system is stochastically stable with an $H_\infty$ performance level.

A Repeated Unknown Game: Decentralized Task Offloading in Vehicular Fog Computing,"Offloading computation to nearby edge/fog computing nodes, including the ones carried by moving vehicles, e.g., vehicular fog nodes (VFN), has proved to be a promising approach for enabling low-latency and compute-intensive mobility applications, such as cooperative and autonomous driving. This work considers vehicular fog computing scenarios where the clients of computation offloading services try to minimize their own costs while deciding which VFNs to offload their tasks. We focus on decentralized multi-agent decision-making in a repeated unknown game where each agent, e.g., service client, can observe only its own action and realized cost. In other words, each agent is unaware of the game composition or even the existence of opponents. We apply a completely uncoupled learning rule to generalize the decentralized decision-making algorithm presented in [7] for the multi-agent case. The multi-agent solution proposed in this work can capture the unknown offloading cost variations susceptive to resource congestion under an adversarial framework where each agent may take implicit cost estimation and suitable resource choice adapting to the dynamics associated with volatile supply and demand. According to the evaluation via simulation, this work reveals that such individual perturbations for robustness to uncertainty and adaptation to dynamicity ensure a certain level of optimality in terms of social welfare, e.g., converging the actual sequence of play with unknown and asymmetric attributes and lowering the correspondent cost in social welfare due to the self-interested behaviors of agents.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=10122978,IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology,2023-01-01
Intra-Domain Knowledge Reuse Assisted Reinforcement Learning for Fast Anti-Jamming Communication,"The novel technology based on reinforcement learning (RL) is considered as a promising direction to achieve cognitive and even intelligent anti-jamming communication. However, traditional RL converges slowly in the face of huge state-action space, while the performance improvement of deep RL depends on high-cost computing resources. Under unknown and dynamic malicious jamming attacks, it is still a major challenge to realize online anti-jamming communication through fast and autonomous learning. In this paper, we propose a fast anti-jamming scheme based on intra-domain knowledge reuse for distributed wireless networks. First, we introduce the Bisimulation Relation to measure the similarity of different state-action pairs in the communication anti-jamming problem, so as to build a bridge of knowledge reuse between state-action pairs. This similarity stems from the fact that the anti-jamming problem can be divided into two categories according to whether it successfully resists jamming attacks, in which different state-action pairs in the same category have similarities. Then, through the real-time update and reuse of state-action values, each node can independently learn the characteristics of dynamic environment and adjust the transmission strategy quickly, so as to avoid external malicious jamming and internal mutual interference. The simulation results show that our proposed scheme significantly accelerates the convergence speed and improves the network normalized throughput compared with the benchmark against unknown and dynamic jamming, and has remarkable agility and jamming memory.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85162725259&origin=inward,IEEE Transactions on Information Forensics and Security,2023-01-01
Cyber-Physical System-Based Path Tracking Control of Autonomous Vehicles Under Cyber-Attacks,"As one of the typical applications of cyberphysical system (CPS), autonomous vehicles (AVs) are vulnerable to malicious disturbance from cyberattacks while tracking the desired path.

First, the nonlinear state and measurement equations of AVs under cyberattacks are established based on vehicle dynamics model. Second, to improve the robustness of AVs against cyberattacks, sensor redundancy is introduced. A cyberattack detection method is designed by using extended Kalman filter, and the computational complexity of the cyberattack detection method is analyzed. In addition, sensor switching rules are developed to isolate the disturbance of cyberattacks. Then, the control problem of the AVs is formulated based on model predictive control. Input-to-state stability of the control system under cyberattacks is established, and a link between the tolerable attack intensity and the detection thresholds is clearly revealed. Finally, the simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed control strategy.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9889204,IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics,2023-01-01
A Mathematical Modeling of Stuxnet-Style Autonomous Vehicle Malware,"Autonomous vehicles (AVs) have the potential to provide new paradigms to enhance the safety, mobility, and environmental sustainability of surface transportation. However, as vehicles become more computerized and internally interconnected by electronic control systems, their vulnerability to cyber-attacks is a fast-growing concern and a national priority. Evidence from the Internet virus suggests that AVs will have critical challenges posed by epidemic-style malware like Stuxnet. This self-propagating malware is a fast and powerful way of disrupting the AV system and transportation infrastructure. This study presents a mathematical model for Stuxnet-style malwareâs temporal and spatial spread. Taking cues from the field of epidemiology and ecology, the malware will be described as an infectious epidemic to capture the dynamics of temporal and spatial propagation behavior. This study is the first attempt to analyze the spread of Stuxnet-style malware on AVs. The future uses of such a model for the temporal-geographic spread of AVs-based infectious malware are discussed.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85146255088&origin=inward,IEEE Transactions on Intelligent Transportation Systems,2023-01-01
Towards UAV-Based MEC Service Chain Resilience Evaluation: A Quantitative Modeling Approach,"Unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) and network function virtualization (NFV) facilitate the deployment of multi-access edge computing (MEC). In the UAV-based MEC (UMEC) network, virtualized network function (VNF) can be implemented as a lightweight container running on UMEC host operating system (OS). However, UMEC network is vulnerable to attack, which can result in resource degradation and even UMEC service disruption. Rejuvenation techniques, such as failover technique and live container migration technique, can mitigate the impact of resource degradation but their effectiveness to improve the resilience of UMEC services should be evaluated. This paper presents a quantitative modeling approach based on semi-Markov process to investigate the resilience of a UMEC service chain consisting of any number of VNFs executed in any number of UMEC hosts in terms of availability and reliability. Unlike existing studies, the semi-Markov model constructed in this paper can capture the time-dependent behaviors between VNFs, between host OSes, and between VNFs and host OSes on the condition that the holding times of the recovery and failure events follow any kind of distribution. We perform the sensitivity analysis to identify potential resilience bottlenecks. The results highlight that migration time is the parameter significantly affecting the resilience, which shed the insight on designing the UMEC service chain with high-grade resilience requirements. In addition, we carry out the numerical experiments to reveal that: (i) the type of failure time distribution has a significant effect on the resilience; and (ii) the resilience increases with decreasing number of VNFs, while the availability increases with increasing number of UMEC hosts and the reliability decreases with increasing number of UMEC hosts, which can provide meaningful guidance for the UAV placement optimization in the UMEC network.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=10039493,IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology,2023-01-01
CGAN-Based Collaborative Intrusion Detection for UAV Networks: A Blockchain-Empowered Distributed Federated Learning Approach,"Numerous resource-constrained Internet of Things (IoT) devices make the edge IoT consisting of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) vulnerable to network intrusion. Therefore, it is critical to design an effective intrusion detection system (IDS). However, the differences in local data sets among UAVs show small samples and uneven distribution, further reducing the detection accuracy of network intrusion. This article proposes a conditional generative adversarial net (CGAN)-based collaborative intrusion detection algorithm with blockchain-empowered distributed federated learning to solve the above problems. This study introduces long short-term memory (LSTM) into the CGAN training to improve the effect of generative networks. Based on the feature extraction ability of LSTM networks, the generated data with CGAN are used as augmented data and applied in the detection and classification of intrusion data. Distributed federated learning with differential privacy ensures data security and privacy and allows collaborative training of CGAN models using multiple distributed data sets. Blockchain stores and shares the training models to ensure security when the global modelâs aggregation and updating. The proposed method has good generalization ability, which can greatly improve the detection of intrusion data.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85136685290&origin=inward,IEEE Internet of Things Journal,2023-01-01
Federated Imitation Learning for UAV Swarm Coordination in Urban Traffic Monitoring,"The popularization of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) has boosted various civil applications such as traffic monitoring, in which the effective coordination of the UAV swarm plays a significant role in expanding the monitoring range and enhancing the execution efficiency. However, due to the isolated local environments as well as the heterogeneous execution capabilities, it is challenging to achieve highly consistent actions. In this article, we incorporate the federated learning framework with the imitation learning technique to coordinate the UAVs' maneuvers by interactively imitating the leader UAV's operations. During the interagent global model download phase, we utilize the generative adversarial imitation learning (GAIL) model to accurately follow the leader UAV's operations by removing the biased estimates of imitation parameters. While in the intraagent local model training phase, we utilize the self-imitation learning (SIL) model to correct delicate imitation errors by virtue of the follower UAVs' own historical valuable experiences. In order to achieve more efficient distributed parameter interactions, we regularize the federated gradient updates and eventually yield coordinated swarm policies. We evaluate the proposed algorithm in the UAV-based traffic monitoring scenario. Evaluation results demonstrate the superiorities on training and execution efficiencies.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85135225448&origin=inward,IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics,2023-01-01
A Differential Fault Attack on Security Vehicle System Applied SIMON Block Cipher,"With the application of new technologies in vehicles such as wireless communications, microelectronics, Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Autonomous Vehicles (AV), there are lots of embedded hardware and software in vehicles, and so cryptographic technologies such as block ciphers are also applied to the vehicle system to protect its security and privacy. In order to better find potential security vulnerabilities and improve security of the vehicle system which applied SIMON block cipher, in this paper, a novel Differential fault attack (DFA) method is presented. By inducing a random bit fault in  $L^{T-4}$  (the fourth round from the last), we first demonstrate the process of identifying the fault-induced position. Then, on the basis of the determined position, we describe how to retrieve three rounds of keys by inducing only one round of faults. For retrieving the SIMON family, compared with previous DFAs under the random bit fault model, the lowest numbers of fault-induced and fault locations (or rounds) are required by our attack. In particular, when the key words  $m$  is 2 or 3, the proposed attack only needs to induce one round of faults. Finally, we carry out simulation verification and a comparison to illustrate the correctness and effectiveness of the proposed attack.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9740036,IEEE Transactions on Intelligent Transportation Systems,2023-01-01
Robust Localization for Secure Navigation of UAV Formations Under GNSS Spoofing Attack,"Nowadays, aerial formations are frequently employed in outdoor scenarios to cooperatively explore and monitor wide areas of interest. In these applications, the vehicles are often exposed to relevant security vulnerabilities, as, for instance, the alteration of navigation signals from an attacker with map counterfeiting (if not even hijacking) purposes. In this work, we focus on an Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) formation that monitors an area, wherein navigation spoofing attacks may occur. Letting the UAVs cooperate and exploiting the redundancy in the available sensing information, a distributed procedure is proposed to  $i$ ) detect spoofing attacks, and  $ii$ ) support the navigation in adverse conditions. The validity of the designed approach is confirmed by numerical results. Aerial vehicles for outdoor operation are generally endowed with inertial measurements, relative ranging, and GNSS sensing capability. In this work, two cascaded estimation algorithms for concurrent GNSS spoofing detection and localization in a multi-UAV scenario is proposed, to attain robust navigation in areas subject to GNSS spoofing attacks. The attack detection leverages on information theoretic tools to provide a practical threshold test by checking the multimodal measurement consistency. The localization procedures exploit a decision logic relying on measurement reliability to combine information sources that are different in nature, for UAV self-localization in both safe and under-attack conditions.

Deep Learning-Based Anomaly Detection for Connected Autonomous Vehicles Using Spatiotemporal Information,"Although connected mymargin autonomous vehicles (CAVs) hold great potential to improve driving safety and experience significantly, cybersecurity remains a critical concern. As the de-facto standard for in-vehicle networks, the Controller Area Network (CAN) carries messages and commands vital to the operation of the vehicle. However, due to a lack of security mechanisms, intruders are able to conduct devastating attacks on drivers and passengers over CAN. In order to safeguard CAVs, an Intrusion Detection System (IDS) can be deployed to monitor CAN network activities and detect suspicious behavior resulting from an attack. This paper proposes a prediction-based IDS framework for detecting anomalies and attacks on a CAN bus using temporal correlation of message contents. Two candidates are introduced as the prediction module. The first network is an LSTM that predicts time series data separately for each CAN ID, and the second is a ConvLSTM that predicts messages using correlated data of several CAN IDs. An attack is classified according to prediction errors by a Gaussian NaÃ¯ve Bayes classifier. The proposed IDS is evaluated against other state-of-the-art one-class classifiers, including OCSVM, Isolation Forest, and Autoencoder, and three existing works, including ReducedInception-ResNet, NeuroCAN, and CANLite, using a real-world dataset, the Car Hacking Dataset. A comparison between the two suggested architectures and their use cases is given. Compared to baseline methods and related studies, the proposed method is shown to be more accurate and can achieve F-scores and detection accuracy of almost 100%.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=10164214,IEEE Transactions on Intelligent Transportation Systems,2023-01-01
Modeling Human Driving Behavior Through Generative Adversarial Imitation Learning,"An open problem in autonomous vehicle safety validation is building reliable models of human driving behavior in simulation. This work presents an approach to learn neural driving policies from real world driving demonstration data. We model human driving as a sequential decision making problem that is characterized by non-linearity and stochasticity, and unknown underlying cost functions. Imitation learning is an approach for generating intelligent behavior when the cost function is unknown or difficult to specify. Building upon work in inverse reinforcement learning (IRL), Generative Adversarial Imitation Learning (GAIL) aims to provide effective imitation even for problems with large or continuous state and action spaces, such as modeling human driving. This article describes the use of GAIL for learning-based driver modeling. Because driver modeling is inherently a multi-agent problem, where the interaction between agents needs to be modeled, this paper describes a parameter-sharing extension of GAIL called PS-GAIL to tackle multi-agent driver modeling. In addition, GAIL is domain agnostic, making it difficult to encode specific knowledge relevant to driving in the learning process. This paper describes Reward Augmented Imitation Learning (RAIL), which modifies the reward signal to provide domain-specific knowledge to the agent. Finally, human demonstrations are dependent upon latent factors that may not be captured by GAIL. This paper describes Burn-InfoGAIL, which allows for disentanglement of latent variability in demonstrations. Imitation learning experiments are performed using NGSIM, a real-world highway driving dataset. Experiments show that these modifications to GAIL can successfully model highway driving behavior, accurately replicating human demonstrations and generating realistic, emergent behavior in the traffic flow arising from the interaction between driving agents.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9990591,IEEE Transactions on Intelligent Transportation Systems,2023-01-01
LKAT-GAN: A GAN for Thermal Infrared Image Colorization Based on Large Kernel and AttentionUNet-Transformer,"Because thermal infrared (TIR) images are not affected by light and foggy environments, which are widely used in various night traffic scenarios. Especially, thermal infrared images also play an important role in autonomous vehicles. However, low contrast and lack of chromaticity have always been their problems. Image colorization is a vital technique to improve the quality of TIR images, which is beneficial to human interpretation and downstream tasks. Despite thermal infrared image colorization methods have been rapidly improved, the detail blurriness and color distortion in colorized images remain under-addressed. Mostly because these methods cannot effectively extract the ambiguous feature information of TIR images. Hence, we propose a large kernel (LK) U-Net and Attention_U-Net-Transformer (ViT-Based) based generative adversarial network. An LK_U-Net is designed to extract the feature of TIR images. Then, a branch structure composed of Attention_U-Net and ViT-Based can provide the network with semantic information from different perspectives to decode features. In addition, a composite loss function is employed to ensure the network generates a high-quality colorized image. The proposed method is evaluated on KAIST and IRVI datasets. Experimental results demonstrate the superiority of the proposed LKAT-GAN over other methods for the task of thermal infrared image colorization. The code is available at https://github.com/jinxinhuo/LKAT-GAN.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=10153639,IEEE Transactions on Consumer Electronics,2023-01-01
GNSS Spoofer Localization for Vehicles Based on Doppler and Clock Drift Double Difference,"With the development of vehicle navigation, autonomous driving and unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV), increasing spoofing attacks of global navigation satellite systems (GNSS) have emerged towards vehicles, which can mislead users by false position, velocity and time (PVT) solutions, resulting in serious consequences. Spoofer localization is a necessary step to fundamentally address the spoofing attacks. Most of the conventional spoofer localization methods are based on time of arrival (TOA) or time difference of arrival (TDOA), where time synchronization is indispensable and therefore is hard to apply to the existing vehicles equipped with independent commercial receivers. To cope with this problem, in this paper we develop a flexible method for vehicles to locate a stationary spoofer based on Doppler and clock drift double difference (DCDD). DCDD is calculated using Doppler measurements and clock drift solutions of one vehicular receiver and another reference receiver. Generally, Doppler frequency of GNSS signals changes slowly with time, which releases the restriction for high-precision time synchronization. DCDD represents the Doppler frequency caused by the vehicle motion, from which the spoofer position can be estimated. Utilizing DCDD, an iterative weighted least squares (WLS) algorithm is used to solve the spoofer position, and a closed-form initial value is given to improve the convergence rate. We evaluate the localization performance by the derived CramÃ©r-Rao lower bound (CRLB) in the presence of vehicle position and velocity errors.

Reactive Symbolic Planning and Control in Dynamic Adversarial Environments,"Satisfying both safety and reachability requirements in dynamic adversarial environments is very challenging, particularly when little or no information about the dynamics and intentions of the adversarial objects is available. Therefore, this article addresses the problem of path planning and control of autonomous vehicles in a dynamic adversarial reachâavoid scenario with two noncooperative vehicles and their competitive objectives: 1) âreaching a target and avoiding the other vehicleâ for one of them, called attacker, and 2) âprotecting the target and capturing the opponent vehicleâ for the other one, called defender. In the proposed solution, first, a discrete version of the problem is formulated and solved using linear temporal logic, temporal games, and $\mu$-calculus to construct winning discrete strategies that guarantee safety and reachability. A comprehensive discussion on the existence, correctness, and complexity analysis of the solution is also provided. Finally, a novel correct-by-design hybrid controller is designed to generate smooth control signals that preserve the satisfaction of safety and reachability.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85135767596&origin=inward,IEEE Transactions on Automatic Control,2023-01-01
Automatic Model-Based Dataset Generation for High-Level Vision Tasks of Autonomous Driving in Haze Weather,"Improving the performance of high-level computer vision tasks in adverse weather (e.g., haze) is highly critical for autonomous driving safety. However, collecting and annotating training sets for various high-level tasks in haze weather are expensive and time-consuming. To address this issue, we propose a novel haze generation model called HazeGEN by coupling the variational autoencoder and the generative adversarial network to automatically generate annotated datasets. The proposed HazeGEN leverages a shared latent space assumption based on an optimized encoderâdecoder architecture, which guarantees high fidelity in the cross-domain image translations. To ensure that the generated image can truly facilitate high-level vision task performance, a semisupervised learning strategy is developed for HazeGEN to efficiently learn the useful knowledge from both the real-world images (with unsupervised losses) and the synthetic images generated following the atmosphere scattering model (with supervised losses). Extensive experiments and ablation studies demonstrate that training the model with our generated haze dataset greatly improves accuracy in high-level tasks such as semantic segmentation and object detection. Furthermore, one important but under-exploited issue is investigated to find out whether the developed dataset can be a good substitute for the real ones. Results show that the generated dataset has the most similar performance to the real-world collected haze dataset on multiple challenging industrial scenarios compared with prior works.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9964250,IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics,2023-01-01
Lightweight Trustworthy Message Exchange in Unmanned Aerial Vehicle Networks,"Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) networks have huge potential for a variety of military and civilian uses, such as intelligent transportation system, smart city, and so on. The 6th Generation (6G) communication technology is expected to provide 3-Dimensional (3D) wireless coverage and greatly improve the performance of UAV networks. The UAV-to-UAV (U2U) message exchange (or message exchange for short) is an important basis of multi-UAV cooperation. However, due to the unique characteristics of UAV networks, the U2U messages (or messages for short) are vulnerable to both the external and internal attackers. In this work, we propose a Lightweight Trustworthy Message Exchange (LTME) scheme for UAV networks by efficiently aggregating the cryptography and trust management technologies. In the LTME scheme, a centralized Ground Control Station (GCS) periodically updates the reputation levels of registered UAVs (or UAVs for short) and securely distributes secret values to the UAVs. Based on the received secret values, each trustworthy broadcasting UAV can generate its encrypted messages so that only trustworthy receiving UAVs can decrypt them, and each trustworthy receiving UAV can accurately judge whether the received messages and the corresponding broadcasting UAVs are trustworthy in a lightweight manner. Furthermore, we present a simplified LTME (sLTME) scheme and conduct a comprehensive theoretical analysis and simulation evaluation for the LTME and sLTME schemes. The results demonstrate that the proposed schemes can provide rich functionality and strong robustness with low computation and communication overheads, and are significantly superior to the existing schemes in several aspects.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9660778,IEEE Transactions on Intelligent Transportation Systems,2023-01-01
Three-Dimensional Trajectory Design for Unmanned Aerial Vehicle-Based Secure and Energy-Efficient Data Collection,"Fixed-wing unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) provide a practical means for data collection in many Internet-of-Things (IoT) applications. Secrecy and energy efficiency are crucial to the data collection, but have never been well addressed in the lack of appropriate propulsion energy models for three-dimensional (3D) flights of fixed-wing UAVs. This paper delivers a new approach to the joint optimization of the 3D flight trajectory and data collection schedule of a fixed-wing UAV for secure and energy-efficient data collection under an eavesdropping attack. A critical aspect is that we derive a new propulsion energy model for fixed-wing UAVs flying 3D trajectories. By using equivalent transformation, difference-of-convex techniques, and successive convex approximation, we convexify the model and demonstrate its viability to the design of energy-efficient 3D trajectories. Another key aspect is that we further optimize the trajectory and schedule of the UAV for secure and energy-efficient collection of secret data from sensor nodes on the ground. This is non-trivial due to the convexification of the non-smooth secrecy constraints in addition to the new 3D propulsion energy model. Simulations validate the new model and demonstrate considerable energy saving of 3D trajectories, compared to two-dimensional (2D) trajectories optimized based on the state-of-the-art 2D propulsion energy model.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9875063,IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology,2023-01-01
IIDS: Intelligent Intrusion Detection System for Sustainable Development in Autonomous Vehicles,"Connected and Autonomous Vehicles (CAVs) enable various capabilities and functionalities like automated driving assistance, navigation and path planning, cruise control, independent decision making, and low-carbon transportation in the real-time environment. However, the increased CAVs usage renders the potential vulnerabilities in the Internet of Vehicles (IoV) environment, making it susceptible to cyberattacks. An Intrusion Detection System (IDS) is a technique to report network assaults by potential Autonomous Vehicles (AVs) without encryption and authorization procedures for internal and external vehicular communications. This paper proposes an Intelligent IDS (IIDS) to enhance intrusion detection and categorize malicious AVs using a modified Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) with hyperparameter optimization approaches for IoV systems. The proposed IIDS framework works in a 5G Vehicle-to-Everything (V2X) environment to effectively broadcast messages about malicious AVs. Thus IIDS aids in preventing collisions and chaos, enhancing safety monitoring in the traffic. The experimental results depict that the proposed IIDS achieves 98% accuracy in detecting attacks.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=10144487,IEEE Transactions on Intelligent Transportation Systems,2023-01-01
A Multicriteria-Based Forwarding Strategy for Interest Flooding Mitigation on Named Data Wireless Networking,"In wireless networks, the Named Data Networking (NDN) architecture maximizes contentsâ availability throughout multiple network paths based on multicast-based communication combined with stateful forwarding and caching in intermediate nodes. Despite its benefits, the downside of the architecture resides in the packet flooding not efficiently prevented by current forwarding strategies and mainly associated with the native flooding of the architecture or malicious packets from Interest Flooding Attack (IFA). This work introduces iFLAT, a multicriteria-based forwarding strategy for interest FLooding mitigATion on named data wireless networking. It follows a cross-layer approach that considers: (i) the Received Signal Strength (RSS) to adjust itself to the current status of the wireless network links, (ii) the network traffic (meInfo) to detect flooding issues and traffic anomalies, and (iii) a fake Interest Blacklist to identify IFA-related flooding. In doing so, the strategy achieves better efficiency on Interest flooding mitigation, addressing both native and IFA types of flooding. We evaluated the proposed strategy by reproducing a Flying Ad hoc Network (FANET) composed of Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) featured by the NDN stack deployed in all nodes. Simulation results show that iFLAT can effectively detect and mitigate flooding, regardless of its origin or nature, achieving greater packet forwarding efficiency than competing strategies. In broadcast storm and IFA scenarios, it achieved 25.75% and 37.37% of traffic reduction, whereas Interest satisfaction rates of 16.36% and 51.78% higher, respectively.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85139436622&origin=inward,IEEE Transactions on Mobile Computing,2023-01-01
UAV Trajectory and Multi-User Beamforming Optimization for Clustered Users Against Passive Eavesdropping Attacks With Unknown CSI,"This article tackles the fundamental passive eavesdropping problem in modern wireless communications in which the location and the channel state information (CSI) of the attackers are unknown. In this regard, we propose deploying an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) that serves as a mobile aerial relay (AR) to help ground base station (GBS) support a subset of vulnerable users. More precisely, our solution (1) clusters the single-antenna users in two groups to be either served by the GBS directly or via the AR, (2) employs optimal multi-user beamforming to the directly served users, and (3) optimizes the AR's 3D position, its multi-user beamforming matrix and transmit powers by combining closed-form solutions with machine learning techniques. Specifically, we design a plain beamforming and power optimization combined with a deep reinforcement learning (DRL) algorithm for an AR to optimize its trajectory for the security maximization of the served users. Numerical results show that the multi-user multiple input, single output (MU-MISO) system split between a GBS and an AR with optimized transmission parameters without knowledge of the eavesdropping channels achieves high secrecy capacities that scale well with increasing the number of users. Index Terms: UAV-assisted, beamforming, DRL, eavesdropping, MU-MISO, physical layer security, power control, trajectory optimization.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85162721355&origin=inward,IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology,2023-01-01
Secrecy Rate Degradation of Ground-to-Air Collaborative Beamforming Due to UAV Jitter,"In this article, we consider the secure uplink transmissions from ground nodes to an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) receiver through analog collaborative beamforming (ACB). When the location information of the UAV receiver is available, ACB can be realized in a fully distributed manner, since each transmitting node can locally adjust its phase. ACB-based physical layer security (PLS) algorithm, where the virtual antenna array (VAA) elements are randomly selected at each transmit time unit, can effectively protect against eavesdropping attacks by creating artificial noise to the directions except the legitimate receiver (Bob). However, when Bob is mounted on the UAV, it can suffer from array gain loss due to jittering effects caused by airflow turbulence and mechanical vibration. Motivated by this issue, in this article, we investigate the impact of the UAV jitter on the secrecy performance. We derive the theoretical expressions of the secrecy rate both in the absence and presence of the jittering effects. Further, the simulation results show that the ACB-based PLS cannot guarantee non-zero secrecy rate even with the radial distance perturbations on the order of a few centimeters, especially when an eavesdropper (Eve) exists in close proximity to Bob.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85153373503&origin=inward,IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology,2023-01-01
Joint mission and route planning of unmanned air vehicles via a learning-based heuristic,"Unmanned air vehicles (UAVs) have been regularly employed in modern wars to conduct different missions. Instead of addressing mission planning and route planning separately, this study investigates the issue of joint mission and route planning for a fleet of UAVs. The mission planning determines the configuration of weapons in UAVs and the weapons to attack targets, while the route planning determines the UAV's visiting sequence for the targets. The problem is formulated as an integer linear programming model. Due to the inefficiency of CPLEX on large scale optimization problems, an effective learning-based heuristic, namely, population based adaptive large neighborhood search (P-ALNS), is proposed to solve the model. In P-ALNS, seven neighborhood structures are designed and adaptively utilized in terms of their historical performance. The effectiveness and superiority of the proposed model and algorithm are demonstrated on test instances of small, medium and large sizes. In particular, P-ALNS achieves comparable solutions or as good as those of CPLEX on small-size (20 targets) instances in much shorter time.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=10018314,Journal of Systems Engineering and Electronics,2023-01-01
TAGKA: Threshold Authenticated Group Key Agreement Protocol Against Member Disconnect for UANET,"The development of unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) technology has been advancing rapidly and is widely applied in various domains. Compared to a single UAV, the multi-UAV system, known as the UAV Ad Hoc Network (UANET), can collaborate to accomplish complex tasks more efficiently. Due to the UAVs communicating through open wireless channels, they are vulnerable to various attacks. Group key agreement protocols are often used to guarantee the security of UANET communication. However, the high dynamics of UAVs and the instability of the wireless links often result in certain UAVs temporarily losing connection with the group, rendering them incapable of participating in the group key agreement process. Regrettably, existing literature on group key agreement does not consider this issue, which makes them not applicable to UANET. To address this issue, we propose a threshold authenticated group key agreement protocol (TAGKA) that can resist the disconnection of group members. Then, considering that the temporarily disconnected UAVs need to obtain the latest group key after the communication links are recovered, we design a group key recovery protocol. The security of the scheme is proved under the random oracle model. Moreover, formal security verification using the Tamarin and rigorous informal security analysis is also performed. Finally, we use NS-3 to simulate the protocol, and the experimental results show that our protocol can be effectively applied to UANET.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85162904047&origin=inward,IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology,2023-01-01
The Art of Defense: Letting Networks Fool the Attacker,"3D perception of objects is critical for many real-world applications, such as autonomous cars and robots. Among them, most state-of-the-art (SOTA) 3D perception systems are based on deep learning models. Recently, the research community found that 3D object classifiers on point cloud based on deep learning are easily fooled by adversarial point cloud craft by attackers. To overcome this, adversarial defenses are considered the most effective ways to improve the robustness of deep learning models, and most adversarial defenses on point cloud are focused on input transformation. However, all previous defense methods decrease the natural accuracy, and the nature of the point cloud classifiers itself has been overlooked. To this end, in this paper, we propose a novel adversarial defense for 3D point cloud classifiers that makes full use of the nature of the point cloud classifiers. Due to the disorder of point cloud, all point cloud classifiers have the property of permutation invariant to the input point cloud. Based on this nature, we design invariant transformations defense (IT-Defense). We show that, even after accounting for obfuscated gradients, our IT-Defense is a resilient defense against SOTA 3D attacks. Moreover, IT-Defense does not hurt clean accuracy compared to previous SOTA 3D defenses. Our code will be available at: https://github.com/cuge1995/ IT-Defense.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=10130393,IEEE Transactions on Information Forensics and Security,2023-01-01
Secure Data Sharing With Flexible Cross-Domain Authorization in Autonomous Vehicle Systems,"As an increasingly prevalent technology in intelligent autonomous transportation systems, autonomous vehicle platoon has been indicated the ability to significantly reduce fuel consumption as well as heighten highway safety and throughput. However, existing efforts rarely focus on protecting data confidentiality and authenticity in autonomous vehicle platoons. How to ensure secure and high-fidelity platoon-level communication is still in its infancy. This paper makes the first attempt for efficient and secure communication across autonomous vehicle platoons. Specifically, we present PDSM-FC, the first privacy-preserving data share mechanism with flexible cross-domain authorization over distinctive platoons. The key insight of PDSM-FC is the design of a new ciphertext conversion technique, which allows a ciphertext to be easily converted into another type of ciphertext, facilitating efficient access by all entities holding the legitimate authorization. As a result, PDSM-FC can achieve high-fidelity data communication between two unique platoons in ciphertext, so as to complete specific tasks including platoon integration. Rigorous security analysis shows that PDSM-FC is secure against various attacks such as collusion, forgery and chosen-plaintext attacks. Moreover, theoretical evaluation and extensive experiments demonstrate the practicability of PDSM-FC in terms of functionality, storage and computation overheads.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85126539624&origin=inward,IEEE Transactions on Intelligent Transportation Systems,2023-01-01
Time-Sensitive Networking-Driven Deterministic Low-Latency Communication for Real-Time Telemedicine and e-Health Services,"With the convergence of telemedicine and electronic health (e-health) services, Consumer Internet of Things (CIoT) enabled smart healthcare has attracted much attention from researchers. Telemedicine and e-health care can help to eliminate geographical barriers and provide high-quality medicine services. Whereas, deterministic low-latency communication is a major problem in smart healthcare system with commercial network, since the latency can affect the process of diagnosis and treatment while producing inaccuracy. To address this issue, Time Sensitive Networking (TSN) is introduced in this article for bounded low-latency network services. First, we present a Digital Twin based TSN (DTTSN) framework where digital modeling and intelligent simulation are performed under a virtual environment. Second, a digital twin scheduling model is created to predict the forwarding delay. In order to enhance model adaption in different scenarios, cycle generative adversarial network (CycleGAN) is adopted to train the scheduling model. Finally, the optimal routing strategy deduced in digital twin network is fed back to physical network for automated configuration. Simulation results verify that our digital twin network can promote visibility of operations and predictions of physical network scheduling and routing, while optimizing delay and balancing link load.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85161040460&origin=inward,IEEE Transactions on Consumer Electronics,2023-01-01
In-Vehicle CAN Bus Tampering Attacks Detection for Connected and Autonomous Vehicles Using an Improved Isolation Forest Method,"The development and applications of mobile communication technologies in intelligent autonomous transportation systems have led to an extraordinary rise in the mount of connected and autonomous vehicles (CAVs). Ensuring the security of in-vehicle communication data is the basis for the safety of cooperative transportation systems. An in-vehicle controller area network (CAN) bus is an important issue in in-vehicle security, and some hackers have mastered remote vehicle control methods through the CAN bus network. This paper proposes an improved isolation forest method with data mass (MS-iForest) for data tampering attack detection, in which we use data mass instead of the number of divisions and give an anomaly score ranking to quantify the degree of anomalies. This method is promising to be used as part of the intrusion detection system, like a security component in the onboard gateway, which can effectively avoid the data tampering attacks. We compare the proposed method with other anomaly detection schemes based on the data collected from an in-vehicle simulated dataset and two standard datasets. The experiment results show that the proposed method performs better than the other anomaly detection schemes in terms of the area under the receiver operating curve (AUC).",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85121821851&origin=inward,IEEE Transactions on Intelligent Transportation Systems,2023-01-01
Jamming and Eavesdropping Defense Scheme Based on Deep Reinforcement Learning in Autonomous Vehicle Networks,"As a legacy from conventional wireless services, illegal eavesdropping is regarded as one of the critical security challenges in Connected and Autonomous Vehicles (CAVs) network. Our work considers the use of Distributed Kalman Filtering (DKF) and Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) techniques to improve anti-eavesdropping communication capacity and mitigate jamming interference. Aiming to improve the security performance against smart eavesdropper and jammer, we first develop a DKF algorithm that is capable of tracking the attacker more accurately by sharing state estimates among adjacent nodes. Then, a design problem for controlling transmission power and selecting communication channel is established while ensuring communication quality requirements of the authorized vehicular user. Since the eavesdropping and jamming model is uncertain and dynamic, a hierarchical Deep Q-Network (DQN)-based architecture is developed to design the anti-eavesdropping power control and possibly channel selection policy. Specifically, the optimal power control scheme without prior information of the eavesdropping behavior can be quickly achieved first. Based on the system secrecy rate assessment, the channel selection process is then performed when necessary. Simulation results confirm that our jamming and eavesdropping defense technique enhances the secrecy rate as well as achievable communication rate compared with currently available techniques.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=10016623,IEEE Transactions on Information Forensics and Security,2023-01-01
Resilient Event-Triggered Control of Connected Automated Vehicles Under Cyber Attacks,"Dear Editor, This letter contributes to designing a resilient event-triggered controller for connected automated vehicles under cyber attacks, including denial-of-service (DoS) and deception attacks. To characterize the effect of DoS attacks, the effective intervals of the attack are redivided based on the sampling period. Then, a resilient distributed event-triggering mechanism is proposed to compensate for the sabotage of DoS attacks and reduce the amount of transmitted data. Since the communication channel transmits the data only at the trigger instant, deception attacks may occur at this instant and be transmitted to each vehicle in superposition with the normal signal. Therefore, we construct stochastic models satisfying Bernoulli distribution to describe the false information injected by the attackers. Based on the above framework, an attack-resilient control strategy is proposed to resist the impact of cyber attacks. Then, sufficient conditions are established to achieve stability of vehicular platoons, and a co-design strategy regarding the control gain and triggering parameter matrices is given. Finally, the simulation results are provided to substantiate the effectiveness of the proposed method.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85151275043&origin=inward,IEEE/CAA Journal of Automatica Sinica,2023-01-01

Adversarial Attacks and Defenses Toward AI-Assisted UAV Infrastructure Inspection,"Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) have been widely adopted to assist infrastructure inspection tasks, since they have shown their potential to benefit the inspection in terms of efficiency, cost, and safety. To improve the effectiveness of the inspection, there has been a growing focus of recent research in integrating AI techniques into UAV infrastructure inspection and has achieved promising results. However, no prior work has studied whether such integration will also introduce new security concerns, especially considering the existence of potential vulnerabilities in underlying AI models toward adversarial inputs. In this article, we perform the first study to fill this critical gap by identifying and validating the security vulnerabilities of AI models in the context of UAV infrastructure inspection with a focus on bridge infrastructure. To understand the security property of AI-assisted UAV bridge inspection, we design a two-stage approach for the construction of effective adversarial inputs, with which we successfully validate the existence of security vulnerability using dynamic analysis. Spatial constraints, physical limits, and dynamic environmental changes are taken into consideration in our analysis to make it practical in the physical world. Our evaluation results on a real-world data set show that our constructed adversarial inputs can mislead the UAV to miss detecting a significant amount of risk-prone regions by exploiting the identified vulnerability. Based on such an observation, this article also discusses the defenses based on adversarial training to improve the robustness of AI-assisted UAV bridge inspection, which has been demonstrated to be effective according to our experimental evaluation results.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85139404801&origin=inward,IEEE Internet of Things Journal,2022-12-01

Adversarial Attacks and Defenses for Deep-Learning-Based Unmanned Aerial Vehicles,"The introduction of deep learning (DL) technology can improve the performance of cyberâphysical systems (CPSs) in many ways. However, this also brings new security issues. To tackle these challenges, this article explores the vulnerabilities of DL-based unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), which are typical CPSs. Although many research works have been reported previously on adversarial attacks of DL models, only few of them are concerned about safety-critical CPSs, especially regression models in such systems. In this article, we analyze the problem of adversarial attacks against DL-based UAVs and propose two adversarial attack methods against regression models in UAVs. The experiments demonstrate that the proposed nontargeted and targeted attack methods both can craft imperceptible adversarial images and pose a considerable threat to the navigation and control of UAVs. To address this problem, adversarial training and defensive distillation methods are further investigated and evaluated, increasing the robustness of DL models in UAVs. To our knowledge, this is the first study on adversarial attacks and defenses against DL-based UAVs, which calls for more attention to the security and safety of such safety-critical applications.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85114740908&origin=inward,IEEE Internet of Things Journal,2022-11-15
A Secure Sensor Fusion Framework for Connected and Automated Vehicles Under Sensor Attacks,"As typical applications of cyberâphysical systems (CPSs), connected and automated vehicles (CAVs) are able to measure the surroundings and share local information with the other vehicles by using multimodal sensors and wireless networks. CAVs are expected to increase safety, efficiency, and capacity of our transportation systems. However, the increasing usage of sensors has also increased the vulnerability of CAVs to sensor faults and adversarial attacks. Anomalous sensor values resulting from malicious cyberattacks or faulty sensors may cause severe consequences or even fatalities. In this article, we increase the resilience of CAVs to faults and attacks by using multiple sensors for measuring the same physical variable to create redundancy. We exploit this redundancy and propose a sensor fusion algorithm for providing a robust estimate of the correct sensor information with bounded errors independent of the attack signals, and for attack detection and isolation. The proposed sensor fusion framework is applicable to a large class of security-critical CPSs. To minimize the performance degradation resulting from the usage of the estimation for control, we provide an  $H_{\infty }$  controller for cooperative adaptive cruise control-equipped CAVs.

A Pairing-Free Heterogeneous Signcryption Scheme for Unmanned Aerial Vehicles,"During the past few years, as Internet of Things develops rapidly, the applications of unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) technology have been increasingly widely used. Meanwhile, the efficiency and security issues of UAV communication have brought about widespread attention of many researchers in different fields. In an open wireless network, the attacks on UAV communication mainly include eavesdropping, tampering, interrupting, forgery, etc. Signcryption is an appropriate method to address these security problems. However, the existing signcryption schemes are not suitable for UAVs with limited resources and ground station (GS) that needs to process a large number of messages from UAVs. Moreover, in a certain area, UAVs and a GS may belong to different cryptosystems. Therefore, in this article, we came up with a heterogeneous signcryption scheme for UAVs to communicate to a GS (HSC-U2G) without bilinear pairing operation, where UAVs belong to identity-based cryptography (IBC) while the GS belongs to public-key infrastructure (PKI). Moreover, our scheme provides identity privacy for UAVs and supports batch verification for the GS. Using the random oracle model, we demonstrate HSC-U2G can achieve insider security for confidentiality as well as unforgeability. After that, HSC-U2G is compared with several important related works and we provide all experimental results to show the efficiency.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9762807,IEEE Internet of Things Journal,2022-10-01
Research on Third-Party Libraries in Android Apps: A Taxonomy and Systematic Literature Review,"Third-party libraries (TPLs) have been widely used in mobile apps, which play an essential part in the entire Android ecosystem. However, TPL is a double-edged sword. On the one hand, it can ease the development of mobile apps. On the other hand, it also brings security risks such as privacy leaks or increased attack surfaces (e.g., by introducing over-privileged permissions) to mobile apps. Although there are already many studies for characterizing third-party libraries, including automated detection, security and privacy analysis of TPLs, TPL attributes analysis, etc., what strikes us odd is that there is no systematic study to summarize those studiesâ endeavors. To this end, we conduct the first systematic literature review on Android TPL-related research. Following a well-defined systematic literature review protocol, we collected 74 primary research papers closely related to Android third-party library from 2012 to 2020. After carefully examining these studies, we designed a taxonomy of TPL-related research studies and conducted a systematic study to summarize current solutions, limitations, challenges and possible implications of new research directions related to third-party library analysis. We hope that these contributions can give readers a clear overview of existing TPL-related studies and inspire them to go beyond the current status quo by advancing the discipline with innovative approaches.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9542854,IEEE Transactions on Software Engineering,2022-10-01

Blockchain-Assisted Distributed and Lightweight Authentication Service for Industrial Unmanned Aerial Vehicles,"Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) have shown great potential in benefiting industries due to their good features, such as the ease of deployment and low maintenance cost. However, the communication security issue remains a serious challenge before the large-scale application of industrial UAVs. The untrusted communication environment can cause the leakage of valuable industrial data or the losing of important cargos that carried by UAVs. Traditional authentication mechanisms for protecting communications include public-key infrastructure-based, ID-based, and certificateless authentication. These mechanisms rely on a central authority and some of them may introduce high-complexity computation that is not suitable for industrial drones. Therefore, aiming at these challenges, we design a blockchain-assisted distributed and lightweight authentication service for industrial UAVs. The blockchain technology supports the distributed and immutable storage of industrial UAVsâ authentication information, and smart contracts enable convenient operations for drones to acquire or update the corresponding information. Security evaluation demonstrates that our scheme is resistant to various attacks and can guarantee trustworthy communications for industrial drones. Extensive experiments also show that our designed authentication service can not only achieve low computation and communication cost for industrial UAVs but also remain robust even if a small proportion of drones are compromised.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9678341,IEEE Internet of Things Journal,2022-09-15
Machine-Learning-Based 3-D Channel Modeling for U2V mmWave Communications,"Unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) millimeter wave (mmWave) technologies can provide flexible link and high data rate for future communication networks. By considering the new features of three-dimensional (3-D) scattering space, 3-D velocity, 3-D antenna array, and especially 3-D rotations, a machine learning (ML)-integrated UAV-to-Vehicle (U2V) mmWave channel model is proposed. Meanwhile, an ML-based network for channel parameter calculation and generation is developed. The deterministic parameters are calculated based on the simplified geometry information, while the random ones are generated by the backpropagation-based neural network (BPNN) and generative adversarial network (GAN), where the training data set is obtained from massive ray-tracing (RT) simulations. Moreover, theoretical expressions of channel statistical properties, i.e., power delay profile (PDP), autocorrelation function (ACF), Doppler power spectrum density (DPSD), and cross-correlation function (CCF), are derived and analyzed. Finally, the U2V mmWave channel is generated under a typical urban scenario at 28 GHz. The generated PDP and DPSD show good agreement with RT-based results, which validates the effectiveness of proposed method. Moreover, the impact of 3-D rotations, which has rarely been reported in previous works, can be observed in the generated CCF and ACF, which are also consistent with the theoretical and measurement results.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9724219,IEEE Internet of Things Journal,2022-09-15
BDTwin: An Integrated Framework for Enhancing Security and Privacy in Cybertwin-Driven Automotive Industrial Internet of Things,"The rapid development of the automotive Industrial Internet of Things requires secure networking infrastructure toward digitalization. Cybertwin (CT) is a next-generation networking architecture that serves as a communication, and digital asset owner, and can make the Vehicle-to-Everything (V2X) network flexible and secure. However, CT itself can publish end usersâ digital assets to other entities as a service, making data security and privacy major obstacles in the realization of V2X applications. Motivated from the aforementioned discussion, this article presents BDTwin, a blockchain and deep-learning-based integrated framework to enhance security and privacy in CT-driven V2X applications. Specifically, a blockchain scheme is designed to ensure secure communication among vehicles, roadside units, CT-edge server, and cloud server using a smart contract-based enhance-Proof-of-Work (ePoW) and Zero Knowledge Proof (ZKP)-based verification process. Smart contracts are used to enforce rules and regulations that govern the behavior of V2X entities in a nondeniable and automated manner. In a deep-learning scheme, an autoregressive-deep variational autoencoder model is combined with attention-based bidirectional long short-term memory (A-BLSTM) for automatic feature extraction and attack detection by analyzing CT-edge servers data in a V2X environment. Security analysis and experimental results using two different sources, ToN-IoT and CICIDS-2017 show the superiority of the proposed BDTwin framework over some baseline and recent state-of-the-art techniques.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9583667,IEEE Internet of Things Journal,2022-09-15

Towards Lightweight Authentication and Batch Verification Scheme in IoV,"Revolution in the transportation industry was envisioned by self-driving vehicles, with the potential of communication with other vehicles and interaction with other units of the smart environment. With the advent of the Internet of Vehicles(IoV), which is a system that allows communication between vehicles and other static components of the environment and is a convergence of the Internet of Things (IoT), vehicles are considered as an essential part of the network having secure data sensing and processing platforms. Many vehicular ad-hoc networks (VANETs) research focused on the limited set of applications for intelligent transportation systems (ITS) and typically implied safe driving, infotainment, and traffic management. However, it still exhibits an enormous scope of enhancement in various areas of ITS. In this article, we present a new architecture for IoV, keeping in view the different aspects of ITS and discussing how it can mitigate the challenges of secure communication in IoV along with the new visionary solution for authentication. An IoV is highly dynamic, having different topological structures, uneven distribution of nodes, and, therefore, vulnerable to various security and privacy attacks. This article also presents an efficient batch verification scheme having lightweight authentication that uses bilinear map and one-way hash functions to ensure a high level of security within the limited time constraint as compared to single message verification. The proposed scheme has better performance than the existing techniques in terms of computational delay, time complexity, transmission overhead, and energy consumption.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9460793,IEEE Transactions on Dependable and Secure Computing,2022-09-01
Fortifying Smart Transportation Security Through Public Blockchain,"Smart vehicles-enabled intelligent transportation system (ITS) supports a wide range of applications, such as, but not limited to, traffic planning and management, collision avoidance alert system, automated road speed enforcement, electronic toll collection, and real-time parking management, to name a few. However, it suffers from various types of security and privacy issues due to insecure communication among the entities over public channels. Therefore, an efficient and lightweight security mechanism is essential to protect the data that is both at rest as well as in transit. To this direction, we propose a public blockchain-envisioned secure communication framework for ITS (PBSCF-ITS). The proposed PBSCF-ITS guarantees access control and key management among the vehicle to vehicle, vehicle to roadside unit, and roadside unit to cloud server. We analyze the security of PBSCF-ITS to prove its resilience against various types of possible attacks. Furthermore, the performance of PBSCF-ITS with other related competing schemes has been compared. The obtained results illustrate that PBSCF-ITS outperforms the existing ones. Additionally, the pragmatic study of PBSCF-ITS is conducted to check its influence on various network-related performance parameters, like the number of mined blocks and transactions per block.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9709886,IEEE Internet of Things Journal,2022-09-01
Risk Adversarial Learning System for Connected and Autonomous Vehicle Charging,"In this article, the design of a rational decision support system (RDSS) for a connected and autonomous vehicle charging infrastructure (CAV-CI) is studied. In the considered CAV-CI, the distribution system operator (DSO) deploys electric vehicle supply equipment (EVSE) to provide an electrical vehicle (EV) charging facility for human-driven connected vehicles (CVs) and AVs. The charging request by the human-driven EV becomes irrational when it demands more energy and charging period than its actual need. Therefore, the scheduling policy of each EVSE must be adaptively accumulated the irrational charging request to satisfy the charging demand of both CVs and autonomous vehicles (AVs). To tackle this, we formulate an RDSS problem for the DSO, where the objective is to maximize the charging capacity utilization by satisfying the laxity risk of the DSO. Thus, we devise a rational reward maximization problem to adapt the irrational behavior by CVs in a data-informed manner. We propose a novel risk adversarial multiagent learning system (RAMALS) for CAV-CI to solve the formulated RDSS problem. In RAMALS, the DSO acts as a centralized risk adversarial agent (RAA) for informing the laxity risk to each EVSE. Subsequently, each EVSE plays the role of a self-learner agent to adaptively schedule its own EV sessions by coping advice from RAA. The experiment results show that the proposed RAMALS affords around 46.6% improvement in charging rate, about 28.6% improvement in the EVSEâs active charging time, and at least 33.3% more energy utilization, as compared to a currently deployed ACN EVSE system, and other baselines.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9703673,IEEE Internet of Things Journal,2022-08-15
Mitigating Traffic Remapping Attacks in Autonomous Multihop Wireless Networks,"Multihop wireless networks with autonomous nodes are susceptible to selfish traffic remapping attacks (TRAs). Nodes launching TRAs leverage the underlying channel access function to receive an unduly high Quality of Service (QoS) for packet flows traversing source-to-destination routes. TRAs are easy to execute, impossible to prevent, difficult to detect, and harmful to the QoS of honest nodes. Recognizing the need for providing QoS security, we use a novel network-oriented QoS metric to propose a self-enforcing game-theoretic mitigation approach. By switching between TRA and honest behavior, selfish nodes engage in a noncooperative multistage game in pursuit of high QoS. We analyze feasible node strategies and design a distributed signaling mechanism called DISTRESS, under which, given certain conditions, the game produces a desirable outcome: after an upper bounded play time, honesty tends to become a selfish nodeâs best reply behavior, while yielding acceptable QoS to most or all nodes. We verify these findings by Monte Carlo and ns-3 simulations of static and mobile nodes.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9684538,IEEE Internet of Things Journal,2022-08-01
Detection and Blind Channel Estimation for UAV-Aided Wireless Sensor Networks in Smart Cities Under Mobile Jamming Attack,"Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) can be integrated into wireless sensor networks (WSNs) for smart city applications in several ways. Among them, a UAV can be employed as a relay in a âstore-carry and forwardâ fashion by uploading data from ground sensors and metering devices and, then, downloading it to a central unit. However, both the uploading and downloading phases can be prone to potential threats and attacks. As a legacy from traditional wireless networks, the jamming attack is still one of the major and serious threats to UAV-aided communications, especially when also the jammer is mobile, e.g., it is mounted on a UAV or inside a terrestrial vehicle. In this article, we investigate anti-jamming communications for UAV-aided WSNs operating over doubly selective channels in the downloading phase. In such a scenario, the signals transmitted by the UAV and the malicious mobile jammer undergo both time dispersion due to multipath propagation effects and frequency dispersion caused by their mobility. To suppress high-power jamming signals, we propose a blind physical-layer technique that jointly detects the UAV and jammer symbols through serial disturbance cancelation based on symbol-level post-sorting of the detector output. Amplitudes, phases, time delays, and Doppler shiftsârequired to implement the proposed detection strategyâare blindly estimated from data through the use of algorithms that exploit the almost-cyclostationarity properties of the received signal and the detailed structure of multicarrier modulation format. Simulation results corroborate the anti-jamming capabilities of the proposed method, for different mobility scenarios of the jammer.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9634169,IEEE Internet of Things Journal,2022-07-15
Bift: A Blockchain-Based Federated Learning System for Connected and Autonomous Vehicles,"Machine learning (ML) algorithms are essential components in autonomous driving. In most existing connected and autonomous vehicles (CAVs), a large amount of driving data collected from multiple vehicles are sent to a central server for unified training. However, data privacy and security have become crucial during the data-sharing process. Federated learning (FL) for data security has arisen nowadays, and it can improve the data privacy of distribute machine learning. However, the malicious attackers can still be able to attack the training process. Due to the complete reliance on the central server, FL is very fragile. To address the above problem, we propose Bift: 1) a fully decentralized ML system combined with FL and 2) blockchain to provide a privacy-preserving ML process for CAVs. Bift enables distributed CAVs to train ML models locally using their own driving data and then to upload the local models to get a better global model. More importantly, Bift provides a consensus algorithm named Proof of Federated Learning to resist possible adversaries. We evaluate the performance of Bift and demonstrate that Bift is scalable and robust, and can defend against malicious attacks.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9650783,IEEE Internet of Things Journal,2022-07-15
A Lightweight and Privacy-Preserving Mutual Authentication and Key Agreement Protocol for Internet of Drones Environment,"With accelerated advances in various technologies, drones, better known as unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), are increasingly commonplace and consequently have a more pronounced impact on society. For example, Internet of Drones (IoD), a new communication paradigm offering fundamental navigation assistance and access to information, has widespread applications ranging from agricultural drones in farming to surveillance drones in the COVID-19 pandemic. The increasingly prominent role of IoD in our society also reinforces the importance of securing such systems against various data privacy and security threats. Operationally, it can be challenging to adopt conventional off-the-shelf security products in an IoD system due to the underpinning characteristics of drones (e.g., dynamic and open communication channel). Therefore in this article, we propose a lightweight and privacy-preserving mutual authentication and key agreement protocol, hereafter referred to as PMAP. The latter uses a physical unclonable function (PUF) and chaotic system to support mutual authentication and establish a secure session key between communication entities in the IoD system. To be specific, PMAP consists of two schemes, namely: 1)  ${\mathrm{ PMAP}}^{D2Z}$  (that mutually authenticates drone and zone service provider (ZSP) and establishes secure session keys) and 2)  ${\mathrm{ PMAP}}^{D2D}$  (that mutually authenticates drones and establishes secure session keys). In addition, PMAP supports conditional privacy preserving so that the genuine identity of drones can only be revealed by trusted ZSPs. We evaluate the security of PMAP using automated validation of Internet security protocols and application (AVISPA), as well as provide formal and informal security analysis to show the resilience of PMAP against various security attacks. We also evaluate the performance of PMAP through extensive experiments and compare its performance with existing AKA and IBE-Lite schemes, whose findings show that PMAP achieves better performance in terms of computation cost, energy consumption, and communication overhead.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9745033,IEEE Internet of Things Journal,2022-06-15
MD-GAN-Based UAV Trajectory and Power Optimization for Cognitive Covert Communications,"This article investigates the covert performance of an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) jammer-assisted cognitive radio (CR) network. In particular, the covert transmission of secondary users can be effectively protected by UAV jamming against the eavesdropping. For practical consideration, the UAV is assumed to only know certain partial channel distribution information (CDI), whereas not to know the detection threshold of an eavesdropper. For this sake, we propose a model-driven generative adversarial network (MD-GAN)-assisted optimization framework, consisting of a generator and a discriminator, where the unknown channel information and the detection threshold are learned weights. Then, a GAN-based joint trajectory and power optimization (GAN-JTP) algorithm is developed to train the MD-GAN optimization framework for covert communication, which results in the joint solution of the UAVâs trajectory and transmits power to maximize the covert rate and the probability of detection errors. Our simulation results show that the proposed GAN-JTP with a rapid convergence speed can attain near-optimal solutions of the UAVâs trajectory and transmit power for the covert communication.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9584882,IEEE Internet of Things Journal,2022-06-15
Energy-Efficient and Secure Communication Toward UAV Networks,"Wireless networks ensure the unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) communicate and cooperate with each other, which plays an indispensable role among UAVs. The two crucial challenges in UAV wireless networks are energy saving and security. The current lightweight communication approaches lead to insufficient robustness of the encrypted transmission that is insecure. To address this issue, we propose a secure transmission approach with energy efficiency toward UAVs networks. We design a lightweight symmetric encryption algorithm based on SM4 and the relevant key negotiation and update mechanism to protect the confidentiality of communication contents. Moreover, a modified aggregative BLS signature scheme, together with the Merkle Hash tree (MHT), is introduced to guarantee the integrity and authenticity of data packets in transmission. Furthermore, we propose an online/offline revocable identity-based group signature (OORIBGS) scheme and integrate it into our framework for UAV anonymity, traceability, as well as revocability with small key management cost and high efficiency. We give detailed security analysis and prove that our proposal has the properties of data confidentiality, integrity, and authenticity, as well as identity traceability and anonymity. Moreover, we apply our approach in the UAVs networks and evaluate the runtime and anti-attack performance. The experimental results show that the proposed method can be effectively used in UAVs secure communication.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9560132,IEEE Internet of Things Journal,2022-06-15
Blockchain and PUF-Based Lightweight Authentication Protocol for Wireless Medical Sensor Networks,"Due to the emergence of heterogeneous Internet of Medical Things (IoMT) (e.g., wearable health devices, smartwatch monitoring, and automated insulin delivery systems), large volumes of patient data are dispatched to central cloud servers for disease analysis and diagnosis. Although this direct mode brings a lot of convenience for both patients and medical professionals (MPs), the open communication channel between them also incurs several security and privacy issues, such as man-in-the-middle attacks, eavesdropping attacks, and tracking attacks. Based on the unsolved challenges in wireless medical sensor networks (WMSNs), several researchers have proposed various authentication and key agreement (AKA) protocols for this type of healthcare system recently. However, most of these protocols do not perceive physical-layer security and over-centralized server problem in WMSN. In this article, to address these two open problems, we propose a lightweight and reliable authentication protocol for WMSN, which is composed of cutting-edge blockchain technology and physically unclonable functions (PUFs). In addition, a fuzzy extractor scheme is introduced to deal with biometric information. Subsequently, two security evaluation methods are used to prove the high reliability of our proposed scheme. Finally, performance evaluation experiments illustrate that the proposed mutual authentication protocol requires the least computation and communication cost among the compared schemes.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9559388,IEEE Internet of Things Journal,2022-06-01
Autonomous Driving Security: State of the Art and Challenges,"The autonomous driving industry has mushroomed over the past decade. Although autonomous driving has undoubtedly become one of the most promising technologies of this century, its development faces multiple challenges, of which security is the major concern. In this article, we present a thorough analysis of autonomous driving security. First, the attack surface of autonomous driving is presented. After an analysis of the operation of autonomous driving in terms of key components and technologies, the security of autonomous driving is elaborated in four dimensions: 1) sensors; 2) operating system; 3) control system; and 4) vehicle-to-everything (V2X) communication. Sensor security is examined from five components, which are mainly responsible for self-positioning and environmental perception. The analysis of operating system security, the second dimension, is concentrated on the robot operating system. Concerning the control system security, the controller area network is approached mainly from vulnerabilities and protection measures. The fourth dimension, V2X communication security, is probed from four categories of attacks: 1) authenticity/identification; 2) availability; 3) data integrity; and 4) confidentiality with corresponding solutions. Moreover, the drawbacks of existing methods adopted in the four dimensions are also provided. Finally, a conceptual multilayer defense framework is proposed to secure the information flow from external communication to the physical autonomous vehicle.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9625017,IEEE Internet of Things Journal,2022-05-15
Blockchain-Based Cross-Domain Authentication for Intelligent 5G-Enabled Internet of Drones,"While 5G can facilitate high-speed Internet access and make over-the-horizon control a reality for unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs; also known as drones), there are also potential security and privacy considerations, for example, authentication among drones. Centralized authentication approaches not only suffer from a single point of failure but they are also incapable of cross-domain authentication. This complicates the cooperation of drones from different domains. To address these limitations, a blockchain-based cross-domain authentication scheme for intelligent 5G-enabled Internet of drones is proposed in this article. Our approach employs multiple signatures based on threshold sharing to build an identity federation for collaborative domains. This allows us to support domain joining and exiting. Reliable communication between cross-domain devices is achieved by utilizing smart contract for authentication. The session keys are negotiated to secure subsequent communication between two parties.

BCC: Blockchain-Based Collaborative Crowdsensing in Autonomous Vehicular Networks,"The vehicular crowdsensing, which benefits from edge computing devices (ECDs) distributedly selecting autonomous vehicles (AVs) to complete the sensing tasks and collecting the sensing results, represents a practical and promising solution to facilitate the autonomous vehicular networks (AVNs). With frequent data transaction and rewards distribution in the crowdsensing process, how to design an integrated scheme which guarantees the privacy of AVs and enables the ECDs to earn rewards securely while minimizing the task execution cost (TEC) therefore becomes a challenge. To this end, in this article, we develop a blockchain-based collaborative crowdsensing (BCC) scheme to support secure and efficient vehicular crowdsensing in AVNs. In the BCC, by considering the potential attacks in the crowdsensing process, we first develop a secure crowdsensing environment by designing a blockchain-based transaction architecture to deal with privacy and security issues. With the designed architecture, we then propose a coalition game with a transferable reward to motivate AVs to cooperatively execute the crowdsensing tasks by jointly considering the requirements of the tasks and the available sensing resources of AVs. After that, based on the merge and split rules, a coalition formation algorithm is designed to help each ECD select a group of AVs to form the optimal crowdsensing coalition (OCC) with the target of minimizing the TEC. Finally, we evaluate the TEC of the task and the rewards of the ECDs by comparing the proposed scheme with other schemes. The results show that our scheme can lead to a lower TEC for completing crowdsensing tasks and bring higher rewards to ECDs than the conventional schemes.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9515441,IEEE Internet of Things Journal,2022-03-15
Evaluating Adversarial Attacks on Driving Safety in Vision-Based Autonomous Vehicles,"In recent years, many deep learning models have been adopted in autonomous driving. At the same time, these models introduce new vulnerabilities that may compromise the safety of autonomous vehicles. Specifically, recent studies have demonstrated that adversarial attacks can cause a significant decline in detection precision of deep learning-based 3-D object detection models. Although driving safety is the ultimate concern for autonomous driving, there is no comprehensive study on the linkage between the performance of deep learning models and the driving safety of autonomous vehicles under adversarial attacks. In this article, we investigate the impact of two primary types of adversarial attacks, perturbation attacks, and patch attacks, on the driving safety of vision-based autonomous vehicles rather than the detection precision of deep learning models. In particular, we consider two state-of-the-art models in vision-based 3-D object detection: 1) Stereo R-CNN and 2) DSGN. To evaluate driving safety, we propose an end-to-end evaluation framework with a set of driving safety performance metrics. By analyzing the results of our extensive evaluation experiments, we find that: 1) the attackâs impact on the driving safety of autonomous vehicles and the attackâs impact on the precision of 3-D object detectors are decoupled and 2) the DSGN model demonstrates stronger robustness to adversarial attacks than the Stereo R-CNN model. In addition, we further investigate the causes behind the two findings with an ablation study. The findings of this article provide a new perspective to evaluate adversarial attacks and guide the selection of deep learning models in autonomous driving.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9493770,IEEE Internet of Things Journal,2022-03-01
Access Control Protocol for Battlefield Surveillance in Drone-Assisted IoT Environment,"Surveillance drones, called as unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), are aircrafts that are utilized to collect video recordings, still images, or live video of the targets, such as vehicles, people or specific areas. Particularly in battlefield surveillance, there is high possibility of eavesdropping, inserting, modifying or deleting the messages during communications among the deployed drones and ground station server (GSS). This leads to launch several potential attacks by an adversary, such as main-in-middle, impersonation, drones hijacking, replay attacks, etc. Moreover, anonymity and untraceability are two crucial security properties that need to be maintained in battlefield surveillance communication environment. To deal with such a crucial security problem, we propose a new access control protocol for battlefield surveillance in drone-assisted Internet of Things (IoT) environment, called ACPBS-IoT. Through the detailed security analysis using formal and informal (nonmathematical), and also the formal security verification under automated software simulation tool, we show that the proposed ACPBS-IoT can resist several potential attacks needed in a battlefield surveillance scenario. Furthermore, the testbed experiments for various cryptographic primitives have been performed for measuring the execution time. Finally, a detailed comparative study on communication and computational overheads, and security, as well as functionality features, reveals that the proposed ACPBS-IoT provides superior security and more functionality features, and better or comparable overheads than other existing competing access control schemes.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9312672,IEEE Internet of Things Journal,2022-02-15
Fully Onboard AI-Powered Human-Drone Pose Estimation on Ultralow-Power Autonomous Flying Nano-UAVs,"Many emerging applications of nano-sized unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), with a few cm<sup>2</sup> form-factor, revolve around safely interacting with humans in complex scenarios, for example, monitoring their activities or looking after people needing care. Such sophisticated autonomous functionality must be achieved while dealing with severe constraints in payload, battery, and power budget (&#x007E;<b>100mW</b>). In this work, we attack a complex task going from perception to control: to estimate and maintain the nano-UAV&#x2019;s relative 3-D pose with respect to a person while they freely move in the environment&#x2014;a task that, to the best of our knowledge, has never previously been targeted with fully onboard computation on a nano-sized UAV. Our approach is centered around a novel vision-based deep neural network (DNN), called Frontnet, designed for deployment on top of a parallel ultra-low power (PULP) processor aboard a nano-UAV. We present a vertically integrated approach starting from the DNN model design, training, and dataset augmentation down to 8-bit quantization and deployment in-field. PULP-Frontnet can operate in real-time (up to <b>135 frame/s</b>), consuming less than <b>87 mW</b> for processing at peak throughput and down to <b>0.43 mJ/frame</b> in the most energy-efficient operating point. Field experiments demonstrate a closed-loop top-notch autonomous navigation capability, with a tiny 27-g Crazyflie 2.1 nano-UAV. Compared against an ideal sensing setup, onboard pose inference yields excellent drone behavior in terms of median absolute errors, such as positional (onboard: <b>41cm</b>, ideal: <b>26 cm</b>) and angular (onboard: <b>3.7&#x00B0;</b>, ideal: <b>4.1&#x00B0;</b>).

RAMP-IoD: A Robust Authenticated Key Management Protocol for the Internet of Drones,"Internet of Drones (IoD) is the interconnection of unmanned aerial vehicles or drones deployed for collecting sensitive data to be used in critical applications. The drones transmit the collected data to the control room (CR) for analysis, while CR sends control commands to the drone to monitor their operations. This exchange of information between the drones and CR takes place through a wireless communication channel, which is susceptible to various security risks. Therefore, it is vital to ensure the confidentiality and integrity of such information in the IoD environment. To this end, authenticated key management (AKM) protocols can be leveraged to provide reliable and secure communication. However, due to the peculiarities associated with IoD environments, it is challenging to devise a robust and resource-efficient AKM protocol. To tackle this challenge, in this article, we propose a robust AKM protocol for IoD (RAMP-IoD). RAMP-IoD uses lightweight cryptography-based authenticated encryption primitive and elliptic-curve cryptography along with a hash function to perform the AKM process. Moreover, RAMP-IoD verifies the userâs authenticity and then sets up a session key (SK) between the user and a specific drone for indecipherable communications. We verify the security of SK using the random oracle model. Scyther-based validation demonstrates that RAMP-IoD is protected against replay and man-in-the-middle attacks. Moreover, the informal analysis illustrates that RAMP-IoD is secure against various covert security attacks. Through a comparative study, we also demonstrate that RAMP-IoD provides enhanced security with low storage, communication, and computational overheads as compared to related AKM protocols.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9446966,IEEE Internet of Things Journal,2022-01-15
Robust Coordinated Hybrid Source Seeking With Obstacle Avoidance in Multivehicle Autonomous Systems,"In multivehicle autonomous systems that operate under unknown or adversarial environments, it is a challenging task to simultaneously achieve source seeking and obstacle avoidance. Indeed, even for single-vehicle systems, smooth time-invariant feedback controllers based on navigation or barrier functions have been shown to be highly susceptible to arbitrarily small jamming signals that can induce instability in the closed-loop system, or that are able to stabilize spurious equilibria in the operational space. When the location of the source is further unknown, adaptive smooth source seeking dynamics based on averaging theory may suffer from similar limitations. In this article, we address this problem by introducing a class of novel distributed hybrid model-free controllers, that achieve robust source seeking and obstacle avoidance in multivehicle autonomous systems, with vehicles characterized by nonlinear continuous-time dynamics stabilizable by hybrid feedback. The hybrid source seeking law switches between a family of cooperative gradient-free controllers, derived from potential fields that satisfy mild invexity assumptions. The stability and robustness properties of the closed-loop system are analyzed using Lyapunov tools and singular perturbation theory for set-valued hybrid dynamical systems. The theoretical results are validated via numerical and experimental tests.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9345457,IEEE Transactions on Automatic Control,2022-01-01
UAVs-Aided Delay-Tolerant Blockchain Secure Offline Transactions in Post-Disaster Vehicular Networks,"Vehicular networks which are paralyzed by natural disasters is faced with communication dilemma. Through building a decentralized communication network, unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) with high mobility and flexibility are expected to be the solution to the post-disaster vehicular networks. The blockchain technology has been widely used in UAV networks to provision the prompt security of distributed communications. However, existing works ignore the dynamics of the network in that due to high mobility, distributed UAVs cannot timely connect to the backbone to synchronize blockchain transactions. The delay of synchronization can result in severe security issues. On addressing the issues, this paper proposes UAVs-aided blockchain offline transactions to ensure the security and effectiveness of delay-tolerant blockchain transactions when UAVs are offline. In specific, we consider vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) charging transactions in post-disaster vehicular networks. By establishing offline channel between charging and discharging electric vehicles (EVs) by hashed time locked contract (HTLC), we design a UAVs aided penalty algorithm with accountable assertions to prevent deposit forging attacks and double-spending attacks. In addition, considering the selfishness of EVs, a Stackelberg game based incentive scheme is developed to encourage EVs to participate the offline transactions and to improve their trust values. By suing the mechanisms above, our proposal addresses the security of offline EV charging, as well as the selfishness of participant. Using extensive simulations, we demonstrate that the proposed scheme can realize secure transactions among EVs and can effectively improve the utilities of EVs through the comparison with conventional schemes.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9802738,IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology,2022-01-01
A Secure and Lightweight Drones-Access Protocol for Smart City Surveillance,"The rising popularity of ICT and the Internet has enabled Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) to offer advantageous assistance to Vehicular Ad-hoc Network (VANET), realizing a relay nodeâs role among the disconnected segments in the road. In this scenario, the communication is done between Vehicles to UAVs (V2U), subsequently transforming into a UAV-assisted VANET. UAV-assisted VANET allows users to access real-time data, especially the monitoring data in smart cities using current mobile networks. Nevertheless, due to the open nature of communication infrastructure, the high mobility of vehicles along with the security and privacy constraints are the significant concerns of UAV-assisted VANET. In these scenarios, Deep Learning Algorithms (DLA) could play an effective role in the security, privacy, and routing issues of UAV-assisted VANET. Keeping this in mind, we have devised a DLA-based key-exchange protocol for UAV-assisted VANET. The proposed protocol extends the scalability and uses secure bitwise XOR operations, one-way hash functions, including userâs biometric verification when users and drones are mutually authenticated. The proposed protocol can resist many well-known security attacks and provides formal and informal security under the Random Oracle Model (ROM). The security comparison shows that the proposed protocol outperforms the security performance in terms of running time cost and communication cost and has effective security features compared to other related protocols.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85121397641&origin=inward,IEEE Transactions on Intelligent Transportation Systems,2022-01-01
SFNet-N: An Improved SFNet Algorithm for Semantic Segmentation of Low-Light Autonomous Driving Road Scenes,"In recent years, considerable progress has been made in semantic segmentation of images with favorable environments. However, the environmental perception of autonomous driving under adverse weather conditions is still very challenging. In particular, the low visibility at nighttime greatly affects driving safety. In this paper, we aim to explore image segmentation in low-light scenarios, thereby expanding the application range of autonomous vehicles. The segmentation algorithms for road scenes based on deep learning are highly dependent on the volume of images with pixel-level annotations. Considering the scarcity of labeled large-scale nighttime data, we performed synthetic data collection and data style transfer using images acquired in daytime based on the autonomous driving simulation platform and generative adversarial network, respectively. In addition, we also proposed a novel nighttime segmentation framework (SFNET-N) to effectively recognize objects in dark environments, aiming at the boundary blurring caused by low semantic contrast in low-illumination images. Specifically, the framework comprises a light enhancement network which introduces semantic information for the first time and a segmentation network with strong feature extraction capability. Extensive experiments with Dark Zurich-test and Nighttime Driving-test datasets show the effectiveness of our method compared with existing state-of-the art approaches, with 56.9% and 57.4% mIoU (mean of category-wise intersection-over-union) respectively. Finally, we also performed real-vehicle verification of the proposed models in road scenes of Zhenjiang city with poor lighting. The datasets are available at https://github.com/pupu-chenyanyan/semantic-segmentation-on-nightime.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85131187859&origin=inward,IEEE Transactions on Intelligent Transportation Systems,2022-01-01
"Detection and Isolation of Sensor Attacks for Autonomous Vehicles: Framework, Algorithms, and Validation","This paper investigates the cyber-security problem for autonomous vehicles under sensor attacks. In particular, a model-based framework is proposed which can detect sensor attacks and identify their sources in order to achieve the secure localization of self-driving vehicles. To ensure robustness of the vehicle against cyber-attacks, sensor redundancy is introduced, that is to deploy multiple sensors, each of which provides real-time pose observations of the vehicle. A bank of attack detectors is developed to capture anomalies in each sensor measurement, which is a combination of an extended Kalman filter (EKF) and a cumulative sum (CUSUM) discriminator. EKFs are employed to estimate the vehicle position and orientation recursively, while each CUSUM discriminator is designed to analyze the residual generated by its combined EKF to detect the possible deviation of the sensor measurement from the expected pose derived according to the mathematical model of the vehicle. To monitor the inconsistency amongst multiple sensor measurements, an auxiliary detector is introduced which fuses observations from multiple sensors. Based on the results of all the detectors, a rule-based isolation scheme is developed to identify the source anomalous sensor. The effectiveness of our proposed framework has been demonstrated on real vehicle data.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9430762,IEEE Transactions on Intelligent Transportation Systems,2022-01-01
CSG: Classifier-Aware Defense Strategy Based on Compressive Sensing and Generative Networks for Visual Recognition in Autonomous Vehicle Systems,"Visual classification algorithms based-on Deep Neural Networks (DNN) have been widely adopted in autonomous vehicle design. However, DNN suffers from adversarial attacks including pixel attacks and patch attacks, and its adoption may introduce new vulnerability into such security-critical scenarios. Existing defense techniques only focus on defending against one category, either pixel attacks or patch attacks, but does not translate to the other. Hence, the design of a practical comprehensive real-time defense algorithm for DNN-based classifiers presents a challenging task in this adversarial context. This paper attempts to address the abovementioned problem by combining Compressive Sensing with Generative neural networks (CSG) to construct an efficient defense framework, in conjunction with the proposal of a classifier-aware adversarial training way. Extensive experiments have been conducted using the LISA road sign dataset to evaluate the performance of CSG. The results show its superiority in comprehensively defending adversarial examples generated using attacks including CW-L2, FGSM and Sticker, compared with other state-of-the-art defense techniques.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9713747,IEEE Transactions on Intelligent Transportation Systems,2022-01-01
A Systematic Solution of Human Driving Behavior Modeling and Simulation for Automated Vehicle Studies,"Though automated vehicles (AVs) are believed to play a crucial role in future transport, human driving vehicles will share the road with automated vehicles for a relatively long period. So, we need to enable automated vehicles to run along with human drivers especially when they may have conflicts in the right of way. One key problem is how to appropriately model human driving behaviors and quickly simulate their actions when training/testing automated vehicles. Many existing models were originally built for traffic flow studies and may not be suitable for automated vehicles studies. In this paper, we propose a set of new principles of human driving behaviors modeling and simulations. Then, we propose a Data-Driven Simulator (D2Sim) model for human behavior learning, description, and vehicle interaction simulation. In contrast to conventional microscopic traffic flow models, the D2Sim is a trajectory generation model that accepts rich driving environment information (e.g., lane geometry, crosswalks, traffic signals, surrounding vehicles, etc.). Different from many empirical trajectory records replay models, we can arbitrarily set the long-term intentions of the simulated vehicles and intentionally design the corner cases that had not been observed in practice. In addition, the D2Sim adopts adversarial learning to comprehend complex yet stochastic human driving behaviors from empirical data. Testing results show that the proposed model can quickly generate high-resolution trajectory data for training and testing.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9767202,IEEE Transactions on Intelligent Transportation Systems,2022-01-01
Countering Adversarial Attacks on Autonomous Vehicles Using Denoising Techniques: A Review,"The evolution of automotive technology will eventually permit the automated driving system on the vehicle to handle all circumstances. Human occupants will be just passengers. This poses security issues that need to be addressed. This paper has two aims. The first one investigates strategies for robustifying scene analysis of adversarial road scenes. A taxonomy of the defense mechanisms for countering adversarial perturbations is initially presented, classifying those mechanisms in three major categories: those that modify the data, those that propose adding extra models, and those that focus on modifying the models deployed for scene analysis. Motivated by the limited number of surveys in the first category, we further analyze the approaches that utilize input transformation operations as countermeasures, further classifying them in supervised and unsupervised methods and highlighting both their strengths and weaknesses. The second aim of this paper is to publish CarlaScenes dataset produced using the CARLA simulator. An extensive evaluation study, on CarlaScenes, is performed testing the supervised deep learning approaches that have been either proposed for image restoration or adversarial noise removal. The study presents insights on the robustness of the aforementioned approaches in mitigating adversarial attacks in scene analysis operations.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9678365,IEEE Open Journal of Intelligent Transportation Systems,2022-01-01
Unmanned Ground Vehicle Platooning Under Cyber Attacks: A Human-Robot Interaction Framework,"In this paper, we propose a human-robot interaction (HRI) framework to reduce the vulnerability of an unmanned ground vehicle (UGV) platoon under cyber attacks. An observer-based autonomous resilient control strategy is first designed to mitigate the effects of vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) cyber attacks. Rigorous proof of the safety conditions of the platoon under V2V cyber attacks is derived. Next, to facilitate human supervision in emergencies and uncertainties, a decision-making aid system is developed, which consists of an anomaly reporting system (ARS), a trust-based information management system (TIMS), and a graphical user interface (GUI). ARS is designed to detect the abnormality of the neighbor UGVs based on the model-based residual generation and analysis. TIMS is developed to rule out information with low trustworthiness, which is fulfilled by a Bayesian-based information pre-processor followed by an enhanced median filter with trustworthiness regulation. It is rigorously proved that TIMS can recover the tempered information under the mild cyber attack scenario autonomously. To deal with unexpected severe vehicle-to-cloud (V2C) cyber attacks, human observations can also be leveraged to bolster the resilience of the TIMS. Representative simulation and humans-in-the-loop experiment (fulfilled by the designed GUI) demonstrate that the proposed framework can effectively guide human operators when working with UGV platoons under cyber attacks. On average, compared to a multi-screen surveillance benchmark approach, the proposed framework can achieve 78.4% decrements of platoon vulnerability and 39.0% decrements in human workload.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9716850,IEEE Transactions on Intelligent Transportation Systems,2022-01-01

Daedalus: Breaking Nonmaximum Suppression in Object Detection via Adversarial Examples,"This article demonstrates that nonmaximum suppression (NMS), which is commonly used in object detection (OD) tasks to filter redundant detection results, is no longer secure. Considering that NMS has been an integral part of OD systems, thwarting the functionality of NMS can result in unexpected or even lethal consequences for such systems. In this article, an adversarial example attack that triggers malfunctioning of NMS in OD models is proposed. The attack, namely, Daedalus, compresses the dimensions of detection boxes to evade NMS. As a result, the final detection output contains extremely dense false positives. This can be fatal for many OD applications, such as autonomous vehicles and surveillance systems. The attack can be generalized to different OD models, such that the attack cripples various OD applications. Furthermore, a way of crafting robust adversarial examples is developed by using an ensemble of popular detection models as the substitutes. Considering the pervasive nature of model reuse in real-world OD scenarios, Daedalus examples crafted based on an ensemble of substitutes can launch attacks without knowing the parameters of the victim models. The experimental results demonstrate that the attack effectively stops NMS from filtering redundant bounding boxes. As the evaluation results suggest, Daedalus increases the false positive rate in detection results to 99.9% and reduces the mean average precision scores to 0, while maintaining a low cost of distortion on the original inputs. It also demonstrates that the attack can be practically launched against real-world OD systems via printed posters.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9313033,IEEE Transactions on Cybernetics,2022-01-01
A Survey on Attack Detection and Resilience for Connected and Automated Vehicles: From Vehicle Dynamics and Control Perspective,"Recent advances in attack/anomaly detection and resilience strategies for connected and automated vehicles (CAVs) are reviewed from vehicle dynamics and control perspective. Compared to traditional vehicles, CAVs are featured in the increasing number of perception sensors, advanced intra-vehicle communication technologies, capabilities of driving automation and connectivity between single vehicles. These features bring about safety issues which are not encountered in traditional vehicle systems. One main type of these issues is the attack or anomaly launched onto the perception sensors and the communication channels. With such a consideration, this survey summarizes and reviews the existing results on attack/anomaly detection and resilience of CAVs in control frameworks. This paper reviews the results according to the positions at which the attacks/anomalies occur. These positions are divided into three categories, namely, intra-vehicle communication network, perception sensors and inter-vehicle communication network. From this perspective, the recent attack/anomaly detection and resilience results are reviewed according to different positions attacked.

MTH-IDS: A Multitiered Hybrid Intrusion Detection System for Internet of Vehicles,"Modern vehicles, including connected vehicles and autonomous vehicles, nowadays involve many electronic control units connected through intravehicle networks (IVNs) to implement various functionalities and perform actions. Modern vehicles are also connected to external networks through vehicle-to-everything technologies, enabling their communications with other vehicles, infrastructures, and smart devices. However, the improving functionality and connectivity of modern vehicles also increase their vulnerabilities to cyber-attacks targeting both intravehicle and external networks due to the large attack surfaces. To secure vehicular networks, many researchers have focused on developing intrusion detection systems (IDSs) that capitalize on machine learning methods to detect malicious cyber-attacks. In this article, the vulnerabilities of intravehicle and external networks are discussed, and a multitiered hybrid IDS that incorporates a signature-based IDS and an anomaly-based IDS is proposed to detect both known and unknown attacks on vehicular networks. Experimental results illustrate that the proposed system can detect various types of known attacks with 99.99% accuracy on the CAN-intrusion-dataset representing the IVN data and 99.88% accuracy on the CICIDS2017 data set illustrating the external vehicular network data. For the zero-day attack detection, the proposed system achieves high F1-scores of 0.963 and 0.800 on the above two data sets, respectively. The average processing time of each data packet on a vehicle-level machine is less than 0.6 ms, which shows the feasibility of implementing the proposed system in real-time vehicle systems.

Secure Privacy-Preserving V2V Communication in 5G-V2X Supporting Network Slicing,"As autonomous driving technology continues to develop, communication for vehicles is becoming more important to provide an efficient and secure driving environment. Currently, vehicle-to-everything (V2X) based on fifth-generation (5G) is the only solution to meet the demanding requirements of self-driving cars in terms of ultra-low latency and ultra-high reliable connectivity under high mobility conditions, earning this technology more attention. Secure communication for vehicle-to-vehicle based on 5G (5G-V2V) is essential because vehicles decide how to maneuver and perceive situations based on the data exchanged. In this paper, we not only propose a new architecture for V2X based on 5G (5G-V2X) by utilizing network slicing (NS) to guarantee different features of V2X services but also analyze security requirements according to V2X service type. We also propose a secure V2V communication scheme based on 5G that satisfies these requirements. The security evaluation demonstrates that our scheme is secure against attacks on a V2V environment via both security proof and verification tool ProVerif.

Graph-Based Intrusion Detection System for Controller Area Networks,"The controller area network (CAN) is the most widely used intra-vehicular communication network in the automotive industry. Because of its simplicity in design, it lacks most of the requirements needed for a security-proven communication protocol. However, a safe and secured environment is imperative for autonomous as well as connected vehicles. Therefore CAN security is considered one of the important topics in the automotive research community. In this article, we propose a four-stage intrusion detection system that uses the chi-squared method and can detect any kind of strong and weak cyber attacks in a CAN. This work is the first-ever graph-based defense system proposed for the CAN. Our experimental results show that we have a very low 5.26% misclassification for denial of service (DoS) attack, 10% misclassification for fuzzy attack, 4.76% misclassification for replay attack, and no misclassification for spoofing attack.

Intelligent Event-Based Fuzzy Dynamic Positioning Control of Nonlinear Unmanned Marine Vehicles Under DoS Attack,"This article addresses the dynamic positioning control problem of a nonlinear unmanned marine vehicle (UMV) system subject to network communication constraints and deny-of-service (DoS) attack, where the dynamics of UMV are described by a TakagiâSugeno (T-S) fuzzy system (TSFS). In order to save limited communication resource, a new intelligent event-triggering mechanism is proposed, in which the event triggering threshold is optimized by a  $Q$ -learning algorithm. Then, a switched system approach is proposed to deal with the aperiodic DoS attack occurring in the communication channels. With a proper piecewise Lyapunov function, some sufficient conditions for global exponential stability (GES) of the closed-loop nonlinear UMV system are derived, and the corresponding observer and controller gains are designed via solving a set of matrix inequalities. A benchmark nonlinear UMV system is adopted as an example in simulation, and the simulation results validate the effectiveness of the proposed control method.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9635711,IEEE Transactions on Cybernetics,2022-01-01
Accelerating Monte Carlo Bayesian Prediction via Approximating Predictive Uncertainty Over the Simplex,"Estimating the predictive uncertainty of a Bayesian learning model is critical in various decision-making problems, e.g., reinforcement learning, detecting the adversarial attack, self-driving car. As the model posterior is almost always intractable, most efforts were made on finding an accurate approximation to the true posterior. Even though a decent estimation of the model posterior is obtained, another approximation is required to compute the predictive distribution over the desired output. A common accurate solution is to use Monte Carlo (MC) integration. However, it needs to maintain a large number of samples, and evaluate the model repeatedly, and average multiple model outputs. In many real-world cases, this is computationally prohibitive. In this work, assuming that the exact posterior or a decent approximation is obtained, we propose a generic framework to approximate the output probability distribution induced by the model posterior with a parameterized model and in an amortized fashion. The aim is to approximate the predictive uncertainty of a specific Bayesian model, meanwhile alleviating the heavy workload of MC integration at testing time. The proposed method is universally applicable to Bayesian classification models that allow for posterior sampling. Theoretically, we show that the idea of amortization incurs no additional costs on approximation performance. Empirical results validate the strong practical performance of our approach.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9305977,IEEE Transactions on Neural Networks and Learning Systems,2022-01-01
Smart Card-Based Identity Management Protocols for V2V and V2I Communications in CCAM: A Systematic Literature Review,"Besides developing new Cooperative, Connected and Automated Mobility (CCAM) services for the improvement of road safety and travel experience, researchers are considering protection mechanisms to ensure the security of these services and the safety of involved users (drivers but also, e.g., cyclists and pedestrians). In particular, several Identity Management (IDM) protocols have been designed as the first line of defence against external attackers. Among these protocols, a promising trend in research consists in the use of a Smart Card (SC) as a technical enabler for strong authentication. Indeed, many SC-based IDM protocols for Vehicle-to-Vehicle (V2V) and Vehicle-to-Infrastructure (V2I) communications in real-time CCAM services have been proposed in the literature which present interesting features and promising usability experimental results. However, this research line is far from being exhausted, especially considering the recent spread of SC technologies and use cases. For this reason, in this paper we propose a systematic literature review on SC-based IDM protocols for real-time CCAM services. In particular, we identify characterising assumptions of CCAM scenarios and extrapolate a unified high-level view of the steps composing a SC-based IDM protocol. Then, we present a detailed survey of several SC-based IDM protocols. Finally, we identify trends in research and formulate guidelines and useful recommendations to provide a solid base which researchers can use as a starting point for the design of new and improved SC-based IDM protocols for CCAM scenarios.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9576545,IEEE Transactions on Intelligent Transportation Systems,2022-01-01
Detection of Nonrandom Sign-Based Behavior for Resilient Coordination of Robotic Swarms,"Cooperative multirobot systems coordinate their motion by exchanging information through consensus schemes to achieve a common goal. In the event of stealthy cyber attacks, compromised measurements and communication broadcasts can hijack a portion or the entire system toward undesired states. However, in order for these attacks to be effective, they have to exhibit nonrandom characteristics that contradict the expected multirobot system behavior. To deal with these hidden attacks, we propose a runtime monitoring framework that considers the signed residual, defined as the difference between the expected and the received information to identify and isolate unexpected nonrandom behavior within the multirobot system. Specifically, the technique that we proposeânamed Cumulative Sign detectorâmonitors and compares changes in signed values of residual with their expected occurrences to detect inconsistencies and trigger alarms when an attack is discovered. Our results are validated theoretically by providing detection bounds and are demonstrated with simulations and experiments on swarms of unmanned ground vehicles under different attacks in comparison with state-of-the-art residual-based detection schemes.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9686360,IEEE Transactions on Robotics,2022-01-01
Location-Based Schemes for Mitigating Cyber Threats on Connected and Automated Vehicles: A Survey and Design Framework,"The increased automation and connectivity of vehicles and road infrastructure can make future transportation systems more efficient and smarter and enable new transportation business models. Connected and automated vehicles (CAVs) may form a group of autonomous fleets to transform todayâs shared mobility services and also play the role of mobile sensors, which share real-time traffic and road information for transportation management. However, these technological advancements also lead to new cyber and physical threats that cause safety hazards or other undesired consequences. Although there have been a large number of papers about identifying and mitigating each type of threat, the lack of design support still challenges security engineering for developing CAVs. This limits the engineering capabilities of original equipment manufacturers to prioritize among multiple system properties, including safety, security, and privacy, and dealing with ever-changing attack surfaces and the power of attackers. This paper surveys security vulnerabilities and defense mechanisms for CAVs from an engineering design perspective. We illustrate how to identify and mitigate physical threats that compromise the safety of individual vehicles and cyber threats that disrupt newly CAV-enabled transportation services in a systematic way. An integrated security engineering process and a multi-layer design framework are presented for providing traceability and guidance in threat identification and mitigation.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9284448,IEEE Transactions on Intelligent Transportation Systems,2022-01-01
AUV-Aided Data Importance Based Scheme for Protecting Location Privacy in Smart Ocean,"Data collection in underwater acoustic sensor networks (UASNs) and the exposure of node location information pose a threat to the security of the entire network. Therefore, the main challenge for underwater acoustic sensor network security is to protect the security and privacy of the node locations. Compared to active attacks, the characteristics of passive attacks are indistinguishable. Therefore, this research focuses on passive attacks in underwater acoustic sensor networks, and an autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV)-aided data-importance-based scheme for protecting location privacy (DIS-PLP) is proposed. The DIS-PLP comprises three main parts. First, the anchor node calculates the importance of the current data based on the historical dataset and decides whether to send data packets to the base station according to the importance result. Subsequently, an AUV privacy violation is defined, and an AUV path planning method is proposed to prevent attackers from tracking the AUV to obtain the location of the source node. Finally, to prevent nodes from waiting too long for AUVs, a secure multi-hop transmission method is proposed that uses fake source nodes to send fake source data packets to hide the real traffic. The simulation results show that the DIS-PLP offers well performance in terms of safety time and delay, which has strong practical significance for Smart Ocean to improve the level of network security.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85139432019&origin=inward,IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology,2022-01-01
A Push-Based Probabilistic Method for Source Location Privacy Protection in Underwater Acoustic Sensor Networks,"As the research topics in ocean emerge, underwater acoustic sensor networks (UASNs) have become ever more relevant. Consequently, challenges arise with the security and privacy of the UASNs. Compared to the active attacks, the characteristics of passive attacks are more difficult to discriminate. Thus, the focus of this study is on the passive attacks in UASNs, where a push-based probabilistic method for source location privacy protection (PP-SLPP) is proposed. The fake packet technology and the multipath technology are utilized in the PP-SLPP scheme to counter the passive attacks, so as to protect the source location privacy in UASNs. Moreover, the Ekman drift current model is employed to simulate the underwater environment. And the mean shift algorithm and the k-means algorithm are adopted in the dynamic layer and static layer of the Ekman drift current model, respectively, to increase the stability of the clusters. Finally, an autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV) swarm is implemented to collect data in clusters. Through the comparison with existing data collection schemes in UASNs, the simulation results have demonstrated that the PP-SLPP scheme can achieve a longer safety period, with a minor compromise of energy consumption and delay.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9446512,IEEE Internet of Things Journal,2022-01-01
Resilient Branching MPC for Multi-Vehicle Traffic Scenarios Using Adversarial Disturbance Sequences,"An approach to resilient planning and control of autonomous vehicles in multi-vehicle traffic scenarios is proposed. The proposed method is based on model predictive control (MPC), where alternative predictions of the surrounding traffic are determined automatically such that they are intentionally adversarial to the ego vehicle. This provides robustness against the inherent uncertainty in traffic predictions. To reduce conservatism, an assumption that other agents are of no ill intent is formalized. Simulation results from highway driving scenarios show that the proposed method in real-time negotiates traffic situations out of scope for a nominal MPC approach and performs favorably to state-of-the-art reinforcement-learning approaches without requiring prior training. The results also show that the proposed method performs effectively, with the ability to prune disturbance sequences with a lower risk for the ego vehicle.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85128678443&origin=inward,IEEE Transactions on Intelligent Vehicles,2022-01-01
Game Theoretic Physical Layer Authentication for Spoofing Detection in UAV Communications,"In this paper, we propose a game theoretic framework for secure physical layer authentication (PLA) by applying the spatial correlations of received signal strength (RSS) in the air-to-ground channels between an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV), a legitimate transmitter, and a spoofer. Based on our hypothesis model, we first derive the false alarm rate and miss detection rate for the UAV receiver. We then formulate a zero-sum PLA game where the UAV receiver selects its RSS detection threshold while the spoofer selects its attack probability to maximize their respective utilities. We derive the Nash equilibrium (NE) and its existence condition for the proposed PLA game. Monte Carlo simulation results accurately verify our analytical expressions for the false alarm rate and miss detection rate. Numerical results highlight the complex interplay between the detection threshold, spoofing attack probability and UAV altitude in the derived NE.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9739860,IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology,2022-01-01
Event-Triggered Adaptive Formation Keeping and Interception Scheme for Autonomous Surface Vehicles Under Malicious Attacks,"In leader-following formation, the leader plays a central role and is more vulnerable to malicious attacks. To effectively protect the leader, this article investigates an event-based formation control problem of autonomous surface vehicles (ASVs) with multiple attackers and actuator failure. A novel adaptive formation keeping and interception scheme is developed for ASVs. In this scheme, a formation keeping controller and an interception controller are designed under a unified framework by sharing same event-triggered mechanism and fault-tolerant structure. To bridge these two controllers, a degree and distance driven formation interception ($\text{D}^3$FI) strategy is designed by generating defenders. It is shown that with the proposed scheme, all attackers are intercepted without affecting formation keeping of remaining ASVs if the original topology is connected. Advantages of our scheme are: 1) stable controller switching is ensured during the formation cooperation and 2) the fault-tolerance is obtained with lower actuator updating frequencies and least number of adaptive parameters for each ASV.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9534686,IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics,2022-01-01
A Privacy-Preserving-Based Secure Framework Using Blockchain-Enabled Deep-Learning in Cooperative Intelligent Transport System,"Cooperative Intelligent Transport System (C-ITS) is a promising technology that aims to improve the traditional transport management systems. In C-ITS infrastructure Autonomous Vehicles (AVs) communicate wirelessly with other AVs, Road Side Units (RSUs) and Traffic Command Centres (TCCs) using an open channel Internet. However, the use of the Internet brings inherent vulnerabilities related to privacy (e.g., adversary performing inference and data poisoning attacks), and security (e.g., AVs can be compromised using advanced hacking techniques) issues and prevents the faster realization of C-ITS applications. To address these challenges, this paper presents a privacy-preserving-based secure framework to provide both privacy and security in C-ITS infrastructure. The proposed framework provides two level of security and privacy using blockchain and deep learning modules. First, a blockchain module is designed to securely transmit the C-ITS data between AVsâRSUs-TCCs, and a smart contract-based enhanced Proof of Work (ePoW) technique is designed to verify data integrity and mitigate data poisoning attacks. Second, a deep-learning module is designed that includes Long-Short Term Memory-AutoEncoder (LSTM-AE) technique for encoding C-ITS data into a new format to prevent inference attacks. The encoded data is used by the proposed Attention-based Recurrent Neural Network (A-RNN), for intrusive events recognition in C-ITS infrastructure. The proposed A-RNN is trained using Truncated Backpropagation Through Time (BPTT) algorithm. The framework is further validated and tested using two publicly available ToN-IoT and CICIDS-2017 datasets. The proposed framework is compared with peer privacy-preserving intrusion detection techniques, and the result shows the effectiveness of the proposed framework over several state-of-the-art techniques in both blockchain and non-blockchain systems.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9505613,IEEE Transactions on Intelligent Transportation Systems,2022-01-01
Measurement-Based Optimal Stealthy Attacks on Remote State Estimation,"This paper focuses on designing measurement-based optimal stealthy attacks for linear cyber-physical systems (CPSs), where attackers aim to deteriorate the performance of remote state estimation and keep  $\epsilon $ -stealthy to Kullback-Leibler divergence detector. Instead of constructing a linear attack directly, we consider a more general attack model with an arbitrary distribution to reveal the correlations between attacks and the stealth level  $\epsilon $ . By solving a convex optimization problem, the mean and variance of optimal attacks on common unprotected systems are obtained. Not limited to zero mean Gaussian attacks, the derived optimal attacks can also obey non-zero mean Gaussian distribution and degenerate to the former in some special cases. For protected systems equipped with encryption procedures, a general criterion for the selection of attacked channels is given. Finally, an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) example is provided to verify the effectiveness of the theoretical results.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9900373,IEEE Transactions on Information Forensics and Security,2022-01-01
Perceptual Enhancement for Autonomous Vehicles: Restoring Visually Degraded Images for Context Prediction via Adversarial Training,"Realizing autonomous vehicles is one of the ultimate dreams for humans. However, perceptual information collected by sensors in dynamic and complicated environments, in particular, vision information, may exhibit various types of degradation. This may lead to mispredictions of context followed by more severe consequences. Thus, it is necessary to improve degraded images before employing them for context prediction. To this end, we propose a generative adversarial network to restore images from common types of degradation. The proposed model features a novel architecture with an inverse and a reverse module to address additional attributes between image styles. With the supplementary information, the decoding for restoration can be more precise. In addition, we develop a loss function to stabilize the adversarial training with better training efficiency for the proposed model. Compared with several state-of-the-art methods, the proposed method can achieve better restoration performance with high efficiency. It is highly reliable for assisting in context prediction in autonomous vehicles.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9585517,IEEE Transactions on Intelligent Transportation Systems,2022-01-01
Resilient Cooperative Adaptive Cruise Control for Autonomous Vehicles Using Machine Learning,"Cooperative Adaptive Cruise Control (CACC) is a fundamental connected vehicle application that extends Adaptive Cruise Control by exploiting vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) communication. CACC is a crucial ingredient for numerous autonomous vehicle functionalities including platooning, distributed route management, etc. Unfortunately, malicious V2V communications can subvert CACC, leading to string instability and road accidents. In this paper, we develop a novel resiliency infrastructure, RACCON, for detecting and mitigating V2V attacks on CACC. RACCON uses machine learning to develop an on-board prediction model that captures anomalous vehicular responses and performs mitigation in real time. RACCON-enabled vehicles can exploit the high efficiency of CACC without compromising safety, even under potentially adversarial scenarios. We present extensive experimental evaluation to demonstrate the efficacy of RACCON.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9700787,IEEE Transactions on Intelligent Transportation Systems,2022-01-01
An Inverse Reinforcement Learning Approach for Customizing Automated Lane Change Systems,"Vehicle automation seeks to enhance road safety and improve the driving experience. However, a standard system does not account for variations in users and driving conditions. Customizing vehicle automation based on usersâ preferences aims to improve the user experience and adoption of the technologies. This study introduces a systematic paradigm that starts with naturalistic driving data to identify the driving behaviors and styles for a customized automated lane change system. The driving behaviors are first extracted using Multivariate Functional Principal Component Analysis (MFPCA) with minimum prior expert knowledge. The driving styles are identified by clustering the extracted driving behaviors. An Inverse Reinforcement Learning (IRL) algorithm is then used to train the automated lane change system from grouped demonstrations of the identified driving styles to capture the preferences of a group of drivers with a similar driving style. The performance of the proposed customized automated lane change system is compared to (1) a non-customized system trained on all the sample trips, (2) customized systems built on expert-coded reward functions, and (3) customized systems trained using a Generative Adversarial Imitation Learning (GAIL) algorithm. The results show that our method outperforms all the other systems with respect to the prediction accuracy of the lane change actions. Additionally, our method gains insights on the representative behaviors of different driving styles to enable customization of automated lane change systems.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9785911,IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology,2022-01-01
Cyber Attack Detection and Isolation for a Quadrotor UAV With Modified Sliding Innovation Sequences,"Common vulnerabilities in typical intelligent cyber-physical systems such as unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) can be easily exploited by cyber attackers to cause serious accidents and harm. For successful UAV operations, security against cyber attacks is imperative. In this paper, we propose a modified sliding innovation sequences (MSIS) detector, based on the extended Kalman filter optimal state estimation, for a dynamic quadrotor system to detect cyber attacks inflicted on both its actuators and sensors in real time. These cyber attacks include random attacks, false data injection (FDI) attacks and denial-of-service (DoS) attacks. The MSIS detector computes the operator norm of the normalized innovation (residual) sequence within a sliding time window and triggers the alarm if the value is above the preset threshold. For a quadrotor undergoing rapid turns in a complex trajectory, the detector observes a reduced false alarm rate as compared to other state estimation-based detectors. To address the initial estimation error problem, we implement an iteration procedure to initiate and calibrate the detector. By evaluating the sample covariance of the normalized innovation sequence, the MSIS detector has the capability to isolate cyber attacks. Finally, simulation results of a quadrotor in a periodic, complex trajectory flight are provided to verify the effectiveness of the MSIS detection and isolation method.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9764628,IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology,2022-01-01
SLAP-IoD: Secure and Lightweight Authentication Protocol Using Physical Unclonable Functions for Internet of Drones in Smart City Environments,"With the emergence of the concept of smart city and the increasing demands for a range of drones, Internet of Drones (IoD) has achieved a variety of attention by providing multiple benefits in academia and industry. IoD offers numerous services, such as traffic monitoring, environmental monitoring, and disaster management by combining infrastructure, Internet of Things (IoT), and Flying Ad-Hoc Networks (FANET) in smart city environments. However, communication among drones is vulnerable to potential security threats because the sensitive messages in various applications are exchanged via an insecure channel in IoD-based smart city environments. Since IoDs can be operated in unattended environment with minimum human interventions, smart devices (e.g., drones and sensors) deployed in IoD architectures are vulnerable to physical capture attacks. In addition, drones are resource-constrained in terms of computation and communication overheads, and it is not much viable to apply public key cryptography (PKC) that requires high computation and communication overheads. Thus, we design a secure and lightweight authentication protocol using a physical unclonable function (PUF) for IoD to guarantee reliable and useful services in smart city environments, called SLAP-IoD. We prove the security of the SLAP-IoD using informal and formal security analyses using the broadly recognized Real-Or-Random (ROR) random oracle model, and also through the formal security verification using the widely-accepted Automated Validation of Internet Security-sensitive Protocols and Applications (AVISPA) security verification. Furthermore, we compare the performance of the SLAP-IoD with related schemes. Consequently, we show that SLAP-IoD offers better security and efficiency than other related schemes and is suitable for IoD-based smart city environments.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9816023,IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology,2022-01-01
Vehicle Detection From UAV Imagery With Deep Learning: A Review,"Vehicle detection from unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) imagery is one of the most important tasks in a large number of computer vision-based applications. This crucial task needed to be done with high accuracy and speed. However, it is a very challenging task due to many characteristics related to the aerial images and the used hardware, such as different vehicle sizes, orientations, types, density, limited datasets, and inference speed. In recent years, many classical and deep-learning-based methods have been proposed in the literature to address these problems. Handed engineering- and shallow learning-based techniques suffer from poor accuracy and generalization to other complex cases. Deep-learning-based vehicle detection algorithms achieved better results due to their powerful learning ability. In this article, we provide a review on vehicle detection from UAV imagery using deep learning techniques. We start by presenting the different types of deep learning architectures, such as convolutional neural networks, recurrent neural networks, autoencoders, generative adversarial networks, and their contribution to improve the vehicle detection task. Then, we focus on investigating the different vehicle detection methods, datasets, and the encountered challenges all along with the suggested solutions. Finally, we summarize and compare the techniques used to improve vehicle detection from UAV-based images, which could be a useful aid to researchers and developers to select the most adequate method for their needs.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9439930,IEEE Transactions on Neural Networks and Learning Systems,2022-01-01
Overriding Autonomous Driving Systems Using Adaptive Adversarial Billboards,"The success of deep neural networks (DNNs) has led to its increased deployment in various real-world applications, which provides strong incentives for motivated adversaries to manipulate the results and models generated by these algorithms. We present an automated, physically-realizable, dynamic adversarial attack to compromise an end-to-end trained DNN controlled autonomous vehicle. The attack is initiated by installing a billboard displaying videos on the roadside to incoming DNN controlled vehicles so that the vehicle tracks an adversary customized trajectory. The billboard contains an integrated camera to enable estimation of the pose of the approaching vehicle. The dynamic billboard images (i.e., a video) continuously adapt to the vehicleâs relative pose with respect to the billboard while being robust to variations in lighting, view angle, and weather. The attackâs effectiveness is shown on a recently developed off-the-shelf high-fidelity simulator, CARLA, for autonomous vehicles. CARLA utilizes an end-to-end learning-based autonomous navigation system. The proposed approach is applicable to other end-to-end trained autonomous cyber-physical systems.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9514525,IEEE Transactions on Intelligent Transportation Systems,2022-01-01
How to Protect Key Drones in Unmanned Aerial Vehicle Networks? An SDN-Based Topology Deception Scheme,"Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) networks, consisting of flexible, low-cost as well as easily deployable UAVs, have attracted intensive research interest recently. Due to different roles of drones in a network, some drones can be recognized as more important than others. For example, in UAV-assisted wireless sensor networks, drones can be used as store-carry and forward nodes to collect data from sensors and aid communications among them. If UAVs that act as the bridge of a large number of sensors are attacked, the production efficiency will be seriously affected. However, existing work concerning about UAV network security seldom noticed the differences among drones, let alone implementing special measures for protecting key drones. Motivated by this, we focus on the security issue of UAV networks from the perspective of key drones' protection. We first analyze the distinctions of attack impacts when adopting different target selection strategies, revealing that key drones exist and it is significantly important to protect them. Then, a topology deception scheme based on software-defined networking is proposed, which can mitigate the attack impact by tempting attackers through our well-designed virtual topologies, leading to their misjudgments on the key drones. Extensive experimental results illustrate that our scheme can effectively deceive attackers and significantly mitigate the impact of targeted attacks.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85137607621&origin=inward,IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology,2022-01-01
Automatic Jamming Signal Classification in Cognitive UAV Radios,"The integration of Cognitive Radio (CR) with Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) is an effective step towards relieving the spectrum scarcity and empowering the UAV with a high degree of intelligence. The dynamic nature of CR and the dominant line-of-sight links of UAVs poses serious security challenges and make the CR-UAV prone to a variety of attacks as malicious jamming. Joint jammer detection and automatic jammer classification is a powerful approach against the physical layer threats by identifying multiple jammers attacking the network that realize a crucial stage towards efficient interference management. This paper proposes a novel method for joint detection and automatic classification of multiple jammers attacking with different modulation schemes. The method is based on learning a representation of the radio environment encoded in a Generalized Dynamic Bayesian Network (GDBN) whilst multiple GDBN models represent various jamming signals under different modulation schemes. The CR-UAV performs multiple predictions online in parallel and evaluates multiple abnormality measurements based on a Modified Markov Jump Particle Filter (M-MJPF) to select the best-fit model that explains the detected jammer and recognize the modulation scheme accordingly. The simulated results demonstrate that the proposed GDBN-based method outperforms Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM), Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) and Stacked Autoencoder (SAE) in terms of classification accuracy and achieves a higher degree of explainability of its own decisions by interpreting causes and effects at hierarchical levels under the Bayesian learning and reasoning processes.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85136902815&origin=inward,IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology,2022-01-01
Adversarial Swarm Defence Using Multiple Fixed-Wing Unmanned Aerial Vehicles,"This article proposes a coverage-based adversarial swarm defence algorithm. The defender swarm composed of fixed-wing unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) is assumed to have explosives onboard to intercept an adversarial swarm. The proposed approach consists of the following two steps: first, impact point optimization and, second, model predictive control (MPC)-based impact time control. The impact point optimization periodically optimizes impact points for the corresponding UAVs to maximize the coverage within the hostile swarm while minimizing the common impact time. The optimization domain is limited to a physically reachable area of UAVs with the common impact time. Besides, the MPC-based impact time controller is designed to ensure the multiple UAVs to arrive the generated time-varying impact points simultaneously. Numerical simulations are performed to prove the feasibility and efficiency of the proposed swarm defence algorithm.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9761772,IEEE Transactions on Aerospace and Electronic Systems,2022-01-01
Multitask Cooperative Formation Control of Autonomous Surface Vehicles With Interception of Moving Objects,"In this article, we present one solution to the multitask formation and moving objects interception problem of autonomous surface vehicles (ASVs) using the graph-based approach. The investigated problem includes three subtasks, i.e., to steer agents to a desired geometric pattern, to assign the ASVs for intercepting the moving attacker and forming a new formation, respectively, and to revert to original desired formation after successful interception. A switching strategy is designed to make the ASV switch between different modes. To deal with the nonlinear dynamics of ASV and improve the robustness against model uncertainties and external disturbances, the adaptive backstepping technique is incorporated. It is shown that the group of ASVs can accomplish all the tasks with different courses of attackers. The work offers a more flexible solution for the ASV group where malicious attacker exists. The effectiveness of the proposed approach is illustrated by simulations.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9628158,IEEE Journal of Oceanic Engineering,2022-01-01
Blockchain-Empowered Decentralized Horizontal Federated Learning for 5G-Enabled UAVs,"Motivated by Industry 4.0, 5G-enabled unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs; also known as drones) are widely applied in various industries. However, the open nature of 5G networks threatens the safe sharing of data. In particular, privacy leakage can lead to serious losses for users. As a new machine learning paradigm, federated learning (FL) avoids privacy leakage by allowing data models to be shared instead of raw data. Unfortunately, the traditional FL framework is strongly dependent on a centralized aggregation server, which will cause the system to crash if the server is compromised. Unauthorized participants may launch poisoning attacks, thereby reducing the usability of models. In addition, communication barriers hinder collaboration among a large number of cross-domain devices for learning. To address the abovementioned issues, a blockchain-empowered decentralized horizontal FL framework is proposed. The authentication of cross-domain UAVs is accomplished through multisignature smart contracts. Global model updates are computed by using these smart contracts instead of a centralized server. Extensive experimental results show that the proposed scheme achieves high efficiency of cross-domain authentication and good accuracy.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9551794,IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics,2022-01-01
Drone Detection Using Sparse Lidar Measurements,"Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV) have been serving people, fulfilling various roles in research, industry and military, not to exclude personal entertainment. They have also been in use more often for malicious purposes, such as annoying neighbors, disrupting air-travel, attacking people or infrastructure. Therefore, motivated particularly by malicious uses, the research community has been interested in proposing solutions for detection of UAVs. In this work, we present a ground based aerial target detection system using lidars, relying on sparse detections rather than dense point clouds, with the aim of not only detecting but also estimating their motion and active tracking.

A Shared Representation for Photorealistic Driving Simulators,"A powerful simulator highly decreases the need for real-world tests when training and evaluating autonomous vehicles. Data-driven simulators flourished with the recent advancement of conditional Generative Adversarial Networks (cGANs), providing high-fidelity images. The main challenge is synthesizing photorealistic images while following given constraints. In this work, we propose to improve the quality of generated images by rethinking the discriminator architecture. The focus is on the class of problems where images are generated given semantic inputs, such as scene segmentation maps or human body poses. We build on successful cGAN models to propose a new semantically-aware discriminator that better guides the generator. We aim to learn a shared latent representation that encodes enough information to jointly do semantic segmentation, content reconstruction, along with a coarse-to-fine grained adversarial reasoning. The achieved improvements are generic and simple enough to be applied to any architecture of conditional image synthesis. We demonstrate the strength of our method on the scene, building, and human synthesis tasks across three different datasets.

A Secure Dynamic Mix Zone Pseudonym Changing Scheme Based on Traffic Context Prediction,"Traffic context plays an important role in supporting automated driving and intelligent transportation systems. Smart vehicles explore surrounding environments by analyzing sensor data and periodically communicating with neighbors and road infrastructures. The context can be well learned in this way to support driving, but the vehicle trajectory can be also easily exposed under eavesdropping attacks. The pseudonym is proposed to hide the real identity of the vehicles. However, the effectiveness of anonymity, the safety of driving, the convenience of implementation and the utilization of resources in previous approaches have not been well-balanced. Therefore, focusing on efficiently replacing pseudonyms with the premise of ensuring driving safety, we propose a secure dynamic silent mix zone pseudonym changing scheme (TLAS) based on the real-time traffic context prediction for urban regions. It naturally takes the area in front of the red traffic light as a silent mix zone, which avoids the driving security issue caused by signal silence. Besides, the area length is dynamically configured according to the traffic context predicted in the last green light cycle, so the anonymous effect can be improved. In addition, considering the resource utilization and accuracy requirement, the adaptive prediction algorithm is applied. We conduct simulation experiments with real-world traffic history using SUMO and OMNET++, the results show that TLAS strategy can indeed achieve a better anonymous effect (reducing standardized traceability rate by 8.2%) with lower driving speed for safety concern.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9613820,IEEE Transactions on Intelligent Transportation Systems,2022-01-01
Coordinated Cognitive Risk Control for Bridging Vehicular Radar and Communication Systems,"As an essential part of the emerging Internet of Things, connected and autonomous vehicles (CAVs) have the potential to reshape future transportation systems and change the commute style in peopleâs everyday life. Among many vehicular on-board devices, radar system and vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) communication system are two important pillars for the realization of CAVs. In this paper, the concept of coordinated CRC (C-CRC) is proposed to serve as a cognitive mediator for bridging vehicular radar and communication systems. By establishing a mutual-assistance relationship, C-CRC provides a new safety mechanism that allows one system to learn from and react to the risks that the other system has encountered.

Automatic Detection and Counting System for Pavement Cracks Based on PCGAN and YOLO-MF,"The regular detection of pavement cracks is critical for life and property security. However, existing deep learning-based methods of crack detection face difficulties in terms of data acquisition and defect counting. An automatic intelligent detection and tracking system for pavement cracks is proposed. Our system is formed of a pavement crack generative adversarial network (PCGAN) and a crack detection and tracking network called YOLO-MF. First, PCGAN is used to generate realistic crack images, to address the problem of the small number of available images. Next, YOLO-MF is developed based on an improved YOLO v3 modified by an acceleration algorithm and median flow (MF) algorithm to count the number of cracks. In a counting loop, our improved YOLO v3 detects cracks and the MF algorithm tracks the cracks detected in a video. This improved algorithm achieves the best accuracy of 98.47% and F1 score of 0.958 among other algorithms, and the precision-recall curve was close to the top right. A tiny model was developed and an acceleration algorithm was applied, which improved the detection speed by factors of five and six, respectively. In on-site measurement, three cracks were detected and tracked, and the total count was correct.

A Heuristic Distributed Scheme to Detect Falsification of Mobility Patterns in Internet of Vehicles,"Autonomous vehicles in the Internet of Vehicles (IoV) have the ability to generate their mobility pattern in advance and share it with other vehicles or a central location. This information enables traffic systems to be aware of future traffic flow. However, the current classical traffic systems barely consider the spatial dependency of traffic data, and more advanced systems suffer from storage limitations. These problems will be exacerbated by the falsification of traffic data through corresponding data attacks, such as position forging attacks. This, in turn, negatively impacts the performance of traffic management systems. This article proposes a heuristic distributed scheme (HIDE) to validate the mobility pattern of vehicles by penalizing or rewarding vehicles based on the contactsâ conformation. HIDE enables every vehicle to consider the claimed mobility pattern of every neighboring vehicle that is exchanged, and assigns a penalty or reward to each received mobility pattern and share with cloudlets via roadside units (RSUs). These calculations are based on an efficient time-homogeneous semi-Markov process (THSMP) to predict the likelihood of the accuracy of mobility patterns. Cloudlets calculate a weight factor to determine if a vehicle is malicious. The validation results from THSMP reveal that a high correlation is achieved between the theoretical model and simulation. Also, the results show that the model fairly identifies the malicious vehicles and assigns a low weight of impact on them compared to normal vehicles.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9445064,IEEE Internet of Things Journal,2022-01-01
A3C-Based Intelligent Event-Triggering Control of Networked Nonlinear Unmanned Marine Vehicles Subject to Hybrid Attacks,"This paper is concerned with the intelligent event-triggering-based positioning control of networked unmanned marine vehicle (UMV) systems with hybrid attacks, where the UMV and control station is connected by a communication network and the DoS attack and Deception attack are studied. Firstly, a stochastic switched Takagi-Sugeno (T-S) fuzzy system model is proposed for the networked nonlinear UMV systems subject to aperiodic DoS attack and random Deception attack. Then, a novel asynchronous advantage actor-critic (A3C) learning-based event-triggering approach is introduced to alleviate the communication load. By using the Lyapunov stability theory and switched system analysis method, the mean-square exponential stability condition of the closed-loop system and the design method of observer-based controller are devised. Finally, an example of a networked UMV system is given to verify the effectiveness of the proposed resilient control strategy.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9582736,IEEE Transactions on Intelligent Transportation Systems,2022-01-01
A Survey of Attacks on Controller Area Networks and Corresponding Countermeasures,"The development of vehicle technologies such as connected and autonomous vehicle environments provide drivers with functions for convenience and safety that are highly capable of remote vehicle diagnosis or lane-keeping assistance. Unfortunately, despite impressive advantages for drivers, these functions also have various vulnerabilities that could lead to cyber-physical attacks on automotive Controller Area Networks (i.e., automotive CAN). To deal with these security issues, a multitude of issue-specific countermeasures have already been proposed. In this paper, we introduce existing research on automotive CAN attacks and evaluate several state-of-the-art countermeasures. Particularly, we provide a comprehensive adversary model for automotive CAN and classify existing countermeasures into four system categories: (1) preventative protection, (2) intrusion detection, (3) authentication, and (4) post-protection. From the extensive literature review, we attempt to summarize the security research regarding automotive CAN and identify open research directions for in-vehicle networks of autonomous vehicle.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9439954,IEEE Transactions on Intelligent Transportation Systems,2022-01-01
Transmissibility-Based Health Monitoring of the Future Connected Autonomous Vehicles Networks,"Transmissibility is a mathematical model that relates a subset of a systemâs outputs to another subset of outputs of the same system without knowledge of the external excitation or the dynamics of the system. This study investigates fault detection, localization, and mitigation of connected autonomous vehicles (CAV) platoons using transmissibility operators. A CAV platoon is a network of connected autonomous vehicles that communicate together to move in a specific path with the desired velocity. Failure in a physical component of a vehicle, or failure in the form of an internal delay, a cyber-attack, or a communication time-delay affects the safety and security of the CAV platoons. In this paper, we use measurements from sensors available in CAV platoons to identify transmissibility operators, which are used for health monitoring, fault localization, and fault mitigation in the platoon. We first consider the case of vehicle-to-cloud communication (V2C) to monitor the platoonâs health. Then, we assume that the platoon loses communication with the cloud, and we monitor the health of the platoon based on vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) communication. We apply the proposed technique to a model of the platoon obtained using the bond graph approach, and an experimental setup consisting of three connected autonomous robots.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9713720,IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology,2022-01-01
Analysis of ID Sequences Similarity Using DTW in Intrusion Detection for CAN Bus,"Connected vehicles have recently attracted considerable attention for revolutionizing the transportation industry. Although connectivity brings about a vast number of benefits, it can give rise to a wider attack surface as more physical access interfaces have been introduced. In particular, anomalous behaviour of the Electronic Control Units (ECUs) caused by malicious attacks can result in serious consequences and possibly lead to fatal accidents. Hence, it is important to develop methodologies that can sniff vehicular data and detect it for further attack analysis. In this article, we develop a novel similarity-based intrusion detection methodology named SIDuDTW, which identifies malicious messages inside vehicle network, e.g., Controller Area Network (CAN), by using Dynamic Time Warping (DTW) distance between CAN ID sequences. Subsequently, the theoretical analysis for the recurring sequence pattern, wave splitting strategies, similarity metric, and optimal parameters providing strong robustness against several kinds of attacks in SIDuDTW are detailed. A series of experiments demonstrate that the developed methodology can detect attacks with high accuracy. In addition, this proposed methodology significantly outperforms the intrusion detection capabilities of existing approaches in terms of basic injection, replay and suppression attacks. It is envisioned that this work will contribute to the development of safer autonomous vehicle conceptualized as a key unit within broader smart city.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9808189,IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology,2022-01-01
A Survey on Cyber-Security of Connected and Autonomous Vehicles (CAVs),"As the general development trend of the automotive industry, connected and autonomous vehicles (CAVs) can be used to increase transportation safety, promote mobility choices, reduce user costs, and create new job opportunities. However, with the increasing level of connectivity and automation, malicious users are able to easily implement different kinds of attacks, which threaten the security of CAVs. Hence, this paper provides a comprehensive survey on the cyber-security in the environment of CAVs with the aim of highlighting security problems and challenges. Firstly, based on the types of communication networks and attack objects, it classifies various cyber-security risks and vulnerabilities in the environment of CAVs into in-vehicle network attacks, vehicle to everything network attacks, and other attacks. Next, it regards cyber-risk as another type of attacks in the environment of CAVs. Then, it describes and analyzes up-to-date corresponding defense strategies for securing CAVs. In addition, it concludes several available cyber-security and safety standards of CAVs, which is helpful for the practical application of CAVs.

Adversarial Evaluation of Autonomous Vehicles in Lane-Change Scenarios,"Autonomous vehicles must be comprehensively evaluated before deployed in cities and highways. However, most existing evaluation approaches for autonomous vehicles are static and lack adaptability, so they are usually inefficient in generating challenging scenarios for tested vehicles. In this paper, we propose an adaptive evaluation framework to efficiently evaluate autonomous vehicles in adversarial environments generated by deep reinforcement learning. Considering the multimodal nature of dangerous scenarios, we use ensemble models to represent different local optimums for diversity. We then utilize a nonparametric Bayesian method to cluster the adversarial policies. The proposed method is validated in a typical lane-change scenario that involves frequent interactions between the ego vehicle and the surrounding vehicles. Results show that the adversarial scenarios generated by our method significantly degrade the performance of the tested vehicles. We also illustrate different patterns of generated adversarial environments, which can be used to infer the weaknesses of the tested vehicles.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9468363,IEEE Transactions on Intelligent Transportation Systems,2022-01-01
Security Vulnerabilities and Protection Algorithms for Backpressure-Based Traffic Signal Control at an Isolated Intersection,"There is an increasing trend in the use of wireless communication along with new traffic signal control (TSC) algorithms to leverage and accommodate connected and autonomous vehicles. However, this development has increased the potential for cyber-attacks on TSC that can undermine the benefits of these new algorithms. An advanced persistent adversary can learn the behavior of TSC algorithms and launch attacks to preferentially get green time and/or to create traffic congestion in one intersection which can spread to the entire network. In this paper, we consider backpressure-based (BP-based) TSC algorithms and compare their performance under two misinformation attacks - 1) time spoofing attack in which vehicles alter their arrival times at the intersection and 2) ghost vehicle attack in which vehicles disconnect the wireless communication and thereby hide from the TSC. We show that these misinformation can influence the signal phases determined by BP-based TSC algorithms. We consider an adversary that determines a set of arriving vehicles to be attack vehicles from many candidate sets (attack strategies) in order to maximize the number of disrupted signal phases. We show that by formulating the problem as a 0/1 Knapsack problem, the adversary can explore the space of attack strategies and determine the optimal strategy that maximally compromises the performance in terms of average delay and fairness. We propose two protection algorithms, namely, auction-based (APA) and hybrid-based (HPA) algorithms and show that they are able to mitigate the impacts of the misinformation attacks.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9356466,IEEE Transactions on Intelligent Transportation Systems,2022-01-01
Event-Triggering and Quantized Sliding Mode Control of UMV Systems Under DoS Attack,"This paper is concerned with security control of nonlinear unmanned marine vehicle (UMV) systems under a networked environment. The UMV system and land-based control station are connected by a communication network. Considering the limited communication resource in the marine environment, the dynamic event-triggering mechanisms are proposed in the sensor to controller and controller to actuator sides simultaneously. Meanwhile, the triggered output data is then quantized by a logarithmic quantizer before being sent to the remote control station. First, based on the Takagi-Sugeno (T-S) fuzzy theory, the nonlinear UMV system is molded as a T-S fuzzy model. Then a hybrid switched fuzzy system is established by taking the DoS attack and quantization effect into account. An observer-based sliding mode control (SMC) scheme is proposed to stabilize the system under DoS attack, and the observer gains and controller gains can be obtained by solving a set of matrix inequalities. Finally, a benchmark UMV system is used to show the effectiveness of control scheme.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9779098,IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology,2022-01-01
AdaptIDS: Adaptive Intrusion Detection for Mission-Critical Aerospace Vehicles,"Aerospace and defense industries are particularly vulnerable to cyber threats given their sensitive nature, significantly extending the consequences of security breaches to the national level. Aerospace vehicles are augmented by cooperative control, intelligent, connected, and autonomous systems. The risk against such systems is further amplified due to commonly relying on the MIL-STD-1553 communication bus developed with a high focus on reliability and fault tolerance, albeit with security as a second priority. MIL-STD-1553 (a.k.a., STANAG 3838 by NATO) is a standard that describes a serial data communication bus primarily used in aerospace vehicles for military and civilian applications, including avionics, aircraft, and spacecraft data handling. In the absence of core security measures such as authentication, authorization, and encryption, the bus connecting sensitive functions, including autopilot, GPS, fuel valve switches, and other avionics equipment, is easily vulnerable to a wide range of attacks. This paper proposes, AdaptIDS, a novel adaptive intrusion detection system as a security analytics framework for the MIL-STD-1553 communication bus. AdaptIDS mainly adopts data science principles and leverages advanced deep learning techniques (i.e., the stacking ensemble) to boost its generalization capabilities for detecting unseen patterns of attacks in the dynamic changing environment of aerospace vehicles. Extensive experiments are conducted using two datasets generated from an open-source simulation system, reflecting dynamic real-life scenarios. The evaluation results demonstrate that our solution outperforms existing solutions with high detection effectiveness of 0.99 F1-measure and computational time efficiency.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85141444737&origin=inward,IEEE Transactions on Intelligent Transportation Systems,2022-01-01
Event-Based Fault Detection for Unmanned Surface Vehicles Subject to Denial-of-Service Attacks,"In this work, the problem of event-based fault detection is addressed for unmanned surface vehicles (USVs) under denial-of-service (DoS) jamming attacks. A fault detection filter (FDF) is deployed to generate residual for USV systems with external disturbance and system faults. A resilient event-triggered mechanism is implemented to reduce the bandwidth occupation of communication network and energy consumption of USV system as well as mitigating the influence of DoS attacks. Based on the established framework, a switched residual system is constructed and a criterion is deduced to ensure the exponential stability and weighted  $H_{\infty }$  performance of residual system via piecewise Lyapunov functional approach. The FDF and resilient event-triggered mechanism are co-designed. Simulation results are provided to testify the efficient performance of the devised resilient event-triggered fault detection method.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9386148,"IEEE Transactions on Systems, Man, and Cybernetics: Systems",2022-01-01
Saliency Heat-Map as Visual Attention for Autonomous Driving Using Generative Adversarial Network (GAN),"The ability to sense and understanding the driving environment is a key technology for ADAS and autonomous driving. Human drivers have to pay more visual attention to important or target elements and ignore unnecessary ones present in their field of sight. A model that computes this visual attention of targets in a specific driving environment is essential and useful in supporting autonomous driving, object-specific tracking & detection, driving training, car collision warning, traffic sign detection, etc. In this paper, we propose a new framework of visual attention that can predict important objects in the driving scene using a conditional generative adversarial network. A large scale Visual Attention Driving Database (VADD) of saliency heat-maps is built from existing driving datasets using a saliency mechanism. The proposed framework model takes its strength from these saliency heat-maps as conditioning label variables. The results show that the proposed approach makes us able to predict heat-maps of most important objects in a driving environment.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9349146,IEEE Transactions on Intelligent Transportation Systems,2022-01-01
Fortified-NoC: A Robust Approach for Trojan-Resilient Network-on-Chips to Fortify Multicore-Based Consumer Electronics,"Consumer electronics hardware is designed and manufactured following a global supply chain which opens doors to their security challenges. Even with the advanced methods of formal verification and coverage analysis, there is still a chance of hiding malicious hardware/software which can degrade performance, leak data, or even stop functionalities. In this work, we present security solution of Network on Chip (NoC) based Multiprocessor System-on-Chip (MPSoC) consumer electronics (CE) systems such as set-top boxes and autonomous vehicles. Most of the existing methods targeted for such systems focus on protection in Network Interfaces (NI) and other software solutions rather than routers against Hardware Trojans (HT) which can be embedded in NoC by a rogue designer. In this work, we propose a 3-tier methodology leading to âFortified-NoCâ to secure the data and resources against different kinds of threats. A Trojan cognizant routing algorithm (TCRA) is proposed which limits the HTs to a particular router that contains them. Data shuffling with Trojan detectability is also used to mislead and identify the HTs. We validated the proposed approach using various experiments. Our proposed method is capable of mitigating the Trojan attacks such as data leakage, performance degradation, denial of service and live locking of data packets at the cost of a little latency and, some extra hardware. It is able to recover more than 80% of lost packets, improve the throughput by  $1.3\times $  against performance degrading Trojan attacks.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9619469,IEEE Transactions on Consumer Electronics,2022-01-01
Chiller Fault Diagnosis Based on VAE-Enabled Generative Adversarial Networks,"Artificial intelligence (AI)-enhanced automated fault diagnosis (AFD) has become increasingly popular for chiller fault diagnosis with promising classification performance. In practice, a sufficient number of fault samples are required by the AI methods in the training phase. However, faulty training samples are generally much more difficult to be collected than normal training samples. Data augmentation is introduced in these scenarios to enhance the training data set with synthetic data. In this study, a variational autoencoder-based conditional Wasserstein GAN with gradient penalty (CWGAN-GP-VAE) is proposed to diagnose various faults for chillers. A detailed comparative study has been conducted with real-world fault data samples to verify the effectiveness and robustness of the proposed methodology. Note to PractitionersâThis work attacks the fact that faulty training samples are usually much harder to be collected than the normal training samples in the practice of chiller automated fault diagnosis (AFD). Modern supervised learning chiller AFD relies on a sufficient number of faulty training samples to train the classifier. When the number of faulty training samples is insufficient, the conventional AFD methods fail to work. This study proposed a variational autoencoder-based conditional Wasserstein GAN with gradient penalty (CWGAN-GP-VAE) framework for generating synthetic faulty training samples to enrich the training data set for machine learning-based AFD methods. The proposed algorithm has been carefully designed, implemented, and practically proved to be more effective than the existing methods in the literature.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9264218,IEEE Transactions on Automation Science and Engineering,2022-01-01
RFAP: A Revocable Fine-Grained Access Control Mechanism for Autonomous Vehicle Platoon,"Autonomous Vehicle Platoon (AVP) is conceived as a promising solution to enhance the traffic capacity and reduce the energy consumption in the intelligent transportation system. Nevertheless, AVP without security guarantees are prone to various attacks, which probably lead to life-threatening accidents. Motivated by solving this issue, an outsourced attribute-based access control mechanism with direct revocation for AVP (RFAP) is introduced in this paper. Among them, attribute-based encryption is utilized to implement fine-grained access control during the encryption process. Furthermore, RFAP can not only realize the immediate revocation of platoon member who is about to leave the platoon without affecting others, but also achieve secure outsourced decryption with the help of edge computing units for minimizing the computational overhead of decryption on the vehicle side. Security analysis and simulation results indicate that our RFAP mechanism is practical in aspects of security and efficiency.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9523580,IEEE Transactions on Intelligent Transportation Systems,2022-01-01
PERFECT: Positional-Forgery Resistant Traffic Gap Estimation for Connected Intersection Management,"Connected and Autonomous Vehicles (CAVs) are set to be the next global revolution in transportation. One of the major challenges in a CAV environment is handling the positional-forgery of Basic Safety Messages while calculating critical traffic gaps at a Stop Sign Gap Assist controlled intersection. Traditionally, positional-forgery has been handled by isolated instances of physical layer detection and correction mechanisms, which proved unreliable during the multi-hop and majority malicious vehicle scenarios. In this work, we propose a novel framework called Positional-forgEry Resistant traFfic gap Estimation for Connected inTersection management (PERFECT) that performs optimal traffic gap estimation even during multi-hop scenarios and majority malicious positional-forgery attacks. The framework reduces traffic gap estimation error during majority malicious scenarios by over 60%, keeps the average error within 8.17%â10.62% and minimizes the maximum error across a range of malicious situations.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9773976,IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology,2022-01-01
Byzantine-Resilient Distributed Hypothesis Testing With Time-Varying Network Topology,"In this article, we study the problem of distributed hypothesis testing over a network of mobile agents with limited communication and sensing ranges to infer the true hypothesis collaboratively. In particular, we consider a scenario where there is an unknown subset of compromised agents that may deliberately share altered information to undermine the team objective. We propose two distributed algorithms where each agent maintains and updates two sets of beliefs (i.e., probability distributions over the hypotheses), namely local and actual beliefs (LB and AB, respectively, for brevity). In both algorithms, at every time step, each agent shares its AB with other agents within its communication range and makes a local observation to update its LB. Then, both algorithms can use the shared information to update ABs under certain conditions. One requires receiving a certain number of shared ABs at each time instant; the other accumulates shared ABs over time and updates after the number of shared ABs exceeds a prescribed threshold. Otherwise, both algorithms rely on the agentâs current LB and AB to update the new AB. We prove under mild assumptions that the AB for every noncompromised agent converges almost surely to the true hypothesis, without requiring connectivity in the underlying time-varying network topology. Using a simulation of a team of unmanned aerial vehicles aiming to classify adversarial agents among themselves, we illustrate and compare the proposed algorithms. Finally, we show experimentally that the second algorithm consistently outperforms the first algorithm in terms of the speed of convergence.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9508831,IEEE Transactions on Automatic Control,2022-01-01
A multiple heterogeneous UAVs reconnaissance mission planning and re-planning algorithm,"Reconnaissance mission planning of multiple unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) under an adversarial environment is a discrete combinatorial optimization problem which is proved to be a non-deterministic polynomial (NP)-complete problem. The purpose of this study is to research intelligent multi-UAVs reconnaissance mission planning and online re-planning algorithm under various constraints in mission areas. For numerous targets scattered in the wide area, a reconnaissance mission planning and re-planning system is established, which includes five modules, including intelligence analysis, sub-mission area division, mission sequence planning, path smoothing, and online re-planning. The intelligence analysis module depicts the attribute of targets and the heterogeneous characteristic of UAVs and computes the number of sub-mission areas on consideration of voyage distance constraints. In the sub-mission area division module, an improved $K$-means clustering algorithm is designed to divide the reconnaissance mission area into several sub-mission areas, and each sub-mission is detected by the UAV loaded with various detective sensors. To control reconnaissance cost, the sampling and iteration algorithms are proposed in the mission sequence planning module, which are utilized to solve the optimal or approximately optimal reconnaissance sequence. In the path smoothing module, the Dubins curve is applied to smooth the flight path, which assure the availability of the planned path. Furthermore, an online re-planning algorithm is designed for the uncertain factor that the UAV is damaged. Finally, reconnaissance planning and re-planning experiment results show that the algorithm proposed in this paper are effective and the algorithms designed for sequence planning have a great advantage in solving efficiency and optimality",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85147249768&origin=inward,Journal of Systems Engineering and Electronics,2022-01-01
Blockchain-Integrated Multiagent Deep Reinforcement Learning for Securing Cooperative Adaptive Cruise Control,"Connected and Autonomous Vehicles (CAVs) are an emerging solution to the issues of safe and sustainable transportation systems in the future. One major transport technology for CAVs is Cooperative Adaptive Cruise Control (CACC), for which unsignalized autonomous intersection crossing is a growing use case. CACC relies heavily on inter-vehicular communication and is thus vulnerable to message forgery and jamming attacks. Most solutions for CACC focus exclusively on enhancing efficiency or security but do not offer an integrated framework for achieving both on a large scale. In this paper, we propose a Blockchain-integrated Multi-Agent Deep Reinforcement Learning (Block-MADRL) architecture for enhancing the efficiency of CACC while cooperatively detecting attacks, reducing the fuel efficiency of identified attackers and securely notifying the overall network. Our approach uses multi-agent deep reinforcement learning to find fuel and throughput optimizing solutions for CACC and a cooperative verification mechanism based on Extended Isolation Forest (EIF) for attack detection. Attacker data is securely stored in a Road Side Unit (RSU) level blockchain, and we design a low-latency, high throughput consensus protocol for speedy and secure data dissemination. Simulation results indicate over 29.5% better lane throughput with our approach during acceleration forgery attack, up to 23% induced reduction in fuel efficiency of malicious vehicles, 17.6% higher blockchain throughput through our consensus protocol and over 8% improvement in attack detection rate compared to the state-of-the-art.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9765784,IEEE Transactions on Intelligent Transportation Systems,2022-01-01
Gaze Preserving CycleGANs for Eyeglass Removal and Persistent Gaze Estimation,"A driverâs gaze is critical for determining theirattention, state, situational awareness, and readiness to take over control from partially automated vehicles. Estimating the gaze direction is the most obvious way to gauge a driverâs state under ideal conditions when limited to using non-intrusive imaging sensors. Unfortunately, the vehicular environment introduces a variety of challenges that are usually unaccounted for - harsh illumination, nighttime conditions, and reflective eyeglasses. Relying on head pose alone under such conditions can prove to be unreliable and erroneous. In this study, we offer solutions to address these problems encountered in the real world. To solve issues with lighting, we demonstrate that using an infrared camera with suitable equalization and normalization suffices. To handle eyeglasses and their corresponding artifacts, we adopt image-to-image translation using generative adversarial networks to pre-process images prior to gaze estimation. Our proposed Gaze Preserving CycleGAN (GPCycleGAN) is trained to preserve the driverâs gaze while removing potential eyeglasses from face images. GPCycleGAN is based on the well-known CycleGAN approach - with the addition of a gaze classifier and a gaze consistency loss for additional supervision. Our approach exhibits improved performance, interpretability, robustness and superior qualitative results on challenging real-world datasets.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9684928,IEEE Transactions on Intelligent Vehicles,2022-01-01
Adversarial Game Against Hybrid Attacks in UAV Communications With Partial Information,"Unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) communications are vulnerable to smart attacks, where the attacker can change the attack mode (e.g., eavesdropping and jamming) via smart radio devices. To ensure secure transmissions against hybrid attacks, UAVs may transmit confidential information and misleading information alternately. In this paper, we consider a dynamic anti-hybrid attack framework with trajectory optimization, where both a UAV and an attacker attempt to find their optimal trajectories without knowing the information type and the attack mode of each other. Given the major challenge due to incomplete knowledge (i.e., each agent knows only its own information), we establish an adversarial game with partial-observation feature to formulate an optimization problem, and propose a counterfactual regret minimization learning scheme to achieve the correlated equilibrium for both the UAV and attacker. Simulation results validate the superiority of our scheme over a benchmark in UAV communication scenarios with partial information.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9640491,IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology,2022-01-01

A Novel Direct Trajectory Planning Approach Based on Generative Adversarial Networks and Rapidly-Exploring Random Tree,"Trajectory planning is essential for self-driving vehicles and has stringent requirements for accuracy and efficiency. The existing trajectory planning methods have limitations in the feasibility of planned trajectories and computational efficiency. This paper proposes a life-long learning framework to achieve effective and high-accuracy direct trajectory planning (DTP) tasks. Based on generative adversarial networks (GANs), this study develops a lightweight GDTP model to map the initial/final states and the control action sequence. Additionally, by embedding the GDTP into the rapidly-exploring random tree (RRT), a GDTP-RRT algorithm is further designed for long-distance and multi-stage planning tasks. Taking the tractor-trailer as an application case, we test the proposed method in multiple scenarios with varying characteristics. The experimental results show that the method can plan highly feasible trajectories in a short time, compared with the most applied algorithm â the cubic curve RRT* (CCRRT*). It is found that the tracking errors of our method are 29.1% and 44.1% lower than the CCRRT* in terms of position and heading angle.

A Cloud-Assisted Reliable Trust Computing Scheme for Data Collection in Internet of Things,"Large number of Internet of Things (IoT) applications with intelligent sensing devices (ISDs) are combined with cloud computing to collect and process data more efficiently. However, ISDs are vulnerable to various attacks. Compromised devices may maliciously provide unreliable data to the cloud, causing damage to IoT applications. Therefore, it is a critical issue to design an effective mechanism to ensure the security of data collection in cloud computing. In this article, a cloud-assisted reliable trust computing (CRTC) scheme is proposed to identify the trust of ISDs at low cost, providing high-quality data for IoT applications. The CRTC scheme mainly includes the following parts: First, a reliable approach of obtaining the real data of ISDs at a low cost is proposed to identify the trust of ISDs. In the proposed method, ISDs fits the forwarding packets information to form inspection information (II) with a small amount of data and then sends II to inspection nodes, effectively reducing the cost of routing II. Second, an effective method of trust computing is given to evaluate the trustworthiness of ISDs based on the data and II collected by unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV). Then, the aggregators are selected from high-trust ISDs to ensure secure data collection. Third, to obtain more reliable trust at lower cost, a trajectory optimization algorithm for UAV is proposed to collect as much II as possible and reduce the moving distance. Theoretical analysis and experimental results show that the proposed CRTC scheme is superior to previous strategies in terms of the success rate of data collection, the speed of identifying the trust of ISDs, and the UAV's trajectory distance.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9525252,IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics,2022-01-01
Secure Distributed Adaptive Platooning Control of Automated Vehicles Over Vehicular Ad-Hoc Networks Under Denial-of-Service Attacks,"This article deals with the problem of secure distributed adaptive platooning control of automated vehicles over vehicular ad-hoc networks (VANETs) in the presence of intermittent denial-of-service (DoS) attacks. The platoon, which is wirelessly connected via directed vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) communication, is composed of a group of following vehicles subject to unknown heterogeneous nonlinearities and external disturbance inputs, and a leading vehicle subject to unknown nonlinearity and external disturbance as well as an unknown control input. Under such a platoon setting, this article aims to accomplish secure distributed platoon formation tracking with the desired longitudinal spacing and the same velocities and accelerations guided by the leader regardless of the simultaneous presence of nonlinearities, uncertainties, and DoS attacks. First, a new logical data packet processor is developed on each vehicle to identify the intermittent DoS attacks via verifying the time-stamps of the received data packets. Then, a scalable distributed neural-network-based adaptive control design approach is proposed to achieve secure platooning control. It is proved that under the established design procedure, the vehicle state estimation errors and platoon tracking errors can be regulated to reside in small neighborhoods around zero. Finally, comparative simulation studies are provided to substantiate the effectiveness and merits of the proposed control design approach on maintaining the desired platooning performance and attack tolerance.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9440748,IEEE Transactions on Cybernetics,2022-01-01
Security Energy Efficiency Analysis of Analog Collaborative Beamforming With Stochastic Virtual Antenna Array of UAV Swarm,"To extend the transmission range governed by limited transmit power, collaborative beamforming (CB) can be employed with a virtual antenna array (VAA) constructed by an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) swarm. CB techniques combined with physical layer security (PLS) algorithms are known to better secure transmissions of sensitive information in the presence of eavesdropping attacks, compared to co-located antenna-based schemes. In particular, analog collaborative beamforming (ACB) with random VAA topologies, which is suitable for UAV networks due to its lower signaling/channel estimation overhead compared to the digital CB, can provide a significantly higher secrecy rate by creating noise-like signals at eavesdroppers. However, the increase in energy consumption to improve secrecy rate had been ignored in the existing ACB-based PLS schemes, which is of paramount importance considering the limited onboard energy of UAVs. Thus, motivated by such limitation, in this paper, we examine the security energy efficiency of the ACB-based PLS technique, where a group of UAVs (or VAA elements) randomly change their locations in a distributed manner to randomize the array factor of the VAA, i.e., a stochastic VAA. The proposed stochastic VAA outperforms the existing static VAA in terms of secrecy energy efficiency as verified by analytic and numerical results. Further, the impact of phase errors of the proposed scheme is also presented, which indicates the significance of the accurate phase estimation.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9765707,IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology,2022-01-01
Domain Adaptive Remaining Useful Life Prediction With Transformer,"Prognostic health management (PHM) has become a crucial part in building highly automated systems, whose primary task is to precisely predict the remaining useful life (RUL) of the system. Recently, deep models including convolutional neural network (CNN) and long short-term memory (LSTM) have been widely used to predict RUL. However, these models generally require sufficient labeled training data to guarantee fair performance, whereas a limited amount of labeled data overwhelmed by the abundance of unlabeled ones is the normality in industry, and the cost of full data annotation can be unaffordable. To attack this challenge, domain adaptation seeks to transfer the knowledge from a well-labeled source domain to another unlabeled target domain by mitigating their domain gap. In this article, we leverage domain adaptation for RUL prediction and propose a novel method by aligning distributions at both the feature level and the semantic level. The proposed method facilitates a large improvement of model performance and faster convergence. Besides, we propose to use the transformer as the backbone, which can capture long-term dependency more efficiently than the widely used recurrent neural network (RNN), and is thus critical for boosting the robustness of the model. We test our model on the commercial modular aero-propulsion system simulation (CMAPSS) dataset and its newly published variant new CMAPSS (N-CMAPSS) provided by National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA), achieving state-of-the-art results on both source-only RUL prediction and domain adaptive RUL prediction tasks.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9864208,IEEE Transactions on Instrumentation and Measurement,2022-01-01
A Sensor Fusion-Based GNSS Spoofing Attack Detection Framework for Autonomous Vehicles,"This paper presents a sensor fusion-based Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) spoofing attack detection framework for autonomous vehicles (AVs) that consists of two strategies: (i) comparison between predicted location shiftâi.e., distance traveled between two consecutive timestampsâand inertial sensor based location shift in addition to monitoring of vehicle motion statesâi.e., standstill/ in motion; and (ii) detection and classification of turns (left or right) along with detection of vehicle motion states. In the first strategy, data from low-cost in-vehicle inertial sensorsâi.e., speedometer, accelerometer, and steering angle sensorâare fused and fed to a long short-term memory (LSTM) neural network to predict the distance an AV will travel between two consecutive timestamps. The second strategy combines k-Nearest Neighbors (k-NN) and Dynamic Time Warping (DTW) algorithms to detect a turn and then classify left and right turns using steering angle sensor output. In both strategies, the GNSS-derived speed is compared with speedometer output to improve the effectiveness of the framework presented in this paper. To prove the efficacy of the sensor fusion-based attack detection framework, attack datasets are created for four unique spoofing attack scenariosâturn-by-turn, overshoot, wrong turn, and stop, using the publicly available real-world Honda Research Institute Driving Dataset (HDD). Analyses conducted in this study reveal that the sensor fusion-based detection framework successfully detects all four types of spoofing attacks within the required computational latency threshold.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85137605583&origin=inward,IEEE Transactions on Intelligent Transportation Systems,2022-01-01
Attacks on Formation Control for Multiagent Systems,"Multiagent systems (MASs) are distributed systems with two or more intelligent agents. Formation control is a significant control technique of MASs. To date, formation control on MASs is widely used in various fields, such as robots, spacecrafts, satellites, and unmanned aerial/surface/underwater vehicles. However, there is a relatively small body of literature that is concerned with security problems of formation control on MASs in past years. Our research represents the first step toward developing security attacks of formation control on MASs. Our study aims to investigate potential security problems of formation control on a multirobot system for the first time. We propose two kinds of control-level attacks and each kind of attack includes several specific attack forms. Then, we discuss specific features of formation control on a classical multirobot system and utilize theoretical analyses to illustrate how cyberattacks can influence the physical movements of robots. The experimental results of the proposed attacks show that attacks can easily interrupt formation movements of a multirobot system and several carefully designed attacks even can cause irreversible loss.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9484672,IEEE Transactions on Cybernetics,2022-01-01
Detection of False Data Injection Attack in Connected and Automated Vehicles via Cloud-Based Sandboxing,"In recent years, developments in vehicle-to-everything communication (V2X) have steadily increased in applications such as platooning and collision avoidance. V2X provides vehicles with long-range information regarding traffic congestion and routing, but also short and mid-range information allowing cooperative adaptive cruise control, automatic collision warnings, and others. Despite being potentially beneficial in several aspects, such interdependence poses a set of specific challenges from safety and reliability standpoint due to the possibility of cyber-attacks aimed at influencing the behavior of the vehicles. In this paper, a Cloud-based approach, a sandboxing framework is presented to detect the false data injection attack on connected and automated vehicles (CAVs). The sandboxing concept comes from computer security and it is adopted in a control framework as a way to isolate and evaluate the data exchanged by the CAVs affecting the vehicle control system. Numerical experiments are conducted to show the effectiveness of the approach using microscopic traffic simulation. Simulation results show that our proposed methodology is able to detect the false data injection attack existing in the V2X communication and identify the attacker in real-time less than 0.2 s.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9463871,IEEE Transactions on Intelligent Transportation Systems,2022-01-01
Certifiable Robustness to Adversarial State Uncertainty in Deep Reinforcement Learning,"Deep neural network-based systems are now state-of-the-art in many robotics tasks, but their application in safety-critical domains remains dangerous without formal guarantees on network robustness. Small perturbations to sensor inputs (from noise or adversarial examples) are often enough to change network-based decisions, which was recently shown to cause an autonomous vehicle to swerve into another lane. In light of these dangers, numerous algorithms have been developed as defensive mechanisms from these adversarial inputs, some of which provide formal robustness guarantees or certificates. This work leverages research on certified adversarial robustness to develop an online certifiably robust for deep reinforcement learning algorithms. The proposed defense computes guaranteed lower bounds on state-action values during execution to identify and choose a robust action under a worst case deviation in input space due to possible adversaries or noise. Moreover, the resulting policy comes with a certificate of solution quality, even though the true state and optimal action are unknown to the certifier due to the perturbations. The approach is demonstrated on a deep Q-network (DQN) policy and is shown to increase robustness to noise and adversaries in pedestrian collision avoidance scenarios, a classic control task, and Atari Pong. This article extends our prior work with new performance guarantees, extensions to other reinforcement learning algorithms, expanded results aggregated across more scenarios, an extension into scenarios with adversarial behavior, comparisons with a more computationally expensive method, and visualizations that provide intuition about the robustness algorithm.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9354500,IEEE Transactions on Neural Networks and Learning Systems,2022-01-01
Toward Trusted and Secure Communication Among Multiple Internal Modules in CAV,"By equipping various sensors and analyzing sensed data, vehicles can perform automatic driving; these vehicles are known as connected and autonomous vehicles (CAVs). In CAVs, tampered data will result in incorrect driving decisions. Hence, secure data transmission should be ensured to enable correct life-critical decisions. Untrusted resource-constrained modules allow attackers to obtain private data from CAVs, such as the key. Benefitting from trusted computing, the proposed scheme can verify the trusted status of internal modules and achieve secure data transmission by adopting the remote attestation and hash message authentication code. The scheme is proven to be secure in the random oracle model under the computational DiffieâHellman problem. Furthermore, we perform experiments and evaluate the performance using Intel Software Guard eXtensions, which provide part of the trusted computing function. The experimental results show that the scheme could be efficient and suitable for CAVs.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9438685,IEEE Internet of Things Journal,2021-12-15
Interdependence-Aware Game-Theoretic Framework for Secure Intelligent Transportation Systems,"The operation of future intelligent transportation systems (ITSs), communications infrastructure (CI), and power grids (PGs) will be highly interdependent. In particular, autonomous connected vehicles require CI resources to operate, and, thus, communication failures can result in nonoptimality in the ITS flow in terms of traffic jams and fuel consumption. Similarly, CI components, e.g., base stations (BSs) can be impacted by failures in the electric grid that is powering them. Thus, malicious attacks on the PG can lead to failures in both the CI and the ITSs. To this end, in this article, the security of an ITS against indirect attacks carried out through the PG is studied in an interdependent PG-CI-ITS scenario. In the considered scenario, an attacker can induce nonoptimality in the ITS or disrupt a particular set of streets by attacking the PG components while remaining stealthy from the ITS administrators. To defend against such attacks, the administrator of the interdependent critical infrastructure can allocate backup power sources (BPSs) at every BS to compensate for the power loss caused by the attacker. However, due to budget limitations, the administrator must consider the importance of each BS in light of the PG risk of failure, while allocating the BPSs. In this regard, a rigorous analytical framework is proposed to model the interdependencies between the ITS, CI, and PG. Next, a one-to-one relationship between the PG components and ITS streets is derived in order to capture the effect of the PG componentsâ failure on the optimality of the traffic flow in the streets. Moreover, the problem of BPS allocation is formulated using a Stackelberg game framework and the Stackelberg equilibrium (SE) of the game is characterized. Simulation results show that the derived SE outperforms any other BPS allocation strategy and can be scalable in linear time with respect to the size of the interdependent infrastructure.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9184000,IEEE Internet of Things Journal,2021-11-15
Leakage-Resilient Authenticated Key Exchange for Edge Artificial Intelligence,"Edge Artificial Intelligence (AI) is a timely complement of cloud-based AI. By introducing intelligence to the edge, it alleviates privacy concerns of streaming and storing data to the cloud, enables real-time operations where milliseconds matter, and brings AI services to remote areas with poor networking infrastructures. Security is a significant problem in Edge AI applications such as self-driving cars and intelligent healthcare. Since the edge devices are empowered to process data and take actions, attacking and compromising them can cause serious damage. However, the wide deployment of computationally limited devices in edge environments and the increasing happening of side-channel (or leakage) attacks pose critical challenges to security. This article thereby aims to enhance the security for Edge AI by designing and developing lightweight and leakage-resilient authenticated key exchange (LRAKE) protocols. Compared with available LRAKE protocols, the proposed protocols in this article can be effortless applied in some mainstreaming security and communication standards. Moreover, this article realizes prototypes and presents implementation details; and a use case of applying the proposed protocol in Bluetooth 5.0 is illustrated. The theoretical design and implementation details will provide a guidance of applying the LRAKE protocols in Edge AI applications.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8964439,IEEE Transactions on Dependable and Secure Computing,2021-11-01
A Provenance-Aware Distributed Trust Model for Resilient Unmanned Aerial Vehicle Networks,"An unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) network is an emerging industrial IoT network for collaborative UAV communication and management. The open architecture and dynamic topology, which provide functional benefits, unfortunately make UAVNs more vulnerable to a variety of attacks. In UAVNs, malicious nodes not only eavesdrop the communications between UAV nodes but also attempt to attack the entire network by injecting or modifying messages. This work proposes a provenance-aware distributed trust model, named UAV-pro, for UAVNs that aim to achieve accurate peer-to-peer trust assessment and maximize the delivery of correct messages received by destination nodes while minimizing the message delay and communication cost under resource-constrained network environments. Provenance refers to the history of ownership of messages transmitted on the network. The behavior of message creators and operators can be effectively evaluated based on message integrity, then generate the observational evidence. We collect the observational evidence for distributed trust evaluation, then identify malicious nodes in the network and isolate them from the network. UAVN-pro takes a data-driven approach to reduce resource consumption in the presence of selfish or malicious nodes while ensuring the safe transmission of data by digital signature technology. The experimental results show that UAVN-pro works are compatible with the existing UAV network routing protocols, and can effectively identify attacks, such as the black hole, gray hole, message modification, fake recommendation, and fake identity in UAV networks. UAVN-pro is superior to the existing security model in terms of detection rate, delivery rate, and system energy consumption in most cases.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9162060,IEEE Internet of Things Journal,2021-08-15
Malware on Internet of UAVs Detection Combining String Matching and Fourier Transformation,"Advanced persistent threat (APT), with intense penetration, long duration, and high customization, has become one of the most grievous threats to cybersecurity. Furthermore, the design and development of Internet-of-Things (IoT) devices often do not focus on security, leading APT to extend to IoT, such as the Internet of emerging unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs). Whether malware with attack payload can be successfully implanted into UAVs or not is the key to APT on the Internet of UAVs. APT malware on UAVs establishes communication with the command and control (C&C) server to achieve remote control for UAVs-aware information stealing. Existing effective methods detect malware by analyzing malicious behaviors generated during C&C communication. However, APT malware usually adopts a low-traffic attack mode, a large amount of normal traffic is mixed in each attack step, to avoid virus checking and killing. Therefore, it is difficult for traditional malware detection methods to discover APT malware on UAVs that carry weak abnormal signals. Fortunately, we found that most APT attacks use domain name system (DNS) to locate C&C server of malware for information transmission periodically. This behavior will leave some records in the network flow and DNS logs, which provides us with an opportunity to identify infected internal UAVs and external malicious domain names. This article proposes an APT malware on the Internet of UAVs detection method combining string matching and Fourier transformation based on DNS traffic, which is able to handle encrypted and obfuscated traffic due to packet payloads independence. We preprocessed the collected network traffic by converting DNS timestamps of DNS request to strings and used the trained random forest model to discover APT malware domain names based on features extracted through string-matching-based periodicity detection and Fourier transformation-based periodicity detection. The proposed method has been evaluated on the data set, including part of normal domains from the normal traffic and malicious domains marked by security experts from APT malware traffic. Experimental results have shown that our proposed detection method can achieve the accuracy of 94%, which is better than the periodicity detection algorithm alone. Moreover, the proposed method does not need to set the confidence to filter the periodicity with high confidence.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9220767,IEEE Internet of Things Journal,2021-06-15
Robust Learning-Enabled Intelligence for the Internet of Things: A Survey From the Perspectives of Noisy Data and Adversarial Examples,"The Internet of Things (IoT) has been widely adopted in a range of verticals, e.g., automation, health, energy, and manufacturing. Many of the applications in these sectors, such as self-driving cars and remote surgery, are critical and high stakes applications, calling for advanced machine learning (ML) models for data analytics. Essentially, the training and testing data that are collected by massive IoT devices may contain noise (e.g., abnormal data, incorrect labels, and incomplete information) and adversarial examples. This requires high robustness of ML models to make reliable decisions for IoT applications. The research of robust ML has received tremendous attention from both academia and industry in recent years. This article will investigate the state of the art and representative works of robust ML models that can enable high resilience and reliability of IoT intelligence. Two aspects of robustness will be focused on, i.e., when the training data of ML models contain noises and adversarial examples, which may typically happen in many real-world IoT scenarios. In addition, the reliability of both neural networks and reinforcement learning framework will be investigated. Both of these two ML paradigms have been widely used in handling data in IoT scenarios. The potential research challenges and open issues will be discussed to provide future research directions.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9174633,IEEE Internet of Things Journal,2021-06-15
Toward Achieving Fine-Grained Access Control of Data in Connected and Autonomous Vehicles,"A connected and autonomous vehicle (CAV) is often fitted with a large number of onboard sensors and applications to support autonomous driving functions. Based on the current research, little work on applications' access to in-vehicle data has been done. Furthermore, most existing autonomous driving operating systems lack authentication and encryption units. As such, applications can excessively obtain confidential information, such as vehicle location and owner preferences and even upload it to the cloud, threatening the security of the vehicle and the privacy of the owner. In this study, we propose a fine-grained access control scheme to restrict applications' access to data in CAVs (FGAC-inCAVs). First, we present a system model composed of the following elements: a trusted third party (TTP), which is a fully trusted authority; perception components like sensors, which can capture the road information (pictures, videos, etc.); and multiple applications. Then, a fast attribute-based encryption (ABE) is presented, and security analysis also shows it is secure against selective and chosen-plaintext attacks. Furthermore, we propose a key update scheme based on the Chinese remainder theorem (CRT). Finally, the theoretical analysis and simulation experiments demonstrate its feasibility and efficiency.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9277522,IEEE Internet of Things Journal,2021-05-15
Adaptive Square Attack: Fooling Autonomous Cars With Adversarial Traffic Signs,"To better understand the road condition and make correct driving decisions, traffic sign recognition becomes a crucial component commonly equipped in the vision system of modern autonomous cars. The state-of-the-art traffic sign recognition models are designed with the backbones of deep neural networks (DNNs) since DNNs are powerful to extract more effective visual features that benefit recognition performance. As the recent studies on adversarial attacks have shown that DNNs are easy to be fooled by perturbed images and lead to misclassification, in this article, we explore the vulnerability of the DNN-based traffic sign recognition model. Most existing adversarial attack methods limitedly focus on the white-box attack on the recognition models whose underlying configurations (e.g., network architectures and parameters) are accessible. Differently, we propose a novel attacking method dubbed adaptive square attack (ASA) that can accomplish the black-box attack, i.e., bypassing the access the configurations of the recognition models. Specifically, the proposed ASA method employs an efficient sampling strategy that can generate perturbations for traffic sign images with fewer query times. Extensive experiments on the benchmark data set German traffic sign recognition benchmark with large-scale traffic sign images for autonomous cars show that our proposed ASA method is advanced to perform the black-box attack with high efficiency. Although the generated adversarial traffic sign images by the proposed ASA method are visually similar to the raw images with almost imperceptible differences, they can successfully lead to the misclassification of the state-of-the-art recognition model.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9165820,IEEE Internet of Things Journal,2021-04-15
Targeted Attention Attack on Deep Learning Models in Road Sign Recognition,"Real-world traffic sign recognition is an important step toward building autonomous vehicles, most of which highly dependent on deep neural networks (DNNs). Recent studies demonstrated that DNNs are surprisingly susceptible to adversarial examples. Many attack methods have been proposed to understand and generate adversarial examples, such as gradient-based attack, score-based attack, decision-based attack, and transfer-based attacks. However, most of these algorithms are ineffective in real-world road sign attack, because 1) iteratively learning perturbations for each frame is not realistic for a fast moving car and 2) most optimization algorithms traverse all pixels equally without considering their diverse contribution. To alleviate these problems, this article proposes the targeted attention attack (TAA) method for real-world road sign attack. Specifically, we have made the following contributions: 1) we leverage the soft attention map to highlight those important pixels and skip those zero-contributed areas-this also helps to generate natural perturbations; 2) we design an efficient universal attack that optimizes a single perturbation/noise based on a set of training images under the guidance of the pretrained attention map; 3) we design a simple objective function that can be easily optimized; and 4) we evaluate the effectiveness of TAA on real-world data sets. Experimental results validate that the TAA method improves the attack successful rate (nearly 10%) and reduces the perturbation loss (about a quarter) compared with the popular RP2 method. Additionally, our TAA also provides good properties, e.g., transferability and generalization capability. We provide code and data to ensure the reproducibility: https://github.com/AdvAttack/RoadSignAttack.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9245511,IEEE Internet of Things Journal,2021-03-15
A Machine-Learning-Based Data-Centric Misbehavior Detection Model for Internet of Vehicles,"The Internet of Things (IoT) boosts road safety, efficiency, and infotainment by connecting vehicles to form the Internet of Vehicles (IoV). Specifically to safety, IoV complements autonomous cars beyond sensors' line-of-sight, facilitating vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) communications in a smart transportation environment. The correctness of data exchanged among vehicles is paramount to ensure vehicles behave as per norms. Traditional misbehavior detection methods hardly defend vehicular security effectively due to rapid dynamics and location privacy. In particular, those node-centric classifiers become ill-fit in IoV. This work proposes a data-centric misbehavior detection model based on supervised machine learning (ML). The work also integrates plausibility checks with ML techniques and instantiates the model with six algorithms to demonstrate their comparative effectiveness. In addition to misbehavior detection, the model classifies attack types to support validating countermeasures. Specifically, the work analyzes the supervised learning algorithms for detecting misbehavior in IoV, compares their performance, and identifies their limitations. VeReMi, a vehicle-to-everything (V2X) position forgery attack built-in simulated road traffic data set, is used to test the effectiveness of the proposed model. The performance metrics include precision-recall (PR) and receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves. The results demonstrate the effectiveness and significance of ML to detect misbehavior in IoV. The addition of plausibility checks improves the precision and recall by 5% and 2%, respectively.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9245568,IEEE Internet of Things Journal,2021-03-15
CuRTAIL: ChaRacterizing and Thwarting AdversarIal Deep Learning,"Recent advances in adversarial Deep Learning (DL) have opened up a new and largely unexplored surface for malicious attacks jeopardizing the integrity of autonomous DL systems. This article introduces CuRTAIL, a novel end-to-end computing framework to characterize and thwart potential adversarial attacks and significantly improve the reliability (safety) of a victim DL model. We formalize the goal of preventing adversarial attacks as an optimization problem to minimize the rarely observed regions in the latent feature space spanned by a DL network. To solve the aforementioned minimization problem, a set of complementary but disjoint modular redundancies are trained to validate the legitimacy of the input samples. The proposed countermeasure is unsupervised, meaning that no adversarial sample is leveraged to train modular redundancies. This, in turn, ensures the effectiveness of the defense in the face of generic attacks. We evaluate the robustness of our proposed methodology against the state-of-the-art adaptive attacks in a white-box setting considering that the adversary knows everything about the victim model and its defenders. Extensive evaluations for analyzing MNIST, CIFAR10, and ImageNet data corroborate the effectiveness of CuRTAIL framework against adversarial samples. The computations in each modular redundancy can be performed independently of the other redundancy modules. As such, CuRTAIL detection algorithm can be completely parallelized among multiple hardware settings to achieve maximum throughput. We further provide an open-source Application Programming Interface (API) to facilitate the adoption of the proposed framework for various applications.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9197614,IEEE Transactions on Dependable and Secure Computing,2021-03-01
Ad Hoc Vehicular Fog Enabling Cooperative Low-Latency Intrusion Detection,"Internet of Vehicles and vehicular networks have been compelling targets for malicious security attacks where several intrusion detection solutions have been proposed for protecting them. Nonetheless, their main problem lies in their heavy computation, which makes them unsuitable for next-generation artificial intelligence-powered self-driving vehicles whose computational power needs to be primarily reserved for real-time driving decisions. To address this challenge, several approaches have been lately presented to take advantage of the cloud computing for offloading intrusion detection tasks to central cloud servers, thus reducing storage and processing costs on vehicles. However, centralized cloud computing entails high latency on intrusion detection related data transmission and plays against its adoption in delay-critical intelligent applications. In this context, this article proposes a vehicular-edge computing (VEC) fog-enabled scheme allowing offloading intrusion detection tasks to federated vehicle nodes located within nearby formed ad hoc vehicular fog to be cooperatively executed with minimal latency. The problem has been formulated as a multiobjective optimization model and solved using a genetic algorithm maximizing offloading survivability in the presence of high mobility and minimizing computation execution time and energy consumption. Experiments performed on resource-constrained devices within actual ad hoc fog environment illustrate that our solution significantly reduces the execution time of the detection process while maximizing the offloading survivability under different real-life scenarios.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9138386,IEEE Internet of Things Journal,2021-01-15
On the Design of Mutual Authentication and Key Agreement Protocol in Internet of Vehicles-Enabled Intelligent Transportation System,"Internet of Vehicles (IoV), a distributed network involving connected vehicles and Vehicular Ad Hoc Networks (VANETs), allows connected vehicles to communicate with other Internet-connected entities in real time. The communications among these entities (e.g. vehicles, pedestrians, fleet management systems, and road-side infrastructure) generally take place via an open channel. In other words, such an open communication can be targeted by the adversary to eavesdrop, modify, insert fabricated (or malicious) messages, or delete any data-in-transit; thus, resulting in replay, impersonation, man-in-the-middle, privileged-insider, and other related attacks. In addition to security, anonymity and untraceability are two other important features that should be achieved in an authentication protocol. In this paper, we propose a new mutual authentication and key agreement protocol in an IoV-enabled Intelligent Transportation System (ITS). Using both formal and informal security analysis, as well as formal security verification using an automated verification tool, we show that the proposed scheme is secure against several known attacks in an IoV-enabled ITS environment. Furthermore, a detailed comparative analysis shows that the proposed scheme has low communication and computational overheads, and offers better security and functionality attributes in comparison to seven other competing schemes. We also evaluate the performance of the proposed scheme using NS2.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9319539,IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology,2021-01-01
Event-Based Resilient Formation Control of Multiagent Systems,"This paper focuses on the time-varying formation tracking issue for nonlinear multiagent systems (MASs). Based on the explicit characterizations of frequency, duration, and magnitude properties for deception attacks, a hybrid framework is proposed for time-varying formation tracking of nonlinear MASs. To realize the desired formation tracking performance under deception attacks, the distributed edge-based event-triggered communication strategies are proposed with Zeno-freeness. The designed strategies are resilient to deception attacks under some appropriate assumptions, to realize a predefined formation and simultaneously track the convex combination of leaders' states. The designed control strategies render that we do not need to detect when the deception attack happens. Furthermore, the obtained results can be deduced to deal with consensus/synchronization problems, target enclosing problems for MASs with one/multiple leaders, where the communication is attacked by malicious attackers. An example of time-varying formation tracking of unmanned aerial vehicles is provided to show the effectiveness of the obtained results.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8700273,IEEE Transactions on Cybernetics,2021-01-01
Threat Analysis for Automotive CAN Networks: A GAN Model-Based Intrusion Detection Technique,"With the rapid development of Internet of vehicles, connected vehicles, autonomous vehicles, and autonomous driving technologies, automotive Controller Area Networks (CAN) have suffered from numerous security threats. Deep learning models are the current mainstream intrusion detection techniques for threat analysis, and the state-of-the-art intrusion detection technique introduces the Generative Adversarial Networks (GAN) model to generate usable attacked samples to supplement the training samples, but it exists the limitations of rough CAN message block construction and fails to detect the data tampering threat. Based on the CAN communication matrix defined by the automotive Original Equipment Manufacturer (OEM) for a vehicle model, we propose an enhanced deep learning GAN model with elaborate CAN message blocks and the enhanced GAN discriminator. The elaborate CAN message blocks in the training samples can precisely reflect the real generated CAN message blocks in the detection phase. The GAN discriminator can detect whether each message has suffered from the data tampering threat. Experimental results illustrate that the enhanced deep learning GAN model has higher detection accuracy, recall, and F1 scores than the state-of-the-art deep learning GAN model under various attacks and threats.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9352238,IEEE Transactions on Intelligent Transportation Systems,2021-01-01
Stop-and-Go: Exploring Backdoor Attacks on Deep Reinforcement Learning-Based Traffic Congestion Control Systems,"Recent work has shown that the introduction of autonomous vehicles (AVs) in traffic could help reduce traffic jams. Deep reinforcement learning methods demonstrate good performance in complex control problems, including autonomous vehicle control, and have been used in state-of-the-art AV controllers. However, deep neural networks (DNNs) render automated driving vulnerable to machine learning-based attacks. In this work, we explore the backdooring/trojanning of DRL-based AV controllers. We develop a trigger design methodology that is based on well-established principles of traffic physics. The malicious actions include vehicle deceleration and acceleration to cause stop-and-go traffic waves to emerge (congestion attacks) or AV acceleration resulting in the AV crashing into the vehicle in front (insurance attack). We test our attack on single-lane and two-lane circuits. Our experimental results show that the backdoored model does not compromise normal operation performance, with the maximum decrease in cumulative rewards being 1%. Still, it can be maliciously activated to cause a crash or congestion when the corresponding triggers appear.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9541185,IEEE Transactions on Information Forensics and Security,2021-01-01

However, as an important part of communication security, key management for FANET currently depends heavily on the base station or infrastructures, which may easily become the attack target or increase the communication overheads of drones. Therefore, we propose a blockchain-based distributed key management scheme for heterogeneous FANET in this article, based on which drones can autonomously distribute cluster keys, update their public/private key pairs, migrate between clusters, and revoke malicious UAVs in a secure way. Security analysis and performance evaluation prove that our scheme can resist against a variety of external and internal attacks, and guarantee lightweight energy consumption for ordinary drones in the network.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9311800,IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics,2021-01-01
Novel Deep Learning-Enabled LSTM Autoencoder Architecture for Discovering Anomalous Events From Intelligent Transportation Systems,"Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS), especially Autonomous Vehicles (AVs), are vulnerable to security and safety issues that threaten the lives of the people. Unlike manual vehicles, the security of communications and computing components of AVs can be compromised using advanced hacking techniques, thus barring AVs from the effective use in our routine lives. Once manual vehicles are connected to the Internet, called the Internet of Vehicles (IoVs), it would be exploited by cyber-attacks, like denial of service, sniffing, distributed denial of service, spoofing and replay attacks. In this article, we present a deep learning-based Intrusion Detection System (IDS) for ITS, in particular, to discover suspicious network activity of In-Vehicles Networks (IVN), vehicles to vehicles (V2V) communications and vehicles to infrastructure (V2I) networks. A Deep Learning architecture-based Long-Short Term Memory (LSTM) autoencoder algorithm is designed to recognize intrusive events from the central network gateways of AVs. The proposed IDS is evaluated using two benchmark datasets, i.e., the car hacking dataset for in-vehicle communications and the UNSW-NB15 dataset for external network communications. The experimental results demonstrated that our proposed system achieved over a 99% accuracy for detecting all types of attacks on the car hacking dataset and a 98% accuracy on the UNSW-NB15 dataset, outperforming other eight intrusion detection techniques.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9198908,IEEE Transactions on Intelligent Transportation Systems,2021-01-01
Who Is in Control? Practical Physical Layer Attack and Defense for mmWave-Based Sensing in Autonomous Vehicles,"With the wide bandwidths in millimeter wave (mmWave) frequency band that results in unprecedented accuracy, mmWave sensing has become vital for many applications, especially in autonomous vehicles (AVs). In addition, mmWave sensing has superior reliability compared to other sensing counterparts such as camera and LiDAR, which is essential for safety-critical driving. Therefore, it is critical to understand the security vulnerabilities and improve the security and reliability of mmWave sensing in AVs. To this end, we perform the end-to-end security analysis of a mmWave-based sensing system in AVs, by designing and implementing practical physical layer attack and defense strategies in a state-of-the-art mmWave testbed and an AV testbed in real-world settings. Various strategies are developed to take control of the victim AV by spoofing its mmWave sensing module, including adding fake obstacles at arbitrary locations and faking the locations of existing obstacles. Five real-world attack scenarios are constructed to spoof the victim AV and force it to make dangerous driving decisions leading to a fatal crash. Field experiments are conducted to study the impact of the various attack scenarios using a Lincoln MKZ-based AV testbed, which validate that the attacker can indeed assume control of the victim AV to compromise its security and safety. To defend the attacks, we design and implement a challenge-response authentication scheme and a RF fingerprinting scheme to reliably detect aforementioned spoofing attacks.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9417240,IEEE Transactions on Information Forensics and Security,2021-01-01
Design of Anomaly Detection Functions for Controller Area Networks,"Vehicles are becoming increasingly autonomous and connected, leading to an increase in the types of security threats to vehicles. Controller Area Network (CAN) is a serial bus system that is used to connect sensors and controllers (Electronic Control Units - ECUs) within a vehicle. ECUs vary widely in processing power, storage, memory, and connectivity. There is a need for efficient security countermeasures for protecting the CAN from various attacks. In this paper, we present a novel process to efficiently design functions that can be used for anomaly detection. Our earlier work successfully demonstrated the use of Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) Networks to perform anomaly detection. This paper focuses on the efficient design and testing of functions that are attack-resistant and can be used in our anomaly detection engine. Once trained, our system is capable of efficiently detecting anomalies in real-time. We report the results of our anomaly detection function design process. We also present the results of our overall anomaly detection engine that are used as inputs to our detection engine. Our function design process and anomaly detection engine have been tested on data from real automobiles.

An Efficient and Secure Certificate-Based Access Control and Key Agreement Scheme for Flying Ad-Hoc Networks,"The evolution of Flying Ad-hoc Networks (FANETs) marks the paradigm shift from a single large drone to multiple small drones linked together in an ad-hoc fashion. To maintain the Quality of Service (QoS) in the multi-hop networking schema, FANETs utilize the available resources efficiently. However, due to open wireless boundary and high mobility of the drones, the FANETs are vulnerable to malicious nodes that can penetrate the network and, thus, pose serious security threats, particularly at the Medium Access Control (MAC) layer. Such susceptibility compromises the network security and privacy and harms the information exchange operation within the network. The attacker can either transmit a large number of reservation requests to waste the bandwidth, listen to the control messages, conduct power-efficient jamming or falsify the information to manipulate the network control. Therefore, secure access control and a key agreement mechanism are required. The mechanism must utilize the two phases, i.e., node authentication and key agreement, to counter the aforementioned attacks. Our contribution, in this paper, is a certificate-based access control and key agreement scheme, which is based on the technique of Hyperelliptic Curve Cryptography (HECC) and employs a collision-resistant one-way cryptographic hash function. In order to assess the viability and performance of the proposed scheme, we analyze it using formal security analysis techniques, such as the Real-Or-Random (ROR) model and Automated Validation of Internet Security Protocols and Applications (AVISPA) tool. The scheme is also evaluated using the informal security analysis technique, or the non-mathematical approach. The results obtained from both analyses affirm the superiority of our proposed scheme.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9345380,IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology,2021-01-01
Detecting Generalized Replay Attacks via Time-Varying Dynamic Watermarking,"Cyber-physical systems (CPS) often rely on external communication for supervisory control or sensing. Unfortunately, these communications render the system vulnerable to cyber attacks. Attacks that alter messages, such as replay attacks that record measurement signals, and then play them back to the system can cause devastating effects. Dynamic Watermarking methods, which inject a private excitation into control inputs to secure resulting measurement signals, have begun addressing the challenges of detecting these attacks, but have been restricted to linear time-invariant (LTI) systems. Though LTI models are sufficient for some applications, other CPS, such as autonomous vehicles, require more complex models. This article develops a linear time-varying (LTV) extension to previous dynamic watermarking methods by designing a matrix normalization factor to accommodate the temporal changes in the system. Implementable tests are provided with considerations for real-world systems. The proposed method is then shown to be able to detect generalized replay attacks both in theory and in simulation using an LTV vehicle model.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9187955,IEEE Transactions on Automatic Control,2021-01-01
Systematic Assessment of Cyber-Physical Security of Energy Management System for Connected and Automated Electric Vehicles,"In this article, a systematic assessment of cyber-physical security on the energy management system for connected and automated electric vehicles is proposed, which, to our knowledge, has not been attempted before. The generalized methodology of impact analysis of cyber attacks is developed, including novel evaluation metrics from the perspectives of steady state and transient performance of the energy management system and innovative index-based resilience and security criteria. Specifically, we propose a security criterion in terms of dynamic performance, comfortability, and energy, which are the most critical metrics to evaluate the performance of an electronic control unit (ECU). If an attack does not impact these metrics, it perhaps can be negligible. Based on the statistical results and the proposed evaluation metrics, the impact of cyber attacks on ECU is analyzed comprehensively. The conclusions can serve as guidelines for attack detection, diagnosis, and countermeasures.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9147009,IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics,2021-01-01
Vehicle Position Correction: A Vehicular Blockchain Networks-Based GPS Error Sharing Framework,"The positioning accuracy of the existing vehicular Global Positioning System (GPS) is far from sufficient to support autonomous driving and ITS applications. To remedy that, leading methods such as ranging and cooperation have improved the positioning accuracy to varying degrees, but they are still full of challenges in practical applications. Especially for cooperative positioning, in addition to the performance of methods, cooperators may provide false data due to attacks or selfishness, which can seriously affect the positioning accuracy. By fully exploiting the characteristics of blockchain and edge computing, this paper proposes a vehicular blockchain-based secure and efficient GPS positioning error evolution sharing framework, which improves vehicle positioning accuracy from ensuring security and credibility of cooperators and data. First, by analyzing the GPS error, a bridge can be established between the sensor-rich vehicles and the common vehicles to achieve cooperation by sharing the positioning error evolution at a specific time and location. Particularly, the positioning error evolution is obtained by a deep neural network (DNN)-based prediction algorithm running on the edge server. We further propose to use blockchain technology for storage and sharing the evolution of positioning errors, mainly to guarantee the security of cooperative vehicles and mobile edge computing nodes (MECNs). In addition, the corresponding smart contracts are designed to automate and efficiently perform storage and sharing tasks as well as solve inconsistencies in time scales. Extensive simulations based on actual data indicate the accuracy and security of our proposal in terms of positioning error correction and data sharing.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8949737,IEEE Transactions on Intelligent Transportation Systems,2021-01-01
Autonomous Control Strategy of a Swarm System Under Attack Based on Projected View and Light Transmittance,"In the study of a visual projection field with swarm movements, an autonomous control strategy is presented in this paper for a swarm system under attack. To ensure a fast swarm dynamic response and stable spatial cohesion in a complex environment, a new hybrid swarm motion model is proposed by introducing global visual projection information to a traditional local interaction mechanism. In the face of attackers, individuals move towards the largest free space according to the projected view of the environment, rather than directly in the opposite direction of the attacker. Moreover, swarm individuals can certainly regroup without dispersion after the attacker leaves. On the other hand, the light transmittance of each individual is defined based on global visual projection information to represent its spatial freedom and relative position in the swarm. Then, an autonomous control strategy with adaptive parameters is proposed according to light transmittance to guide the movement of swarm individuals. The simulation results demonstrate in detail how individuals can avoid attackers safely and reconstruct ordered states of swarm motion.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9346098,IEEE/CAA Journal of Automatica Sinica,2021-01-01
ADGAN: Protect Your Location Privacy in Camera Data of Auto-Driving Vehicles,"Computer vision and deep neural networks have been significantly promoting the development of visual perception in these years. Particularly, for autonomous vehicles, real-time image/video data is captured by onboard cameras and analyzed by computer vision techniques in many real applications. In the captured camera data, some contents can be used as auxiliary information to infer individuals' locations and trajectories, which leads to severe privacy leakage but has been rarely studied. Thus, the goal of this article is to protect individuals' location privacy by hiding side-channel information in the captured data while preserving the data utility for downstream applications. To this end, the technology of generative adversarial networks (GAN) is utilized to design two novel models, named ADGAN-I and ADGAN-II, both of which can take the original camera data as inputs and generate privacy-preserving outputs according to predefined sensitive object class. Thus, the processed camera data can defend location inference attack from adversaries in offline applications. Moreover, in ADGAN-I and ADGAN-II, the tradeoff between location privacy and data utility can be effectively balanced. Finally, the results of extensive real-data experiments validate the superiority of our proposed models over the state of the arts in utility preservation and privacy protection for autonomous vehicles' images and videos.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9234081,IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics,2021-01-01
Learning Self-Awareness for Autonomous Vehicles: Exploring Multisensory Incremental Models,"The technology for autonomous vehicles is close to replacing human drivers by artificial systems endowed with high-level decision-making capabilities. In this regard, systems must learn about the usual vehicle's behavior to predict imminent difficulties before they happen. An autonomous agent should be capable of continuously interacting with multi-modal dynamic environments while learning unseen novel concepts. Such environments are not often available to train the agent on it, so the agent should have an understanding of its own capacities and limitations. This understanding is usually called self-awareness. This paper proposes a multi-modal self-awareness modeling of signals coming from different sources. This paper shows how different machine learning techniques can be used under a generic framework to learn single modality models by using Dynamic Bayesian Networks. In the presented case, a probabilistic switching model and a bank of generative adversarial networks are employed to model a vehicle's positional and visual information respectively. Our results include experiments performed on a real vehicle, highlighting the potentiality of the proposed approach at detecting abnormalities in real scenarios.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9069298,IEEE Transactions on Intelligent Transportation Systems,2021-01-01
Multi-Source Adversarial Sample Attack on Autonomous Vehicles,"Deep learning has an impressive performance of object detection and classification for autonomous vehicles. Nevertheless, the essential vulnerability of deep learning models to adversarial samples makes the autonomous vehicles suffer severe security and safety issues. Although a number of works have been proposed to study adversarial samples, only a few of them are designated for the scenario of autonomous vehicles. Moreover, the state-of-the-art attack models only focus on a single data source without considering the correlation among multiple data sources. To fill this blank, we propose two multi-source adversarial sample attack models, including the parallel attack model and the fusion attack model to simultaneously attack the image and LiDAR perception systems in the autonomous vehicles. In the parallel attack model, adversarial samples are generated from the original image and LiDAR data separately. In the fusion attack model, the adversarial samples of image and LiDAR can be generated from a low-dimension vector at the same time by fully exploring data correlation for data fusion and adversarial sample generation. Through comprehensive real-data experiments, we validate that our proposed models are more powerful and efficient to break down the perception systems of autonomous vehicles compared with the state-of-the-art. Furthermore, we simulate possible attack scenarios in Vehicular Ad hoc Networks (VANETs) to evaluate the attack performance of our proposed methods.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9360457,IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology,2021-01-01
An Adversarial Attack Based on Incremental Learning Techniques for Unmanned in 6G Scenes,"With the development of artificial intelligence(AI), unmanned vehicles can relieve traffic jamming and decrease the risk of traffic accidents, where deep neural networks (DNNs) play an important role and have become one of the most critical technologies. Nevertheless, DNNs are still susceptible to adversarial examples. Even worse, they also show severe performance degradation when the system needs DNNs to learn new knowledge without forgetting the old one. As unmanned vehicles travel on the road, they need to frequently learn new categories and different representations. Learning all data after the new sample arrives will expend a lot of time and space. As a result, it will affect the deployment of artificial intelligence in unmanned scenes. In recent years, it has been observed that incremental learning technology can solve the above challenges. However, previously reported works mainly focused on batch learning. It is not clear how much impact the adversarial attack will have on the deep learning model when performing incremental learning tasks. This issue exposes the hidden safety risks of unmanned driving and increases discuss opportunities. Therefore, we propose an adversarial attack based on incremental learning techniques for unmanned scenes in this paper. Specifically, it can retain information previously learned by the model. At the same time, it can renew the old model to learn new model, thereby continually adding small perturbation to legitimate examples. A couple of experiments on the Pascal VOC 2012 dataset has been conducted, and the experiment results show that the adversarial attack based on incremental learning techniques has a higher attack success rate. Further, it can improve the successful attack rate by 8.43%.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9390408,IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology,2021-01-01
Adversarial Attack Against Urban Scene Segmentation for Autonomous Vehicles,"Understanding the surrounding environment is crucial for autonomous vehicles to make correct driving decisions. In particular, urban scene segmentation is a significant integral module commonly equipped in the perception system of autonomous vehicles to understand the real scene like a human. Any missegmentation of the driving scenario can potentially result in uncontrollable consequences such as serious accidents or the exception of the perception system. In this article, we investigate the vulnerability of the popular scene segmentation models designed with the backbones of deep neural networks (DNNs), which have been shown to be sensitive to adversarial attacks. Specifically, we propose an iterative projected gradient-based attack method that can effectively fool several DNN-based segmentation models with a remarkably higher attacking successful rate, and much smaller adversarial perturbations. Moreover, we also develop an adversarial training algorithm with min-max optimization style to enrich the robustness of the scene segmentation models. Extensive experiments on the Cityscape benchmark dataset consisting of large-scale urban scene images for autonomous vehicles demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed attack method, as well as the benefit of the adversarial training scheme for the scene segmentation models.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9200583,IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics,2021-01-01
Dynamic Discrete Pigeon-Inspired Optimization for Multi-UAV Cooperative Search-Attack Mission Planning,"For multiple unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) performing aerial search-attack tasks, there is a tradeoff between maximizing total benefit and minimizing consumption under the validity of constraints. This article proposes a dynamic discrete pigeon-inspired optimization algorithm to handle cooperative search-attack mission planning for UAVs, which integrates the centralized task assignment and distributed path generation aspects of the problem. Besides, a solution acceptance strategy is proposed to avoid frequent task switching. To design a reasonable objective function, the probability map is constructed and updated by Bayes formula to guide the following search motion, and a response threshold sigmoid model is adopted for target allocation during executing attack. Moreover, the flyable trajectories are generated by B-spline curves based on the simplified waypoints. Finally, numerical experiments prove that the proposed methods can provide feasible solutions for multiple UAVs considering different scenarios, such as the absence or presence of threats and insufficient resources. The results also show that the solution acceptance strategy is effective to improve performance. Moreover, the extensible mission planning system also integrates with an interactive 3D visualization simulation module, where the multi-UAV coordinated flight processes are demonstrated dynamically.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9217922,IEEE Transactions on Aerospace and Electronic Systems,2021-01-01
Fault Detection Filter and Controller Co-Design for Unmanned Surface Vehicles Under DoS Attacks,"This paper addresses the co-design problem of a fault detection filter and controller for a networked-based unmanned surface vehicle (USV) system subject to communication delays, external disturbance, faults, and aperiodic denial-of-service (DoS) jamming attacks. First, an event-triggering communication scheme is proposed to enhance the efficiency of network resource utilization while counteracting the impact of aperiodic DoS attacks on the USV control system performance. Second, an event-based switched USV control system is presented to account for the simultaneous presence of communication delays, disturbance, faults, and DoS jamming attacks. Third, by using the piecewise Lyapunov functional (PLF) approach, criteria for exponential stability analysis and co-design of a desired observer-based fault detection filter and an event-triggered controller are derived and expressed in terms of linear matrix inequalities (LMIs). Finally, the simulation results verify the effectiveness of the proposed co-design method. The results show that this method not only ensures the safe and stable operation of the USV but also reduces the amount of data transmissions.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8985406,IEEE Transactions on Intelligent Transportation Systems,2021-01-01
S-MAPS: Scalable Mutual Authentication Protocol for Dynamic UAV Swarms,"Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) domain has seen rapid developments in recent years. UAVs have been deployed for many applications and missions like data transmission, cellular service provisioning, and computational offloading tasks etc. Yet, UAV deployment is still limited, partially owing to the security challenges it poses. UAVs are particularly vulnerable to physical capture, cloning attacks, eavesdropping, and man in the middle attacks. To address some of these security problems, this paper develops an authentication protocol for use in UAV swarms. To ensure physical security and rapid authentication, the proposed protocol uses Physical Unclonable Functions (PUFs). The protocol achieves high scalability compared to the state of the art by authenticating multiple devices at once. The proposed protocol supports dynamic topologies and multi-hop communication by using spanning tree-based traversal. It is also resistant to mobility, device tampering attack, etc., and its improvements are achieved at significantly lower communication and communication cost as compared to state-of-the-art protocols.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9551779,IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology,2021-01-01
Security Enhancement for Real-Time Independent In-Vehicle CAN-FD Messages in Vehicular Networks,"The rise of autonomous driving technology and the prosperity of mobile vehicular applications have brought tremendous pressure and put forward high bandwidth and low latency requirements for vehicular networks. Controller Area Network with Flexible Data-rate (CAN-FD) is a feasible choice to meet the high bandwidth and low latency requirements of in-vehicle communication of mobile vehicles. However, CAN-FD is vulnerable to masquerade attacks because it lacks necessary security authentication mechanisms and protection measures. This study presents a security enhancement technique called forward-backward exploration for independent in-vehicle CAN-FD messages while still guaranteeing each message is real-time. In the forward-backward exploration solution, a novel dual-pointer (including the forward pointer and the backward pointer) solution is proposed; the Message Authentication Code (MAC) size of each message is then dynamically adjusted by presenting the dual-pointer movement rules until the total payload no longer increases. Experimental results with real-life CAN-FD message set provided by an automaker demonstrate the effectiveness of our solution.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9362294,IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology,2021-01-01
Self-organized search-attack mission planning for UAV swarm based on wolf pack hunting behavior,"Cooperative search-attack is an important application of unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) swarm in military field. The coupling between path planning and task allocation, the heterogeneity of UAVs, and the dynamic nature of task environment greatly increase the complexity and difficulty of the UAV swarm cooperative search-attack mission planning problem.

Efficient and Secured Swarm Pattern Multi-UAV Communication,"Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) or drone, is an evolving technology in today's market with an enormous number of applications. Mini UAVs are developed in order to compensate the performance constraints imposed by larger UAVs during emergency situations. Multiple mini autonomous UAVs require communication and coordination for ubiquitous coverage and relaying during deployment. Multi-UAV coordination or swarm optimization is required for reliable connectivity among UAVs, due to its high mobility and dynamic topology.

Anomaly Detection for Cooperative Adaptive Cruise Control in Autonomous Vehicles Using Statistical Learning and Kinematic Model,"This paper focuses on Cooperative Adaptive Cruise Control (CACC) in autonomous vehicles. In CACC, vehicles regulate their speed according to a preceding âleaderâ vehicle in the lane, forming a platoon. In a benign environment, CACC reduces fuel consumption, maximizes road capacity, and ensures traffic safety. However, CACC is vulnerable to various security threats. In this paper, we consider one of the critical threats, where the platoon leader is compromised, and forges acceleration information sent to platoon members. Such attack would lead to traffic instability and potential collisions. First, we propose information sharing in CACC model to allow vehicles and fixed infrastructure to sense and share information about platoon leaders, hence improves the reliability and supports the detection of anomalous behavior. Then, we propose a real-time anomaly detection mechanism that combines statistical learning with the physics laws of kinematics. Specifically, we propose Generalized Extreme Studentized Deviate with Sliding Chunks (GESD-SC) approach, which is applied at each vehicle in the platoon to detect anomalies in real-time based on the vehicle's own speeding decisions. Kinematic model is also utilized to detect unexpected deviations using the leader's information, communicated directly and observed by the leader's neighboring vehicle(s) and/or supporting infrastructure. Combining kinematic model with GESD-SC has shown to be effective in detecting falsification attacks in CACC. Furthermore, we analyze the time performance, and show that the proposed technique outperforms existing method in detection accuracy and processing time.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9061150,IEEE Transactions on Intelligent Transportation Systems,2021-01-01
"Morphing Attack Detection-Database, Evaluation Platform, and Benchmarking","Morphing attacks have posed a severe threat to Face Recognition System (FRS). Despite the number of advancements reported in recent works, we note serious open issues such as independent benchmarking, generalizability challenges and considerations to age, gender, ethnicity that are inadequately addressed. Morphing Attack Detection (MAD) algorithms often are prone to generalization challenges as they are database dependent. The existing databases, mostly of semi-public nature, lack in diversity in terms of ethnicity, various morphing process and post-processing pipelines. Further, they do not reflect a realistic operational scenario for Automated Border Control (ABC) and do not provide a basis to test MAD on unseen data, in order to benchmark the robustness of algorithms. In this work, we present a new sequestered dataset for facilitating the advancements of MAD where the algorithms can be tested on unseen data in an effort to better generalize. The newly constructed dataset consists of facial images from 150 subjects from various ethnicities, age-groups and both genders. In order to challenge the existing MAD algorithms, the morphed images are with careful subject pre-selection created from the contributing images, and further post-processed to remove morphing artifacts. The images are also printed and scanned to remove all digital cues and to simulate a realistic challenge for MAD algorithms. Further, we present a new online evaluation platform to test algorithms on sequestered data. With the platform we can benchmark the morph detection performance and study the generalization ability. This work also presents a detailed analysis on various subsets of sequestered data and outlines open challenges for future directions in MAD research.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9246583,IEEE Transactions on Information Forensics and Security,2021-01-01

Anomaly Monitoring Framework in Lane Detection With a Generative Adversarial Network,"The safety of an automated vehicle requires accurate information of surrounding conditions, because a false sensor output can lead to a fatal accident during driving. Thus, monitoring of abnormalities in every sensor is important for robust perception of the environment. Since it is difficult to obtain anomalous data, it is hard to develop a robust detection algorithm using only a relatively small number of anomalies. In this paper, we propose a data augmentation method for oversampling minority anomalies in lane detection. Using a generative adversarial network that makes the generator learn to estimate the distribution of anomalous data, it generates synthesized minority anomalies. The generated anomalies are used to train an anomaly detection network while minimizing latency for use in real situations. During training, the generated anomalies, with various mixed quality, are sampled differently according to their quality. This helps the detection network to be optimized with better quality data. Experimental result shows that when using the proposed anomaly detection framework for monitoring lane abnormality, it improves the performance by 12% when compared to the vanilla recurrent neural network.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9005205,IEEE Transactions on Intelligent Transportation Systems,2021-01-01
State Estimation for HALE UAVs With Deep-Learning-Aided Virtual AOA/SSA Sensors for Analytical Redundancy,"High-altitudelong-endurance (HALE) unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) are employed in a variety of fields because of their ability to fly for a long time at high altitudes, even in the stratosphere. Two paramount concerns exist: enhancing their safety during long-term flight and reducing their weight as much as possible to increase their energy efficiency based on analytical redundancy approaches. In this letter, a novel deep-learning-aided navigation filter is proposed, which consists of two parts: an end-to-end mapping-based synthetic sensor measurement model that utilizes long short-term memory (LSTM) networks to estimate the angle of attack (AOA) and sideslip angle (SSA) and an unscented Kalman filter for state estimation. Our proposed method can not only reduce the weight of HALE UAVs but also ensure their safety by means of an analytical redundancy approach.

Feasibility Study of UAV-Assisted Anti-Jamming Positioning,"As the cost and technical difficulty of jamming devices continue to decrease, jamming has become one of the major threats to positioning service. Unfortunately, most conventional wireless positioning technologies are vulnerable to jamming attacks due to inherent shortcomings like weak signal strength and unfavorable anchor geometry. Thanks to their high operational flexibility, unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) could be a promising solution to the above challenges. Therefore, in this article, we propose a UAV-assisted anti-jamming positioning system, in which multiple UAVs first utilize time-difference-of-arrival (TDoA) measurements from ground reference stations and double-response two-way ranging (DR-TWR) measurements from UAV-to-UAV links to perform self-localization as well as clock synchronization, and then act as anchor nodes to provide TDoA positioning service for ground users in the presence of jamming. To evaluate the feasibility and performance of the proposed system, we first derive the CramÃ©r-Rao lower bound (CRLB) of UAV self-localization. Then, the impacts of UAV position uncertainty and synchronization errors caused by jamming on positioning service are modeled, and the theoretical root-mean-square error (RMSE) of user position estimate is further derived. Numerical results demonstrate that the proposed system is a promising alternative to existing positioning systems when their services are disrupted by jamming. The most notable advantage of the proposed system is that it is fully compatible with existing user equipment terminals and positioning methods.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9460757,IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology,2021-01-01
Securing Mobile Multiuser Transmissions With UAVs in the Presence of Multiple Eavesdroppers,"This paper analyzes the problem of securing the transmissions of multiple mobile users against eavesdropping attacks. We propose and optimize the deployment of a single unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV), which serves as an aerial relay (AR) between the user cluster and the base station. The focus is on maximizing the secrecy energy efficiency by jointly optimizing the uplink transmission powers of the ground users and the position of the UAV. The joint optimization problem is nonconvex; therefore we split it into two subproblems and solve them using an iterative algorithm.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9511246,IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology,2021-01-01
Autonomous Vehicle: Security by Design,"Security of (semi)-autonomous vehicles is a growing concern, first, due to the increased exposure of the functionality to potential attackers; second, due to the reliance of functionalities on diverse (semi)-autonomous systems; third, due to the interaction of a single-vehicle with myriads of other smart systems in urban traffic infrastructure. Beyond these technical issues, we argue that the security-by-design principle for smart and complex autonomous systems, such as an Autonomous Vehicle (AV) is poorly understood and rarely practiced. Unlike traditional IT systems, where the risk mitigation techniques and adversarial models are well studied and developed with security design principles such as security perimeter and defense-in-depth, the lack of such a framework for connected autonomous systems is plaguing the design and implementation of a secure AV. We attempt to identify the core issues of securing an AV. This is done methodically by developing a security-by-design framework for AV from the first principles. Subsequently, the technical challenges for AV security are identified.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9130160,IEEE Transactions on Intelligent Transportation Systems,2021-01-01
Path Tracking Control of Autonomous Vehicles Subject to Deception Attacks via a Learning-Based Event-Triggered Mechanism,"This article investigates the problem of event-triggered secure path tracking control of autonomous ground vehicles (AGVs) under deception attacks. To relieve the burden of the shareable vehicle communication network and to improve the tracking performance in the presence of deception attacks, a learning-based event-triggered mechanism (ETM) is proposed. Different from existing ETMs, the triggering threshold of the proposed mechanism can be dynamically adjusted with conditions of the latest vehicle state. Each vehicle in this study is deemed as an agent, under which a novel control strategy is developed for these autonomous agents with deception attacks. With the assistance of Lyapunov stability theory, sufficient conditions are obtained to guarantee the stability and stabilization of the overall system. Finally, a simulation example is provided to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed theoretical results.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9354512,IEEE Transactions on Neural Networks and Learning Systems,2021-01-01
Using Eye Gaze to Enhance Generalization of Imitation Networks to Unseen Environments,"Vision-based autonomous driving through imitation learning mimics the behavior of human drivers by mapping driver view images to driving actions. This article shows that performance can be enhanced via the use of eye gaze. Previous research has shown that observing an expert's gaze patterns can be beneficial for novice human learners. We show here that neural networks can also benefit. We trained a conditional generative adversarial network to estimate human gaze maps accurately from driver-view images. We describe two approaches to integrating gaze information into imitation networks: eye gaze as an additional input and gaze modulated dropout. Both significantly enhance generalization to unseen environments in comparison with a baseline vanilla network without gaze, but gaze-modulated dropout performs better. We evaluated performance quantitatively on both single images and in closed-loop tests, showing that gaze modulated dropout yields the lowest prediction error, the highest success rate in overtaking cars, the longest distance between infractions, lowest epistemic uncertainty, and improved data efficiency. Using Grad-CAM, we show that gaze modulated dropout enables the network to concentrate on task-relevant areas of the image.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9104858,IEEE Transactions on Neural Networks and Learning Systems,2021-01-01
A Secure Adaptive Control for Cooperative Driving of Autonomous Connected Vehicles in the Presence of Heterogeneous Communication Delays and Cyberattacks,"The development of autonomous connected vehicles, moving as a platoon formation, is a hot topic in the intelligent transportation system (ITS) research field. It is on the road and deployment requires the design of distributed control strategies, leveraging secure vehicular ad-hoc networks (VANETs). Indeed, wireless communication networks can be affected by various security vulnerabilities and cyberattacks leading to dangerous implications for cooperative driving safety. Control design can play an important role in providing both resilience and robustness to vehicular networks. To this aim, in this article, we tackle and solve the problem of cyber-secure tracking for a platoon that moves as a cohesive formation along a single lane undergoing different kinds of cyber threats, that is, application layer and network layer attacks, as well as network induced phenomena. The proposed cooperative approach leverages an adaptive synchronization-based control algorithm that embeds a distributed mitigation mechanism of malicious information. The closed-loop stability is analytically demonstrated by using the Lyapunov-Krasovskii theory, while its effectiveness in coping with the most relevant type of cyber threats is disclosed by using PLEXE, a high fidelity simulator which provides a realistic simulation of cooperative driving systems.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8967210,IEEE Transactions on Cybernetics,2021-01-01
Anonymous Lightweight Chaotic Map-Based Authenticated Key Agreement Protocol for Industrial Internet of Things,"With an exponential increase in the popularity of Internet, the real-time data collected by various smart sensing devices can be analyzed remotely by a remote user (e.g., a manager) in the Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT). However, in the IIoT environment, the gathered real-time data is transmitted over the public channel, which raises the issues of security and privacy in this environment. Therefore, to protect illegal access by an adversary, user authentication mechanism is one of the promising security solutions in the IIoT environment. To achieve this goal, we propose a new user authenticated key agreement scheme in which only authorized users can access the services from the designated IoT sensing devices installed in the IIoT environment. In the proposed scheme, fuzzy extractor technique is used for biometric verification. Moreover, three factors, namely smart card, password and personal biometrics of a legal registered user are applied in the proposed scheme to increase the level of security in the system. The proposed scheme supports new devices addition after initial deployment of the devices, password/biometric change phase and also smart card revocation phase in case the smart card is lost or stolen by an adversary. In addition, the proposed scheme is lightweight in nature. We carry out the formal security analysis using the broadly accepted Real-Or-Random (ROR) model and also the non-mathematical (informal) security analysis on the proposed scheme. Furthermore, the formal security verification using the popularly-used AVISPA (Automated Validation of Internet Security Protocols and Applications) tool is carried out on the proposed scheme. The detailed security analysis assures that the proposed scheme can withstand several well-known attacks in the IIoT environment. A practical demonstration using the NS2 simulation study is also performed for the proposed scheme and other related existing schemes. Also, a detailed comparative study shows that the proposed scheme is efficient, and provides superior security in comparison to the other schemes.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8413130,IEEE Transactions on Dependable and Secure Computing,2020-11-01
A Secure Shuffling Mechanism for White-Box Attack-Resistant Unmanned Vehicles,"Unmanned Vehicles (UVs) have been being utilized for various applications, such as surveillance, search/rescue, and monitoring. The information they transmit is critical for decision-making. However, UVs are vulnerable to white-box attacks due to improvements in reverse engineering techniques and the openness of their software. Therefore, attackers with sufficient knowledge of a target UV can steal secret information stored in the UV by exploiting its vulnerabilities. Recently, several white-box cryptography techniques have been introduced to protect secret keys from being extracted by converting them into large look-up tables. However, none of them provide approaches to securely update the look-up tables. Thus, once a remote attacker succeeds in extracting the static look-up table from a UV, he/she can use it to decrypt past/future communications or to send false information to the control station by impersonating the UV. In this paper, we propose a look-up table shuffling mechanism that supports white-box cryptography with dynamics. The mechanism makes it hard for attackers to determine the positions of the table entries, and thus to decrypt/encrypt ciphertexts/plaintexts. To show the practicality of the block cipher with our mechanism, we implemented it on a board equipped with a GPU and show its GPU-accelerated performance.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8658144,IEEE Transactions on Mobile Computing,2020-05-01
Cyber Vulnerability Intelligence for Internet of Things Binary,"Internet of Things (IoT) integrates a variety of software (e.g., autonomous vehicles and military systems) in order to enable the advanced and intelligent services. These software increase the potential of cyber-attacks because an adversary can launch an attack using system vulnerabilities. Existing software vulnerability analysis methods used to be relying on human experts crafted features, which usually miss many vulnerabilities. It is important to develop an automatic vulnerability analysis system to improve the countermeasures. However, source code is not always available (e.g., most IoT related industry software are closed source). Therefore, vulnerability detection on binary code is a demanding task. This article addresses the automatic binary-level software vulnerability detection problem by proposing a deep learning-based approach. The proposed approach consists of two phases: binary function extraction, and model building. First, we extract binary functions from the cleaned binary instructions obtained by using IDA Pro. Then, we employ the attention mechanism on top of a bidirectional long short-term memory for building the predictive model. To show the effectiveness of the proposed approach, we have collected datasets from several different sources. We have compared our proposed approach with a series of baselines including source code-based techniques and binary code-based techniques. We have also applied the proposed approach to real-world IoT related software such as VLC media player and LibTIFF project that used on Autonomous Vehicles. Experimental results show that our proposed approach betters the baselines and is able to detect more vulnerabilities.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8892533,IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics,2020-01-01
Observer-Based Control for Cyber-Physical Systems With Periodic DoS Attacks via a Cyclic Switching Strategy,"This article studies the observer-based output feedback control problem for a class of cyber-physical systems with periodic denial-of-service (DoS) attacks, where the attacks coexist both in the measurement and control channels in the network scenario. The periodic DoS attacks are characterized by a cyclic dwell-time switching strategy, such that the resulting augmented system can be converted into a class of discrete-time cyclic dwell-time switched systems including a stable subsystem and an unstable subsystem. By means of a cyclic piecewise linear Lyapunov function approach, the exponential stability and $l_2$-gain analysis, and observer-based controller design are carried out for the augmented discrete-time cyclic switched system. Then, the desired observer and controller gains in piecewise linear form are determined simultaneously so as to ensure that the resulting closed-loop system is exponentially stable with a prescribed $\mathcal {H}_{\infty }$ performance index. Finally, a practical application of unmanned ground vehicles under periodic DoS attacks is provided to verify the effectiveness of the developed control approach.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8897656,IEEE Transactions on Automatic Control,2020-01-01
Enhancing Misbehavior Detection in 5G Vehicle-to-Vehicle Communications,"Next-generation advanced driver-assistance systems (ADAS) and cooperative adaptive cruise control (CACC) for advanced/autonomous driving are expected to increasingly use wireless connectivity such as V2V and V2I to improve the coverage, particularly in the locations where a vehicle's camera or radar is ineffective. However, using shared sensing data raises grave concerns about the truthfulness of information reported by unreliable stakeholders. For example, a transmitting vehicle may deliberately disseminate false locations to the surrounding receivers. Trusting the data, the automatic control systems in such connected receivers can be trapped to change to a wrong lane or accelerate unexpectedly, and then potentially lead to a crash. This work introduces a novel approach to support a host vehicle in verifying the motion behavior of a target vehicle and then the truthfulness of sharing data in cooperative vehicular communications. Initially, at the host vehicle, the detection system recreates the motion behavior of the target vehicle by extracting the positioning information from the V2V received messages. Furthermore, the next states of that vehicle are predicted based on the unscented Kalman filter. Unlike prior studies, the checkpoints of the predicted trajectory in the update stage are periodically corrected with a new reliable measurement source, namely 5 G V2V multi-array beamforming localization. If there is any inconsistency between the estimated position and the corresponding reported one from V2V, the target vehicle will be classified as an abnormal one. The simulation results demonstrate that our method can achieve accuracy over 0.97 in detecting abnormal reports, including those from collusion and Sybil attacks.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9007476,IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology,2020-01-01
IoT-Based Electric Vehicle State Estimation and Control Algorithms Under Cyber Attacks,"In order to provide intelligent services, the Internet-of-Things (IoT) facilitates millions of smart devices to be enabled with network connectivity to sense, collect, process, and exchange information. Based on the communication infrastructure, the IoT can allow cyber-physical devices, such as an electric vehicle, to sense, monitor, and control from the remote control center in real time. Unfortunately, the traditional communication infrastructure is vulnerable to cyber attacks, so it is a challenging task for the IoT to explore these applications. In order to overcome the problem, this article proposes an algorithm for monitoring and controlling the electric vehicle using the IoT communication network considering false data-injection attacks. First, the driverless electric vehicle with onboard vision system is represented by a state-space framework. As the electric vehicle and monitoring control center are far away, the IoT-embedded smart sensors and actuators are used to measure and control the system states. The vehicle sensing information is transmitted to the control center over an unreliable communication channel where attacks happen. Based on the mean square error principle, the optimal state estimation algorithm is derived to know and visualize the vehicle states. In order to regulate the vehicle states, the optimal control algorithm is designed based on the semidefinite programming approach. The simulation results show that the proposed algorithms are able to properly estimate and regulate the vehicle states within a short period of time.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8862884,IEEE Internet of Things Journal,2020-01-01
Path Planning Under Malicious Injections and Removals of Perceived Obstacles: A Probabilistic Programming Approach,"An autonomous mobile robot may encounter adversarial environments in which an attacker tries to influence its decisions. Through physical or software-level attacks, some of the robot's sensors might be compromised-a special concern for self-driving vehicles. Motivated by this scenario, this letter introduces and studies the problem of planning kinematically feasible (and possibly efficient) paths with bounded collision probability in adversarial settings where the obstacles perceived online by the robot display two layers of uncertainty. The first is the âusualâ Gaussian uncertainty one would obtain from a standard object tracker (e.g., an Extended Kalman Filter); the second is an additional layer of uncertainty that captures possible sensor attacks and describes the actual existence of groups of obstacles in the environment. We study the complexity of the problem and propose a general sampling-based solution framework that uses the Sequential Probability Ratio Test (SPRT) to check collision probability constraints along the computed trajectory. We also show how probabilistic programming languages (PPLs) can simplify programming common algorithms (such as RRT and Hybrid A*) for mixed uncertainty. In addition to providing an easy-to-use programming framework, our approach is shown to plan safer paths compared to a Naive Monte Carlo baseline when both approaches are allowed to use at most the same given number of samples to perform collision checks.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9184965,IEEE Robotics and Automation Letters,2020-01-01
Attack Analysis and Resilient Control Design for Discrete-Time Distributed Multi-Agent Systems,"This work analyzes the adverse effects of cyberphysical attacks on discrete-time distributed multi-agent systems, and proposes a mitigation approach for attacks on sensors and actuators. First, we show how an attack on a single node snowballs into a network-wide attack and even destabilizes the entire system. Next, to overcome the adversarial effects of attacks on sensors and actuators, a distributed adaptive attack compensator is designed by estimating the normal expected behavior of agents. The adaptive attack compensator is augmented with the controller and it is shown that the proposed controller achieves secure consensus in the presence of the attacks on sensors and actuators. No restrictive assumption on the number of agents under adversarial input is assumed. Moreover, it recovers compromised agents under actuator attacks and avoids propagation of attacks on sensors without discarding information from the compromised agents. Finally, numerical simulations validate the effectiveness of the presented theoretical contributions on a network of Sentry autonomous underwater vehicles.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8932605,IEEE Robotics and Automation Letters,2020-01-01
VeRA: A Simplified Security Risk Analysis Method for Autonomous Vehicles,"Risk analysis/assessment is an indispensable process during the design and development of Autonomous Vehicles (AVs), which is in charge of evaluating whether the risk of an attack is critical or minor. However, current risk analysis methods either are time-consuming or not suitable for Connected and Autonomous Vehicles (CAVs). In this paper, an efficient security risk analysis method, Vehicles Risk Analysis (VeRA), is proposed, fitting for evaluating the risks of attacks in the context of AV and CAVs. VeRA firstly considers the human capabilities and vehicle automation level to conduct a security risk analysis. Meanwhile, compared to the benchmark (i.e., SAE J3061), VeRA uses a simplified analysis process and fewer factors, significantly reducing the required analysis time without affecting analysis accuracy. Moreover, based on VeRA, a simple but efficient mathematical model is established to assess the risk value by considering the attack probability, severity and human control, avoiding the tedious process of looking up tables in previous methods. A case study on a general AV model shows that VeRA not only captures the critical attacks as accurate as other methods, but also analyzes the changes of human controllability with the vehicle's automation level. The performance compared to other available methods shows that VeRA can obtain the same analysis results by using around 43% less time than the benchmark.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9140383,IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology,2020-01-01
SecAuthUAV: A Novel Authentication Scheme for UAV-Ground Station and UAV-UAV Communication,"Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) are becoming very popular nowadays due to the emergence of application areas such as the Internet of Drones (IoD). They are finding wide applicability in areas ranging from package delivery systems to automated military applications. Nevertheless, communication security between a UAV and its ground station (GS) is critical for completing its task without leaking sensitive information either to the adversaries or to unauthenticated users. UAVs are especially vulnerable to physical capture and node tampering attacks. Further, since UAV devices are generally equipped with small batteries and limited memory storage, lightweight security techniques are best suited for them. Addressing these issues, a lightweight mutual authentication scheme based on Physical Unclonable Functions (PUFs) for UAV-GS authentication is presented in this paper. The UAV-GS authentication scheme is extended further to support UAV-UAV authentication. We present a formal security analysis as well as old-fashioned cryptanalysis and show that our protocol provides various security features such as mutual authentication, user anonymity, etc, and is resilient against many security attacks such as masquerade, replay, node tampering, and cloning attacks, etc. We also compare the performance of our protocol with state-of-the-art authentication protocols for UAVs, based on computation, communication, and memory storage cost.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9237145,IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology,2020-01-01
Poisoning and Evasion Attacks Against Deep Learning Algorithms in Autonomous Vehicles,"With the ongoing development and improvement of deep learning technology, autonomous vehicles (AVs) have made tremendous progress in recent years. Despite its great potential, AV supported by deep learning technology still faces numerous security threats, which prevent AV from being putting into large-scale practice. Aiming at this challenging situation, in this paper, we would like to exploit two attacks against deep learning algorithms in traffic sign recognition system by leveraging particle swarm optimization. Specifically, we first exploit the PAPSO (poisoning attack with particle swarm optimization) which focuses on the training process of the deep learning algorithms in the traffic sign recognition system, i.e., the attacker injects crafted samples into the training dataset, causing a reduction in classification accuracy of the traffic sign recognition system. Then, we also explore the EAPSO (evasion attack with particle swarm optimization) which on the other hand focuses on the interference process of the deep learning algorithms, i.e., the attacker adds some hardly perceptible perturbations to the targeted test sample, leading to a misclassification on it. Extensive experiments are conducted to shed light on the effectiveness of our attacks, and some corresponding defense strategies are also presented.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9019666,IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology,2020-01-01
Probabilistic Crowd GAN: Multimodal Pedestrian Trajectory Prediction Using a Graph Vehicle-Pedestrian Attention Network,"Understanding and predicting the intention of pedestrians is essential to enable autonomous vehicles and mobile robots to navigate crowds. This problem becomes increasingly complex when we consider the uncertainty and multimodality of pedestrian motion, as well as the implicit interactions between members of a crowd, including any response to a vehicle. Our approach, Probabilistic Crowd GAN, extends recent work in trajectory prediction, combining Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) with Mixture Density Networks (MDNs) to output probabilistic multimodal predictions, from which likely modal paths are found and used for adversarial training. We also propose the use of Graph Vehicle-Pedestrian Attention Network (GVAT), which models social interactions and allows input of a shared vehicle feature, showing that inclusion of this module leads to improved trajectory prediction both with and without the presence of a vehicle. Through evaluation on various datasets, we demonstrate improvements on the existing state of the art methods for trajectory prediction and illustrate how the true multimodal and uncertain nature of crowd interactions can be directly modelled.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9123560,IEEE Robotics and Automation Letters,2020-01-01
Multiview Scene Image Inpainting Based on Conditional Generative Adversarial Networks,"With the help of a multiview system, an unmanned vehicle system can better understand the surrounding environment and choose a more accurate and safer path to avoid obstacles. However, due to the interference of the signal or the loss of part of the signal during the acquisition, processing, compression, transmission and decompression of the video image signal, the local area of the image is abnormal, which affects the perception and decision of the system. This article addresses the problems of inaccurate restored images and noise in the restored images by proposing an image restoration method that is applied to a multicamera system. We utilize different perspective images captured by different cameras to assist and constrain the restoration of the damaged image. This method restores the image by combining sample representations and sample distribution models which respectively based on self-encoder reconstruction loss learning and generative adversarial networks. In this method, the infrastructure is a conditional generative adversarial network, the condition is the images that are from the other perspectives, and the generator is a self-encoder structure with cross-layer connection, group convolution and feature map channel exchanged. This method was carried out on a dataset recorded in Zurich using a pair of cameras mounted on a mobile platform. The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method is superior to the existing methods in terms of mean L1 Loss, mean L2 Loss and the peak signal to noise ratio (PSNR).",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8911481,IEEE Transactions on Intelligent Vehicles,2020-01-01
Real-Time Sensor Anomaly Detection and Identification in Automated Vehicles,"Connected and automated vehicles (CAVs) are expected to revolutionize the transportation industry, mainly through allowing for a real-time and seamless exchange of information between vehicles and roadside infrastructure. Although connectivity and automation are projected to bring about a vast number of benefits, they can give rise to new challenges in terms of safety, security, and privacy. To navigate roadways, CAVs need to heavily rely on their sensor readings and the information received from other vehicles and roadside units. Hence, anomalous sensor readings caused by either malicious cyber attacks or faulty vehicle sensors can result in disruptive consequences and possibly lead to fatal crashes. As a result, before the mass implementation of CAVs, it is important to develop methodologies that can detect anomalies and identify their sources seamlessly and in real time. In this paper, we develop an anomaly detection approach through combining a deep learning method, namely convolutional neural network (CNN), with a well-established anomaly detection method, and Kalman filtering with a  $\chi ^{2}$ -detector, to detect and identify anomalous behavior in CAVs. Our numerical experiments demonstrate that the developed approach can detect anomalies and identify their sources with high accuracy, sensitivity, and F1 score. In addition, this developed approach outperforms the anomaly detection and identification capabilities of both CNNs and Kalman filtering with a  $\chi ^{2}$ -detector method alone. It is envisioned that this research will contribute to the development of safer and more resilient CAV systems that implement a holistic view toward intelligent transportation system (ITS) concepts.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8684317,IEEE Transactions on Intelligent Transportation Systems,2020-01-01
Malicious User Detection for Cooperative Mobility Tracking in Autonomous Driving,"The mobility status of self and surrounding vehicles provides important information to various tasks in autonomous driving (AD) and intelligent transportation system (ITS). Accordingly, a precise, stable, and robust mobility tracking framework is essential. Compared with self-tracking that relies only on mobility observations from onboard sensors [e.g., global positioning system (GPS), inertial measurement unit (IMU), and camera], cooperative tracking markedly increases the precision and reliability of the mobility information by integrating observations from roadside units (RSUs) and nearby vehicles through vehicle-to-everything (V2X) communications in the Internet of Vehicles (IoV). Nevertheless, cooperative tracking can be quite vulnerable if there are malicious users sending bogus observations in the cooperative network. In this article, we present a malicious user detection framework, which includes two sequential detection algorithms and a secure mobility data exchange and fusion model to detect and remove bogus mobility information and integrate proposed detection algorithms with previous data fusion algorithms, which secures the cooperative mobility tracking in AD, ITS. Simulations validate the effectiveness and robustness of the proposed framework under different types of attacks.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8998259,IEEE Internet of Things Journal,2020-01-01
Anomaly Detection for Controller Area Networks Using Long Short-Term Memory,"The rapid expansion of intra-vehicle networks has increased the number of threats to such networks. Most modern vehicles implement various physical and data-link layer technologies. Vehicles are becoming increasingly autonomous and connected. Controller Area Network (CAN) is one such serial bus system that is used to connect sensors and controllers (Electronic Control Units-ECUs) within a vehicle. ECUs vary widely in processing power, storage, memory, and connectivity. Classical cryptographic approaches are resource intensive. There is a need for efficient security countermeasures for protecting the CAN from various attacks. In this article, we present a novel Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) network to detect anomalies. Once trained, our system is capable of detecting anomalies in real-time and uses minimal resources.

Behavioral Biometrics for Continuous Authentication in the Internet-of-Things Era: An Artificial Intelligence Perspective,"In the Internet-of-Things (IoT) era, user authentication is essential to ensure the security of connected devices and the customization of passive services.

Optimal Stealthy Deception Attack Against Cyber-Physical Systems,"This paper studies the problem of designing the optimal deception attack to maximize a utility function with the Kullback-Leibler divergence adopted as a detection constraint. The utility function reflects the goal of pulling the state away from the origin, increasing the cost of the controller and decreasing the cost of the attacker. To analyze the stealthiness of the attack, the attack signal is decomposed into two parts, one of which is strict stealthy. The necessary and sufficient condition is derived for the case that the strict stealthy attack cannot lead to an unbounded benefit. In this case, the linear transformation of the optimal attack is proved to be a Gaussian distribution. With the mean value and covariance of the Gaussian distribution as variables, the original problem is transformed into a new problem which may not be convex. A suboptimal attack policy is provided and the upper bound for the loss of benefit when using the suboptimal attack is also given. A numerical example of unmanned ground vehicle is illustrated to verify the effectiveness of the proposed attack policy.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8709954,IEEE Transactions on Cybernetics,2020-01-01
Resilient Output Containment of Heterogeneous Cooperative and Adversarial Multigroup Systems,"This note introduces a new concept of cooperative and adversarial multigroup system, which consists of cooperative leaders and followers, as well as adversaries. For example, cooperation of multiple military vehicles operate in complex dynamic networked environments with unknown enemies and hidden malicious attackers. The lack of global situational awareness in distributed settings makes autonomous vehicles prone to cyberattacks and infiltration. Each agent is unaware of the motives of its neighbors and may receive information/data from both the teammates and the adversaries. Secure and resilient control protocols are essential for the networked multigroup systems to prevent the adversaries' attacks from propagating across the network, which may influence the system performance and even overall stability. To counter sensor faults and attacks from the adversaries, a distributed resilient control architecture is proposed, which guarantees uniform ultimate boundedness of the closed-loop dynamical system. Numerical simulations illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed results.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8869852,IEEE Transactions on Automatic Control,2020-01-01
Detection Performance to Spatially Random UAV Using the Ground Vehicle,"It is very challenging to detect an unmanned-aerial-vehicle (UAV) when it is applied to launch an attack by the enemy's country, due to its feature of mobility and flexibility. Against this background, in this paper, from wireless communication point of view, we study the detection probability of home country's ground vehicle (GV) to enemy's ground-station (GS)-to-UAV transmission system. We assume that the location of the GV is randomly distributed inside the space confined by the largest detection distance. Moreover, we assume the enemy's UAV is randomly distributed in the coverage space of the GS-to-UAV (G2A) transmission link but also keep the security distance from the GS. To this end, we first characterize the statistical features of the signal-to-noise-ratio (SNR) over the G2V and G2A links. Then, we define detection outage probability (DOP) and average detection capacity (ADC), and show their approximations. Finally, Monte-Carlo simulations are conducted to verify the correctness of our proposed analytical models.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9293404,IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology,2020-01-01
On the Design of Conditional Privacy Preserving Batch Verification-Based Authentication Scheme for Internet of Vehicles Deployment,"In the Internet of Vehicles (IoV), secure information sharing among vehicles is crucial in order to upgrade driving safety as well as to strengthen vehicular services. However, public communication among vehicles leads to various potential attacks, such as replay, man-in-the-middle, impersonation, unlinkability and traceability attacks. To address this issue, we design a new conditional privacy preserving batch verification-based authentication mechanism in the IoV environment using Elliptic Curve Cryptography (ECC) technique, where a vehicle can authenticate its neighbor vehicle and also a Road-Side Unit (RSU) can authenticate its nearby vehicles in a batch. The proposed scheme is shown to be highly secure against a passive/active adversary through various security analysis, such as random oracle based formal security, formal security verification via automated simulation tool, and also informal security analysis. An exhaustive comparative analysis reveals that the proposed scheme offers better security and functionality attributes, and comparable storage, communication and computation overheads when these are compared with the relevant schemes.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9042206,IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology,2020-01-01
A2G2V: Automatic Attack Graph Generation and Visualization and Its Applications to Computer and SCADA Networks,"Securing cyber-physical systems (CPS) and Internet of Things (IoT) systems requires the identification of how interdependence among existing atomic vulnerabilities may be exploited by an adversary to stitch together an attack that can compromise the system. Therefore, accurate attack graphs play a significant role in systems security. A manual construction of the attack graphs is tedious and error-prone, this paper proposes a model-checking-based automated attack graph generator and visualizer (A2G2V). The proposed A2G2V algorithm uses existing model-checking tools, an architecture description tool, and our own code to generate an attack graph that enumerates the set of all possible sequences in which atomic-level vulnerabilities can be exploited to compromise system security. The architecture description tool captures a formal representation of the networked system, its atomic vulnerabilities, their pre-and post-conditions, and security property of interest. A model-checker is employed to automatically identify an attack sequence in the form of a counterexample. Our own code integrated with the model-checker parses the counterexamples, encodes those for specification relaxation, and iterates until all attack sequences are revealed. Finally, a visualization tool has also been incorporated with A2G2V to generate a graphical representation of the generated attack graph. The results are illustrated through application to computer as well as control (SCADA) networks.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8720257,"IEEE Transactions on Systems, Man, and Cybernetics: Systems",2020-01-01
CANeleon: Protecting CAN Bus With Frame ID Chameleon,"The Controller Area Network (CAN) has been widely used in the automotive and industrial automation for over two decades. However, due to the lack of security mechanisms, CAN is vulnerable to attacks. In this paper, we propose a novel protection scheme called CANeleon. It can defend CAN against a smart attacker who might inject malicious frames with legitimate frame IDs, which cannot be mitigated by existing countermeasures. Inspired by the idea of moving target defense technologies, CANeleon equips each legitimate CAN node with the ability to shift the spoofed frame ID. In this way, the IDs of malicious frames are exposed and can be further filtered by legitimate nodes. Moreover, CANeleon neither inserts new information to the frame, nor requires any modification to the CAN protocol, so it is in compliance with the existing standards. CANeleon is a decentralized mechanism guaranteeing that the protection could be done simultaneously without additional communication. Experiments on a CAN bus prototype and a real self-driving vehicle prove the effectiveness of CANeleon.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9079183,IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology,2020-01-01
DiversityGAN: Diversity-Aware Vehicle Motion Prediction via Latent Semantic Sampling,"Vehicle trajectory prediction is crucial for autonomous driving and advanced driver assistant systems. While existing approaches may sample from a predicted distribution of vehicle trajectories, they lack the ability to explore it â a key ability for evaluating safety from a planning and verification perspective. In this work, we devise a novel approach for generating realistic and diverse vehicle trajectories. We first extend the generative adversarial network (GAN) framework with a low-dimensional approximate semantic space, and shape that space to capture semantics such as merging and turning. We then sample from this space in a way that mimics the predicted distribution, but allows us to control coverage of semantically distinct outcomes. We validate our approach on a publicly available dataset and show results that achieve state-of-the-art prediction performance, while providing improved coverage of the space of predicted trajectory semantics.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9127831,IEEE Robotics and Automation Letters,2020-01-01
Unified Biometric Privacy Preserving Three-Factor Authentication and Key Agreement for Cloud-Assisted Autonomous Vehicles,"Autonomous vehicles (AVs) are increasingly common, although there remain a number of limitations that need to be addressed in order for their deployment to be more widespread. For example, to mitigate the failure of self-driving functions in AVs, introducing the remote control capability (which allows a human driver to operate the vehicle remotely in certain circumferences) is one of several countermeasures proposed. However, the remote control capability breaks the isolation of onboard driving systems and can be potentially exploited by malicious actors to take over control of the AVs; thus, risking the safety of the passengers and pedestrians (e.g., AVs are remotely taken over by terrorist groups to carry out coordinated attacks in places of mass gatherings). Therefore, security is a key, mandatory feature in the design of AVs. In this paper, we propose a cloud-centric three-factor authentication and key agreement protocol (CT-AKA) integrating passwords, biometrics and smart cards to ensure secure access to both cloud and AVs. Three typical biometric encryption approaches, including fuzzy vault, fuzzy commitment, and fuzzy extractor, are unified to achieve three-factor authentication without leaking the biometric privacy of users. Moreover, two session keys are negotiated in our protocol, namely: one between the user and AV to support secure remote control of the AV, and the other is negotiated between the mobile device and the cloud to introduce resilience to the compromise of ephemeral security parameters to ensure cloud data access security with a high security guarantee. Finally, we formally verify the security properties and evaluate the efficiency of CT-AKA, whose findings demonstrate that the protocol achieves high security strength with reasonable computation and communication costs.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8979385,IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology,2020-01-01
Impacts of Constrained Sensing and Communication Based Attacks on Vehicular Platoons,"Vehicular platooning promises to bring a faster, safer, and more efficient transportation. Automated platooned vehicles will rely on information obtained from inter-vehicle communication channels and on-board sensors to make driving decisions and achieve platooning. However, such reliance creates an opportunity for safety violating attacks intended to disrupt the platoon formation and cause accidents. In this work, we investigate more realistic attacks mounted against the communication and sensing functionalities of platooned vehicles. More specifically, we are interested in approximating the set of final unsafe states, that can be reached by mounting realistically constrained attacks capable of introducing delay and injecting false-data against the aforementioned functionalities. For that purpose, we will use reachability analysis which enables us to realize whether it is possible to drive the platoon from initial to final states given performance and physical bounds. Our results suggest that these two types of attack are able to steer the platoon towards dangerous states and generate impacts on passengers' safety by causing crashes at high speeds.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9037093,IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology,2020-01-01
Deep reinforcement learning and its application in autonomous fitting optimization for attack areas of UCAVs,"The ever-changing battlefield environment requires the use of robust and adaptive technologies integrated into a reliable platform. Unmanned combat aerial vehicles (UCAVs) aim to integrate such advanced technologies while increasing the tactical capabilities of combat aircraft. As a research object, common UCAV uses the neural network fitting strategy to obtain values of attack areas. However, this simple strategy cannot cope with complex environmental changes and autonomously optimize decision-making problems. To solve the problem, this paper proposes a new deep deterministic policy gradient (DDPG) strategy based on deep reinforcement learning for the attack area fitting of UCAVs in the future battlefield. Simulation results show that the autonomy and environmental adaptability of UCAVs in the future battlefield will be improved based on the new DDPG algorithm and the training process converges quickly. We can obtain the optimal values of attack areas in real time during the whole flight with the well-trained deep network.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9180140,Journal of Systems Engineering and Electronics,2020-01-01

Adversarial Examples: Opportunities and Challenges,"Deep neural networks (DNNs) have shown huge superiority over humans in image recognition, speech processing, autonomous vehicles, and medical diagnosis. However, recent studies indicate that DNNs are vulnerable to adversarial examples (AEs), which are designed by attackers to fool deep learning models. Different from real examples, AEs can mislead the model to predict incorrect outputs while hardly be distinguished by human eyes, therefore threaten security-critical deep-learning applications. In recent years, the generation and defense of AEs have become a research hotspot in the field of artificial intelligence (AI) security. This article reviews the latest research progress of AEs. First, we introduce the concept, cause, characteristics, and evaluation metrics of AEs, then give a survey on the state-of-the-art AE generation methods with the discussion of advantages and disadvantages. After that, we review the existing defenses and discuss their limitations. Finally, future research opportunities and challenges on AEs are prospected.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8842604,IEEE Transactions on Neural Networks and Learning Systems,2020-01-01
The Safety Potential of Lane Keeping Assistance and Possible Actions to Improve the Potential,"Before widespread automated driving, driver assistance systems become more common and can deliver safety benefits. This study focuses on current and future lane keeping assistance (LKA) systems and their potential safety effects by analysing real-world crash data and LKA's possibilities to prevent fatal passenger car crashes. The analysed data includes in-depth analysis of 364 fatal head-on and single-vehicle crashes in Finland. According to statistical analysis, 27% of these crashes could potentially have been prevented had currently available LKA been deployed. In this study, many issues are examined related to the lane markings' visibility, infrastructure, weather, and driver-related risks, which rationalise the results, compliment previous research, and highlight possibilities to increase the safety potential of LKA. Related to the lane markings' visibility, safety potential could be improved by allocating more resources to road maintenance and to snow clearance. Advanced LKA enabling exploiting digital lane markings could hypothetically almost double the safety potential as weather conditions or the visibility of lane markings would not restrict LKA's operation. While the driver is still in charge of driving tasks, driver-related risks are difficult to manage and the crashes caused intendedly or due to driver's attack of illness are not preventable by current LKA systems.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9084279,IEEE Transactions on Intelligent Vehicles,2020-01-01
Android HIV: A Study of Repackaging Malware for Evading Machine-Learning Detection,"Machine learning-based solutions have been successfully employed for the automatic detection of malware on Android. However, machine learning models lack robustness to adversarial examples, which are crafted by adding carefully chosen perturbations to the normal inputs. So far, the adversarial examples can only deceive detectors that rely on syntactic features (e.g., requested permissions, API calls, etc.), and the perturbations can only be implemented by simply modifying applicationâs manifest. While recent Android malware detectors rely more on semantic features from Dalvik bytecode rather than manifest, existing attacking/defending methods are no longer effective. In this paper, we introduce a new attacking method that generates adversarial examples of Android malware and evades being detected by the current models. To this end, we propose a method of applying optimal perturbations onto Android APK that can successfully deceive the machine learning detectors. We develop an automated tool to generate the adversarial examples without human intervention. In contrast to existing works, the adversarial examples crafted by our method can also deceive recent machine learning-based detectors that rely on semantic features such as control-flow-graph. The perturbations can also be implemented directly onto APKâs Dalvik bytecode rather than Android manifest to evade from recent detectors. We demonstrate our attack on two state-of-the-art Android malware detection schemes, MaMaDroid and Drebin. Our results show that the malware detection rates decreased from 96% to 0% in MaMaDroid, and from 97% to 0% in Drebin, with just a small number of codes to be inserted into the APK.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8782574,IEEE Transactions on Information Forensics and Security,2020-01-01
Learning-Based Real-Time Process-Aware Anomaly Monitoring for Assured Autonomy,"Various learning-based approaches have been proposed recently for robot control in complex unknown environments. However, ensuring safety in these systems is essential. Learning-based approaches are usually black-box systems which are difficult to interpret/verify. We propose a real-time continuous safety checking system which monitors the validity of the mapping from the sensor input to the actuator command (i.e., controller-focused anomaly detection) and from the actuator command to the sensor input (i.e., system-focused anomaly detection). Our controller-focused anomaly monitor is an image conditioned energy based generative adversarial network in which the discriminator acts as an energy function attributing low energies to proper actuator commands and high energy to anomalous actuator commands. Our system-focused anomaly monitor is based on an action condition video prediction framework, which finds the action conditioned future frame most similar to the actual future frame and compares it with the true action to detect anomaly. We experimentally demonstrate the effectiveness of our framework for an autonomous navigation system in indoor (on datasets from our ground vehicle) and outdoor environments (on Udacity dataset). Furthermore, we show through experimental evaluations that our proposed framework is resilient to various data corruptions common in a vision based system.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9099389,IEEE Transactions on Intelligent Vehicles,2020-01-01
Drones in Distress: A Game-Theoretic Countermeasure for Protecting UAVs Against GPS Spoofing,"One prominent security threat that targets unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) is the capture via global positioning system (GPS) spoofing in which an attacker manipulates a UAV's GPS signals in order to capture it. Given the anticipated widespread deployment of UAVs for various purposes, it is imperative to develop new security solutions against such attacks. In this article, a mathematical framework is introduced for analyzing and mitigating the effects of GPS spoofing attacks on UAVs. In particular, system dynamics are used to model the optimal routes that the UAVs will adopt to reach their destinations. The GPS spoofer's effect on each UAV's route is also captured by the model. To this end, the spoofer's optimal imposed locations on the UAVs, are analytically derived; allowing the UAVs to predict their traveling routes under attack. Then, a countermeasure mechanism is developed to mitigate the effect of the GPS spoofing attack. The countermeasure is built on the premise of cooperative localization, in which a UAV can determine its location using nearby UAVs instead of the possibly compromised GPS locations. To better utilize the proposed defense mechanism, a dynamic Stackelberg game is formulated to model the interactions between a GPS spoofer and a drone operator. In particular, the drone operator acts as the leader that determines its optimal strategy in light of the spoofer's expected response strategy. The equilibrium strategies of the game are then analytically characterized and studied through a novel proposed algorithm. The simulation results show that, when combined with the Stackelberg strategies, the proposed defense mechanism will outperform baseline strategy selection techniques in terms of reducing the possibility of UAV capture.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8946587,IEEE Internet of Things Journal,2020-01-01
A Machine Learning Approach for Estimating Air Data Parameters of Small Fixed-Wing UAVs Using Distributed Pressure Sensors,"This paper presents a method for estimating the air data parameters for a small fixed-wing, unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) using an arrangement of low-cost Micro-electromechinal systems (MEMS)-based pressure sensors embedded in the surface of the UAV. The pressure measurements are used in a machine learning (ML) model to estimate the angle of attack, sideslip angle, and airspeed. Two ML algorithms based on artificial neural networks (NNs) and linear regression (LR) are implemented, tested, and assessed using data collected from wind tunnel experiments and a flight test, and the results are compared to a benchmark flight test. Training the ML algorithms using wind tunnel data was found to introduce several potential error sources that need to be addressed in order to provide accurate estimation on the benchmark flight test, whereas training the algorithms using flight data provides lower estimation RMSE values. The performance of the NN structures has been found to slightly outperform the LR algorithms in estimation accuracy. Finally, results from using different sensor configurations and a pseudo-Reynolds number are presented in an effort to evaluate the influence of sensor number and placement on the accuracy of the method.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8859289,IEEE Transactions on Aerospace and Electronic Systems,2020-01-01

"Editorial: Industrial Internet: Security, Architectures, and Technologies","Industrial Internet is applicable across a broad industrial spectrum including manufacturing, aviation, road and rail transport, power, oil and gas, healthcare, smart cities and buildings.

Pricing Data Tampering in Automated Fare Collection with NFC-Equipped Smartphones,"Automated Fare Collection (AFC) systems have been globally deployed for decades, particularly in the public transportation network where the transit fee is calculated based on the length of the trip (a.k.a., distance-based pricing AFC systems). Although most messages of AFC systems are insecurely transferred in plaintext, system operators did not pay much attention to this vulnerability, since the AFC network is basically isolated from the public network (e.g., the Internet)-there is no way of exploiting such a vulnerability from the outside of the AFC network. Nevertheless, in recent years, the advent of Near Field Communication (NFC)-equipped smartphones has opened up a channel to invade into the AFC network from the mobile Internet, i.e., by Host-based Card Emulation (HCE) over NFC-equipped smartphones. In this paper, we identify a novel paradigm of attacks, called LessPay, against modern distance-based pricing AFC systems, enabling users to pay much less than what they are supposed to be charged. The identified attack has two important properties: 1) it is invisible to AFC system operators because the attack never causes any inconsistency in the back-end database of the operators; and 2) it can be scalable to affect a large number of users (e.g., 10,000) by only requiring a moderate-sized AFC card pool (e.g., containing 150 cards). To evaluate the efficacy of the attack, we developed an HCE app to launch the LessPay attack; and the real-world experiments demonstrate not only the feasibility of the LessPay attack (with 97.6 percent success rate) but also its low cost in terms of bandwidth and computation. Finally, we propose, implement and evaluate four types of countermeasures, and present security analysis and comparison of these countermeasures on defending against the LessPay attack.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8404117,IEEE Transactions on Mobile Computing,2019-05-01
A Robust Load Balancing and Routing Protocol for Intra-Car Hybrid Wired/Wireless Networks,"With the emergence of connected and autonomous vehicles, sensors are increasingly deployed within cars to support new functionalities. Traffic generated by these sensors congest traditional intra-car networks, such as CAN buses. Furthermore, the large amount of wires needed to connect sensors makes it harder to design cars in a modular way. To alleviate these limitations, we propose, simulate, and implement a hybrid wired/wireless architecture, in which each node is connected to either a wired interface or a wireless interface or both. Specifically, we propose a new protocol, called Hybrid-Backpressure Collection Protocol (Hybrid-BCP), to efficiently collect data from sensors in intra-car networks. Hybrid-BCP is backward-compatible with the CAN bus technology, and builds on the BCP protocol, designed for wireless sensor networks. We theoretically prove that an idealized version of Hybrid-BCP achieves optimal throughput. Our testbed implementation, based on CAN and ZigBee transceivers, demonstrates the load balancing and routing functionalities of Hybrid-BCP and its resilience to DoS attacks and wireless jamming attacks. We further provide simulation results, obtained with the ns-3 simulator and based on real intra-car RSSI traces, that compare between the performance of Hybrid-BCP and a tree-based data collection protocol. Notably, the simulations show that Hybrid-BCP outperforms the tree-based protocol on throughput by 12 percent. The results also show that Hybrid-BCP maintains high packet delivery rate and low packet delay for safety-critical sensors that are directly connected to the sink through wire.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8353355,IEEE Transactions on Mobile Computing,2019-02-01
PHY-Layer Cover-Free Coding for Wireless Pilot Authentication in IoV Communications: Protocol Design and Ultra-Security Proof,"Wireless channel state information (CSI) from intelligent vehicles to the roadside unit (RSU) is a must for vehicleto-infrastructure (V2I) communications in Internet of Vehicles, but easily suffers the risks of being attacked due to the publicly known and deterministic characteristic of PHY-layer pilots that are employed for CSI acquisition. This incurs the issue of wireless pilot authentication (WPA), that is, verifying the authenticity of pilots and claimed CSIs. In this paper, we, for multiantenna V2I orthogonal frequency division multiplexed communications, develop a PHY-layer cover-free (PHY-CF) coding theory to build up a secure WPA (SWPA) protocol. Here, we encode and convey vehicle pilot signals into diversified subcarrier activation patterns (SAPs) on the time-frequency domain by employing cover-free coding. We redesign the decoding procedure using the signal independence characteristic such that those encoded SAPs, though camouflaged by malicious signals and superimposed onto each other in wireless environment, could be separated, identified and decoded into the original pilots securely. For this protocol, we prove that perfect pilot conveying and separation could be both guaranteed. We formulate the pilot identification error probability (IEP) and show how PHY-CF coding could help position the location of attacker and reduce IEP to further achieve ultrasecurity. Considering 20 MHz long-term evolution bandwidth, we prove that the number of co-time co-frequency vehicles that are securely authenticated achieves up to 19 Ã X for X serving sectors of base station type RSU and the latency time of uplink data access is up to 1.5 ms, thus furthering the autonomous driving. Computer simulations comprehensively verify those benefits of proposed SWPA protocol.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8510793,IEEE Internet of Things Journal,2019-01-01
An Efficient Authenticated Key Agreement Scheme for Consumer USB MSDs Resilient to Unauthorized File Decryption,"The Mass Storage Class (MSC) of universal serial bus (USB) interface is a collection of communication protocols that enables USB Mass Storage Device(s) [MSD(s)] to be connected with the host system for data transfer in full duplex fashion. USB_MSDs are common in use due to their affordable price, high storage capacity, and excellent transmission speed. But because of security vulnerabilities, its use is strictly prohibited in many classified and commercial environments. Authenticated key agreement between client terminal and authentication server is an essential security feature to securely store data on USB_MSD. Recently, Giri et al. proposed an authenticated key agreement scheme for USB_MSD, having session spanning file decryption characteristics. In this paper, we have reviewed and pointed out several security vulnerabilities, including unauthorized file decryption attack of the aforesaid scheme. This paper introduces the notion of unauthorized file decryption attack and defines its adversarial model. Next, an improved security protocol for USB_MSD(s) has been proposed. The formal and informal security along with Automated Validation of Internet Security Protocols and Application (AVISPA) tool verification of proposed scheme shows that it is safe against eminent attacks. The performance comparison in terms of computational complexity, communication overhead, storage space and security features showed that proposed scheme is computationally efficient and has improved security characteristics also.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8550696,IEEE Transactions on Consumer Electronics,2019-01-01
Automatic Characterization of Exploitable Faults: A Machine Learning Approach,"Characterizing the fault space of a cipher to filter out a set of faults potentially exploitable for fault attacks (FA), is a problem with immense practical value. A quantitative knowledge of the exploitable fault space is desirable in several applications, such as security evaluation, cipher construction and implementation, design, testing of countermeasures, and so on. In this paper, we investigate this problem in the context of block ciphers. The formidable size of the fault space of a block cipher mandates the use of an automation strategy to solve this problem, which should be able to characterize each individual fault instance quickly. On the other hand, the automation strategy is expected to be applicable to most of the block cipher constructions. Existing techniques for automated fault attacks do not satisfy both of these goals simultaneously, and hence are not directly applicable in the context of exploitable fault characterization. In this paper, we present a supervised machine learning assisted automated framework, which successfully addresses both of the criteria mentioned. The key idea is to extrapolate the knowledge of some existing FAs on a cipher to rapidly figure out new attack instances. Experimental validation of this idea on two state-of-the-art block ciphers - PRESENT and LED - establishes that our approach is able to provide fairly good accuracy in identifying exploitable fault instances at a reasonable cost. Utilizing this observation, we propose a statistical framework for exploitable fault space characterization, which can provide an estimate of the success rate of an attacker corresponding to the given fault model and fault location. The framework also returns test vectors leading toward successful attacks. As a potential application, the effect of different S-Boxes on the fault space of a cipher is evaluated utilizing the framework.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8452997,IEEE Transactions on Information Forensics and Security,2019-01-01
TCALAS: Temporal Credential-Based Anonymous Lightweight Authentication Scheme for Internet of Drones Environment,"A user (external party) is interested in accessing the real-time data from some designated drones of a particular fly zone in the Internet of Drones (IoD) deployment. However, to provide this facility, the user needs to be authenticated by an accessed remote drone and vice-versa. After successful authentication both parties can establish a secret session key for the secure communication. To handle this important problem in IoD environment, we design a novel temporal credential based anonymous lightweight user authentication mechanism for IoD environment, called TCALAS. A detailed security analysis using formal security under the broadly applied real-or-random (ROR) model, formal security verification under the broadly used software verification tool, known as automated validation of internet security protocols and applications, and also informal security analysis reveal that TCALAS has the capability to resist various known attacks against passive/active adversary. In addition, a detailed comparative study has been conducted for TCALAS and other related schemes, and the study also reveals that TCALAS provides better security and functionality features, and lower costs in both computation and communication as compared to existing schemes.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8693567,IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology,2019-01-01
Cognitive Risk Control for Anti-Jamming V2V Communications in Autonomous Vehicle Networks,"The future of intelligent transportation system (ITS) is expected to be composed of connected and autonomous vehicles (CAVs), the development of which will have great impact on people's everyday life. Unfortunately, this progress will be accompanied by all kinds of potential threats and attacks rising in CAV network. As a legacy from traditional wireless networks, jamming attack is still one of the major and serious threats to vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) communications. In this paper, we investigate the anti-jamming V2V communication in CAV networks through power control in conjunction with channel selection. Bringing into play a brain-inspired research tool called cognitive dynamic system (CDS), the general structure of cognitive risk control (CRC) is well-tailored to analyze and address the jamming problem. Specifically, power control is carried out first using reinforcement learning, the result of which is then examined by a module called task-switch control. Based on the risk assessment, a multi-armed bandit (MAB) problem is formulated to perform the channel-selection process when necessary. Through continuous perception-action cycles (PACs), the feature of predictive adaptation is realized for the legitimate vehicle in its behavioral interactions with the jammer. Simulation results have shown that the proposed method has desirable performance in terms of several evaluation metrics.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8805437,IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology,2019-01-01
Detecting Vehicle Anomaly in the Edge via Sensor Consistency and Frequency Characteristic,"Autonomous vehicles are expected to significantly enhance the human mobility. However, recently researchers have discovered and demonstrated some attacks on vehicles, which have caused a panic among the public. Furthermore, these attacks have demonstrated that the security issue is still one of the major challenges of vehicles. In this paper, we propose a novel edge computing based anomaly detection, coined edge computing based vehicle anomaly detection (EVAD), which exploits edge based sensor data fusion to identify the anomaly events. The time domain property, i.e., the correlation between different intra-vehicle sensors, and the frequency domain property of sensor data are utilized to judge whether an anomaly has occurred within the vehicle. Especially, to reduce the computation overhead and improve the performance, multiple sensors will be organized as ring architecture, which is a tradeoff of detection accuracy and complexity. In addition, the major components (e.g., anomaly detection module) of EVAD are embedded in edge computing devices, which make the anomaly detection be more efficient and privacy preserving. Meanwhile, a more appropriate model is generated on the cloud server, of which computation overhead maybe heavy for edge computing devices. This paper evaluates the performance of EVAD under different scenarios, and the experimental results demonstrate its feasibility and efficiency. The average true positive rate achieves 99.5% with 1% false positive rate.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8675434,IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology,2019-01-01
Locating Multiple GPS Jammers Using Networked UAVs,"Recent technologies, such as, Internet of Things and cloud services, increases the usage of small and low-cost networked unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), which needs to be robust against malicious global positioning system (GPS) attacks. Due to the availability of low-cost GPS jammers in the commercial market, there has been a rising risk of multiple jammers and not just one. However, it is challenging to locate multiple jammers because the traditional jammer localization via multilateration is applicable for only a single jammer case. Also, during a jamming attack, the positioning capability of an on-board GPS receiver is compromised given its inability to track GPS signals. We propose a simultaneous localization of multiple jammers and receivers (SLMR) algorithm by analyzing the variation in the front-end signal power recorded by the GPS receivers on-board a network of UAVs. Our algorithm not only locates multiple jammers but also utilizes these malicious sources as additional navigation signals for positioning the UAVs. We design a Gaussian mixture probability hypothesis density filter over a graph framework, which is optimized using a Levenberg-Marquardt minimizer. Using a simulated experimental setup, we validate the convergence and localization accuracy of our SLMR algorithm for various cases, including attacks with a single jammer, multiple jammers, and a varying number of jammers. We also demonstrate that our SLMR algorithm is able to simultaneously locate multiple jammers and UAVs, even for a larger transmitted power of the jammers.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8629980,IEEE Internet of Things Journal,2019-01-01
Design and Analysis of Secure Lightweight Remote User Authentication and Key Agreement Scheme in Internet of Drones Deployment,"The Internet of Drones (IoD) provides a coordinated access to unmanned aerial vehicles that are referred as drones. The on-going miniaturization of sensors, actuators, and processors with ubiquitous wireless connectivity makes drones to be used in a wide range of applications ranging from military to civilian. Since most of the applications involved in the IoD are real-time based, the users are generally interested in accessing real-time information from drones belonging to a particular fly zone. This happens if we allow users to directly access real-time data from flying drones inside IoD environment and not from the server. This is a serious security breach which may deteriorate performance of any implemented solution in this IoD environment. To address this important issue in IoD, we propose a novel lightweight user authentication scheme in which a user in the IoD environment needs to access data directly from a drone provided that the user is authorized to access the data from that drone. The formal security verification using the broadly accepted automated validation of Internet security protocols and applications tool along with informal security analysis show that our scheme is secure against several known attacks. The performance comparison demonstrates that our scheme is efficient with respect to various parameters, and it provides better security as compared to those for the related existing schemes. Finally, the practical demonstration of our scheme is done using the widely accepted NS2 simulation.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8581510,IEEE Internet of Things Journal,2019-01-01
Parallel planning: a new motion planning framework for autonomous driving,"Motion planning is one of the most significant technologies for autonomous driving. To make motion planning models able to learn from the environment and to deal with emergency situations, a new motion planning framework called as â parallel planning â is proposed in this paper. In order to generate sufficient and various training samples, artificial traffic scenes are firstly constructed based on the knowledge from the reality. A deep planning model which combines a convolutional neural network ( CNN ) with the Long Short-Term Memory module ( LSTM ) is developed to make planning decisions in an end-to-end mode. This model can learn from both real and artificial traffic scenes and imitate the driving style of human drivers. Moreover, a parallel deep reinforcement learning approach is also presented to improve the robustness of planning model and reduce the error rate. To handle emergency situations, a hybrid generative model including a variational auto-encoder ( VAE ) and a generative adversarial network ( GAN ) is utilized to learn from virtual emergencies generated in artificial traffic scenes. While an autonomous vehicle is moving, the hybrid generative model generates multiple video clips in parallel, which correspond to different potential emergency scenarios. Simultaneously, the deep planning model makes planning decisions for both virtual and current real scenes. The final planning decision is determined by analysis of real observations. Leveraging the parallel planning approach, the planner is able to make rational decisions without heavy calculation burden when an emergency occurs.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8405356,IEEE/CAA Journal of Automatica Sinica,2019-01-01
Blockchain-Based Mutual-Healing Group Key Distribution Scheme in Unmanned Aerial Vehicles Ad-Hoc Network,"A dynamic group key is required for secure communication in the Unmanned Aerial Vehicles Ad-Hoc Network (UAANET). However, due to the unreliable wireless channel and high-dynamic topology of UAANET, the situation that a node is missing certain group key broadcast messages occurs frequently. Existing group key distribution schemes cannot be directly applied to the UAANET, because of their poor security or real-time. Therefore, we present a mutual-healing group key distribution scheme based on the blockchain. Firstly, the Ground Control Station (GCS) builds a private blockchain where the group keys distributed by GCS are recorded. Meanwhile, through the blockchain, a dynamic list of UAANET membership certificates is also managed. According to different attack models, a basic mutual-healing protocol and an enhanced one are designed based on the Longest-Lost-Chain mechanism to recover the node's lost group keys with the aid of its neighbors. Security analysis and extensive experiments show that, compared with the existing mutual-healing schemes, our proposed solution can effectively resist various attacks with small overhead on time and storage.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8846098,IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology,2019-01-01
AKM-IoV: Authenticated Key Management Protocol in Fog Computing-Based Internet of Vehicles Deployment,"Internet of Vehicles (IoV) is an intelligent application of Internet of Things (IoT) in smart transportation that takes intelligent commitments to the passengers to improve traffic safety and efficiency, and generate a more enjoyable driving and riding environment. Fog cloud-based IoV is another variant of mobile cloud computing where vehicular cloud and Internet can co-operate in more effective way in IoV. However, more increasing dependence on wireless communication, control, and computing technology makes IoV more dangerous to prospective attacks. For secure communication among vehicles, road-side units, fog and cloud servers, we design a secure authenticated key management protocol in fog computing-based IoV deployment, called AKM-IoV. In the designed AKM-IoV, after mutual authentication between communicating entities in IoV they establish session keys for secure communications. AKM-IoV is tested for its security analysis using the formal security analysis under the widely accepted real-or-random (ROR) model, informal, and formal security verification using the broadly accepted automated validation of Internet security protocols and applications (AVISPAs) tool. The practical demonstration of AKM-IoV is shown using the NS2 simulation. In addition, a detailed comparative study is conducted to show the efficiency and functionality and security features supported by AKM-IoV as compared to other existing recent protocols.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8740937,IEEE Internet of Things Journal,2019-01-01
Coastal SLAM With Marine Radar for USV Operation in GPS-Restricted Situations,"The global positioning system (GPS) has become an indispensable navigation sensor for field operations with unmanned surface vehicles (USVs) in marine environments. However, GPS may not always be available, even in open outdoor areas, because it is vulnerable to natural interference and malicious jamming attacks. Thus, an alternative navigation system is required when the use of GPS is restricted or prohibited. In such circumstances, a marine radar, which is a standard sensor in a marine vehicle including USV, can be used for localization in coastal areas. The marine radar can extract landmark features of the surrounding coastlines. These features can be utilized for relative navigation with respect to the detected coastlines. However, coastline maps based on radar signatures may be unavailable in unexplored areas, and they may be unreliable in coastal areas with high tidal elevations. In this study, the relative navigation with respect to the surrounding coastlines is performed in the framework of simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM) for a USV operation in coastal waters. In particular, coastline features are parameterized by using B-splines for efficient map management, instead of the conventional point cloud representation. To verify and demonstrate the performance of the proposed coastal SLAM algorithm, field experiments were conducted in actual coastal environments. The results are presented and discussed in this paper.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8600301,IEEE Journal of Oceanic Engineering,2019-01-01
Physical-Layer Security of 5G Wireless Networks for IoT: Challenges and Opportunities,"The fifth generation (5G) wireless technologies serve as a key propellent to meet the increasing demands of the future Internet of Things (IoT) networks. For wireless communication security in 5G IoT networks, physical-layer security (PLS) has recently received growing interest. This paper aims to provide a comprehensive survey of the PLS techniques in 5G IoT communication systems. The investigation consists of four hierarchical parts. In the first part, we review the characteristics of 5G IoT under typical application scenarios. We then introduce the security threats from the 5G IoT physical-layer and categorize them according to the different purposes of the attacker. In the third part, we examine the 5G communication technologies in 5G IoT systems and discuss their challenges and opportunities when coping with physical-layer threats, including massive multiple-input-multiple-output (MIMO), millimeter wave (mmWave) communications, nonorthogonal multiple access (NOMA), full-duplex technology, energy harvesting (EH), visible light communication (VLC), and unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) communications. Finally, we discuss open research problems and future works about PLS in the IoT system with technologies of 5G and beyond.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8758230,IEEE Internet of Things Journal,2019-01-01
Design and Evaluation of UAV Flow Angle Estimation Filters,"This paper presents the design, implementation, and evaluation of four filters for the estimation of angle of attack (AOA) and angle of sideslip (AOS) of small unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs). Specifically, two novel filters (a complementary filter and an extended Kalman filter) are proposed and evaluated without using direct flow angle and Global Positioning System measurements; two existing AOA/AOS filters are also implemented and evaluated. All filters are designed with minimal inputs and states to ensure the ease of implementation, simplicity of tuning, and computation efficiency. Both simulation and UAV flight test results show the performance of the proposed filters. Especially, flight test results from two different UAVs (a T-tail UAV and a flying wing UAV) show that the root mean square errors of estimated inertial AOA and AOS are less than 1.5Â° under nominal flight conditions and around 2Â° under aggressive maneuvers compared with direct flow angle measurements.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8401906,IEEE Transactions on Aerospace and Electronic Systems,2019-01-01
A Trust-Based Active Detection for Cyber-Physical Security in Industrial Environments,"For the cyber-physical systems (CPS) in the smart industrial environments, a larger amount of smart sensor nodes, processors and actuators are deployed to sense information from physical world, which is vulnerable to be attacked because the nodes are deployed in unattended areas. Security is a pivotal issue for CPS, therefore, a trust-based active detection (TBAD) scheme is proposed for improving the reliability of collecting data packets and reducing the data redundancy. In TBAD scheme, the trust of the nodes is evaluated by the neighboring nodes and the evaluation results are added into the header of data packets. Thus, according to the reliability of data packets collected by the unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV), the trust of sensor nodes is evaluated by the UAV. In addition, the evaluation trust of nodes stored in the header of data packets will be detected when the UAV suspects the stored trust of sensor nodes. Then, the trust of corresponding sensor nodes is adjusted according to the detection results. The sensor nodes with higher trust are selected to form movement trajectory. A series of simulation experiments are conducted to evaluate the performance of the scheme. The results illustrate that the proposed scheme can greatly improve the efficiency and security of data routing in CPS.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8787570,IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics,2019-01-01
Covert Spoofing Algorithm of UAV Based on GPS/INS-Integrated Navigation,"A covert spoofing algorithm of an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) based on GPS/inertial-navigation-system-integrated navigation is analyzed in this paper. The proposed algorithm theoretically proves the fact that when the acceleration component of the counterfeit GPS signal is the difference between the UAV's current acceleration and the spoofing control input, the UAV can be covert spoofed. To avoid adverse consequences (detection or crash) caused by frequent changes in UAV flight during the GPS spoofing attacks, the proposed algorithm requires that the deception trajectory planned by the GPS spoofer is slowly changing relative to the reference trajectory, which is pre-set by the UAV. Simulation results have verified the correctness of the proposed covert spoofing algorithm of UAV. Moreover, the spoofing effect is more distinct when the deception trajectory planning is considered.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8704896,IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology,2019-01-01
iSTRICT: An Interdependent Strategic Trust Mechanism for the Cloud-Enabled Internet of Controlled Things,"The cloud-enabled Internet of controlled things (IoCT) envisions a network of sensors, controllers, and actuators connected through a local cloud in order to intelligently control physical devices. Because cloud services are vulnerable to advanced persistent threats (APTs), each device in the IoCT must strategically decide whether to trust cloud services that may be compromised. In this paper, we present iSTRICT, an interdependent strategic trust mechanism for the cloud-enabled IoCT. iSTRICT is composed of three interdependent layers. In the cloud layer, iSTRICT uses FlipIt games to conceptualize APTs. In the communication layer, it captures the interaction between devices and the cloud using signaling games. In the physical layer, iSTRICT uses optimal control to quantify the utilities in the higher level games. Best response dynamics link the three layers in an overall âgame-of-games,â for which the outcome is captured by a concept called Gestalt Nash equilibrium (GNE). We prove the existence of a GNE under a set of natural assumptions and develop an adaptive algorithm to iteratively compute the equilibrium. Finally, we apply iSTRICT to trust management for autonomous vehicles that rely on measurements from remote sources. We show that strategic trust in the communication layer achieves a worst-case probability of compromise for any attack and defense costs in the cyber layer.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8543871,IEEE Transactions on Information Forensics and Security,2019-01-01
Security Implications of Intentional Capacitive Crosstalk,"With advances in shrinking process technology sizes, the parasitic effects of closely routed adjacent wires, crosstalk, still present problems in practice since they directly influence performance and functionality. Even though there is a solid understanding of parasitic effects in hardware designs, the security implications of such undesired effects have been scarcely investigated. In this paper, we leverage the physical routing effects of capacitive crosstalk to demonstrate a new parametric hardware Trojan design methodology. We show that such Trojans can be implemented by only rerouting already existing resources. Thus, our approach possesses a zero-gate area overhead which is both stealthy and challenging to detect with standard visual inspection techniques. In two case studies, we demonstrate its devastating consequences: (1) we realize an implementation attack on a third-party cryptographic AES IP core and (2) we realize a privilege escalation on a general-purpose processor capable of running any modern operating system. In these case studies, we take special care to ensure that the Trojans do not violate design rule checks, which further highlights that the capacitive crosstalk Trojans can be building blocks for malicious circuitry design. We then investigate how state-of-the-art visual inspection techniques can be enhanced to cope with parametric hardware Trojans. In particular, we develop an automated layout-level mitigation approach which exploits the characteristic wire length of capacitive crosstalk Trojans. Finally, we highlight further implementation strategies for capacitive crosstalk Trojans and pinpoint future research directions.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8673644,IEEE Transactions on Information Forensics and Security,2019-01-01
Research on Deep Learning Techniques in Breaking Text-Based Captchas and Designing Image-Based Captcha,"The ability of hackers to infiltrate computer systems using computer attack programs and bots led to the development of Captchas or Completely Automated Public Turing Tests to Tell Computers and Humans Apart. The text Captcha is the most popular Captcha scheme given its ease of construction and user friendliness. However, the next generation of hackers and programmers has decreased the expected security of these mechanisms, leaving websites open to attack. Text Captchas are still widely used, because it is believed that the attack speeds are slow, typically two to five seconds per image, and this is not seen as a critical threat. In this paper, we introduce a simple, generic, and fast attack on text Captchas that effectively challenges that supposition. With deep learning techniques, our attack demonstrates a high success rate in breaking the Roman-character-based text Captchas deployed by the top 50 most popular international websites and three Chinese Captchas that use a larger character set. These targeted schemes cover almost all existing resistance mechanisms, demonstrating that our attack techniques are also applicable to other existing Captchas. Does this work then spell the beginning of the end for text-based Captcha? We believe so. A novel image-based Captcha named Style Area Captcha (SACaptcha) is proposed in this paper, which is based on semantic information understanding, pixel-level segmentation, and deep learning techniques. Having demonstrated that text Captchas are no longer secure, we hope that our proposal shows promise in the development of image-based Captchas using deep learning techniques.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8327894,IEEE Transactions on Information Forensics and Security,2018-01-01
Secure Message Communication Protocol Among Vehicles in Smart City,"Secure messages exchange among different vehicles is one of the most challenging tasks in future smart cities. Any malicious activity has the potential to compromise the confidentiality, integrity, and authenticity of messages exchanged between different vehicles. To ensure secure message communication among the vehicles in a smart city environment, a novel scheme using elliptic curve cryptographic (ECC) technique has been presented in this paper. For this purpose, a two-level authentication key exchange scheme has been designed. In the first level authentication, CH s are verified by series of messages exchanged between CHs and the CA. The verified CHs are responsible for authentication of vehicles in the second level authentication, followed by exchange of messages between CH and vehicle. The security analysis using widely accepted Burrows-Abadi-Needham logic, formal security analysis using random oracle model and verification using the widely known automated validation of Internet security protocols and applications (AVISPA) tool, and also the informal security analysis have been done with respect to various types of attacks. Moreover, a comparative analysis of the proposed scheme with existing related schemes reveals that it generates low overhead and latency, and high reliability during messages exchange between vehicles and the CA.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8187745,IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology,2018-01-01
"Weapon configuration, allocation and route planning with time windows for multiple unmanned combat air vehicles","Unmanned combat air vehicles (UCAVs) mission planning is a fairly complicated global optimum problem. Military attack missions often employ a fleet of UCAVs equipped with weapons to attack a set of known targets. A UCAV can carry different weapons to accomplish different combat missions. Choice of different weapons will have different effects on the final combat effectiveness. This work presents a mixed integer programming model for simultaneous weapon configuration and route planning of UCAVs, which solves the problem optimally using the IBM ILOG CPLEX optimizer for simple missions. This paper develops a heuristic algorithm to handle the medium-scale and large-scale problems. The experiments demonstrate the performance of the heuristic algorithm in solving the medium scale and large scale problems. Moreover, we give suggestions on how to select the most appropriate algorithm to solve different scale problems.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8536780,Journal of Systems Engineering and Electronics,2018-01-01
A Hierarchical Detection and Response System to Enhance Security Against Lethal Cyber-Attacks in UAV Networks,"Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) networks have not yet received considerable research attention. Specifically, security issues are a major concern because such networks, which carry vital information, are prone to various attacks. In this paper, we design and implement a novel intrusion detection and response scheme, which operates at the UAV and ground station levels, to detect malicious anomalies that threaten the network. In this scheme, a set of detection and response techniques are proposed to monitor the UAV behaviors and categorize them into the appropriate list (normal, abnormal, suspect, and malicious) according to the detected cyber-attack. We focus on the most lethal cyber-attacks that can target an UAV network, namely, false information dissemination, GPS spoofing, jamming, and black hole and gray hole attacks. Extensive simulations confirm that the proposed scheme performs well in terms of attack detection even with a large number of UAVs and attackers since it exhibits a high detection rate, a low number of false positives, and prompt detection with a low communication overhead.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7890467,"IEEE Transactions on Systems, Man, and Cybernetics: Systems",2018-01-01
Combating the Control Signal Spoofing Attack in UAV Systems,"Unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) system is vulnerable to the control signal spoofing attack due to the openness of the wireless communications. In this correspondence, a physical layer approach is proposed to combat the control signal spoofing attack, i.e., to determine whether the received control signal packet is from the ground control station or a potential malicious attacker (MA), which does not need to share any secret key. We consider the worst case where the UAV does not have any prior knowledge about the MA. Utilizing the channel feature of the angles of arrival, the distance-based path loss, and the Rician-$\kappa$ factor, we construct a generalized log-likelihood radio test framework to handle the problem. Accurate approximations of the false alarm and successful detection rate are provided to efficiently evaluate the performance.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8350330,IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology,2018-01-01
Drone Pilot Identification by Classifying Radio-Control Signals,"Analysis of interactions with remotely controlled devices has been used to detect the onset of hijacking attacks, as well as for forensics analysis, e.g., to identify the human controller. Its effectiveness is known to depend on the remote device type as well as on the properties of the remote control signal. This paper shows that the radio control signal sent to an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) using a typical transmitter can be captured and analyzed to identify the controlling pilot using machine learning techniques. Twenty trained pilots have been asked to fly a high-end research drone through three different trajectories. Control data have been collected and used to train multiple classifiers. Best performance has been achieved by a random forest classifier that achieved accuracy around 90% using simple time-domain features. Extensive tests have shown that the classification accuracy depends on the flight trajectory and that the pitch, roll, yaw, and thrust control signals show different levels of significance for pilot identification. This result paves the way to a number of security and forensics applications, including continuous identification of UAV pilots to mitigate the risk of hijacking.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8323415,IEEE Transactions on Information Forensics and Security,2018-01-01
User-Centric View of Unmanned Aerial Vehicle Transmission Against Smart Attacks,"Unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) systems are vulnerable to smart attackers, who are selfish and subjective end-users and use smart radio devices to change their attack types and policies based on the ongoing UAV transmission and network states. In this paper, we apply prospect theory to formulate a subjective smart attack game for the UAV transmission, in which a smart attacker Eve makes subjective decisions to choose the attack type such as jamming, spoofing, and eavesdropping without knowing the attack detection accuracy of the UAV system, and the UAV transmit power on multiple radio channels is chosen to resist smart attacks. Reinforcement-learning-based UAV power allocation strategies are proposed to achieve the optimal power allocation against smart attacks without knowing the attack model and the channel model in the dynamic game. A deep Q-learning-based UAV power allocation strategy combines Q-learning and deep learning to accelerate the learning speed for the case with a large number of channel states and attack modes. Simulation results show that our proposed UAV power allocation strategy can suppress the attack motivation of subjective smart attackers and increase the secrecy capacity and the utility of the UAV system.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8231220,IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology,2018-01-01
Secure Automated Valet Parking: A Privacy-Preserving Reservation Scheme for Autonomous Vehicles,"It is believed that automated valet parking (AVP) system has great potential to mitigate the parking headache for the future smart city, as it can provide on-demand parking services, bringing immense benefits from energy saving for vehicles to time saving for drivers. For an AVP system, parking reservation is an indispensable part so that vehicles can accomplish automated parking in accordance with the reserved parking information. However, the reservation requests may not only reveal the driver identity, but also disclose his/her sensitive locations, e.g., the most visited places, which are of great concerns to users. To deal with this challenge, the anonymous techniques can be naturally applied during parking reservation, but directly applying the anonymous techniques in AVP will introduce a new security issue, i.e., the anonymous user may maliciously crash the AVP system by repetitively sending the reservation requests, which is called âdouble-reservation attack.â In this paper, we propose a new privacy-preserving reservation scheme for securing AVP system. Specifically, each anonymous user must have only one valid reservation token at any moment, and the token can only be used for booking one vacant parking space once. The proposed scheme does not only preserve the user's identity privacy and location privacy but also prevents the âdouble-reservation attackâ based on several elegant building blocks, i.e., zero-knowledge proofs of knowledge and proxy resignature. Detailed security analysis confirms the security properties of our proposed scheme. In addition, extensive simulations are conducted to compare our proposed scheme with three previous schemes, and the experiment results demonstrate that our scheme is also much efficient in a WiFi-based testbed.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8464286,IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology,2018-01-01
WaterGAN: Unsupervised Generative Network to Enable Real-Time Color Correction of Monocular Underwater Images,"This letter reports on WaterGAN, a generative adversarial network (GAN) for generating realistic underwater images from in-air image and depth pairings in an unsupervised pipeline used for color correction of monocular underwater images. Cameras onboard autonomous and remotely operated vehicles can capture high-resolution images to map the seafloor; however, underwater image formation is subject to the complex process of light propagation through the water column. The raw images retrieved are characteristically different than images taken in air due to effects, such as absorption and scattering, which cause attenuation of light at different rates for different wavelengths. While this physical process is well described theoretically, the model depends on many parameters intrinsic to the water column as well as the structure of the scene. These factors make recovery of these parameters difficult without simplifying assumptions or field calibration; hence, restoration of underwater images is a nontrivial problem. Deep learning has demonstrated great success in modeling complex nonlinear systems but requires a large amount of training data, which is difficult to compile in deep sea environments. Using WaterGAN, we generate a large training dataset of corresponding depth, in-air color images, and realistic underwater images. These data serve as input to a two-stage network for color correction of monocular underwater images. Our proposed pipeline is validated with testing on real data collected from both a pure water test tank and from underwater surveys collected in the field. Source code, sample datasets, and pretrained models are made publicly available.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7995024,IEEE Robotics and Automation Letters,2018-01-01
Analyzing and Enhancing the Security of Ultrasonic Sensors for Autonomous Vehicles,"Autonomous vehicles rely on sensors to measure road condition and make driving decisions, and their safety relies heavily on the reliability of these sensors. Out of all obstacle detection sensors, ultrasonic sensors have the largest market share and are expected to be increasingly installed on automobiles. Such sensors discover obstacles by emitting ultrasounds and analyzing their reflections. By exploiting the built-in vulnerabilities of sensors, we designed random spoofing, adaptive spoofing, and jamming attacks on ultrasonic sensors, and we managed to trick a vehicle to stop when it should keep moving, and let it fail to stop when it should. We validate our attacks on stand-alone sensors and moving vehicles, including a Tesla Model S with the âAutopilotâ system. The results show that the attacks cause blindness and malfunction of not only sensors but also autonomous vehicles, which can lead to collisions. To enhance the security of ultrasonic sensors and autonomous vehicles, we propose two defense strategies, single-sensor-based physical shift authentication that verifies signals on the physical level, and multiple sensor consistency check that employs multiple sensors to verify signals on the system level. Our experiments on real sensors and MATLAB simulation reveal the validity of both schemes.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8451864,IEEE Internet of Things Journal,2018-01-01
IEEE 802.11p and Visible Light Hybrid Communication Based Secure Autonomous Platoon,"Autonomous vehicle platoon is an enhancement of autonomous behavior, where vehicles are organized into groups of close proximity through wireless communication. Platoon members mostly communicate with each other via the current dominant vehicular radio frequency (RF) technology, IEEE 802.11p. However, this technology leads security vulnerabilities under various attacks from adversaries. Visible light communication (VLC) has the potential to alleviate these vulnerabilities by exploiting the directivity and impermeability of light. Utilizing only VLC in vehicle platoon, on the other hand, may degrade platoon stability since VLC is sensitive to environmental effects. In this paper, we propose an IEEE 802.11p and VLC-based hybrid security protocol for platoon communication, namely SP-VLC, with the goal of ensuring platoon stability and securing platoon maneuvers under data packet injection, channel overhearing, jamming, and platoon maneuver attacks. We define platoon maneuver attack based on the identification of various scenarios where a fake maneuver packet is transmitted by a malicious actor. SP-VLC includes mechanisms for the secret key establishment, message authentication, data transmission over both IEEE 802.11p and VLC,jamming detection and reaction to switch to VLC only communication and secure platoon maneuvering based on the joint usage of IEEE 802.11p and VLC. We develop a simulation platform combining realistic vehicle mobility model, realistic VLC and IEEE 802.11p channel models, and vehicle platoon management. We show the functionality of the SP-VLC protocol under all possible security attacks by performing extensive simulations. Ourfindings demonstrate that SPVLC protocol generates less than 0.1% difference in the speed of and distance between platoon members during security attacks in comparison to 25% and 10% in that of previously proposed IEEE 802.11p and IEEE 802.11p-VLC hybrid protocols, respectively.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8365848,IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology,2018-01-01
UAV Relay in VANETs Against Smart Jamming With Reinforcement Learning,"Frequency hopping-based antijamming techniques are not always applicable in vehicular ad hoc networks (VANETs) due to the high mobility of onboard units (OBUs) and the large-scale network topology. In this paper, we use unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) to relay the message of an OBU and improve the communication performance of VANETs against smart jammers that observe the ongoing OBU and UAV communication status and even induce the UAV to use a specific relay strategy and then attack it accordingly. More specifically, the UAV relays the OBU message to another roadside unit (RSU) with a better radio transmission condition if the serving RSU is heavily jammed or interfered. The interactions between a UAV and a smart jammer are formulated as an antijamming UAV relay game, in which the UAV decides whether or not to relay the OBU message to another RSU, and the jammer observes the UAV and the VANET strategy and chooses the jamming power accordingly. The Nash equilibria of the UAV relay game are derived to reveal how the optimal UAV relay strategy depends on the transmit cost and the UAV channel model. A hotbooting policy hill climbing-based UAV relay strategy is proposed to help the VANET resist jamming in the dynamic game without being aware of the VANET model and the jamming model. Simulation results show that the proposed relay strategy can efficiently reduce the bit error rate of the OBU message and thus increase the utility of the VANET compared with a Q-learning-based scheme.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8246580,IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology,2018-01-01
NFC Secure Element-Based Mutual Authentication and Attestation for IoT Access,"Certain resourceful and powered Internet of Things (IoT) can become victims to launch cyber attacks. Near field communication (NFC) can be used for their secure on-demand access. In this paper, we present a novel framework for the NFC secure element (SE)-based mutual authentication and attestation for IoT access with a user device such as a mobile device using NFC-based Host Card Emulation (HCE) mode for the first time. HCE is robust as compared to the other NFC modes. A cloud-based Trusted Certified Authority (TCA) manages all cryptographic credentials and stores them in the tamper-resistant SE and Trusted Platform Module (TPM)-based attestation modules on the devices. It uses a newly proposed NFC SE-based mutual authentication and attestation (NSE-AA) protocol for proof-of-locality, end-to-end anonymous mutual authentication between the SEs and an associated remote attestation for trust. The protocol is robust and lightweight as compared to the existing schemes. We provide its informal and formal security analysis using the Real-Or-Random (ROR) model. A simulation on the Automated Validation of Internet Security Protocols and Applications (AVISPA) tool proves its safety. We also briefly present the details of a prototype with a commercial mid-range priced mobile device and Single Board Computer (SBC)-based IoT device.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8477059,IEEE Transactions on Consumer Electronics,2018-01-01
Integrated guidance and control design of the suicide UCAV for terminal attack,"A novel integrated guidance and control (IGC) design method is proposed to solve problems of low control accuracy for a suicide unmanned combat aerial vehicle (UCAV) in the terminal attack stage. First of all, the IGC system model of the UCAV is built based on the three-channel independent design idea, which reduces the difsculties of designing the controller. Then, IGC control laws are designed using the trajectory linearization control (TLC). A nonlinear disturbance observer (NDO) is introduced to the IGC controller to reject various uncertainties, such as the aerodynamic parameter perturbation and the measurement error interference. The stability of the closed-loop system is proven by using the Lyapunov theorem. The performance of the proposed IGC design method is verised in a terminal attack mission of the suicide UCAV.

Cyber Threats Facing Autonomous and Connected Vehicles: Future Challenges,"Vehicles are currently being developed and sold with increasing levels of connectivity and automation. As with all networked computing devices, increased connectivity often results in a heightened risk of a cyber security attack. Furthermore, increased automation exacerbates any risk by increasing the opportunities for the adversary to implement a successful attack. In this paper, a large volume of publicly accessible literature is reviewed and compartmentalized based on the vulnerabilities identified and mitigation techniques developed. This review highlighted that the majority of studies are reactive and vulnerabilities are often discovered by friendly adversaries (white-hat hackers). Many gaps in the knowledge base were identified. Priority should be given to address these knowledge gaps to minimize future cyber security risks in the connected and autonomous vehicle sector.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7872388,IEEE Transactions on Intelligent Transportation Systems,2017-01-01
Intrusion Detection and Ejection Framework Against Lethal Attacks in UAV-Aided Networks: A Bayesian Game-Theoretic Methodology,"Advances in wireless communications and microelectronics have spearheaded the development of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), which can be used to augment a ground network composed of sensors and/or vehicles in order to increase coverage, enhance the end-to-end delay, and improve data processing. While UAV-aided networks can potentially find applications in many areas, a number of issues, particularly security, have not been readily addressed. The intrusion detection system is the most commonly used technique to detect attackers. In this paper, we focus on addressing two main issues within the context of intrusion detection and attacker ejection in UAV-aided networks, namely, activation of the intrusion monitoring process and attacker ejection. In fact, when a large number of nodes activate their monitoring processes, the incurred overhead can be substantial and, as a consequence, degrades the network performance. Therefore, a tradeoff between the intrusion detection rate and overhead is considered in this work. It is not always the best strategy to eject a node immediately when it exhibits a bad sign of malicious activities since this sign could be provisional (the node may switch to a normal behavior in the future) or be simply due to noise or unreliable communications. Thus, a dilemma between detection and false positive rates is taken into account in this paper. We propose to address these two security issues by a Bayesian game model in order to accurately detect attacks (i.e., high detection and low false positive rates) with a low overhead. Simulation results have demonstrated that our proposed security game framework does achieve reliable detection.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7549080,IEEE Transactions on Intelligent Transportation Systems,2017-01-01

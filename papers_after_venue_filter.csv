Modular Vehicle Control for Transferring Semantic Information Between Weather Conditions Using GANs,"Even though end-to-end supervised learning has shown promising results for sensorimotor control of self-driving cars, its performance is greatly affected by the weather conditions under which it was trained, showing poor generalization to unseen conditions. In this paper, we show how knowledge can be transferred using semantic maps to new weather conditions without the need to obtain new ground truth data. To this end, we propose to divide the task of vehicle control into two independent modules: a control module which is only trained on one weather condition for which labeled steering data is available, and a perception module which is used as an interface between new weather conditions and the fixed control module. To generate the semantic data needed to train the perception module, we propose to use a generative adversarial network (GAN)-based model to retrieve the semantic information for the new conditions in an unsupervised manner. We introduce a master-servant architecture, where the master model (semantic labels available) trains the servant model (semantic labels not available). We show that our proposed method trained with ground truth data for a single weather condition is capable of achieving similar results on the task of steering angle prediction as an end-to-end model trained with ground truth data of 15 different weather conditions. © CoRL 2018.

WaterGAN: Unsupervised generative network to enable real-time color correction of monocular underwater images,"This letter reports on WaterGAN, a generative adversarial network (GAN) for generating realistic underwater images from in-air image and depth pairings in an unsupervised pipeline used for color correction of monocular underwater images. Cameras onboard autonomous and remotely operated vehicles can capture high-resolution images to map the seafloor; however, underwater image formation is subject to the complex process of light propagation through the water column. The raw images retrieved are characteristically different than images taken in air due to effects, such as absorption and scattering, which cause attenuation of light at different rates for different wavelengths. While this physical process is well described theoretically, the model depends on many parameters intrinsic to the water column as well as the structure of the scene. These factors make recovery of these parameters difficult without simplifying assumptions or field calibration; hence, restoration of underwater images is a nontrivial problem. Deep learning has demonstrated great success in modeling complex nonlinear systems but requires a large amount of training data, which is difficult to compile in deep sea environments. Using WaterGAN, we generate a large training dataset of corresponding depth, in-air color images, and realistic underwater images. These data serve as input to a two-stage network for color correction of monocular underwater images. Our proposed pipeline is validated with testing on real data collected from both a pure water test tank and from underwater surveys collected in the field. Source code, sample datasets, and pretrained models are made publicly available. © 2016 IEEE.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85063306563&doi=10.1109%2fLRA.2017.2730363&partnerID=40&md5=650bb8689eaf16a0adeac50ef2d5b9e1,IEEE Robotics and Automation Letters,2018
IntentNet: Learning to Predict Intention from Raw Sensor Data,"In order to plan a safe maneuver, self-driving vehicles need to understand the intent of other traffic participants. We define intent as a combination of discrete high level behaviors as well as continuous trajectories describing future motion. In this paper we develop a one-stage detector and forecaster that exploits both 3D point clouds produced by a LiDAR sensor as well as dynamic maps of the environment. Our multi-task model achieves better accuracy than the respective separate modules while saving computation, which is critical to reduce reaction time in self-driving applications. © CoRL 2018.

UAV-assisted technique for the detection of malicious and selfish nodes in VANETs,"Detecting malicious and selfish nodes is an important task in Vehicular Adhoc NETworks (VANETs). Various proposals adopted trust management as an alternative solution since it is less costly than cryptography-based solution in terms of computation delay and mobility support. However, the existing solutions assume that, in general, the attackers have always a dishonest behavior that persists over time. This assumption may be misleading, as the attackers can behave intelligently to avoid being detected. Moreover, pseudonyms changing strategies to preserve vehicles' privacy are another issue to take into account. In this paper, a new solution for the detection of intelligent malicious behaviors based on the adaptive detection threshold is proposed. In addition to the detection of malicious nodes, our solution relies on Unmanned Aerial Vehicles to face the negative impact of pseudonym changes on the detection process. Our solution also incites attackers to behave well since any malicious behavior will be immediately detected thanks to the adaptive detection threshold adopted. Simulation results depict the high efficiency of our proposal at ensuring high ratios for both detection and packet delivery. © 2017 Elsevier Inc.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85038444675&doi=10.1016%2fj.vehcom.2017.12.001&partnerID=40&md5=bdf7e96441114d40c30ffceb00090bbc,Vehicular Communications,2018
Planning and Control for Collision-Free Cooperative Aerial Transportation,"This paper presents planning and control synthesis for multiple aerial manipulators to transport a common object. Each aerial manipulator that consists of a hexacopter and a two-degree-of-freedom robotic arm is controlled by an augmented adaptive sliding mode controller based on a closed-chain robot dynamics. We propose a motion planning algorithm by exploiting rapidly exploring random tree star (RRT∗) and dynamic movement primitives (DMPs). The desired path for each aerial manipulator is obtained by using RRT∗ with Bezier curve, which is designed to handle environmental obstacles, such as buildings or equipments. During aerial transportation, to avoid unknown obstacle, DMPs modify the trajectory based on the virtual leader-follower structure. By the combination of RRT∗ and DMPs, the cooperative aerial manipulators can carry a common object to keep reducing the interaction force between multiple robots while avoiding an obstacle in the unstructured environment. To validate the proposed planning and control synthesis, two experiments with multiple custom-made aerial manipulators are presented, which involve user-guided trajectory and RRT∗-planned trajectory tracking in unstructured environments.Note to Practitioners - This paper presents a viable approach to autonomous aerial transportation using multiple aerial manipulators equipped with a multidegree-of-freedom robotic arm. Existing approaches for cooperative manipulation based on force decomposition or impedance-based control often require a heavy or expensive force/torque sensor. However, this paper suggests a method without using a heavy or expensive force/torque sensor based on closed-chain dynamics in joint space and rapidly exploring random tree star (RRT∗) that generates the desired trajectory of aerial manipulators. Unlike conventional RRT∗, in this paper, our method can also avoid an unknown moving obstacle during aerial transportation by exploiting RRT∗ and dynamic movement primitives. The proposed planning and control synthesis is tested to demonstrate performance in a lab environment with two custom-made aerial manipulators and a common object. © 2004-2012 IEEE.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84991069474&doi=10.1109%2fTASE.2016.2605707&partnerID=40&md5=f90282bfff5e099be48a994a81c0728f,IEEE Transactions on Automation Science and Engineering,2018
Decision-Making Framework for Automated Driving in Highway Environments,"This paper presents a decision-making framework for automated driving in highway environments. The framework is capable of reliably, robustly assessing a given highway situation (with respect to the possibility of collision) and of automatically determining an appropriate maneuver for the situation. It consists of two main components: Situation assessment and strategy decision. The situation assessment component utilizes multiple complementary 'threat measures' and Bayesian networks in its calculations of 'threat levels' at the car and lane level to evaluate the possibility of collisions for a given highway traffic situation. The strategy decision component, designed to generate goal-directed and collision-free behaviors, automatically determines an appropriate maneuver in a given highway situation via a hierarchical state machine-such a machine both reduces the complexity of and extends a strategy model. The types of maneuver determined by the component include both simple maneuvers, such as slowing down to avoid collision with a vehicle in front, and complex maneuvers, such as lane changes and overtaking. The presented decision-making framework is tested and evaluated-both on a closed high-speed test track in simulated traffic with various driving scenarios and on public highways in real traffic through in-vehicle testing-to verify that it can provide sufficiently reliable performance for automated driving in highway environments in terms of safety, reliability, and robustness. © 2011 IEEE.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85018650519&doi=10.1109%2fTITS.2017.2691346&partnerID=40&md5=a978895f330dbb6d300128a864ad03dd,IEEE Transactions on Intelligent Transportation Systems,2018
Hierarchical control design for a shipboard power system with DC distribution and energy storage aboard future more-electric ships,"DC distribution is now becoming the major trend of future mobile power systems, such as more-electric aircrafts and ships. As dc distribution has different nature to the conventional ac system, a new design of well-structured control and management methods will be mandatory. In this paper, a shipboard power system with dc distribution and energy storage system (ESS) is picked as the study case. To meet the requirement of control and management of such a large-scale mobile power system, a hierarchical control design is proposed in this paper. In order to fully exploit the benefit of the ESS, as well as to overcome the limitation in controllability, a novel inverse-droop control method is proposed, in which the power sharing is according to the source characteristic, instead of their power rating. A frequency-division method is also proposed as an extension to the inverse-droop method for enabling a hybrid ESS and its autonomous operation. On the basis of the proposed methods, the control methods for management and voltage restoration levels are also proposed to establish a comprehensive control solution. Real-time simulations are carried out to validate the performance of the proposed control design under different operating conditions. When compared to more conventional droop-based approaches, the new proposal shows enhancement in efficiency. © 2005-2012 IEEE.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85034230013&doi=10.1109%2fTII.2017.2772343&partnerID=40&md5=f26cbd6481557746314386a36ec1f38d,IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics,2018
Effect of non-cooperative vehicles on path connectivity in vehicular networks: A theoretical analysis and UAV-based remedy,"A fully-connected Vehicular Ad-hoc Network (VANET) contributes tremendously to the improvement of the travel experience of commuting passengers. However, the existence of an end-to-end multi-hop path across VANET highly depends on the willingness of vehicles to cooperate with one another when it comes to data forwarding. Unlike the existing VANET connectivity studies that focused solely on fully-cooperative vehicular environments, this paper develops a mathematical model to explain the effect of non-cooperative vehicles on the end-to-end connectivity through the roadway segments of a VANET. First, this work characterizes some of the fundamental traffic-theoretic properties of VANETs in the presence of non-cooperative vehicles. Then, it proposes to alleviate the detrimental effect of non-cooperation on end-to-end path connectivity by exploiting Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) as store-carry-and-forward nodes in a VANET. Through both mathematical analysis and extensive simulations, the role that UAVs can play in enhancing end-to-end path connectivity is quantified in the context of a hybrid, UAV-assisted VANET architecture. © 2018 Elsevier Inc.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85044844778&doi=10.1016%2fj.vehcom.2018.01.005&partnerID=40&md5=acd5b9af7ff80fdc842b3b03bf9f5779,Vehicular Communications,2018
Self-Localization Based on Visual Lane Marking Maps: An Accurate Low-Cost Approach for Autonomous Driving,"Autonomous driving in public roads requires precise localization within the range of few centimeters. Even the best localization systems based on GNSS cannot always reach this level of precision, especially in an urban environment, where the signal is disturbed by surrounding buildings and artifacts. Recent works have shown the advantage of using maps as a precise, robust, and reliable way of localization. Typical approaches use the set of current readings from the vehicle sensors to estimate its position on the map. The approach presented in this paper exploits a short-range visual lane marking detector and a dead reckoning system to construct a registry of the detected back lane markings corresponding to the last 240 m driven. This information is used to search in the map the most similar section, to determine the vehicle localization in the map reference. Additional filtering is used to obtain a more robust estimation for the localization. The accuracy obtained is sufficiently high to allow autonomous driving in a narrow road. The system uses a low-cost architecture of sensors and the algorithm is light enough to run on low-power embedded architecture. © 2000-2011 IEEE.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85041470621&doi=10.1109%2fTITS.2017.2752461&partnerID=40&md5=80a05f47dd7a33987244a17495301d71,IEEE Transactions on Intelligent Transportation Systems,2018
Adaptive multi-agents synchronization for collaborative driving of autonomous vehicles with multiple communication delays,"The development of automated and coordinated driving systems (platooning) is an hot topic today for vehicles and it represents a challenging scenario that heavily relies on distributed control in the presence of wireless communication network. To actuate platooning in a safe way it is necessary to design controllers able to effectively operate on informations exchanged via Inter-Vehicular Communication (IVC) systems despite the presence of unavoidable communication impairments, such as multiple time-varying delays that affect communication links. To this aim in this paper we propose a novel distributed adaptive collaborative control strategy that exploits information coming from connected vehicles to achieve leader synchronization and we analytically demonstrate its stability with a Lyapunov-Krasovskii approach. The effectiveness of the proposed strategy is shown via numerical simulations in PLEXE, a state of the art IVC and mobility simulator that includes basic building blocks for platooning. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85037362580&doi=10.1016%2fj.trc.2017.11.009&partnerID=40&md5=0b93388b7db55ad6b8f3d95a0e427716,Transportation Research Part C: Emerging Technologies,2018
UAV collision avoidance exploitation for noncooperative trajectory modification,"Distributed collision-free trajectories are generally obtained through a continuous sharing of information between vehicles. With the intent of investigating possible sources of vulnerability in autonomous frameworks, we formalize a procedure malicious players can follow to influence other. In this paper we propose a strategy for steering a UAV towards predetermined targets. The strategy described here relies on the existence of a flight information sharing protocol (i.e. ADS-B) and predictable collision avoidance algorithms. A model predictive controller is applied to the switching system representing a pair of UAVs coupled by the presence of an imminent collision. As showed by means of numerical simulations and robot experiments, the result is a loss of autonomy on the UAV. Our results suggest the need to include the subject of our study in the discussion on safe automated airspace. © 2017 Elsevier Masson SAS",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85037811605&doi=10.1016%2fj.ast.2017.12.008&partnerID=40&md5=06eaa63f387b762cff620f78d8ca45ed,Aerospace Science and Technology,2018
AC-POCA: Anticoordination Game Based Partially Overlapping Channels Assignment in Combined UAV and D2D-Based Networks,"Device-to-device (D2D)-enabled wireless networks are becoming increasingly popular. However, in remote, rural, and disaster affected areas, it is difficult to construct such wireless networks due to the unavailability or inadequacy of cellular infrastructures. Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) can be a good candidate to promptly construct the D2D-enabled wireless network. However, the assignment of the radio channels of the nodes (i.e., UAVs and user terminals) is challenging due to the availability of only a limited number of orthogonal channels and the interference issue resulted from using arbitrary channels. Furthermore, the dynamic topology and high mobility of nodes in such a combined UAV and D2D-based network make conventional channel assignment (CA) algorithm no longer suitable. In this paper, we formally address this problem, and demonstrate how partially overlapping channels (POCs) and game theory can be exploited to alleviate the problem. In this vein, we propose a distributed anticoordination game based POC assignment algorithm referred to as AC-POCA. In our proposed AC-POCA, the nodes use only local information to play the game, and reach a steady state, uniqueness of which is verified through analysis. Also, the upper bound of AC-POCA (i.e., price of anarchy) is analytically evaluated, which is corroborated by simulation results. In addition, simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness of AC-POCA in terms of good throughput and low signaling overhead in a dynamic environment. © 1967-2012 IEEE.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85030215038&doi=10.1109%2fTVT.2017.2753280&partnerID=40&md5=3c4f1267a278b5ca855fa13b2b4f5b31,IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology,2018
Automated poisoning attacks and defenses in malware detection systems: An adversarial machine learning approach,"The evolution of mobile malware poses a serious threat to smartphone security. Today, sophisticated attackers can adapt by maximally sabotaging machine-learning classifiers via polluting training data, rendering most recent machine learning-based malware detection tools (such as DREBIN, DROIDAPIMINER, and MAMADROID) ineffective. In this paper, we explore the feasibility of constructing crafted malware samples; examine how machine-learning classifiers can be misled under three different threat models; then conclude that injecting carefully crafted data into training data can significantly reduce detection accuracy. To tackle the problem, we propose KUAFUDET, a two-phase learning enhancing approach that learns mobile malware by adversarial detection. KUAFUDET includes an offline training phase that selects and extracts features from the training set, and an online detection phase that utilizes the classifier trained by the first phase. To further address the adversarial environment, these two phases are intertwined through a self-adaptive learning scheme, wherein an automated camouflage detector is introduced to filter the suspicious false negatives and feed them back into the training phase. We finally show that KUAFUDET can significantly reduce false negatives and boost the detection accuracy by at least 15%. Experiments on more than 250,000 mobile applications demonstrate that KUAFUDET is scalable and can be highly effective as a standalone system. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85037536705&doi=10.1016%2fj.cose.2017.11.007&partnerID=40&md5=3171acfe07a4b294d223532e5b5a2d27,Computers and Security,2018
A Point-to-Ray Framework for Generating Smooth Parallel Parking Maneuvers,"The problem of generating smooth parallel parking maneuver for autonomous car-like vehicles is considered, wherein the vehicle moves forward from the starting point to an intermediate point and then traces a path backward to the parking position. Any error in accurately reaching the intermediate point leads to maneuver replanning and hence puts extra computational burden on the planner. Addressing the issue, this letter formulates the problem in a point-to-ray framework connecting the parking position to all points in a neighborhood of the intermediate point. Exploiting its asymptotic convergence, four parameter logistic (4PL) curve based S-shaped path is proposed as a solution with a single maneuver connecting the intermediate point neighborhood to the parking position. Inherent to the 4PL curve, the maneuver presents a continuous steering profile with zero steering angle at the ends. Parking slot collision avoidance and steering limit of the vehicle are satisfied by deducing closed-form analytic conditions on the two design parameters. Together with the robustness to intermediate point variation, comparison with existing approaches highlights computational and design advantages. The proposed approach is validated using a double-tracked Ackermann steering vehicle model. © 2016 IEEE.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85059528821&doi=10.1109%2fLRA.2018.2795655&partnerID=40&md5=8b020a12b2e7865006fddab2dc462144,IEEE Robotics and Automation Letters,2018
Cooperative search-attack mission planning for multi-UAV based on intelligent self-organized algorithm,"This paper proposes an intelligent self-organized algorithm (ISOA) to solve a cooperative search-attack mission planning problem for multiple unmanned aerial vehicles (multi-UAV). This algorithm adopts the distributed control architecture which divides the global optimization problem into several local optimization problems. Each UAV is able to solve its own local optimization problem, and then make the optimal decision for the multi-UAV system through the information exchange among UAVs. The search-attack mission planning process is divided into two phases, the one is waypoints generation under constraints of UAV's maneuverability, collision avoidance and maximum range, the other is path generation which takes account of the threat avoidance. In the first phase, an improved distributed ant colony optimization (ACO) algorithm is presented to carry out the mission planning and generate waypoints. Considering the range constraint of UAV, a new state transition rule is designed to guide UAV back to its initial point within the maximum flight range. In the second phase, Dubins curve is employed to smoothly connect the waypoints generated by the ACO. As for the unexpected threats during the flight, an online threat avoidance method is proposed to replan the paths. Finally, simulations are carried out to analyze the convergence performance, external responsiveness and internal scalability of the proposed ISOA for the multi-UAV search-attack mission planning problem. © 2018 Elsevier Masson SAS",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85042369612&doi=10.1016%2fj.ast.2018.01.035&partnerID=40&md5=28fe3244e6599aaad33cd115b40d2c1e,Aerospace Science and Technology,2018
Detection and Recognition of Traffic Planar Objects Using Colorized Laser Scan and Perspective Distortion Rectification,"Reliable detection and recognition of planar objects including traffic sign, street sign, and road surface in dynamic cluttered natural scenes are a big challenge for self-driving cars. In this paper, we propose a comprehensive method for planar object detection and recognition. First, the data association of LIDAR and camera is set up to acquire colorized laser scans, which simultaneously contain both color and geometrical information. Second, we combine three color spaces of RGB, HSV, and CIE L∗a∗b∗ with laser reflectivity as an aggregation-based feature vector. Third, the 3-D geometrical characteristics of planar objects that contain planarity, size, and aspect ratio are exploited to further reduce false alarm. Fourth, in order to increase robustness to any viewpoint variation, we present a new virtual camera-based rectification method to synthesize fronto-parallel views of refined object descriptors in 3-D space. Finally, experimental results achieved under a variety of challenging conditions show that integration of color space aggregation and laser reflectivity is superior to individuals. Specifically, the proposed perspective distortion rectification method remarkably eliminates false recognition error by 45.5%. Overall, the detection rate of our comprehensive method has up to 95.87% and the recognition rate even reaches 95.07% for traffic signs ranging within 100 m, with about 33.25 ms average running time per frame. © 2000-2011 IEEE.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85028506386&doi=10.1109%2fTITS.2017.2723902&partnerID=40&md5=dec616b19411a6ada4022f7d47367ae1,IEEE Transactions on Intelligent Transportation Systems,2018
UAV relay in VANETs against smart jamming with reinforcement learning,"Frequency hopping-based antijamming techniques are not always applicable in vehicular ad hoc networks (VANETs) due to the high mobility of onboard units (OBUs) and the large-scale network topology. In this paper, we use unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) to relay the message of an OBU and improve the communication performance of VANETs against smart jammers that observe the ongoing OBU and UAV communication status and even induce the UAV to use a specific relay strategy and then attack it accordingly. More specifically, the UAV relays the OBU message to another roadside unit (RSU) with a better radio transmission condition if the serving RSU is heavily jammed or interfered. The interactions between a UAV and a smart jammer are formulated as an antijamming UAV relay game, in which the UAV decides whether or not to relay the OBU message to another RSU, and the jammer observes the UAV and the VANET strategy and chooses the jamming power accordingly. The Nash equilibria of the UAV relay game are derived to reveal how the optimal UAV relay strategy depends on the transmit cost and the UAV channel model. A hotbooting policy hill climbing-based UAV relay strategy is proposed to help the VANET resist jamming in the dynamic game without being aware of the VANET model and the jamming model. Simulation results show that the proposed relay strategy can efficiently reduce the bit error rate of the OBU message and thus increase the utility of the VANET compared with a Q-learning-based scheme. © 1967-2012 IEEE.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85040060097&doi=10.1109%2fTVT.2018.2789466&partnerID=40&md5=cd7f68e58b9d918858a0f2df30e81fbe,IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology,2018
User-Centric View of Unmanned Aerial Vehicle Transmission Against Smart Attacks,"Unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) systems are vulnerable to smart attackers, who are selfish and subjective end-users and use smart radio devices to change their attack types and policies based on the ongoing UAV transmission and network states. In this paper, we apply prospect theory to formulate a subjective smart attack game for the UAV transmission, in which a smart attacker Eve makes subjective decisions to choose the attack type such as jamming, spoofing, and eavesdropping without knowing the attack detection accuracy of the UAV system, and the UAV transmit power on multiple radio channels is chosen to resist smart attacks. Reinforcement-learning-based UAV power allocation strategies are proposed to achieve the optimal power allocation against smart attacks without knowing the attack model and the channel model in the dynamic game. A deep Q-learning-based UAV power allocation strategy combines Q-learning and deep learning to accelerate the learning speed for the case with a large number of channel states and attack modes. Simulation results show that our proposed UAV power allocation strategy can suppress the attack motivation of subjective smart attackers and increase the secrecy capacity and the utility of the UAV system. © 1967-2012 IEEE.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85039779712&doi=10.1109%2fTVT.2017.2785414&partnerID=40&md5=8debfcc53b21736d38e8459292ab92a0,IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology,2018
Picking on the family: Disrupting android malware triage by forcing misclassification,"Machine learning classification algorithms are widely applied to different malware analysis problems because of their proven abilities to learn from examples and perform relatively well with little human input. Use cases include the labelling of malicious samples according to families during triage of suspected malware. However, automated algorithms are vulnerable to attacks. An attacker could carefully manipulate the sample to force the algorithm to produce a particular output. In this paper we discuss one such attack on Android malware classifiers. We design and implement a prototype tool, called IagoDroid, that takes as input a malware sample and a target family, and modifies the sample to cause it to be classified as belonging to this family while preserving its original semantics. Our technique relies on a search process that generates variants of the original sample without modifying their semantics. We tested IagoDroid against RevealDroid, a recent, open source, Android malware classifier based on a variety of static features. IagoDroid successfully forces misclassification for 28 of the 29 representative malware families present in the DREBIN dataset. Remarkably, it does so by modifying just a single feature of the original malware. On average, it finds the first evasive sample in the first search iteration, and converges to a 100% evasive population within 4 iterations. Finally, we introduce RevealDroid*, a more robust classifier that implements several techniques proposed in other adversarial learning domains. Our experiments suggest that RevealDroid* can correctly detect up to 99% of the variants generated by IagoDroid. © 2017 The Authors",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85035063925&doi=10.1016%2fj.eswa.2017.11.032&partnerID=40&md5=2f3a9bd5a36007876eb18fe0c73976f8,Expert Systems with Applications,2018
Asynchronous Stochastic Approximation Based Learning Algorithms for As-You-Go Deployment of Wireless Relay Networks Along a Line,"We are motivated by the need, in emergency situations, for impromptu (or 'as-you-go') deployment of multihop wireless networks, by human agents or robots (e.g., unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs)); the agent moves along a line, makes wireless link quality measurements at regular intervals, and makes on-line placement decisions using these measurements. As a first step, we have formulated such deployment along a line as a sequential decision problem. In our earlier work, reported in [1] , we proposed two possible deployment approaches: (i) the pure as-you-go approach where the deployment agent can only move forward, and (ii) the explore-forward approach where the deployment agent explores a few successive steps and then selects the best relay placement location among them. The latter was shown to provide better performance (in terms of network cost, network performance, and power expenditure), but at the expense of more measurements and deployment time, which makes explore-forward impractical for quick deployment by an energy constrained agent such as a UAV. Further, since in emergency situations the terrain would be unknown, the deployment algorithm should not require a-priori knowledge of the parameters of the wireless propagation model. In [1] , we, therefore, developed learning algorithms for the explore-forward approach. The current paper fills in an important gap by providing deploy-and-learn algorithms for the pure as-you-go approach. We formulate the sequential relay deployment problem as an average cost Markov decision process (MDP), which trades off among power consumption, link outage probabilities, and the number of relay nodes in the deployed network. While the pure as-you-go deployment problem was previously formulated as a discounted cost MDP (see [1] ), the discounted cost MDP formulation was not amenable for learning algorithms that are proposed in this paper. In this paper, first we show structural results for the optimal policy corresponding to the average cost MDP, and provide new insights into the optimal policy. Next, by exploiting the special structure of the average cost optimality equation and by using the theory of asynchronous stochastic approximation (in single and two timescale), we develop two learning algorithms that asymptotically converge to the set of optimal policies as deployment progresses. Numerical results show reasonably fast speed of convergence, and hence the model-free algorithms can be useful for practical, fast deployment of emergency wireless networks. © 2002-2012 IEEE.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85030219772&doi=10.1109%2fTMC.2017.2750147&partnerID=40&md5=eb77eab255d331019c6051a94c80946c,IEEE Transactions on Mobile Computing,2018
Collision-Aware Resource Access Scheme for LTE-Based Machine-to-Machine Communications,"Long-term evolution (LTE) network is considered as the most promising infrastructure to provide efficient connectivity for a large number of autonomous machine-type communications devices (MTCDs). In order to improve the random access (RA) throughput of massive access machine-to-machine (M2M) communications over LTE networks, we propose a collision-aware resource access (CARA) scheme to reduce the collisions on the granted physical resource blocks (PRBs). In CARA, the evolved Node B exploits early collision detection of preambles at the first message and informs the MTCDs in the corresponding random access response (RAR) message if it can detect the collision successfully. The collided MTCDs then contend for PRBs access using an appropriate probability for efficient use of granted PRBs. Analytical and numerical performance evaluations of the CARA show that the RA throughput can be improved in comparison with the traditional RA procedure. © 1967-2012 IEEE.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85041212303&doi=10.1109%2fTVT.2018.2793101&partnerID=40&md5=e18be4775587e71f9bedcd98d8e7dcfd,IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology,2018
An Evaluation of Stochastic Model-Dependent and Model-Independent Glider Flight Management,"This paper develops and compares two stochastic strategies that manage glider flight in a dynamic environment, to tackle an open problem concerning the necessity, applicability, complexity, and validity of using an environment model when making flight management decisions. Strategy performance is compared on two surveillance and pursuit tasks that require optimal control: the maximization of expected range while maintaining altitude within given limits, and the maximization of expected range while following a moving ground vehicle within a prescribed distance and maintaining altitude within given limits. Both tasks involve flight management decisions of glider airspeed and the time-to-spend climbing in a randomly encountered thermal. The first strategy is stochastic drift counteraction optimal control (SDCOC), a dynamic programming method that relies on a model. Here, SDCOC uses a computationally inexpensive yet accurate environment model that reflects transition probabilities between updrafts and downdrafts as well as thermal locations and strengths based on existing glider flight data. The second strategy is selective evolutionary generation, a model-free Markov chain Monte Carlo method that is not subject to the curse of dimensionality, efficiently searches for an optimal control in an online and tunable fashion, and easily adapts to a dynamic environment. However, this strategy requires a tolerance for learning and decision-space exploration. Both strategies perform satisfactorily, and showcase an environment/decision-space exploitation-exploration tradeoff. © 2017 IEEE.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85019905138&doi=10.1109%2fTCST.2017.2692723&partnerID=40&md5=bde2ecf6649047ad234d755aab2fe4d7,IEEE Transactions on Control Systems Technology,2018
An Adaptive Spacing Policy Guaranteeing String Stability in Multi-Brand Ad Hoc Platoons,"A method is presented for the longitudinal control of autonomous vehicles forming a multi-brand, ad hoc platoon. A leader and predecessor following (LPF) control architecture is known to allow string stable platooning with shorter safety gaps between vehicles as compared with predecessor following schemes. General LPF strategies, however, require the exact knowledge of spacing policies of predecessor vehicles for correctly specifying a spacing with respect to the leader. It follows that arbitrary spacing policies in ad hoc platoons prevent the applicability of classical LPF control structures. It is shown in this paper that it is possible to exploit the advantages of LPF architectures in multi-brand platoons without a priori knowledge of spacing policies of predecessors. The unknown spacing policies are replaced by a virtual one, which serves as an input to a two degree of freedom LPF controller. The resulting control structure enables the organization of ad hoc platoons consisting of vehicles with different spacing policies. Computer simulations are presented to illustrate the statements. © 2000-2011 IEEE.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85030769065&doi=10.1109%2fTITS.2017.2749607&partnerID=40&md5=75d3d02932468df6757699564072900c,IEEE Transactions on Intelligent Transportation Systems,2018
Vehicle Positioning in GNSS-Deprived Urban Areas by Stereo Visual-Inertial Odometry,"Accurate and continuous positioning in global navigation satellite system (GNSS) deprived urban areas is crucial for autonomous vehicles and mobile mapping systems. To achieve this goal, we propose a stereo visual-inertial odometry approach using a multistate constraint Kalman filter (MSCKF). In contrast with the conventional MSCKF, in which an inertial navigation system (INS) propagates the vehicle motion, and then the propagation is corrected by measurements of salient features extracted from images of a single camera, we update the propagation with observations extracted from images of a stereo pair of cameras. This way, additional constraints across the stereo pairs of images are exploited to improve the pose estimation. Experimental results on several KITTI datasets show that the stereo MSCKF outperforms the mono one achieving an average positioning error of 0.9% of the trajectory length compared to 1.3% for the mono approach and 2.5% for INS-only integration. These results show that visual-inertial odometry has a promising potential for vehicle positioning in short periods of GNSS signal outage. © 2016 IEEE.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85053558779&doi=10.1109%2fTIV.2018.2804168&partnerID=40&md5=fb409b22891ed5047674281b97db35ec,IEEE Transactions on Intelligent Vehicles,2018

Its solution, together with the back-stepping and the forwarding control design methods, is exploited in the control of the nonlinear lateral dynamics of a vehicle. Even though the theoretical studies of the lateral control of autonomous vehicles are traditionally applied to lane keeping cases, the results can be applied to broader range of areas, such as lane changing cases.

How Would Surround Vehicles Move? A Unified Framework for Maneuver Classification and Motion Prediction,"Reliable prediction of surround vehicle motion is a critical requirement for path planning for autonomous vehicles. In this paper, we propose a unified framework for surround vehicle maneuver classification and motion prediction that exploits multiple cues, namely, the estimated motion of vehicles, an understanding of typical motion patterns of freeway traffic and intervehicle interaction. We report our results in terms of maneuver classification accuracy and mean and median absolute error of predicted trajectories against the ground truth for real traffic data collected using vehicle mounted sensors on freeways. An ablative analysis is performed to analyze the relative importance of each cue for trajectory prediction. Additionally, an analysis of execution time for the components of the framework is presented. Finally, we present multiple case studies analyzing the outputs of our model for complex traffic scenarios. © 2016 IEEE.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85081156923&doi=10.1109%2fTIV.2018.2804159&partnerID=40&md5=c12530109cd1e33676fae5e93bafb2fd,IEEE Transactions on Intelligent Vehicles,2018
Search-Based Motion Planning for Aggressive Flight in SE(3),"Quadrotors with large thrust-to-weight ratios are able to track aggressive trajectories with sharp turns and high accelerations. In this letter, we develop a search-based trajectory planning algorithm that exploits the quadrotor maneuverability to generate sequences of motion primitives in cluttered environments. We model the quadrotor body as an ellipsoid and compute its flight attitude along trajectories in order to check for collisions against obstacles. The ellipsoid model allows the quadrotor to pass through gaps that are smaller than its diameter with nonzero pitch or roll angles. Without any prior information about the location of gaps and associated attitude constraints, our algorithm is able to find a safe and optimal trajectory that guides the robot to its goal as fast as possible. To accelerate planning, we first perform a lower dimensional search and use it as a heuristic to guide the generation of a final dynamically feasible trajectory. We analyze critical discretization parameters of motion primitive planning and demonstrate the feasibility of the generated trajectories in various simulations and real-world experiments. © 2016 IEEE.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85060743563&doi=10.1109%2fLRA.2018.2795654&partnerID=40&md5=6c707be5ef1224f5ff670e42a4056f15,IEEE Robotics and Automation Letters,2018
Capacity Analysis of UAV Communications: Cases of Random Trajectories,"This paper analyzes the link capacity between autonomous unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) with random three-dimensional (3-D) trajectories. This is distinctively different from existing works typically under the assumption of either two-dimensional (2-D) or deterministic trajectories, and particularly interesting to applications such as surveillance and air combat. The key idea is that we geometrically derive the probability distributions of the UAV-to-UAV (U2U) distances which, by exploiting the Jensen's inequality, can be translated to the closed-form bounds for the capacity between UAVs, and between UAVs and ground stations. Another important aspect is that we extrapolate the idea to dense UAV networks, and analyze the impact of network densification, imperfect channel state information, and interference from ground transmitters on the capacity. Corroborated by simulations, our analysis shows that a U2U link with random 2-D trajectories is superior in terms of capacity due to its short average link distance. It is also revealed that a UAV-to-ground link can incur substantially lower capacity than a U2U link even in the case the 3-D coverage of the UAVs is the same, as the result of its longer average link length. © 1967-2012 IEEE.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85046002709&doi=10.1109%2fTVT.2018.2829726&partnerID=40&md5=4157f577b5c29308865df0e169bf63f3,IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology,2018
Optimal morphing – augmented dynamic soaring maneuvers for unmanned air vehicle capable of span and sweep morphologies,"This paper investigates autonomous dynamic soaring maneuvers for a small Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (sUAV) having the capability to morph. Dynamic soaring for UAVs have mostly been confined in literature to fixed configurations. In order to analyze the extent to which dynamic soaring is influenced by different morphologies, an innovative concept of integrating dynamic soaring with morphing capabilities is introduced. Moreover, optimal soaring trajectories are generated for two basic wing morphologies: variable sweep and variable span. Three-dimensional point-mass UAV equations of motion and nonlinear wind gradient profile are used to model the flight dynamics. Parametric characterization of the key performance parameters is performed to determine the optimal platform configuration during various phases of the maneuver. Results presented in this paper indicate 15% lesser required wind shear by the proposed span morphology and 14% lesser required wind shear by the proposed sweep morphology, in comparison to their respective fixed wing counterparts. This shows that the morphing UAV can perform dynamic soaring in an environment, where fixed configuration UAVs might not, because of lesser available wind shears. Apart from this, span morphology reduced drag by 15%, lift requirement by 11% and angle of attack requirement by 20%, whereas increased the maximum velocity by 6.2%, normalized energies by 9% and improved loitering parameters (approximately 10%), in comparison to fixed span configurations. Similarly, sweep morphology guaranteed 20% drag reduction, 16% lesser angle of attack requirement and improved loitering performance over the fixed sweep configurations. The results achieved from this study strongly support the idea of integrating dynamic soaring with morphing capabilities and its potential benefits. © 2018 Elsevier Masson SAS",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85047629498&doi=10.1016%2fj.ast.2018.05.024&partnerID=40&md5=c95fcdd42989bcbf3af03095326d4f52,Aerospace Science and Technology,2018
Analysis of Friendly Jamming for Secure Location Verification of Vehicles for Intelligent Highways,"In this paper, we present friendly jamming for secure location verification of vehicles in Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS). In friendly jamming confidential information is obscured from eavesdroppers through the use of opportunistic jamming on the part of the parties engaged in communication. Secure location verification enables the infrastructure in an ITS to verify the position claims of a vehicle in an adversarial setting. We present a method for effectively using friendly jamming and distance bounding together to verify the location and velocity of vehicles, and detect any deviation of claims by a 'prover' vehicle that is trying to prove its position and velocity to the infrastructure. The technique can be used to verify velocity and position claim of a vehicle, while keeping the feasible velocity and position lie by an attacker in a negligible range. Our analysis shows that in realistic traffic, friendly jamming is an improvement over comparable work, reducing position falsification by 86.66% to 92% for a typical attacker. The proposed technique also outperforms existing localization techniques for multiple colluding attackers, providing security against up to three colluding attackers, where colluders coordinate their movement and report information to help a single attacker achieve its goal. © 1967-2012 IEEE.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85047176198&doi=10.1109%2fTVT.2018.2839560&partnerID=40&md5=ab14462d7d03e5bb438c4265d89942e1,IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology,2018
Long Short-Term Memory Networks for Accurate State-of-Charge Estimation of Li-ion Batteries,"State of charge (SOC) estimation is critical to the safe and reliable operation of Li-ion battery packs, which nowadays are becoming increasingly used in electric vehicles (EVs), Hybrid EVs, unmanned aerial vehicles, and smart grid systems. We introduce a new method to perform accurate SOC estimation for Li-ion batteries using a recurrent neural network (RNN) with long short-term memory (LSTM). We showcase the LSTM-RNN's ability to encode dependencies in time and accurately estimate SOC without using any battery models, filters, or inference systems like Kalman filters. In addition, this machine-learning technique, like all others, is capable of generalizing the abstractions it learns during training to other datasets taken under different conditions. Therefore, we exploit this feature by training an LSTM-RNN model over datasets recorded at various ambient temperatures, leading to a single network that can properly estimate SOC at different ambient temperature conditions. The LSTM-RNN achieves a low mean absolute error (MAE) of 0.573% at a fixed ambient temperature and an MAE of 1.606% on a dataset with ambient temperature increasing from 10 to 25 °C. © 1982-2012 IEEE.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85040029828&doi=10.1109%2fTIE.2017.2787586&partnerID=40&md5=fd068f87249a14408b74a08c83c5b5f3,IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics,2018
Combating the Control Signal Spoofing Attack in UAV Systems,"Unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) system is vulnerable to the control signal spoofing attack due to the openness of the wireless communications. In this correspondence, a physical layer approach is proposed to combat the control signal spoofing attack, i.e., to determine whether the received control signal packet is from the ground control station or a potential malicious attacker (MA), which does not need to share any secret key. We consider the worst case where the UAV does not have any prior knowledge about the MA. Utilizing the channel feature of the angles of arrival, the distance-based path loss, and the Rician-κ factor, we construct a generalized log-likelihood radio test framework to handle the problem. Accurate approximations of the false alarm and successful detection rate are provided to efficiently evaluate the performance. © 1967-2012 IEEE.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85046369576&doi=10.1109%2fTVT.2018.2830345&partnerID=40&md5=eb085c4e31f66031daf6d452391a9007,IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology,2018
Robust and efficient relative pose with a Multi-Camera system for autonomous driving in highly dynamic environments,"This paper studies the relative pose problem for autonomous vehicles driving in highly dynamic and possibly cluttered environments. This is a challenging scenario due to the existence of multiple, large, and independently moving objects in the environment, which often leads to an excessive portion of outliers and results in erroneous motion estimation. Existing algorithms cannot cope with such situations well. This paper proposes a new algorithm for relative pose estimation using a multi-camera system with multiple non-overlapping cameras. The method works robustly even when the number of outliers is overwhelming. By exploiting specific prior knowledge of the autonomous driving scene, we have developed an efficient 4-point algorithm for multi-camera relative pose estimation, which admits analytic solutions by solving a polynomial root-finding equation, and runs extremely fast (at about 0.5 μs per root). When the solver is used in combination with a new random sample consensus sampling scheme by exploiting the conjugate motion constraint, we are able to quickly prune unpromising hypotheses and significantly improve the chance of finding inliers. Experiments on synthetic data have validated the performance of the proposed algorithm. Tests on real data further confirm the method's practical relevance. © 2000-2011 IEEE.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85030755266&doi=10.1109%2fTITS.2017.2749409&partnerID=40&md5=e41bea5b5f506f3674f296c9e8296c7d,IEEE Transactions on Intelligent Transportation Systems,2018
Robust Distributed Predictive Control of Waterborne AGVs - A Cooperative and Cost-Effective Approach,"Waterborne autonomous guided vessels (waterborne AGVs) moving over open waters experience environmental uncertainties. This paper proposes a novel cost-effective robust distributed control approach for waterborne AGVs. The overall system is uncertain and has independent subsystem dynamics but coupling objectives and state constraints. Waterborne AGVs determine their actions in a parallel way, while still minimizing an overall cost function and respecting coupling constraints robustly by communicating within a neighborhood. Our first contribution is the proposal of the system robustness level for the cost-effective robust distributed model predictive control (RDMPC) for waterborne AGVs. Cost-effective RDMPC models the price of robustness by explicitly considering uncertainty and system characteristics in a tube-based robust control framework. The second contribution is an efficient integrated branch bound (BB) and the alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMMs) algorithm for solving the cost-effective RDMPC problem. The algorithm exploits special ordered variable sets and combining branching criteria with intermediate ADMM results conducting smart search in BB.

Compressed Sensing of Underwater Acoustic Signals via Structured Approximation l0-Norm,"The underwater wireless sensor networks enable the telemonitoring and communications technologies of underwater information play important roles in the gathering process of scientific data in collaborative monitoring missions. However, to design such a system, several aspects must be considered to make fewer resources required, such as energy efficiency, miniaturization, the required functionality, etc. Conventional methods of data compression and reconstruction fail in energy efficiency. Different from the conventional compression methods, compressive sampling (CS) provides a new perspective to compress huge data with low energy consumption. Unfortunately, the recordings of underwater acoustic signal (UAS) are nonsparse in time domain. Hence, the current CS methods cannot be used directly for compression and reconstruction of UAS. This study adopts the wavelet-Transform-based dictionary matrix to build a framework for sparse representation; then, introduces an approach based on structured approximation $l-0$ (SAL0) norm, which is designed by exploring and exploiting the correlation structure of UAS. The proposed method searches the optimal sparse solution via steepest descent method and then projects the solution to its feasible set. Combing with the compression matrix and dictionary matrix, the estimation of SAL0 method is used for reconstructing nonsparse UAS.

A Hierarchical Detection and Response System to Enhance Security Against Lethal Cyber-Attacks in UAV Networks,"Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) networks have not yet received considerable research attention. Specifically, security issues are a major concern because such networks, which carry vital information, are prone to various attacks. In this paper, we design and implement a novel intrusion detection and response scheme, which operates at the UAV and ground station levels, to detect malicious anomalies that threaten the network. In this scheme, a set of detection and response techniques are proposed to monitor the UAV behaviors and categorize them into the appropriate list (normal, abnormal, suspect, and malicious) according to the detected cyber-attack. We focus on the most lethal cyber-attacks that can target an UAV network, namely, false information dissemination, GPS spoofing, jamming, and black hole and gray hole attacks. Extensive simulations confirm that the proposed scheme performs well in terms of attack detection even with a large number of UAVs and attackers since it exhibits a high detection rate, a low number of false positives, and prompt detection with a low communication overhead. © 2013 IEEE.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85051789644&doi=10.1109%2fTSMC.2017.2681698&partnerID=40&md5=14a4c35017f22271282d55e618f9cf53,"IEEE Transactions on Systems, Man, and Cybernetics: Systems",2018
IEEE 802.11p and visible light hybrid communication based secure autonomous platoon,"Autonomous vehicle platoon is an enhancement of autonomous behavior, where vehicles are organized into groups of close proximity through wireless communication. Platoon members mostly communicate with each other via the current dominant vehicular radio frequency (RF) technology, IEEE 802.11p. However, this technology leads security vulnerabilities under various attacks from adversaries. Visible light communication (VLC) has the potential to alleviate these vulnerabilities by exploiting the directivity and impermeability of light. Utilizing only VLC in vehicle platoon, on the other hand, may degrade platoon stability since VLC is sensitive to environmental effects. In this paper, we propose an IEEE 802.11p and VLC-based hybrid security protocol for platoon communication, namely SP-VLC, with the goal of ensuring platoon stability and securing platoon maneuvers under data packet injection, channel overhearing, jamming, and platoon maneuver attacks. We define platoon maneuver attack based on the identification of various scenarios where a fake maneuver packet is transmitted by a malicious actor. SP-VLC includes mechanisms for the secret key establishment, message authentication, data transmission over both IEEE 802.11p and VLC, jamming detection and reaction to switch to VLC only communication and secure platoon maneuvering based on the joint usage of IEEE 802.11p and VLC. We develop a simulation platform combining realistic vehicle mobility model, realistic VLC and IEEE 802.11p channel models, and vehicle platoon management. We show the functionality of the SP-VLC protocol under all possible security attacks by performing extensive simulations. Our findings demonstrate that SP-VLC protocol generates less than 0.1% difference in the speed of and distance between platoon members during security attacks in comparison to 25% and 10% in that of previously proposed IEEE 802.11p and IEEE 802.11p-VLC hybrid protocols, respectively. © 1967-2012 IEEE.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85047618950&doi=10.1109%2fTVT.2018.2840846&partnerID=40&md5=086802a8828ceaff8797d9b235ef7f41,IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology,2018
A Real-Time Battery Thermal Management Strategy for Connected and Automated Hybrid Electric Vehicles (CAHEVs) Based on Iterative Dynamic Programming,"Connected and automated hybrid electric vehicles (CAHEVs) are a potential solution to the future transportation due to their improved fuel economy, reduced emissions, and capability to mitigate congestion and improve safety. The battery thermal management (BTM) in CAHEVs is one of the crucial problems, because the lithium-ion batteries are highly temperature sensitive. Therefore, a practical and energy-efficient BTM strategy is required for both improving the operating temperature of batteries and saving energy. In this study, the dynamic programming (DP) is implemented for a BTM system in CAHEVs for achieving the optimal cooling/heating energy savings for batteries. To enhance the real-time capability, an iterative approach is proposed to approximate the optimum control strategy iteratively in a multidimensional search space. The proposed iterative DP strategy can improve the system performance and energy-efficiency by fully exploiting the future road information in CAHEVs combined with a model predictive control method. The hardware-in-the-loop validation of the proposed strategy is conducted on the UDDS and the WLTC drive cycles based on a Toyota Prius PHEV model. The results demonstrate the feasibility and effectiveness of the proposed BTM strategy that leads to a considerable BTM energy reduction. © 2018 IEEE.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85048176028&doi=10.1109%2fTVT.2018.2844368&partnerID=40&md5=d4f2190d93ed92ff9e296f802f83f607,IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology,2018
Robust trajectory and transmit power design for secure uav communications,"Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) are anticipated to be widely deployed in future wireless communications, due to their advantages of high mobility and easy deployment. However, the broadcast nature of air-To-ground line-of-sight wireless channels brings a new challenge to the information security of UAV-ground communication. This paper tackles such a challenge in the physical layer by exploiting the mobility of UAV via its trajectory design. We consider a UAV-ground communication system with multiple potential eavesdroppers on the ground, where the information on the locations of the eavesdroppers is imperfect. We formulate an optimization problem, which maximizes the average worst case secrecy rate of the system by jointly designing the robust trajectory and transmit power of the UAV over a given flight duration. The nonconvexity of the optimization problem and the imperfect location information of the eavesdroppers make the problem difficult to be solved optimally. We propose an iterative suboptimal algorithm to solve this problem efficiently by applying the block coordinate descent method, $\mathcal {S}$-procedure, and successive convex optimization method. Simulation results show that the proposed algorithm can improve the average worst case secrecy rate significantly, as compared to two other benchmark algorithms without robust design. © 1967-2012 IEEE.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85048900631&doi=10.1109%2fTVT.2018.2849644&partnerID=40&md5=63a2f6a821e885d3268da3a8a59973da,IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology,2018
A platoon based cooperative eco-driving model for mixed automated and human-driven vehicles at a signalised intersection,"The advancements in communication and sensing technologies can be exploited to assist the drivers in making better decisions. In this paper, we consider the design of a real-time cooperative eco-driving strategy for a group of vehicles with mixed automated vehicles (AVs) and human-driven vehicles (HVs). The lead vehicles in the platoon can receive the signal phase and timing information via vehicle-to-infrastructure (V2I) communication and the traffic states of both the preceding vehicle and current platoon via vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) communication. We propose a receding horizon model predictive control (MPC) method to minimise the fuel consumption for platoons and drive the platoons to pass the intersection on a green phase. The method is then extended to dynamic platoon splitting and merging rules for cooperation among AVs and HVs in response to the high variation in urban traffic flow. Extensive simulation tests are also conducted to demonstrate the performance of the model in various conditions in the mixed traffic flow and different penetration rates of AVs. Our model shows that the cooperation between AVs and HVs can further smooth out the trajectory of the latter and reduce the fuel consumption of the entire traffic system, especially for the low penetration of AVs. It is noteworthy that the proposed model does not compromise the traffic efficiency and the driving comfort while achieving the eco-driving strategy. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85049844305&doi=10.1016%2fj.trc.2018.05.025&partnerID=40&md5=8592ef90727064beade7c82b0d02a03d,Transportation Research Part C: Emerging Technologies,2018
Robust long-term registration of UAV images of crop fields for precision agriculture,"Continuous crop monitoring is an important aspect of precision agriculture and requires the registration of sensor data over longer periods of time. Often, fields are monitored using cameras mounted on unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) but strong changes in the visual appearance of the growing crops and the field itself poses serious challenges to conventional image registration methods. In this letter, we present a method for registering images of agricultural fields taken by an UAV over the crop season and present a complete pipeline for computing temporally aligned three-dimensional (3-D) point clouds of the field. Our approach exploits the inherent geometry of the crop arrangement in the field, which remains mostly static over time. This allows us to register the images even in the presence of strong visual changes. To this end, we propose a scale invariant, geometric feature descriptor that encodes the local plant arrangement geometry. The experiments suggest that we are able to register images taken over the crop season, including situations where matching with an off-the-shelf visual descriptor fails. We evaluate the accuracy of our matching system with respect to manually labeled ground truth. We furthermore illustrate that the reconstructed 3-D models are qualitatively correct and the registration results allow for monitoring growth parameters at a per plant level. © 2016 IEEE.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85063304907&doi=10.1109%2fLRA.2018.2849603&partnerID=40&md5=4d18064900d98631d26ee6b4e4f6f539,IEEE Robotics and Automation Letters,2018
A ROC-Based approach for developing optimal strategies in UUV search planning,"This paper addresses the high-level search planning that is necessary to find hidden objects in difficult undersea environments where sensor performance varies geographically and the susceptibility to false alarms is high. We develop a game-theoretic approach for maximizing the information that is collected as a multiagent collaborative search is conducted over a region of interest. To accomplish this, we apply 1) a search channel formalism to the discrete search modeling paradigm to develop information measures as a function of searcher regional visitation; and 2) a receiver operator characteristic analysis to map sensor detection characteristics to search events. We formulate an area search game where player action directs where and how information is collected under a fixed cost constraint on search effort. We discuss the properties of the information measure developed for a repeated look over the area search channel and examine the impact of setting ROC operating points to their game equilibrium values. We describe a new algorithmic capability for solving the search allocation problem where searchers can collaborate in their efforts to resolve false alarm outcomes. Results are presented to show the dominance of this approach over alternative strategies allotted to the game and to demonstrate the capability of exploiting the known nonhomogeneity in the search environment. © 2018 IEEE.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85031781253&doi=10.1109%2fJOE.2017.2752078&partnerID=40&md5=7241520fd3e989f6e258886ee375de8e,IEEE Journal of Oceanic Engineering,2018
Learning to Detect Aircraft for Long-Range Vision-Based Sense-and-Avoid Systems,"The commercial use of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) would be enhanced by an ability to sense and avoid potential mid-air collision threats. In this letter, we propose a new approach to aircraft detection for long-range vision-based sense and avoid. We first train a deep convolutional neural network to learn aircraft visual features using flight data of mid-air head-on near-collision course encounters between two fixed-wing aircraft. We then propose an approach that fuses these learnt aircraft features with hand-crafted features that are used by the current state of the art. Finally, we evaluate the performance of our proposed approach on real flight data captured from a UAV, where it achieves a mean detection range of 2527 m and a mean detection range improvement of 299 m (or 13.4%) compared to the current state of the art with no additional false alarms. © 2018 IEEE.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85063304769&doi=10.1109%2fLRA.2018.2867237&partnerID=40&md5=d829f5e51696cf590e7521b244fe1aaf,IEEE Robotics and Automation Letters,2018
Drone Pilot Identification by Classifying Radio-Control Signals,"Analysis of interactions with remotely controlled devices has been used to detect the onset of hijacking attacks, as well as for forensics analysis, e.g., to identify the human controller. Its effectiveness is known to depend on the remote device type as well as on the properties of the remote control signal. This paper shows that the radio control signal sent to an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) using a typical transmitter can be captured and analyzed to identify the controlling pilot using machine learning techniques. Twenty trained pilots have been asked to fly a high-end research drone through three different trajectories. Control data have been collected and used to train multiple classifiers. Best performance has been achieved by a random forest classifier that achieved accuracy around 90% using simple time-domain features. Extensive tests have shown that the classification accuracy depends on the flight trajectory and that the pitch, roll, yaw, and thrust control signals show different levels of significance for pilot identification. This result paves the way to a number of security and forensics applications, including continuous identification of UAV pilots to mitigate the risk of hijacking. © 2018 IEEE.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85044355155&doi=10.1109%2fTIFS.2018.2819126&partnerID=40&md5=2fc8b546a744c64be8a09e0c8e3ee1aa,IEEE Transactions on Information Forensics and Security,2018
Fast genetic algorithm path planner for fixed-wing military UAV Using GPU,"Military unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) are employed in highly dynamic environments and must often adjust their trajectories based on the evolving situation. To operate autonomously and safely, a UAV must be equipped with a path planning module capable of quickly recalculating a feasible and quasi-optimal path in flight while in the event a new obstacle or threat has been detected or simply if the destination point is changed during the mission. To allow for a fast path planning, this paper proposes a parallel implementation of the genetic algorithm on graphics processing unit (GPU). The trajectories are built as series of line segments connected by circular arcs resulting in smooth paths suitable for fixed-wing UAVs. The fitness function we defined takes into account the dynamic constraints of the UAVs and aims to minimize fuel consumption and average flying altitude in order to improve range and avoid detection by enemy radars. This fitness function is also implemented on the GPU and different parallelization strategies were developed and tested for each step of the fitness evaluation. By exploiting the massively parallel architecture of GPUs, the execution time of the proposed path planner was reduced by a factor of 290x compared to a sequential execution on CPU. The path planning module developed was tested using 18 scenarios on six realistic three-dimensional terrains with multiple no-fly zones. We found that the proposed GPU-based path planner was able to find quasi-optimal solutions in a timely fashion allowing in-flight planning. © 1965-2011 IEEE.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85042201341&doi=10.1109%2fTAES.2018.2807558&partnerID=40&md5=83cbe80b5c402b9abeda7c410b98c0c0,IEEE Transactions on Aerospace and Electronic Systems,2018
Secure automated valet parking: A privacy-preserving reservation scheme for autonomous vehicles,"It is believed that automated valet parking (AVP) system has great potential to mitigate the parking headache for the future smart city, as it can provide on-demand parking services, bringing immense benefits from energy saving for vehicles to time saving for drivers. For an AVP system, parking reservation is an indispensable part so that vehicles can accomplish automated parking in accordance with the reserved parking information. However, the reservation requests may not only reveal the driver identity, but also disclose his/her sensitive locations, e.g., the most visited places, which are of great concerns to users. To deal with this challenge, the anonymous techniques can be naturally applied during parking reservation, but directly applying the anonymous techniques in AVP will introduce a new security issue, i.e., the anonymous user may maliciously crash the AVP system by repetitively sending the reservation requests, which is called 'double-reservation attack.' In this paper, we propose a new privacy-preserving reservation scheme for securing AVP system. Specifically, each anonymous user must have only one valid reservation token at any moment, and the token can only be used for booking one vacant parking space once. The proposed scheme does not only preserve the user's identity privacy and location privacy but also prevents the 'double-reservation attack' based on several elegant building blocks, i.e., zero-knowledge proofs of knowledge and proxy resignature. Detailed security analysis confirms the security properties of our proposed scheme. In addition, extensive simulations are conducted to compare our proposed scheme with three previous schemes, and the experiment results demonstrate that our scheme is also much efficient in a WiFi-based testbed. © 2018 IEEE.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85053353343&doi=10.1109%2fTVT.2018.2870167&partnerID=40&md5=a4cb081803e72cf184671aac3dbee16e,IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology,2018
Spline-based motion planning for autonomous guided vehicles in a dynamic environment,"Autonomous vehicles require a collision-free motion trajectory at every time instant. This brief presents an optimization-based method to calculate such trajectories for autonomous vehicles operating in an uncertain environment with moving obstacles. The proposed approach applies to linear system models, as well as to a particular class of nonlinear models, including industrially relevant vehicles, such as autonomous guided vehicles with front wheel, differential wheel, and rear-wheel steering. The method computes smooth motion trajectories, satisfying the vehicle's kinematics, by using a spline parameterization. Furthermore, it exploits spline properties to keep the resulting nonlinear optimization problem small scale and to guarantee constraint satisfaction, without the need for time gridding. The resulting problem is solved sufficiently fast for online motion planning, dealing with uncertainties and changes in the environment. This brief demonstrates the potential of the method with extensive numerical simulations. In addition, it presents an experimental validation in which a KUKA youBot, steered as a holonomic or differential drive vehicle, drives through an environment with moving obstacles. To facilitate the further development and the numerical and experimental validation of the presented method, it is embodied in a user-friendly open-source software toolbox. © 1993-2012 IEEE.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85028722736&doi=10.1109%2fTCST.2017.2739706&partnerID=40&md5=483b645597e706cab6f5c8dc967cce74,IEEE Transactions on Control Systems Technology,2018
A unified framework for exploiting color coefficients for salient object detection,"With many applications in high level scene understanding, salient object detection is an important objective. In addition, this topic has received significant attention recently. This work proposes techniques that exploit the role of color spaces for addressing two important challenges in relation to salient object detection. The autonomous identification of a color space by which to carry out the processing has always been of prime importance to most image analysis tasks and this is equally so in relation to saliency detection. To address this challenge, a new adaptive color space selection method is proposed, here, which autonomously identifies the color space that is locally the most appropriate for saliency detection on an image by image basis. The color channels within this identified local color space are aggregated using joint l2, 1-norm minimization in order to determine feature importance and also to achieve feature selection leaning. A process relevant to saliency detection is multi-modality feature fusion, in which multiple features and color spaces are used in combination to capture the saliency aspects of an image/region. To implement this second process, a new technique for the region based optimal combination of feature modalities is introduced. The results of the rigorous experimental evaluations demonstrate the effectiveness of the adaptive color space selection and also for the region based optimal combination methods in comparison to 13 other state-of-the-art saliency methods and all in relation to three benchmark datasets. The efficacy of the proposed color space selection and region based combination methods is further validated by examining their ability to select appropriate color spaces for, and successfully aggregate the results of, up to five benchmark methods. © 2018",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85048331149&doi=10.1016%2fj.neucom.2018.05.091&partnerID=40&md5=e89e97fd411c8bfb71b6bfb0f2e82e46,Neurocomputing,2018
ArchCam: Real time expert system for suspicious behaviour detection in ATM site,"Automated Teller Machine (ATM) offers great convenience to many people by allowing quick bank transactions and cash withdrawal. However, ATM machines are also vulnerable to attacks when they are unattended during non-office hours and public holidays. Recently, many ATM machines were reported being removed from the premises or damaged using various methods in order to steal the cash inside. Due to this reason, many ATM sites are actually equipped with video surveillance systems to monitor the environment for crime prevention. However, it is difficult for security personnel to pin-point the crime scene in real time when the number of surveillance cameras increases. In this paper, a real time security expert video surveillance system was proposed to detect the suspicious behaviour by utilizing image processing techniques. The proposed expert system, hereafter referred to as ArchCam, is capable in detecting suspicious behaviours that attempt to remove or attack the ATM machines and provide early warning to the centralized video surveillance system. The suspicious behaviour that ArchCam detects include squatting/climbing (attempt to remove security alarm system or place a bomb) and carrying “belt shape” object (attempt to remove the ATM). The squatting/climbing activity is detected through novel technique to estimate the height of the moving object(s) in front of ATM. On the other hand, the “belt shape” object is detected through estimation of object width by using region splitting and merging technique. With the intelligence of detecting suspicious behaviour, the proposed expert system can effectively alert the security personnel to take proactive actions before the cash is being robbed from the ATM machines. This greatly reduces the effort for security personnel as they only need to observe the camera videos with suspicious behaviour, which on the other hand help to improve the possibility of detecting actual crime scene in real time. ArchCam was implemented in an embedded system with GPU platform and has been verified in a simulated ATM setup with good detection accuracy and fast computational timing performance. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85047425451&doi=10.1016%2fj.eswa.2018.05.014&partnerID=40&md5=434a2a0ce6b20f9c5c2f565136e14afe,Expert Systems with Applications,2018
A Comparison of Stateless Position-based Packet Routing Algorithms for FANETs,"Scalable routing for wireless communication systems is a compelling and challenging task. To this aim, routing algorithms exploiting geographic information have been proposed. These algorithms refer to nodes by their location, rather than their address, and use those coordinates to route greedily towards a destination. With the advent of unmanned airborne vehicle (UAV) technology, a lot of research effort has been devoted to extend position-based packet routing proposals to three dimensional environments. In this context, Flying Ad-hoc Networks (FANETs), comprised of autonomous flying vehicles, pose several issues. This work focuses on the state-of-the-art, stateless geographic packet routing protocols conceived or adapted for three-dimensional network scenarios. Proposals are evaluated over a common scenario through a comprehensive comparative analysis. © 2002-2012 IEEE.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85042847892&doi=10.1109%2fTMC.2018.2811490&partnerID=40&md5=3ada469362f1ad72e6320119c28ad14a,IEEE Transactions on Mobile Computing,2018
Decomposition of Reachable Sets and Tubes for a Class of Nonlinear Systems,"Reachability analysis provides formal guarantees for performance and safety properties of nonlinear control systems. Here, one aims to compute the backward reachable set (BRS) or tube (BRT) - the set of states from which the system can be driven into a target set at a particular time or within a time interval, respectively. The computational complexity of current approaches scales poorly, making application to high-dimensional systems intractable. We propose a technique that decomposes the dynamics of a general class of nonlinear systems into subsystems which may be coupled through common states, controls, and disturbances. Despite this coupling, BRSs and BRTs can be computed efficiently using our technique without incurring additional approximation errors and without the need for linearizing dynamics or approximating sets as polytopes. Computations of BRSs and BRTs now become orders of magnitude faster, and for the first time BRSs and BRTs for many high-dimensional nonlinear control systems can be computed using the Hamilton-Jacobi formulation. In situations involving bounded adversarial disturbances, our proposed method can obtain slightly conservative results. We demonstrate our theory by numerically computing BRSs and BRTs for several systems, including the six-dimensional Acrobatic Quadrotor using the HJ formulation. © 2018 IEEE.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85041005951&doi=10.1109%2fTAC.2018.2797194&partnerID=40&md5=3635a7d5b691b0137559d2d95638c7c9,IEEE Transactions on Automatic Control,2018
Automated-Sampling-Based Stability Verification and DOA Estimation for Nonlinear Systems,"This paper develops a new sampling-based method for stability verification of piecewise continuous nonlinear systems via Lyapunov functions. Depending on the nonlinear system dynamics, the candidate Lyapunov function and the set of states of interest, verifying stability requires solving complex, possibly non-convex or infeasible optimization problems. To avoid such problems, the proposed approach firstly distributes the verification of Lyapunov's inequality on a finite sampling of a bounded set of states of interest. Secondly, it extends the validity of Lyapunov's inequality to an infinite, bounded set of states by automatically exploiting local continuity properties. A sampling-based method for estimating the domain of attraction (DOA) via level sets of a validated Lyapunov function is also presented. Efficient state-space exploration is achieved using multi-resolution sampling and hyper-rectangles as basic sampling blocks. The operations that need to be performed for each sampling point in the state-space can be carried out in parallel, which improves scalability. The proposed methodology is illustrated for various benchmark examples from the literature. © 2018 IEEE.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85040966101&doi=10.1109%2fTAC.2018.2797196&partnerID=40&md5=77704dba5a33fcf38e7f23d81d86729b,IEEE Transactions on Automatic Control,2018
Consensus ensemble system for traffic flow prediction,"Traffic flow prediction is a key component of an intelligent transportation system. Accurate traffic flow prediction provides a foundation for other tasks, such as signal coordination and travel time forecasting. There are many known methods in literature for the short-term traffic flow prediction problem, but their efficacy depends heavily on the traffic characteristics. It is difficult, if not impossible, to pick a single method that works well over time. In this paper, we present an automated framework to address this practical issue. Instead of selecting a single method, we combine predictions from multiple methods to generate a consensus traffic flow prediction. We propose an ensemble learning model that exploits the temporal characteristics of the data, and balances the accuracy of individual models and their mutual dependence through a covariance-regularizer. We additionally use a pruning scheme to remove anomalous individual predictions. We apply our proposed model to multi-step-ahead arterial roadway flow prediction. In tests, our method consistently outperforms recently published ensemble prediction methods based on ridge regression and lasso. Our method also produces steady results even when the standalone models and other ensemble methods make wildly exaggerated predictions. © 2000-2011 IEEE.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85042871146&doi=10.1109%2fTITS.2018.2791505&partnerID=40&md5=ae516d16430f026daaab7058723ca4bf,IEEE Transactions on Intelligent Transportation Systems,2018
Multiantenna GNSS and Inertial Sensors/Odometer Coupling for Robust Vehicular Navigation,"Location information is one of the most vital information required to achieve intelligence and context-awareness for Internet of Things applications such as driverless cars. However, related security and privacy threats are a major holdback. With increasing focus on the use global navigation satellite system (GNSS) for autonomous navigation and related applications, it is important to provide robust navigation solutions. Radio frequency interference, either intentional or unintentional, has a direct impact on GNSS navigation performance related to observability and accuracy. In terms of security, spoofing is the major issue of concern. This paper focuses on multiantenna GNSS and inertial navigation system (INS)-odometer integration to improve robustness, security, and privacy of navigation solutions. Multiantenna GNSS provides robustness against different interference sources and integration with INS provides continuous navigation solutions during short-term signal outages.

Analyzing and Enhancing the Security of Ultrasonic Sensors for Autonomous Vehicles,"Autonomous vehicles rely on sensors to measure road condition and make driving decisions, and their safety relies heavily on the reliability of these sensors. Out of all obstacle detection sensors, ultrasonic sensors have the largest market share and are expected to be increasingly installed on automobiles. Such sensors discover obstacles by emitting ultrasounds and analyzing their reflections. By exploiting the built-in vulnerabilities of sensors, we designed random spoofing, adaptive spoofing, and jamming attacks on ultrasonic sensors, and we managed to trick a vehicle to stop when it should keep moving, and let it fail to stop when it should. We validate our attacks on stand-alone sensors and moving vehicles, including a Tesla Model S with the 'Autopilot' system. The results show that the attacks cause blindness and malfunction of not only sensors but also autonomous vehicles, which can lead to collisions. To enhance the security of ultrasonic sensors and autonomous vehicles, we propose two defense strategies, single-sensor-based physical shift authentication that verifies signals on the physical level, and multiple sensor consistency check that employs multiple sensors to verify signals on the system level. Our experiments on real sensors and MATLAB simulation reveal the validity of both schemes. © 2014 IEEE.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85052658029&doi=10.1109%2fJIOT.2018.2867917&partnerID=40&md5=c396c7f61035fdf4aae64a87dc4ece00,IEEE Internet of Things Journal,2018
"Development of a simulation platform for safety impact analysis considering vehicle dynamics, sensor errors, and communication latencies: Assessing cooperative adaptive cruise control under cyber attack","While safety is one of the most critical contributions of Cooperative Adaptive Cruise Control (CACC), it is impractical to assess such impacts in a real world. Even with simulation, many factors including vehicle dynamics, sensor errors, automated vehicle control algorithms and crash severity need to be properly modeled. In this paper, a simulation platform is proposed which explicitly features: (i) vehicle dynamics; (ii) sensor errors and communication delays; (iii) compatibility with CACC controllers; (iv) state-of-the-art predecessor leader following (PLF) based cooperative adaptive cruise control (CACC) controller; and (v) ability to quantify crash severity and CACC stability. The proposed simulation platform evaluated the CACC performance under normal and cybersecurity attack scenarios using speed variation, headway ratio, and injury probability. The first two measures of effectiveness (MOEs) represent the stability of CACC platoon while the injury probability quantifies the severity of a crash. The proposed platform can evaluate the safety performance of CACC controllers of interest under various paroxysmal or extreme events. It is particularly useful when traditional empirical driver models are not applicable. Such situations include, but are not limited to, cyber-attacks, sensor failures, and heterogeneous traffic conditions. The proposed platform is validated against data collected from real field tests and tested under various cyber-attack scenarios. © 2018",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85054924551&doi=10.1016%2fj.trc.2018.10.005&partnerID=40&md5=b5b97407dfff322045cc0896396358be,Transportation Research Part C: Emerging Technologies,2018

Convolutional neural networks for analyzing unmanned aerial vehicles sound,"The emergence of Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAV) is pervasive throughout society. A growing segment of usage is of a dubious nature for harassment, illegal activity and terrorism. Detection of unknown UAV’s has become a requirement for many organizations and agencies to thwart the emergence of UAV’s that are in some way threatening. To detect UAV, the use of acoustic signals has become an useful area of research. Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) are one of several models of deep learning, applied in various fields such as image recognition and natural language processing. In this project, we design a system to detect the presence of possible detection and payload detection using CNNs on the basis of sound data generated from UAV flights.

An approach for reducing computational time for real-time autonomous vehicle tracking,"Autonomous vehicles are familiar to public in daily life nowadays. For a recreational purpose, autonomous vehicles such as drones are commonly adopted for people. However with the easy accessibility, those autonomous vehicles can be a threat to anyone. Moreover, to detect and prevent those possible threats, real-time detection and tracking system is required. With the requirements, we propose a real-time communication between post-processing device and autonomous vehicle tracking sensor, which is a radar and a noise reduction method for post-processing. With the proposed method, a Frequency Modulated Continuous Wave (FMCW) radar can be utilized for real-time monitoring of autonomous vehicle. In this paper, we used an audio file recorded through a FMCW radar for distance tracking. The recorded audio data were processed by Inverse Fast Fourier Transformation (IFFT) and noise cancellation. We propose a data selection formula for faster IFFT processing and a noise reduction method in real-time communication.

Robust path following controller for unmanned aerial vehicle based on carrot chasing guidance law using dynamic inversion,"This paper focuses on autonomous path-following flight under uncertainty and external disturbances. Integrated UAV waypoints guidance scheme based on carrot chasing guidance law is presented. In order to follow a desired path a Virtual Track Point (VTP) is introduced on the path and make the UAV chase it. The UAV updates its heading direction toward the VTP. As time progresses, the UAV will move toward the path and asymptotically follow the path. Nonlinear Dynamic Inversion (NDI) awards the flight control system researchers a straight forward method of deriving control laws for nonlinear systems. The control inputs are used to cancel unwanted terms in the equations of motion using negative feedback of these terms. The two-timescale assumption that separates the fast dynamics which are the three angular rates of the aircraft from the slow dynamics which include the angle of attack, side-slip angle, and bank angle is adopted. NDI control law is designed for the fast variables using the deflection of aerodynamic control surfaces as inputs. Next, NDI is applied to the control of the slow states using the outputs of the fast loop as inputs. Simulation results for the nonlinear flight control system are given to illustrate the effectiveness of the technique. The validation of the designed flight system controller is demonstrated through real flight test. © ICROS.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85060474647&partnerID=40&md5=ba6b4fe217b06e7886573e2f6dcf24ba,"International Conference on Control, Automation and Systems",2018
Recovering and Simulating Pedestrians in the Wild,"Sensor simulation is a key component for testing the performance of self-driving vehicles and for data augmentation to better train perception systems. Typical approaches rely on artists to create both 3D assets and their animations to generate a new scenario. This, however, does not scale. In contrast, we propose to recover the shape and motion of pedestrians from sensor readings captured in the wild by a self-driving car driving around. Towards this goal, we formulate the problem as energy minimization in a deep structured model that exploits human shape priors, reprojection consistency with 2D poses extracted from images, and a ray-caster that encourages the reconstructed mesh to agree with the LiDAR readings. Importantly, we do not require any ground-truth 3D scans or 3D pose annotations. We then incorporate the reconstructed pedestrian assets bank in a realistic LiDAR simulation system by performing motion retargeting, and show that the simulated LiDAR data can be used to significantly reduce the amount of annotated real-world data required for visual perception tasks. © 2020 Proceedings of Machine Learning Research.

Deep-VFog: When Artificial Intelligence Meets Fog Computing in V2X,"Next-generation vehicle-to-everything (V2X) networks are envisioned as communication platforms, which not only aim to improve road safety and drastically increase traffic efficiency but also introduce a plethora of innovative applications that mostly require ultrareliable low-latency communications. Motivated by such new applications and its accompanying services, future vehicular networks can easily switch from current connected vehicles, mostly vehicle-to-vehicle, to fully heterogeneous V2X networks that support autonomous driving. Toward this target, the deep integration between artificial intelligence (AI) and fog computing (FC) technologies within the future V2X networks is a step whose time has come. In this survey, we address a novel and practical AI-enabled vehicular network architecture with FC in its core. Moreover, we present AI-enabled, fog-assisted V2X use cases that accommodate important FC capabilities and exploit the power of AI for enabling the desired evolution of vehicular networks. Finally, some potential issues of AI in FC-based V2X networks for future work are discussed. © 2020 IEEE.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85113088693&doi=10.1109%2fJSYST.2020.3009998&partnerID=40&md5=f66bab551d4db2db99af2e2fc38eae39,IEEE Systems Journal,2020
Learning to Communicate and Correct Pose Errors,"Learned communication makes multi-agent systems more effective by aggregating distributed information. However, it also exposes individual agents to the threat of erroneous messages they might receive. In this paper, we study the setting proposed in V2VNet [1], where nearby self-driving vehicles jointly perform object detection and motion forecasting in a cooperative manner. Despite a huge performance boost when the agents solve the task together, the gain is quickly diminished in the presence of pose noise since the communication relies on spatial transformations. Hence, we propose a novel neural reasoning framework that learns to communicate, to estimate potential errors, and finally, to reach a consensus about those errors. Experiments confirm that our proposed framework significantly improves the robustness of multi-agent self-driving perception and motion forecasting systems under realistic and severe localization noise. © 2020 Proceedings of Machine Learning Research.

Deep Learning Applied to Chest X-Rays: Exploiting and Preventing Shortcuts,"While deep learning has shown promise in improving the automated diagnosis of disease based on chest X-rays, deep networks may exhibit undesirable behavior related to shortcuts. This paper studies the case of spurious class skew in which patients with a particular attribute are spuriously more likely to have the outcome of interest. For instance, clinical protocols might lead to a dataset in which patients with pacemakers are disproportionately likely to have congestive heart failure. This skew can lead to models that take shortcuts by heavily relying on the biased attribute. We explore this problem across a number of attributes in the context of diagnosing the cause of acute hypoxemic respiratory failure. Applied to chest X-rays, we show that i) deep nets can accurately identify many patient attributes including sex (AUROC = 0.96) and age (AUROC ≥ 0.90), ii) they tend to exploit correlations between such attributes and the outcome label when learning to predict a diagnosis, leading to poor performance when such correlations do not hold in the test population (e.g., everyone in the test set is male), and iii) a simple transfer learning approach is surprisingly effective at preventing the shortcut and promoting good generalization performance. On the task of diagnosing congestive heart failure based on a set of chest X-rays skewed towards older patients (age ≥ 63), the proposed approach improves generalization over standard training from 0.66 (95% CI: 0.54-0.77) to 0.84 (95% CI: 0.73-0.92) AUROC. While simple, the proposed approach has the potential to improve the performance of models across populations by encouraging reliance on clinically relevant manifestations of disease, i.e., those that a clinician would use to make a diagnosis. © 2020 S.

Anomaly Detection for Controller Area Networks Using Long Short-Term Memory,"The rapid expansion of intra-vehicle networks has increased the number of threats to such networks. Most modern vehicles implement various physical and data-link layer technologies. Vehicles are becoming increasingly autonomous and connected. Controller Area Network (CAN) is one such serial bus system that is used to connect sensors and controllers (Electronic Control Units - ECUs) within a vehicle. ECUs vary widely in processing power, storage, memory, and connectivity. Classical cryptographic approaches are resource intensive. There is a need for efficient security countermeasures for protecting the CAN from various attacks. In this article, we present a novel Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) network to detect anomalies. Once trained, our system is capable of detecting anomalies in real-time and uses minimal resources. We report the results of our novel prediction algorithm that we use to select optimal LSTM network parameters. Our prediction algorithm and anomaly detection engine have been tested on data from real automobiles. We present the results of our experiments and analyze our findings.  © 2020 IEEE.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85118253251&doi=10.1109%2fOJITS.2020.3043066&partnerID=40&md5=b943d5e65fec7c0b229c5653f2d6e219,IEEE Open Journal of Intelligent Transportation Systems,2020
Learning and Uncertainty-Exploited Directional Antenna Control for Robust Long-Distance and Broad-Band Aerial Communication,"Aerial communication using directional antennas (ACDA) is a promising solution to enable long-distance and broad-band unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV)-to-UAV networking. The automatic alignment of directional antennas allows the transmission energy to focus in certain direction and significantly extends the communication range and rejects interference. Robust automatic alignment of directional antennas is not easy to achieve, considering practical issues such as the limited on-board sensing devices due to the physical constraints of UAV payload and power supplies, uncertain and varying UAV movement patterns, and unstable GPS and unknown communication environments. In this paper, we develop reinforcement learning (RL)-based online antenna control solutions for the ACDA system to conquer these challenges. The control solution adopts an uncertain UAV mobility modeling and intention estimation framework to capture and predict the uncertain intentions of UAV maneuvers and hence permit robust tracking. To account for an unstable GPS environment, the control solution features a learning of communication channel models to provide additional measurement signals in GPS-denied settings. A novel stochastic optimal control solution for nonlinear random switching dynamics is developed that integrates RL, an effective uncertainty evaluation method called multivariate probabilistic collocation method (MPCM), and unscented Kalman Filter (UKF). Simulation studies are conducted to illustrate and validate the proposed solutions. © 1967-2012 IEEE.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85078433026&doi=10.1109%2fTVT.2019.2951721&partnerID=40&md5=ca44141e36aa94717c5962c9f688f566,IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology,2020
State-Aware Rate Adaptation for UAVs by Incorporating On-Board Sensors,"Nowadays unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) are being widely applied to a wealth of civil and military applications. Robust and high-throughput wireless communication is the crux of these UAV applications. Yet, air-to-ground links suffer from time-varying channels induced by the agile mobility and dynamic environments. Rate adaptation algorithms are generally used to choose the optimal data rate based on the current channel conditions. State-of-the-art approaches leverage physical layer information for rate adaptation, and they work well under certain conditions. However, the above protocols still have limitation under constantly changing flight states and environments for air-to-ground links. To solve this problem, we propose StateRate, a state-optimized rate adaptation algorithm that fully exploits the characteristics of UAV systems using a hybrid deep learning model. The key observation is that the rate adaptation strategy needs to be adjusted according to motion-dependent channel models, which can be reflected by flight states. In this work, the rate adaptation protocol is enhanced with the help of the on-board sensors in UAVs. To make full use of the sensor data, we introduce a learning-based prediction module by leveraging the internal state and an online learning algorithm by employing the pre-trained model that adapts the rate adaptation algorithm to different environments. We implement our algorithm on a commercial UAV platform and evaluate it in various environments. The results demonstrate that our system outperforms the best-known rate adaptation algorithm up to 53% in terms of throughput when the velocity is 2-6 m/s. © 1967-2012 IEEE.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85078543923&doi=10.1109%2fTVT.2019.2950285&partnerID=40&md5=154715478973f2622ad48d91b47e869d,IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology,2020
Self-Energized UAV-Assisted scheme for cooperative wireless relay networks,"Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) have recently been envisaged as an enabling technology of 5G. UAVs act as an intermediate relay node to facilitate uninterrupted, high quality communication between information sources and their destination. However, UAV energy management has been a major issue of consideration due to limited power supply, affecting flight duration. Thus, we introduce in this paper a unified energy management framework by resorting to wireless power transfer (WPT), simultaneous wireless information and power transfer (SWIPT) and self-interference (SI) energy harvesting (EH) schemes, in cooperative relay communications. In our new technique, UAVs are deployed as relays equipped with a decode and forward protocol and EH capability operating in a full-duplex (FD) mode. The UAV assists information transmission between a terrestrial base station and a user. The UAV's transmission capability is powered exclusively by the energy harvested from WPT, radio frequency signal transmitted from the source via time-switching SWIPT protocol and SI exploitation. We improve the overall system throughput by the use of FD based UAV-assisted cooperative system. In this proposed system, we formulate two optimization problems to minimize end-to-end outage probability, subject to UAV's power profile and trajectory for a DF relay scheme, respectively. The KKT conditions have been used to obtain closed-form solutions for the two formulated problems. Numerical simulation results validate all the theoretical results. We demonstrate that the performance of our proposed unified EH scheme outperforms that of existing techniques in the literature. © 1967-2012 IEEE.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85078494730&doi=10.1109%2fTVT.2019.2950041&partnerID=40&md5=ee17de80ed85452ff584bc6e0d41514f,IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology,2020
"Cooperative Routing for an Air-Ground Vehicle Team - Exact Algorithm, Transformation Method, and Heuristics","This paper considers a cooperative vehicle routing problem for an intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance mission in the presence of communication constraints between the vehicles. The proposed framework uses a ground vehicle and an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) that travel cooperatively and visit a set of targets while satisfying the communication constraints. The problem is formulated as a mixed-integer linear program, and a branch-and-cut algorithm is developed to solve the problem to optimality. Furthermore, a transformation method and a heuristic are also developed for the problem. The effectiveness of all the algorithms is corroborated through extensive computational experiments on several randomly generated instances. Note to Practitioners - This paper is motivated by an intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance mission involving a single unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) and a ground vehicle, where the vehicles must coordinate their activity in the presence of communication constraints. The combination of a small UAV and a ground vehicle is an ideal platform for such missions, since small UAVs can fly at low altitudes and can avoid obstacles or threats that would be problematic for the ground vehicle alone. This paper addresses the coordinated routing problem involving these two vehicles and presents an algorithm to obtain an optimal solution for this problem, fast heuristics to obtain good feasible solutions, and also a transformation method to transform any instance of this cooperative vehicle routing problem to an instance of the one-in-a-set traveling salesman problem. © 2004-2012 IEEE.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85078311760&doi=10.1109%2fTASE.2019.2931894&partnerID=40&md5=a8e0ccdac32f04af720f3c3d9394d0df,IEEE Transactions on Automation Science and Engineering,2020
Densely pyramidal residual network for UAV-based railway images dehazing,"On purpose of aiding detection and recognition for railway infrastructure and dramatic changes in the environment around railways, visual inspection based on unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) images is a highlight. However, UAV images often suffer from degradation for fog or haze, which limits the inspection efficiency. Most existing methods depend on a suboptimal two-step network with much more redundant procedures where transmission map and atmospheric light are estimated at first, and then haze-free images can be acquired using a dehazing model. This paper presents a novel end-to-end network for UAV-based railway images dehazing, and focuses on two key issues: network architecture and loss function. With regards to the first aspect, based on a pyramidal network structure, densely pyramidal residual network (DPRnet) consists of dense residual block and enhanced residual blocks, which heavily exploits the feature maps of all preceding layers and considerably increased depth at different scale, respectively. With regards to the second, a new loss function introducing structural similarity index is proposed to preserve more structural information, thereby restore the appealing perceptual quality of the hazy images. Finally, quantitative and qualitative evaluations illustrate that the DPRnet achieves better performance over the classic methods, yet remains efficient and convenient. © 2019",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85072526063&doi=10.1016%2fj.neucom.2019.06.076&partnerID=40&md5=0d7e222d203d0ea01f083c493f2af160,Neurocomputing,2020
Is image-based CAPTCHA secure against attacks based on machine learning? An experimental study,"The completely automated public Turing test to tell computers and humans apart (CAPTCHA) is among the most common methods of authentication used by websites and web services. It is intended to protect online services from automated scripts and malicious programs. Text-based and audio CAPTCHA are two of the earliest such methods, and have been shown to be inadequate at protecting systems and services. Image-based CAPTCHA has been introduced to address the limitations of previous CAPTCHA methods. It uses image recognition tasks to determine whether the user is a human or a malicious program. In light of the sensitivity of protected resources, challenges to their security arising from advances in machine learning algorithms are investigated here. This study examines the strength of image-based CAPTCHA by proposing an image-based CAPTCHA breaking system. The proposed system can automatically answer challenges posed by the recently proposed Google image reCAPTCHA with minimal human intervention. It employs deep learning technologies and machine learning algorithms, including random forest, classification and regression trees (CART), bagging with CART, and Naïve Bayes to automatically answer challenges. The proposed attack mechanism achieved an average accuracy of 85.32% while successfully solving 56.29% of reCAPTCHA challenges posed to it. The results show current image-based CAPTCHAs to deter automated scripts and malicious programs provide a false sense of security. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85073538435&doi=10.1016%2fj.cose.2019.101635&partnerID=40&md5=be57ecfda18707092b262b8c12d5f9dc,Computers and Security,2020
Adaptive control for multi-rotor UAVs autonomous ship landing with mission planning,"The autonomous ship landing control issue of multi-rotor Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) is investigated. To achieve the ship landing operation efficiently and precisely, a novel mission planning consisting of an approaching stage and a landing stage is first proposed, where the desired altitude for the UAV is provided according to the requirements in each stage. Affected by rough sea wave, a feasible final landing condition is planned such that the UAV could land on the ship board in a safe environment. Then, the solution to the ship landing operation is transformed into the UAV trajectory tracking. Due to the under-actuated nature of the UAV, an adaptive robust hierarchical algorithm is developed such that the position tracking to the desired trajectory and the attitude tracking to the command attitude are achieved. In particular, an asymmetric saturated command force is designed by introducing a dynamic compensator to ensure the nonsingular attitude extraction, and a tracking error constrained applied torque is exploited to avoid the nature singularity of Euler angle in sequence. The asymptotic stability of the closed-loop system is analyzed in view of the hierarchical system stability theory. Simulations are performed to validate the proposed strategy. © 2019 Elsevier Masson SAS",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85076042269&doi=10.1016%2fj.ast.2019.105549&partnerID=40&md5=5219e287e80f36206a61cbdefa5a7e53,Aerospace Science and Technology,2020
Integrated Positioning for Connected Vehicles,"In the era of autonomous cars, accurate vehicular positioning becomes very essential. The global navigation satellite systems (GNSS) suffer from signal blockage and severe multipath in urban canyons, which degrades the positioning accuracy and availability. Therefore, vehicles solely relying on positioning from GNSS receivers have limited performance. In this research, we present a novel unified cooperative positioning solution which enhances positioning accuracy and availability in urban canyons. The proposed system exploits the fact that vehicles have different positioning resources and is based on angle approximation, which artificially generates the hindered pseudorange by sharing angle information between vehicles using dedicated short-range communication. In addition, we propose a system that employs the proposed cooperative technique to assist the loose integration between the inertial navigation system (INS) and the GPS system (using extended Kalman filter) during partial GPS outages. Using raw data from inertial sensors and GPS receivers in the real road trajectories, we implement the cooperative INS/GPS loose integration and show that our cooperative integrated system outperforms the non-cooperative integrated system. The performance metrics used are the 2-D positioning root-mean-square error, the maximum 2-D positioning error, and the positioning accuracy gain (PAG). Specifically, the PAG gain is around 88%, 80%, and 60% when the number of blocked satellites is one, two, and three, respectively. © 2000-2011 IEEE.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85077815338&doi=10.1109%2fTITS.2019.2894522&partnerID=40&md5=5b7c753255ec78290f9cd4ae80dde36a,IEEE Transactions on Intelligent Transportation Systems,2020
Dynamic Attitude Planning for Trajectory Tracking in Thrust-Vectoring UAVs,"This paper addresses the trajectory tracking control problem for underactuated unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), with specific focus on vehicles with thrust-vectoring capabilities. According to the different actuation mechanisms, the most common UAV platforms can achieve only a partial decoupling of attitude and position tasks. Since position tracking is of utmost importance for applications involving aerial vehicles, we propose a control scheme in which position tracking is the primary objective. To this end, this paper exploits the concept of attitude planner, a dynamical system through which the desired attitude reference is processed to guarantee the satisfaction of the primary objective: The attitude tracking task is considered as a secondary objective, which can be realized as long as the desired trajectory satisfies specific trackability conditions. © 1963-2012 IEEE.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85067860941&doi=10.1109%2fTAC.2019.2919660&partnerID=40&md5=f02e1fa426e44490294688aedc7fd731,IEEE Transactions on Automatic Control,2020
Android HIV: A Study of Repackaging Malware for Evading Machine-Learning Detection,"Machine learning-based solutions have been successfully employed for the automatic detection of malware on Android. However, machine learning models lack robustness to adversarial examples, which are crafted by adding carefully chosen perturbations to the normal inputs. So far, the adversarial examples can only deceive detectors that rely on syntactic features (e.g., requested permissions, API calls, etc.), and the perturbations can only be implemented by simply modifying application's manifest. While recent Android malware detectors rely more on semantic features from Dalvik bytecode rather than manifest, existing attacking/defending methods are no longer effective. In this paper, we introduce a new attacking method that generates adversarial examples of Android malware and evades being detected by the current models. To this end, we propose a method of applying optimal perturbations onto Android APK that can successfully deceive the machine learning detectors. We develop an automated tool to generate the adversarial examples without human intervention. In contrast to existing works, the adversarial examples crafted by our method can also deceive recent machine learning-based detectors that rely on semantic features such as control-flow-graph. The perturbations can also be implemented directly onto APK's Dalvik bytecode rather than Android manifest to evade from recent detectors. We demonstrate our attack on two state-of-the-art Android malware detection schemes, MaMaDroid and Drebin. Our results show that the malware detection rates decreased from 96% to 0% in MaMaDroid, and from 97% to 0% in Drebin, with just a small number of codes to be inserted into the APK. © 2019 IEEE.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85070357934&doi=10.1109%2fTIFS.2019.2932228&partnerID=40&md5=c5930f67b369f1da5ada0973f57293b5,IEEE Transactions on Information Forensics and Security,2020
Secrecy Performance of Terrestrial Radio Links under Collaborative Aerial Eavesdropping,"Motivated to understand the increasingly severe threat of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) to the confidentiality of terrestrial radio links, this paper analyzes the ergodic and ϵ-outage secrecy capacities of the links in the presence of multiple cooperative aerial eavesdroppers flying autonomously in three-dimensional (3D) spaces and exploiting selection combining (SC) or maximal ratio combining (MRC). The 'cut-off' density of the eavesdroppers under which the secrecy capacities vanish is identified. By decoupling the analysis of the random trajectories from the random channel fading, closed-form approximations with almost sure convergence to the secrecy capacities are devised. The analysis is extended to study the impact of the oscillator phase noises and finite memories of the aerial eavesdroppers on the secrecy performance of the ground link. Validated by simulations, the cut-off density only depends on the range of the link in the case of SC eavesdropping, while it depends on the flight region of the eavesdroppers in the case of MRC eavesdropping. © 2005-2012 IEEE.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85072753826&doi=10.1109%2fTIFS.2019.2922353&partnerID=40&md5=5c62546c9047dd4140d4173c109639f0,IEEE Transactions on Information Forensics and Security,2020
Robust Autonomous Navigation of Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) for Warehouses' Inventory Application,"The inventory inspection using autonomous unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) is beneficial in terms of cost, time, and safety of human workers. However, in typical warehouses, it is very challenging for the autonomous UAVs to do inventory task motions safely because aisles are narrow and long, and the illumination is poor. Prior autonomous UAVs are not suitable for such environments, since they suffer from either localization methods prone to disturbance, drift and outliers, or expensive sensors. We present a low-cost sensing system with an extended Kalman filter (EKF)-based multi-sensor fusion framework to achieve practical autonomous navigation of UAVs in warehouse environments. To overcome the inherent drift, outliers, and disturbance problems of naïve UAV localization methods, we suggest 1) exploiting component test of Mahalanobis norm to reject outliers efficiently, 2) introducing pseudo-covariance to incorporate a visual SLAM algorithm, and 3) recognizing floor lanes to get absolute information-as robust data fusion methods. Exemplar results are provided to demonstrate the effectiveness of the methods.

Experimental and numerical investigation of the hydrodynamic characteristics of Autonomous Underwater Vehicles over sea-beds with complex topography,"Improved designs for Autonomous Underwater Vehicles (AUV) are becoming increasingly important due to their utility in academic and industrial applications. However, a majority of such testing and design is carried out under conditions that may not reflect the operating environment of shallow water AUVs. This may lead to imprecise estimations of the AUV's performance and sub-optimal designs. This article presents experimental and numerical studies carried out in conjunction, to investigate the hydrodynamic characteristics of AUV hulls at different Reynolds numbers over sloped channel-beds. We carry out experiments to measure the velocity field and turbulent statistics around the AUV with quantified uncertainty. These are contrasted against corresponding flat bed experiments to gauge the effect of test bed topography on AUV performance. The experimental data was used to validate Reynolds Stress Model predictions. Hydrodynamic parameters such as drag, pressure and skin friction coefficients were predicted from the RSM simulations at different test bed slopes, angles of attack and drift angles of the AUV hull, to analyze the hydrodynamic performance of the AUV. The results presented in this article offer avenues for design improvement of AUVs operating in shallow environments, such as the continental slope and estuaries. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85078398716&doi=10.1016%2fj.oceaneng.2020.106978&partnerID=40&md5=28534374a102401481ef468a5c8513f9,Ocean Engineering,2020
The Optimal Distance Threshold for Fractional Frequency Reuse in Size-Scalable Networks,"In the fractional frequency reuse (FFR) system, the bandwidth is partitioned into orthogonal subbands such that users in the cell-center region use the subbands of a frequency reuse factor (FR factor) equal to 1, whereas users in the cell-edge region exploit the subbands of an FR factor larger than 1. The distance threshold, which is used to distinguish the cell-edge region from the cell-center region, is an important factor in FFR system performance. In this paper, we study the optimal distance threshold to maximize system throughput in the downlink cellular networks, including aerial base stations. Subject to the constraint that a given target outage probability is satisfied, the optimal distance threshold is analyzed as a function of the cell size. It is proven that when the sizes of all cells in the network are scaled at the same rate, the optimal distance threshold normalized by the cell size is nondecreasing in the cell size. The analytical results in this paper provide a system design guideline for initial planning of FFR cellular networks of different sizes, including macro, pico, and femto systems. In particular, for size-scalable aerial networks comprising base stations in the sky, such as balloons or unmanned aerial vehicles, our analysis offers insight into the design of the distance threshold with regard to the cell size. © 1965-2011 IEEE.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85079628627&doi=10.1109%2fTAES.2019.2943048&partnerID=40&md5=0925a790360a2423b838776bd10bf74e,IEEE Transactions on Aerospace and Electronic Systems,2020
Cloud Computing-Based Analyses to Predict Vehicle Driving Shockwave for Active Safe Driving in Intelligent Transportation System,"In the cloud computing era, the analyses of various types of big data gathered from the Internet of Vehicles, the Internet of Things, and smart sensors/devices achieve convenient services. Some famous applications include vehicle traffic loading on roads (from Google MAP), video sharing for fans group (from Facebook or Youtube), and so on. However, to achieve real-Time active safe driving (RT-ASD) under unstable driving in high-Threat areas on roads becomes an open issue in cloud computing-based intelligent transportation system. This paper proposes a predictive backward shockwave analysis approach (PSA) to achieve the RT-ASD based on the analyses of macroscopic traffic shockwave (PSAMA) and microscopic car-following (PSAmi). The PSA contributes in several aspects to active safe driving: 1) predicting and analyzing high threat of backward shockwaves from the gathered big data of the driving state information vehicles; 2) informing the analyzed threat messages to the vehicles in high-Threat areas via the 3-Tier hierarchical cloud computing mechanism; 3) reducing the driving threat certainly; and 4) PSAMA and PSAmi can be applied for achieving active safe driving in autonomous self-driving vehicles and human-driving vehicles. The numerical results show that the PSA outperforms in approaches to relative error rate prediction, the accuracy of the backward shockwave determination, average vehicle velocity, average travel time, number of goodput vehicles, time-To-collision, and distance-To-collision. © 2000-2011 IEEE.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85079347927&doi=10.1109%2fTITS.2019.2902529&partnerID=40&md5=0d1a1353ab463fbec95f1d733062a049,IEEE Transactions on Intelligent Transportation Systems,2020
Optimal robust trajectory tracking control of a X-rudder AUV with velocity sensor failures and uncertainties,"This paper presents an optimal robust control method for trajectory tracking of a X-rudder autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV) subjects to velocity sensor failures and uncertainties. Two reduced-order extended state observers (ESOs) are designed to estimate the surge and heave velocities, and the estimated values are used to replace all the linear velocity-related parameters in controller design, which helps releasing the requirements of linear velocities measurement and makes the controller robust against linear velocity sensor failures. In kinematics control loop, line-of-sight (LOS) guidance law and Lyapunov-based control are employed, and the unknown attack angle is calculated based on the estimated linear velocities. In dynamics control loop, a robust disturbance rejection control law is constructed using disturbance observers and modified terminal sliding mode control. Moreover, a multi-objective optimization method is proposed to achieve X-rudder allocation, which is not only energy efficient but also robust against rudder failures, and helps tackling the rudder input saturation problem at the same time. Finally, comparative numerical simulations are provided to demonstrate the robustness and effectiveness of the proposed approach. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85078728874&doi=10.1016%2fj.oceaneng.2020.106949&partnerID=40&md5=b4239db81d0e7bb4910f1e5881481ee5,Ocean Engineering,2020
A forward-looking SONAR and dynamic model-based AUV navigation strategy: Preliminary validation with FeelHippo AUV,"Reliable navigation systems are fundamental for Autonomous Underwater Vehicles (AUVs) to perform complex tasks and missions. It is well known that the Global Positioning System (GPS) cannot be employed in underwater scenarios; thus, during missions below the sea's surface the real-time position is usually obtained with expensive sensors, such as the Doppler Velocity Log (DVL), integrated within a navigation filter such as an Extended Kalman Filter (EKF), Unscented Kalman Filter (UKF), or Dead Reckoning (DR) strategies. The goal of this work is to develop an underwater navigation system that does not rely on a DVL and where linear speed estimations are obtained exploiting data from a Forward-Looking SONAR (FLS) or, in its absence, taking advantage of a dynamic model that presents a reduced set of parameters. The proposed solution is validated through the use of navigation data obtained during sea trials undertaken in July 2018 with FeelHippo AUV at La Spezia (Italy), at the NATO Science and Technology Organization Center for Maritime Research and Experimentation (CMRE). © 2019 Elsevier Ltd",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85076462037&doi=10.1016%2fj.oceaneng.2019.106770&partnerID=40&md5=b7508645f9ed90fa15eb7b6baf74448c,Ocean Engineering,2020
Fog-Based Multi-Class Dispatching and Charging for Autonomous Electric Mobility On-Demand,"Despite the significant advances in vehicle automation and electrification, the next-decade aspirations for massive deployments of autonomous electric mobility on demand (AEMoD) services in big cities are still threatened by two major bottlenecks, namely, the communication/computation and charging delays. In order to target the communication/computation delays, the paper suggests the exploitation of fog-based architectures for localized AEMoD system operations. These emerging architectures are soon to become widely used, allowing for all localized operational decisions to be made with very low latency by fog controllers located close to the end applications (e.g., each city zone for AEMoD systems). As for the charging delays, an optimized multi-class charging and dispatching queuing model, with partial charging option for AEMoD vehicles is developed for each of these zones. The stability conditions of this model and the optimal number of classes are then derived. The decisions on the proportions of each class vehicles to partially/fully charge or directly serve customers are optimized to minimize the maximum and average system response times using convex optimization and Lagrangian analysis. The results show the merits of our proposed model and optimized decision scheme compared to both the always-charge and the equal-split scheme. Furthermore, the comparison of the maximum and average response time minimization results shows a very low variance in performance, which suggests by using the linear programming solution for lower complexity. © 2000-2011 IEEE.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85079332732&doi=10.1109%2fTITS.2019.2897121&partnerID=40&md5=7e32f5519a3ee98d6e31e502cbe2f436,IEEE Transactions on Intelligent Transportation Systems,2020
IoT-Based Electric Vehicle State Estimation and Control Algorithms under Cyber Attacks,"In order to provide intelligent services, the Internet-of-Things (IoT) facilitates millions of smart devices to be enabled with network connectivity to sense, collect, process, and exchange information. Based on the communication infrastructure, the IoT can allow cyber-physical devices, such as an electric vehicle, to sense, monitor, and control from the remote control center in real time. Unfortunately, the traditional communication infrastructure is vulnerable to cyber attacks, so it is a challenging task for the IoT to explore these applications. In order to overcome the problem, this article proposes an algorithm for monitoring and controlling the electric vehicle using the IoT communication network considering false data-injection attacks. First, the driverless electric vehicle with onboard vision system is represented by a state-space framework. As the electric vehicle and monitoring control center are far away, the IoT-embedded smart sensors and actuators are used to measure and control the system states. The vehicle sensing information is transmitted to the control center over an unreliable communication channel where attacks happen. Based on the mean square error principle, the optimal state estimation algorithm is derived to know and visualize the vehicle states. In order to regulate the vehicle states, the optimal control algorithm is designed based on the semidefinite programming approach. The simulation results show that the proposed algorithms are able to properly estimate and regulate the vehicle states within a short period of time. © 2014 IEEE.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85079798251&doi=10.1109%2fJIOT.2019.2946093&partnerID=40&md5=d8595b1cf8046a9293b30a65faeb0c7f,IEEE Internet of Things Journal,2020
Optimal Dynamic Pricing for Trading-Off User Utility and Operator Profit in Smart Grid,"A conventional power grid is criticized by its poor capability of power usage management, especially in handling dynamically varying power demands over time. The concept of smart grid has been introduced to mitigate this problem by satisfying not only real-time power demands, but also by restricting power usage within the capacity. Its consistent outperformance and new perspective in computer intelligence to control the grid for autonomous power consumption has been gradually replacing the conventional power grid. However, even in smart grid, providing high satisfaction to users often leads smart grid operator (SGO) to loss and vice versa. In this paper, we develop an optimal dynamic pricing mechanism for trading-off (ODPT), for SGOs that tradeoff between user utility and operator profit in smart grid systems. It allows the operator to purchase power from multiple energy producers and to set selling price to users dynamically following the demand-supply theory of economics. It also exploits an artificial neural network model to more accurately predict the power usage. The simulation results, carried out on a commercially available optimization modeling tool using practical power usage data, prove the effectiveness of the proposed ODPT in increasing the operator profit while satisfying user demands. © 2013 IEEE.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85059048079&doi=10.1109%2fTSMC.2017.2764442&partnerID=40&md5=db43e14be78801e882fa1cf384752a0d,"IEEE Transactions on Systems, Man, and Cybernetics: Systems",2020
Real-time sensor anomaly detection and identification in automated vehicles,"Connected and automated vehicles (CAVs) are expected to revolutionize the transportation industry, mainly through allowing for a real-time and seamless exchange of information between vehicles and roadside infrastructure. Although connectivity and automation are projected to bring about a vast number of benefits, they can give rise to new challenges in terms of safety, security, and privacy. To navigate roadways, CAVs need to heavily rely on their sensor readings and the information received from other vehicles and roadside units. Hence, anomalous sensor readings caused by either malicious cyber attacks or faulty vehicle sensors can result in disruptive consequences and possibly lead to fatal crashes. As a result, before the mass implementation of CAVs, it is important to develop methodologies that can detect anomalies and identify their sources seamlessly and in real time. In this paper, we develop an anomaly detection approach through combining a deep learning method, namely convolutional neural network (CNN), with a well-established anomaly detection method, and Kalman filtering with a χ2-detector, to detect and identify anomalous behavior in CAVs. Our numerical experiments demonstrate that the developed approach can detect anomalies and identify their sources with high accuracy, sensitivity, and F1 score. In addition, this developed approach outperforms the anomaly detection and identification capabilities of both CNNs and Kalman filtering with a χ2-detector method alone. It is envisioned that this research will contribute to the development of safer and more resilient CAV systems that implement a holistic view toward intelligent transportation system (ITS) concepts. © 2000-2011 IEEE.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85064620660&doi=10.1109%2fTITS.2019.2906038&partnerID=40&md5=3da9af6202d1a7a64969b71c2806cf42,IEEE Transactions on Intelligent Transportation Systems,2020
Cyber Vulnerability Intelligence for Internet of Things Binary,"Internet of Things (IoT) integrates a variety of software (e.g., autonomous vehicles and military systems) in order to enable the advanced and intelligent services. These software increase the potential of cyber-attacks because an adversary can launch an attack using system vulnerabilities. Existing software vulnerability analysis methods used to be relying on human experts crafted features, which usually miss many vulnerabilities. It is important to develop an automatic vulnerability analysis system to improve the countermeasures. However, source code is not always available (e.g., most IoT related industry software are closed source). Therefore, vulnerability detection on binary code is a demanding task. This article addresses the automatic binary-level software vulnerability detection problem by proposing a deep learning-based approach. The proposed approach consists of two phases: binary function extraction, and model building. First, we extract binary functions from the cleaned binary instructions obtained by using IDA Pro. Then, we employ the attention mechanism on top of a bidirectional long short-term memory for building the predictive model. To show the effectiveness of the proposed approach, we have collected datasets from several different sources. We have compared our proposed approach with a series of baselines including source code-based techniques and binary code-based techniques. We have also applied the proposed approach to real-world IoT related software such as VLC media player and LibTIFF project that used on Autonomous Vehicles. Experimental results show that our proposed approach betters the baselines and is able to detect more vulnerabilities. © 2005-2012 IEEE.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85078409542&doi=10.1109%2fTII.2019.2942800&partnerID=40&md5=f8a1f210adb7a1415bbc44d18188f0d3,IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics,2020
Distributed Estimation in Multimissile Cyber-Physical Systems with Time Delay,"In this article a widely studied consensus algorithm for processing sensor data of multimissile systems is considered. A novelty of algorithms to reach a consensus given time-delay constraints is introduced. In previous work, the author proposed an algorithm addressing the same problem. The primary goal of this article is to evaluate the performance of the proposed algorithm. The performance was evaluated in Monte Carlo runs in a target tracking scenario. A mission with multimissile trying to intercept a single flying threat is assumed in this scenario. The interceptors are using nonhomogeneous sensors to measure the location of the threat continuously. Each missile computes its state prediction and shares it with its neighboring missile only. However, the shared information is applied to arbitrary nonuniform time delay. The entire group of missiles must reach a consensus on the target's location. The performance is evaluated in terms of overall estimation error, conflict resolution, and time to reach a consensus. Different scenarios are also simulated to examine the effectiveness of the number of missiles performing observation, the delay value, and sensor uncertainty in the overall system stability. Moreover, the tradeoffs of using the algorithm are identified. © 2007-2012 IEEE.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85081594953&doi=10.1109%2fJSYST.2019.2959546&partnerID=40&md5=12976ae83eb87c269f543388d3f62840,IEEE Systems Journal,2020
A Hybrid Command Governor Scheme for Rotary Wings Unmanned Aerial Vehicles,"In this paper, we develop an obstacle avoidance control scheme for autonomous aerial vehicles. The strategy is based on command governor (CG) ideas that are here extended to take into account nonconvex constraints typically arising in path planning obstacle avoidance problems. As one of its main merits, the collision avoidance task is accomplished by exploiting convex inner approximations of the obstacle-free region and an ad hoc constraints switching procedure which significantly reduces the online computations pertaining to the CG design. Experimental results on the quadrotor Qball-X4 show the applicability and effectiveness of the proposed approach. © 2018 IEEE.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85057838058&doi=10.1109%2fTCST.2018.2880936&partnerID=40&md5=13ac78d809659c2d5a257db1d7b946a0,IEEE Transactions on Control Systems Technology,2020
CB-PS: An Efficient Short-Certificate-Based Proxy Signature Scheme for UAVs,"Recently, the deployment and usage of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) to monitor and track a geographical region have been increased exponentially. The network infrastructure designed to deploy UAVs consists of sensors, actuators, and other communication smart devices for data collection and processing. As security and privacy is one of the challenging tasks in such an environment, so to design an efficient and secure data dissemination scheme is a challenging task due to limited storage and computation power of UAVs. To mitigate various attacks in such an environment, several efficient signature schemes were proposed in the literature. However, none of these schemes work well due to high computation and communication costs. To overcome these challenges, this paper presents a short proxy signature (CB-PS) scheme in certificate-based setting. Due to implicit usage of certificates, CB-PS solves inherent key escrow of ID-based designated verifier proxy signature. It also eliminates the necessity of secret key distribution in ID-based schemes. The proposed CB-PS scheme is adaptively unforgeable in a random oracle model. It is also efficient with respect to both signature length and computational complexity. The comparison of computational costs reveals that the proposed scheme consumes the least cost 15.45 ms in comparison to the costs of existing competitive schemes. © 2007-2012 IEEE.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85081687219&doi=10.1109%2fJSYST.2019.2921798&partnerID=40&md5=68803ced753ad0fe92d91cc4fd4ef259,IEEE Systems Journal,2020
Distributed guidance law design for multi-UAV multi-direction attack based on reducing surrounding area,"In this paper, two cooperative guidance laws based on the encircled area around a target by multi-attacker are designed to deal with the problem of cooperative encirclement and simultaneous attack under condition of both known target acceleration and unknown target acceleration, which guarantees that the attackers hit the target from every prescribed angle and achieve the best effect. The acceleration components along the attacker-target line of sight in novel guidance laws can reduce the relative remaining distance between each of the attackers and the target at the same speed, thus completing simultaneous attack and avoiding the calculation of the remaining time. The components of the guidance laws perpendicular to the attacker-target line of sight can make the normal overload of relative motion zero, so that the trajectory will be smooth and the collision problem within the attacker can be avoided. Simulation results verified the practicability of the novel guidance laws. © 2019 Elsevier Masson SAS",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85075885295&doi=10.1016%2fj.ast.2019.105571&partnerID=40&md5=6f8692312f3af300167da9da63c59ab2,Aerospace Science and Technology,2020
Learning Pugachev's Cobra Maneuver for Tail-Sitter UAVs Using Acceleration Model,"The Pugachev's cobra maneuver is a dramatic and demanding maneuver requiring the aircraft to fly at extremely high Angle of Attacks (AOA) where stalling occurs. This paper considers this maneuver on tail-sitter UAVs. We present a simple yet very effective feedback-iterative learning position control structure to regulate the altitude error and lateral displacement during the maneuver. Both the feedback controller and the iterative learning controller are based on the aircraft acceleration model, which is directly measurable by the onboard accelerometer. Moreover, the acceleration model leads to an extremely simple dynamic model that does not require any model identification in designing the position controller, greatly simplifying the implementation of the iterative learning control.

Augmenting Vehicle Localization by Cooperative Sensing of the Driving Environment: Insight on Data Association in Urban Traffic Scenarios,"Precise vehicle positioning is a key element for the development of Cooperative Intelligent Transport Systems (C-ITS). In this context, we present a distributed processing technique to augment the performance of conventional Global Navigation Satellite Systems (GNSS) exploiting Vehicle-to-anything (V2X) communication systems. We propose a method, referred to as Implicit Cooperative Positioning with Data Association (ICP-DA), where the connected vehicles detect a set of passive features in the driving environment, solve the association task by pairing them with on-board sensor measurements and cooperatively localize the features to enhance the GNSS accuracy. We adopt a belief propagation algorithm to distribute the processing over the network, and solve both the data association and localization problems locally at vehicles. Numerical results on realistic traffic networks show that the ICP-DA method is able to significantly outperform the conventional GNSS. In particular, the analysis on a real urban road infrastructure highlights the robustness of the proposed method in real-life cases where the interactions among vehicles evolve over space and time according to traffic regulation mechanisms. Performances are investigated both in conventional traffic-light regulated scenarios and self-regulated environments (as representative of future automated driving scenarios) where vehicles autonomously cross the intersections taking gap-availability decisions for avoiding collisions. The analysis shows how the mutual coordination in platoons of vehicles eases the cooperation process and increases the positioning performance. © 2000-2011 IEEE.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85082884010&doi=10.1109%2fTITS.2019.2941435&partnerID=40&md5=e06009efb27ababcdc5a0b1c80af55cc,IEEE Transactions on Intelligent Transportation Systems,2020
Attack Analysis and Resilient Control Design for Discrete-Time Distributed Multi-Agent Systems,"This work analyzes the adverse effects of cyber-physical attacks on discrete-time distributed multi-agent systems, and proposes a mitigation approach for attacks on sensors and actuators. First, we show how an attack on a single node snowballs into a network-wide attack and even destabilizes the entire system. Next, to overcome the adversarial effects of attacks on sensors and actuators, a distributed adaptive attack compensator is designed by estimating the normal expected behavior of agents. The adaptive attack compensator is augmented with the controller and it is shown that the proposed controller achieves secure consensus in the presence of the attacks on sensors and actuators. No restrictive assumption on the number of agents under adversarial input is assumed. Moreover, it recovers compromised agents under actuator attacks and avoids propagation of attacks on sensors without discarding information from the compromised agents. Finally, numerical simulations validate the effectiveness of the presented theoretical contributions on a network of Sentry autonomous underwater vehicles. © 2016 IEEE.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85077792723&doi=10.1109%2fLRA.2019.2959726&partnerID=40&md5=5147a5914a327677f8be4a6899e9dfff,IEEE Robotics and Automation Letters,2020
Poisoning and Evasion Attacks against Deep Learning Algorithms in Autonomous Vehicles,"With the ongoing development and improvement of deep learning technology, autonomous vehicles (AVs) have made tremendous progress in recent years. Despite its great potential, AV supported by deep learning technology still faces numerous security threats, which prevent AV from being putting into large-scale practice. Aiming at this challenging situation, in this paper, we would like to exploit two attacks against deep learning algorithms in traffic sign recognition system by leveraging particle swarm optimization. Specifically, we first exploit the PAPSO (poisoning attack with particle swarm optimization) which focuses on the training process of the deep learning algorithms in the traffic sign recognition system, i.e., the attacker injects crafted samples into the training dataset, causing a reduction in classification accuracy of the traffic sign recognition system. Then, we also explore the EAPSO (evasion attack with particle swarm optimization) which on the other hand focuses on the interference process of the deep learning algorithms, i.e., the attacker adds some hardly perceptible perturbations to the targeted test sample, leading to a misclassification on it. Extensive experiments are conducted to shed light on the effectiveness of our attacks, and some corresponding defense strategies are also presented. © 1967-2012 IEEE.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85083850624&doi=10.1109%2fTVT.2020.2977378&partnerID=40&md5=bf6be1b94c61c51f496305a40ffaa64b,IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology,2020
Experimental and numerical study on underwater radiated noise of AUV,"The wide range use of marine equipment has greatly increased the underwater radiated noise (URN) level, creating more threat to marine life. Autonomous underwater vehicle is one of the solutions to reduce the use of large marine equipment and then decrease the noise. Aiming at the noise control of AUV, this study conducted a far field noise measurement experiment on an AUV working on 10 different conditions, which is rarely measured. The hybrid method, predicting the noise with Lighthill equation based on unsteady flow field data from CFD calculation, is adopted. The results from experiment and simulation indicates that the simulative results are in good agreements with experimental results and the propeller will still generate noise due to the irregular vibration of the propeller, which is about 3–5 dB. With the occurrence of cavitation, the sound pressure level (SPL) increases sharply, and there will be a wide gap between experimental and simulative noise data, owing to the single phase considered in the Lighthill equation. The analysis of the experimental and simulative results highlights the existence of structure excitation noise, ranging from 300 to 500 Hz and the shortcoming of noise prediction of the hybrid method under cavitation stage. © 2020",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85079598939&doi=10.1016%2fj.oceaneng.2020.107111&partnerID=40&md5=6418bc5c64aa5ef58e0392f46eb1412b,Ocean Engineering,2020
"Exploiting Singular Configurations for Controllable, Low-Power Friction Enhancement on Unmanned Ground Vehicles","This letter describes the design, validation, and performance of a new type of adaptive wheel morphology for unmanned ground vehicles. Our adaptive wheel morphology uses a spiral cam to create a system that enables controllable deployment of high friction surfaces. The overall design is modular, battery powered, and can be mounted directly to the wheels of a vehicle without additional wiring. The use of a tailored cam profile exploits a singular configuration to minimize power consumption when deployed and protects the actuator from external forces. Component-level experiments demonstrate that friction on ice and grass can be increased by up to 170%. Two prototypes were installed on a 1:5 scale, radio-controlled rally car and tested.

Waveguide-Invariant-Based Ranging and Receiver Localization Using Tonal Sources of Opportunity,"Acoustic emissions from cargo ships transiting coastal waterways, measured by a single hydrophone, can be exploited to estimate both the time-varying source-receiver range and receiver location. In this paper, two parameter-search-based maximum-likelihood estimators are presented: one for \beta, the waveguide invariant parameter, and one for source range. \beta characterizes the interference structure inherent to ducted acoustic propagation and is central to the spectral analysis involved in the range estimation. The source ranging method extends prior work by the authors and focuses on the strong narrowband tonals that typically dominate the acoustic spectra of cargo ships. Source ranging results are presented using real data from the SWellEx-96 experiment and are shown to be in close agreement with simulation results obtained using the KRAKEN normal mode program. A technique for estimating the position of a receiver, which can be stationary or moving, is also proposed. The localization technique requires knowledge of the source track, hydrophone data, and an initial estimate of the receiver's position. An application to autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV) navigation is included in which the waveguide-invariant-based range estimates are used to mitigate the position estimation error due to drift in inertial measurement units on submerged AUVs. A specific scenario is examined, using SWellEx-96 data, in which an initial position error of 3 km is reduced to under 1 km using the proposed technique. © 1976-2012 IEEE.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85061061672&doi=10.1109%2fJOE.2018.2883855&partnerID=40&md5=5cde46eaec61ed8d2c3e8041ffa85bd6,IEEE Journal of Oceanic Engineering,2020
GaitMesh: Controller-Aware Navigation Meshes for Long-Range Legged Locomotion Planning in Multi-Layered Environments,"Long-range locomotion planning is an important problem for the deployment of legged robots to real scenarios. Current methods used for legged locomotion planning often do not exploit the flexibility of legged robots, and do not scale well with environment size. In this letter we propose the use of navigation meshes for deployment in large-scale multi-floor sites. We leverage this representation to improve long-term locomotion plans in terms of success rates, path costs and reasoning about which gait-controller to use when. We show that NavMeshes have higher planning success rates than sampling-based planners, but are 400x faster to construct and at least 100x faster to plan with. The performance gap further increases when considering multi-floor environments. We present both a procedure for building controller-aware NavMeshes and a full navigation system that adapts to changes to the environment. We demonstrate the capabilities of the system in simulation experiments and in field trials at a real-world oil rig facility. © 2016 IEEE.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85083758131&doi=10.1109%2fLRA.2020.2979628&partnerID=40&md5=943edbf92c05107ce4bcac27f9c48de2,IEEE Robotics and Automation Letters,2020
Wildfire Fighting by Unmanned Aerial System Exploiting Its Time-Varying Mass,"This letter presents an approach for accurately dropping a relatively large amount of fire retardant, water or some other extinguishing agent onto a wildfire from an autonomous unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV), in close proximity to the epicenter of the fire. The proposed approach involves a risky maneuver outside of the safe flight envelope of the UAV. This maneuver exploits the expected weight reduction resulting from the release of the payload, enabling the UAV to recover without impacting the terrain. The UAV is tilted to high pitch angles, at which the thrust may be pointed almost horizontally. The vehicle can therefore achieve higher horizontal speeds than would be allowed by conventional motion planners. This high speed allows the UAV to significantly reduce the time spent close to the fire. As a result, the overall high heat exposure is reduced, and the payload can be dropped closer to the target, minimizing its dispersion. A constrained optimal control problem (OCP) is solved taking into account environmental parameters such as wind and terrain gradients, as well as various payload releasing mechanisms. The proposed approach was verified in simulations and in real experiments. Emphasis was put on the real time recalculation of the solution, which will enable future adaptation into a model predictive controller (MPC) scheme. © 2016 IEEE.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85080899618&doi=10.1109%2fLRA.2020.2972827&partnerID=40&md5=6b6b61d222fa98241fc975236eda83e5,IEEE Robotics and Automation Letters,2020
Aerodynamic efficiency and performance enhancement of fixed-wing UAVs,"The present work aims in providing guidelines for the aerodynamic and performance optimization of fixed-wing Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) that operate in the low-speed subsonic regime. Using a combination of textbook methods, low-fidelity and high-fidelity aerodynamic analysis tools, an aerodynamics and drag breakdown analysis is made on a reference UAV wing platform. Then, a complete drag bookkeeping study is made on the corresponding reference UAV configuration, providing the contribution of each part to the total drag budget for various angles of attack. Using the results of the aerodynamic investigations as guide, a thorough drag-reduction technologies screening is made based on existing literature, with the discussion also including integration and realization issues.

Manifold Siamese Network: A Novel Visual Tracking ConvNet for Autonomous Vehicles,"Visual tracking is a vital component of autonomous driving perception system. Siamese networks have achieved great success in both accuracy and speed for visual tracking tasks. These Siamese trackers share a similar framework in which each tracker consists of two network branches for exploring semantic information. However, the performance of Siamese trackers is limited by an insufficient semantic template and an unsatisfactory updating strategy. To tackle these problems, we propose a manifold Siamese network for visual tracking that can simultaneously utilize semantic and geometric information. A manifold sample pool is constructed to exploit the manifold structure of image object sequences. This sample pool is dynamically learned via a fast Gaussian mixture model (GMM). After obtaining a manifold sample template, we design a deep architecture based on a correlation filter (CF) network and append a novel manifold feature branch. The network remains fully convolutional and can train a template to discriminate exemplar image and arbitrarily size search image. Then, a triplet occlusion score function cooperates with an effective update method that is established to prevent model drift. Extensive experiments show that the proposed tracking algorithm performs favorably compared with the state-of-the-art methods on three standard benchmark datasets at a high framerate, which is very suitable for autonomous driving. © 2000-2011 IEEE.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85082885537&doi=10.1109%2fTITS.2019.2930337&partnerID=40&md5=ee489d0bcbf48d78286a9fc3118c7b71,IEEE Transactions on Intelligent Transportation Systems,2020
Vid2Param: Modeling of Dynamics Parameters from Video,"Sensors are routinely mounted on robots to acquire various forms of measurements in spatio-Temporal fields. Locating features within these fields and reconstruction (mapping) of the dense fields can be challenging in resource-constrained situations, such as when trying to locate the source of a gas leak from a small number of measurements. In such cases, a model of the underlying complex dynamics can be exploited to discover informative paths within the field. We use a fluid simulator as a model, to guide inference for the location of a gas leak. We perform localization via minimization of the discrepancy between observed measurements and gas concentrations predicted by the simulator. Our method is able to account for dynamically varying parameters of wind flow (e.g., direction and strength), and its effects on the observed distribution of gas. We develop algorithms for off-line inference as well as for on-line path discovery via active sensing. We demonstrate the efficiency, accuracy and versatility of our algorithm using experiments with a physical robot conducted in outdoor environments. We deploy an unmanned air vehicle (UAV) mounted with a CO_2 sensor to automatically seek out a gas cylinder emitting CO_2 via a nozzle. We evaluate the accuracy of our algorithm by measuring the error in the inferred location of the nozzle, based on which we show that our proposed approach is competitive with respect to state of the art baselines. © 2016 IEEE.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85078317939&doi=10.1109%2fLRA.2019.2959476&partnerID=40&md5=a3668800f7abdbfbfb2fc0f798a82413,IEEE Robotics and Automation Letters,2020
Enhanced Object Detection with Deep Convolutional Neural Networks for Advanced Driving Assistance,"Object detection is a critical problem for advanced driving assistance systems (ADAS). Recently, convolutional neural networks (CNN) achieved large successes on object detection, with performance improvement over traditional approaches, which use hand-engineered features. However, due to the challenging driving environment (e.g., large object scale variation, object occlusion, and bad light conditions), popular CNN detectors do not achieve very good object detection accuracy over the KITTI autonomous driving benchmark dataset. In this paper, we propose three enhancements for CNN-based visual object detection for ADAS. To address the large object scale variation challenge, deconvolution and fusion of CNN feature maps are proposed to add context and deeper features for better object detection at low feature map scales. In addition, soft non-maximal suppression (NMS) is applied across object proposals at different feature scales to address the object occlusion challenge. As the cars and pedestrians have distinct aspect ratio features, we measure their aspect ratio statistics and exploit them to set anchor boxes properly for better object matching and localization. The proposed CNN enhancements are evaluated with various image input sizes by experiments over KITTI dataset. The experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed enhancements with good detection performance over KITTI test set. © 2000-2011 IEEE.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85082884687&doi=10.1109%2fTITS.2019.2910643&partnerID=40&md5=a0f71b90e26fa4efeec898037b788616,IEEE Transactions on Intelligent Transportation Systems,2020
Drones in Distress: A Game-Theoretic Countermeasure for Protecting UAVs Against GPS Spoofing,"One prominent security threat that targets unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) is the capture via global positioning system (GPS) spoofing in which an attacker manipulates a UAV's GPS signals in order to capture it. Given the anticipated widespread deployment of UAVs for various purposes, it is imperative to develop new security solutions against such attacks. In this article, a mathematical framework is introduced for analyzing and mitigating the effects of GPS spoofing attacks on UAVs. In particular, system dynamics are used to model the optimal routes that the UAVs will adopt to reach their destinations. The GPS spoofer's effect on each UAV's route is also captured by the model. To this end, the spoofer's optimal imposed locations on the UAVs, are analytically derived; allowing the UAVs to predict their traveling routes under attack. Then, a countermeasure mechanism is developed to mitigate the effect of the GPS spoofing attack. The countermeasure is built on the premise of cooperative localization, in which a UAV can determine its location using nearby UAVs instead of the possibly compromised GPS locations. To better utilize the proposed defense mechanism, a dynamic Stackelberg game is formulated to model the interactions between a GPS spoofer and a drone operator. In particular, the drone operator acts as the leader that determines its optimal strategy in light of the spoofer's expected response strategy. The equilibrium strategies of the game are then analytically characterized and studied through a novel proposed algorithm. The simulation results show that, when combined with the Stackelberg strategies, the proposed defense mechanism will outperform baseline strategy selection techniques in terms of reducing the possibility of UAV capture. © 2014 IEEE.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85083719294&doi=10.1109%2fJIOT.2019.2963337&partnerID=40&md5=58bc4263f887669ac2fde6d30ab6d1d4,IEEE Internet of Things Journal,2020
Deceiving Image-to-Image Translation Networks for Autonomous Driving with Adversarial Perturbations,"Deep neural networks (DNNs) have achieved impressive performance on handling computer vision problems. However, it has been found that DNNs are vulnerable to adversarial examples. For such reason, adversarial perturbations have been recently studied in several respects. However, most previous works have focused on image classification tasks, and it has never been studied regarding adversarial perturbations on Image-to-image (Im2Im) translation tasks, showing great success in handling paired and/or unpaired mapping problems in the field of autonomous driving and robotics. This letter examines different types of adversarial perturbations that can fool Im2Im frameworks for autonomous driving purposes. We propose both quasi-physical and digital adversarial perturbations that can make Im2Im models yield unexpected results. We then empirically analyze these perturbations and show that they generalize well under both paired for image synthesis and unpaired settings for style transfer. We also validate that there exist some perturbation thresholds over which the Im2Im mapping is disrupted or impossible. The existence of these perturbations reveals that there exist crucial weaknesses in Im2Im models. Lastly, we show that our methods illustrate how perturbations affect the quality of outputs, pioneering the improvement of the robustness of current SOTA networks for autonomous driving. © 2016 IEEE.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85079610239&doi=10.1109%2fLRA.2020.2967289&partnerID=40&md5=eb8f913da523a3e4f2f3420177b434df,IEEE Robotics and Automation Letters,2020
Multimodal Multispectral Imaging System for Small UAVs,"Multispectral imaging is an attractive sensing modality for small unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) in numerous applications. The most compact spectral camera architecture is based on spectral filters in the focal plane. Vehicle movement can be used to scan the scene using multiple bandpass filters arranged perpendicular to the flight direction. With known camera trajectory and scene structure, it is possible to assemble a spectral image in software. In this letter, we demonstrate the feasibility of a novel concept for low-cost wide area multispectral imaging with integrated spectral consistency testing. Six bandpass filters are arranged in a periodically repeating pattern. Since different bands are recorded at different times and in different viewing directions, there is a risk of obtaining spectral artifacts in the image. We exploit the repeated sampling of bands to enable spectral consistency testing, which leads to significantly improved spectral integrity. In addition, an unfiltered region permits conventional 2D video imaging that can be used for image-based navigation and 3D reconstruction. The proposed multimodal imaging system was tested on a UAV in a realistic experiment. The results demonstrate that spectral reconstruction and consistency testing can be performed by image processing alone, based on visual simultaneous localization and mapping (VSLAM). © 2016 IEEE.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85079594029&doi=10.1109%2fLRA.2020.2967301&partnerID=40&md5=e30945cd0dc2523a6ccbc5a175dcba19,IEEE Robotics and Automation Letters,2020
Impacts of Constrained Sensing and Communication Based Attacks on Vehicular Platoons,"Vehicular platooning promises to bring a faster, safer, and more efficient transportation. Automated platooned vehicles will rely on information obtained from inter-vehicle communication channels and on-board sensors to make driving decisions and achieve platooning. However, such reliance creates an opportunity for safety violating attacks intended to disrupt the platoon formation and cause accidents. In this work, we investigate more realistic attacks mounted against the communication and sensing functionalities of platooned vehicles. More specifically, we are interested in approximating the set of final unsafe states, that can be reached by mounting realistically constrained attacks capable of introducing delay and injecting false-data against the aforementioned functionalities. For that purpose, we will use reachability analysis which enables us to realize whether it is possible to drive the platoon from initial to final states given performance and physical bounds. Our results suggest that these two types of attack are able to steer the platoon towards dangerous states and generate impacts on passengers' safety by causing crashes at high speeds. © 2020 IEEE.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85085135899&doi=10.1109%2fTVT.2020.2981003&partnerID=40&md5=dc8d5830113580514712ab0854456f5e,IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology,2020
A secure shuffling mechanism for white-box attack-resistant unmanned vehicles,"Unmanned Vehicles (UVs) have been being utilized for various applications, such as surveillance, search/rescue, and monitoring. The information they transmit is critical for decision-making. However, UVs are vulnerable to white-box attacks due to improvements in reverse engineering techniques and the openness of their software. Therefore, attackers with sufficient knowledge of a target UV can steal secret information stored in the UV by exploiting its vulnerabilities. Recently, several white-box cryptography techniques have been introduced to protect secret keys from being extracted by converting them into large look-up tables. However, none of them provide approaches to securely update the look-up tables. Thus, once a remote attacker succeeds in extracting the static look-up table from a UV, he/she can use it to decrypt past/future communications or to send false information to the control station by impersonating the UV. In this paper, we propose a look-up table shuffling mechanism that supports white-box cryptography with dynamics. The mechanism makes it hard for attackers to determine the positions of the table entries, and thus to decrypt/encrypt ciphertexts/plaintexts. To show the practicality of the block cipher with our mechanism, we implemented it on a board equipped with a GPU and show its GPU-accelerated performance. © 2002-2012 IEEE.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85083177534&doi=10.1109%2fTMC.2019.2903048&partnerID=40&md5=c4b9eaa8316b811e3a923cdea9f5bf99,IEEE Transactions on Mobile Computing,2020
On the Design of Conditional Privacy Preserving Batch Verification-Based Authentication Scheme for Internet of Vehicles Deployment,"In the Internet of Vehicles (IoV), secure information sharing among vehicles is crucial in order to upgrade driving safety as well as to strengthen vehicular services. However, public communication among vehicles leads to various potential attacks, such as replay, man-in-the-middle, impersonation, unlinkability and traceability attacks. To address this issue, we design a new conditional privacy preserving batch verification-based authentication mechanism in the IoV environment using Elliptic Curve Cryptography (ECC) technique, where a vehicle can authenticate its neighbor vehicle and also a Road-Side Unit (RSU) can authenticate its nearby vehicles in a batch. The proposed scheme is shown to be highly secure against a passive/active adversary through various security analysis, such as random oracle based formal security, formal security verification via automated simulation tool, and also informal security analysis. An exhaustive comparative analysis reveals that the proposed scheme offers better security and functionality attributes, and comparable storage, communication and computation overheads when these are compared with the relevant schemes. © 1967-2012 IEEE.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85085172404&doi=10.1109%2fTVT.2020.2981934&partnerID=40&md5=95297bba7b9318ffb133d243570d760b,IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology,2020
Deception Attack Detection and Estimation for a Local Vehicle in Vehicle Platooning Based on a Modified UFIR Estimator,"In this article, the position sensor deception attack detection and estimation problem is investigated for a local vehicle in a vehicle platoon. In a platoon system, the position measurement is critical as the distances between neighboring vehicles are relatively small. However, the position measurement of vehicles is usually vulnerable to deception attacks as it relies on external information, such as GPS and environment information from cameras. Therefore, position sensor deception attack detection and estimation should be addressed for local vehicles in a platoon. To deal with this problem, a linearized model is presented to describe the longitudinal dynamics of a local vehicle. Moreover, modeling uncertainties, measurement noises, and piecewise constant deception attacks injected in position measurement are specified along with this model. Based on this model, a scheme based on a modified unbiased finite impulse response (UFIR) estimator is proposed to generate an intermediate estimated value related only to the attack. Then, the deception attack is recovered based on this value through a function fitting strategy. Based on analysis results, simulations are conducted to verify the effectiveness of the proposed attack detection and estimation scheme. © 2014 IEEE.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85084920302&doi=10.1109%2fJIOT.2020.2966672&partnerID=40&md5=a292c98b2fa485e102c9fb0c42afc2e8,IEEE Internet of Things Journal,2020
Parametric modelling of interacting hydrodynamic forces in 3 DOF for underwater vehicles operating in close proximity,"In this paper we present a parametric model of the hydrodynamic interaction forces for two underwater vehicles operating in close proximity. We first review the models for interacting forces in the horizontal plane of surface vessels and empirical approximations that can be potentially applied to underwater vehicles. Then, based on both potential theory and experimentally derived models available in the literature, we propose a partially-fixed model structure of the hydrodynamic interaction forces. This partially-fixed model structure is used for the identification of a full parametric model for the hydrodynamic interaction forces. The data set considered to validate the model represents a fully-submerged hull shape (an enlarged Explorer AUV hull shape) that moves holding its course at a forward speed and another hull shape (a SUBOFF hull of reduced size) that overtakes Explorer in a parallel course. We exploit the novel model structure together with the experimentally validated data to obtain a parametric model of the interaction forces on the overtaking vessel at different transverse separation distances. We estimate the parameters using one dataset and then validate the model for other sets. The results obtained are considered accurate for the intended purpose of the model, which is the future design of a motion control system for the SUBOFF manoeuvring in close proximity to the Explorer. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85081974032&doi=10.1016%2fj.oceaneng.2020.107231&partnerID=40&md5=cf4dc86e09831266f928e4c47c0b5598,Ocean Engineering,2020
An intelligent cooperative mission planning scheme of UAV swarm in uncertain dynamic environment,"This paper presents an intelligent cooperative mission planning scheme for unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) swarm, to search and attack the time-sensitive moving targets in uncertain dynamic environment, by using a hybrid artificial potential field and ant colony optimization (HAPF-ACO) method. In the search-attack mission environment of UAV swarm under the dynamic topology interaction, a time-sensitive target probability map is established. Based on the HAPF, the target attraction field, threat repulsive field and repulsive field are constructed for the environmental cognition. A distributed ACO algorithm is designed to improve the UAVs' global searching capability. For this mission planning problem, four time-sensitive moving target types and four constraint types of UAV swarm are considered, which will contribute to the practical applications of the HAPF-ACO.

Multiview Scene Image Inpainting Based on Conditional Generative Adversarial Networks,"With the help of a multiview system, an unmanned vehicle system can better understand the surrounding environment and choose a more accurate and safer path to avoid obstacles. However, due to the interference of the signal or the loss of part of the signal during the acquisition, processing, compression, transmission and decompression of the video image signal, the local area of the image is abnormal, which affects the perception and decision of the system. This article addresses the problems of inaccurate restored images and noise in the restored images by proposing an image restoration method that is applied to a multicamera system. We utilize different perspective images captured by different cameras to assist and constrain the restoration of the damaged image. This method restores the image by combining sample representations and sample distribution models which respectively based on self-encoder reconstruction loss learning and generative adversarial networks. In this method, the infrastructure is a conditional generative adversarial network, the condition is the images that are from the other perspectives, and the generator is a self-encoder structure with cross-layer connection, group convolution and feature map channel exchanged. This method was carried out on a dataset recorded in Zurich using a pair of cameras mounted on a mobile platform. The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method is superior to the existing methods in terms of mean L1 Loss, mean L2 Loss and the peak signal to noise ratio (PSNR). © 2016 IEEE.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85085712630&doi=10.1109%2fTIV.2019.2955907&partnerID=40&md5=959ba8b9aa868883745552915d85bd81,IEEE Transactions on Intelligent Vehicles,2020
A Stabilized Feedback Episodic Memory (SF-EM) and Home Service Provision Framework for Robot and IoT Collaboration,"The automated home referred to as Smart Home is expected to offer fully customized services to its residents, reducing the amount of home labor, thus improving human beings' welfare. Service robots and Internet of Things (IoT) play the key roles in the development of Smart Home. The service provision with these two main components in a Smart Home environment requires: 1) learning and reasoning algorithms and 2) the integration of robot and IoT systems. Conventional computational intelligence-based learning and reasoning algorithms do not successfully manage dynamic changes in the Smart Home data, and the simple integrations fail to fully draw the synergies from the collaboration of the two systems. To tackle these limitations, we propose: 1) a stabilized memory network with a feedback mechanism which can learn user behaviors in an incremental manner and 2) a robot-IoT service provision framework for a Smart Home which utilizes the proposed memory architecture as a learning and reasoning module and exploits synergies between the robot and IoT systems. We conduct a set of comprehensive experiments under various conditions to verify the performance of the proposed memory architecture and the service provision framework and analyze the experiment results. © 2013 IEEE.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85058159356&doi=10.1109%2fTCYB.2018.2882921&partnerID=40&md5=15fac4d03fbfec797ab090b74d2b4c90,IEEE Transactions on Cybernetics,2020
An Integrated Threat Assessment Algorithm for Decision-Making of Autonomous Driving Vehicles,"In order to decide a safe and reliable trajectory for autonomous driving vehicles, the threat of surrounding vehicles need to be assessed quantitatively and consider the potential risk. This paper proposes a novel integrated threat assessment algorithm for the decision-making system. First, the motion of the surrounding vehicle is predicted probabilistic based on the interact multiple model (IMM) to consider the potential threat. Then, we build an integrated threat assessment function to assess the threat in each state quantitatively and objectively, which synthesizes the existing time-to-collision (TTC), time-headway (TH), and the original proposed time-to-front (TTF). Based on this, the decision-making system is established according to the Markov decision process (MDP) and the feedback value of each decision sequence is calculated by the integrated threat assessment function, thus the safest trajectory for the current moment can be determined by optimal search. Finally, the decision-making system is verified in the overtaking and cut-in scenario by Carsim and Simulink co-simulation. The results show that the proposed threat assessment algorithm for the decision-making system can help autonomous vehicles decide a safe trajectory in real-time and maintain good maneuverability. © 2000-2011 IEEE.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85085947531&doi=10.1109%2fTITS.2019.2919865&partnerID=40&md5=f50f26a389425767af2e2f011aef5fa1,IEEE Transactions on Intelligent Transportation Systems,2020

Dynamic facial presentation attack detection for automated border control systems,"Millions of passengers travel every day, border crossing being one of their most common activities. At these points it is extremely important that security is completely guaranteed. However, the maintaining adequate security levels is a very demanding issue. This has promoted the development of systems capable of providing support to border authorities by automatising some of their tasks. Thus, Automated Border Control (ABC) systems have become a key tool. These systems increase the flow of travellers as they can achieve fast evaluations of individuals through their machine-readable travel documents. However, this has motivated the appearance of attacks that try to avoid the identity detection of individuals by these systems. Presentation Attack Detection (PAD) algorithms have emerged to mitigate such a problem. This paper presents the On-the-Fly Presentation Attack Detection (FlyPAD) framework that implements a set of dynamic PAD techniques. It allows multiple types of attacks to be detected as the traveller approaches the ABC system, rather than being static in front of the cameras.

Malicious user detection for cooperative mobility tracking in autonomous driving,"The mobility status of self and surrounding vehicles provides important information to various tasks in autonomous driving (AD) and intelligent transportation system (ITS). Accordingly, a precise, stable, and robust mobility tracking framework is essential. Compared with self-tracking that relies only on mobility observations from onboard sensors [e.g., global positioning system (GPS), inertial measurement unit (IMU), and camera], cooperative tracking markedly increases the precision and reliability of the mobility information by integrating observations from roadside units (RSUs) and nearby vehicles through vehicle-to-everything (V2X) communications in the Internet of Vehicles (IoV). Nevertheless, cooperative tracking can be quite vulnerable if there are malicious users sending bogus observations in the cooperative network. In this article, we present a malicious user detection framework, which includes two sequential detection algorithms and a secure mobility data exchange and fusion model to detect and remove bogus mobility information and integrate proposed detection algorithms with previous data fusion algorithms, which secures the cooperative mobility tracking in AD, ITS.

Adaptive bit loading with reduced computational time and complexity for multicarrier wireless communications,"This correspondence presents an efficient bit loading technique that enables reduction of the time and computational complexity requirements for mobile wireless multicarrier communications, while satisfying certain bit-error-rate constraints. The complexity reduction is achieved by exploiting the channel correlation to reduce the number of subcarriers involved in the bit loading process, and consequently, the required computational time is reduced significantly. The computational complexity of the bit allocation process can be designed to match the system computational capabilities by deriving a theoretical upper bound on the average number of subcarriers involved in the bit loading process.

A machine learning approach for estimating air data parameters of small fixed-wing UAVs using distributed pressure sensors,"This paper presents a method for estimating the air data parameters for a small fixed-wing, unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) using an arrangement of low-cost Micro-electromechinal systems (MEMS)-based pressure sensors embedded in the surface of the UAV. The pressure measurements are used in a machine learning (ML) model to estimate the angle of attack, sideslip angle, and airspeed. Two ML algorithms based on artificial neural networks (NNs) and linear regression (LR) are implemented, tested, and assessed using data collected from wind tunnel experiments and a flight test, and the results are compared to a benchmark flight test. Training the ML algorithms using wind tunnel data was found to introduce several potential error sources that need to be addressed in order to provide accurate estimation on the benchmark flight test, whereas training the algorithms using flight data provides lower estimation RMSE values. The performance of the NN structures has been found to slightly outperform the LR algorithms in estimation accuracy.

Modeling and analyzing cyberattack effects on connected automated vehicular platoons,"Vehicular platooning requires an open-access environment of vehicle communications to enable cooperating connected automated vehicles (CAVs) to share their travel information. However, the open-access environment makes the cooperating platoon CAVs vulnerable to cyberattacks, causing concerns on traffic safety and mobility. So far, due to the lack of analytical models integrating malicious effects of manipulated information into CAV dynamics, we have limited knowledge on CAV platoon performance under cyberattack. It necessities a modeling framework to support a comprehensive analysis of the CAV platoon performance in a capricious travel environment. This study seeks to bridge this critical gap from the following three aspects. First, we review potential safety-related cyberattacks faced by CAVs, related to manipulation of vehicle position, speed, and acceleration. Based on the review, these cyberattacks are categorized into three types: bogus messages, replay/delay, and collusion attack. Second, we develop a generalized vehicle dynamics model that accounts for the cyberattack effects on CAV dynamics. The proposed model, labeled cooperative intelligent driver model (CIDM), integrates the dynamic communication topological structure to enable the analysis of effects of manipulated information on CAV dynamics. The dynamic communication structure is a time-varying function which is determined by the communication range and the distance between two vehicles. Upon the proposed CIDM, the third aspect focuses on simulation analysis of CAV platoon safety and efficiency under cyberattacks, which demonstrate the cyberattack effects at the platoon level. This study contributes to the fundamental understanding of CAV platoon dynamics under cyberattacks and lays a foundation to enhance the cybersecurity of CAV systems. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85082872041&doi=10.1016%2fj.trc.2020.102625&partnerID=40&md5=5e32ec8a68decee1b192ace13866de36,Transportation Research Part C: Emerging Technologies,2020
Energy-Efficient Mobile Crowdsensing by Unmanned Vehicles: A Sequential Deep Reinforcement Learning Approach,"Mobile crowdsensing (MCS) is an attractive and innovative paradigm in which a crowd of users equipped with smart mobile devices (such as smartphones and iPads), and more recently unmanned vehicles (UVs, e.g., driverless cars and drones) conduct sensing tasks in mobile social networks by fully exploiting their carried diverse embedded sensors. These devices, especially UVs, are usually constrained by limited sensing range and energy reserve of devices, which contribute to the restriction of one single UV task performance, and thus UV collaborations are fully favored. In this article, we explicitly consider navigating a group of UVs to collect different kinds of data in a city, with the presence of multiple charging stations. Different from the existing approaches that solve the problem by forming a constrained optimization problem, we propose a novel sequential deep model called 'PPO+LSTM,' which contains a sequential model LSTM and is trained with proximal policy optimization (PPO), for assigning tasks and planning route. We evaluate our model in different network settings when comparing with other state-of-the-art solutions, and we also show the impact of important hyperparameters of our model. Results show that our solution outperforms all others in terms of energy efficiency, data collection ratio, and geographic fairness. © 2014 IEEE.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85089305425&doi=10.1109%2fJIOT.2019.2962545&partnerID=40&md5=ff138538288300d1a182ed69880d05f0,IEEE Internet of Things Journal,2020
Cooperative merging control via trajectory optimization in mixed vehicular traffic,"A major challenging issue related to the emerging mixed traffic vehicular system, composed of connected and automated vehicles (CAVs) together with human-driven vehicles, is the lack of adequate modeling and control framework, especially at traffic bottlenecks such as highway merging areas. A hierarchical control framework for merging areas is first outlined, where we assume that the merging sequence is decided by a higher control level. The focus of this paper is the lower level of the control framework that establishes a set of control algorithms for cooperative CAV trajectory optimization, defined for different merging scenarios in the presence of mixed traffic. To exploit complete cooperation flexibility of the vehicles, we identify six scenarios, consisting of triplets of vehicles, defined based on the different combinations of CAVs and conventional vehicles. For each triplet, different consecutive movement phases along with corresponding desired distance and speed set-points are designed. Through the movement phases, the CAVs engaged in the triplet cooperate to determine their optimal trajectories aiming at facilitating an efficient merging maneuver, while complying with realistic constraints related to safety and comfort of vehicle occupants. Distinct models are considered for each triplet, and a Model Predictive Control scheme is employed to compute the cooperative optimal control inputs, in terms of acceleration of CAVs, accounting also for human-driven vehicles’ uncertainties, such as drivers’ reaction time and desired speed tracing error. Simulation investigations demonstrate that the proposed cooperative merging algorithms ensure efficient and smooth merging maneuvers while satisfying all the prescribed constraints. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85085261278&doi=10.1016%2fj.trc.2020.102663&partnerID=40&md5=77a32e10e30c7fad489a85bb6c909077,Transportation Research Part C: Emerging Technologies,2020
Alternating Minimization Based Trajectory Generation for Quadrotor Aggressive Flight,"With much research has been conducted into trajectory planning for quadrotors, planning with spatial and temporal optimal trajectories in real-time is still challenging. In this letter, we propose a framework for large-scale waypoint-based polynomial trajectory generation, with highlights on its superior computational efficiency and simultaneous spatialoral optimality. Exploiting the implicitly decoupled structure of the problem, we conduct alternating minimization between boundary conditions and time durations of trajectory pieces. Algebraic convenience of both sub-problems is leveraged to escape poor local minima and achieve the lowest time consumption. Theoretical analysis for the global/local convergence rate of our method is provided. Moreover, based on polynomial theory, an extremely fast feasibility checker is designed for various kinds of constraints. By incorporating it into our alternating structure, a constrained minimization algorithm is constructed to optimize trajectories on the premise of feasibility. Benchmark evaluation shows that our algorithm outperforms state-of-the-art waypoint-based methods regarding efficiency, optimality, and scalability. The algorithm can be incorporated in a high-level waypoint planner, which can rapidly search over a three-dimensional space for aggressive autonomous flights. The capability of our algorithm is experimentally demonstrated by quadrotor fast flights in a limited space with dense obstacles. We release our implementation as an open-source ros-package. © 2016 IEEE.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85087795295&doi=10.1109%2fLRA.2020.3003871&partnerID=40&md5=cd5192fb3bf1efd304820b3f8cb9a1ad,IEEE Robotics and Automation Letters,2020
CAN-ADF: The controller area network attack detection framework,"In recent years, there has been significant interest in developing autonomous vehicles such as self-driving cars. In-vehicle communications, due to simplicity and reliability, a Controller Area Network (CAN) bus is widely used as the de facto standard to provide serial communications between Electronic Control Units (ECUs). However, prior research reveals that several network-level attacks can be performed due to the lack of defense mechanisms in the CAN bus. In this work, we propose CAN Bus Message Attack Detection Framework (CAN-ADF) - a comprehensive anomaly generation, detection, and evaluation system for a CAN bus. In CAN-ADF, not only various anomalies and attack characteristics can be configured but also different detection methods, and visualization frameworks are provided to effectively detect those attacks and anomalies. For the detector, we employ both a rule-based approach crafted from dynamic network traffic characteristics and Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN). For evaluation, we use 7,875,791 in-vehicle CAN packets collected from real cars, KIA Soul and Hyundai Sonata. Our detection algorithm achieves accurate intrusion detection performance, with an average accuracy of 99.45% on CAN datasets, outperforming prior approach. Furthermore, we developed a visualization tool to validate the detection of anomalies by CAN-ADF and to find new patterns in the dataset. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85089239061&doi=10.1016%2fj.cose.2020.101857&partnerID=40&md5=eb6c8448807ab58058fb65946847fc06,Computers and Security,2020
Classification of brain MRI using hyper column technique with convolutional neural network and feature selection method,"A proper and certain brain tumor MRI classification has a significant role in current clinical diagnosis, decision making as well as managing the treatment programs. In clinical practice, the examination is performed visually by the specialists, this is a labor-intensive and error-prone process. Therefore, the computer-based systems are in demand so as to carry out objectively this process. In the traditional machine learning approaches, the low-level and high-level handcrafted features used to describe the brain tumor MRI are extracted and classified to overcome the mentioned drawbacks. Considering the recent advances in deep learning, we propose a novel convolutional neural network (CNN) model that is combined with the hypercolumn technique, pretrained AlexNet and VGG-16 networks, recursive feature elimination (RFE), and support vector machine (SVM) in this study. One of the great advantages of the proposed model is that with the help of the hypercolumn technique, it can keep the local discriminative features, which are extracted from the layers located at the different levels of the deep architectures. In addition, the proposed model exploits the generalization abilities of both AlexNet and VGG-16 networks by fusing the deep features achieved from the last fully-connected layers of the networks. Furthermore, the discriminative capacity of the proposed model is enhanced using RFE and thus the most effective deep features are revealed. As a result, the proposed model yielded an accuracy of 96.77% without using any handcrafted feature engine. A fully automated consistent and effective diagnostic model is ensured for the brain tumor MRI classification. Consequently, the proposed model can contribute to realizing a more objective evaluation in the clinics, supporting the decision-making process of the experts, and reducing misdiagnosis rates. © 2020",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85079137030&doi=10.1016%2fj.eswa.2020.113274&partnerID=40&md5=d3817dc1501588980e6962887de80e0a,Expert Systems with Applications,2020
Fuzzy Static Output Feedback Control for Path following of Autonomous Vehicles with Transient Performance Improvements,"This paper provides a new solution for path following control of autonomous ground vehicles. H 2 control problem is considered to attenuate the effect of the road curvature disturbance. To this end, we formulate a standard model from the road-vehicle dynamics, the a priori knowledge on the road curvature, and the path following specifications. This standard model is then represented in a Takagi-Sugeno fuzzy form to deal with the time-varying nature of the vehicle speed. Based on a static output feedback scheme, the proposed method allows avoiding expensive vehicle sensors while keeping the simplest control structure for real-time implementation. The concept of D-stability is exploited using Lyapunov stability arguments to improve the transient behaviors of the closed-loop vehicle system. In particular, the physical upper and lower bounds of the vehicle acceleration are explicitly considered in the design procedure via a parameter-dependent Lyapunov function to reduce drastically the design conservatism. The proposed H2 design conditions are expressed in terms of linear matrix inequalities (LMIs) with a single line search parameter. The effectiveness of the new path following control method is clearly demonstrated with both theoretical illustrations and hardware experiments under real-world driving situations.  © 2000-2011 IEEE.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85087645836&doi=10.1109%2fTITS.2019.2924705&partnerID=40&md5=dc7d15d2089532f07b05e22f1fd1673a,IEEE Transactions on Intelligent Transportation Systems,2020
CANeleon: Protecting CAN Bus with Frame ID Chameleon,"The Controller Area Network (CAN) has been widely used in the automotive and industrial automation for over two decades. However, due to the lack of security mechanisms, CAN is vulnerable to attacks. In this paper, we propose a novel protection scheme called CANeleon. It can defend CAN against a smart attacker who might inject malicious frames with legitimate frame IDs, which cannot be mitigated by existing countermeasures. Inspired by the idea of moving target defense technologies, CANeleon equips each legitimate CAN node with the ability to shift the spoofed frame ID. In this way, the IDs of malicious frames are exposed and can be further filtered by legitimate nodes. Moreover, CANeleon neither inserts new information to the frame, nor requires any modification to the CAN protocol, so it is in compliance with the existing standards. CANeleon is a decentralized mechanism guaranteeing that the protection could be done simultaneously without additional communication. Experiments on a CAN bus prototype and a real self-driving vehicle prove the effectiveness of CANeleon. © 1967-2012 IEEE.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85088697695&doi=10.1109%2fTVT.2020.2990417&partnerID=40&md5=c659b75b748cf5671544a1389c7bcf6f,IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology,2020
Adversarial Examples: Opportunities and Challenges,"Deep neural networks (DNNs) have shown huge superiority over humans in image recognition, speech processing, autonomous vehicles, and medical diagnosis. However, recent studies indicate that DNNs are vulnerable to adversarial examples (AEs), which are designed by attackers to fool deep learning models. Different from real examples, AEs can mislead the model to predict incorrect outputs while hardly be distinguished by human eyes, therefore threaten security-critical deep-learning applications. In recent years, the generation and defense of AEs have become a research hotspot in the field of artificial intelligence (AI) security. This article reviews the latest research progress of AEs. First, we introduce the concept, cause, characteristics, and evaluation metrics of AEs, then give a survey on the state-of-the-art AE generation methods with the discussion of advantages and disadvantages. After that, we review the existing defenses and discuss their limitations. Finally, future research opportunities and challenges on AEs are prospected. © 2012 IEEE.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85088131656&doi=10.1109%2fTNNLS.2019.2933524&partnerID=40&md5=b2e84589d401759f70cc367b544a67d1,IEEE Transactions on Neural Networks and Learning Systems,2020
Synthetic Aperture Sonar Track Registration with Motion Compensation for Coherent Change Detection,"The capability to detect changes in an underwater scene has many applications, including environmental monitoring, surveillance of strategic maritime waterways, and naval mine countermeasures. This paper examines the automated detection of changes in repeat-pass synthetic aperture sonar (SAS) imagery by exploiting the loss of phase coherence caused by differences in the scene. A renavigation method based on track registration is developed for performing the coregistration of images. The method first determines the corrections to be applied to the repeat-pass navigation data by optimizing a linear track model using the estimated across-track pixel displacements. A second optimization is then performed using the along-track pixel displacements to determine a velocity correction for each ping location of the repeat-pass image to compensate for residual motion errors. The corrected navigation solution is then used to rebeamform the repeat-pass image onto the same focal points as the reference image. The method is demonstrated on a pair of repeat-pass SAS images acquired using the AquaPix INSAS2 sonar, where it is shown that it is not necessary to have access to raw element data to coregister images accurately enough for coherent change detection requirements. This technique is then applied to the second data set obtained using the HISAS 1030 sonar for the purpose of comparing both coherent and noncoherent (amplitude-only) approaches to change detection in scenes with low and high clutters. False alarms caused by the acoustic shadows of objects in high-clutter areas are mitigated using the single-pass interferometric coherence as a reference mask. The results show the successful use of the repeat-pass coherence to detect changes between SAS images with temporal baselines of several days on scenes consisting of mud, gravel, and sand, and demonstrate that a coherent approach is capable of detecting large-scale differences (caused by the introduction or removal of targets) as well as subtle scene changes that are not detectable using noncoherent methods. © 1976-2012 IEEE.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85088707349&doi=10.1109%2fJOE.2019.2909960&partnerID=40&md5=5e196ed08e4f65ad0d701abd39ca21e2,IEEE Journal of Oceanic Engineering,2020
Implementing Distributed TDMA Using Relative Distance in Vehicular Networks,"With the advent of self-driving cars, vehicular networking is gaining greater attention and the subject of extensive research. It is important to implement a more efficient and secure transportation system by enabling communication among objects on the road. Specifically, safety applications should be delivered in a reliable manner within a limited time period. Several time division multiple access (TDMA) protocols have been proposed to realize this. However, most of the existing research have proposed slot management approaches by taking into account the static topology; they have not sufficiently discussed research on 'merging collision' arising from overlapping two or more collision domains due to vehicle mobility. In this study, we examine the effect of merging collision in terms of packet delivery ratio, overhead, and inter-basic safety message (inter-BSM) delay.11Delay between BSMs received in succession. To mitigate the effect of merging collision, we also propose a lightweight distributed TDMA protocol, where the order of vehicles on the road and their relative distances are exploited to determine the dedicated slot. The collision is further resolved using in-band signaling from the surrounding vehicles. Simulation studies show that the proposed scheme improves the performance of the packet delivery ratio (PDR) 10% more than the comparative protocol, and consequently achieves 97% and 95% PDRs, in highway and urban environment, respectively. Furthermore, the overhead and inter-BSM delay are substantially reduced. © 1967-2012 IEEE.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85088508166&doi=10.1109%2fTVT.2020.2989524&partnerID=40&md5=cef0a61491be98cb74ae0ecb5281e9c8,IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology,2020
Resilient Output Containment of Heterogeneous Cooperative and Adversarial Multigroup Systems,"This note introduces a new concept of cooperative and adversarial multigroup system, which consists of cooperative leaders and followers, as well as adversaries. For example, cooperation of multiple military vehicles operate in complex dynamic networked environments with unknown enemies and hidden malicious attackers. The lack of global situational awareness in distributed settings makes autonomous vehicles prone to cyberattacks and infiltration. Each agent is unaware of the motives of its neighbors and may receive information/data from both the teammates and the adversaries. Secure and resilient control protocols are essential for the networked multigroup systems to prevent the adversaries' attacks from propagating across the network, which may influence the system performance and even overall stability. To counter sensor faults and attacks from the adversaries, a distributed resilient control architecture is proposed, which guarantees uniform ultimate boundedness of the closed-loop dynamical system. Numerical simulations illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed results. © 1963-2012 IEEE.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85087485820&doi=10.1109%2fTAC.2019.2947620&partnerID=40&md5=758d391682579bb1b529364ae7bb6156,IEEE Transactions on Automatic Control,2020
An Analysis of the Tradeoff between Fuel Consumption and Ride Comfort for the Pulse and Glide Driving Strategy,"Pulse and glide (PnG) is a driving strategy that controls vehicles in a more fuel-efficient way than driving at a constant speed does. It can be applied by the driver or, which is more likely, by an automated system with autonomy level one or higher. During the pulse phase, the vehicle is accelerated to operate the combustion engine and transmission at higher efficiency. During the following glide phase, the vehicle decelerates and the engine is decoupled from the drive train. The optimal pulse and glide strategy-as addressed in previous studies-implies high acceleration values and abrupt transitions between pulse and glide, which both degrade the ride comfort. A driveability study on PnG conducted recently identified that the acceleration, the jerk during the transitions and the duration of the glide phase have to be limited to reach the desired level of ride comfort. Thresholds have been derived for a level-eight calibration, i.e. a PnG operation that is noticeable only to skeptical customers. We use the results of the study to also provide thresholds for a level-seven calibration, i.e. a PnG operation that is noticeable to all customers without being disturbing. Subsequently, we establish a correlation between ride comfort and fuel consumption by comparing the fuel savings of three different driveability calibrations: level eight, level seven and a calibration without driveability constraints. The simulations are performed for a D-segment vehicle and two different gasoline engines. With reference to constant speed, the fuel savings of the level-seven calibration are larger than 30% below 40 km/h, decreasing gradually with increasing speed. They are around ten percent higher than those of the level-eight calibration and only a few percent lower than those of a PnG operation without driveability constraints. Hence, the level-seven calibration can nearly exploit the maximal fuel-saving potential of PnG, and, as it is not disturbing, should be considered for practical applications of PnG. The PnG strategy can be applied to any vehicle equipped with a combustion engine that features the engine-off functionality, which is the case for mild and full hybrids and for some micro hybrids. However, considering that the benefit of PnG increases with increasing engine size, the fuel saving potential of PnG is highest for micro and mild hybrids as these vehicles are commonly equipped with larger engines than full hybrids. © 1967-2012 IEEE.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85088496708&doi=10.1109%2fTVT.2020.2994467&partnerID=40&md5=17048383299b441ae974ac61eb2e33f6,IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology,2020
Bidirectional Prediction-Based Underwater Data Collection Protocol for End-Edge-Cloud Orchestrated System,"The proliferation of advanced underwater technology and the emergence of various cloud services promote the horizon of cloud-based underwater acoustic sensor network (UASN). Sending end data to cloud for analysis is becoming a prominent trend, driving cloud computing as an indispensable computing paradigm. However, UASN bears tremendous burdens with respect to data collection from end to cloud, such as large transmission power consumption and high delay, which makes it difficult to meet the delay-sensitive and context-aware service requirements by using cloud computing alone. To this end, a two-level bidirectional data prediction model for end-edge-cloud orchestration is proposed in this article. The mobility and computing ability of edge elements are exploited to analyze and collect data. Edge elements predict the future data based on historical information and trend to decrease acoustic communication. Moreover, a data collection protocol with mobile edge elements is designed. With this protocol, computing paradigms are shifted from centralized cloud to distributed edge, and the differentiated capability of heterogeneous devices is exploited. After extensive experiments, the results show that the data collection cost is dramatically decreased while the bandwidth utilization is increased, which is critical for underwater acoustic communication. The proposed method and protocol strike a good balance between data accuracy and energy consumption for the new end-edge-cloud orchestrated system. © 2005-2012 IEEE.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85073620393&doi=10.1109%2fTII.2019.2940745&partnerID=40&md5=a472857dbf68c98993b0952b7539fe74,IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics,2020
Output-Feedback Image-Based Visual Servoing for Multirotor Unmanned Aerial Vehicle Line following,"This article considers visual servoing-based motion control of multirotor unmanned aerial vehicles. We employ output feedback and image-based visual servoing to control the vehicle's pose with respect to a static planar visual target with a linear structure (e.g., electric transmission lines or pipelines). The method uses measurements from inexpensive sensors typically found on-board: an inertial measurement unit, and a monocular computer vision system. Unlike existing work, it does not require linear velocity, position measurements, or an optical flow sensor. The method directly controls the relative pose to the visual target and does not require global navigation satellite system measurements of the vehicle or target. The visual servoing method ensures the vehicle flies centered above the lines at specified height and yaw. Such motion control is important in a number of applications such as efficient data collection for infrastructure inspection. Our article exploits the inherent robustness of an image-based approach where feature error is computed directly in the image plane. A virtual camera is combined with output feedback and convergence of the closed loop is proven. The method is adaptive to vehicle mass, thrust constant, desired depth, and a constant disturbance force. Simulation and experimental results illustrate the method's performance and robustness to model uncertainty.  © 1965-2011 IEEE.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85089481424&doi=10.1109%2fTAES.2020.2967851&partnerID=40&md5=cac091c70ae7c27df8a37913585c37db,IEEE Transactions on Aerospace and Electronic Systems,2020
On Wireless Blind Spots in the C-V2X Sidelink,"The third generation partnership project (3GPP) has issued specifications for the autonomous assignment of radio resources by vehicles on the sidelink of the cellular-vehicle-To-everything (C-V2X) technology. It is based on a sensing mechanism for resource selection and a semi-persistent scheduling for resource reservation to periodic safety messages. Imperfect sensing due to hidden terminals and to half-duplex on board transceivers may result in the selection of interfered resources for successive message transmissions. As a consequence of the lost packets, involved vehicles may become blind to the presence of other vehicles in their vicinity even for many seconds, with threats to the road safety. In this paper, we define these events as wireless blind spots (WBSs) and characterize their probability to occur. We propose an enhancement to the autonomous mode in order to reduce the WBS duration and demonstrate the benefits of the proposal against the legacy mode, both analytically in a simplified scenario and through simulations in a highway environment.  © 1967-2012 IEEE.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85090158133&doi=10.1109%2fTVT.2020.3001074&partnerID=40&md5=3d9279f5ce70eaf91de16a4f25787258,IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology,2020
Learning the time-varying massive mimo channels: Robust estimation and data-Aided prediction,"The quasi-static assumption of channels becomes invalid in a number of emerging applications of massive multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) systems with high base station (BS)/user mobility, such as high speed train and unmanned aerial vehicle communications. In these situations, the time variation of channels shortens the channel coherence time and decreases the efficiency of traditional channel estimation schemes significantly. This paper focuses on the time-varying channel estimation problem in massive MIMO systems, where the mobility of BS/user is assumed to be high. The sparse property of the time-varying massive MIMO channels is analyzed, which reveals that the angular domain channels exhibit two kinds of spatial-Temporal sparse (STS) structures, namely the temporal-common sparse structure and spatial-clustered sparse structure. By exploiting the STS structures, a novel structured variational Bayesian inference (VBI) framework is formulated to make a robust channel estimation during the training phase. A data-Aided channel predication scheme is further proposed to combat the time variation of the channels during the data transmission phase without increasing the pilot consumption. The simulation results demonstrate the superiority of the proposed scheme in the time-varying scenarios with different BS/user mobilities. © 1967-2012 IEEE.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85090144461&doi=10.1109%2fTVT.2020.2968637&partnerID=40&md5=937678679103d41261dc777a734cfebf,IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology,2020
Take the Field from Your Smartphone: Leveraging UAVs for Event Filming,"This paper formulates the Sport Event Filming with Connectivity Constraints (SEF-C^22) problem. The SEF-C^22 problem is an event coverage problem, which exploits a team of Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) over a limited field in order to track the movements of an object (e.g., of the ball) and to deliver a video stream of the events (e.g., ball passes, goals) to the spectators meeting certain timeliness and video quality criteria. Assuming a priori knowledge of the whole sequence of actions, first a novel mathematical model is introduced that determines a sequence of movements for the UAVs, such that the timeliness of the filming is maximized and the total traveled distance is minimized. Then, dynamic, artificial potential function based, distributed UAV movement schemes that have no a priori knowledge of the sequence of game actions are proposed to optimize networking performance.

Enabling performance and security simulation studies of intelligent traffic signal light control with VENTOS-HIL,"Vehicular Ad-hoc Network (VANET) simulators have gained widespread adoption in the research community given the fact that they can simulate near real life scenarios to evaluate driver-safety applications without endangering human lives. In this paper, we present the VEhicular NeTwork Open Simulator (VENTOS), a closed-loop VANET simulator that combines the capabilities of both communication network (OMNET++) and vehicular traffic simulators (SUMO). As an alternative to current proprietary VANET simulators, VENTOS is a free, open-source simulator that is designed for vehicular traffic flow analysis and can incorporate new control logic, such as intelligent traffic controller, collaborative driving, dynamic routing, and self-driving capability. VENTOS supports V2X (Vehicle-to-Vehicle or Vehicle-to-Infrastructure) communication through dedicated short-range communication (DSRC) integration. This paper will give an overview of the VENTOS architecture and its extension, VENTOS-HIL, which supports hardware-in-the-loop emulation using physical devices such as On-Board Units (OBUs) or Roadside Units (RSUs). We then demonstrate how VENTOS can be utilized to simulate and evaluate the performance of multi-modal, adaptive traffic signal control (TSC) as well as to illustrate the security vulnerability of intelligent TSC in the presence of falsified data attacks. © 2020 Elsevier Inc.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85078850508&doi=10.1016%2fj.vehcom.2020.100230&partnerID=40&md5=6d824161e256bbae2bf4fb7e078beac3,Vehicular Communications,2020
Opportunistic UAV Navigation with Carrier Phase Measurements from Asynchronous Cellular Signals,"This article presents a framework for opportunistic unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) navigation by exploiting carrier phase measurements from ambient cellular signals of opportunity. In the proposed framework, the cellular base transceiver stations (BTSs) are not assumed to be synchronous. A complete framework that employs an extended Kalman filter (EKF) is presented, including filter initialization and process and measurement noise covariance selection. The EKF estimates the position and velocity of the UAV, as well as the differences between the UAV-mounted receiver and each of the BTSs' clock bias and clock drift. The observability of the estimation framework is analyzed, and the boundedness of the EKF's errors is studied. It is shown that the system is observable given a class of vehicle and receiver clock dynamics. A lower bound for the EKF estimation error covariance is derived, and it is shown that the covariance remains bounded. Monte Carlo simulations are conducted to study the effect of the number of BTSs, the initial UAV speed, and the receiver's oscillator quality, on the estimation performance. Two sets of experimental results are presented demonstrating UAVs navigating exclusively with cellular carrier phase measurements via the developed framework, achieving a total position root-mean-squared error of 2.94 and 5.99 m for UAV trajectories of 2.6 and 2.9 km, respectively.  © 1965-2011 IEEE.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85089532075&doi=10.1109%2fTAES.2019.2948452&partnerID=40&md5=b8f6201f22be6e09f54a1b04533ae4de,IEEE Transactions on Aerospace and Electronic Systems,2020
Online computation offloading and traffic routing for uav swarms in edge-cloud computing,"Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) swarms are widely applied for service provisioning in many domains such as topographic mapping and traffic monitoring. These UAV applications are complicated as they demand not only huge computational resources but also strict latency requirements. However, due to the limited onboard resources of UAVs as well as various dynamics of applications and environments, it's challenging to obtain a feasible computation offloading policy in online environments. To cope with these problems, we propose an online algorithm for UAV swarms to jointly optimize the computation offloading and multi-hop routing scheduling in the Edge-Cloud environment. First, we propose a UAV-Edge-Cloud computing model to meet the requirements of latency and computing capability. We then formulate a joint optimization of workflow assignment and multi-hop routing scheduling in order to minimize the computation cost and latency. To tackle this NP-hard problem, an algorithm based on the Markov approximation technique is designed to obtain near-optimal solutions. Furthermore, to achieve high long-term performance in online environments, we exploit Lyapunov optimization to control the migration cost caused by the dynamics of application and environment. Finally, extensive simulation results demonstrate that our approach achieves a long-term high-efficiency and stable performance in an online environment for UAV swarms with respect to computation offloading and traffic routing. © 1967-2012 IEEE.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85090137858&doi=10.1109%2fTVT.2020.2994541&partnerID=40&md5=7fdfa7166fc869f7b42dfd0367efff12,IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology,2020
Observer-Based Control for Cyber-Physical Systems with Periodic DoS Attacks via a Cyclic Switching Strategy,"This article studies the observer-based output feedback control problem for a class of cyber-physical systems with periodic denial-of-service (DoS) attacks, where the attacks coexist both in the measurement and control channels in the network scenario. The periodic DoS attacks are characterized by a cyclic dwell-time switching strategy, such that the resulting augmented system can be converted into a class of discrete-time cyclic dwell-time switched systems including a stable subsystem and an unstable subsystem. By means of a cyclic piecewise linear Lyapunov function approach, the exponential stability and l2-gain analysis, and observer-based controller design are carried out for the augmented discrete-time cyclic switched system. Then, the desired observer and controller gains in piecewise linear form are determined simultaneously so as to ensure that the resulting closed-loop system is exponentially stable with a prescribed H∞ performance index. Finally, a practical application of unmanned ground vehicles under periodic DoS attacks is provided to verify the effectiveness of the developed control approach.  © 1963-2012 IEEE.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85077942870&doi=10.1109%2fTAC.2019.2953210&partnerID=40&md5=b39c5a0a3e3a3275affd14c5a0ad73f0,IEEE Transactions on Automatic Control,2020
Ground Moving Vehicle Detection and Movement Tracking Based on the Neuromorphic Vision Sensor,"Moving-objects detection is a critical ability for an autonomous vehicle. Facing the high detection requirements and the slow target-extraction problem of a common camera, this article proposes to utilize neuromorphic vision sensor (DVS) for detecting the moving objects and estimating their movement states. For a better detection work, the DVS image's noise points are filtered and the CTRV kinematics model is built in advance. In order to distinguish the overlapped or nearby bodies and get the accurate clustering number, this article proposes a 3-D improved $K$ -means method. As the clustering centers can be influenced by the movement easily, the moving objects' clustering centers appear unstable, so the movement estimation also fluctuates. In order to obtain stable movement estimation, this article proposes a strong tracking center differential external Kalman filter (SCDEKF) to track the moving objects, and the method has higher accuracy and less computational load. In order to verify the advantages of proposed methods, a simulation environment was established in the Gazebo, and the common cameras were also added in simulation for comparison with the DVS sensor. The simulation results show that the 3-D improved $K$ -means method with DVS can cluster the moving objects accurately, and the SCDEKF can provide more accurate movement estimation than the traditional EKF method. Finally, two experiments were conducted to prove the methods' superiority. The main contribution is to solve the exploitation problems faced by the short-term borne sensor and promote its application in transportation.  © 2014 IEEE.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85092186275&doi=10.1109%2fJIOT.2020.3001167&partnerID=40&md5=c8b870a3fc39eebfd13fed6934e7c557,IEEE Internet of Things Journal,2020
Behavioral Biometrics for Continuous Authentication in the Internet-of-Things Era: An Artificial Intelligence Perspective,"In the Internet-of-Things (IoT) era, user authentication is essential to ensure the security of connected devices and the customization of passive services. However, conventional knowledge-based and physiological biometric-based authentication systems (e.g., password, face recognition, and fingerprints) are susceptible to shoulder surfing attacks, smudge attacks, and heat attacks. The powerful sensing capabilities of IoT devices, including smartphones, wearables, robots, and autonomous vehicles enable continuous authentication (CA) based on behavioral biometrics. The artificial intelligence (AI) approaches hold significant promise in sifting through large volumes of heterogeneous biometrics data to offer unprecedented user authentication and user identification capabilities. In this survey article, we outline the nature of CA in IoT applications, highlight the key behavioral signals, and summarize the extant solutions from an AI perspective. Based on our systematic and comprehensive analysis, we discuss the challenges and promising future directions to guide the next generation of AI-based CA research.  © 2014 IEEE.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85092196283&doi=10.1109%2fJIOT.2020.3004077&partnerID=40&md5=bcc94c53dfb87bc92fe386c0ed2943bd,IEEE Internet of Things Journal,2020
Adversarial Learning and Self-Teaching Techniques for Domain Adaptation in Semantic Segmentation,"Deep learning techniques have been widely used in autonomous driving systems for the semantic understanding of urban scenes. However, they need a huge amount of labeled data for training, which is difficult and expensive to acquire. A recently proposed workaround is to train deep networks using synthetic data, but the domain shift between real world and synthetic representations limits the performance. In this work, a novel Unsupervised Domain Adaptation (UDA) strategy is introduced to solve this issue. The proposed learning strategy is driven by three components: a standard supervised learning loss on labeled synthetic data; an adversarial learning module that exploits both labeled synthetic data and unlabeled real data; finally, a self-teaching strategy applied to unlabeled data. The last component exploits a region growing framework guided by the segmentation confidence. Furthermore, we weighted this component on the basis of the class frequencies to enhance the performance on less common classes. Experimental results prove the effectiveness of the proposed strategy in adapting a segmentation network trained on synthetic datasets, like GTA5 and SYNTHIA, to real world datasets like Cityscapes and Mapillary.  © 2016 IEEE.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85089768118&doi=10.1109%2fTIV.2020.2980671&partnerID=40&md5=2c2bfc61a7270515300604ffee67b79d,IEEE Transactions on Intelligent Vehicles,2020
Graph-Based File Dispatching Protocol with D2D-Enhanced UAV-NOMA Communications in Large-Scale Networks,"As a newly emerging communication assistant equipment, unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) can be exploited to dispatch data files quickly to specific areas and support rapid deployment of communication links in complex terrain, which is of great significance for specific communication demands in disaster and remote areas. Nonorthogonal multiple access (NOMA), as a rosy technology in the fifth generation (5G) and future mobile communication systems, has been widely studied because of its ability in improving spectral efficiency and reducing transmission latency to enhance the overall Quality of Service (QoS) and meet the strict communication requirements. Based on these, in this article, we propose a device-to-device (D2D)-enhanced UAV-NOMA network architecture, in which D2D is introduced to increase the file dispatching efficiency. In our proposed D2D-enhanced UAV-NOMA network, the ground users (GUEs) that have already received file blocks (FBs) are allowed to reuse the time-frequency resources assigned to NOMA links to share their FBs with other GUEs, which significantly improves the efficiency of file dispatching. But this also leads to a complicated interference environment. In order to effectively manage the interference and minimize the UAV-assisted file dispatching mission time, we propose a graph-based file dispatching (GFD) protocol, in which the complicated joint optimization problem is decomposed to be solved efficiently and graph theory-based algorithms are proposed for resource allocation. The simulation results verify the advantages of our proposed D2D-enhanced UAV-NOMA network architecture and the efficiency of our designed GFD protocol in minimizing the total UAV-assisted file dispatching mission time.  © 2014 IEEE.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85088709465&doi=10.1109%2fJIOT.2020.2994549&partnerID=40&md5=331849b9f9b927f4d76462aca7d1b11b,IEEE Internet of Things Journal,2020
Decentralized fractional-order backstepping fault-tolerant control of multi-UAVs against actuator faults and wind effects,"Concurrent occurrences of actuator faults and wind effects can significantly threaten the flight safety of multiple unmanned aerial vehicles (multi-UAVs). To address this difficult control problem against actuator faults and wind effects, a composite decentralized fractional-order (FO) backstepping adaptive neural fault-tolerant control (FTC) method is presented for the attitude synchronization tracking of multi-UAVs, which is integrated with neural networks (NNs), disturbance observers (DOs), FO calculus, and high-order sliding-mode differentiators (HOSMDs). The distinctive feature of this work is addressing the attitude synchronization tracking control problem with actuator faults and wind effects in a decentralized framework and proposing a composite approximation method for multi-UAVs. It is shown that by using Lyapunov methods the synchronization tracking control is achieved even when multi-UAVs simultaneously encounter wind effects and actuator faults. Comparative simulation results illustrate the theoretical feasibility. © 2020 Elsevier Masson SAS",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85086565715&doi=10.1016%2fj.ast.2020.105939&partnerID=40&md5=5c97035451022c870492f7f0447a99f2,Aerospace Science and Technology,2020
Enhancing Misbehavior Detection in 5G Vehicle-to-Vehicle Communications,"Next-generation advanced driver-assistance systems (ADAS) and cooperative adaptive cruise control (CACC) for advanced/autonomous driving are expected to increasingly use wireless connectivity such as V2V and V2I to improve the coverage, particularly in the locations where a vehicle's camera or radar is ineffective. However, using shared sensing data raises grave concerns about the truthfulness of information reported by unreliable stakeholders. For example, a transmitting vehicle may deliberately disseminate false locations to the surrounding receivers. Trusting the data, the automatic control systems in such connected receivers can be trapped to change to a wrong lane or accelerate unexpectedly, and then potentially lead to a crash. This work introduces a novel approach to support a host vehicle in verifying the motion behavior of a target vehicle and then the truthfulness of sharing data in cooperative vehicular communications. Initially, at the host vehicle, the detection system recreates the motion behavior of the target vehicle by extracting the positioning information from the V2V received messages. Furthermore, the next states of that vehicle are predicted based on the unscented Kalman filter. Unlike prior studies, the checkpoints of the predicted trajectory in the update stage are periodically corrected with a new reliable measurement source, namely 5 G V2V multi-array beamforming localization. If there is any inconsistency between the estimated position and the corresponding reported one from V2V, the target vehicle will be classified as an abnormal one. The simulation results demonstrate that our method can achieve accuracy over 0.97 in detecting abnormal reports, including those from collusion and Sybil attacks.  © 1967-2012 IEEE.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85089831557&doi=10.1109%2fTVT.2020.2975822&partnerID=40&md5=d4f7e5075f2a6a4935070bcf71db3378,IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology,2020
Protecting an Autonomous Delivery Agent against a Vision-Guided Adversary: Algorithms and Experimental Results,"Safety considerations call for deployment of autonomous ground vehicles in defense and high risk zones for transport of goods from one point to another. Such vehicles face the threat of an intelligent autonomous adversary that may disrupt the transfer of material. This article investigates the challenges involved in autonomous protection of a delivery agent, via a land-based rescue agent, before interception of the delivery agent by the adversary occurs. In particular, we study how effectively an adversary equipped with a vision sensor can be handled by an autonomous rescue agent operating without vision support and relying only on wireless communication with the delivery agent. Taking capabilities and weights of the three vehicles into account, the delivery agent is assumed to be the slowest while the adversary operates at the highest speed among the three vehicles. A geometric framework based on Apollonius circles is proposed to analyze the interaction between the delivery and rescue agents. The adversary's speed and its moves (based on the direction of the delivery agent) are taken into account, along with the Apollonius circles for the rescue-delivery agent pair, to determine the possibility of capture. Regions in the plane where the delivery and rescue agents can meet, prior to a capture by the adversary, are obtained to compute safe regions for the delivery agent. Algorithms adopted by the delivery agent, rescue agent, and the adversary are described. We, then, explore the challenges in rescue of multiple delivery agents from a vision-guided adversary by introducing additional rescue agents. In particular, we study protection of k delivery agents (from an adversary) via k rescue agents. Algorithms to compute 1) multiple meeting points, one each for a delivery agent-rescue agent pair and 2) the strategy of the adversary to capture any one of the k delivery agents are presented. Experiments with multiple agents show that the delivery and rescue agents can execute their strategies using simply low-end microcontrollers without external memory. © 2005-2012 IEEE.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85086068347&doi=10.1109%2fTII.2019.2958818&partnerID=40&md5=87d75e1b5e39a11f7a967c79178a49d9,IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics,2020
Optimal Stealthy Deception Attack against Cyber-Physical Systems,"This paper studies the problem of designing the optimal deception attack to maximize a utility function with the Kullback-Leibler divergence adopted as a detection constraint. The utility function reflects the goal of pulling the state away from the origin, increasing the cost of the controller and decreasing the cost of the attacker. To analyze the stealthiness of the attack, the attack signal is decomposed into two parts, one of which is strict stealthy. The necessary and sufficient condition is derived for the case that the strict stealthy attack cannot lead to an unbounded benefit. In this case, the linear transformation of the optimal attack is proved to be a Gaussian distribution. With the mean value and covariance of the Gaussian distribution as variables, the original problem is transformed into a new problem which may not be convex. A suboptimal attack policy is provided and the upper bound for the loss of benefit when using the suboptimal attack is also given. A numerical example of unmanned ground vehicle is illustrated to verify the effectiveness of the proposed attack policy. © 2013 IEEE.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85089712881&doi=10.1109%2fTCYB.2019.2912622&partnerID=40&md5=3b07b84137d1cb4fe7075913c60828e1,IEEE Transactions on Cybernetics,2020
A Trust-Based Team Formation Framework for Mobile Intelligence in Smart Factories,"In Smart Factories, automated guided vehicles (AGVs) accomplish heterogeneous tasks as moving objects, restoring connectivity, or performing different manufacturing activities into production lines. These kinds of devices combine several capabilities, as artificial intelligence (visual and speech recognition, automatic fault detecting, proactive behavior) and mobility, into the so-called 'mobile intelligence.' A typical scenario is represented by a workshop with a large number of mobile intelligent devices with associated agents, mutually interacting on their behalf. Here, to reach a given target by contemporary satisfying some basic requirements like effectiveness and efficiency, it is often necessary to organize ad hoc teams of free-moving vehicles, sensors, and smart devices. Therefore, a specific issue is the adequate representation of the reciprocal agent/device trustworthiness for advantaging such team formation processes within a smart factory environment. To this end, in this article, first, we define a trust measure based on reliability and reputation of AGVs, which are computed based on the feedbacks released for the AGVs activities in the factory; second, we design a trust framework exploiting the defined measures to support the formation of virtual, temporary, and trust-based teams of mobile intelligent devices; and third, we present a set of experimental results highlighting that the proposed trust framework can improve the workshop performance in terms of effectiveness and efficiency. © 2005-2012 IEEE.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85083649512&doi=10.1109%2fTII.2020.2963910&partnerID=40&md5=1116c852e8e0cf4e66e273db8bb36403,IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics,2020
Computation and Sensor Offloading for Cloud-Based Infrastructure-Assisted Autonomous Vehicles,"Existing autonomous vehicles use a myriad of onboard sensors to detect objects and survey environment. Among these sensors, LiDAR is probably the most critical and a high-end LiDAR can cost several tens of thousands USD. High cost of sensors can be a formidable barrier to the proliferation of autonomous vehicles. This article proposes the idea of installing LiDAR sensors on roadside lamp posts for sharing among passing vehicles. This can avoid installing expensive sensors onboard each vehicle. Due to limited computation resources at lamp posts, the task of processing sensor data into environment maps for broadcast to vehicles are performed at edge-cloud servers. This article develops a scheme to identify which edge-cloud servers to host the virtual machines for which lamp posts, so that the total computation and communication cost can be minimized. The proposed scheme exploits reuse of existing data at servers for lower cost. The scheme is formulated as a mixed integer program, which is NP-hard. Therefore, we further propose an iterative algorithm with LP-relaxation to find good approximate solutions to the optimization. Extensive evaluation results confirm the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm. As an example, for a system with 50 lamp posts, the proposed algorithm can find solutions in less than 5 s while solving the original optimization using exhaustive search takes more than 24 h. © 2007-2012 IEEE.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85087496326&doi=10.1109%2fJSYST.2019.2959703&partnerID=40&md5=b621f9485581a8d42391b61ee8cb34a5,IEEE Systems Journal,2020
Unified Biometric Privacy Preserving Three-Factor Authentication and Key Agreement for Cloud-Assisted Autonomous Vehicles,"Autonomous vehicles (AVs) are increasingly common, although there remain a number of limitations that need to be addressed in order for their deployment to be more widespread. For example, to mitigate the failure of self-driving functions in AVs, introducing the remote control capability (which allows a human driver to operate the vehicle remotely in certain circumferences) is one of several countermeasures proposed. However, the remote control capability breaks the isolation of onboard driving systems and can be potentially exploited by malicious actors to take over control of the AVs; thus, risking the safety of the passengers and pedestrians (e.g., AVs are remotely taken over by terrorist groups to carry out coordinated attacks in places of mass gatherings). Therefore, security is a key, mandatory feature in the design of AVs. In this paper, we propose a cloud-centric three-factor authentication and key agreement protocol (CT-AKA) integrating passwords, biometrics and smart cards to ensure secure access to both cloud and AVs. Three typical biometric encryption approaches, including fuzzy vault, fuzzy commitment, and fuzzy extractor, are unified to achieve three-factor authentication without leaking the biometric privacy of users. Moreover, two session keys are negotiated in our protocol, namely: one between the user and AV to support secure remote control of the AV, and the other is negotiated between the mobile device and the cloud to introduce resilience to the compromise of ephemeral security parameters to ensure cloud data access security with a high security guarantee. Finally, we formally verify the security properties and evaluate the efficiency of CT-AKA, whose findings demonstrate that the protocol achieves high security strength with reasonable computation and communication costs.  © 1967-2012 IEEE.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85085552369&doi=10.1109%2fTVT.2020.2971254&partnerID=40&md5=f4ac259b65e63c0275bce5875bcfa5ee,IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology,2020
Curb Detection and Tracking in Low-Resolution 3D Point Clouds Based on Optimization Framework,"Curb detection and tracking is an essential component of autonomous vehicle operation in urban environments. Detecting curbs is a particularly challenging task in urban environments that contain countless dynamic objects. Previous studies have approached curb detection using different types of sensor such as cameras, radar, and LIDAR. Among these, LIDAR sensors have superior advantages in regard to detecting curbs because of their robustness in different weather conditions and they can provide accurate distance measurements. Previous methods based on LIDAR have exploited high-resolution 3D point clouds using high-cost LIDARs. However, the processing of large volumes of information is inefficient for autonomous driving technologies because of real time constraints. This paper presents a novel real-time curb detection and tracking algorithm that makes use of a low-resolution LIDAR. The proposed method consists of three steps. First is the extraction of curb candidates based on Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and Density-Based Spatial Clustering of Applications with Noise (DBSCAN). Second is the selection of the optimal candidate using an optimization framework. Lastly is the tracking of the detected curbs. In the tracking module, we use a combination of spatial consistency and validation gate to track the curb in the occlusion region with dynamic objects. Experiments on a public dataset show that the proposed method achieved 91.54% and 89.76% F_{1} score on the straight and curved road while running at about 18 ms per frame, thereby outperforming the state-of-the-art by a large margin. In addition, we integrated the proposed method with the localization module of our autonomous driving platform. The localization module integrated with the proposed method reduces the positional and lateral root mean square (RMS) error of the vehicle localization by 3.58% and 6.68% respectively. In addition, we compare this method with a deep neural network based method from the perspective of a safety-critical system such as self-driving cars. © 2000-2011 IEEE.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85090425811&doi=10.1109%2fTITS.2019.2938498&partnerID=40&md5=ffbd7768efdda39e0b9e50f280457090,IEEE Transactions on Intelligent Transportation Systems,2020
Cabin and battery thermal management of connected and automated hevs for improved energy efficiency using hierarchical model predictive control,"Incorporating traffic information in power management optimization process for electrified and connected vehicles offers opportunities for improving fuel economy. Integrating the management of thermal load (such as those used for heating, ventilation, & air conditioning (HVAC) of the passenger compartment, and for the battery cooling) with the power management process can provide even greater benefits for connected and automated vehicles (CAVs). However, given the relatively slow dynamics associated with the thermal subsystems, the lack of reliable power and thermal loads prediction over an extended prediction horizon is the main challenge for efficient thermal management using model predictive control (MPC). This paper presents a hierarchical two-layer MPC scheme which exploits vehicle speed and traffic preview predictions over short and long prediction horizons to schedule optimal thermal trajectories for the cabin and battery cooling in hybrid electric vehicles (HEVs) via a novel intelligent online constraint handling (IOCH) approach. These trajectories are next incorporated into the vehicle-level controller to determine the proper power split between electric motor and internal combustion engine (ICE). We present the development and experimental validation of control-oriented models used for prediction of the vehicle thermal dynamics and loads over a long planning horizon. Compared to a more traditional single-layer MPC approach, the proposed two-layer MPC shows that depending on the driving cycle and traffic conditions, 2.2% to 5.3% reductions in HEV fuel consumption can be achieved for urban driving and congested city driving cycles, respectively, in CAV operation scenario. This fuel economy improvement is a direct result of taking proactive actions through real-time prediction and optimization to avoid conservative and inefficient thermal responses, while enforcing cabin and battery operating constraints. © 1993-2012 IEEE.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85085974085&doi=10.1109%2fTCST.2019.2923792&partnerID=40&md5=b2ecd981160ee026364a6b0b28e9239f,IEEE Transactions on Control Systems Technology,2020
"Joint Trajectory Design, Tx Power Allocation, and Rx Power Splitting for UAV-Enabled Multicasting SWIPT Systems","This article studies a joint resource allocation for an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) enabled simultaneous wireless information and power transfer (SWIPT) system in a multicasting scenario, where a UAV is dispatched to simultaneously send common information and wireless power to multiple users on the ground while the users decode information and harvest energy based on the power splitting (PS) receiver architecture. In this system, we aim to maximize the minimum achievable rate among all users under their harvested energy constraints by optimizing trajectory and transmit power of the UAV jointly with PS ratios of the users. To solve this challenging nonconvex problem, we first convert it into a more tractable form by exploiting the quadratic transform technique. Then, we propose an efficient iterative algorithm for the joint optimization.

Path Planning under Malicious Injections and Removals of Perceived Obstacles: A Probabilistic Programming Approach,"An autonomous mobile robot may encounter adversarial environments in which an attacker tries to influence its decisions. Through physical or software-level attacks, some of the robot's sensors might be compromised - a special concern for self-driving vehicles. Motivated by this scenario, this letter introduces and studies the problem of planning kinematically feasible (and possibly efficient) paths with bounded collision probability in adversarial settings where the obstacles perceived online by the robot display two layers of uncertainty. The first is the 'usual' Gaussian uncertainty one would obtain from a standard object tracker (e.g., an Extended Kalman Filter); the second is an additional layer of uncertainty that captures possible sensor attacks and describes the actual existence of groups of obstacles in the environment. We study the complexity of the problem and propose a general sampling-based solution framework that uses the Sequential Probability Ratio Test (SPRT) to check collision probability constraints along the computed trajectory. We also show how probabilistic programming languages (PPLs) can simplify programming common algorithms (such as RRT and Hybrid A*) for mixed uncertainty. In addition to providing an easy-to-use programming framework, our approach is shown to plan safer paths compared to a Naive Monte Carlo baseline when both approaches are allowed to use at most the same given number of samples to perform collision checks. © 2016 IEEE.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85091888477&doi=10.1109%2fLRA.2020.3021382&partnerID=40&md5=0bf1123cba783038b29c40995bc3b8b0,IEEE Robotics and Automation Letters,2020
An artificially weighted spanning tree coverage algorithm for decentralized flying robots,"In this article, an artificially weighted spanning tree coverage (AWSTC) algorithm is proposed for the distributed path planning of multiple flying robots. To balance well the efficiency, redundancy, and robustness in the cooperative coverage problem, each robot simultaneously constructs its spanning tree, which grows toward the center of inertia of the uncovered area and keeps away from the trees of its partners. Based on this, each robot covers a concerned area with almost equal trajectory length and computational burden. To guarantee dynamical consistency, a trajectory-smoothing method is developed utilizing Bézier curve transition. As transition in the spanning tree path planning is always conducted around the corner with right angle, geometric and velocity profiles of this kind of transition can be preevaluated as a basic component and then connected to establish more complex real-time trajectories according to the constructed spanning trees. Numerical evaluations and real-time flight experiments are carried out at last. Results demonstrate that the proposed strategy can generate a smooth trajectory for an area coverage problem while ensuring efficiency and robustness. In particular, the efficiency of the proposed algorithm is quite close to the typical centralized spanning tree coverage (STC) algorithm, while ensuring the fulfillment of the coverage task regardless of any breakdown in the individual robot. Note to Practitioners - In applications such as infrastructure inspection and plant protection, the concerned area or terrain is required to be fully covered with the smallest possible time consumption. In view of these real-world requirements, multiple unmanned systems with proper path planning provide a promising solution that can significantly enhance the efficiency as well as the robustness, compared with a single-robot system. Especially, centralized STC algorithms, concerning the computation efficiency and trajectory redundancy of multiple unmanned systems, demonstrate satisfactory effectiveness, and thereby receive a lot of attention. Unfortunately, most of the STC algorithms are proposed in a centralized control framework. Therefore, it is worth to study its decentralized version that could exploit the advantages of the distributed multiple robots. With this consideration, a decentralized AWSTC algorithm is proposed in this article. This spanning tree-based strategy artificially assigns priority weight for each cell, with respect to each individual robot, in the concerned area. With specially designed weight assignment, each robot tends to construct a spanning tree with cells that are uncovered but keep away from the trees of its partners. Based on this, the task burden as well as computational cost of each robot are almost equal. To improve the real-time performance, a Bézier transition trajectory-generation method is also used. With proper parameter selection, robots can generate smooth trajectory with constant velocity in real-time missions. Numerical evaluations and experiments with real-time flight demonstrate the effectiveness of this methodology. © 2004-2012 IEEE.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85092562172&doi=10.1109%2fTASE.2020.2971324&partnerID=40&md5=9c813a4db152476fd036dc54fa3962f5,IEEE Transactions on Automation Science and Engineering,2020
Gaussian Process Online Learning with a Sparse Data Stream,"Gaussian processes (GPs) have been exploited for various applications even including online learning. To learn time-varying hyperparameters from an information-limited sparse data stream, we consider the infinite-horizon Gaussian process (IHGP) with a low computational complexity. For example, the IHGP framework could provide efficient GP online learning with a sparse data stream in mobile devices. However, we show that the originally proposed IHGP has difficulty in learning time-varying hyperparameters online from the sparse data stream due to the numerically approximated gradient of the marginal likelihood function. In this paper, we show how to extend the IHGP in order to learn time-varying hyperparameters using a sparse and non-stationary data stream. In particular, our solution approach offers the exact gradient as the solution of a Lyapunov equation. Therefore, our approach achieves better performance with a sparse data stream while still keeping the computational complexity low. Finally, we present the comparison results to demonstrate that our approach outperforms the originally proposed IHGP on practical applications with sparse data streams. To demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach, we consider a multi-rate sensor fusion or an interpolation problem where slow vision systems need to be combined with other fast sensory units for feedback control in the field of autonomous driving. In particular, we apply our approach to vehicle lateral position error estimation together with a deep learning model for autonomous driving using non-stationary lateral position error signals in a model-free and data-driven fashion. © 2016 IEEE.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85089306443&doi=10.1109%2fLRA.2020.3010752&partnerID=40&md5=9cb952bbb8da7d19e5f45da624256aba,IEEE Robotics and Automation Letters,2020
VeRA: A Simplified Security Risk Analysis Method for Autonomous Vehicles,"Risk analysis/assessment is an indispensable process during the design and development of Autonomous Vehicles (AVs), which is in charge of evaluating whether the risk of an attack is critical or minor. However, current risk analysis methods either are time-consuming or not suitable for Connected and Autonomous Vehicles (CAVs). In this paper, an efficient security risk analysis method, Vehicles Risk Analysis (VeRA), is proposed, fitting for evaluating the risks of attacks in the context of AV and CAVs. VeRA firstly considers the human capabilities and vehicle automation level to conduct a security risk analysis. Meanwhile, compared to the benchmark (i.e., SAE J3061), VeRA uses a simplified analysis process and fewer factors, significantly reducing the required analysis time without affecting analysis accuracy. Moreover, based on VeRA, a simple but efficient mathematical model is established to assess the risk value by considering the attack probability, severity and human control, avoiding the tedious process of looking up tables in previous methods. A case study on a general AV model shows that VeRA not only captures the critical attacks as accurate as other methods, but also analyzes the changes of human controllability with the vehicle's automation level. The performance compared to other available methods shows that VeRA can obtain the same analysis results by using around 43\% less time than the benchmark. © 1967-2012 IEEE.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85095688625&doi=10.1109%2fTVT.2020.3009165&partnerID=40&md5=949e18ae3c62df35136aa2228c27da4e,IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology,2020
A secure road traffic congestion detection and notification concept based on V2I communications,"Applying vehicular (V2X) communications in detecting traffic congestion is a promising approach, as smart and self-driving vehicles are equipped with sensors that can be used to detect an incident anywhere in real-time. Unfortunately, without appropriate security measures and careful design the communication can be vulnerable to malicious attacks, causing even more damage on the roads. Addressing these problems, we propose a high-level system architecture and a security protocol specifically designed for congestion detection based on vehicle-to-infrastructure (V2I) type communication. The security properties of our proposed approach are formally verified using the ProVerif tool, and its efficiency compared to the traditional traffic light systems is demonstrated through simulations with the Veins framework. Results show that our system is secure against a large set of attacks, and can have lower total travelling time compared to three traditional traffic light approaches based on induction loop, lane area detector/camera (installed near the junctions), and static lights. © 2020 Elsevier Inc.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85089524692&doi=10.1016%2fj.vehcom.2020.100283&partnerID=40&md5=e1c18d5bc5b2c6dca48308c97eeb86d9,Vehicular Communications,2020
Probabilistic Crowd GAN: Multimodal Pedestrian Trajectory Prediction Using a Graph Vehicle-Pedestrian Attention Network,"Understanding and predicting the intention of pedestrians is essential to enable autonomous vehicles and mobile robots to navigate crowds. This problem becomes increasingly complex when we consider the uncertainty and multimodality of pedestrian motion, as well as the implicit interactions between members of a crowd, including any response to a vehicle. Our approach, Probabilistic Crowd GAN, extends recent work in trajectory prediction, combining Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) with Mixture Density Networks (MDNs) to output probabilistic multimodal predictions, from which likely modal paths are found and used for adversarial training. We also propose the use of Graph Vehicle-Pedestrian Attention Network (GVAT), which models social interactions and allows input of a shared vehicle feature, showing that inclusion of this module leads to improved trajectory prediction both with and without the presence of a vehicle. Through evaluation on various datasets, we demonstrate improvements on the existing state of the art methods for trajectory prediction and illustrate how the true multimodal and uncertain nature of crowd interactions can be directly modelled.  © 2016 IEEE.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85088145256&doi=10.1109%2fLRA.2020.3004324&partnerID=40&md5=288058ca6bc7edb2bde9dac3a7bc2bf2,IEEE Robotics and Automation Letters,2020
Model-based path prediction for fixed-wing unmanned aircraft using pose estimates,"With the rapid proliferation of small unmanned aircraft systems (sUAS), there is an increasing need for these aircraft to detect and predict each other's motion in order to avoid collisions. This concern arises in addition to the well-established need to detect and avoid manned aircraft. The two threats pose distinct challenges. For example, while a manned aircraft typically travels quite fast compared with a sUAS, its path can be accurately predicted over moderate time intervals using only position measurements and a kinematic particle model. Because sUAS are more maneuverable, and detection horizons can be much shorter, there is a need for more sophisticated prediction methods. One way to improve accuracy is to base predictions on the complete pose (position and attitude) and a higher fidelity model of the threat aircraft's dynamics. As an initial demonstration, we propose an algorithm to predict the path of a small, fixed-wing unmanned aircraft using estimates of this threat aircraft's pose, as might be obtained using visual sensors. To assess the algorithm's performance, predictions using the proposed algorithm are compared with predictions based solely on position data for a large experimental data set. The results indicate that the proposed algorithm outperforms the position-only prediction method. © 2020 Elsevier Masson SAS",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85087282115&doi=10.1016%2fj.ast.2020.106030&partnerID=40&md5=6750b23e95d4a0544e9c53eb141da101,Aerospace Science and Technology,2020
Towards a PDE-based large-scale decentralized solution for path planning of UAVs in shared airspace,"Recently, there has been a tremendous increase of interest in utilizing Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) for a number of civilian applications. With this increased interest, it is imperative that these UAVs are able to operate in shared airspace for enhanced efficiency. Multi-UAV systems are inherently safety-critical systems, which means that safety guarantees must be made to ensure no undesirable configurations, such as collisions, occur. This paper proposes a decentralized method based on a Partial Differential Equation (PDE) to generate collision-free 3D trajectories for multiple UAVs operating in a shared airspace. This method exploits the dynamical properties of multi-phase fluids flowing through a porous medium by modeling the porosity values as a function of the risk of collision. To highlight the feasibility for on-board implementation, we propose propose a machine learning technique for obtaining computationally efficient solutions of the PDE describing flow movements in porous medium. This method has been compared via a simulation study to two other path planning strategies, centralized and sequential planning, and the advantages of this method are presented. Furthermore, results from an experiment using three UAVs have been presented to demonstrate the applicability of the proposed method to real-world implementation. © 2020 Elsevier Masson SAS",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85086828428&doi=10.1016%2fj.ast.2020.105965&partnerID=40&md5=cea50028479972bc24f3afb3b8048735,Aerospace Science and Technology,2020
A Novel Method for Protecting Swimmers and Surfers from Shark Attacks Using Communicating Autonomous Drones,"Shark attacks can make beach tourists anxious about sharing the ocean with apex predators. Although the raw number of shark attacks is deficient, the absolute terror caused by sharks is genuine. This article introduces a novel method named as the 'drone shark shield system,' which uses communicating autonomous drones to intervene and prevent shark attacks for protecting swimmers and surfers. We detail the design of the drone shark shield system and the strategy for repelling sharks through multiple intersections. A shark interception algorithm is developed to guide drones to predicted intersection points for deterring sharks.

DiversityGAN: Diversity-Aware Vehicle Motion Prediction via Latent Semantic Sampling,"Vehicle trajectory prediction is crucial for autonomous driving and advanced driver assistant systems. While existing approaches may sample from a predicted distribution of vehicle trajectories, they lack the ability to explore it-a key ability for evaluating safety from a planning and verification perspective. In this work, we devise a novel approach for generating realistic and diverse vehicle trajectories. We first extend the generative adversarial network (GAN) framework with a low-dimensional approximate semantic space, and shape that space to capture semantics such as merging and turning. We then sample from this space in a way that mimics the predicted distribution, but allows us to control coverage of semantically distinct outcomes. We validate our approach on a publicly available dataset and show results that achieve state-of-the-art prediction performance, while providing improved coverage of the space of predicted trajectory semantics.  © 2016 IEEE.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85088027526&doi=10.1109%2fLRA.2020.3005369&partnerID=40&md5=976891dede6f5b3b594e86ba0833d942,IEEE Robotics and Automation Letters,2020
Don't Forget the Past: Recurrent Depth Estimation from Monocular Video,"Autonomous cars need continuously updated depth information. Thus far, depth is mostly estimated independently for a single frame at a time, even if the method starts from video input. Our method produces a time series of depth maps, which makes it an ideal candidate for online learning approaches. In particular, we put three different types of depth estimation (supervised depth prediction, self-supervised depth prediction, and self-supervised depth completion) into a common framework. We integrate the corresponding networks with a ConvLSTM such that the spatiotemporal structures of depth across frames can be exploited to yield a more accurate depth estimation. Our method is flexible. It can be applied to monocular videos only or be combined with different types of sparse depth patterns. We carefully study the architecture of the recurrent network and its training strategy. We are first to successfully exploit recurrent networks for real-Time self-supervised monocular depth estimation and completion. Extensive experiments show that our recurrent method outperforms its image-based counterpart consistently and significantly in both self-supervised scenarios. It also outperforms previous depth estimation methods of the three popular groups.

Real-Time fusion network for rgb-d sementic segmentation incorporating unexpected obstacle detection,"Semantic segmentation has made striking progress due to the success of deep convolutional neural networks. Considering the demands of autonomous driving, real-Time semantic segmentation has become a research hotspot these years. However, few real-Time RGB-D fusion semantic segmentation studies are carried out despite readily accessible depth information nowadays. In this letter, we propose a real-Time fusion semantic segmentation network termed RFNet that effectively exploits complementary cross-modal information. Building on an efficient network architecture, RFNet is capable of running swiftly, which satisfies autonomous vehicles applications. Multi-dataset training is leveraged to incorporate unexpected small obstacle detection, enriching the recognizable classes required to face unforeseen hazards in the real world. A comprehensive set of experiments demonstrates the effectiveness of our framework. On Cityscapes, Our method outperforms previous state-of-The-Art semantic segmenters, with excellent accuracy and 22 Hz inference speed at the full 2048 × 1024 resolution, outperforming most existing RGB-D networks.  © 2016 IEEE.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85090273581&doi=10.1109%2fLRA.2020.3007457&partnerID=40&md5=3518b23555368fbe014ae4fa8b612a0c,IEEE Robotics and Automation Letters,2020
Robust fault-tolerant control for underactuated takeoff and landing UAVs,"This article surveys the trajectory tracking issue of underactuated vertical takeoff and landing (VTOL) unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) subject to thrust and torque faults, i.e., loss of efficiency and actuator biases. In particular, a robust control algorithm against time-varying faults and disturbances is proposed. To exploit the underactuated nature of the VTOL UAV system, the control algorithm is developed based on a hierarchical framework, under which the position and attitude loops are studied in sequence. Specifically, by implementing a novel robust fault-tolerant control strategy, a force command is first synthesized for the position tracking to the desired trajectory, and then, a desired torque using an innovative sliding manifold is designed such that the nonsingular attitude tracking to an attitude command is achieved. This attitude command, as well as the desired thrust, is extracted from the synthesized force command. In terms of hierarchical system stability theory, it is shown that the overall closed-loop error system is asymptotically stable. Finally, simulation results validate and highlight the tracking performance of the proposed control algorithm. © 2020 IEEE",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85103056434&doi=10.1109%2fTAES.2020.2975446&partnerID=40&md5=cef8bfeb795bd16b9d6fbdeda1a844cd,IEEE Transactions on Aerospace and Electronic Systems,2020
HDMI-Loc: Exploiting High Definition Map Image for Precise Localization via Bitwise Particle Filter,"In this letter, we propose a method for accurately estimating the 6-Degree Of Freedom (DOF) pose in an urban environment when a High Definition (HD) map is available. An HD map expresses 3D geometric data with semantic information in a compressed format and thus is more memory-efficient than point cloud maps. The small capacity of HD maps can be a significant advantage for autonomous vehicles in terms of map storage and updates within a large urban area. Unfortunately, existing approaches failed to sufficiently exploit HD maps by only estimating partial pose. In this study, we present a full 6-DOF localization against an HD map using an onboard stereo camera with semantic information from roads. We introduce an 8-bit representation for road information, which allow for effective bitwise operation when matching between query data and the HD map. For the pose estimation, we leverage a particle filter followed by a full 6-DOF pose optimization. Our experimental results show a median error of approximately 0.3 m in the lateral and longitudinal directions for a drive of approximately 11 km. These results can be used by autonomous vehicles to correct the global position without using Global Positioning System (GPS) data in highly complex urban environments. The median operation speed is approximately 60 msec supporting 10 Hz.  © 2016 IEEE.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85090144547&doi=10.1109%2fLRA.2020.3013881&partnerID=40&md5=727f5bd4c7344239e3ef05d5791c40e5,IEEE Robotics and Automation Letters,2020
Camera and radar-based perception system for truck platooning,"Truck platooning is a driving method with multiple trucks maintaining a very close gap between them, e.g., under 10 m at 90 km/h. The close longitudinal distance imposes a challenge for its perception system since a major portion of the front direction is occluded by the trailer in front. With this challenge, we present a radar and camera-based perception system for truck platooning. First, to improve the lane detection accuracy even with the serious occlusion problem, the distance to the front vehicle obtained by a radar is exploited to set a precise region of interest (ROI). Second, a state-of-the-art camera-based object detector is employed with our vehicle tracking mechanism. Third, the vehicle tracking information from the radar is fused to provide more reliable longitudinal information which is not available in the camera. Above methods are actually implemented in an embedded computer and evaluated in a highway driving scenario with prototype trucks. © 2020 Institute of Control, Robotics, and Systems - ICROS.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85098086588&doi=10.23919%2fICCAS50221.2020.9268196&partnerID=40&md5=6c2fc46ce8ad3b50bb292e2006d7eb5d,"International Conference on Control, Automation and Systems",2020
Novel up-scale feature aggregation for object detection in aerial images,"Object detection is a pivotal task for many unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) applications. Compared to general scenes, the objects in aerial images are typically much smaller. For this reason, most general object detectors suffer from two critical challenges while dealing with aerial images: 1) The widely exploited Feature Pyramid Network works by integrating high-level features to lower levels progressively. However, this manner does not transfer equivalent information from each level of backbone network to the generated features, and the shared detection head faces an unbalanced sources of information flow, damaging the detection accuracy. 2) Up-sampling is commonly used to expand feature resolution for feature fusion or feature aggregation. However, existing up-sampling methods are ineffective to reconstruct high resolution feature maps. To address these two challenges, two works are proposed: 1) An up-scale feature aggregation framework that fully utilizes multi-scale complementary information, and 2) a novel up-sampling method that further improve detection accuracy. These two proposals are integrated into an end-to-end single-stage object detector namely HawkNet. Extensive experiments are conducted on VisDrone-DET2018, UAVDT and DIOR datasets. Compared to the RetinaNet baseline, our HawkNet achieves absolute gains of 6.0%, 1.2% and 5.9% in average precision (AP) on VisDrone-DET2018, UAVDT and DIOR datasets, respectively. For a 800 × 1333 input on the UAVDT dataset, HawkNet with ResNet-50 backbone surpasses existing methods for single-scale inference and achieves the best performance (37.4 AP), while operating at 10.6 frames per second on a single Nvidia GTX 1080Ti GPU. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85087329363&doi=10.1016%2fj.neucom.2020.06.011&partnerID=40&md5=c27c5ab569fa0a0938b43be0dae5fb12,Neurocomputing,2020
What do pedestrians see?: Visualizing pedestrian-view intersection classification,"Extensive research has been carried out on intersection classification to assist the navigation in autonomous maneuvering of aerial, road, and cave mining vehicles. In contrast, our work tackles intersection classification at pedestrian-view level to support navigation of the slower and smaller robots for which it is too dangerous to steer on a normal road along with the usual vehicles. Particularly, we focus on investigating the kind of features a network may exploit in order to classify intersection at pedestrian-view. To this end, two sets of experiments have been conducted using an ImageNet-pretrained ResNet-18 architecture fine-tuned on our image-level pedestrian-view intersection classification dataset. First, ablation study is performed on layer depth to evaluate the importance of high-level feature, which demonstrated superiority in using all of the layers by yielding 77.56% accuracy. Second, to further clarify the need of such high level features, Class Activation Map (CAM) is applied to visualize the parts of an image that affect the most on a given prediction.

Operating point optimization of fuel cell-battery power system for unmanned underwater vehicle,"UUV(Unmanned Underwater Vehicle) is an important unmanned weapon system capable of surveillance and reconnaissance missions in threatened areas. For the UUV's power system, fuel cell and battery hybrid system capable of long submersion time and high efficiency have been widely developed. In the fuel cell and battery hybrid system, energy efficiency can be improved by power split optimization according to the power demand from UUV that changes in real time. The optimization process allows each battery and fuel cell system to be operated at the optimal point. In case of submarine, since the operation scenario is limited to a few and it mostly operates within a given mission scenario, dynamic programming method can be an efficient optimization method.

Active probing signal-based attack detection method for autonomous vehicular systems,"This paper addresses an active probing signal-based attack detection method for autonomous vehicular systems. Employing active probing signals for attack detection may become a common method for detecting replay attacks performed using prerecorded sensor data. Conventional replay attack detection methods usually operate by injecting active probing signals into the control inputs and simultaneously checking whether the effect appears on the output signals. When active probing signals are used in vehicular systems, they may change the vehicle acceleration and steering angle. The tracking performance can degrade; inspired by this issue, we develop an attack detection method employing disturbance observers. The attack detection method compensates for the effect of active probing signals and detects malicious attacks, including replay attacks. To validate the effectiveness of the proposed method, several simulations are carried out. © 2020 Institute of Control, Robotics, and Systems - ICROS.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85098062002&doi=10.23919%2fICCAS50221.2020.9268237&partnerID=40&md5=2f987f70dd1b7380001964feac569d0b,"International Conference on Control, Automation and Systems",2020
A Direct Position Determination Approach for Underwater Acoustic Sensor Networks,"In this paper, we consider the source localization problem with an underwater acoustic sensor network (UASN) consisting of a number of platforms each equipped with an array, such as an autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV). Direct position determination (DPD) has been a promising topic in recent years. Existing DPD methods can be divided into two categories: global coherent processing and non-coherent processing. The former is easy to implement in practical tasks but the coherence between the received signals at different nodes are not exploited, while the requirements for coherent processing may not be fulfilled in real environments. A multi-cluster array model is constructed considering the deployment of the nodes with the intention to exploit the available coherence in the UASN and avoiding the side effects of imperfect spatial coherence. A weighted MUSIC direct source localization approach is proposed based on this model. The arrays within a cluster work coherently as a large array and contribute a MUSIC spectrum. The final source position estimate is obtained from a weighted combination of these spectra, and the weights are dependent on the eigenstucture and noise variance of each cluster. We first investigate the theoretical gain of inter-array coherence exploitation on localization accuracy by means of Cramér-Rao bound analysis. Then the model for imperfect spatial coherence is generalized to the multi-cluster system to examine the performance of the proposed approach when the inherent constraints for intra-cluster coherent processing can not be guaranteed. Numerical results demonstrate the superior resolution capability of the proposed approach and its robustness to imperfect spatial coherence.  © 1967-2012 IEEE.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85096235488&doi=10.1109%2fTVT.2020.3018489&partnerID=40&md5=1a2c1c96219921f88f08c25f8cade68b,IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology,2020
Kalman Filters for Air Data System Bias Correction for a Fixed-Wing UAV,"This paper presents two Kalman filter approaches for correcting air data systems providing relative velocity measurements with an additive constant or slowly time-varying bias for fixed-wing unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs). In addition to the air data system, both estimators rely on a standard sensor suite consisting of a GNSS receiver, an IMU, and a heading reference. Furthermore, the estimators are based on kinematics and do not require a model of the UAV. The two estimators are in the noise-free case proven to have globally exponentially stable (GES) equilibrium points of the error dynamics if provided with persistence of excitation (PE) of the angular velocity of the UAV. The estimators are verified through simulation and using experimental flight data. The relative velocity measurements in the experimental flight results are provided by an array of pressure sensors embedded in the surface of the UAV combined with a neural network algorithm. The results indicate that a certain amount of PE is needed in order to have converging bias estimates for turbulent wind conditions. © 1993-2012 IEEE.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85085964115&doi=10.1109%2fTCST.2019.2931672&partnerID=40&md5=c232ba59463e907bf5b52731cc01cc98,IEEE Transactions on Control Systems Technology,2020
Joint Fleet Sizing and Charging System Planning for Autonomous Electric Vehicles,"This paper studies the joint fleet sizing and charging system planning problem for a company operating a fleet of autonomous electric vehicles (AEVs) for passenger and goods transportation. Most of the relevant published papers focus on intracity scenarios and adopt heuristic approaches, e.g., agent based simulation, which do not guarantee optimality. In contrast, we propose a mixed integer linear programming model for intercity scenarios. This model incorporates comprehensive considerations of 1) limited AEV driving range; 2) optimal AEV routing and relocating operations; 3) time-varying origin-destination transport demands; and 4) differentiated operation cost structure of passenger and goods transportation. The proposed model can be computational expensive when the scale of the transportation network is large. We then exploit the structure of this program to expedite its solution. Numerical experiments are conducted to validate the proposed method. Our experimental results show that AEVs in passenger and goods transportation have remarkable planning and operation differences. We also demonstrate that intelligent routing and relocating operations, charging system and vehicle parameters, e.g., charging power, battery capacity, driving speed etc., can significantly affect the economic efficiency and the planning results of an AEV fleet.  © 2000-2011 IEEE.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85096216714&doi=10.1109%2fTITS.2019.2946152&partnerID=40&md5=e4194aec100f0ac7c1f484d87e6812c7,IEEE Transactions on Intelligent Transportation Systems,2020
A Robust Predictive Control Approach for Underwater Robotic Vehicles,"This article presents a robust nonlinear model predictive control (NMPC) scheme for autonomous navigation of underwater robotic vehicles operating in a constrained workspace including the static obstacles. In particular, the purpose of the controller is to guide the vehicle toward specific way points with guaranteed input and state constraints. Various constraints, such as obstacles, workspace boundaries, predefined upper bounds for the velocity of the robotic vehicle, and thruster saturations, are considered during the control design. Moreover, the proposed control scheme is designed at dynamic level, and it incorporates the full dynamics of the vehicle in which the ocean currents are also involved. Hence, taking the thrusts as the control inputs of the robotic system and formulating them accordingly, the vehicle exploits the ocean current dynamics when these are in favor of the way-point tracking mission, resulting in reduced energy consumption by the thrusters. The robustness of the closed-loop system against parameter uncertainties has been analytically guaranteed with convergence properties.

A Two-Stage Game Framework to Secure Transmission in Two-Tier UAV Networks,"The multi-UAV network is promising to extend conventional networks by providing broader coverage, and better reliability. Nevertheless, the broadcast nature of wireless signals, and the broader coverage expose multi-UAV communications to the threats of passive eavesdroppers. Recent studies mainly focus on securing a single legitimate link, or communications between a UAV, and multiple ground users in one/two-UAV-aided networks, while the physical layer secrecy analysis for hierarchical multi-UAV networks is underexplored. In this paper, we investigate a general two-tier UAV network consisting of multiple UAV transmitters (UTs), and multiple UAV receivers (URs) in the presence of multiple UAV eavesdroppers (UEs). To protect all legitimate UT-UR links against UEs at the physical layer, we design a two-stage framework consisting of a UT-UR association stage, and a cooperative transmission stage. Specifically, we formulate the secure transmission problem into a many-to-one matching game followed by an overlapping coalition formation (OCF) game, taking into account the limited capabilities, and the throughput requirements of URs, as well as the transmission power constraints of UTs. A matching algorithm, and an OCF algorithm are proposed to solve these two sequential games whose convergences, and stabilities are guaranteed theoretically.

The main factors affecting the dynamic behavior of a vehicle, including aerodynamic forces, wheel rolling resistance, traction force resulting from changing tire-road interaction as well as the occurrence of sudden wind gusts or the presence of persistent winds, are considered and assumed to have unknown models. By exploiting the theory on delayed input-state observers and using measurement data about the vehicle and wheel speeds, a dynamic filter that allows the online reconstruction of the above-mentioned unknown time-varying quantities is derived. Moreover, by exploiting the notion of effective tire radius, a reduced-degree-of-freedom model for the longitudinal vehicle dynamics is obtained, which is independent of the traction force and that enables, when used with the observer filter described above, an accurate speed control compensating for the resistance forces. One appealing feature of the proposed estimation and control method is that it requires no model information about such forces, for which, at the state-of-the-art, only heuristic approximations to be a-priori identified are available. Its effectiveness is shown via the simulation of scenarios where the car is required to execute aggressive maneuvers and the asphalt road surface abruptly changes from dry to wet, snowy, and icy. The evaluation also reveals that the proposed estimation technique outperforms standard solutions even in the presence of measurement noise. © 1967-2012 IEEE.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85096232389&doi=10.1109%2fTVT.2020.3023059&partnerID=40&md5=a0a653d24702a93f7f0b24f56ff62c48,IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology,2020
An agent-based self-protective method to secure communication between UAVs in unmanned aerial vehicle networks,"UAVNs (unmanned aerial vehicle networks) may become vulnerable to threats and attacks due to their characteristic features such as highly dynamic network topology, open-air wireless environments, and high mobility. Since previous work has focused on classical and metaheuristic-based approaches, none of these approaches have a self-adaptive approach. In this paper, the challenges and weaknesses of previous methods are examined in the form of a table. Furthermore, we propose an agent-based self-protective method (ASP-UAVN) for UAVNs that is based on the Human Immune System (HIS). In ASP-UAS, the safest route from the source UAV to the destination UAV is chosen according to a self-protective system. In this method, a multi-agent system using an Artificial Immune System (AIS) is employed to detect the attacking UAV and choose the safest route. In the proposed ASP-UAVN, the route request packet (RREQ) is initially transmitted from the source UAV to the destination UAV to detect the existing routes. Then, once the route reply packet (RREP) is received, a self-protective method using agents and the knowledge base is employed to choose the safest route and detect the attacking UAVs. The proposed ASP-UAVN has been validated and evaluated in two ways: simulation and theoretical analysis. The results of simulation evaluation and theory analysis showed that the ASP-UAS increases the Packet Delivery Rate (PDR) by more than 17.4, 20.8, and 25.91%, and detection rate by more than 17.2, 23.1, and 29.3%, and decreases the Packet Loss Rate (PLR) by more than 14.4, 16.8, and 20.21%, the false-positive and false-negative rate by more than 16.5, 25.3, and 31.21% those of SUAS-HIS, SFA and BRUIDS methods, respectively. © 2020 Elsevier Inc.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85085755991&doi=10.1016%2fj.vehcom.2020.100267&partnerID=40&md5=141a03678a77bd3330086ee63be9930e,Vehicular Communications,2020
Beyond Vision: Hidden Car Detector with On-Demand Relaying in Vehicular Communications,"Cellular Vehicle-to-Vehicle (C-V2V) communications take autonomous driving technology to the next level by allowing a Vehicular User Equipment (V-UE) to receive Cooperative Awareness Messages (CAMs) from other V-UEs, and enable the V-UE to see beyond what is detectable by vision-based sensors, thereby preventing accidents and ensuring user safety. However, there remains a fundamental limitation in the conventional CAM broadcasting since a transmitter (TX) V-UE cannot confirm whether its CAM is successfully received at other V-UEs. Without a feedback process, a significant uncertainty arises in CAM reception, posing a critical threat to user safety. To address this threat, we propose Beyond-Vision, an effective C-V2V on-demand relay system that allows CAMs that are not well received at nearby V-UEs to be better received. Through simulation that reflects realistic vehicle mobility and road environments in urban scenarios, we verify the superiority of Beyond-Vision over the conventional C-V2V, which improves performance by up to 215% in terms of message reception ratio (MRR) within a communication range under Non-Line-Of-Sight (NLOS) channels. © 1967-2012 IEEE.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85096837632&doi=10.1109%2fTVT.2020.3036741&partnerID=40&md5=9c6229165c33c4c75b058b1152ecfac3,IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology,2020
Detection Performance to Spatially Random UAV Using the Ground Vehicle,"It is very challenging to detect an unmanned-aerial-vehicle (UAV) when it is applied to launch an attack by the enemy's country, due to its feature of mobility and flexibility. Against this background, in this paper, from wireless communication point of view, we study the detection probability of home country's ground vehicle (GV) to enemy's ground-station (GS)-to-UAV transmission system. We assume that the location of the GV is randomly distributed inside the space confined by the largest detection distance. Moreover, we assume the enemy's UAV is randomly distributed in the coverage space of the GS-to-UAV (G2A) transmission link but also keep the security distance from the GS. To this end, we first characterize the statistical features of the signal-to-noise-ratio (SNR) over the G2V and G2A links. Then, we define detection outage probability (DOP) and average detection capacity (ADC), and show their approximations. Finally, Monte-Carlo simulations are conducted to verify the correctness of our proposed analytical models.  © 1967-2012 IEEE.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85098777479&doi=10.1109%2fTVT.2020.3044860&partnerID=40&md5=0920f987bff7ce404facca1ec2890346,IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology,2020
Incentivizing Resource Cooperation for Blockchain Empowered Wireless Power Transfer in UAV Networks,"In unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) networks, UAVs-assisted wireless power transfer is a promising approach to charge low-power smart devices for energy replenishment. However, security and privacy concerns associated with the energy micro-transactions in untrusted wireless trading environment present serious challenges. In this paper, we exploit Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) and consortium blockchain to propose a new distributed and secure UAVs-assisted wireless power transfer framework named aerial-ground chain, where heterogeneous consensus is developed to verify the energy micro-transactions. Specifically, the UAVs verify energy micro-transactions simultaneously but asynchronously to form an aerial tangle. The smart devices also participate in maintaining the aerial tangle. We define timeout for the energy micro-transactions, and leverage a set of Access Points (APs) to cooperatively confirm the timeout energy micro-transaction by utilizing consortium blockchain, to form a ground main chain. Furthermore, a contract theory based resource cooperation scheme is designed to motivate the UAVs to participate in wireless power transfer, and to incentivize the APs to contribute their resources in cooperatively verifying the timeout energy micro-transactions. Security analysis and numerical results illustrate that the developed aerial-ground chain and the designed contract theory based resource cooperation scheme are secure and efficient for UAVs-assisted wireless power transfer.  © 2020 IEEE.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85096874903&doi=10.1109%2fTVT.2020.3036056&partnerID=40&md5=afb9a33fd7373f6f943001397c0b5a44,IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology,2020
Performance of Joint Sensing-Communication Cooperative Sensing UAV Network,"To exploit the spectrum reuse potential and enhance the cooperative sensing ability of the cooperative sensing unmanned aerial vehicle network (CSUN), we propose a novel joint sensing-communication (JSC) CSUN that can simultaneously conduct downward-looking radar sensing and sensing data fusion communication with the unified spectrum and transceiver by adopting the beam sharing scheme. To achieve the beam sharing scheme, we design a novel antenna array equipped on each UAV, which can generate a sensing beam and a communication beam orthogonally for downward detection and data-fusion communication, respectively. To quantify the cooperative sensing performance of CSUN, we propose and formulate a novel upper-bound average cooperative sensing area (UB-ACSA) as the cooperative sensing performance metric, based on deriving the closed-form expressions for the average mutual sensing interference of CSUN and the communication capacity constraints. Finally, extensive simulations are conducted to validate the theoretical results. We also demonstrate that the cooperative sensing performance of the JSC CSUN can improve by 66.3 percent compared with the conventional CSUN in terms of UB-ACSA. © 1967-2012 IEEE.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85097933258&doi=10.1109%2fTVT.2020.3042466&partnerID=40&md5=b969f50cb78946dffb2d039ab113a0db,IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology,2020
A Game Theoretic Scheme for Collaborative Vehicular Task Offloading in 5G HetNets,"The 5G heterogeneous networks (HetNets) are capable of providing real-time computing services for autonomous vehicles (AVs) by deploying edge computing devices (ECDs) at macro cell base stations (MCBSs) and small cell base stations (SCBSs). With the imbalanced distribution and fast moving AVs contending intensely for computing services, how to efficiently exploit cooperations among participants in 5G HetNets to improve the service performance is therefore challenging. In this paper, we develop a game theoretic scheme for collaborative vehicular task offloading to facilitate the computing services in 5G HetNets. Specifically, we propose a two-stage vehicular task offloading mechanism to promote the cooperation among participants with the target of improving the task completion rate and the utilities of the participants, where the mechanism jointly considers the network architecture of the HetNets, the imbalanced distribution of AVs and the reuse of task results. In the first stage, an auction model is designed to help the MCBS select the optimal SCBS to execute the offloaded task based on the requirement of the task and the available computing resources of SCBSs. According to the task execution cost declared by the selected SCBS, the MCBS then bargains with the AV for the agreement of the task offloading service to maximize their utilities in the second stage. Using simulations, we show that the proposed collaborative task offloading scheme can achieve a higher task completion rate for the task offloading service and bring higher utilities to all participants than conventional schemes.  © 2020 IEEE.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85097439357&doi=10.1109%2fTVT.2020.3041587&partnerID=40&md5=96bd94abe7d2bf9e55eccd1c379d7440,IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology,2020
Learning-Based Real-Time Process-Aware Anomaly Monitoring for Assured Autonomy,"Various learning-based approaches have been proposed recently for robot control in complex unknown environments. However, ensuring safety in these systems is essential. Learning-based approaches are usually black-box systems which are difficult to interpret/verify. We propose a real-time continuous safety checking system which monitors the validity of the mapping from the sensor input to the actuator command (i.e., controller-focused anomaly detection) and from the actuator command to the sensor input (i.e., system-focused anomaly detection). Our controller-focused anomaly monitor is an image conditioned energy based generative adversarial network in which the discriminator acts as an energy function attributing low energies to proper actuator commands and high energy to anomalous actuator commands. Our system-focused anomaly monitor is based on an action condition video prediction framework, which finds the action conditioned future frame most similar to the actual future frame and compares it with the true action to detect anomaly. We experimentally demonstrate the effectiveness of our framework for an autonomous navigation system in indoor (on datasets from our ground vehicle) and outdoor environments (on Udacity dataset). Furthermore, we show through experimental evaluations that our proposed framework is resilient to various data corruptions common in a vision based system.  © 2016 IEEE.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85085743603&doi=10.1109%2fTIV.2020.2997025&partnerID=40&md5=fce90c5353078aab1f5421f320cc8250,IEEE Transactions on Intelligent Vehicles,2020

Aerodynamic coefficients and control signals are used to predict the angular rates.

SEARCH: An SDN-Enabled Approach for Vehicle Path-Planning,"With increasing vehicle density and the growth of accidents in urban areas, navigation management becomes a serious problem. Even though there is a multitude of navigation systems, ambulances, taxis, or even ordinary vehicles, sometimes find it challenging to reach their destinations on time. There are two main reasons for this difficulty: (i) lack of local knowledge of the area of navigation solutions and (ii) their inflexibility against unforeseeable situations that may occur on the roads. Indeed, the majority of navigation solutions are based only on the distance, the journey time, or even statistics related to the density of vehicles to plan the full paths, while neglecting the dynamic nature of the vehicle traffic. Also, their respective centralized architectures are unable to monitor both the traffic and unexpected events continuously and in real-time without not being overloaded by the flow of message exchanges between the road entities and the central processing entity. To address these issues, we propose in this paper a novel three-tier architecture, called SDN-enabled Approach for Vehicle Path-Planning (SEARCH), to enhance the situation awareness on urban roads, efficiently collect traffic information in real-time, and decide the best navigation strategy. The proposed architecture exploits Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs), Vehicular Ad hoc Networks (VANETs), 5G based cellular systems, and Software-Defined Networking (SDN) to provide better and faster communication to changing road conditions. Based on these technologies, some parameters related to vehicles and driving environments, such as speed, distance, traffic jams, incidents, and travel flow, are efficiently collected and dynamically exploited to achieve faster paths between any existing pairs of locations. Furthermore, the deployed architecture of SEARCH can provide sufficient bandwidth to support all data traffic needs to update vehicles during their journey efficiently and in real-time. To evaluate the performance of our architecture, we conduct a series of simulations and perform a set of comparisons with relevant route planning algorithms. We found that the proposed architecture works effectively in terms of saving on driving time to reach any target destinations.  © 1967-2012 IEEE.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85097923911&doi=10.1109%2fTVT.2020.3043306&partnerID=40&md5=86f643804cdd4d6a1a58a4572be2d440,IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology,2020
Anti-Jamming 3D Trajectory Design for UAV-Enabled Wireless Sensor Networks under Probabilistic LoS Channel,"This paper investigates the anti-jamming three-dimensional (3D) trajectory design to safeguard the legitimate communications of unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV)-enabled wireless sensor networks (WSNs). Specifically, a UAV is dispatched to collect data over multiple ground sensors (GSs) in the presence of a malicious ground jammer. Under the practical probabilistic line-of-sight (LoS) channel model, we aim to maximize the minimum (average) expected rate among GSs over a finite flight period, by jointly optimizing the GS transmission scheduling, the UAV horizontal and vertical trajectories. To make the formulated non-convex problem tractable, we provide an achievable lower bound for the expected rate, based on which an efficient iterative algorithm is proposed to solve it suboptimally by exploiting the block coordinate descent and successive convex approximation techniques. Numerical results show the significant rate improvement of the proposed joint design and provide new insights into the anti-jamming 3D trajectory design under the probabilistic LoS model, as compared to the conventional two-dimensional (2D) UAV trajectory or under LoS channel models.  © 2020 IEEE.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85097210004&doi=10.1109%2fTVT.2020.3040334&partnerID=40&md5=836f5822e0fb4b5c10dd6bb2f77bd1a1,IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology,2020
Optimal Time-Consuming Path Planning for Autonomous Underwater Vehicles Based on a Dynamic Neural Network Model in Ocean Current Environments,"Path planning is a prerequisite for autonomous underwater vehicles to perform tasks autonomously. Many shortest distance algorithms are applied, and ocean currents are ignored to plan a short path in distance, which is usually time and energy consuming. In fact, the favourable currents can be exploited while avoiding the opposite ocean flows. Based on the bioinspired neural network architecture, this paper proposes a novel dynamic neural network model to plan the time-saving path in ocean current environments. After that, the path is smoothed by the B-spline algorithm. Analysis of the model shows that it can find out the minimum time path. Many simulations have also been introduced to test the effectiveness of the proposed model, showing good results. The dynamic neural network model has no learning procedure and can run in parallel. It has the advantages of loose parameter restrictions and wide spreading of neural activities. In addition, it has also been proven to be suitable for strong ocean currents.  © 1967-2012 IEEE.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85100538331&doi=10.1109%2fTVT.2020.3034628&partnerID=40&md5=ded3355db80cdfc278c43b1ef4b1c14d,IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology,2020
Reliable Smart Road Signs,"In this paper, we propose a game theoretical adversarial intervention detection mechanism for reliable smart road signs. A future trend in intelligent transportation systems is 'smart road signs' that incorporate smart codes (e.g., visible at infrared) on their surface to provide more detailed information to smart vehicles. Such smart codes make road sign classification problem aligned with communication settings more than conventional classification. This enables us to integrate well-established results in communication theory, e.g., error-correction methods, into road sign classification problem. Recently, vision-based road sign classification algorithms have been shown to be vulnerable against (even) small scale adversarial interventions that are imperceptible for humans. On the other hand, smart codes constructed via error-correction methods can lead to robustness against small scale intelligent or random perturbations on them. In the recognition of smart road signs, however, humans are out of the loop since they cannot see or interpret them. Therefore, there is no equivalent concept of imperceptible perturbations in order to achieve a comparable performance with humans. Robustness against small scale perturbations would not be sufficient since the attacker can attack more aggressively without such a constraint. Under a game theoretical solution concept, we seek to ensure certain measure of guarantees against even the worst case (intelligent) attackers that can perturb the signal even at large scale. We provide a randomized detection strategy based on the distance between the decoder output and the received input, i.e., error rate. Finally, we examine the performance of the proposed scheme over various scenarios.  © 2000-2011 IEEE.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85097246383&doi=10.1109%2fTITS.2019.2946356&partnerID=40&md5=49d99ce7f347c009a0fd4448f73fb147,IEEE Transactions on Intelligent Transportation Systems,2020
Exploiting Redundancy for Reliability Analysis of Sensor Perception in Automated Driving Vehicles,"For automated driving, the perception provided by lidar, radar, and camera sensors is safety-critical. Validating sensor perception reliability with standard empirical tests is impractical, owing to the large required test effort and the need for a reference truth to identify sensor errors. To address these challenges, we investigate the possibility of estimating sensor perception reliability without a reference truth. In particular, we propose a framework to learn sensor perception reliability solely by exploiting sensor redundancies. We formulate a likelihood function for redundant binary sensor data without a reference truth and propose a Gaussian copula to model dependent sensor errors. Synthetic numerical experiments show that under an adequate dependence model, correct sensor perception reliabilities can be estimated without a reference truth. Because the selection of an adequate dependence model is challenging without a reference truth, we also investigate how inadequate dependence models influence the estimation. The proposed framework is a step toward the validation of sensor perception reliability because it could enable the learning of reliabilities from a fleet of driver-controlled vehicles equipped with series sensors.  © 2000-2011 IEEE.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85097221657&doi=10.1109%2fTITS.2019.2948394&partnerID=40&md5=25d838f285ecddbcc4c9485299c07941,IEEE Transactions on Intelligent Transportation Systems,2020
SecAuthUAV: A Novel Authentication Scheme for UAV-Ground Station and UAV-UAV Communication,"Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) are becoming very popular nowadays due to the emergence of application areas such as the Internet of Drones (IoD). They are finding wide applicability in areas ranging from package delivery systems to automated military applications. Nevertheless, communication security between a UAV and its ground station (GS) is critical for completing its task without leaking sensitive information either to the adversaries or to unauthenticated users. UAVs are especially vulnerable to physical capture and node tampering attacks. Further, since UAV devices are generally equipped with small batteries and limited memory storage, lightweight security techniques are best suited for them. Addressing these issues, a lightweight mutual authentication scheme based on Physical Unclonable Functions (PUFs) for UAV-GS authentication is presented in this paper. The UAV-GS authentication scheme is extended further to support UAV-UAV authentication. We present a formal security analysis as well as old-fashioned cryptanalysis and show that our protocol provides various security features such as mutual authentication, user anonymity, etc, and is resilient against many security attacks such as masquerade, replay, node tampering, and cloning attacks, etc. We also compare the performance of our protocol with state-of-the-art authentication protocols for UAVs, based on computation, communication, and memory storage cost. © 1967-2012 IEEE.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85097578501&doi=10.1109%2fTVT.2020.3033060&partnerID=40&md5=d954bf9445dc05069331b285886b60de,IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology,2020
Multiobjective Optimal Parking Maneuver Planning of Autonomous Wheeled Vehicles,"This article proposes a computational trajectory optimization framework for solving the problem of multiobjective automatic parking motion planning. Constrained automatic parking maneuver problem is usually difficult to solve because of some practical limitations and requirements. This problem becomes more challenging when multiple objectives are required to be optimized simultaneously. The designed approach employs a swarm intelligent algorithm to produce the tradeoff front along the objective space. In order to enhance the local search ability of the algorithm, a gradient operation is utilized to update the solution. In addition, since the evolutionary process tends to be sensitive with respect to the flight control parameters, a novel adaptive parameter controller is designed and incorporated in the algorithm framework such that the proposed method can dynamically balance the exploitation and exploration. The performance of using the designed multiobjective strategy is validated and analyzed by performing a number of simulation and experimental studies. The results indicate that the present approach can provide reliable solutions and it can outperform other existing approaches investigated in this article.  © 1982-2012 IEEE.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85088657967&doi=10.1109%2fTIE.2019.2962482&partnerID=40&md5=f7186ee4f7ee42dbe9d9d618f3aacf18,IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics,2020
An effective discrete artificial bee colony algorithm for multi-AGVs dispatching problem in a matrix manufacturing workshop,"This paper addresses a new multiple automatic guided vehicle dispatching problem (AGVDP) from material handling process in a matrix manufacturing workshop. The problem aims to determine a solution with the objective of minimizing the transportation cost including travel cost, penalty cost for violating time and AGV cost. For this purpose, a mixed integer linear programming model is first formulated based on a comprehensive investigation. Then, a discrete artificial bee colony algorithm (DABC) is presented together with some novel and advanced techniques for solving the problem. In the proposed DABC algorithm, a nearest-neighbor-based heuristic based on the problem-specific characteristics is presented to generate an initial solution with a high level of quality. Five effective neighborhood operators are presented to generated neighboring solutions with a high level of diversity. Four theorems are proposed to avoid the unfeasible solutions generated by the neighborhood operators. Two new control parameters are introduced. One is to balance the global exploration and local exploitation in employed bee and onlooker bee phases. The other is to enhance the local exploitation capability of the neighborhood operators. Besides, an insertion-based local search method is provided for the scout bee phase to lead the algorithm to a promising region of the solution space.

Deep reinforcement learning approach for autonomous vehicle systems for maintaining security and safety using LSTM-GAN,"The success of autonomous vehicles (AVhs) depends upon the effectiveness of sensors being used and the accuracy of communication links and technologies being employed. But these sensors and communication links have great security and safety concerns as they can be attacked by an adversary to take the control of an autonomous vehicle by influencing their data. Especially during the state estimation process for monitoring of autonomous vehicles' dynamics system, these concerns require immediate and effective solution. In this paper we present a new adversarial deep reinforcement learning algorithm (NDRL) that can be used to maximize the robustness of autonomous vehicle dynamics in the presence of these attacks. In this approach the adversary tries to insert defective data to the autonomous vehicle's sensor readings so that it can disrupt the safe and optimal distance between the autonomous vehicles traveling on the road. The attacker tries to make sure that there is no more safe and optimal distance between the autonomous vehicles, thus it may lead to the road accidents. Further attacker can also add fake data in such a way that it leads to reduced traffic flow on the road. On the other hand, autonomous vehicle will try to defend itself from these types of attacks by maintaining the safe and optimal distance i.e. by minimizing the deviation so that adversary does not succeed in its mission. This attacker-autonomous vehicle action reaction can be studied through the game theory formulation with incorporating the deep learning tools. Each autonomous vehicle will use Long-Short-Term-Memory (LSTM)-Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) models to find out the anticipated distance variation resulting from its actions and input this to the new deep reinforcement learning algorithm (NDRL) which attempts to reduce the variation in distance. Whereas attacker also chooses deep reinforcement learning algorithm (NDRL) and wants to maximize the distance variation between the autonomous vehicles. © 2020 Elsevier Inc.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85085371166&doi=10.1016%2fj.vehcom.2020.100266&partnerID=40&md5=29e31e926b816524431b300739e1d6d2,Vehicular Communications,2020
The Safety Potential of Lane Keeping Assistance and Possible Actions to Improve the Potential,"Before widespread automated driving, driver assistance systems become more common and can deliver safety benefits. This study focuses on current and future lane keeping assistance (LKA) systems and their potential safety effects by analysing real-world crash data and LKA's possibilities to prevent fatal passenger car crashes. The analysed data includes in-depth analysis of 364 fatal head-on and single-vehicle crashes in Finland. According to statistical analysis, 27% of these crashes could potentially have been prevented had currently available LKA been deployed. In this study, many issues are examined related to the lane markings' visibility, infrastructure, weather, and driver-related risks, which rationalise the results, compliment previous research, and highlight possibilities to increase the safety potential of LKA. Related to the lane markings' visibility, safety potential could be improved by allocating more resources to road maintenance and to snow clearance. Advanced LKA enabling exploiting digital lane markings could hypothetically almost double the safety potential as weather conditions or the visibility of lane markings would not restrict LKA's operation. While the driver is still in charge of driving tasks, driver-related risks are difficult to manage and the crashes caused intendedly or due to driver's attack of illness are not preventable by current LKA systems.  © 2016 IEEE.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85084234656&doi=10.1109%2fTIV.2020.2991962&partnerID=40&md5=63afb20961e9f9e7176751ef1952abef,IEEE Transactions on Intelligent Vehicles,2020

In the context of automated vehicle driving, it is important for intelligent systems to know the current state of the driver to prepare handover maneuvers. Previous studies are mostly based on manually extracted features from either driving performance or driver physiological data. This methodology of a priori defined features can lead to losing valuable information of input signals that are significant to classify drowsiness levels in individual drivers because generally, it is not known which features are suitable for drowsiness prediction before classification. By using deep neural networks, features can be extracted automatically from preprocessed data. This paper presents a new non-obtrusive drowsiness detection system based on deep neural networks using vehicle-based measures. The proposed method is based on a combination of convolutional neural networks (CNN) and recurrent neural networks (RNN). Five vehicle-based measures, including lateral deviation from road centerline, lateral acceleration, yaw rate, steering wheel angle, and steering wheel velocity, are exploited as network inputs. The level of drowsiness is classified into three different classes. Long-short term memory (LSTM) and gated recurrent unit (GRU) layers are used as RNN in the structure of the designed deep network. The performance of the proposed method is evaluated on experimental data that were collected from 44 sessions in a fixed-base driving simulator simulating monotonous night-time highway drives. Results show that the classification accuracy of the designed deep networks outperforms traditional classifiers like support vector machine and k-nearest neighbors. The highest accuracy of 96.0% has been achieved with a combination of CNN and LSTM (CNN-LSTM). Further research should include more signal sources, including unobtrusively taken physiological signals, and test the system in real-world conditions. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85088821473&doi=10.1016%2fj.eswa.2020.113778&partnerID=40&md5=44ce5534f4ac4a0925ab929865c59436,Expert Systems with Applications,2020
Optimal 3D time-energy trajectory planning for AUVs using ocean general circulation models,"This paper develops a new approach for solving optimal time and energy trajectory planning problems for Autonomous Underwater Vehicles (AUVs) in transient, 3D, ocean currents. Realistic forecasts using an Ocean General Circulation Model (OGCM) are used for this purpose. The approach is based on decomposing the problem into a minimal time problem, followed by minimal energy subproblems. In both cases, a non-linear programming (NLP) formulation is adopted. The scheme is demonstrated for time-energy trajectory planning problems in the Gulf of Aden. In particular, the numerical experiments illustrate the capability of generating Pareto optimal solutions in a broad range of mission durations. In addition, the analysis also highlights how the methodology effectively exploits both the vertical structure of the current field, as well as its unsteadiness, namely to minimize travel time and energy consumption. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85094597960&doi=10.1016%2fj.oceaneng.2020.108057&partnerID=40&md5=ae0b291bdf73d8ba9ec23b208f2220dd,Ocean Engineering,2020
Embodied Semantic Scene Graph Generation,"Semantic scene graph provides an effective way for intelligent agents to better understand the environment and it has been extensively used in many robotic applications. Existing work mainly focuses on generating the scene graph from the sensory information collected from a pre-defined path, while the environment should be exhaustively explored with a carefully designed path in order to obtain a comprehensive semantic scene graph efficiently. In this paper, we propose a new task of Embodied Semantic Scene Graph Generation, which exploits the embodiment of the intelligent agent to autonomously generate an appropriate path to explore the environment for scene graph generation. To this end, a learning framework with the paradigms of imitation learning and reinforcement learning is proposed to help the agent generate proper actions to explore the environment and the scene graph is incrementally constructed. The proposed method is evaluated on the AI2Thor environment using both the quantitative and qualitative performance indexes. Additionally, we implement the proposed method on a streaming video captioning task and promising experimental results are achieved. © 2021 Proceedings of Machine Learning Research.

Exploring Adversarial Robustness of Multi-sensor Perception Systems in Self Driving,"Modern self-driving perception systems have been shown to improve upon processing complementary inputs such as LiDAR with images. In isolation, 2D images have been found to be extremely vulnerable to adversarial attacks. Yet, there are limited studies on the adversarial robustness of multi-modal models that fuse LiDAR and image features. Furthermore, existing works do not consider physically realizable perturbations that are consistent across the input modalities. In this paper, we showcase practical susceptibilities of multi-sensor detection by inserting an adversarial object on a host vehicle. We focus on physically realizable and input-agnostic attacks that are feasible to execute in practice, and show that a single universal adversary can hide different host vehicles from state-of-the-art multi-modal detectors. Our experiments demonstrate that successful attacks are primarily caused by easily corrupted image features. Furthermore, in modern sensor fusion methods which project image features into 3D, adversarial attacks can exploit the projection process to generate false positives in distant regions in 3D. Towards more robust multi-modal perception systems, we show that adversarial training with feature denoising can boost robustness to such attacks significantly. © 2021 Proceedings of Machine Learning Research.

Learning to Predict Vehicle Trajectories with Model-based Planning,"Predicting the future trajectories of on-road vehicles is critical for autonomous driving. In this paper, we introduce a novel prediction framework called PRIME, which stands for Prediction with Model-based Planning. Unlike recent prediction works that utilize neural networks to model scene context and produce unconstrained trajectories, PRIME is designed to generate accurate and feasibility-guaranteed future trajectory predictions. PRIME guarantees the trajectory feasibility by exploiting a model-based generator to produce future trajectories under explicit constraints and enables accurate multimodal prediction by utilizing a learning-based evaluator to select future trajectories. We conduct experiments on the large-scale Argoverse Motion Forecasting Benchmark, where PRIME outperforms the state-of-the-art methods in prediction accuracy, feasibility, and robustness under imperfect tracking. © 2021 Proceedings of Machine Learning Research.

Design of Anomaly Detection Functions for Controller Area Networks,"Vehicles are becoming increasingly autonomous and connected, leading to an increase in the types of security threats to vehicles. Controller Area Network (CAN) is a serial bus system that is used to connect sensors and controllers (Electronic Control Units - ECUs) within a vehicle. ECUs vary widely in processing power, storage, memory, and connectivity. There is a need for efficient security countermeasures for protecting the CAN from various attacks. In this paper, we present a novel process to efficiently design functions that can be used for anomaly detection. Our earlier work successfully demonstrated the use of Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) Networks to perform anomaly detection. This paper focuses on the efficient design and testing of functions that are attack-resistant and can be used in our anomaly detection engine. Once trained, our system is capable of efficiently detecting anomalies in real-time. We report the results of our anomaly detection function design process. We also present the results of our overall anomaly detection engine that are used as inputs to our detection engine. Our function design process and anomaly detection engine have been tested on data from real automobiles.

Considerations for Cyber Security Implementation in Autonomous Vehicle Systems,"Security threats in autonomous vehicle systems are increasing day by day. Unlike systems in other industries, the damage caused by increased security threats in autonomous vehicle systems is directly related to the driver and pedestrian's life. So, the implementation of cyber security in autonomous vehicle systems is an essential element. In the automotive industry, international standardization and regulatory activities are actively underway to apply cyber security to vehicle systems in order to respond to cyber-attacks from the outside. Representatively, UNECE adopts regulation on CSMS (Cyber Security Management System), making it mandatory to implement cyber security for vehicles and apply the management system. The paper provides considerations for cyber security implementation based on UN Regulation No. 155 such as secure boot, secure communication and secure debug in autonomous vehicle systems.  © 2021 ICROS.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85124192030&doi=10.23919%2fICCAS52745.2021.9649850&partnerID=40&md5=f0b64f873331915b1a6d25fec097bade,"International Conference on Control, Automation and Systems",2021
Environment Exploration for Mapless Navigation based on Deep Reinforcement Learning,"In recent years, reinforcement learning has attracted researchers' attention with the AlphaGo event. Especially in autonomous mobile robots, the reinforcement learning approach can be applied to the mapless navigation problem. The Robot can complete the set tasks well and works well in different environments without maps and ready-made path plans. However, for reinforcement learning in general and mapless navigation based on reinforcement learning in particular, exploitation and exploration balance are issues that need to be carefully considered. Specifically, the fact that the agent (Robot) can discover and execute actions in a particular working environment plays a significant role in improving the performance of the reinforcement learning problem. By creating some noise during the convolutional neural network training, the above problem can be solved by some popular approaches today. With outstanding advantages compared to other approaches, the Boltzmann policy approach has been used in our problem. It helps the Robot explore more thoroughly in complex environments, and the policy is also more optimized.  © 2021 ICROS.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85124212361&doi=10.23919%2fICCAS52745.2021.9649893&partnerID=40&md5=92f6bd7302f50b66a56d641d0514df89,"International Conference on Control, Automation and Systems",2021
Aerial-Satellite Image Matching Framework for UAV Absolute Visual Localization using Contrastive Learning,"We present an Aerial-Satellite imagery matching framework for UAVs visual localization. The usage of Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) has been continuously increasing in many applications, such as defense, agriculture, mapping, and observation. Localization plays an essential role in UAVs navigation system. The Global Positioning System (GPS) is mainly applied for localization; however, GPS interference may occur in a GPS-denied environment. One alternative that can be used is to use a pre-existing satellite image. By comparing aerial photographs with geo-tagged satellite images, global coordinates can be estimated in an intuitive way. However, due to various factors (such as weather, light conditions, and seasonal changes), it draws different visual representations between aerial and satellite imagery. To address this problem, we propose a image matching framework that exploits CNN-based Siamese Neural Network with contrastive learning method. The proposed framework firstly takes two input data; aerial image and satellite image of the area where UAV is estimated to be. By image retrieval and matching process, it predicts global coordinates of center of the aerial image. In this paper, we describe the structure of framework, data preparation, and the efficient representation learning strategy for downstream tasks. Additionally, we evaluate the performance of the proposed framework by measuring RMSE.  © 2021 ICROS.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85124242552&doi=10.23919%2fICCAS52745.2021.9649999&partnerID=40&md5=edfae6fc2bfbc9e102ef1b6758e4f11d,"International Conference on Control, Automation and Systems",2021
Wireless SDN Self-Recovery for Unmanned Swarm Cyber-Physical Systems,"The unmanned swarm cyber-physical system (USCPS) is composed of a number of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), unmanned ground vehicles (UGVs), and ground control station (GCS) to perform cooperative missions. The USCPS has a dynamic topology because unmanned vehicles (UVs) move, enter, or withdraw from the field for missions, and UVs are likely to be dropped due to defects or external attacks. In this paper, we propose a topology self-recovery scheme that responds to UV defects causing isolated clusters. UVs that are isolated from a control device are not only unable to perform missions, but also are not able to carry out the conventional recovery process. Consequently, we introduce a software-defined networking (SDN) based USCPS that can recover the UVs from isolation.  © 2021 ICROS.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85124211572&doi=10.23919%2fICCAS52745.2021.9649967&partnerID=40&md5=fa654333ac27846f903853a91a659cf6,"International Conference on Control, Automation and Systems",2021
Learning Control Applications for Autonomous Driving in Extreme Maneuver Scenarios,"This work presents the applications of iterative learning control for autonomous vehicle in extreme maneuver scenarios. By exploiting data from previous executions, the proposed learning algorithm that uses a simple kinematic model can generate optimal feedforward control signals to improve vehicle control performance against nonlinearity, model uncertainties and disturbance. The design developments are validated using a co-simulation structure of Siemens Simcenter Amesim and Prescan software.

Autonomous Well Logging Robot with Passive Locomotion,"Downhole tools used in the oil and gas industry are usually controlled by an operator and tethered to the surface equipment via a few kilometers of long steel cable. Due to the total weight and volume of this steel cable, operating downhole tools requires a truck for transportation, winch, crane, and lubricator for placing into a well, and full time supervision by a trained crew. The large footprint of the operations brings time and cost inefficiency even when the task can be as simple as measuring the pressure and temperature downhole. There is a big opportunity to apply robotics and automation technologies to increase the efficiency of wellsite operations. Currently, robots have limited use in downhole applications mainly because of harsh environment and challenging working space. There are a number of robotic extensions designed as attachments to the tethered tools that can work semi-autonomously. By means of miniaturization and automation, it's possible to make an untethered downhole robot that can significantly reduce the operation footprint and increase time and cost efficiency. Here, we show a miniature untethered well logging robot that can autonomously travel and measure temperature and pressure. A key to miniaturization was to reduce energy consumption. Robots use their energy storage predominantly for locomotion. We exploited potential energies arising from gravity and buoyancy for the passively moving the robot inside vertical wells. We investigated the passive locomotion design considerations to avoid downhole obstacles.  © 2021 ICROS.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85124181176&doi=10.23919%2fICCAS52745.2021.9649751&partnerID=40&md5=1e5ccdff5f8c11d955eb1aaa60bab5e2,"International Conference on Control, Automation and Systems",2021
Stop-and-Go: Exploring Backdoor Attacks on Deep Reinforcement Learning-Based Traffic Congestion Control Systems,"Recent work has shown that the introduction of autonomous vehicles (AVs) in traffic could help reduce traffic jams. Deep reinforcement learning methods demonstrate good performance in complex control problems, including autonomous vehicle control, and have been used in state-of-the-art AV controllers. However, deep neural networks (DNNs) render automated driving vulnerable to machine learning-based attacks. In this work, we explore the backdooring/trojanning of DRL-based AV controllers. We develop a trigger design methodology that is based on well-established principles of traffic physics. The malicious actions include vehicle deceleration and acceleration to cause stop-and-go traffic waves to emerge (congestion attacks) or AV acceleration resulting in the AV crashing into the vehicle in front (insurance attack). We test our attack on single-lane and two-lane circuits. Our experimental results show that the backdoored model does not compromise normal operation performance, with the maximum decrease in cumulative rewards being 1%. Still, it can be maliciously activated to cause a crash or congestion when the corresponding triggers appear. © 2005-2012 IEEE.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85115726633&doi=10.1109%2fTIFS.2021.3114024&partnerID=40&md5=04836961d860bd18a935b95779918029,IEEE Transactions on Information Forensics and Security,2021
"Morphing Attack Detection-Database, Evaluation Platform, and Benchmarking","Morphing attacks have posed a severe threat to Face Recognition System (FRS). Despite the number of advancements reported in recent works, we note serious open issues such as independent benchmarking, generalizability challenges and considerations to age, gender, ethnicity that are inadequately addressed. Morphing Attack Detection (MAD) algorithms often are prone to generalization challenges as they are database dependent. The existing databases, mostly of semi-public nature, lack in diversity in terms of ethnicity, various morphing process and post-processing pipelines. Further, they do not reflect a realistic operational scenario for Automated Border Control (ABC) and do not provide a basis to test MAD on unseen data, in order to benchmark the robustness of algorithms. In this work, we present a new sequestered dataset for facilitating the advancements of MAD where the algorithms can be tested on unseen data in an effort to better generalize. The newly constructed dataset consists of facial images from 150 subjects from various ethnicities, age-groups and both genders. In order to challenge the existing MAD algorithms, the morphed images are with careful subject pre-selection created from the contributing images, and further post-processed to remove morphing artifacts. The images are also printed and scanned to remove all digital cues and to simulate a realistic challenge for MAD algorithms. Further, we present a new online evaluation platform to test algorithms on sequestered data. With the platform we can benchmark the morph detection performance and study the generalization ability. This work also presents a detailed analysis on various subsets of sequestered data and outlines open challenges for future directions in MAD research.  © 2005-2012 IEEE.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85114798062&doi=10.1109%2fTIFS.2020.3035252&partnerID=40&md5=6191faf373c2a6898313d1ac2bd1dc8e,IEEE Transactions on Information Forensics and Security,2021
Who Is in Control? Practical Physical Layer Attack and Defense for mmWave-Based Sensing in Autonomous Vehicles,"With the wide bandwidths in millimeter wave (mmWave) frequency band that results in unprecedented accuracy, mmWave sensing has become vital for many applications, especially in autonomous vehicles (AVs). In addition, mmWave sensing has superior reliability compared to other sensing counterparts such as camera and LiDAR, which is essential for safety-critical driving. Therefore, it is critical to understand the security vulnerabilities and improve the security and reliability of mmWave sensing in AVs. To this end, we perform the end-to-end security analysis of a mmWave-based sensing system in AVs, by designing and implementing practical physical layer attack and defense strategies in a state-of-the-art mmWave testbed and an AV testbed in real-world settings. Various strategies are developed to take control of the victim AV by spoofing its mmWave sensing module, including adding fake obstacles at arbitrary locations and faking the locations of existing obstacles. Five real-world attack scenarios are constructed to spoof the victim AV and force it to make dangerous driving decisions leading to a fatal crash. Field experiments are conducted to study the impact of the various attack scenarios using a Lincoln MKZ-based AV testbed, which validate that the attacker can indeed assume control of the victim AV to compromise its security and safety. To defend the attacks, we design and implement a challenge-response authentication scheme and a RF fingerprinting scheme to reliably detect aforementioned spoofing attacks.  © 2005-2012 IEEE.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85105090239&doi=10.1109%2fTIFS.2021.3076287&partnerID=40&md5=2c01fbc9535b4716ff8d8c25680b9a14,IEEE Transactions on Information Forensics and Security,2021
Secrecy Performance Analysis of Air-to-Ground Communication with UAV Jitter and Multiple Random Walking Eavesdroppers,"Flexible mobility and random jitter are two unique features of UAV communication platforms. Although advantages of mobility have been extensively explored, the random jitter of UAV platforms, caused by airflow and body vibrations, has been rarely studied. This work aims to answer the two fundamental questions: i) how to analyze the secrecy performance when considering UAV jitter and ii) can this inherent characteristic of UAV be exploited to enhance secrecy? Detailed, we study the modeling and analysis of UAV jitter on the secrecy performance in an air-to-ground (A2G) wiretap system with multiple non-colluding eavesdroppers, where a UAV-mounted transmitter equipped with directional antennas illuminates ground terminals in a finite area. Random waypoint model is applied to characterize the mobility of eavesdroppers. To be specific, by modeling UAV jitter in both horizontal azimuth and vertical elevation, distortion and shift of UAV illumination area are analyzed. Further, beam-illumination probability of a randomly located ground terminal is obtained. Following which, a tractable framework for analyzing the secrecy coverage probability (SCP) and ergodic secrecy capacity (ESC) is developed. Expressions for SCP and ESC are derived with characterizations for the signal-to-noise ratio received at legitimate receiver and eavesdroppers. Finally, extensive simulations are provided to validate the theoretical analysis. This is the first work to find that UAV jitter can be exploited to enhanced secrecy performance of A2G wiretap system with appropriate UAV height and beamwidth.  © 1967-2012 IEEE.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85098764730&doi=10.1109%2fTVT.2020.3047082&partnerID=40&md5=05f9f20dfd1dab136b10766583022ef5,IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology,2021
Automated Decision System to Exploit Network Diversity for Connected Vehicles,"In this work, we introduce a methodology that takes advantage of the inherent network diversity present in vehicular communications to improve the performance of safety applications. This methodology is based on a framework that simultaneously exploits the strengths of each individual network by using a set of decision rules. The implementation begins with a manual approach in which a typical, hierarchical decision tree characterizes the decision process of a single application when sending data to other users in the network. Analytical and simulation results validate the decision system approach when diversity is exploited as demonstrated by a boost in application performance, achieving an average latency under 100 ms and a 40% increase in throughput due to the increased packet delivery ratio. We then apply an ensemble learning technique, Random Forests (RF), to automatically reproduce the performance of the manually built tree system. Simulations under realistic traffic scenarios show the RF approach can replicate manually-built tree performance with up to 98% precision. A comparison with another state-of-the-art hybrid method also shows the RF scheme improves performance under a different application scenario without additional manual adjustments. With our methodology, we can add different application requirements and network characteristics to obtain a fully automated and adaptable decision system to optimize vehicular safety applications. © 1967-2012 IEEE.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85098765542&doi=10.1109%2fTVT.2020.3046413&partnerID=40&md5=1f40a17c37397a2640b8b1777cac026b,IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology,2021
Distributed and energy-efficient mobile crowdsensing with charging stations by deep reinforcement learning,"Mobile crowdsensing (MCS) represents a new sensing paradigm that utilizes the smart mobile devices to collect and share data. Traditional MCS systems mainly leverages the people carried smartphones and other wearable devices which are constrained by the limited sensing capability and battery power. With the popularity of unmanned vehicles like unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) and driverless cars, they can provide much more reliable, accurate and cost-efficient sensing services due to to their equipped more powerful sensors. In this paper, we propose a distributed control framework for energy-efficient and DIstributed VEhicle navigation with chaRging sTations, called 'e-Divert'. It is a distributed multi-agent deep reinforcement learning (DRL) solution, which uses a convolutional neural network (CNN) to extract useful spatial features as the input to the actor-critic network to produce a real-time action. Also, e-Divert incorporates a distributed prioritized experience replay for better exploration and exploitation, and a long short-term memory (LSTM) enabled N-step temporal sequence modeling module. The solution fully explores the spatiotemporal nature of the considered scenario for better vehicle cooperation and competition between themselves and charging stations, to maximize the energy efficiency, data collection ratio, geographic fairness, and minimize the energy consumption simultaneously. Through extensive simulations, we find an appropriate set of hyperparameters that achieve the best performance, i.e., 5 actors in Ape-X architecture, priority exponent 0.5, and LSTM sequence length 3. Finally, we compare with four baselines including one state-of-the-art approach MADDPG. Results show that our proposed e-Divert significantly improves the energy efficiency, as compared to MADDPG, by 3.62 and 2.36 times on average when varying different numbers of vehicles and charging stations, respectively.  © 2002-2012 IEEE.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85092744290&doi=10.1109%2fTMC.2019.2938509&partnerID=40&md5=fe5446436f1cc244ba753d8c32ae7319,IEEE Transactions on Mobile Computing,2021
UAV-Assisted Data Collection with Nonorthogonal Multiple Access,"Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) facilitate information collection greatly in the Internet-of-Things (IoT) systems due to their superior flexibility and mobility. On the other hand, nonorthogonal multiple access (NOMA) is regarded as a promising technology to provide high spectral efficiency and support massive connectivity in fifth-generation networks. The integration of NOMA into UAV-Assisted wireless networks shows great potential, but how to determine the user grouping and power allocation in NOMA according to the high mobility of UAV is challenging. In this article, we propose a general NOMA-enabled UAV-Assisted data collection (NUDC) protocol to maximize the sum rate of a wireless sensor network (WSN), where the location of UAV, sensor grouping, and power control are jointly considered. Moreover, a joint signal-To-interference ratio (SIR) hypergraph-based grouping and power control (SHG-PC) NOMA scheme is provided to obtain the appropriate sensor grouping and the optimal power control solutions efficiently, in which the hypergraph and the greedy coloring algorithm are exploited to find out the optimized group relationships.

Detection of anomalous vehicles using physics of traffic,"The world is embracing the presence of connected autonomous vehicles which are expected to play a major role in the future of intelligent transport systems. Given such connectivity, vehicles in the networks are vulnerable to making incorrect decisions due to anomalous data. No sophisticated attacks are required; just a vehicle reporting anomalous speeds would be enough to disrupt the entire traffic flow. Detection of such anomalies is vital to ensure the security of a vehicular network. We propose the use of traffic flow theory for anomalous data detection in vehicular networks, by evaluating the consistency of microscopic parameters which are derived by traffic flow theory (i.e. speed and space-headway) with macroscopic views of traffic under different traffic conditions. Though a little attention has been given to using traffic flow properties to determine anomalous basic safety message (BSM) data, the fundamental nature of traffic flow properties makes it a robust assessment tool. Usually, traffic flow data are determined through roadside units (RSUs) such as cameras and loop detectors; they are financially impractical to roll out on an entire network. Therefore, the method proposed in this study establishes traffic flow data that are used as “ground truth” through RSUs if available, or by the vehicles' own sensor systems. The numerical results indicate that the proposed method provides extremely reliable and consistent predictions of anomalous BSM data. The more the road segment is congested, the higher the accuracy of the anomalous space-headway detection. The anomalous speed detection performs robustly well across all the traffic conditions. The study also finds that both global and local ground truths provide consistent results. © 2020 Elsevier Inc.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85092012205&doi=10.1016%2fj.vehcom.2020.100304&partnerID=40&md5=92a24322d325460ffc9a2d82b67f1c84,Vehicular Communications,2021
Aerodynamic performance of mutual interaction tandem propellers with ducted UAV,"This paper describes progress made on the new design and analysis of a twin-propeller (front and rear) with duct. Major advantage of this design is that the Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) could complete the mission with only one engine, in the case of failure in one of the engines. Such a design also makes a fair weight distribution within the UAV, which makes it more stable. Furthermore, this design makes it possible to arm the UAV with missiles and other military equipment easily. Ducts traditionally increase the propulsive force produced by propeller at high speeds. Improper design of the duct can result in performance loss of the UAV. Therefore, the UAV model with Six different duct configurations is analyzed to find the most appropriate duct design. The Moving Reference Frame (MRF) method is implemented and examined in CFD simulations for flows around a moving rigid body.

Hierarchical MPC for Robust Eco-Cooling of Connected and Automated Vehicles and Its Application to Electric Vehicle Battery Thermal Management,"Connected and autonomous vehicles (CAVs) have situational awareness that can be exploited for optimal power and thermal management. In this article, we develop a hierarchical model predictive control (H-MPC) strategy for eco-cooling of CAVs, which reduces energy consumption through real-time prediction and multi-timescale and multi-layer optimization. The application of the proposed H-MPC is studied for battery thermal and energy management of an electric vehicle (EV). Our H-MPC approach addresses the uncertainty in the long-term preview of the vehicle speed through robust constraint handling to prevent constraint violation. The simulation results show that compared with a conventional battery thermal management (BTM) strategy, the proposed robust H-MPC saves the battery energy by up to 5.4% under the uncertainties in the long-term vehicle speed predictions in an urban CAV operation scenario. © 1993-2012 IEEE.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85098134698&doi=10.1109%2fTCST.2020.2975464&partnerID=40&md5=66f107d6c938a0ffb76c25c5d6e6d123,IEEE Transactions on Control Systems Technology,2021
Ad Hoc Vehicular Fog Enabling Cooperative Low-Latency Intrusion Detection,"Internet of Vehicles and vehicular networks have been compelling targets for malicious security attacks where several intrusion detection solutions have been proposed for protecting them. Nonetheless, their main problem lies in their heavy computation, which makes them unsuitable for next-generation artificial intelligence-powered self-driving vehicles whose computational power needs to be primarily reserved for real-time driving decisions. To address this challenge, several approaches have been lately presented to take advantage of the cloud computing for offloading intrusion detection tasks to central cloud servers, thus reducing storage and processing costs on vehicles. However, centralized cloud computing entails high latency on intrusion detection related data transmission and plays against its adoption in delay-critical intelligent applications. In this context, this article proposes a vehicular-edge computing (VEC) fog-enabled scheme allowing offloading intrusion detection tasks to federated vehicle nodes located within nearby formed ad hoc vehicular fog to be cooperatively executed with minimal latency. The problem has been formulated as a multiobjective optimization model and solved using a genetic algorithm maximizing offloading survivability in the presence of high mobility and minimizing computation execution time and energy consumption. Experiments performed on resource-constrained devices within actual ad hoc fog environment illustrate that our solution significantly reduces the execution time of the detection process while maximizing the offloading survivability under different real-life scenarios. © 2014 IEEE.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85099123407&doi=10.1109%2fJIOT.2020.3008488&partnerID=40&md5=0178d2e07e076ebba760330102ea8da8,IEEE Internet of Things Journal,2021
Harnessing connected and automated vehicle technologies to control lane changes at freeway merge bottlenecks in mixed traffic,"This paper proposes three control strategies for lane-changing (LC) at a merge bottleneck to improve bottleneck throughput by mitigating voids and speed disturbances in mixed traffic using connected and automated vehicle (CAV) technologies. Strategy 1 is ‘gap closure’ control, where an LC vehicle and its follower are controlled to close the void (extra time gap ahead) induced by the LC and prevent a backward-propagating speed disturbance. Strategy 2 is ‘batch LC’, where a group of LC vehicles are controlled to line up along a kinematic wave to minimize the total voids. Strategy 3 is ‘gap redistribution’ control, where extra gaps of vehicles are redistributed to periodically create large enough gaps for disturbance-free insertions. In a general control framework, the three strategies are integrated in different combinations exploiting their complementary nature. A numerical analysis shows that certain combinations, such as Strategy 2 and 3, can be very effective for improving bottleneck throughput. The analysis reveals insights on leveraging CAVs to develop traffic management strategies and/or policies and therefore improve system performance. © 2021",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85099860189&doi=10.1016%2fj.trc.2020.102950&partnerID=40&md5=cbbc8a69a636bd4f4984c20e92764f92,Transportation Research Part C: Emerging Technologies,2021
Dynamic Discrete Pigeon-Inspired Optimization for Multi-UAV Cooperative Search-Attack Mission Planning,"For multiple unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) performing aerial search-attack tasks, there is a tradeoff between maximizing total benefit and minimizing consumption under the validity of constraints. This article proposes a dynamic discrete pigeon-inspired optimization algorithm to handle cooperative search-attack mission planning for UAVs, which integrates the centralized task assignment and distributed path generation aspects of the problem. Besides, a solution acceptance strategy is proposed to avoid frequent task switching. To design a reasonable objective function, the probability map is constructed and updated by Bayes formula to guide the following search motion, and a response threshold sigmoid model is adopted for target allocation during executing attack. Moreover, the flyable trajectories are generated by B-spline curves based on the simplified waypoints. Finally, numerical experiments prove that the proposed methods can provide feasible solutions for multiple UAVs considering different scenarios, such as the absence or presence of threats and insufficient resources. The results also show that the solution acceptance strategy is effective to improve performance. Moreover, the extensible mission planning system also integrates with an interactive 3D visualization simulation module, where the multi-UAV coordinated flight processes are demonstrated dynamically.  © 1965-2011 IEEE.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85101430390&doi=10.1109%2fTAES.2020.3029624&partnerID=40&md5=8642758939cf65872d76288a60648b63,IEEE Transactions on Aerospace and Electronic Systems,2021
AC4AV: A Flexible and Dynamic Access Control Framework for Connected and Autonomous Vehicles,"Sensing data plays a pivotal role in connected and autonomous vehicles (CAVs), enabling CAV to perceive surroundings. For example, malicious applications might tamper this life-critical data, resulting in erroneous driving decisions and threatening the safety of passengers. Access control, one of the promising solutions to protect data from unauthorized access, is urgently needed for vehicle sensing data. However, due to the intrinsic complexity of vehicle sensing data, including historical and real time, and access patterns of different data sources, there is currently no suitable access control framework that can systematically solve this problem; current frameworks only focus on one aspect. In this article, we propose a novel and flexible access control framework, AC4AV, which aims to support various access control models, and provide APIs for dynamically adjusting access control models and developing customized access control models, thus supporting access control research on CAV for the community. In addition, we propose a data abstraction method to clearly identify data, applications, and access operations in CAV, and therefore is easily able to configure the permits of each data and application in access control policies. We have implemented a prototype to demonstrate our architecture on NATS for real-time data and NGINX for historical data, and three access control models as built-in models. We measured the performance of our AC4AV while applying these access control models to real-time and historical data. The experimental results show that the framework has little impact on real-time data access within a tolerable range.  © 2014 IEEE.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85100267347&doi=10.1109%2fJIOT.2020.3016961&partnerID=40&md5=af4998d06004b10f7f39261e5b1805c8,IEEE Internet of Things Journal,2021
Integrity for Multi-Sensor Cooperative Positioning,"A cooperative integrity monitoring (CIM) algorithm is proposed in this work. Under the CIM architecture, the algorithm can fully exploit the global navigation satellite system (GNSS) data and inter-vehicle measurements data to improve the detection and isolation of faulty measurements due to multipath or non line of sight (NLOS). Taking the advantages of cooperative scheme, a residual decomposition method is used to model the measurement errors into common and specific parts, a greedy search strategy is used to exclude the faulty measurements based on its sub-statistics. Simulation results show that CIM has better detection of GNSS fault than traditional receiver autonomous integrity monitoring (RAIM). Also, CIM is capable of detecting the faulty outliers in inter-vehicle measurements. The results indicate that CIM can be applied to many existing multi-sensor cooperative positioning algorithms. © 2000-2011 IEEE.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85100543316&doi=10.1109%2fTITS.2019.2956936&partnerID=40&md5=7574ec789d82999d903a7bb213a89313,IEEE Transactions on Intelligent Transportation Systems,2021
Vehicle Position Correction: A Vehicular Blockchain Networks-Based GPS Error Sharing Framework,"The positioning accuracy of the existing vehicular Global Positioning System (GPS) is far from sufficient to support autonomous driving and ITS applications. To remedy that, leading methods such as ranging and cooperation have improved the positioning accuracy to varying degrees, but they are still full of challenges in practical applications. Especially for cooperative positioning, in addition to the performance of methods, cooperators may provide false data due to attacks or selfishness, which can seriously affect the positioning accuracy. By fully exploiting the characteristics of blockchain and edge computing, this paper proposes a vehicular blockchain-based secure and efficient GPS positioning error evolution sharing framework, which improves vehicle positioning accuracy from ensuring security and credibility of cooperators and data. First, by analyzing the GPS error, a bridge can be established between the sensor-rich vehicles and the common vehicles to achieve cooperation by sharing the positioning error evolution at a specific time and location. Particularly, the positioning error evolution is obtained by a deep neural network (DNN)-based prediction algorithm running on the edge server. We further propose to use blockchain technology for storage and sharing the evolution of positioning errors, mainly to guarantee the security of cooperative vehicles and mobile edge computing nodes (MECNs). In addition, the corresponding smart contracts are designed to automate and efficiently perform storage and sharing tasks as well as solve inconsistencies in time scales. Extensive simulations based on actual data indicate the accuracy and security of our proposal in terms of positioning error correction and data sharing.  © 2000-2011 IEEE.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85100528823&doi=10.1109%2fTITS.2019.2961400&partnerID=40&md5=303564c7c3cebfc2af2785dae9bb7812,IEEE Transactions on Intelligent Transportation Systems,2021
Detecting and Identifying Optical Signal Attacks on Autonomous Driving Systems,"For autonomous driving, an essential task is to detect surrounding objects accurately. To this end, most existing systems use optical devices, including cameras and light detection and ranging (LiDAR) sensors, to collect environment data in real time. In recent years, many researchers have developed advanced machine learning models to detect surrounding objects. Nevertheless, the aforementioned optical devices are vulnerable to optical signal attacks, which could compromise the accuracy of object detection. To address this critical issue, we propose a framework to detect and identify sensors that are under attack. Specifically, we first develop a new technique to detect attacks on a system that consists of three sensors. Our main idea is to: 1) use data from three sensors to obtain two versions of depth maps (i.e., disparity) and 2) detect attacks by analyzing the distribution of disparity errors. In our study, we use real data sets and the state-of-the-art machine learning model to evaluate our attack detection scheme and the results confirm the effectiveness of our detection method. Based on the detection scheme, we further develop an identification model that is capable of identifying up to n-2 attacked sensors in a system with one LiDAR and n cameras. We prove the correctness of our identification scheme and conduct experiments to show the accuracy of our identification method. Finally, we investigate the overall sensitivity of our framework. © 2014 IEEE.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85099130942&doi=10.1109%2fJIOT.2020.3011690&partnerID=40&md5=c287c834902c26c6f32c136051a6fedb,IEEE Internet of Things Journal,2021
A Multi-Channel MAC Protocol with Retrodirective Array Antennas in Flying Ad Hoc Networks,"In this paper, we propose a multi-channel medium access control (MMAC) protocol for the exploitation of retro-directive array antennas in Flying Ad Hoc Networks (named FA-MMAC). This FA-MMAC employs multiple channels and retro-directive array antennas to adjacent unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) to transmit simultaneously over the same channel without causing interference. The channel utilization characteristic of FA-MMAC increases the spatial reuse of channel and thus improve the system performance. The key idea is that UAVs first exchange control packets in control window to select data channels and to align beams before exchanging data packets in the data window. In this way, the hidden-terminal and deafness problems are reduced. UAVs can reserve channels and align beams through a circular directional transmission of control frames so that the protocol can take advantage of the benefits of retro-directive array antennas of spatial reuse and increased coverage without prior knowledge of the locations. We develop both antenna model and channel model for FA-MMAC protocol. Analysis and simulation results show that our proposed FA-MMAC can offer a significant performance gain for both static and mobile scenarios than the existing MMAC and 802.11-based protocols. Our findings reported in this paper provide some insights into the performance of multi-channel Flying Ad Hoc Networks which might help network researchers to contribute in the development of next generation UAVs.  © 1967-2012 IEEE.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85100488235&doi=10.1109%2fTVT.2021.3054646&partnerID=40&md5=7722cce05d20a3d390a895633dddd668,IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology,2021
On the Design of Mutual Authentication and Key Agreement Protocol in Internet of Vehicles-Enabled Intelligent Transportation System,"Internet of Vehicles (IoV), a distributed network involving connected vehicles and Vehicular Ad Hoc Networks (VANETs), allows connected vehicles to communicate with other Internet-connected entities in real time. The communications among these entities (e.g. vehicles, pedestrians, fleet management systems, and road-side infrastructure) generally take place via an open channel. In other words, such an open communication can be targeted by the adversary to eavesdrop, modify, insert fabricated (or malicious) messages, or delete any data-in-transit; thus, resulting in replay, impersonation, man-in-the-middle, privileged-insider, and other related attacks. In addition to security, anonymity and untraceability are two other important features that should be achieved in an authentication protocol. In this paper, we propose a new mutual authentication and key agreement protocol in an IoV-enabled Intelligent Transportation System (ITS). Using both formal and informal security analysis, as well as formal security verification using an automated verification tool, we show that the proposed scheme is secure against several known attacks in an IoV-enabled ITS environment. Furthermore, a detailed comparative analysis shows that the proposed scheme has low communication and computational overheads, and offers better security and functionality attributes in comparison to seven other competing schemes. We also evaluate the performance of the proposed scheme using NS2.  © 1967-2012 IEEE.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85099575577&doi=10.1109%2fTVT.2021.3050614&partnerID=40&md5=a24f9ceb5c2709026a146e43c1c0b800,IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology,2021
Dynamic Aerial Base Station Placement for Minimum-Delay Communications,"Queuing delay is of essential importance in the Internet-of-Things scenarios where the buffer sizes of devices are limited. The existing cross-layer research contributions aiming at minimizing the queuing delay usually rely on either transmit power control or dynamic spectrum allocation. Bearing in mind that the transmission throughput is dependent on the distance between the transmitter and the receiver, in this context we exploit the agility of the unmanned-aerial-vehicle (UAV)-mounted base stations (BSs) for proactively adjusting the aerial BS (ABS)'s placement in accordance with wireless teletraffic dynamics. Specifically, we formulate a minimum-delay ABS placement problem for UAV-enabled networks, subject to realistic constraints on the ABS's battery life and velocity. Its solutions are technically realized under three different assumptions in regard to the wireless teletraffic dynamics. The backward induction technique is invoked for both the scenario where the full knowledge of the wireless teletraffic dynamics is available, and for the case where only their statistical knowledge is available. In contrast, a reinforcement learning aided approach is invoked for the case when neither the exact number of arriving packets nor that of their statistical knowledge is available. The numerical results demonstrate that our proposed algorithms are capable of improving the system's performance compared to the benchmark schemes in terms of both the average delay and of the buffer overflow probability.  © 2014 IEEE.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85100241738&doi=10.1109%2fJIOT.2020.3013752&partnerID=40&md5=e49042f1ec152716f3e41c6c099477b0,IEEE Internet of Things Journal,2021
Modeling Data Redundancy and Cost-Aware Task Allocation in MEC-Enabled Internet-of-Vehicles Applications,"Multiaccess edge computing (MEC) enables autonomous vehicles to handle time-critical and data-intensive computational tasks for emerging Internet-of-Vehicles (IoV) applications via computation offloading. However, a massive amount of data generated by colocated vehicles is typically redundant, introducing a critical issue due to limited network bandwidth. Moreover, on the edge server side, these computation-intensive tasks further impose severe pressure on the resource-finite MEC server, resulting in low-performance efficiency of applications. To solve these challenges, we model the data redundancy and collaborative task computing scheme to efficiently reduce the redundant data and utilize the idle resources in nearby MEC servers. First, the data redundancy problem is formulated as a set-covering problem according to the spatiotemporal coverage of captured images. Next, we exploit the submodular optimization technique to design an efficient algorithm to minimize the number of images transferred to the MEC servers without degrading the quality of IoV applications. To facilitate the task execution in the MEC server, we then propose a collaborative task computing scheme, where an MEC server intentionally encourages nearby resource-rich MEC servers to participate in a collaborative computing group. Accordingly, a cost model is formulated as an optimization problem, the objective of which is to prompt the MEC server to judiciously allocate computing tasks to nearby MEC servers with the goal of achieving the minimal cost while the latency of tasks is guaranteed. Experimental results show that the proposed scheme can efficiently mitigate data redundancy, conserve network bandwidth consumption, and achieve the lowest cost for processing tasks.  © 2014 IEEE.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85099577475&doi=10.1109%2fJIOT.2020.3015534&partnerID=40&md5=dad27c16b780b2ba7915527d27232f9a,IEEE Internet of Things Journal,2021
"Edge Learning with Unmanned Ground Vehicle: Joint Path, Energy, and Sample Size Planning","Edge learning (EL), which uses edge computing as a platform to execute machine learning algorithms, is able to fully exploit the massive sensing data generated by Internet of Things (IoT). However, due to the limited transmit power at IoT devices, collecting the sensing data in EL systems is a challenging task. To address this challenge, this article proposes to integrate unmanned ground vehicle (UGV) with EL. With such a scheme, the UGV could improve the communication quality by approaching various IoT devices. However, different devices may transmit different data for different machine learning jobs and a fundamental question is how to jointly plan the UGV path, the devices' energy consumption, and the number of samples for different jobs? This article further proposes a graph-based path planning model, a network energy consumption model, and a sample size planning model that characterizes F-measure as a function of the minority class sample size. With these models, the joint path, energy and sample size planning (JPESP) problem is formulated as a large-scale mixed-integer nonlinear programming (MINLP) problem, which is nontrivial to solve due to the high-dimensional discontinuous variables related to UGV movement. To this end, it is proved that each IoT device should be served only once along the path, thus the problem dimension is significantly reduced. Furthermore, to handle the discontinuous variables, a tabu search (TS)-based algorithm is derived, which converges in expectation to the optimal solution to the JPESP problem. Simulation results under different task scenarios show that our optimization schemes outperform the fixed EL and the full path EL schemes. © 2014 IEEE.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85100812632&doi=10.1109%2fJIOT.2020.3023000&partnerID=40&md5=4e2031ab41c46025dafc6b0c1cccce02,IEEE Internet of Things Journal,2021
A system-theoretic approach to safety and security co-analysis of autonomous ships,"The autonomous ship carrying valuable cargoes and passengers in a more effective and cost-saving manner will soon be state of the art technology, which most likely shall be introduced into the public horizon as the remote control mode within the foreseeable future.

To smooth this innovative system can be released into actual context of operation, a novel STPA-based methodology is proposed that synthesizes safety and security, namely STPA-SynSS. In the novel method, a comprehensive process to identifying hazards and revealing causal factors is provided, hazard elimination/mitigation strategies are implemented into system design via system safety and security requirements, so that hazards can be continually tracked and closed-loop managed. The insight regards the operations of the method was demonstrated in a remotely-controlled ship with seafarers onboard, the analysis process focused on encountering ship-ship collision accidents and related security incidents. Results indicate that generated inadvertent/intentional causal factors and developed elimination/mitigation strategies can assist the processes of design and operational planning of the autonomous ships and its shore control centre.

Visible Light Communication Based Vehicle Localization for Collision Avoidance and Platooning,"Collision avoidance and platooning applications require vehicle localization at cm-level accuracy and at least 50 Hz rate for full autonomy. The RADAR/LIDAR and camera based methods currently used for vehicle localization do not satisfy these requirements, necessitating complementary technologies. Visible light positioning (VLP) is a highly suitable complementary technology due to its high accuracy and high rate, exploiting the line-of-sight propagation feature of the visible light communication (VLC) signals from LED head/tail lights. However, existing vehicular VLP algorithms impose restrictive requirements, e.g., use of high-bandwidth circuits, road-side lights and certain VLC modulation strategies, and work for limited relative vehicle orientations, thus, are not feasible for general use. This paper proposes a VLC-based vehicle localization method that eliminates these restrictive requirements by a novel VLC receiver design and associated vehicular VLP algorithm. The VLC receiver, named QRX, is low-cost/size, and enables high-rate VLC and high-accuracy angle-of-arrival (AoA) measurement, simultaneously, via the usage of a quadrant photodiode. The VLP algorithm estimates the positions of two head/tail light VLC transmitters (TX) on a neighbouring vehicle by using AoA measurements from two QRXs for localization. The algorithm is theoretically analyzed by deriving its Cramer-Rao lower bound on positioning accuracy, and simulated localization performance is evaluated under realistic platooning and collision avoidance scenarios. Results demonstrate that the proposed method performs at cm-level accuracy and up to 250 Hz rate within a 10 m range under realistic harsh road and channel conditions, demonstrating its eligibility for collision avoidance and safe platooning. © 1967-2012 IEEE.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85101743077&doi=10.1109%2fTVT.2021.3061512&partnerID=40&md5=6c304d23760fa6f551b5747460687956,IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology,2021
A Secure Adaptive Control for Cooperative Driving of Autonomous Connected Vehicles in the Presence of Heterogeneous Communication Delays and Cyberattacks,"The development of autonomous connected vehicles, moving as a platoon formation, is a hot topic in the intelligent transportation system (ITS) research field. It is on the road and deployment requires the design of distributed control strategies, leveraging secure vehicular ad-hoc networks (VANETs). Indeed, wireless communication networks can be affected by various security vulnerabilities and cyberattacks leading to dangerous implications for cooperative driving safety. Control design can play an important role in providing both resilience and robustness to vehicular networks. To this aim, in this article, we tackle and solve the problem of cyber-secure tracking for a platoon that moves as a cohesive formation along a single lane undergoing different kinds of cyber threats, that is, application layer and network layer attacks, as well as network induced phenomena. The proposed cooperative approach leverages an adaptive synchronization-based control algorithm that embeds a distributed mitigation mechanism of malicious information. The closed-loop stability is analytically demonstrated by using the Lyapunov-Krasovskii theory, while its effectiveness in coping with the most relevant type of cyber threats is disclosed by using PLEXE, a high fidelity simulator which provides a realistic simulation of cooperative driving systems.  © 2013 IEEE.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85101130880&doi=10.1109%2fTCYB.2019.2962601&partnerID=40&md5=a14cd8a99ce2b82177cb4c4691b2fa6d,IEEE Transactions on Cybernetics,2021
Space Pruning Based Time Minimization in Delay Constrained Multi-Task UAV-Based Sensing,"Due to the inherent mobility and enhanced communication capability of the unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV), it is foreseen that effective UAV-based sensing schemes can achieve faster deployment and flexible observation as compared to the traditional fixed sensing systems. In many sensing applications, multiple geographically distributed tasks need to be executed while satisfying a stringent requirement on the transmission delay of the sensory data, especially for the time-critical sensing tasks, such as disaster rescue and environment monitoring. To minimize the overall mission completion time in such delay constrained multi-task UAV-based sensing applications, it is imperative to properly design the inter-task trajectory, the UAV-BS association, and the sensing order. Nonetheless, finding the optimal sensing scheme is highly non-trivial since these three sub-problems are tightly coupled and involve non-convex constraints. To overcome these challenges, firstly, a novel space pruning based trajectory search (SPTS) algorithm is proposed by exploiting the geometric characteristics of the optimal inter-task UAV trajectory, which can achieve a substantially faster convergence as compared to the Ployblock algorithm. Secondly, a novel optimal UAV-BS association (OUBA) algorithm is presented to quickly identify the best BS for each sensing task. Thirdly, by combining these two proposed algorithms with the Lin-Kernighan-Helsgaun (LKH) algorithm, a lower bound of the mission completion time can be efficiently computed and a near-optimal solution can be obtained. Numerical simulations demonstrate that significant performance improvement can be achieved by the proposed scheme. © 1967-2012 IEEE.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85101756120&doi=10.1109%2fTVT.2021.3061243&partnerID=40&md5=44ef37470dfb168cfbf8eb2bb43f66c4,IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology,2021
INS/Odometer Land Navigation by Accurate Measurement Modeling and Multiple-Model Adaptive Estimation,"Land vehicle navigation based on the inertial navigation system (INS) and odometers (ODs) is a classical autonomous navigation application and has been extensively studied over the past several decades. In this article, we seriously analyze the error characteristics of the OD pulses and investigate three types of OD measurement models in the INS/OD integrated system. Specifically, in the pulse velocity model, a preliminary Kalman filter is designed to obtain an accurate vehicle velocity from the accumulated pulses; the pulse increment model is accordingly obtained by integrating the pulse velocity; a new pulse accumulation model is proposed by augmenting the traveled distance into the system state. The three types of measurements, along with the nonholonomic constraint, are implemented in the standard extended Kalman filter. In view of the motion-related pulse error characteristics, the multiple model adaptive estimation (MMAE) approach is exploited to further enhance the performance. Simulations and long-distance experiments are conducted to verify the feasibility and effectiveness of the proposed methods. It is shown that the standard pulse velocity measurement achieves superior performance, whereas the accumulated pulse measurement is most favorable with the MMAE enhancement. © 1965-2011 IEEE.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85089292585&doi=10.1109%2fTAES.2020.3011998&partnerID=40&md5=436c82178b949d7db24563f3527f3505,IEEE Transactions on Aerospace and Electronic Systems,2021
Adaptive and Optimum Secret Key Establishment for Secure Vehicular Communications,"In intelligent transportation systems (ITS), communications between vehicles, i.e. vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) communications are of greatest importance to facilitate autonomous driving. The current state-of-the-art for secure data exchange in V2V communications relies on public-key cryptography (PKC) consuming significant computational and energy resources for the encryption/decryption process and large bandwidth for the key distribution. To overcome these limitations, physical-layer security (PLS) has emerged as a lightweight solution by exploiting the physical characteristics of the V2V communication channel to generate symmetric cryptographic keys. Currently, key-generation algorithms are designed via empirical parameter settings, without resulting in optimum key-generation performance. In this paper, we devise a key-generation algorithm for PLS in V2V communications by introducing a novel channel response quantisation method that results in optimum performance via analytical parameter settings. Contrary to the current state-of-the-art, the channel responses incorporate all V2V channel attributes that contribute to temporal variability, such as three dimensional (3D) scattering and scatterers' mobility. An extra functionality, namely, Perturbe-Observe (PO), is further incorporated that enables the algorithm to adapt to the inherent non-reciprocity of the V2V channel responses at the legitimate entities. Optimum performance is evidenced via maximisation of the key bit generation rate (BGR) and key entropy (H) and minimisation of the key bit mismatch rate (BMR). A new metric is further introduced, the so-called secret-bit generation rate (SBGR), as the ratio of the number of bits which are successfully used to compose keys to the total amount of channel samples. SBGR unifies BGR and BMR and is thus maximised by the proposed algorithmic process. © 1967-2012 IEEE.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85100746285&doi=10.1109%2fTVT.2021.3056638&partnerID=40&md5=91ca9738c33539fb8de69f1aa53a9b45,IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology,2021
Aerial Visual Perception in Smart Farming: Field Study of Wheat Yellow Rust Monitoring,"Agriculture is facing severe challenges from crop stresses, threatening its sustainable development and food security. This article exploits aerial visual perception for yellow rust disease monitoring, which seamlessly integrates state-of-the-art techniques and algorithms, including unmanned aerial vehicle sensing, multispectral imaging, vegetation segmentation, and deep learning U-Net. A field experiment is designed by infecting winter wheat with yellow rust inoculum, on top of which multispectral aerial images are captured by DJI Matrice 100 equipped with RedEdge camera. After image calibration and stitching, multispectral orthomosaic is labeled for system evaluation by inspecting high-resolution RGB images taken by Parrot Anafi Drone. The merits of the developed framework drawing spectral-spatial information concurrently are demonstrated by showing improved performance over purely spectral-based classifier by the classical random forest algorithm. Moreover, various network input band combinations are tested, including three RGB bands and five selected spectral vegetation indices, by sequential forward selection strategy of wrapper algorithm.  © 2005-2012 IEEE.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85097709443&doi=10.1109%2fTII.2020.2979237&partnerID=40&md5=aecb9e166239938235387e2910d5655f,IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics,2021
"Deep Multi-Modal Object Detection and Semantic Segmentation for Autonomous Driving: Datasets, Methods, and Challenges","Recent advancements in perception for autonomous driving are driven by deep learning. In order to achieve robust and accurate scene understanding, autonomous vehicles are usually equipped with different sensors (e.g. cameras, LiDARs, Radars), and multiple sensing modalities can be fused to exploit their complementary properties. In this context, many methods have been proposed for deep multi-modal perception problems. However, there is no general guideline for network architecture design, and questions of 'what to fuse', 'when to fuse', and 'how to fuse' remain open. This review paper attempts to systematically summarize methodologies and discuss challenges for deep multi-modal object detection and semantic segmentation in autonomous driving. To this end, we first provide an overview of on-board sensors on test vehicles, open datasets, and background information for object detection and semantic segmentation in autonomous driving research. We then summarize the fusion methodologies and discuss challenges and open questions. In the appendix, we provide tables that summarize topics and methods. We also provide an interactive online platform to navigate each reference: https://boschresearch.github.io/multimodalperception/.  © 2000-2011 IEEE.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85102472460&doi=10.1109%2fTITS.2020.2972974&partnerID=40&md5=e2bf9253ec8af465f6f6b179863d2259,IEEE Transactions on Intelligent Transportation Systems,2021
Anomaly Monitoring Framework in Lane Detection with a Generative Adversarial Network,"The safety of an automated vehicle requires accurate information of surrounding conditions, because a false sensor output can lead to a fatal accident during driving. Thus, monitoring of abnormalities in every sensor is important for robust perception of the environment. Since it is difficult to obtain anomalous data, it is hard to develop a robust detection algorithm using only a relatively small number of anomalies. In this paper, we propose a data augmentation method for oversampling minority anomalies in lane detection. Using a generative adversarial network that makes the generator learn to estimate the distribution of anomalous data, it generates synthesized minority anomalies. The generated anomalies are used to train an anomaly detection network while minimizing latency for use in real situations. During training, the generated anomalies, with various mixed quality, are sampled differently according to their quality. This helps the detection network to be optimized with better quality data. Experimental result shows that when using the proposed anomaly detection framework for monitoring lane abnormality, it improves the performance by 12% when compared to the vanilla recurrent neural network.  © 2000-2011 IEEE.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85102445082&doi=10.1109%2fTITS.2020.2973398&partnerID=40&md5=4647592e9f0aba00bb25cfada970a73e,IEEE Transactions on Intelligent Transportation Systems,2021
Multi-Source Adversarial Sample Attack on Autonomous Vehicles,"Deep learning has an impressive performance of object detection and classification for autonomous vehicles. Nevertheless, the essential vulnerability of deep learning models to adversarial samples makes the autonomous vehicles suffer severe security and safety issues. Although a number of works have been proposed to study adversarial samples, only a few of them are designated for the scenario of autonomous vehicles. Moreover, the state-of-the-art attack models only focus on a single data source without considering the correlation among multiple data sources. To fill this blank, we propose two multi-source adversarial sample attack models, including the parallel attack model and the fusion attack model to simultaneously attack the image and LiDAR perception systems in the autonomous vehicles. In the parallel attack model, adversarial samples are generated from the original image and LiDAR data separately. In the fusion attack model, the adversarial samples of image and LiDAR can be generated from a low-dimension vector at the same time by fully exploring data correlation for data fusion and adversarial sample generation. Through comprehensive real-data experiments, we validate that our proposed models are more powerful and efficient to break down the perception systems of autonomous vehicles compared with the state-of-the-art. Furthermore, we simulate possible attack scenarios in Vehicular Ad hoc Networks (VANETs) to evaluate the attack performance of our proposed methods. © 1967-2012 IEEE.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85101755068&doi=10.1109%2fTVT.2021.3061065&partnerID=40&md5=8bf1daf9feee4f5cefc0540ec0357770,IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology,2021
Fault Detection Filter and Controller Co-Design for Unmanned Surface Vehicles under DoS Attacks,"This paper addresses the co-design problem of a fault detection filter and controller for a networked-based unmanned surface vehicle (USV) system subject to communication delays, external disturbance, faults, and aperiodic denial-of-service (DoS) jamming attacks. First, an event-triggering communication scheme is proposed to enhance the efficiency of network resource utilization while counteracting the impact of aperiodic DoS attacks on the USV control system performance. Second, an event-based switched USV control system is presented to account for the simultaneous presence of communication delays, disturbance, faults, and DoS jamming attacks. Third, by using the piecewise Lyapunov functional (PLF) approach, criteria for exponential stability analysis and co-design of a desired observer-based fault detection filter and an event-triggered controller are derived and expressed in terms of linear matrix inequalities (LMIs). Finally, the simulation results verify the effectiveness of the proposed co-design method. The results show that this method not only ensures the safe and stable operation of the USV but also reduces the amount of data transmissions. © 2000-2011 IEEE.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85101183106&doi=10.1109%2fTITS.2020.2970472&partnerID=40&md5=457750e34fb8327a3098ec5195f5aac1,IEEE Transactions on Intelligent Transportation Systems,2021
End-to-End Autonomous Driving Risk Analysis: A Behavioural Anomaly Detection Approach,"Autonomous vehicles (AV) have advanced considerably over the past decade and their potential to reduce road accidents is without equal. That said, the evolution towards fully automated driving will be accompanied by new and unfamiliar risks. The deployment of AVs hinges on the premise that they are considerably safer than human drivers. However, the ability of manufacturers, insurers and regulators to quantifiably demonstrate this risk reduction, relative to humans, presents a major barrier. Based on accident rates, it will likely take hundreds of millions of autonomous miles to derive statistically meaningful results. This paper addresses this issue and proposes a novel means of quantifying AV accident risks by benchmarking against a more familiar and quantifiable risk - Human Behaviour. This method is used to proactively quantify AV safety relative to human drivers. Currently, anomalous driving behaviour stems from human susceptibilities such as fatigue or aggression. We exploit this observation and explore AV driving behaviour where driving anomalies are symptoms of technology errors. The comparative behaviours of AV and safe human driving can be used to measure AV accident risk. An end-to-end model AV is simulated using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) to compare human and AV driving behaviours. Using a machine learning technique called Gaussian Processes (GP), contextual driving anomalies are detected, the frequency and severity of which are used to derive a risk score. This paper offers a starting point for addressing the challenges surrounding AV risk modelling.  © 2000-2011 IEEE.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85102422551&doi=10.1109%2fTITS.2020.2975043&partnerID=40&md5=155ce001657a4c2b54da6a0234060bc3,IEEE Transactions on Intelligent Transportation Systems,2021
Targeted Attention Attack on Deep Learning Models in Road Sign Recognition,"Real-world traffic sign recognition is an important step toward building autonomous vehicles, most of which highly dependent on deep neural networks (DNNs). Recent studies demonstrated that DNNs are surprisingly susceptible to adversarial examples. Many attack methods have been proposed to understand and generate adversarial examples, such as gradient-based attack, score-based attack, decision-based attack, and transfer-based attacks. However, most of these algorithms are ineffective in real-world road sign attack, because 1) iteratively learning perturbations for each frame is not realistic for a fast moving car and 2) most optimization algorithms traverse all pixels equally without considering their diverse contribution. To alleviate these problems, this article proposes the targeted attention attack (TAA) method for real-world road sign attack. Specifically, we have made the following contributions: 1) we leverage the soft attention map to highlight those important pixels and skip those zero-contributed areas-This also helps to generate natural perturbations; 2) we design an efficient universal attack that optimizes a single perturbation/noise based on a set of training images under the guidance of the pretrained attention map; 3) we design a simple objective function that can be easily optimized; and 4) we evaluate the effectiveness of TAA on real-world data sets. Experimental results validate that the TAA method improves the attack successful rate (nearly 10%) and reduces the perturbation loss (about a quarter) compared with the popular RP2 method. Additionally, our TAA also provides good properties, e.g., transferability and generalization capability.

Full-Duplex UAV Relaying for Multiple User Pairs,"Based on the advantages of small size, lightweight, as well as flexible deployment and recycling, unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) has been more and more widely used in military and civilian. As flying relays, UAVs can quickly set up relay communication links for different missions, to enhance the receiving signal power, increase the system capacity, and expand the communication coverage. In this article, we investigate full-duplex (FD) UAV relaying for multiple source-destination pairs. To fully exploit the flying flexibility of the UAV in serving multiple source-destination pairs, we propose a scheduling protocol that exploits time-division multiple access (TDMA) to serve different source-destination pairs in turns when flying along an optimized trajectory. Then, we further formulate a joint optimization problem of the TDMA-based user scheduling, the dynamic UAV trajectory, and the UAV transmit power to maximize the system throughput. The formulated problem is nonconvex that makes it difficult to solve directly, hence we propose an iterative algorithm to obtain an approximate optimal solution based on block coordinate descent and successive convex optimization techniques. Simulation results demonstrate that our proposed FD-based UAV relaying network achieves significant throughput gains compared with the half-duplex (HD) baseline, and the TDMA-based protocol outperforms the OFDMA-based ones with fixed UAV position/trajectory when the UAV helps relay information for multiple source-destination pairs. © 2014 IEEE.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85102334121&doi=10.1109%2fJIOT.2020.3027621&partnerID=40&md5=e131b7fd05a20b8fd95006c5d176aa38,IEEE Internet of Things Journal,2021
A Machine-Learning-Based Data-Centric Misbehavior Detection Model for Internet of Vehicles,"The Internet of Things (IoT) boosts road safety, efficiency, and infotainment by connecting vehicles to form the Internet of Vehicles (IoV). Specifically to safety, IoV complements autonomous cars beyond sensors' line-of-sight, facilitating vehicle-To-vehicle (V2V) communications in a smart transportation environment. The correctness of data exchanged among vehicles is paramount to ensure vehicles behave as per norms. Traditional misbehavior detection methods hardly defend vehicular security effectively due to rapid dynamics and location privacy. In particular, those node-centric classifiers become ill-fit in IoV. This work proposes a data-centric misbehavior detection model based on supervised machine learning (ML). The work also integrates plausibility checks with ML techniques and instantiates the model with six algorithms to demonstrate their comparative effectiveness. In addition to misbehavior detection, the model classifies attack types to support validating countermeasures. Specifically, the work analyzes the supervised learning algorithms for detecting misbehavior in IoV, compares their performance, and identifies their limitations. VeReMi, a vehicle-To-everything (V2X) position forgery attack built-in simulated road traffic data set, is used to test the effectiveness of the proposed model. The performance metrics include precision-recall (PR) and receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves. The results demonstrate the effectiveness and significance of ML to detect misbehavior in IoV. The addition of plausibility checks improves the precision and recall by 5% and 2%, respectively. © 2014 IEEE.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85098792167&doi=10.1109%2fJIOT.2020.3035035&partnerID=40&md5=cd6b8d30b5b79b81ab6a50f77b9ff9d0,IEEE Internet of Things Journal,2021
Attention Based Vehicle Trajectory Prediction,"Self-driving vehicles need to continuously analyse the driving scene, understand the behavior of other road users and predict their future trajectories in order to plan a safe motion and reduce their reaction time. Motivated by this idea, this paper addresses the problem of vehicle trajectory prediction over an extended horizon. On highways, human drivers continuously adapt their speed and paths according to the behavior of their neighboring vehicles. Therefore, vehicles' trajectories are very correlated and considering vehicle interactions makes motion prediction possible even before the start of a clear maneuver pattern. To this end, we introduce and analyze trajectory prediction methods based on how they model the vehicles interactions. Inspired by human reasoning, we use an attention mechanism that explicitly highlights the importance of neighboring vehicles with respect to their future states. We go beyond pairwise vehicle interactions and model higher order interactions. Moreover, the existence of different goals and driving behaviors induces multiple potential futures. We exploit a combination of global and partial attention paid to surrounding vehicles to generate different possible trajectory. Experiments on highway datasets show that the proposed model outperforms the state-of-the-art performances. © 2016 IEEE.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85084218362&doi=10.1109%2fTIV.2020.2991952&partnerID=40&md5=61577af809f7cd029e25272871ed623f,IEEE Transactions on Intelligent Vehicles,2021
Joint UAV Position and Power Optimization for Accurate Regional Localization in Space-Air Integrated Localization Network,"Accurate location estimation of Internet-of-Things (IoT) devices within an Area of Interest (AoI) is a challenging issue, especially in a global navigation satellite system (GNSS)-constrained environment. In this article, we present a space-Air integrated localization network (SAILN) architecture to exploit the advantages of the unmanned-Aerial-vehicle (UAV)-based localization through joint position and power optimization (JPPO) strategies. In SAILN, UAVs can utilize their flexible movement to obtain the line-of-sight (LOS) path with a high probability, thereby providing the potential IoT devices in the AoI with supplementary localization information. The JPPO of UAVs aims to improve the regional localization accuracy for the entire AoI, considering the no-fly-zone (NFZ) and the total energy constraint. We propose the average localization accuracy increment (ALAI) of the sampling points in the AoI as the metric to measure the performance of SAILN compared with that of only satellites, which is regarded as the objective to formulate the JPPO problems for UAV operations in both static and dynamic SAILN. The intractable problems can be resolved by the pure genetic algorithm (PGA) that has a low computational cost and unique features suiting the JPPO of UAVs. Then, by taking advantage of the ALAI convexity to the UAVs' power, we propose a power reallocation-based two-step algorithm (PRTSA) to further explore an improved JPPO solution. Simulation results validate that the proposed PRTSA can obtain a higher localization accuracy for the entire AoI than the PGA and the other straightforward baselines. © 2014 IEEE.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85102385949&doi=10.1109%2fJIOT.2020.3030064&partnerID=40&md5=89cac69aedb8b4f8c81c29975c9538f9,IEEE Internet of Things Journal,2021
IoT-Ready Energy-Autonomous Parking Sensor Device,"Finding a free parking lot contributes largely to a total traffic congestion and increases gas emissions in urban and overpopulated cities. Recent advances in smart parking systems adopt Internet of Things (IoT) concepts which tend to improve traffic bottlenecks by providing information about available parking lots. The detection of vehicle presence at the parking lot usually means adopting solutions comprised of power-hungry and battery-operated sensor devices. In this article a hardware-based approach is introduced which aims at building a self-powered and autonomous sensing node equipped with supercapacitors (battery less) to feel the vehicle presence. For purposes of detection, solar-based energy harvester and wake-up trigger prototype is considered along with a Bluetooth low-energy (BLE) radio. The joint use of such technologies is exploited to develop a power autonomous node capable of cost-effectively sensing the car presence and transmitting the parking lot status. The developed triggering system consumes only 150 nA making it suitable as a low-power solution. To initiate the trigger only 6.5 W/m2 in light level change is required comparing the two panels, which is more than adequate as the comparison of solar irradiance measured under the vehicle against diffuse horizontal irradiance shows a significant difference. The developed prototype uses a magnetometer to verify the vehicle presence upon trigger generation and BLE 5.0 technology for status change update, while supercapacitor discharge lifetime duration is estimated to be around 13 days in harsh conditions without charging from solar cells. © 2014 IEEE.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85102384694&doi=10.1109%2fJIOT.2020.3031088&partnerID=40&md5=7595a9c405bfad07625dc1a1c9e214e4,IEEE Internet of Things Journal,2021
An Adaptive Priority Allocation for Formation UAVs in Complex Context,"A novel passing priority allocation method, based on the collision avoidance urgency, used for a formation of UAVs in a serried obstacle laden environment, is presented in this article. The method employs the collision cone and the prediction of the collision time to evaluate the urgency of imminent collision of each UAV, so as to establish a primary criterion for the priority allocation. And, the priority update policy is also innovative designed to alleviate burdens on the instability of frequent shifty context. This article exploits the potential field in a cooperative way to plan the path for each UAV, steering the UAVs to a given 3-D position, which combines the adaptive priorities to guide the UAVs passing through the barriers in turn. Numerical simulations and semi-physical experiments in designed outdoor condition are carried out to compare the performance of the proposed adaptive priorities with the regular-used default priorities. The total passing time and the energy cost of the semi-physical tests provide the promising validation in terms of the efficiency and superiority of the proposed method. © 1965-2011 IEEE.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85096149885&doi=10.1109%2fTAES.2020.3034016&partnerID=40&md5=2142e2c3141012b107cdaba38841ba10,IEEE Transactions on Aerospace and Electronic Systems,2021
Adaptive Square Attack: Fooling Autonomous Cars with Adversarial Traffic Signs,"To better understand the road condition and make correct driving decisions, traffic sign recognition becomes a crucial component commonly equipped in the vision system of modern autonomous cars. The state-of-the-art traffic sign recognition models are designed with the backbones of deep neural networks (DNNs) since DNNs are powerful to extract more effective visual features that benefit recognition performance. As the recent studies on adversarial attacks have shown that DNNs are easy to be fooled by perturbed images and lead to misclassification, in this article, we explore the vulnerability of the DNN-based traffic sign recognition model. Most existing adversarial attack methods limitedly focus on the white-box attack on the recognition models whose underlying configurations (e.g., network architectures and parameters) are accessible. Differently, we propose a novel attacking method dubbed adaptive square attack (ASA) that can accomplish the black-box attack, i.e., bypassing the access the configurations of the recognition models. Specifically, the proposed ASA method employs an efficient sampling strategy that can generate perturbations for traffic sign images with fewer query times. Extensive experiments on the benchmark data set German traffic sign recognition benchmark with large-scale traffic sign images for autonomous cars show that our proposed ASA method is advanced to perform the black-box attack with high efficiency. Although the generated adversarial traffic sign images by the proposed ASA method are visually similar to the raw images with almost imperceptible differences, they can successfully lead to the misclassification of the state-of-the-art recognition model.  © 2014 IEEE.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85104075516&doi=10.1109%2fJIOT.2020.3016145&partnerID=40&md5=a6faba4e0845a23927fd56c90efc2952,IEEE Internet of Things Journal,2021
Cooperative Intelligent Transport Systems: Choreography-Based Urban Traffic Coordination,"With the emerging connected automated vehicles, 5G and Internet of Things (IoT), vehicles and road infrastructure become connected and cooperative, enabling Cooperative Intelligent Transport Systems (C-ITS). C-ITS are transport system of systems that involves many stakeholders from different sectors. While running their own systems and providing services independently, stakeholders cooperate with each other for improving the overall transport performance such as safety, efficiency and sustainability. Massive information on road and traffic is already available and provided through standard services with different protocols. By reusing and composing the available heterogeneous services, novel value-added applications can be developed. This paper introduces a choreography-based service composition platform, i.e. the CHOReVOLUTION Integrated Development and Runtime Environment (IDRE), and it reports on how the IDRE has been successfully exploited to accelerate the reuse-based development of a choreography-based Urban Traffic Coordination (UTC) application. The UTC application takes the shape of eco-driving services that through real-time eco-route evaluation assist the drivers for the most eco-friendly and comfortable driving experience. The eco-driving services are realized through choreography and they are exploited through a mobile app for online navigation. From specification to deployment to execution, the CHOReVOLUTION IDRE has been exploited to support the realization of the UTC application by automatizing the generation of the distributed logic to properly bind, coordinate and adapt the interactions of the involved parties. The benefits brought by CHOReVOLUTION IDRE have been assessed through the evaluation of a set of Key Performance Indicators (KPIs). © 2000-2011 IEEE.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85101755202&doi=10.1109%2fTITS.2021.3059394&partnerID=40&md5=e85332db3b6fed766dd4c66f9b0e776e,IEEE Transactions on Intelligent Transportation Systems,2021
Vehicle Trajectory Prediction Using Generative Adversarial Network with Temporal Logic Syntax Tree Features,"In this work, we propose a novel approach for integrating rules into traffic agent trajectory prediction. Consideration of rules is important for understanding how people behave-yet, it cannot be assumed that rules are always followed. To address this challenge, we evaluate different approaches of integrating rules as inductive biases into deep learning-based prediction models. We propose a framework based on generative adversarial networks that uses tools from formal methods, namely signal temporal logic and syntax trees. This allows us to leverage information on rule obedience as features in neural networks and improves prediction accuracy without biasing towards lawful behavior.

Stability analysis for design improvement of bio-inspired flapping wings by energy method,"This study attempts to reach a broad understanding of the stability properties of nonlinear time-periodic flapping wing structures. Two bio-system models, Hummingbird (6DOF) and Hawkmoth (3DOF) are developed for this purpose. Initial analysis on the Hummingbird model, which is based on the Floquet theory, kinetic energy integration, and phase portrait technique, indicates lack of stability in hover flight. Kinetic energy integration is carried out on the extended model of the Hawkmoth to find the domain of attraction and increase the level of stability by varying the design parameters. Here, the hinge location of the wing, flapping amplitude, flapping frequency, and mean angle of attack are adjusted to achieve steady hovering trim condition. The results will be used for hovering control design that is a problem with no clear solution and has been widely studied based on linear analysis and averaging theory regardless of the stability properties. In addition, by averaging theory and linearization technique, the range of mean angle of attack that is associated with the pitch angle is also determined by using eigenvalues to achieve dynamic stability for further nonlinear analysis. Sensitivity analysis is then performed with the phase portrait and energy approach on the equivalent dynamics to reach the main cause of instability. Improved parameters are applied to the non-autonomous dynamics, and for the first time, the creation of a strange attractor is observed in three-dimensional phase space by Floquet analysis. © 2021 Elsevier Masson SAS",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85100824058&doi=10.1016%2fj.ast.2021.106558&partnerID=40&md5=7ed8cd6614d5fdcee926d65bb7f66637,Aerospace Science and Technology,2021
Systematic Assessment of Cyber-Physical Security of Energy Management System for Connected and Automated Electric Vehicles,"In this article, a systematic assessment of cyber-physical security on the energy management system for connected and automated electric vehicles is proposed, which, to our knowledge, has not been attempted before. The generalized methodology of impact analysis of cyber attacks is developed, including novel evaluation metrics from the perspectives of steady state and transient performance of the energy management system and innovative index-based resilience and security criteria. Specifically, we propose a security criterion in terms of dynamic performance, comfortability, and energy, which are the most critical metrics to evaluate the performance of an electronic control unit (ECU). If an attack does not impact these metrics, it perhaps can be negligible. Based on the statistical results and the proposed evaluation metrics, the impact of cyber attacks on ECU is analyzed comprehensively. The conclusions can serve as guidelines for attack detection, diagnosis, and countermeasures. © 2005-2012 IEEE.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85101757741&doi=10.1109%2fTII.2020.3011821&partnerID=40&md5=1b25b8ea43541b6897ab8cf312272670,IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics,2021
Performance estimation for Kalman filter based multi-agent cooperative navigation by employing graph theory,"Cooperative Navigation (CN) exploits inter-agent relative measurement and communication to achieve navigation performance improvement. This technique has attracted worldwide interest in many multi-agent (e.g., multiple unmanned air vehicles) applications, due to its significant advantage over non-cooperative approaches. Comparing to prior studies which mainly focused on performance analysis under a fixed CN framework, this work aims at establishing the theoretical basis to quantify the navigation performance for different CN integration architectures. Two graph variables are defined to describe the architecture: relative measurement graph and communication & fusion graph. The measurements are integrated through extended Kalman filters, and the state covariance matrices are rigorously derived and bounded to establish the relationship between the navigation performance and the integration architecture.

An Efficient and Secure Certificate-Based Access Control and Key Agreement Scheme for Flying Ad-Hoc Networks,"The evolution of Flying Ad-hoc Networks (FANETs) marks the paradigm shift from a single large drone to multiple small drones linked together in an ad-hoc fashion. To maintain the Quality of Service (QoS) in the multi-hop networking schema, FANETs utilize the available resources efficiently. However, due to open wireless boundary and high mobility of the drones, the FANETs are vulnerable to malicious nodes that can penetrate the network and, thus, pose serious security threats, particularly at the Medium Access Control (MAC) layer. Such susceptibility compromises the network security and privacy and harms the information exchange operation within the network. The attacker can either transmit a large number of reservation requests to waste the bandwidth, listen to the control messages, conduct power-efficient jamming or falsify the information to manipulate the network control. Therefore, secure access control and a key agreement mechanism are required. The mechanism must utilize the two phases, i.e., node authentication and key agreement, to counter the aforementioned attacks. Our contribution, in this paper, is a certificate-based access control and key agreement scheme, which is based on the technique of Hyperelliptic Curve Cryptography (HECC) and employs a collision-resistant one-way cryptographic hash function. In order to assess the viability and performance of the proposed scheme, we analyze it using formal security analysis techniques, such as the Real-Or-Random (ROR) model and Automated Validation of Internet Security Protocols and Applications (AVISPA) tool. The scheme is also evaluated using the informal security analysis technique, or the non-mathematical approach. The results obtained from both analyses affirm the superiority of our proposed scheme.  © 1967-2012 IEEE.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85100714243&doi=10.1109%2fTVT.2021.3055895&partnerID=40&md5=4e930a83221c1e6a9ba23df1911884f4,IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology,2021
Toward Achieving Fine-Grained Access Control of Data in Connected and Autonomous Vehicles,"A connected and autonomous vehicle (CAV) is often fitted with a large number of onboard sensors and applications to support autonomous driving functions. Based on the current research, little work on applications' access to in-vehicle data has been done. Furthermore, most existing autonomous driving operating systems lack authentication and encryption units. As such, applications can excessively obtain confidential information, such as vehicle location and owner preferences and even upload it to the cloud, threatening the security of the vehicle and the privacy of the owner. In this study, we propose a fine-grained access control scheme to restrict applications' access to data in CAVs (FGAC-inCAVs). First, we present a system model composed of the following elements: a trusted third party (TTP), which is a fully trusted authority; perception components like sensors, which can capture the road information (pictures, videos, etc.); and multiple applications. Then, a fast attribute-based encryption (ABE) is presented, and security analysis also shows it is secure against selective and chosen-plaintext attacks. Furthermore, we propose a key update scheme based on the Chinese remainder theorem (CRT). Finally, the theoretical analysis and simulation experiments demonstrate its feasibility and efficiency.  © 2014 IEEE.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85097439152&doi=10.1109%2fJIOT.2020.3041860&partnerID=40&md5=74bacad64daffb352a0f0c2b8f6a12bb,IEEE Internet of Things Journal,2021
Multi-objective optimization of dive trajectory for morphing unmanned aerial-underwater vehicle,"A well-planned dive trajectory is the key for the trans-media maneuver and flight control of morphing unmanned aerial-underwater vehicles (MUAUVs). The main focus of this paper is the application of a watch-based multi-objective grey wolf optimizer (MOGWO) to dive trajectory optimization problems. A multi-objective trajectory optimization model considering the change of sweep angle and static moment is developed and parameterized by the Gauss pseudospectral method, and a multi-objective nonlinear programming problem is constructed. To overcome the defect that, in the MOGWO, the rest wolves blindly follow the best wolves, the watch strategy is introduced, which provides the wolves with the ability of independent exploration. Subsequently, the watch-based MOGWO is employed to generate the Pareto front, which is compared with that obtained through other multi-objective techniques. The simulation results demonstrated that the proposed method is more reliable and can obtain more widely distributed non-dominated solutions, indicating that the watch-based MOGWO is effective and feasible in dealing with multi-objective trajectory optimization problems with complex constraints. In addition, comparative studies on optimal trajectories demonstrated that the maneuverability and gliding ability of the MUAUV are improved through cooperation between the angle-of-attack, bank angle, and sweep angle. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85103637639&doi=10.1016%2fj.oceaneng.2021.108930&partnerID=40&md5=6f53fa4e100d8f473067ef543de06843,Ocean Engineering,2021
"Design, aerodynamic analysis and test flight of a bat-inspired tailless flapping wing unmanned aerial vehicle","This paper provided a design of bat-inspired tailless flapping wing unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) based on the biological data of the large flying fox. The wing span of the UAV is 1.68 m and the total mass is 289 g. Aerodynamic characteristics at design cruise speed were analyzed based on the computational fluid dynamics (CFD) method. Selected variables within the analysis are angle of attack and flapping frequency. Prototype of the UAV has been manufactured follows the design parameters. The flapping mechanism employed a 2-DOFs revolute-spherical-spherical-revolute (RSSR) system to reflect the flapping attitude of bats. An outdoor test flight was then processed with the manufactured prototype. Onboard flight data recorder (FDR) was equipped to conserve the flight data such as flight speed, pitching angle and the three-dimensional position of the flight. It is shown by the data obtained from the FDR that the bat-inspired UAV is able to achieve the stable cruise with circular route at flight speed 6.8 m/s with the average angle of attack 4.1 degrees and flapping frequency 3.7 Hz. Test flight shows that the UAV is able to provide a 5 minutes free outdoor cruise with the equipped Li-Po battery. Research proves that the tailless configuration flapping wing UAV is able to sustain a stable flight, which provides a new design possibility for future researches. © 2021 Elsevier Masson SAS",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85101843829&doi=10.1016%2fj.ast.2021.106557&partnerID=40&md5=3a6ebd567460156b1accf78293216adc,Aerospace Science and Technology,2021
Using Eye Gaze to Enhance Generalization of Imitation Networks to Unseen Environments,"Vision-based autonomous driving through imitation learning mimics the behavior of human drivers by mapping driver view images to driving actions. This article shows that performance can be enhanced via the use of eye gaze. Previous research has shown that observing an expert's gaze patterns can be beneficial for novice human learners. We show here that neural networks can also benefit. We trained a conditional generative adversarial network to estimate human gaze maps accurately from driver-view images. We describe two approaches to integrating gaze information into imitation networks: eye gaze as an additional input and gaze modulated dropout. Both significantly enhance generalization to unseen environments in comparison with a baseline vanilla network without gaze, but gaze-modulated dropout performs better. We evaluated performance quantitatively on both single images and in closed-loop tests, showing that gaze modulated dropout yields the lowest prediction error, the highest success rate in overtaking cars, the longest distance between infractions, lowest epistemic uncertainty, and improved data efficiency. Using Grad-CAM, we show that gaze modulated dropout enables the network to concentrate on task-relevant areas of the image.  © 2012 IEEE.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85104976621&doi=10.1109%2fTNNLS.2020.2996386&partnerID=40&md5=ce2b446fbef3a5cbc7a1b2240a5f85d1,IEEE Transactions on Neural Networks and Learning Systems,2021
Designing Secure User Authentication Protocol for Big Data Collection in IoT-Based Intelligent Transportation System,"Secure access of the real-time data from the Internet-of-Things (IoT) smart devices (e.g., vehicles) by a legitimate external party (user) is an important security service for big data collection in the IoT-based intelligent transportation system (ITS). To deal with this important issue, we design a new three-factor user authentication scheme, called UAP-BCIoT, which relies on elliptic-curve cryptography (ECC). The mutual authentication between the user and an IoT device happens via the semitrusted cloud-gateway (CG) node in UAP-BCIoT. UAP-BCIoT supports several functionality features needed for IoT-based ITS environment including IoT smart device credential validation and big data analytics. A detailed security analysis is conducted based on the defined threat model to show that UAP-BCIoT is resilient against many known attacks. A thorough comparative study reveals that UAP-BCIoT supports better security, offers various functionality attributes, and also provides similar costs in communication as well computation as compared to other relevant schemes Finally, the practical demonstration of the proposed UAP-BCIoT is also provided to measure its impact on the network performance parameters. © 2014 IEEE.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85102970509&doi=10.1109%2fJIOT.2020.3040938&partnerID=40&md5=c9ef0e0cb9e3daae35a576794ec04d4c,IEEE Internet of Things Journal,2021
Event-Based Resilient Formation Control of Multiagent Systems,"This paper focuses on the time-varying formation tracking issue for nonlinear multiagent systems (MASs). Based on the explicit characterizations of frequency, duration, and magnitude properties for deception attacks, a hybrid framework is proposed for time-varying formation tracking of nonlinear MASs. To realize the desired formation tracking performance under deception attacks, the distributed edge-based event-triggered communication strategies are proposed with Zeno-freeness. The designed strategies are resilient to deception attacks under some appropriate assumptions, to realize a predefined formation and simultaneously track the convex combination of leaders' states. The designed control strategies render that we do not need to detect when the deception attack happens. Furthermore, the obtained results can be deduced to deal with consensus/synchronization problems, target enclosing problems for MASs with one/multiple leaders, where the communication is attacked by malicious attackers. An example of time-varying formation tracking of unmanned aerial vehicles is provided to show the effectiveness of the obtained results.  © 2013 IEEE.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85104580492&doi=10.1109%2fTCYB.2019.2910614&partnerID=40&md5=69f6dfda4cbcd5cbf297ca97e9ddbc04,IEEE Transactions on Cybernetics,2021
Learning Self-Awareness for Autonomous Vehicles: Exploring Multisensory Incremental Models,"The technology for autonomous vehicles is close to replacing human drivers by artificial systems endowed with high-level decision-making capabilities. In this regard, systems must learn about the usual vehicle's behavior to predict imminent difficulties before they happen. An autonomous agent should be capable of continuously interacting with multi-modal dynamic environments while learning unseen novel concepts. Such environments are not often available to train the agent on it, so the agent should have an understanding of its own capacities and limitations. This understanding is usually called self-awareness. This paper proposes a multi-modal self-awareness modeling of signals coming from different sources. This paper shows how different machine learning techniques can be used under a generic framework to learn single modality models by using Dynamic Bayesian Networks. In the presented case, a probabilistic switching model and a bank of generative adversarial networks are employed to model a vehicle's positional and visual information respectively. Our results include experiments performed on a real vehicle, highlighting the potentiality of the proposed approach at detecting abnormalities in real scenarios.  © 2000-2011 IEEE.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85107411783&doi=10.1109%2fTITS.2020.2984735&partnerID=40&md5=6bd6592bd060ba2eee335ee281c4d134,IEEE Transactions on Intelligent Transportation Systems,2021
Vehicle Localization via Cooperative Channel Mapping,"This paper addresses vehicle positioning, a topic whose importance has risen dramatically in the context of future autonomous driving systems. While classical methods that use GPS and/or beacon signals from network infrastructure for triangulation tend to be sensitive to multi-paths and signal obstruction, our method exhibits robustness with respect to such phenomena. Our approach builds on the recently proposed Channel-SLAM method which first enabled leveraging of multi-path so as to improve (single) vehicle positioning. Here, we propose a cooperative mapping approach which builds upon the Channel-SLAM concept, referred to here as Team Channel-SLAM. Team Channel-SLAM not only exploits the stationary nature of many reflecting objects around the vehicle, but also capitalizes on the multi-vehicle nature of road traffic. The key intuition behind our method is the exploitation for the first time of the correlation between reflectors around multiple neighboring vehicles. An algorithm is derived for reflector selection and estimation, combined with a team particle filter (TPF) so as to achieve high precision simultaneous multiple vehicle positioning. We obtain large improvement over the single-vehicle positioning scenario, with gains being already noticeable for moderate vehicle densities, such as over \boldsymbol{40\%} improvement for a vehicle density as low as 4 vehicles in 132 meters' length road.  © 1967-2012 IEEE.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85104660569&doi=10.1109%2fTVT.2021.3073682&partnerID=40&md5=b43f40969ee70c5fd2d2e7d2070a63df,IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology,2021
Autonomous Vehicle Source Enumeration Exploiting Non-Cooperative UAV in Software Defined Internet of Vehicles,"The traffic congestion and accidents can be relieved by deploying the software defined internet of vehicles (SDN-IoV). However, the traffic of pedestrians and vehicles is particularly heavy near commercial streets and campuses. In particular scenarios, the SDN-IoV may not ensure the quality of service (QoS) for pedestrians and vehicles. In this paper, we construct a novel system architecture consisting of multiple non-cooperative unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) and a SDN-IoV. The non-cooperative UAV is equipped with an antenna array to receive the signals from the vehicles and pedestrians of SDN-IoV. In order to locate the positions of vehicles and pedestrians, two source enumeration methods are proposed in a complex SDN-IoV environment with color noise. The projection matrix of the low dimensional signal subspace is constructed by the proposed criterion based on signal subspace projection (SSP). The sequence of the projected difference values of the local covariance matrix is applied to estimate the number of vehicles and pedestrians. The eigenvalues can be grouped to construct different subspaces by the proposed eigen-subspace projection (ESP). By projecting a new covariance matrix into the eigen-subspaces, the variance of values represents the projection difference can be exploited to estimate the number of vehicles and pedestrians. Simulation results and real system test verify the validity of the two proposed methods by comparing them with the state-of-the-art methods. Both of the methods have excellent estimation performance especially in color noise.  © 2000-2011 IEEE.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85107430894&doi=10.1109%2fTITS.2020.3018377&partnerID=40&md5=3de85f9ee8b40e924c05a420c71ea3cc,IEEE Transactions on Intelligent Transportation Systems,2021
UAV airborne collision to manned aircraft engine: Damage of fan blades and resultant thrust loss,"Recently, the growing amount of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) has brought a huge threat to the safety management of manned aircraft operation, in which the UAV airborne collision is an incident that would lead to serious damage to the manned aircraft and will affect its operational safety significantly. In the present paper, the bird strike data over the year of 1990∼2019 is analyzed, which demonstrates that the engine is the most vulnerable component under bird strike, and the most severe hazard would happen during the flight phases of take-off, climb and approach. The dynamic response of UAV airborne collision with the manned aircraft engine is simulated based on the combination of FEM (Finite Element Method) and CFD (Computational Fluid Dynamics) simulations. Not only the damage of fan blades but also the thrust loss of the engine core caused by the damage in the compressor core is taken into account. The damage severity level of the engine under UAV airborne collision is studied by considering different collision configurations, different collision positions and different flight phases. Both the damage of fan blades and the percentage of thrust loss are considered to reflect the influence of UAV airborne collision on the aircraft operation. It is expected that this study can be used to guide the airborne safety assessment of UAV airborne collision. © 2021 Elsevier Masson SAS",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85104152070&doi=10.1016%2fj.ast.2021.106645&partnerID=40&md5=c7cc7c0dacb097bae936718e64362983,Aerospace Science and Technology,2021
Peak shaving in district heating exploiting reinforcement learning and agent-based modelling,"District Heating (DH) technology is considered to be a sustainable and quasi-renewable way of producing and distributing hot water along the city to heat buildings. However, the main obstacle to wider adoption of DH technology is represented by the thermal request peak in the morning hours of winter days, especially in Mediterranean countries. In this paper, this peak-shaving problem is tackled by combining three different approaches. A thermodynamic model is used to monitor the buildings’ thermal response to energy profile modifications. An agent-based model is adopted in order to represent the end-users and their adaptability to variations of temperatures in buildings. Finally, a Reinforcement Learning algorithm is used to optimally mediate between two needs: on the one hand, a set of anticipations and delays is applied to the energy profiles in order to reduce the thermal request peak. On the other hand, the algorithm learns by trial and error the individual agents’ sensitivity to thermal comfort, avoiding drastic modifications for the most sensitive users. The experiments carried out in the DH network in Torino (north-west of Italy) demonstrate that the proposed approach, compared with a literature solution chosen as a baseline, allows to achieve better results in terms of overall performances and speed of convergence. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85103780625&doi=10.1016%2fj.engappai.2021.104235&partnerID=40&md5=484ede59e17add16780c10dd82aaa3e2,Engineering Applications of Artificial Intelligence,2021
Uplink NOMA Using Power Allocation for UAV-Aided CSMA/CA Networks,"One of the most attractive applications of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) is deploying wireless communication systems. We consider a UAV-based low-Altitude platform (LAP) to deploy an aerial hotspot to provide Wi-Fi coverage without infrastructure and severe shadowing by urban or mountainous terrain. To address the performance degradation of carrier sense multiple access with collision avoidance (CSMA/CA) by increasing packet collisions with the number of clients, we exploit nonorthogonal multiple access (NOMA). To the best of authors' knowledge, there are no previous studies on uplink NOMA in CSMA/CA networks. In the considered system, owing to the distributed architecture and small channel difference of stations, conventional NOMA methods in cellular systems are not suitable. In this paper, we propose a power allocation scheme for uplink transmissions using predetermined power levels with a stochastic power selection to reduce the probability of packet collisions. A new medium access control procedure for uplink NOMA with CSMA/CA is also presented. The analytic results demonstrate that the proposed scheme achieves better saturation throughput and average packet delay than conventional CSMA/CA.  © 2007-2012 IEEE.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85103245945&doi=10.1109%2fJSYST.2020.3028884&partnerID=40&md5=c95c3051a8a7135a926825d42c57bd1f,IEEE Systems Journal,2021
A Novel Control Approach for Flight-Stability of Fixed-Wing UAV Formation with Wind Field,"This article addressed the flight-stability of the closed-loop system for a three fixed-wing unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) formation flight with wind field. A novel control strategy is presented to resist the influence of the wind field and then achieve a precise strike on the ground targets in the process of UAV air-to-ground strike mission. It is theoretically proved that the proposed controller system can be asymptotically stabilized. Both the dynamic response and steady-state error can converge to zero, respectively. The main contribution of this article is to establish a theoretical framework for designing an integrated controller to ensure that the UAVs precisely attack ground targets by adjusting the relevant parameters of the designed controller. The integrated controller we designed can control the consensus of the velocity for the UAV formation, and the distance between any two UAVs in three-dimensional space remains unchanged so that the UAV formation keeps a fixed geometry in case of decoupling. The effectiveness of the proposed controller is fully proved by a three fixed-wing UAVs formation flight. The simulation results show that the integrated control method integrates the advantages of the robust control with uncertain factors and the proportion-integration-differentiation control with rapid response. © 2007-2012 IEEE.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85110913303&doi=10.1109%2fJSYST.2020.3002809&partnerID=40&md5=9e4db2f5cb5f74b97df03bcc89ba08fe,IEEE Systems Journal,2021
An Adversarial Attack Based on Incremental Learning Techniques for Unmanned in 6G Scenes,"With the development of artificial intelligence(AI), unmanned vehicles can relieve traffic jamming and decrease the risk of traffic accidents, where deep neural networks (DNNs) play an important role and have become one of the most critical technologies. Nevertheless, DNNs are still susceptible to adversarial examples. Even worse, they also show severe performance degradation when the system needs DNNs to learn new knowledge without forgetting the old one. As unmanned vehicles travel on the road, they need to frequently learn new categories and different representations. Learning all data after the new sample arrives will expend a lot of time and space. As a result, it will affect the deployment of artificial intelligence in unmanned scenes. In recent years, it has been observed that incremental learning technology can solve the above challenges. However, previously reported works mainly focused on batch learning. It is not clear how much impact the adversarial attack will have on the deep learning model when performing incremental learning tasks. This issue exposes the hidden safety risks of unmanned driving and increases discuss opportunities. Therefore, we propose an adversarial attack based on incremental learning techniques for unmanned scenes in this paper. Specifically, it can retain information previously learned by the model. At the same time, it can renew the old model to learn new model, thereby continually adding small perturbation to legitimate examples. A couple of experiments on the Pascal VOC 2012 dataset has been conducted, and the experiment results show that the adversarial attack based on incremental learning techniques has a higher attack success rate. Further, it can improve the successful attack rate by 8.43%.  © 1967-2012 IEEE.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85103762775&doi=10.1109%2fTVT.2021.3069426&partnerID=40&md5=c4afe9b4d96e51cca89120ec6b834d1a,IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology,2021
Bandwidth Design for Energy-Efficient Unmanned Aerial Vehicle Using Space-Time Line Code,"In this paper, considering a seamless control of an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) by a ground base station (GBS), the energy consumption of the UAV is minimized in the downlink communication from the GBS with multiple antennas to the UAV with two antennas. By exploiting the benefit of a space-time line code (STLC) scheme that does not require training for full channel estimation at the receiver, i.e., the UAV, we employ the STLC scheme and design the passband bandwidth. Precisely, the number of symbols within the given frame duration is designed to reduce the total energy consumption at the UAV for the given data volume. With the designed frame, we numerically verify that the proposed STLC-based UAV consumes less energy than a UAV employing the maximum eigen beamforming scheme when optimized in terms of the received signal-to-noise ratio.  © 2020 IEEE.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85101146642&doi=10.1109%2fJSYST.2020.3012281&partnerID=40&md5=23ad697242dcc02859a25eea25f8c98a,IEEE Systems Journal,2021
"Robust 60-GHz Beamforming for UAVs: Experimental Analysis of Hovering, Blockage, and Beam Selection","Unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) mounted millimeter-wave (mmWave) base stations as well as aerial backhaul links will enable on-demand deployment of network resources. However, prior work has shown aerial links are prone to the frequent disruption caused by: 1) constant hovering due to GPS inaccuracies that impact narrow beamwidths; 2) blockages in the direct line of sight; and 3) suboptimal beam selection, especially if reduced angular sectors are searched in a highly dynamic environment. This article characterizes the impact of each of these phenomena for aerial mmWave links and proposes methods to distinctly identify when they occur in isolation or in combination during deployment. Furthermore, it also proposes corrective actions at the UAV, appropriate for the specific type(s) of impacting events: physical displacement from its earlier location, angular rotation around its vertical axis, or beamwidth adjustment. Our approach relies on exploiting the information contained in the angular domain of a large data set of experimentally collected beam-selection outcomes, under the above practical scenarios. We incorporate GPS accuracy models and antenna radiation patterns to create a robust model of potential outages. We then propose device-agnostic algorithms that jointly optimize UAVs' physical movement and the beamforming procedure. The experimental results obtained by mounting a pair of 60-GHz channel sounders on M600 DJI UAVs reveal loss reduction of up to 74.7%, translated into 260% physical layer bit-rate improvement compared to the classical 802.11ad standards-defined approach.  © 2014 IEEE.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85107504992&doi=10.1109%2fJIOT.2020.3019456&partnerID=40&md5=1527bccf6691abb880e3586ea3e21a7b,IEEE Internet of Things Journal,2021
"Autonomous Shuttle-as-a-Service (ASaaS): Challenges, Opportunities, and Social Implications","Providing mobility services effectively to residents and visitors is a complex socio-technical system task to city public managers. Smart mobility systems aim to support the efficient exploitation of city transport facilities and sustainable mobility within the urban environment. People need to travel quickly and conveniently between locations at different scales, ranging from a few blocks within a city to a journey across cities. At the same time, goods need to be timely delivered, considering both the users and the businesses' needs. Several cities indicated an interest in using Autonomous Vehicles (AV) for the 'last-mile' mobility services in the last few years. With them, it seems to be easier to get people and goods around using fewer vehicles. In this context, Autonomous Shuttles (AS) are beginning to be thought of as a new mobility/delivery service into the city center where narrow streets are not easily served by traditional buses. They allow them to perform critical areas with minimal new infrastructure and reduce noise and pollution. The article analyses the state-of-art on autonomous shuttles by proposing four application scenarios targeting the last-mile delivery of goods, the tourist experiences, and the shared and integrated mobility. Furthermore, we contribute with the proposition of the Autonomous Shuttles-as-a service (ASaaS) concept as the key pillar for the realization of innovative and sustainable proximity mobility. Our research proposed new research challenges for ASaaS, and we discuss social implications and governance challenges that consider user engagement and sustainability. It also recommended extending new research to focus on simulation and machine learning techniques for last-mile mobility planning and explore the journeys tracking certification via artificial intelligence and blockchain-based techniques.  © 2000-2011 IEEE.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85097017596&doi=10.1109%2fTITS.2020.3025670&partnerID=40&md5=94192ca28cf016e062690c67ea722c55,IEEE Transactions on Intelligent Transportation Systems,2021
Energy-Efficient UAV-Enabled Data Collection via Wireless Charging: A Reinforcement Learning Approach,"In this article, we study the application of unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) for data collection with wireless charging, which is crucial for providing seamless coverage and improving system performance in the next-generation wireless networks. To this end, we propose a reinforcement learning-based approach to plan the route of UAV to collect sensor data from sensor devices scattered in the physical environment. Specifically, the physical environment is divided into multiple grids, where one spot for UAV hovering as well as the wireless charging of UAV is located at the center of each grid. Each grid has a spot for the UAV to hover, and moreover, there is a wireless charger at the center of each grid, which can provide wireless charging to UAV when it is hovering in the grid. When the UAV lacks energy, it can be charged by the wireless charger at the spot. By taking into account the collected data amount as well as the energy consumption, we formulate the problem of data collection with UAV as a Markov decision problem, and exploit Q -learning to find the optimal policy. In particular, we design the reward function considering the energy efficiency of UAV flight and data collection, based on which Q -table is updated for guiding the route of UAV. Through extensive simulation results, we verify that our proposed reward function can achieve a better performance in terms of the average throughput, delay of data collection, as well as the energy efficiency of UAV, in comparison with the conventional capacity-based reward function.  © 2014 IEEE.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85099538795&doi=10.1109%2fJIOT.2021.3051370&partnerID=40&md5=d3303a875b3e14174c0ccc7886dbafbc,IEEE Internet of Things Journal,2021
Resilient Synchronization of Voltage/Frequency in AC Microgrids under Deception Attacks,"This article proposes a resilient distributed secondary voltage and frequency control scheme for autonomous ac microgrids considering disturbances and attacks on both sensors and actuators. To achieve the main objectives of the control system, first, a distributed state observer is employed to predict the normal behavior of state variables in the presence of potential deception attacks. Then, a distributed ${H_\infty }$ controller is utilized to mitigate the impacts of disturbances and uncertainties. Finally, to overcome the detrimental effects of attack signals, a resilient distributed adaptive algorithm is integrated with the designed ${H_\infty }$ controller. The proposed control algorithm has no restriction on the number of agents under attack and guarantees the boundedness of synchronization errors for all units. Also, in addition to distributed generation units, the contribution of distributed energy storage (DES) units in the regulation of voltage, frequency, and active power sharing is considered. Due to the limited energy of DESs, it is needed to balance the state of charge of these units. We evaluate the performance of the proposed algorithm using offline digital time-domain simulation studies carried out on a test microgrid system in MATLAB/Simulink environment, and the results are compared with previously reported methods. Simulation results and comparison with previous works reveal the effectiveness and accuracy of the proposed algorithm in regulating microgrid voltage and frequency.  © 2007-2012 IEEE.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85085981119&doi=10.1109%2fJSYST.2020.2992309&partnerID=40&md5=8e2b2151dcd411c053c93c23ca799c8b,IEEE Systems Journal,2021

Automotive Ethernet replaces the controller area network and FlexRay to support the large throughput required by high-definition applications. As CAVs have numerous functions, they exhibit a large attack surface and an increased vulnerability to attacks. However, no previous studies have focused on intrusion detection in automotive Ethernet-based networks. In this paper, we present an intrusion detection method for detecting audio-video transport protocol (AVTP) stream injection attacks in automotive Ethernet-based networks. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first such method developed for automotive Ethernet. The proposed intrusion detection model is based on feature generation and a convolutional neural network (CNN). To evaluate our intrusion detection system, we built a physical BroadR-Reach-based testbed and captured real AVTP packets. The experimental results show that the model exhibits outstanding performance: the F1-score and recall are greater than 0.9704 and 0.9949, respectively. In terms of the inference time per input and the generation intervals of AVTP traffic, our CNN model can readily be employed for real-time detection. © 2021 Elsevier Inc.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85100769310&doi=10.1016%2fj.vehcom.2021.100338&partnerID=40&md5=636f8d51c2a9cd1274534a20a086533c,Vehicular Communications,2021
Tightly Coupled Inertial Navigation System with Signals of Opportunity Aiding,"A tightly coupled inertial navigation system (INS) aided by ambient signals of opportunity (SOPs) is developed. In this system, a navigating vehicle aids its onboard INS using pseudoranges drawn from terrestrial SOPs with unknown emitter positions and clock biases through an extended Kalman filter-based radio simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM) framework. The SOP-aided INS uses both global navigation satellite system (GNSS) and SOP pseudoranges during GNSS availability periods and switches to using SOP pseudoranges exclusively during GNSS unavailability periods. This framework is studied through numerical simulations by varying: 1) Quantity of exploited SOPs and 2) quality of SOP-equipped oscillators. It is demonstrated that the SOP-aided INS using a consumer-grade IMU produces smaller estimation uncertainties compared to a traditional tightly coupled GNSS-aided INS using a tactical-grade IMU. In the absence of GNSS signals, over the simulation finite-time horizon, the errors produced by the SOP-aided INS appear to be bounded, while the errors produced by a traditional tightly coupled GNSS-aided INS diverge unboundedly. Moreover, the article presents experimental results demonstrating an unmanned aerial vehicle using terrestrial cellular SOPs to aid its onboard consumer-grade IMU in the absence of GNSS signals. It is demonstrated that the final position error of a traditional tightly coupled GNSS-aided INS after 30 s of GNSS cutoff was 57.30 m, while the final position error of the tightly coupled SOP-aided INS was 9.59 m.  © 1965-2011 IEEE.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85100494845&doi=10.1109%2fTAES.2021.3054067&partnerID=40&md5=85f105eb7e3ee913cca0dfb9d3f47d0a,IEEE Transactions on Aerospace and Electronic Systems,2021
Location-Based Robust Beamforming Design for Cellular-Enabled UAV Communications,"Cellular communications have been regarded as promising approaches to deliver high-broadband communication links for unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), which have been widely deployed to conduct various missions, e.g., precision agriculture, forest monitoring, and border patrol. However, the unique features of aerial UAVs, including high-altitude manipulation, 3-D mobility, and rapid velocity changes, pose challenging issues to realize reliable cellular-enabled UAV communications, especially with the severe intercell interference generated by UAVs. To deal with this issue, we propose a novel position-based robust beamforming algorithm through complementarily integrating the navigation information and wireless channel information to improve the performance of cellular-enabled UAV communications. Specifically, in order to achieve the optimal beam weight vector, the navigation information of the UAV system is innovatively exploited to predict the changes of the direction-of-Arrival (DoA) angle. To fight against the high mobility of UAV operations, an optimization problem is formed by considering the tapered surface of DoA angle and solved to correct the inherent position error. Comprehensive simulation experiments are conducted and the results show that the proposed robust beamforming algorithm could achieve over 90% DoA estimation error reduction and up to 14-dB SINR gain compared with five benchmark beamforming algorithms, including linearly constrained minimum variance (LCMV), position-based beamforming, diagonal loading (DL), robust capon beamforming (RCB), and robust LCMV algorithm.  © 2014 IEEE.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85107484009&doi=10.1109%2fJIOT.2020.3028853&partnerID=40&md5=16cc082e2a53efb8a862d2cbe9c0621f,IEEE Internet of Things Journal,2021
Security Enhancement for Real-Time Independent In-Vehicle CAN-FD Messages in Vehicular Networks,"The rise of autonomous driving technology and the prosperity of mobile vehicular applications have brought tremendous pressure and put forward high bandwidth and low latency requirements for vehicular networks. Controller Area Network with Flexible Data-rate (CAN-FD) is a feasible choice to meet the high bandwidth and low latency requirements of in-vehicle communication of mobile vehicles. However, CAN-FD is vulnerable to masquerade attacks because it lacks necessary security authentication mechanisms and protection measures. This study presents a security enhancement technique called forward-backward exploration for independent in-vehicle CAN-FD messages while still guaranteeing each message is real-Time. In the forward-backward exploration solution, a novel dual-pointer (including the forward pointer and the backward pointer) solution is proposed; the Message Authentication Code (MAC) size of each message is then dynamically adjusted by presenting the dual-pointer movement rules until the total payload no longer increases. Experimental results with real-life CAN-FD message set provided by an automaker demonstrate the effectiveness of our solution. © 1967-2012 IEEE.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85101744347&doi=10.1109%2fTVT.2021.3061746&partnerID=40&md5=80fb92f76d26b5c014b922e563eda4a1,IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology,2021
Anomaly Detection for Cooperative Adaptive Cruise Control in Autonomous Vehicles Using Statistical Learning and Kinematic Model,"This paper focuses on Cooperative Adaptive Cruise Control (CACC) in autonomous vehicles. In CACC, vehicles regulate their speed according to a preceding 'leader' vehicle in the lane, forming a platoon. In a benign environment, CACC reduces fuel consumption, maximizes road capacity, and ensures traffic safety. However, CACC is vulnerable to various security threats. In this paper, we consider one of the critical threats, where the platoon leader is compromised, and forges acceleration information sent to platoon members. Such attack would lead to traffic instability and potential collisions. First, we propose information sharing in CACC model to allow vehicles and fixed infrastructure to sense and share information about platoon leaders, hence improves the reliability and supports the detection of anomalous behavior. Then, we propose a real-time anomaly detection mechanism that combines statistical learning with the physics laws of kinematics. Specifically, we propose Generalized Extreme Studentized Deviate with Sliding Chunks (GESD-SC) approach, which is applied at each vehicle in the platoon to detect anomalies in real-time based on the vehicle's own speeding decisions. Kinematic model is also utilized to detect unexpected deviations using the leader's information, communicated directly and observed by the leader's neighboring vehicle(s) and/or supporting infrastructure. Combining kinematic model with GESD-SC has shown to be effective in detecting falsification attacks in CACC. Furthermore, we analyze the time performance, and show that the proposed technique outperforms existing method in detection accuracy and processing time. © 2000-2011 IEEE.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85083434099&doi=10.1109%2fTITS.2020.2983392&partnerID=40&md5=ee7586e1bd92810a3455f6df93d9654b,IEEE Transactions on Intelligent Transportation Systems,2021
Adversarial Attack against Urban Scene Segmentation for Autonomous Vehicles,"Understanding the surrounding environment is crucial for autonomous vehicles to make correct driving decisions. In particular, urban scene segmentation is a significant integral module commonly equipped in the perception system of autonomous vehicles to understand the real scene like a human. Any missegmentation of the driving scenario can potentially result in uncontrollable consequences such as serious accidents or the exception of the perception system. In this article, we investigate the vulnerability of the popular scene segmentation models designed with the backbones of deep neural networks (DNNs), which have been shown to be sensitive to adversarial attacks. Specifically, we propose an iterative projected gradient-based attack method that can effectively fool several DNN-based segmentation models with a remarkably higher attacking successful rate, and much smaller adversarial perturbations. Moreover, we also develop an adversarial training algorithm with min-max optimization style to enrich the robustness of the scene segmentation models. Extensive experiments on the Cityscape benchmark dataset consisting of large-scale urban scene images for autonomous vehicles demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed attack method, as well as the benefit of the adversarial training scheme for the scene segmentation models.  © 2005-2012 IEEE.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85102389729&doi=10.1109%2fTII.2020.3024643&partnerID=40&md5=5fa81cabfc27c2e8763cc008b8965fab,IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics,2021
Malware on Internet of UAVs Detection Combining String Matching and Fourier Transformation,"Advanced persistent threat (APT), with intense penetration, long duration, and high customization, has become one of the most grievous threats to cybersecurity. Furthermore, the design and development of Internet-of-Things (IoT) devices often do not focus on security, leading APT to extend to IoT, such as the Internet of emerging unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs). Whether malware with attack payload can be successfully implanted into UAVs or not is the key to APT on the Internet of UAVs. APT malware on UAVs establishes communication with the command and control (CC) server to achieve remote control for UAVs-aware information stealing. Existing effective methods detect malware by analyzing malicious behaviors generated during CC communication. However, APT malware usually adopts a low-traffic attack mode, a large amount of normal traffic is mixed in each attack step, to avoid virus checking and killing. Therefore, it is difficult for traditional malware detection methods to discover APT malware on UAVs that carry weak abnormal signals. Fortunately, we found that most APT attacks use domain name system (DNS) to locate CC server of malware for information transmission periodically. This behavior will leave some records in the network flow and DNS logs, which provides us with an opportunity to identify infected internal UAVs and external malicious domain names. This article proposes an APT malware on the Internet of UAVs detection method combining string matching and Fourier transformation based on DNS traffic, which is able to handle encrypted and obfuscated traffic due to packet payloads independence. We preprocessed the collected network traffic by converting DNS timestamps of DNS request to strings and used the trained random forest model to discover APT malware domain names based on features extracted through string-matching-based periodicity detection and Fourier transformation-based periodicity detection. The proposed method has been evaluated on the data set, including part of normal domains from the normal traffic and malicious domains marked by security experts from APT malware traffic. Experimental results have shown that our proposed detection method can achieve the accuracy of 94%, which is better than the periodicity detection algorithm alone. Moreover, the proposed method does not need to set the confidence to filter the periodicity with high confidence.  © 2014 IEEE.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85107462727&doi=10.1109%2fJIOT.2020.3029970&partnerID=40&md5=104e46a2f789d5a41c8182046d8d769c,IEEE Internet of Things Journal,2021
Improving Navigation in GNSS-Challenging Environments: Multi-UAS Cooperation and Generalized Dilution of Precision,"This article presents an approach to tackle navigation challenges for unmanned aircraft systems flying under non-nominal GNSS coverage. The concept used to improve navigation performance in these environments consists of using one or more cooperative platforms and relative sensing measurements (based on vision and/or ranging) to the navigation aid. The article details the cooperative navigation filter, which can exploit multiple cooperative platforms and multiple relative measurements while also using the partial GNSS information. The achievable navigation accuracy can be predicted using the concept of 'generalized dilution of precision,' which derives from applying the idea of the dilution of precision to the mathematical structure of the cooperative navigation filter. The values and trends of generalized dilution of precision are discussed as a function of the relative geometry in common GNSS-challenging scenarios. Finally, navigation performance is assessed based on simulations and multidrone flight tests.  © 1965-2011 IEEE.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85097927189&doi=10.1109%2fTAES.2020.3043543&partnerID=40&md5=8ac223d8f160727f8045b22601dac299,IEEE Transactions on Aerospace and Electronic Systems,2021
Three-Dimensional-Map-Based Trajectory Design in UAV-Aided Wireless Localization Systems,"This article considers the problem of localizing outdoor ground radio users with the help of an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) on the basis of received signal strength (RSS) measurements in an urban environment. We assume that the propagation model parameters are not known a priori, and depending on the UAV location, the UAV-user link can experience either Line-of-Sight (LoS) or Non-Line-of-Sight (NLoS) propagation condition. We assume that a 3-D map of the environment is available which the UAV can exploit in the localization process. Based on the proposed map-aided estimator, we devise an optimal UAV trajectory to accelerate the learning process under a limited mission time. To do so, we borrow tools, such as Fisher information from the theory of optimal experiment design. Our map-aided estimator achieves superior localization accuracy compared to the map-unaware methods, and our simulations show that optimized UAV trajectory achieves superior learning performance compared to random trajectories.  © 2014 IEEE.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85107500259&doi=10.1109%2fJIOT.2020.3021611&partnerID=40&md5=acedfc161642706799636c4c6ae02943,IEEE Internet of Things Journal,2021
Deep Learning Based Autonomous Vehicle Super Resolution DOA Estimation for Safety Driving,"In this paper, a novel system architecture including a massive multi-input multi-output (MIMO) or a reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS) and multiple autonomous vehicles is considered in vehicle location systems. The location parameters of autonomous vehicles can be estimated based on the deep unfolding technique, which is a recent advance of deep learning. Traditional vehicle location methods such as the global position system (GPS) can only locate the target vehicles with relatively low accuracy. The super resolution cannot be achieved when two vehicles are too close, which means that the safety incidents exist when autonomous vehicles are deployed in future intelligent transportation systems (ITS). Different from the existing massive MIMO or RIS equipped with a regular array such as uniform rectangular array (URA) and uniform circular array (UCA), we exploit a massive MIMO or a RIS equipped with a conformal array extended from traditional regular array. First, the rotation from the global coordinate system to the local coordinate system is achieved based on geometric algebra. Second, 2D-DOA estimation of autonomous vehicles is modeled as a novel block sparse recovery problem. Third, the deep network architecture SBLNet is implemented to learn the nonlinear characteristic from the DOAs of autonomous vehicles and the data received by massive MIMOs or RISs. The 2D-DOA and polarization parameters can be estimated based on SBLNet with relatively low computational complexity. Simulation results demonstrate that SBLNet performs better than the state-of-the-art methods in terms of estimation accuracy and successful probability. The SBLNet is also suitable for the practical scenario considering fast moving autonomous vehicles, while, the traditional block sparse recovery methods fail in this complex scenario.  © 2000-2011 IEEE.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85110792301&doi=10.1109%2fTITS.2020.3009223&partnerID=40&md5=29f5381e0485f73e45ef856b0132c8ea,IEEE Transactions on Intelligent Transportation Systems,2021
"Guidance, navigation and control for 6DOF rendezvous in Cislunar multi-body environment","Recent studies highlighted the benefits of a support infrastructure located in Cislunar environment, which would ease the design of forthcoming space missions with a favorable access from and to the lunar surface, the Earth and many interplanetary destinations. Multi-body orbits rose a peculiar interest and were selected to stage a human-robotic exploration outpost; the family of Near Rectilinear Halo Orbits (NRHO), in particular, appears specifically suitable in these regards. Among the different capabilities that such outpost will tend to, the docking with other crewed or autonomous vehicles is a key feature that shall be present. Although low Earth orbit (LEO) rendezvous and docking is well assessed, no mission has performed such task in a multi-body gravitational environment. The paper presents a guidance, navigation and control (GNC) framework for 6 degrees of freedom (6DOF) coupled Cislunar rendezvous and docking. A feasible operational rendezvous scenario is detailed and exploited to define open-loop and closed-loop GNC functions for far-range and close-range. Then, the final approach is analyzed, proposing a closed-loop GNC that encompasses coupled translational-rotational dynamics. Vision-based only relative navigation techniques are applied to Cislunar multi-body dynamics to guarantee a coupled state estimation with a simple suite of sensors and a broad applicability range, ranging from passively cooperative to non-cooperative or unknown target spacecraft. © 2021 Elsevier Masson SAS",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85105694009&doi=10.1016%2fj.ast.2021.106751&partnerID=40&md5=ec05333505d5e4dfac0fdbf7f6fc70f5,Aerospace Science and Technology,2021
Collaborating Underwater Vehicles Conducting Large-Scale Geospatial Tasks,"Consider large groups of unmanned underwater vehicles (UUVs) conducting large-scale geospatial tasks, such as information gathering or area sensing. Major costs of long duration missions include expensive underwater positioning systems and propulsion, which consumes energy. Exploiting the ocean currents can increase endurance, but requires accounting for forecast uncertainty, which lies beyond the scope of this article. State-of-the-art techniques, such as Monte Carlo tree search or cross entropy method that coordinate underwater vehicles for path-dependent rewards, do not scale well to such large groups. Furthermore, solving the mentioned tasks requires accounting for overlaps in the areas each vehicle searches, increasing the complexity of the problem. We therefore investigate planning techniques that can evaluate path-dependent rewards, account for the ocean forecast, and efficiently coordinate plans for many agents. Two formulations are investigated, which either search the space of action sequences or the space of feedback policies to find dynamically feasible trajectories. We present what we believe to be the first application of the cross entropy method to create joint plans for large groups of 8-128 UUVs. We also develop a novel iterative greedy method that further refines the best discovered constant action sequences to improve other greedy techniques. The iterative greedy method gathers the most information on average, scales well to deploying large groups of agents, and gathers 3%-8% more reward than other techniques.  © 1976-2012 IEEE.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85099731666&doi=10.1109%2fJOE.2020.3041123&partnerID=40&md5=8b0dd23a0278f81c5b5a35326b6f5278,IEEE Journal of Oceanic Engineering,2021
Novel Deep Learning-Enabled LSTM Autoencoder Architecture for Discovering Anomalous Events from Intelligent Transportation Systems,"Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS), especially Autonomous Vehicles (AVs), are vulnerable to security and safety issues that threaten the lives of the people. Unlike manual vehicles, the security of communications and computing components of AVs can be compromised using advanced hacking techniques, thus barring AVs from the effective use in our routine lives. Once manual vehicles are connected to the Internet, called the Internet of Vehicles (IoVs), it would be exploited by cyber-attacks, like denial of service, sniffing, distributed denial of service, spoofing and replay attacks. In this article, we present a deep learning-based Intrusion Detection System (IDS) for ITS, in particular, to discover suspicious network activity of In-Vehicles Networks (IVN), vehicles to vehicles (V2V) communications and vehicles to infrastructure (V2I) networks. A Deep Learning architecture-based Long-Short Term Memory (LSTM) autoencoder algorithm is designed to recognize intrusive events from the central network gateways of AVs. The proposed IDS is evaluated using two benchmark datasets, i.e., the car hacking dataset for in-vehicle communications and the UNSW-NB15 dataset for external network communications. The experimental results demonstrated that our proposed system achieved over a 99% accuracy for detecting all types of attacks on the car hacking dataset and a 98% accuracy on the UNSW-NB15 dataset, outperforming other eight intrusion detection techniques.  © 2000-2011 IEEE.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85110593488&doi=10.1109%2fTITS.2020.3017882&partnerID=40&md5=044705d4b36ff6afe3c72a340e9ba65b,IEEE Transactions on Intelligent Transportation Systems,2021
Threat Analysis for Automotive CAN Networks: A GAN Model-Based Intrusion Detection Technique,"With the rapid development of Internet of vehicles, connected vehicles, autonomous vehicles, and autonomous driving technologies, automotive Controller Area Networks (CAN) have suffered from numerous security threats. Deep learning models are the current mainstream intrusion detection techniques for threat analysis, and the state-of-the-art intrusion detection technique introduces the Generative Adversarial Networks (GAN) model to generate usable attacked samples to supplement the training samples, but it exists the limitations of rough CAN message block construction and fails to detect the data tampering threat. Based on the CAN communication matrix defined by the automotive Original Equipment Manufacturer (OEM) for a vehicle model, we propose an enhanced deep learning GAN model with elaborate CAN message blocks and the enhanced GAN discriminator. The elaborate CAN message blocks in the training samples can precisely reflect the real generated CAN message blocks in the detection phase. The GAN discriminator can detect whether each message has suffered from the data tampering threat. Experimental results illustrate that the enhanced deep learning GAN model has higher detection accuracy, recall, and F1 scores than the state-of-the-art deep learning GAN model under various attacks and threats. © 2000-2011 IEEE.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85101492636&doi=10.1109%2fTITS.2021.3055351&partnerID=40&md5=d1bf9fba0a41ae6c8d772e7067450852,IEEE Transactions on Intelligent Transportation Systems,2021
Cooperative pursuit of unauthorized UAVs in urban airspace via Multi-agent reinforcement learning,"Urban Air Mobility (UAM) is an emergent concept for future air transportation. With UAM, cargo and passengers will be transported on-demand in urban airspace. UAM has shown a promising prospect in mitigating ground congestion and providing people with an alternative mobility option. However, unauthorized unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) in urban airspace present a significant threat to safety of UAM, drawing significant attention from research communities recently. Among all solutions, cooperative pursuit using a team of UAVs is an effective countermeasure for unauthorized UAVs in urban airspace. In this paper, we model cooperative pursuit as a pursuit-evasion game problem (PEG) and propose a multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) based approach to solve the problem efficiently. The proposed approach incorporates novel cellular-enabled parameter sharing and curriculum learning schemes to enhance the capability of pursuer UAVs in capturing faster unauthorized UAVs in urban airspace. Extensive experiments have been conducted using simulated urban airspace in order to evaluate the performance of the proposed method. Experimental results demonstrate that by incorporating the parameter sharing scheme, the proposed methods provide much higher capturing rates in a shorter time. Such superiority is more evident when communication constraints are more stringent and/or unauthorized UAVs are faster. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85105470937&doi=10.1016%2fj.trc.2021.103122&partnerID=40&md5=a48f52762730454fd7a759b03b831baf,Transportation Research Part C: Emerging Technologies,2021
Data-driven ambiguity sets with probabilistic guarantees for dynamic processes,"Distributional ambiguity sets provide quantifiable ways to characterize the uncertainty about the true probability distribution of random variables of interest. This makes them a key element in data-driven robust optimization by exploiting high-confidence guarantees to hedge against uncertainty. This article explores the construction of Wasserstein ambiguity sets in dynamic scenarios, where data are collected progressively and may only reveal partial information about the unknown random variable. For random variables evolving according to known dynamics, we leverage assimilated samples to make inferences about their unknown distribution at the end of the sampling horizon. Under exact knowledge of the flow map, we provide sufficient conditions that relate the growth of the trajectories with the sampling rate to establish a reduction of the ambiguity set size as the horizon increases. Furthermore, we characterize the exploitable sample history that results in a guaranteed reduction of ambiguity sets under errors in the computation of the flow and when the dynamics is subject to bounded unknown disturbances. Our treatment deals with both full- and partial-state measurements and, in the latter case, exploits the sampled-data observability properties of linear time-varying systems under irregular sampling. Simulations on an unmanned aerial vehicle detection application show the superior performance resulting from the proposed dynamic ambiguity sets.  © 1963-2012 IEEE.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85099531485&doi=10.1109%2fTAC.2020.3014098&partnerID=40&md5=adef036662ca89df89987189a79a2e4b,IEEE Transactions on Automatic Control,2021
Multihop V2U Path Availability Analysis in UAV-Assisted Vehicular Networks,"The work presented in this article aims at improving the ground vehicle connectivity in the context of an intermittent vehicle-to-UAV (V2U) communication scenario where vehicles opportunistically establish time-limited connectivity with passing by unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) serving as flying base stations responsible for routing incoming vehicle data over backbone networks and/or the Internet. As opposed to existing work in the literature where vehicles are only allowed to establish direct connectivity with in-range UAVs, this work aims at also exploiting the possible formation of vehicular clusters and, hence, the feasibility of intervehicular communications to establish multihop paths connecting source vehicles to destination UAVs. A mathematical model is presented for the purpose of capturing the nodal (i.e., vehicles and UAVs) mobility dynamics and derive an expression for the overall V2U connectivity probability as well as the overall average vehicle connection time.

State Estimation for HALE UAVs with Deep-Learning-Aided Virtual AOA/SSA Sensors for Analytical Redundancy,"High-altitudelong-endurance (HALE) unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) are employed in a variety of fields because of their ability to fly for a long time at high altitudes, even in the stratosphere. Two paramount concerns exist: enhancing their safety during long-term flight and reducing their weight as much as possible to increase their energy efficiency based on analytical redundancy approaches. In this letter, a novel deep-learning-aided navigation filter is proposed, which consists of two parts: an end-to-end mapping-based synthetic sensor measurement model that utilizes long short-term memory (LSTM) networks to estimate the angle of attack (AOA) and sideslip angle (SSA) and an unscented Kalman filter for state estimation.

Dynamics of Laser-Charged UAVs: A Battery Perspective,"In this article, we aim to sustain unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV)-based missions for longer periods of times through different techniques. First, we consider on-the-mission UAV recharging by a low-power laser source (below 1 kW). In order to achieve the maximal energy gain from the low-power laser source, we propose an operational compromise, which consists of the UAV resting over buildings with cleared line of sight to the laser source. Second, to provide a precise energy consumption/harvesting estimation at the UAV, we investigate the latter's dynamics in a mission environment. Indeed, we study the UAV's battery dynamics by leveraging the electrical models for motors and battery. Subsequently, using these models, the path planning problem in a particular Internet-of-Things-based usecase is revisited from the battery perspective. The objective is to extend the UAV's operation time using both laser-charging and accurate battery level estimation. Through a graph theory approach, the problem is solved optimally, and compared to benchmark trajectory approaches. Numerical results demonstrate the efficiency of this novel battery perspective for all path planning approaches. In contrast, we found that the energy perspective is very conservative and does not exploit optimally the available energy resources. Nevertheless, we propose a simple adjustment method to correct the energy perspective, by carefully evaluating the energy as a function of the UAV motion regimes. Finally, the impact of several parameters, such as turbulence and distance to charging source, is studied. © 2014 IEEE.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85099085469&doi=10.1109%2fJIOT.2020.3048087&partnerID=40&md5=25d267dd1f0e1f7e52b3b8bb1438f740,IEEE Internet of Things Journal,2021
Efficient and Secured Swarm Pattern Multi-UAV Communication,"Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) or drone, is an evolving technology in today's market with an enormous number of applications. Mini UAVs are developed in order to compensate the performance constraints imposed by larger UAVs during emergency situations. Multiple mini autonomous UAVs require communication and coordination for ubiquitous coverage and relaying during deployment. Multi-UAV coordination or swarm optimization is required for reliable connectivity among UAVs, due to its high mobility and dynamic topology. In this paper, a Secured UAV (S-UAV) model is proposed which takes the location of the UAVs as inputs to form a Wireless Mesh Network (WMN) among multiple drones with the help of a centralized controller.

Accurate Detection and Localization of Unmanned Aerial Vehicle Swarms-Enabled Mobile Edge Computing System,"Unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) swarms-enabled mobile edge computing system can be deployed in critical industrial zones for monitoring. Meanwhile, its malicious use may bring great threat to the security, and the accurate detection, and localization are important. UAV swarms show characteristics of the high density, small radar cross section, far range, and time-varying motion, and have posed formidable challenges to the accurate detection and localization. In this article, the accurate detection and localization of UAV swarms are investigated, and an effective method is proposed based on the Dechirp-keystone transform, and frequency-selective reweighted trace minimization. It inherits high robustness of the coherent long-time integration technique and superresolution of the gridless sparse technique. Mathematical analyzes and numerical simulations validate its superiorities in accurate detection and localization of UAV swarms.  © 2005-2012 IEEE.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85104186701&doi=10.1109%2fTII.2020.3015730&partnerID=40&md5=ee5ca70869fdf1c7d860d2cc260e369b,IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics,2021
Avalanche Victim Search via Robust Observers,This article deals with the problem of victim localization in avalanches by using controlled unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) equipped with an electromagnetic sensor (known as ARVA) typically adopted in these search and rescue scenarios. We show that the nominal ARVA measurement can be linearly related to a quantity that is sufficient to reconstruct the victim position. We explicitly deal with a robust scenario in which the measurement is actually perturbed by the noise that grows with the distance to the victim and propose an adaptive control scheme based on a least-square identifier and a trajectory generator whose role is both to guarantee the persistence of excitation for the identifier and to steer the ARVA receiver toward the victim. We prove that the controller ensures boundedness of trajectories and enables to localize the victim in a domain where the ARVA output is sufficiently informative. We illustrate its performance in a realistic simulation framework specifically developed with real data. The proposed approach could significantly reduce the searching time by providing an exploitable estimate before having reached the victim. © 2020 IEEE.,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85158853705&doi=10.1109%2fTCST.2020.3016665&partnerID=40&md5=1da840b44fe4405978d2f2b4d0655301,IEEE Transactions on Control Systems Technology,2021
Detecting Generalized Replay Attacks via Time-Varying Dynamic Watermarking,"Cyber-physical systems (CPS) often rely on external communication for supervisory control or sensing. Unfortunately, these communications render the system vulnerable to cyber attacks. Attacks that alter messages, such as replay attacks that record measurement signals, and then play them back to the system can cause devastating effects. Dynamic Watermarking methods, which inject a private excitation into control inputs to secure resulting measurement signals, have begun addressing the challenges of detecting these attacks, but have been restricted to linear time-invariant (LTI) systems. Though LTI models are sufficient for some applications, other CPS, such as autonomous vehicles, require more complex models. This article develops a linear time-varying (LTV) extension to previous dynamic watermarking methods by designing a matrix normalization factor to accommodate the temporal changes in the system. Implementable tests are provided with considerations for real-world systems. The proposed method is then shown to be able to detect generalized replay attacks both in theory and in simulation using an LTV vehicle model. © 1963-2012 IEEE.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85111714193&doi=10.1109%2fTAC.2020.3022756&partnerID=40&md5=505364c934849fb94b8f505b105ba5bd,IEEE Transactions on Automatic Control,2021
Privacy-Aware Autonomous Valet Parking: Towards Experience Driven Approach,"Driverless parking, an influential application of Mobility as a Service (MaaS) model, is one of the clear early benefits for autonomous vehicles, given often narrow spaces and multiple potential hazards (such as pedestrians stepping out from in between other vehicles). In recent years, real momentum has been building up for designing automated parking models for vehicles. However, in such an autonomous parking design, location privacy and identity privacy issues are always overlapping due to the improper sharing of data. Most existing studies barely investigate and poorly address such privacy issues. Motivated by this, we develop (and evaluate) an experience-driven, secure and privacy-aware framework of parking reservations for automated cars. Our idea of using differential privacy with zero-knowledge proof provides both security and privacy guarantees to users. Furthermore, the performance of the developed model is enhanced by exploiting reinforcement learning approach such that the utility of the system and the parking reservation rate can be maximized. Extensive evaluation demonstrates the superiority of the proposed model. © 2000-2011 IEEE.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85112772775&doi=10.1109%2fTITS.2020.3006337&partnerID=40&md5=5dc1da9fa97b8c6756103ecc4de6f688,IEEE Transactions on Intelligent Transportation Systems,2021
Feasibility Study of UAV-Assisted Anti-Jamming Positioning,"As the cost and technical difficulty of jamming devices continue to decrease, jamming has become one of the major threats to positioning service. Unfortunately, most conventional wireless positioning technologies are vulnerable to jamming attacks due to inherent shortcomings like weak signal strength and unfavorable anchor geometry. Thanks to their high operational flexibility, unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) could be a promising solution to the above challenges. Therefore, in this article, we propose a UAV-assisted anti-jamming positioning system, in which multiple UAVs first utilize time-difference-of-arrival (TDoA) measurements from ground reference stations and double-response two-way ranging (DR-TWR) measurements from UAV-to-UAV links to perform self-localization as well as clock synchronization, and then act as anchor nodes to provide TDoA positioning service for ground users in the presence of jamming. To evaluate the feasibility and performance of the proposed system, we first derive the Cramér-Rao lower bound (CRLB) of UAV self-localization. Then, the impacts of UAV position uncertainty and synchronization errors caused by jamming on positioning service are modeled, and the theoretical root-mean-square error (RMSE) of user position estimate is further derived. Numerical results demonstrate that the proposed system is a promising alternative to existing positioning systems when their services are disrupted by jamming. The most notable advantage of the proposed system is that it is fully compatible with existing user equipment terminals and positioning methods.  © 1967-2012 IEEE.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85112143047&doi=10.1109%2fTVT.2021.3090403&partnerID=40&md5=2e8c52378fd75377b194824e5ed84b09,IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology,2021
Supporting IoT with Rate-Splitting Multiple Access in Satellite and Aerial-Integrated Networks,"To satisfy the explosive access demands of Internet-of-Things (IoT) devices, various kinds of multiple access techniques have received much attention. In this article, we investigate the multicast communication of a satellite and aerial-integrated network (SAIN) with rate-splitting multiple access (RSMA), where both satellite and unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) components are controlled by network management center and operate in the same frequency band. Considering a content delivery scenario, the UAV subnetwork adopts the RSMA to support massive access of IoT devices (IoTDs) and achieve desired performances of interference suppression, spectral efficiency, and hardware complexity. We first formulate an optimization problem to maximize the sum rate of the considered system subject to the signal-interference-plus-noise-ratio requirements of IoTDs and per-antenna power constraints at the UAV and satellite. To solve this nonconvex optimization problem, we exploit the sequential convex approximation and the first-order Taylor expansion to convert the original optimization problem into a solvable one with the rank-one constraint, and then propose an iterative penalty function-based algorithm to solve it. Finally, simulation results verify that the proposed method can effectively suppress the mutual interference and improve the system sum rate compared to the benchmark schemes. © 2014 IEEE.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85099730238&doi=10.1109%2fJIOT.2021.3051603&partnerID=40&md5=4a83915d37eee65efd6149b215fba0da,IEEE Internet of Things Journal,2021
Multiobjective Overtaking Maneuver Planning for Autonomous Ground Vehicles,"Constrained autonomous vehicle overtaking trajectories are usually difficult to generate due to certain practical requirements and complex environmental limitations. This problem becomes more challenging when multiple contradicting objectives are required to be optimized and the on-road objects to be overtaken are irregularly placed. In this article, a novel swarm intelligence-based algorithm is proposed for producing the multiobjective optimal overtaking trajectory of autonomous ground vehicles. The proposed method solves a multiobjective optimal control model in order to optimize the maneuver time duration, the trajectory smoothness, and the vehicle visibility, while taking into account different types of mission-dependent constraints. However, one problem that could have an impact on the optimization process is the selection of algorithm control parameters. To desensitize the negative influence, a novel fuzzy adaptive strategy is proposed and embedded in the algorithm framework. This allows the optimization process to dynamically balance the local exploitation and global exploration, thereby exploring the tradeoff between objectives more effectively. The performance of using the designed fuzzy adaptive multiobjective method is analyzed and validated by executing a number of simulation studies. The results confirm the effectiveness of applying the proposed algorithm to produce multiobjective optimal overtaking trajectories for autonomous ground vehicles. Moreover, the comparison to other state-of-the-art multiobjective optimization schemes shows that the designed strategy tends to be more capable in terms of producing a set of widespread and high-quality Pareto-optimal solutions.  © 2013 IEEE.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85112681529&doi=10.1109%2fTCYB.2020.2973748&partnerID=40&md5=6fa88862b5b1b2a4dc5735e6cd23ba8c,IEEE Transactions on Cybernetics,2021
"A study of the effect of airfoil thickness on the tonal noise generation of finite, wall-mounted airfoils","The noise generated by finite, wall-mounted airfoils strongly affects the total noise from aerodynamic applications such as small unmanned aerial vehicles, micro wind turbines and cooling fans. In an attempt to understand the effect of airfoil thickness on the trailing edge tonal noise generated by such airfoils, detailed wind tunnel experiments have been performed on two symmetric NACA-type airfoils with aspect ratio of 1.2 and nominal thicknesses of 12% and 18% of the chord length. The measurements included microphone array measurements, hot-wire measurements in the near wake of the airfoils and surface flow visualizations. It was found that the thickness has a strong impact on the tonal noise generation. At non-lifting conditions, the thinner airfoil generates tonal noise, while the thicker airfoil radiates broadband noise. At a slightly higher angle of attack (6∘), both airfoils generate tonal noise, but with different frequency and side-tone characteristics. Further increasing the angle (to 12∘) resulted in the generation of tonal noise from the thicker airfoil, while the far field spectrum obtained for the thinner airfoil has broadband character. This is attributed to the tip flow having stronger influence over the airfoil span in the case of the thinner airfoil leading to suppression of the tonal noise mechanism. Maps of the sound source locations, flow visualizations as well as detailed hot-wire measurements also provide further insight into the sound source mechanisms. © 2021 Elsevier Masson SAS",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85105555238&doi=10.1016%2fj.ast.2021.106768&partnerID=40&md5=e4fd99581edf5dfb0473105effabe9b4,Aerospace Science and Technology,2021
A Blockchain-Based Deep Learning Approach for Cyber Security in Next Generation Industrial Cyber-Physical Systems,"With the recent development of Internet of Things (IoT) in the next generation cyber-physical system (CPS) such as autonomous driving, there is a significant requirement of big data analysis with high accuracy and low latency. For efficient big data analysis, deep learning (DL) supports strong analytic capability; it has been applied at the cloud and edge layers by extensive research to provide accurate data analysis at low latency. However, existing researches failed to address certain challenges, such as centralized control, adversarial attacks, security, and privacy. To this end, we propose DeepBlockIoTNet, a secure DL approach with blockchain for the IoT network wherein the DL operation is carried out among the edge nodes at the edge layer in a decentralized, secure manner. The blockchain provides a secure DL operation and removes the control from a centralized authority.

Safety-enhanced UAV path planning with spherical vector-based particle swarm optimization,"This paper presents a new algorithm named spherical vector-based particle swarm optimization (SPSO) to deal with the problem of path planning for unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) in complicated environments subjected to multiple threats. A cost function is first formulated to convert the path planning into an optimization problem that incorporates requirements and constraints for the feasible and safe operation of the UAV. SPSO is then used to find the optimal path that minimizes the cost function by efficiently searching the configuration space of the UAV via the correspondence between the particle position and the speed, turn angle and climb/dive angle of the UAV. To evaluate the performance of SPSO, eight benchmarking scenarios have been generated from real digital elevation model maps. The results show that the proposed SPSO outperforms not only other particle swarm optimization (PSO) variants including the classic PSO, phase angle-encoded PSO and quantum-behave PSO but also other state-of-the-art metaheuristic optimization algorithms including the genetic algorithm (GA), artificial bee colony (ABC), and differential evolution (DE) in most scenarios.

Towards Ultra Reliable Low Latency Multipath TCP for Connected Autonomous Vehicles,"Connected Autonomous Vehicles (CAVs) are Not-So-Futuristic. CAVs will be highly dynamic by intelligently exploiting multipath communication over several radio technologies, such as high-speed WiFi and 5G and beyond networks. Yet, the likelihood of data communication loss can be very high and/, or packets arrive at the destination not in correct working order due to erratic and mixed time-varying wireless links. Furthermore, the vehicular data traffic is susceptible to loss and delay variation, which recommends the need to investigate new multipath TCP (MPTCP) protocols for ultra-reliable low latency communication (URLLC) over such heterogeneous networks while reassuring CAVs' needs. We undertake the challenge by jointly considering network coding and balanced linked adaptation for performing coupled congestion control across multiple wireless paths. Consequently, the proposed low delay MPTCP framework for connecting autonomous vehicles is efficient and intelligent by design. We conduct a rigorous convergence analysis of the MPTCP design framework. In summation, we provide a detailed mathematical study and demonstrate that the latency penalty for the URLLC-MPTCP developed over these networks becomes negligible when considering the possible benefits that multiple network convergence could offer. Our extensive emulation results demonstrate all these lucrative features of URLLC-MPTCP.  © 1967-2012 IEEE.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85108515197&doi=10.1109%2fTVT.2021.3093632&partnerID=40&md5=863c921ee50a85f1164ee1232596c7ef,IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology,2021
Implementing modified swarm intelligence algorithm based on Slime moulds for path planning and obstacle avoidance problem in mobile robots,"Planning a collision-free path in the least processing time and cost within constraints is a central issue in designing an autonomous mobile robot (AMR). Nature-inspired swarm intelligence (NISI) metaheuristic algorithms are gaining popularity in path planning and obstacle avoidance (PPOA) problem in AMRs. An efficient PPOA algorithm's objective encompasses the ability to read a workspace map and consequently create the shortest collision-free path for the robot to manoeuvre from start to goal in the least processing time and effort. The authors have implemented a modified NISI metaheuristic approach known as a Slime Mould Optimization Algorithm (SMOA) in this research. SMOA takes inspiration from the oscillatory nature of slime mould when it encounters prey. Its mathematical model utilizes adaptive weights to simulate an optimal path for capturing prey or food. The slime moulds produce positive and negative feedback while propagating towards food with excellent exploratory competency and exploitation propensity. For this, simulation has been carried out on MATLAB 2020a. Additionally, the performance of SMOA has been compared with other NISI metaheuristic approaches such as PSO, FA, SFLA and ABC. The results demonstrate that modified SMOA takes less time and effort to generate an optimal collision-free path as compared to other mentioned approaches. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85103758742&doi=10.1016%2fj.asoc.2021.107372&partnerID=40&md5=113d1cf72935e20613e23158c6b7db0b,Applied Soft Computing,2021
A Provenance-Aware Distributed Trust Model for Resilient Unmanned Aerial Vehicle Networks,"An unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) network is an emerging industrial IoT network for collaborative UAV communication and management. The open architecture and dynamic topology, which provide functional benefits, unfortunately make UAVNs more vulnerable to a variety of attacks. In UAVNs, malicious nodes not only eavesdrop the communications between UAV nodes but also attempt to attack the entire network by injecting or modifying messages. This work proposes a provenance-aware distributed trust model, named UAV-pro, for UAVNs that aim to achieve accurate peer-to-peer trust assessment and maximize the delivery of correct messages received by destination nodes while minimizing the message delay and communication cost under resource-constrained network environments. Provenance refers to the history of ownership of messages transmitted on the network. The behavior of message creators and operators can be effectively evaluated based on message integrity, then generate the observational evidence. We collect the observational evidence for distributed trust evaluation, then identify malicious nodes in the network and isolate them from the network. UAVN-pro takes a data-driven approach to reduce resource consumption in the presence of selfish or malicious nodes while ensuring the safe transmission of data by digital signature technology. The experimental results show that UAVN-pro works are compatible with the existing UAV network routing protocols, and can effectively identify attacks, such as the black hole, gray hole, message modification, fake recommendation, and fake identity in UAV networks. UAVN-pro is superior to the existing security model in terms of detection rate, delivery rate, and system energy consumption in most cases. © 2014 IEEE.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85099534461&doi=10.1109%2fJIOT.2020.3014947&partnerID=40&md5=ab02aedc0a4ed49b01a5a2614f55acd2,IEEE Internet of Things Journal,2021
Extreme Learning-Based Monocular Visual Servo of an Unmanned Surface Vessel,"In this article, suffering from unmatched visual-servo uncertainties and unknown dynamics/disturbances, an extreme learning-based monocular visual-servo (ELMVS) scheme is developed for maneuvering an unmanned surface vessel (USV) to reach the desired pose. By virtue of the backstepping philosophy, complex visual-servo unknowns are elaborately encapsulated into lumped nonlinearities, which are further accurately accommodated by devising a single-hidden layer feedforward network based adaptive compensating identifier (SACI). Within the SACI architecture, hidden nodes are completely model free and are randomly generated without tedious learning, and thereby dramatically expediting fast-dynamics identification. Moreover, by exploiting approximation residuals, direct hyperbolic-tangent links between input and output layers are deployed to enhance identification accuracy. Eventually, the Lyapunov synthesis guarantees that the proposed ELMVS scheme can asymptotically render visual-servo errors arbitrarily small while target features can be kept within the field of view. Remarkable performance and superiority is finally demonstrated on a prototype USV.  © 2005-2012 IEEE.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85105605985&doi=10.1109%2fTII.2020.3033794&partnerID=40&md5=9b94b86c19e3b72627a70eb9b31a5809,IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics,2021
3D path planning and real-time collision resolution of multirotor drone operations in complex urban low-altitude airspace,"Drones have been greatly developed to facilitate the progress of various industries. The safe operation of drones in the urban airspace is critical to ensure a reliable and high-efficient urban air traffic system. This work presents a fusion scheme to achieve autonomous drone collision-free path planning considering static obstacles and dynamic threats detected. Firstly, a 3D voxel jump point search (JPS) based path planning model is developed to generate the static collision-free reference path. With the optimization, the reference path is then de-diagonalized, reconstructed, and smoothed to obtain the desired path. Subsequently, a local collision resolution method is proposed to avoid near mid-air collision of the dynamic threats. The method is based on the Markov decision process (MDP) to implement real-time dynamic collision avoidance. Simulations are conducted to verify the performance of the proposed model. The simulation results demonstrate that the proposed model is effective to achieve the autonomous path planning and real-time collision resolution of multirotor drones. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85108737873&doi=10.1016%2fj.trc.2021.103123&partnerID=40&md5=9a999011ef81b9f54c4023ce26bc0412,Transportation Research Part C: Emerging Technologies,2021
Softwarized Industrial Deterministic Networking Based on Unmanned Aerial Vehicles,"Guaranteeing network transmission is one of the most challenging issues in industrial informatization. In the industrial sites without proper networking infrastructure, by deploying unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV), transmission-oriented cyber-physical system (CPS) is an excellent candidate to exploit to provide transmission. In this article, we focus on establishing deterministic network transmission (DNT) using UAV-based CPS, complying with the principles in time sensitive network/deterministic networking in industrial internet. The software-defined networking (SDN) paradigm is adopted for UAVs-based CPS to achieve global optimization. First, we build the coordinate-based global topology view in the SDN controller to manage and control UAVs by integrating UAVs into the view and applying the network positioning method. Then, we introduce a hop-limited time synchronization approach to improve accuracy by reducing synchronization deviation. Last, based on the view, a geometric multipath generating method is proposed to enhance reliability by reducing the joint degree of multiple paths and facilitating convergence. The extensive simulation experiments show that our proposed UAV-CPS allows DNT to provide better reliability with reduced latency. © 2005-2012 IEEE.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85105572182&doi=10.1109%2fTII.2020.3032606&partnerID=40&md5=ceaf8a3c7d25f1b45ab9d53bda342a04,IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics,2021
Dynamics and control of a two-ship ensemble connected by a massless towline,"Tugboats are often called upon to rescue disabled ships on open seas. This study represents a fundamental step toward automating the towing mission of disabled vessels. It deals with the control of transient planar dynamics for a two-ship ensemble connected by a massless cable. This is a multibody structure whose components are coupled by non-holonomic inequality constraints. Two control strategies were designed by exploiting the essential temporal scale difference between relative tugboat-ship dynamics induced by the constraints and the relatively slow motion of the mass center of the two-ship ensemble. In the first strategy, the leading ship was controlled to maintain a prescribed heading angle and surge speed for the mass center of the two-ship ensemble while in the second one the leading vessel was controlled to track prescribed set targets for its desired heading angle and surge speed. The first strategy reduces the controller's susceptibility to sharp variations in the towline tension and is suitable for maritime applications involving powered vessels performing cooperative transport of a large floating object. The results demonstrated the viability of the control strategies, proved that the first strategy is as effective as the second one and showed the robustness of controllers to environmental disturbances. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85107801345&doi=10.1016%2fj.oceaneng.2021.109295&partnerID=40&md5=b6fcdaa5e7a302cdfa9c4136ec59f668,Ocean Engineering,2021
Can Offline Testing of Deep Neural Networks Replace Their Online Testing?: A Case Study of Automated Driving Systems,"We distinguish two general modes of testing for Deep Neural Networks (DNNs): Offline testing where DNNs are tested as individual units based on test datasets obtained without involving the DNNs under test, and online testing where DNNs are embedded into a specific application environment and tested in a closed-loop mode in interaction with the application environment. Typically, DNNs are subjected to both types of testing during their development life cycle where offline testing is applied immediately after DNN training and online testing follows after offline testing and once a DNN is deployed within a specific application environment. In this paper, we study the relationship between offline and online testing. Our goal is to determine how offline testing and online testing differ or complement one another and if offline testing results can be used to help reduce the cost of online testing? Though these questions are generally relevant to all autonomous systems, we study them in the context of automated driving systems where, as study subjects, we use DNNs automating end-to-end controls of steering functions of self-driving vehicles. Our results show that offline testing is less effective than online testing as many safety violations identified by online testing could not be identified by offline testing, while large prediction errors generated by offline testing always led to severe safety violations detectable by online testing. Further, we cannot exploit offline testing results to reduce the cost of online testing in practice since we are not able to identify specific situations where offline testing could be as accurate as online testing in identifying safety requirement violations. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85109209891&doi=10.1007%2fs10664-021-09982-4&partnerID=40&md5=d7538003fa6582e26930858cf800340c,Empirical Software Engineering,2021
Secure Estimation and Attack Isolation for Connected and Automated Driving in the Presence of Malicious Vehicles,"Connected and Automated Vehicles (CAVs) rely on the correctness of position and other vehicle kinematics information to fulfill various driving tasks such as vehicle following, lane change, and collision avoidance. However, a malicious vehicle may send false sensor information to the other vehicles intentionally or unintentionally, which may cause traffic inconvenience or loss of human lives. Here, we take the advantage of vehicular cloud and increase the resilience of CAVs to malicious vehicles by assuming each vehicle shares its local sensor information with other vehicles to create information redundancy on the cloud side. We exploit this redundancy and propose a sensor fusion algorithm for the vehicular cloud, capable of providing robust state estimation of all vehicles under the condition that the number of malicious information is sufficiently small. Using the proposed estimator, we provide an algorithm for isolating malicious vehicles. We use numerical examples to illustrate the effectiveness of our methods.  © 1967-2012 IEEE.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85110792944&doi=10.1109%2fTVT.2021.3097096&partnerID=40&md5=3e4008427ed77d8e9094114fd1ed9392,IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology,2021

BDFL: A Byzantine-Fault-Tolerance Decentralized Federated Learning Method for Autonomous Vehicle,"Autonomous Vehicles (AVs) take advantage of Machine Learning (ML) for yielding improved experiences of self-driving. However, large-scale collection of AVs' data for training will inevitably result in a privacy leakage problem. Federated Learning (FL) is proposed to solve privacy leakage problems, but it is exposed to security threats such as model inversion, membership inference. Therefore, the vulnerability of the FL should be brought to the forefront when applying to AVs. We propose a novel Byzantine-Fault-Tolerant (BFT) decentralized FL method with privacy-preservation for AVs called BDFL. In this paper, a Peer-to-Peer (P2P) FL with BFT is built by extending the HydRand protocol. In order to protect their model, each AV uses the Publicly Verifiable Secret Sharing(PVSS) scheme, which allows anyone to verify the correctness of encrypted shares. The evaluation results on the MNIST dataset have shown that introducing decentralized FL into AV area is feasible, and the proposed BDFL is superior to other BFT-based FL method. Furthermore, the experimental results on KITTI dataset indicate the practicality of BDFL on improving performances of multi-object recognition in AV areas. Finally, the proposed PVSS-based data privacy preservation scheme is also justified its characteristic of no side-effect on models' parameters by the experiments on the MNIST and KITTI datasets. © 1967-2012 IEEE.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85112619329&doi=10.1109%2fTVT.2021.3102121&partnerID=40&md5=b97739ed639a54520fe998bfd6130b7e,IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology,2021
A Homography-Based Dynamic Control Approach Applied to Station Keeping of Autonomous Underwater Vehicles without Linear Velocity Measurements,"A homography-based dynamic control approach applied to station keeping of autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs) without relying on linear velocity measurements is proposed. The homography estimated from images of a planar target scene captured by a downward-looking camera is directly used as feedback information. The full dynamics of the AUV are exploited in a hierarchical control design with inner and outer loop architectures. Enhanced by integral compensation actions and disturbance torque estimation, the proposed controller is robust with respect to model uncertainties and unknown currents. The performance of the proposed control approach is illustrated using both comparative simulation results conducted on a realistic AUV model and experimental validations on an in-house AUV.  © 1993-2012 IEEE.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85112781934&doi=10.1109%2fTCST.2020.3029564&partnerID=40&md5=464715d1256bc0d66f881dd34948d71a,IEEE Transactions on Control Systems Technology,2021
Behavioral Harmonization of a Cyclic Vehicular Platoon in a Closed Road Network,"This paper presents a method to dynamically harmonize the behaviors of cyclic vehicular platoons in a closed road network. Different from the open-chain counterpart, a cyclic platoon formulates a traffic flow ring constrained by interconnection coupling feature and finite-length geometry, which brings challenges for platoon control design and analysis. First, by exploiting the circulant structure of homogeneous cyclic platoons, the closed-loop dynamics is decomposed into a set of decoupled systems with the same low dimension as a single vehicle. Based on this decomposition, an analytical necessary and sufficient stability condition is derived for the design of distributed feedback controllers. This necessary and sufficient condition is further relaxed into sufficient conditions to remove the dependence on the platoon size. Next, the string stability is proved with the sufficient conditions derived above based on frequency-domain analysis. Then, based on integral sliding mode control, we prove that heterogeneous vehicles can behave like homogeneous ones so that the results on homogeneous cyclic platoons can be extended to heterogeneous cyclic platoons. Finally, the equilibrium velocity and spacing errors are derived to explain the effect of geometry conditions on the steady-state behavior. Numerical simulations using both linear and nonlinear vehicle models are conducted to validate our findings.  © 2021 IEEE.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85101813360&doi=10.1109%2fTIV.2021.3062397&partnerID=40&md5=887bc7e18c1099a10c389b719e9c1730,IEEE Transactions on Intelligent Vehicles,2021
Two-level K-nearest neighbors approach for invasive plants detection and classification,"Invasive plants (IPs) are considered major threat to biodiversity and ecosystems due to their potential to compete for resources with other plants or crops. Timely and effective detection is important to prevent and control their growth. Recent advancements in unmanned aerial systems (UAS) have brought an effective, inexpensive, and non-invasive approach to monitoring plants. The use of UAS is promising in the accurate and rapid identification of IPs in the field. However, challenges exist when using UAS for IP detection as they generate a huge number of images that must be interpreted by researchers manually. This time-consuming and error-prone process significantly limits the applicability of UAS in a variety of environmental and agriculture monitoring applications. To reduce processing time and increase detection accuracy, we develop an automatic and intelligent detection approach to identify IPs with high levels of efficiency and accuracy from images of the monitoring areas captured by UAS. First, the original field images are segmented into patch images using the simple linear iterative clustering (SLIC) superpixels algorithm. Then a novel two-level K-nearest neighbors (TLKNN) algorithm is proposed to classify the patch images into different IP categories. In it, a deep convolutional neural network (CNN) is used to extract the features from the patch image and a kernel map function is utilized to obtain the kernel features. Two feature sets are fed to train two K-nearest neighbor (KNN) models. Finally, the final classification is determined by the selection results by KNN models. In the experiments, two public UAV image sets are employed to train and verify the proposed method. Several metrics such as accuracy, recall, precision, and F1-score, are used to evaluate the performance. The proposed TLKNN is compared with two newly proposed convolutional neural network (CNN) methods on the same datasets. Experimental results indicate the proposed TLKNN algorithm achieves better classification performance and reaches the highest accuracy, recall rate, precision rate, and F1-score. The improved performance not only means that IPs can be detected more accurately and automatically, but also that there are environmental benefits in developing an intelligent strategy for IP prevention and control. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85107701290&doi=10.1016%2fj.asoc.2021.107523&partnerID=40&md5=baa3533bdb77c867cca0b48f09c09065,Applied Soft Computing,2021
ADGAN: Protect Your Location Privacy in Camera Data of Auto-Driving Vehicles,"Computer vision and deep neural networks have been significantly promoting the development of visual perception in these years. Particularly, for autonomous vehicles, real-time image/video data is captured by onboard cameras and analyzed by computer vision techniques in many real applications. In the captured camera data, some contents can be used as auxiliary information to infer individuals' locations and trajectories, which leads to severe privacy leakage but has been rarely studied. Thus, the goal of this article is to protect individuals' location privacy by hiding side-channel information in the captured data while preserving the data utility for downstream applications. To this end, the technology of generative adversarial networks (GAN) is utilized to design two novel models, named ADGAN-I and ADGAN-II, both of which can take the original camera data as inputs and generate privacy-preserving outputs according to predefined sensitive object class. Thus, the processed camera data can defend location inference attack from adversaries in offline applications. Moreover, in ADGAN-I and ADGAN-II, the tradeoff between location privacy and data utility can be effectively balanced. Finally, the results of extensive real-data experiments validate the superiority of our proposed models over the state of the arts in utility preservation and privacy protection for autonomous vehicles' images and videos.  © 2005-2012 IEEE.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85112344810&doi=10.1109%2fTII.2020.3032352&partnerID=40&md5=5f4e0d5fa8c84c6080a848be8dcd4466,IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics,2021
Cyclic Communication in Adaptive Strategies to Platooning: The Case of Synchronized Merging,"Recently proposed adaptive platooning strategies for connected automated vehicles are able to address uncertain parameters of the vehicles in the platoon (uncertain driveline time constants), but are limited to acyclic interaction like look-ahead interaction. This restrains from augmenting platooning protocols with synchronized merging maneuvers, where cyclic communication is needed and creates algebraic loops that require well posedness of the inputs. We propose an adaptive protocol for synchronized merging in the cyclic communication scenario. The protocol exploits a set of adaptive control strategies, designed to cope with uncertain driveline time constants. Well-posedness of the control inputs is proven in a distributed way (using information from neighboring vehicles) in spite of uncertainty and cyclic communication. The proposed strategy is shown in a benchmark merging scenario.  © 2020 IEEE.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85097412823&doi=10.1109%2fTIV.2020.3041702&partnerID=40&md5=94d8ab0c70fe0421b599a5fa28059d0f,IEEE Transactions on Intelligent Vehicles,2021
String Stability of a Vehicular Platoon with the Use of Macroscopic Information,"The paper investigates the possibility of using macroscopic information to improve control performance of a vehicular platoon composed of autonomous vehicles.

Examples of mesoscopic control laws are illustrated and simulations show the effectiveness of our approach in ensuring String Stability and improving the platoon behavior.  © 2000-2011 IEEE.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85100868337&doi=10.1109%2fTITS.2021.3056237&partnerID=40&md5=8a3241b477adf67d1058598722f6061c,IEEE Transactions on Intelligent Transportation Systems,2021
Robust Set-Invariance Based Fuzzy Output Tracking Control for Vehicle Autonomous Driving under Uncertain Lateral Forces and Steering Constraints,"This paper is concerned with a new control method for path tracking of autonomous ground vehicles. We exploit the fuzzy model-based control framework to deal with the time-varying feature of the vehicle speed and the highly uncertain behaviors of the tire-road forces involved in the nonlinear vehicle dynamics. To avoid using costly vehicle sensors for feedback control while favoring the simplest control structure for real-time implementation, a new fuzzy static output feedback (SOF) scheme is proposed. In particular, though the robust set-invariance property and Lyapunov-based arguments, the physical constraints on the steering input saturation and the vehicle state can be taken into account in the control design to improve the driving safety and comfort. The theoretical development relies on the use of fuzzy Lyapunov functions and the non-parallel distributed compensation control concept to reduce the design conservatism. Exploiting some specific convexification techniques, the control design is reformulated as an optimization problem under linear matrix inequalities with a single line search, which are efficiently solved via semidefinite programming techniques. The proposed fuzzy path tracking controller is evaluated through various dynamic driving tests conducted with high-fidelity CarSim/Matlab co-simulations. Moreover, to emphasize the advantages of the new fuzzy SOF controller, a performance comparison with the CarSim driver model is also performed.  © 2000-2011 IEEE.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85114378158&doi=10.1109%2fTITS.2020.3021292&partnerID=40&md5=61aa23dd259967133e6260609fdfb59a,IEEE Transactions on Intelligent Transportation Systems,2021
Adopting automated whitelist approach for detecting phishing attacks,"Phishing is considered a great scourge in cyberspace. Presently, there are two major challenges known with the existing anti-phishing solutions. Low detection rate and lack of quick access time in a real-time environment. However, it has been established that blacklist solution methods offer quick and immediate access time but with a low detection rate. This research paper presents an automated white-list approach for detecting phishing attacks. The white-list is determined by carrying out a detailed analysis between the visual link and the actual link. The similarities of the known trusted site are calculated by juxtaposing the domain name with the contents of the whitelist and later match it with the IP address before a decision is made and further analyzing the actual link and the visual link by calculating the similarities of the known trusted site. The technique then takes a final decision on the extracted information from the hyperlink, which can also be obtained from the web address provided by the user. The experiments carried out provided a very high level of accuracy, specifically, when the dataset was relatively at the lowest level. Six different datasets were used to perform the experiments. The average accuracy obtained after the six experiments was 96.17% and the approach detects phishing sites with a 95.0% true positive rate. It was observed that the level of accuracy varies from one dataset to another. This result shows that the proposed method performs better than similar approaches benchmarked with. The efficiency of the approach was further established through its computation time, memory, bandwidth as well as other computational resources that were utilized with the minimum requirements when compared with other approaches. This solution has provided immense benefits over the existing solutions by reducing the memory requirements and computational complexity, among other benefits. It has also shown that the proposed method can provide more robust detection performances when compared to other techniques. © 2021",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85107530292&doi=10.1016%2fj.cose.2021.102328&partnerID=40&md5=73a3b4081ea9af1b006fadc6f7aa63a6,Computers and Security,2021
The Optimal and the Greedy: Drone Association and Positioning Schemes for Internet of UAVs,"This work considers the deployment of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) over a predefined area to serve a number of ground users. Due to the heterogeneous nature of the network, the UAVs may cause severe interference to the transmissions of each other. Hence, a judicious design of the user-UAV association and UAV locations is desired. A potential game is defined where the players are the UAVs. The potential function is the total sum rate of the users. The agents' utility in the potential game is their marginal contribution to the global welfare or their so-called wonderful life utility. A game-theoretic learning algorithm, binary log-linear learning (BLLL), is then applied to the problem. Given the potential game structure, a consequence of our utility design, the stochastically stable states using BLLL are guaranteed to be the potential maximizers. Hence, we optimally solve the joint user-UAV association and 3-D-location problem. Next, we exploit the submodular features of the sum rate function for a given configuration of UAVs to design an efficient greedy algorithm. Despite the simplicity of the greedy algorithm, it comes with a performance guarantee of $1-1/e$ of the optimal solution. To further reduce the number of iterations, we propose another heuristic greedy algorithm that provides very good results. Our simulations show that, in practice, the proposed greedy approaches achieve significant performance in a few iterations. © 2014 IEEE.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85103760235&doi=10.1109%2fJIOT.2021.3070209&partnerID=40&md5=e7169dfaff5a67f13848abefdbf678fd,IEEE Internet of Things Journal,2021
Robust Orientation-Sensitive Trajectory Tracking of Underactuated Autonomous Underwater Vehicles,"Orientation-sensitive trajectory tracking (OSTT) claims that both position and orientation of the autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs) are regulated to the reference. This article addresses the OSTT controller design problem for AUVs with separate forces or torques for surge, heave, roll, and yaw, in the presence of hydrodynamic uncertainties and external disturbances. In the kinematic stage, these AUVs are capable of moving sideways by exploiting the nonzero angle of the roll, so that the position tracking can be handled while the steering tracks the referenced yaw angle. As for the kinetic stage, a robust nonsmooth controller is implemented to guarantee the exponential convergence of velocity tracking errors. Trajectories are planned for the docking task and bridge pier inspection task. It is shown that the position tracking error can converge to a neighborhood about zero, and the yaw angle tracking error converges to zero exponentially as well. The effectiveness of the proposed method is illustrated by both simulation results and experimental results. © 1982-2012 IEEE.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85102106911&doi=10.1109%2fTIE.2020.3013790&partnerID=40&md5=21bfca94df9efa21fd5a7e96320a1c74,IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics,2021
Partially Observable Monte Carlo Planning with state variable constraints for mobile robot navigation,"Autonomous mobile robots employed in industrial applications often operate in complex and uncertain environments. In this paper we propose an approach based on an extension of Partially Observable Monte Carlo Planning (POMCP) for robot velocity regulation in industrial-like environments characterized by uncertain motion difficulties. The velocity selected by POMCP is used by a standard engine controller which deals with path planning. This two-layer approach allows POMCP to exploit prior knowledge on the relationships between task similarities to improve performance in terms of time spent to traverse a path with obstacles. We also propose three measures to support human-understanding of the strategy used by POMCP to improve the performance. The overall architecture is tested on a Turtlebot3 in two environments, a rectangular path and a realistic production line in a research lab. Tests performed on a C++ simulator confirm the capability of the proposed approach to profitably use prior knowledge, achieving a performance improvement from 0.7% to 3.1% depending on the complexity of the path. Experiments on a Unity simulator show that the proposed two-layer approach outperforms also single-layer approaches based only on the engine controller (i.e., without the POMCP layer). In this case the performance improvement is up to 37% comparing to a state-of-the-art deep reinforcement learning engine controller, and up to 51% comparing to the standard ROS engine controller. Finally, experiments in a real-world testing arena confirm the possibility to run the approach on real robots. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85111045874&doi=10.1016%2fj.engappai.2021.104382&partnerID=40&md5=5c2a3184639273d96da58ae804e30d98,Engineering Applications of Artificial Intelligence,2021
Unsupervised anomaly detection for underwater gliders using generative adversarial networks,"An effective anomaly detection system is critical for marine autonomous systems operating in complex and dynamic marine environments to reduce operational costs and achieve concurrent large-scale fleet deployments. However, developing an automated fault detection system remains challenging for several reasons including limited data transmission via satellite services. Currently, most anomaly detection for marine autonomous systems, such as underwater gliders, rely on intensive analysis by pilots. This study proposes an unsupervised anomaly detection system using bidirectional generative adversarial networks guided by assistive hints for marine autonomous systems with time series data collected by multiple sensors. In this study, the anomaly detection system for a fleet of underwater gliders is trained on two healthy deployment datasets and tested on other nine deployment datasets collected by a selection of vehicles operating in a range of locations and environmental conditions. The system is successfully applied to detect anomalies in the nine test deployments, which include several different types of anomalies as well as healthy behaviour. Also, a sensitivity study of the data decimation settings suggests the proposed system is robust for Near Real-Time anomaly detection for underwater gliders. © 2021",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85109775719&doi=10.1016%2fj.engappai.2021.104379&partnerID=40&md5=d928e564c82449570a4e41df559b18f8,Engineering Applications of Artificial Intelligence,2021
IPMGAN: Integrating physical model and generative adversarial network for underwater image enhancement,"Autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs) highly depend on the quality of captured underwater images to perform a variety of tasks. However, compared with everyday images taken in air, underwater images are hazy, with color shift, and in relatively low quality, posing significant challenges to available mature vision algorithms to achieve expected performance. There are, currently, two major lines of approaches to tackle these challenges: the physical image formation model-based and the neural-network-based approaches. In this paper, we propose an integrated approach, where the revised underwater image formation model, i.e., the Akkaynak-Treibitz model, is embedded into the network design for the benefit of combining the advantages of these two approaches. The embedded physical model guides for network learning, and the generative adversarial network (GAN) is adopted for coefficients estimation. We conduct extensive experiments and compare with state-of-the-art approaches quantitatively and qualitatively on nearly all the available underwater datasets, and our method achieves significant improvements. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85096010638&doi=10.1016%2fj.neucom.2020.07.130&partnerID=40&md5=682efa27527715735f754fd65681ca4f,Neurocomputing,2021
Efficient Resource Allocation for Multi-UAV Communication against Adjacent and Co-Channel Interference,"Unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) swarm has emerged as a promising novel paradigm to achieve better coverage and higher capacity for future wireless network by exploiting the more favorable line-of-sight (LoS) propagation. To reap the potential gains of UAV swarm, the remote control signal sent by ground control unit (GCU) is essential, whereas the control signal quality are susceptible in practice due to the effect of the adjacent channel interference (ACI) and the external interference (EI) from radiation sources distributed across the region. To tackle these challenges, this paper considers priority-aware resource coordination in a multi-UAV communication system, where multiple UAVs are controlled by a GCU to perform certain tasks with a pre-defined trajectory. Specifically, we maximize the minimum signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR) among all the UAVs by jointly optimizing channel assignment and power allocation strategy under stringent resource availability constraints. According to the intensity of ACI, we consider the corresponding problem in two scenarios, i.e., Null-ACI and ACI systems. By virtue of the particular problem structure in Null-ACI case, we first recast the formulation into an equivalent yet more tractable form and obtain the global optimal solution via Hungarian algorithm. For general ACI systems, we develop an efficient iterative algorithm for its solution based on the alternating optimization methods. Extensive simulation results demonstrate that the proposed algorithms can significantly enhance the minimum SINR among all the UAVs and adapt the allocation of communication resources to diverse mission priority. © 1967-2012 IEEE.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85112498363&doi=10.1109%2fTVT.2021.3104279&partnerID=40&md5=2188aaa396aea7683e2fd862e6c4dcd5,IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology,2021
WhONet: Wheel Odometry neural Network for vehicular localisation in GNSS-deprived environments,"In this paper, a deep learning approach is proposed to accurately position wheeled vehicles in Global Navigation Satellite Systems (GNSS) deprived environments. In the absence of GNSS signals, information on the speed of the wheels of a vehicle (or other robots alike), recorded from the wheel encoder, can be used to provide continuous positioning information for the vehicle, through the integration of the vehicle's linear velocity to displacement. However, the displacement estimation from the wheel speed measurements are characterised by uncertainties, which could be manifested as wheel slips or/and changes to the tyre size or pressure, from wet and muddy road drives or tyres wearing out. As such, we exploit recent advances in deep learning to propose the Wheel Odometry neural Network (WhONet) to learn the uncertainties in the wheel speed measurements needed for correction and accurate positioning. The performance of the proposed WhONet is first evaluated on several challenging driving scenarios, such as on roundabouts, sharp cornering, hard-brake and wet roads (drifts). WhONet's performance is then further and extensively evaluated on longer-term GNSS outage scenarios of 30 s, 60 s, 120 s and 180 s duration, respectively over a total distance of 493 km. The experimental results obtained show that the proposed method is able to accurately position the vehicle with up to 93% reduction in the positioning error of its original counterpart (physics model) after any 180 s of travel. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85114125955&doi=10.1016%2fj.engappai.2021.104421&partnerID=40&md5=4b048f0a2b6ff9b7db45fec78e768bca,Engineering Applications of Artificial Intelligence,2021
Prediction of Motion Simulator Signals Using Time-Series Neural Networks,"A motion cueing algorithm (MCA) is employed to transform the linear and angular motion signals generated from a motion simulator without violating the physical and dynamical boundaries of the motion platform. In this respect, the accurate prediction of the motion scenarios is essential to enhance the efficiency of the MCA using prepositioning or time-varying reference model predictive control. While a recent approach that utilizes a feedforward neural network (NN) to forecast the motion scenarios is useful, the feedforward NN model has only forward dynamics relating to the signals without any feedback loop. In this article, a time-delay feedforward NN, a recurrent NN, and a nonlinear autoregressive (NAR) models with three different training procedures, i.e., Levenberg-Marquardt, Bayesian regularization, and scaled conjugate gradient, are exploited to predict the motion scenarios. As the NAR model employs the historical signals as the inputs, it can predict the motion scenarios with higher accuracy rates. Based on the series of empirical evaluations, NAR trained with Levenberg-Marquardt is able to outperform the other two counterparts in producing more accurate predictions of the motion signals. The NAR method has a lower computational load as compared with that of the recurrent NN, facilitating its real-time application. In addition to the MCA, the NAR method can be employed in other areas, including autonomous vehicles and motion sickness studies. It can also be easily implemented for air, sea, and/or land vehicle simulators for training purposes in virtual reality environments.  © 1965-2011 IEEE.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85107178811&doi=10.1109%2fTAES.2021.3082662&partnerID=40&md5=17fec9c046de110de22c25fa911f5424,IEEE Transactions on Aerospace and Electronic Systems,2021
Moving Object Segmentation in 3D LiDAR Data: A Learning-Based Approach Exploiting Sequential Data,"The ability to detect and segment moving objects in a scene is essential for building consistent maps, making future state predictions, avoiding collisions, and planning. In this letter, we address the problem of moving object segmentation from 3D LiDAR scans. We propose a novel approach that pushes the current state of the art in LiDAR-only moving object segmentation forward to provide relevant information for autonomous robots and other vehicles. Instead of segmenting the point cloud semantically, i.e., predicting the semantic classes such as vehicles, pedestrians, roads, etc., our approach accurately segments the scene into moving and static objects, i.e., also distinguishing between moving cars vs. parked cars. Our proposed approach exploits sequential range images from a rotating 3D LiDAR sensor as an intermediate representation combined with a convolutional neural network and runs faster than the frame rate of the sensor. We compare our approach to several other state-of-the-art methods showing superior segmentation quality in urban environments. Additionally, we created a new benchmark for LiDAR-based moving object segmentation based on SemanticKITTI. We published it to allow other researchers to compare their approaches transparently and we furthermore published our code.  © 2016 IEEE.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85111136417&doi=10.1109%2fLRA.2021.3093567&partnerID=40&md5=2afba8541966bfff1b118c36fd4ae571,IEEE Robotics and Automation Letters,2021
Intelligent Traffic Network Control in the Era of Internet of Vehicles,"In the era of internet of vehicles, both the traffic signal control and the rerouting of connected and autonomous vehicles (CAVs) are essential techniques to alleviate traffic congestion and improve traffic efficiency. However, these two schemes have been treated separately without a unified framework allowing for joint optimization in the previous studies. In the case of traffic congestion at the bottleneck intersections, either of the two schemes alone is not enough. To this end, we propose to jointly control the traffic lights and the CAVs under the reinforcement learning (RL) framework. To lower the dimensionality of this learning problem, we propose to control the route choices of the CAVs through a few common scalar parameters instead of controlling the CAVs individually. In particular, the rerouting ratios are dynamically adjusted. A model-based method is further proposed to estimate the expected travel time with reduced estimation error. We then exploit the tools from deep RL and put forth an efficient algorithm that is able to control the green time allocation of traffic signals and the rerouting of CAVs jointly. Comprehensive numerical experiments demonstrate the validity of our proposed models and show the traffic efficiency can be significantly improved with our proposed algorithm.  © 1967-2012 IEEE.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85113264178&doi=10.1109%2fTVT.2021.3105478&partnerID=40&md5=9c56d3350c42bfd751f5348e7bbf2de2,IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology,2021
Aerial Vehicles Tracking Using Noncoherent Crowdsourced Wireless Networks,"Air traffic management (ATM) of manned and unmanned aerial vehicles (AVs) relies critically on ubiquitous location tracking. While technologies exist for AVs to broadcast their location periodically and for airports to track and detect AVs, methods to verify the broadcast locations and complement the ATM coverage are urgently needed, addressing anti-spoofing and safe coexistence concerns. In this work, we propose an ATM solution by exploiting noncoherent crowdsourced wireless networks (CWNs) and correcting the inherent clock-synchronization problems present in such non-coordinated sensor networks. While CWNs can provide a great number of measurements for ubiquitous ATM, these are normally obtained from unsynchronized sensors. This article first presents an analysis of the effects of lack of clock synchronization in ATM with CWN and provides solutions based on the presence of few trustworthy sensors in a large non-coordinated network. Secondly, autoregressive-based and long short-term memory (LSTM)-based approaches are investigated to achieve the time synchronization needed for localization of the AVs. Finally, a combination of a multilateration (MLAT) method and a Kalman filter is employed to provide an anti-spoofing tracking solution for AVs. We demonstrate the performance advantages of our framework through a dataset collected by a real-world CWN. Our results show that the proposed framework achieves localization accuracy comparable to that acquired using only GPS-synchronized sensors and outperforms the localization accuracy obtained based on state-of-the-art CWN synchronization methods.  © 1967-2012 IEEE.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85112535270&doi=10.1109%2fTVT.2021.3103315&partnerID=40&md5=1018acfac76049061251eb322b218f35,IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology,2021
Securing Mobile Multiuser Transmissions with UAVs in the Presence of Multiple Eavesdroppers,"This paper analyzes the problem of securing the transmissions of multiple mobile users against eavesdropping attacks. We propose and optimize the deployment of a single unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV), which serves as an aerial relay (AR) between the user cluster and the base station. The focus is on maximizing the secrecy energy efficiency by jointly optimizing the uplink transmission powers of the ground users and the position of the UAV. The joint optimization problem is nonconvex; therefore we split it into two subproblems and solve them using an iterative algorithm. © 1967-2012 IEEE.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85117470604&doi=10.1109%2fTVT.2021.3103525&partnerID=40&md5=1100fe9a93773ece13f4f0bfd66ea62e,IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology,2021
3D robotic navigation using a vision-based deep reinforcement learning model,"In this paper, we address a problem of vision-based 3D robotic navigation using deep reinforcement learning for an Autonomous Underwater Vehicle (AUV). Our research offers conclusions from the experimental study based on one of the RoboSub 2018 competition tasks. However, it can be generalized to any navigation task consisting of movement from a starting point to the front of the next station. The presented reinforcement learning-based model predicts the robot's steering settings using the data acquired from the robot's sensors. Its Vision Module may be based on a built-in convolutional network or a pre-trained TinyYOLO network so that a comparison of various levels of features’ complexity is possible. To enable evaluation of the proposed solution, we prepared a test environment imitating the real conditions. It provides the ability to steer the agent simulating the AUV and calculate values of rewards, used for training the model by evaluating its decisions. We study the solution in terms of the reward function form, the model's hyperparameters and the exploited camera images processing method, and provide an analysis of the correctness and speed of the model's functioning. As a result, we obtain a valid model able to steer the robot from the starting point to the destination based on visual cues and inputs from other sensors. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85108122728&doi=10.1016%2fj.asoc.2021.107602&partnerID=40&md5=a6e54a7e357f61ed60f1f6b95fb09b4f,Applied Soft Computing,2021
Real-Time Flight Simulation of Hydrobatic AUVs over the Full 0°-360° Envelope,"Hydrobatic AUVsare very agile, and can perform challenging maneuvers that encompass the full 0°-360° flight envelope. Such AUVs can be beneficial in novel use cases in ocean production, environmental sensing, and security, by enabling new capabilities for docking, inspection, or under-ice operations. To further explore their capabilities in such scenarios, it is crucial to be able to model their flight dynamics over the full envelope, which includes strong nonlinear effects and turbulence at high angles of attack. With accurate and efficient simulation models, new hydrobatic maneuvers can be generated and control strategies can be developed. Therefore, this article contributes with a strategy to perform efficient and accurate simulations of hydrobatic maneuvers in real time. A multifidelity hydrodynamic database is synthesized by combining analytical, semiempirical, and numerical methods, thereby capturing fluid forces and moments over the full envelope. A component buildup workflow is used to assemble a nonlinear flight dynamics model using lookup tables generated from the database. This simulation model is used to perform real-time simulations of advanced hydrobatic maneuvers. Simulation results show agreement with literature and experiment, and the simulator shows utility as a development tool in designing new maneuvers and control strategies.  © 1976-2012 IEEE.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85112635541&doi=10.1109%2fJOE.2021.3076178&partnerID=40&md5=c5fc752fd30fc5620533dc1ca40f30f4,IEEE Journal of Oceanic Engineering,2021
Exploring software defined networks for seamless handovers in vehicular networks,"With the growing interest in autonomous driving, constant connectivity for vehicles is becoming essential to enable the complete knowledge of the surrounding area, transmit and receive data that is crucial for the autonomous control. The vehicle mobility results in frequent service interruptions, and therefore, seamless handovers are required to mitigate this problem. Several IP-based solutions have been proposed in the literature, but they require tunneling approaches, which present excessive signaling and data overhead, service delay, and packet loss. One of these approaches, the NEMO-enabled Proxy Mobile IPv6 (N-PMIPv6) architecture, supports transparent handovers and simultaneous multi-homing, but at the cost of a high complexity and network overhead. This work explores the flexibility of Software Defined Networks (SDNs) in the management of a Vehicular Ad-hoc NETwork (VANET). In particular, the SDN concept is used to provide a seamless horizontal handover for the vehicle and its end-users. Two different SDN architectures are proposed, evaluating the impact of the depth of the softwarization environment. Real vehicular hardware and emulated mobility scenarios are used in the evaluation process where different application services are exploited. Results show that the lower complexity of the SDN solution allows for a better performance during a handover in a VANET, in terms of delays, packet losses and network overhead, making it seamless for the vehicles and its users. © 2021 Elsevier Inc.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85107835442&doi=10.1016%2fj.vehcom.2021.100372&partnerID=40&md5=f3f66663437c1b548d8199291fbe8ced,Vehicular Communications,2021
The object-oriented dynamic task assignment for unmanned surface vessels,"This paper investigates the task assignment and guidance issues of unmanned surface vessels (USVs) interception. When the USVs formation is invaded by some moving objects during its escort, it is necessary for the unmanned systems to assign defenders to prevent attackers approaching the vulnerable target in antagonistic scenarios. This action requires efficient guidance and task assignment strategies. With this in mind, this paper presents the Integral Proportional Navigation Guidance (IPNG) with Tabu Dynamic Consensus-Based Auction Algorithm (TDCBAA) in marine interception scenario. First, IPNG is introduced in the interception game considering the USV kinematic model, which can effectively reduce the individual interception time. Second, a new bidding function is designed for moving objects interception with the consideration of the attackers’ types, positions and interception time. Finally, a TDCBAA is designed to solve the task assignment subproblem, resulting in a shorter overall interception time and a higher interception success rate. Simulations demonstrate that the proposed algorithm can optimize the allocation of defenders in real-time and intercept the attackers more quickly compared with other classical algorithms, which is more suitable in situations where attackers are approaching from all directions. © 2021",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85117215229&doi=10.1016%2fj.engappai.2021.104476&partnerID=40&md5=0151417a209bd202a1d3f5817e07c673,Engineering Applications of Artificial Intelligence,2021
S-maps: Scalable mutual authentication protocol for dynamic uav swarms,"Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) domain has seen rapid developments in recent years. UAVs have been deployed for many applications and missions like data transmission, cellular service provisioning, and computational offloading tasks etc. Yet, UAV deployment is still limited, partially owing to the security challenges it poses. UAVs are particularly vulnerable to physical capture, cloning attacks, eavesdropping, and man in the middle attacks. To address some of these security problems, this paper develops an authentication protocol for use in UAV swarms. To ensure physical security and rapid authentication, the proposed protocol uses Physical Unclonable Functions (PUFs). The protocol achieves high scalability compared to the state of the art by authenticating multiple devices at once. The proposed protocol supports dynamic topologies and multi-hop communication by using spanning tree-based traversal. It is also resistant to mobility, device tampering attack, etc., and its improvements are achieved at significantly lower communication and communication cost as compared to state-of-the-art protocols.  © 2021 IEEE.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85120339931&doi=10.1109%2fTVT.2021.3116163&partnerID=40&md5=58574cb572450e1404fb4524646def9e,IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology,2021
Autonomous Vehicle: Security by Design,"Security of (semi)-autonomous vehicles is a growing concern, first, due to the increased exposure of the functionality to potential attackers; second, due to the reliance of functionalities on diverse (semi)-autonomous systems; third, due to the interaction of a single-vehicle with myriads of other smart systems in urban traffic infrastructure. Beyond these technical issues, we argue that the security-by-design principle for smart and complex autonomous systems, such as an Autonomous Vehicle (AV) is poorly understood and rarely practiced. Unlike traditional IT systems, where the risk mitigation techniques and adversarial models are well studied and developed with security design principles such as security perimeter and defense-in-depth, the lack of such a framework for connected autonomous systems is plaguing the design and implementation of a secure AV. We attempt to identify the core issues of securing an AV. This is done methodically by developing a security-by-design framework for AV from the first principles. Subsequently, the technical challenges for AV security are identified.  © 2000-2011 IEEE.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85118825860&doi=10.1109%2fTITS.2020.3000797&partnerID=40&md5=5aca4524e7c0e21145ba6766beafa74d,IEEE Transactions on Intelligent Transportation Systems,2021
Deep reinforcement learning based multi-AUVs cooperative decision-making for attack–defense confrontation missions,"This paper mainly focuses on using deep reinforcement learning (RL) to deal with the cooperative decision-making problem of multiple Autonomous Underwater Vehicles (multi-AUVs) under limited perception and limited communication in attack–defense confrontation missions. Firstly, a novel Coding-Convolutional Network (CCN) is proposed, which can encode the raw sensor information of AUVs and extract representative features from limited perception. Secondly, utilizing the approximator of the state value function and policy function composed of CCN and fully connected network, we put forward a centralized decision-making architecture for multi-AUVs system based on actor–critic framework and give the corresponding algorithm combined with asynchronous training. Moreover, with respect to multi-AUVs attack–defense confrontation tasks, we develop a simulation platform to train and evaluate the proposed algorithms under different parameters. It can be directly observed from the visualization of the simulation that the algorithm enables multi-AUVs to complete the attack–defense confrontation missions excellently and generate some interesting collaborative behaviors. The average winning probability data of the simulation results also indicate that the designed method is feasible for multi-AUVs to achieve cooperative decision-making in attack–defense confrontation missions. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85114845423&doi=10.1016%2fj.oceaneng.2021.109794&partnerID=40&md5=61004e6e29d9f4fe1204575d68e29ad9,Ocean Engineering,2021
In-Vehicle Infotainment Systems: Using Bayesian Networks to Model Cognitive Selection of Music Genres,"In the world of transportation, the ceaseless evolution of Information and Communication Technologies (ICT) is reflected on their migration towards In-Vehicle-Infotainment (IVI) systems, which are characterized by innovative applications and services. Such systems aim to support drivers/passengers with a varying set of functions, enhancing the quality of driving through entertainment. The goal of this study is to introduce a novel IVI cognitive functionality that automatically and dynamically proposes the optimal music genre to the drivers/users when they want to make a certain journey with their owned (or shared) vehicles.

An Efficient Strategy for Accurate Detection and Localization of UAV Swarms,"Unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) swarms have shown great potential for Internet of Things (IoT). Meantime, its malicious use may cause huge threat to the national security. UAV swarms show the characteristic of high density which poses formidable challenges to radar resolution in the defense of critical areas. In this article, we consider a radar equipped with the coprime array, and then, use the coherent long-time integration (LTI) technique and gridless sparse technique to detect and localize UAVs in a swarm. This strategy takes full account of advantages of the coprime array, coherent LTI technique, and gridless sparse technique, i.e.: 1) the coprime array can provide a larger array aperture than the uniform linear array with the same number of array elements to relieve the stress of the gridless sparse technique and 2) the combination of coherent LTI technique and gridless sparse technique can maximize their advantages and make up for their shortcomings. By mathematical analyses and extensive numerical examples, we show the superiority of the proposed strategy in terms of accurate detection and localization of UAV swarms.  © 2014 IEEE.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85102636857&doi=10.1109%2fJIOT.2021.3064376&partnerID=40&md5=991a11bf5fb168959c0fe4bb71bf0d44,IEEE Internet of Things Journal,2021
Inverse-model intelligent control of fin-actuated underwater robots based on drag force propulsion,"Fin-actuated underwater robots usually control motion by changing the locomotion primitives of the fins, such as frequency, amplitude, phase shift, or in more complicated cases also the angle of attack. Modelling the generated thrust by an oscillating fin results in a highly non-linear model, thus making it difficult to derive a respective inverse model. In this work, we derived a dynamic model relating the generated thrust to the fins oscillating amplitude and frequency, and proposed the associated inverse-model. The proposed model's accuracy is evaluated by comparing both the theoretical and measured generated thrust for various frequencies. Furthermore, using the proposed fin model, we demonstrate hovering experimental results with the robot U-CAT. The results demonstrate the possibility to control fin-actuated vehicles using the proposed model to generate the fins oscillation amplitudes as control input. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85116043197&doi=10.1016%2fj.oceaneng.2021.109883&partnerID=40&md5=2bea803b54ec3b06edad58b3e8cc0958,Ocean Engineering,2021
Intelligent reflecting surface and uav assisted secrecy communication in millimeter-wave networks,"In this paper, we consider the secure transmission problem in an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) and intelligent reflecting surface (IRS) assisted mmWave networks in the presence of an eavesdropper. The UAV base station (UAV-BS) and IRS are deployed to overcome the blockages. Artificial noise (AN) is exploited against the eavesdropper. Aiming to maximize the secrecy rate, we jointly design the positions and beamforming of UAV-BS and IRS, where the positions here represent the deployed position of the UAV-BS and the activation position of the IRS. Meanwhile, the maximum transmits power, minimum height constraint for UAV-BS, and the legitimate receiver minimum rate constraint are required. To obtain the optimal UAV-BS position, the elevation angle-dependent probabilistic LoS air-to-ground channel is exploited in this network. To tackle the formulated non-convex problem, we divide it into two subproblems: (1) design UAV-BS and IRS positions; (2) design UAV-BS and IRS beamforming. Moreover, to reduce the complexity, we propose an ideal beamforming model to find the near-optimal positions of UAV-BS and IRS. Then, semidefinite relaxation (SDR) is utilized to cope with the highly coupled and high-dimensional variable vectors. Finally, we obtain a sub-optimal solution by an efficient and low-complexity alternating optimization algorithm. Numerical results demonstrate the improvement of secrecy rate by jointly designing the positions as well as the significant performance gains achieved by our proposed schemes over benchmark schemes.  © 2021 IEEE.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85114752338&doi=10.1109%2fTVT.2021.3109467&partnerID=40&md5=d6cb02f55e215bd9f0a0956e859c33c4,IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology,2021
Adversarial point cloud perturbations against 3D object detection in autonomous driving systems,"Deep learning models have been demonstrated vulnerable to adversarial attacks even with imperceptible perturbations. As such, the reliability of existing deep neural networks-based autonomous driving systems can suffer. However, deep 3D models have applications in various Cyber-Physical Systems (CPSs) with safety-critical requirements, particularly autonomous driving systems. In this paper, the robustness of deep 3D object detection models under adversarial point cloud perturbations has been investigated. A novel method is developed to generate 3D adversarial examples from point cloud perturbations, which are common due to the intrinsic characteristics of the data captured by 3D sensors, e.g., LiDAR. The generation of adversarial samples is supervised by a dual loss, which constitutes an adversarial loss and a perturbation loss. The adversarial loss produces a point cloud with the property of aggressiveness, while the perturbation loss enforces the produced point cloud subject to visual imperception. We demonstrate that the method can successfully attack 3D object detection models in most cases, and expose their vulnerability to physical-world attacks in the form of point cloud perturbations. We perform a thorough evaluation of popular deep 3D object detectors in an adversarial setting on the KITTI vision benchmark. Experimental results show that current deep 3D object detection models are susceptible to adversarial attacks in the context of autonomous driving, and their performances are degraded by a large margin in the presence of adversarial point clouds generated by the proposed method. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85115915801&doi=10.1016%2fj.neucom.2021.09.027&partnerID=40&md5=e9b0adae45d47a66f4910e9b01d13e32,Neurocomputing,2021
Performance Trade-Off in UAV-Aided Wireless-Powered Communication Networks via Multi-Objective Optimization,"In this paper, we study an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV)-enabled wireless powered communication network, where a UAV serves multiple energy constrained wireless sensor nodes (WSNs). In such a network, a UAV transmits wireless power to a group of WSNs which exploits the harvested power to transfer their own information towards the UAV in the uplink. For practical scenarios, a nonlinear energy harvesting saturation model is considered at WSNs. We aim to design resource allocation which maximizes the achievable sum rate in the uplink and minimizes the downlink transmit power simultaneously. The design is formulated as a multi-objective optimization problem (MOOP) which optimizes the UAV's 3D position, its transmit power, the time splitting ratio, the uplink transmission time and the beamwidth angle of the UAV. The formulated problem is a non-convex problem which is generally intractable. To address the MOOP, a weighted Tchebycheff method is proposed. The numerical results show a trade-off between the minimum power in the downlink and the maximum rate as well as energy efficiency in the uplink.  © 1967-2012 IEEE.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85121913028&doi=10.1109%2fTVT.2021.3122077&partnerID=40&md5=4a962998616d848a8f721e7f44e126ed,IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology,2021
Dependability and Security Quantification of an Internet of Medical Things Infrastructure Based on Cloud-Fog-Edge Continuum for Healthcare Monitoring Using Hierarchical Models,"Rising aggressive virus pandemics urge to conduct studies on dependability and security of modern computing systems to secure autonomous and continuous operations of healthcare systems. In that regard, we propose to quantify dependability and security measures of an Internet-of-Medical Things (IoMT) infrastructure relied on an integrated physical architecture of cloud/fog/edge (CFE) computing paradigms in this article. We propose a reliability/availability quantification methodology for the IoMT infrastructure using a hierarchical model of three levels: 1) fault tree (FT) of overall IoMT infrastructure consisting of CFE member systems; 2) FT of subsystems within CFE member systems; and 3) continuous-time Markov chain (CTMC) models of components/devices in the subsystems. We incorporate a number of failure modes for the underlying subsystems, including Mandel-bug related failures and non-Mandel bugs related failure, as well as failures due to cyber-security attacks on software subsystems. Five case-studies of configuration alternation and four operational scenarios of the IoMT infrastructure are considered to comprehend the dependability characteristics of the IoMT physical infrastructure. The metrics of interest include reliability over time, steady state availability (SSA), sensitivity of SSA wrt. selected mean time to failure-equivalent (MTTFeq) and mean time to recovery-equivalent (MTTReq), and sensitivity of SSA wrt. frequencies of cyber-security attacks on software subsystems. The analysis results help comprehend operational behaviors and properties of a typical IoMT infrastructure.

Provably Safe and Scalable Multivehicle Trajectory Planning,"The Hamilton-Jacobi (HJ) reachability is a promising tool for guaranteeing goal satisfaction and safety for multivehicle systems. However, a direct application of HJ reachability in most cases becomes intractable due to its exponentially scaling computational complexity with respect to the number of vehicles. In the work by Chen et al. (2018), the sequential trajectory planning (STP) method was proposed, which allows safe, multiple-vehicle trajectory planning to be done with a computation complexity that scales linearly with the number of vehicles. However, the STP computation is still not tractable for large-scale systems using the currently available tools. In this work, we introduce BEACLS, a C++-based reachability toolbox, that can leverage GPU parallelization to improve the computation speed of HJ reachability by nearly 100 times compared with the existing MATLAB implementations. We then combine BEACLS with STP for the safe, large-scale multiple-unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) planning in a city environment and a multicity environment. We show that intuitive multilane structures naturally emerge, and the size of disturbances and the vehicle density are the primary factors determining the number and width of lanes. We also extend the STP method to safely account for an adversarial intruder during trajectory planning. In the proposed formulation, the number of vehicles that need to replan is a design parameter that can be chosen based on the computational resources available during run time. The proposed formulation along with BEACLS provides both an algorithm and an efficient computational tool for resilient, large-scale multiple-vehicle trajectory planning. © 1993-2012 IEEE.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85099088258&doi=10.1109%2fTCST.2020.3042815&partnerID=40&md5=f3201e847f4b2cbcd4967ac470f915ee,IEEE Transactions on Control Systems Technology,2021
MEdge-Chain: Leveraging Edge Computing and Blockchain for Efficient Medical Data Exchange,"Medical data exchange between diverse e-health entities can lead to a better healthcare quality, improving the response time in emergency conditions, and a more accurate control of critical medical events (e.g., national health threats or epidemics). However, exchanging large amount of information between different e-health entities is challenging in terms of security, privacy, and network loads, especially for large-scale healthcare systems. Indeed, recent solutions suffer from poor scalability, computational cost, and slow response. Thus, this article proposes medical-edge-blockchain (MEdge-Chain), a holistic framework that exploits the integration of edge computing and blockchain-based technologies to process large amounts of medical data. Specifically, the proposed framework describes a healthcare system that aims to aggregate diverse health entities in a unique national healthcare system by enabling swift, secure exchange, and storage of medical data. Moreover, we design an automated patients monitoring scheme, at the edge, which enables the remote monitoring and efficient discovery of critical medical events. Then, we integrate this scheme with a blockchain architecture to optimize medical data exchanging between diverse entities. Furthermore, we develop a blockchain-based optimization model that aims to optimize the latency and computational cost of medical data exchange between different health entities, hence providing effective and secure healthcare services. Finally, we show the effectiveness of our system in adapting to different critical events, while highlighting the benefits of the proposed intelligent health system. © 2014 IEEE.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85099723105&doi=10.1109%2fJIOT.2021.3052910&partnerID=40&md5=6fe3e97e4f14d019a54cb9f7bf8143fe,IEEE Internet of Things Journal,2021
Diversity-Sensitive Generative Adversarial Network for Terrain Mapping under Limited Human Intervention,"In a collaborative air-ground robotic system, the large-scale terrain mapping using aerial images is important for the ground robot to plan a globally optimal path. However, it is a challenging task in a novel and dynamic field without historical human supervision. To alleviate the reliance on human intervention, this article presents a novel framework that integrates active learning and generative adversarial networks (GANs) to effectively exploit small human-labeled data for terrain mapping. In order to model the diverse terrain patterns, this article designs two novel diversity-sensitive GAN models which can capture fine-grained terrain classes among aerial image patches. The proposed approaches are tested in two real-world scenarios using our collaborative air-ground robotic platform. The empirical results show that our methods can outperform their counterparts in the predictive accuracy of terrain classification, visual quality of terrain mapping, and average length of the planned ground path.

Numerical and experimental flight verifications of a calibration matrix approach for load monitoring and temperature reconstruction and compensation,"Mechanical and aeronautical structures could experience unexpected loads during operations, potentially reducing their operability. A load monitoring system enables one to recover the actual load spectra of the component and track its aging continuously. However, complex loading can be difficult to be identified, as for complex aerodynamic loads due to operational maneuvers in aeronautical structures, especially when environmental conditions vary. This work proposes a method for recovering the full strain and displacement fields in the entire structure, leveraging on the Calibration Matrix approach and an equivalent set of lumped forces, including the thermal variation among the unknown parameters. A least-squares minimization of an error functional defined as a comparison between measured and numerical strain is exploited for load and temperature reconstruction, automatically compensating thermal effects on the strain measurements without requiring any training data sets. By assuming a linear relationship between strain and the unknowns through a calibration matrix, the minimization can be performed analytically offline, resulting in a computationally very efficient algorithm that can be operated in real-time at a reduced computational burden. Though the mathematical formulation is general for any arbitrary component geometry and loading condition, the method is tested with a full-scale Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) undergoing different operational maneuvers, both numerically and with actual flight tests. The results confirm the robustness of the method to real environmental disturbances, correctly reconstructing the strain and displacement fields due to aerodynamic loads through triangular equivalent forces and automatically adapting to different load scenarios and temperature changes. © 2021",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85114001927&doi=10.1016%2fj.ast.2021.107074&partnerID=40&md5=bfc098ff67497ef50f7349757a87e43e,Aerospace Science and Technology,2021
Generalizing state-of-the-art object detectors for autonomous vehicles in unseen environments,"In scene understanding for autonomous vehicles (AVs), models trained on the available datasets fail to generalize well to the complex, real-world scenarios with higher dynamics. In this work, we attempt to handle the distribution mismatch by employing the generative adversarial network (GAN) and weather modeling to strengthen the intra-domain data. We also alleviate the fragility of our trained models against natural distortions with state-of-the-art augmentation approaches. Finally, we assess our method for cross-domain object detection through CARLA simulation. Our experiments demonstrate that: (1) Augmenting training class with even limited intra-domain data captured from the adverse weather conditions boosts the generalization of the two kinds of object detectors; (2) Exploiting GANs and weather modeling to elaborately simulate the adverse, intra-domain weather conditions manages to surmount the adverse data scarcity issue for intra-domain object detection; (3) A combination of Augmix and style augmentations not only can promote the robustness of our trained models against different natural distortions but also can boost their performance in the cross-domain object detection; (4) Training GANs for unsupervised image-to-image translation by means of the existing, large-scale datasets outside of our training domain is found beneficial to alleviate image-based and instance-based domain shifts. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85108363569&doi=10.1016%2fj.eswa.2021.115417&partnerID=40&md5=b28dd0936fcb50e4b6e7ffd050d40f55,Expert Systems with Applications,2021
Blockchain-Based Key Management for Heterogeneous Flying Ad Hoc Network,"Unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) is recognized as one of the best sensing tools for gathering data in the industrial Internet of things sector. Besides, the flying ad hoc network (FANET) with multiple drones shows significant advantages in complicated task performing of large area. However, as an important part of communication security, key management for FANET currently depends heavily on the base station or infrastructures, which may easily become the attack target or increase the communication overheads of drones. Therefore, we propose a blockchain-based distributed key management scheme for heterogeneous FANET in this article, based on which drones can autonomously distribute cluster keys, update their public/private key pairs, migrate between clusters, and revoke malicious UAVs in a secure way. Security analysis and performance evaluation prove that our scheme can resist against a variety of external and internal attacks, and guarantee lightweight energy consumption for ordinary drones in the network.  © 2005-2012 IEEE.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85099096499&doi=10.1109%2fTII.2020.3048398&partnerID=40&md5=4fa8b36b37f6da6f8160a184b9f96ae8,IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics,2021
Hybrid FWPS cooperation algorithm based unmanned aerial vehicle constrained path planning,"This paper considers the unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) global path planning as an optimization problem with multiple constraints and proposes an improved fireworks algorithm (FWA) and particle swarm optimization (PSO) cooperation algorithm to generate an optimal path. The objective function of the UAV flight path is modeled to have the shortest length satisfying strict multiple threat area constraints. The α constrained method using the level comparison strategy is integrated into both FWA and PSO to enhance their superior constraint-handling ability. To increase the population diversity, the whole population is divided to fireworks and particles, which perform search operation in parallel. A new mutation strategy in the fireworks is adopted to avoid falling into the local optimum. Information sharing mechanism between fireworks and particles is established to make the population achieve the excellent global optimization performance. Several numerical simulations are carried out and the results show that our proposed algorithm performs well in obtaining high quality solutions and handling constraints. © 2021 Elsevier Masson SAS",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85112841188&doi=10.1016%2fj.ast.2021.107004&partnerID=40&md5=c97c7b5b1112f326f34c9c738ac4b223,Aerospace Science and Technology,2021
Interdependence-Aware Game-Theoretic Framework for Secure Intelligent Transportation Systems,"The operation of future intelligent transportation systems (ITSs), communications infrastructure (CI), and power grids (PGs) will be highly interdependent. In particular, autonomous connected vehicles require CI resources to operate, and, thus, communication failures can result in nonoptimality in the ITS flow in terms of traffic jams and fuel consumption. Similarly, CI components, e.g., base stations (BSs) can be impacted by failures in the electric grid that is powering them. Thus, malicious attacks on the PG can lead to failures in both the CI and the ITSs. To this end, in this article, the security of an ITS against indirect attacks carried out through the PG is studied in an interdependent PG-CI-ITS scenario. In the considered scenario, an attacker can induce nonoptimality in the ITS or disrupt a particular set of streets by attacking the PG components while remaining stealthy from the ITS administrators. To defend against such attacks, the administrator of the interdependent critical infrastructure can allocate backup power sources (BPSs) at every BS to compensate for the power loss caused by the attacker. However, due to budget limitations, the administrator must consider the importance of each BS in light of the PG risk of failure, while allocating the BPSs. In this regard, a rigorous analytical framework is proposed to model the interdependencies between the ITS, CI, and PG. Next, a one-to-one relationship between the PG components and ITS streets is derived in order to capture the effect of the PG components' failure on the optimality of the traffic flow in the streets. Moreover, the problem of BPS allocation is formulated using a Stackelberg game framework and the Stackelberg equilibrium (SE) of the game is characterized. Simulation results show that the derived SE outperforms any other BPS allocation strategy and can be scalable in linear time with respect to the size of the interdependent infrastructure. © 2014 IEEE.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85118897226&doi=10.1109%2fJIOT.2020.3020899&partnerID=40&md5=fe6b9cced2cbe121cbe55c85d55c26b2,IEEE Internet of Things Journal,2021
Bioinspired Bearing only Motion Camouflage UAV Guidance for Covert Video Surveillance of a Moving Target,The paper focuses on video monitoring of a moving ground target using an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV). The aim is to navigate the UAV so that it is able to monitor the target while concealing its apparent motion in respect to the target's visual system. A computationally simple sliding mode closed-loop control algorithm mimicking motion camouflage stealth behavior observed in some attacking animals is developed. The proposed guidance law is based on bearing only measurements and does not require any information on the targets' velocity and the distance to the target. Simulations are conducted to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method. © 2007-2012 IEEE.,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85121693002&doi=10.1109%2fJSYST.2020.3028577&partnerID=40&md5=80caa586adabf5ff62206c5dac14ba8a,IEEE Systems Journal,2021
Testbed Scenario Design Exploiting Traffic Big Data for Autonomous Ship Trials under Multiple Conflicts with Collision/Grounding Risks and Spatiooral Dependencies,"Autonomous ships are promoted as the future of the maritime transport industry aiming to overcome conventional vessels in terms of performance, safety and environmental impact. Yet their tangled cyber-physical-social interactions and new emerging properties induce questions regarding their liability and trustworthiness. Digital simulations and sea trials are launched to assure the safety requirements and social expectations are met a priori. This paper presents the design of realistic testbed scenarios from huge historical data through a high-performance computational method to recommend a complete set of navigation scenarios for autonomy tests. The developed approach integrates traffic big data from Automatic Identification System (AIS) with high-resolution digital maps, vessel information registry, and digital nautical charts. All historical vessel-to-ground and vessel-to-vessel interactions are efficiently analyzed through a hierarchical method for collision and grounding conflicts assessment with a 15-minutes prediction horizon. Relative risk is evaluated accurately over full periods of predicted close-quarters situations subject to physical limits and sea-room availability for evasive maneuverers under COLREG rules and traffic separation schemes. Spatial dependencies among multiple conflicts define risky momentary traffic situations modelled through directed graph representation of nested interactions. Their temporal dependencies describe navigation scenarios through dynamic co-behaviors between multiple participating vessels over a period of time. Finally, we analyze negative/positive actions that increase/decrease the complexity. The presented algorithms are computationally very efficient, they scale to several (country∗year)s where millions of scenarios are extracted, classified, and scored by their relative risk, complexity, and likelihood for firm post-test conclusions.  © 2000-2011 IEEE.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85110893077&doi=10.1109%2fTITS.2021.3095547&partnerID=40&md5=d17c74bb32323ed19e6e9e80e0a99bbe,IEEE Transactions on Intelligent Transportation Systems,2021
Deep Learning-Based Autonomous Driving Systems: A Survey of Attacks and Defenses,"The rapid development of artificial intelligence, especially deep learning technology, has advanced autonomous driving systems (ADSs) by providing precise control decisions to counterpart almost any driving event, spanning from antifatigue safe driving to intelligent route planning. However, ADSs are still plagued by increasing threats from different attacks, which could be categorized into physical attacks, cyberattacks and learning-based adversarial attacks. Inevitably, the safety and security of deep learning-based autonomous driving are severely challenged by these attacks, from which the countermeasures should be analyzed and studied comprehensively to mitigate all potential risks. This survey provides a thorough analysis of different attacks that may jeopardize ADSs, as well as the corresponding state-of-the-art defense mechanisms. The analysis is unrolled by taking an in-depth overview of each step in the ADS workflow, covering adversarial attacks for various deep learning models and attacks in both physical and cyber context. Furthermore, some promising research directions are suggested in order to improve deep learning-based autonomous driving safety, including model robustness training, model testing and verification, and anomaly detection based on cloud/edge servers. © 2021 IEEE Computer Society.

DynaNet: Neural Kalman Dynamical Model for Motion Estimation and Prediction,"Dynamical models estimate and predict the temporal evolution of physical systems. State-space models (SSMs) in particular represent the system dynamics with many desirable properties, such as being able to model uncertainty in both the model and measurements, and optimal (in the Bayesian sense) recursive formulations, e.g., the Kalman filter. However, they require significant domain knowledge to derive the parametric form and considerable hand tuning to correctly set all the parameters. Data-driven techniques, e.g., recurrent neural networks, have emerged as compelling alternatives to SSMs with wide success across a number of challenging tasks, in part due to their impressive capability to extract relevant features from rich inputs. They, however, lack interpretability and robustness to unseen conditions. Thus, data-driven models are hard to be applied in safety-critical applications, such as self-driving vehicles. In this work, we present DynaNet, a hybrid deep learning and time-varying SSM, which can be trained end-to-end. Our neural Kalman dynamical model allows us to exploit the relative merits of both SSM and deep neural networks. We demonstrate its effectiveness in the estimation and prediction on a number of physically challenging tasks, including visual odometry, sensor fusion for visual-inertial navigation, and motion prediction. In addition, we show how DynaNet can indicate failures through investigation of properties, such as the rate of innovation (Kalman gain).  © 2012 IEEE.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85115726035&doi=10.1109%2fTNNLS.2021.3112460&partnerID=40&md5=81b1cf662f1af8d9e19d009573044265,IEEE Transactions on Neural Networks and Learning Systems,2021
Path Tracking Control of Autonomous Vehicles Subject to Deception Attacks via a Learning-Based Event-Triggered Mechanism,"This article investigates the problem of event-triggered secure path tracking control of autonomous ground vehicles (AGVs) under deception attacks. To relieve the burden of the shareable vehicle communication network and to improve the tracking performance in the presence of deception attacks, a learning-based event-triggered mechanism (ETM) is proposed. Different from existing ETMs, the triggering threshold of the proposed mechanism can be dynamically adjusted with conditions of the latest vehicle state. Each vehicle in this study is deemed as an agent, under which a novel control strategy is developed for these autonomous agents with deception attacks. With the assistance of Lyapunov stability theory, sufficient conditions are obtained to guarantee the stability and stabilization of the overall system. Finally, a simulation example is provided to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed theoretical results.  © 2012 IEEE.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85100937082&doi=10.1109%2fTNNLS.2021.3056764&partnerID=40&md5=f9861cb79c408b61f833910d8326876f,IEEE Transactions on Neural Networks and Learning Systems,2021
Adaptive Resilient Event-Triggered Control Design of Autonomous Vehicles with an Iterative Single Critic Learning Framework,"This article investigates the adaptive resilient event-triggered control for rear-wheel-drive autonomous (RWDA) vehicles based on an iterative single critic learning framework, which can effectively balance the frequency/changes in adjusting the vehicle's control during the running process. According to the kinematic equation of RWDA vehicles and the desired trajectory, the tracking error system during the autonomous driving process is first built, where the denial-of-service (DoS) attacking signals are injected into the networked communication and transmission. Combining the event-triggered sampling mechanism and iterative single critic learning framework, a new event-triggered condition is developed for the adaptive resilient control algorithm, and the novel utility function design is considered for driving the autonomous vehicle, where the control input can be guaranteed into an applicable saturated bound. Finally, we apply the new adaptive resilient control scheme to a case of driving the RWDA vehicles, and the simulation results illustrate the effectiveness and practicality successfully.  © 2012 IEEE.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85100711829&doi=10.1109%2fTNNLS.2021.3053269&partnerID=40&md5=f36bc501e5e0250e8b4ecf6a9b31dd8c,IEEE Transactions on Neural Networks and Learning Systems,2021
The outage-free replacement problem in unmanned aerial vehicle base stations,"Thanks to the feature of on-demand and flexible deployment, unmanned aerial vehicle base stations (UAV-BS) can enhance coverage and capacity beyond current 5 G cellular networks. The main challenge in deploying UAV-BS lies in the fact that the limited battery in UAB-BS cannot support long-time reliable services. Therefore, a serving UAV-BS being running out its power needs to be replaced with a new fully-charged UAV-BS. This is called UAV-BS replacement process. However, most existing UAV-BS replacement methods ignore the link outage problem during the replacement. Thus the outage-free replacement problem (OFRP) for UAV-BSs arises. We provide a method to calculate the outage probability of the UAV replacement approach. We further formulate the Outage Probability Minimization Problem (OPMP) for UAV-BS replacement. To solve this problem, a 3-Dimensional Outage-Free Replacement Approach (3D-OFRA) is presented, which exploits different heights of swapping UAV-BSs during the replacement process. More importantly, we provide the guidelines of determining the distance between two UAV-BSs to minimize the link outage possibility during the UAV-BS replacement process. Our numerical results show that with the recommended distance between two UAV-BSs based on 3D-OFRA, the outage probability of the served UEs approaches to zero, compared with 40% of the traditional direct replacement approach. © 2021 Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc..

CANMatch: A Fully Automated Tool for CAN Bus Reverse Engineering Based on Frame Matching,"Controller Area Network is the most frequently used in-vehicle communication system in the automotive industry today. The communication inside the Controller Area Network (CAN) bus is typically encoded using proprietary formats in order to prevent easy access to the information exchanged on the bus. However, it is still possible to decode this information through reverse engineering, performed either manually or via automated tools. Existing automated CAN bus reverse engineering methods are still time-consuming and require some manual effort, i.e., to inject diagnostic messages in order to trigger specific responses. In this paper, we propose CANMatch-a fully automated CAN bus reverse engineering framework that does not require any manual effort and significantly decreases the execution time by exploiting the reuse of CAN frames across different vehicle models. We evaluate the proposed solution on a dataset of CAN logs, or traces, related to 479 vehicles from 29 different automotive manufacturers, demonstrating its improved performance with respect to the state of the art. © 1967-2012 IEEE.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85118626000&doi=10.1109%2fTVT.2021.3124550&partnerID=40&md5=52079053da08df7857920728822361a5,IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology,2021
"Visual-based obstacle detection and tracking, and conflict detection for small UAS sense and avoid","This paper proposes an original approach for visual-based obstacle detection and tracking, and conflict detection, suitable to endow small Unmanned Aircraft Systems with non-cooperative Sense and Avoid capabilities. Specifically, it is designed to detect and track an uncooperative flying object (intruder), and to establish whether or not it represents a collision threat. It is based on three main algorithmic steps, each aided by the use of ownship navigation data. First, visual detection is carried out using two Deep Learning based neural networks (operating above and below the horizon, respectively) followed by local image analysis to improve the accuracy in the detected intruder position on the image plane. Second, tentative track generation and firm tracking are executed exploiting local association, multi-temporal frame differencing, and Kalman filtering. Finally, conflict detection is applied to each firm track based on the estimate of line of sight and line of sight rate in stabilized coordinates. An experimental dataset, which reproduces realistic low-altitude encounter geometries with two customized quadcopters, is collected to assess proposed approach performance. The two vehicles, equipped with high-resolution color cameras, are flown at slightly different altitudes so that the intruder is located above and below the horizon in the two respective image subsets. The proposed approach allows the target to be declared at relatively long range and to be tracked with a line of sight rate accuracy of the order of tenths of degrees per second, which is effective for conflict detection. © 2021 The Author(s)",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85118746339&doi=10.1016%2fj.ast.2021.107167&partnerID=40&md5=d81a775b5a79d9fea6b6f62803b7dd3e,Aerospace Science and Technology,2021
Autonomous Source Search for UAVs Using Gaussian Mixture Model-Based Infotaxis: Algorithm and Flight Experiments,"Estimating and searching source information such as the location and release rate, called a source term, have many applications across environmental, medical, and security domains. The Bayesian inference framework is used to estimate the source term. Since the gas dispersion and its measurements in a turbulent environment are highly non-Gaussian and nonlinear, the particle filter, one of sequential Monte Carlo methods, is adopted in this article. For autonomous source term search in a turbulent environment, this article presents an information-theoretic search approach that combines a widely used Infotaxis approach with the Gaussian mixture model (GMM), termed as GMM-Infotaxis. The GMM is used to determine action candidates for the next best informative sampling position in a continuous domain by appropriately clustering possible source locations obtained from the particle filter. This facilitates a better trade-off between exploitation and exploration for autonomous source search. Through the outdoor experiments, on average, the estimation errors for localization and release rate of the source are reduced 74 and 73%, respectively, while the search time step of the mobile agent is decreased around 18%. Real outdoor flight experiments using a multirotor UAV in various experimental setups show the superior performance of the proposed approach compared with the original Infotaxis method. © 1965-2011 IEEE.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85111047097&doi=10.1109%2fTAES.2021.3098132&partnerID=40&md5=efd029ee447f8d7bb1688fa2407e33c7,IEEE Transactions on Aerospace and Electronic Systems,2021
An enhanced UAV safety control scheme against attacks on desired trajectory,"The detection and compensation of attacks are crucial for UAV safety. This paper focuses on the case where the desired trajectory sent by ground control station (GCS) is attacked. Based on the analysis of the attack transmission mechanism, an integrated scheme of attack detection and compensation is presented. The attack detection mechanism is established based on the trajectory tracking error and state estimation error. In addition, the proposed scheme can not only detect attacks but also distinguish attacks from unknown abrupt disturbances. In the proposed scheme, attack observer (AO) and learning observer (LO) are developed to address the coupling problem of additive and multiplicative attacks. Finally, the effectiveness of the proposed scheme is validated by both simulation and experimental tests. © 2021 Elsevier Masson SAS",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85119434807&doi=10.1016%2fj.ast.2021.107212&partnerID=40&md5=8927aa8089527960c95555932ab50543,Aerospace Science and Technology,2021
Improved contract network protocol algorithm based cooperative target allocation of heterogeneous UAV swarm,"For the target attack mission of Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) swarm, the heterogeneous and large-scale characters usually bring about the uneven allocation problem. In the present work, an improved contract network protocol (CNP) based cooperative target allocation scheme is proposed to deal with heterogeneous overloading and time sequences problem. Firstly, the cooperative target allocation model aimed at heterogeneous UAVs and targets is established, including the total flight distance, flight time, target survival rate and load rate. Secondly, situation-based advantage value is calculated as the winning criterion to assign the UAV.

Connected and automated vehicle distributed control for on-ramp merging scenario: A virtual rotation approach,"This study proposes a rotation-based connected automated vehicle (CAV) distributed cooperative control strategy for an on-ramp merging scenario. By assuming the mainline and ramp line are straight, we firstly design a virtual rotation approach that transfers the merging problem to a virtual car following (CF) problem to reduce the complexity and dimension of the cooperative CAVs merging control. Based on this concept, a multiple-predecessor virtual CF model and a unidirectional multi-leader communication topology are developed to determine the longitudinal behavior of each CAV. Specifically, we exploit a distributed feedback and feedforward longitudinal controller in preparation for actively generating gaps for merging CAVs, reducing the voids caused by merging, and ensuring safety and traffic efficiency during the process. To ensure the disturbance attenuation property of this system, practical string stability is mathematically proved for the virtual CF controllers to prohibit the traffic oscillation amplification through the traffic stream. Moreover, as a provision for extending the virtual CF application scenarios of any curvy ramp geometry, we utilize a curvilinear coordinate to model the two-dimensional merging control, and further design a local lateral controller based on an extended linear-quadratic regulator to regulate the position deviation and angular deviation of the lane centerlines. For the purpose of systematically evaluating the control performance of the proposed methods, numerical simulation experiments are conducted. As the results indicate, the proposed controllers can actively reduce the void and meanwhile guarantee the damping of traffic oscillations in the merging control area. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85119612031&doi=10.1016%2fj.trc.2021.103451&partnerID=40&md5=131b27a7dbb475a9cb65df446aebf45f,Transportation Research Part C: Emerging Technologies,2021
Robust Resource Allocation Algorithm for Energy-Harvesting-Based D2D Communication Underlaying UAV-Assisted Networks,"Energy efficiency (EE) is a significant performance indicator in unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV)-assisted communication networks for providing a balance between power consumption minimization and transmission rate maximization. However, most of the current works focus on the transmission rate maximization under perfect channel state information (CSI) and exact coordinate information, which is too ideal in practical systems due to channel estimation errors and coordinate estimation errors. Thus, robust resource allocation algorithms with imperfect CSI and coordinate information are critically important to reduce users' outages and improve system robustness. In this article, a robust EE maximization problem with channel uncertainties and coordinate uncertainties is formulated for an energy harvesting-based device-to-device (D2D) communication underlaying UAV-assisted network under some necessary constraints, which involve the outage probability constraints of ground terminals, the flight altitude constraint of the UAV, the minimum harvested energy constraints of D2D users, and the transmission time constraint. Both radio resource allocation and the flight altitude are jointly optimized based on the worst case approach. The considered nonconvex problem is transformed into a convex one by exploiting variable relaxation and variable substitution approaches. The Lagrange dual theory is used to derive the closed-form expressions of robust resource allocation. Simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm by comparing it with the benchmark algorithms in terms of EE and robustness. © 2014 IEEE.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85105882944&doi=10.1109%2fJIOT.2021.3078264&partnerID=40&md5=e6aaa17b3aeb5f372fe6152c5dd0ce29,IEEE Internet of Things Journal,2021
Dispatch of UAVs for urban vehicular networks: A deep reinforcement learning approach,"Due to the dynamic nature of connectivity in terrestrial vehicular networks, it is of great benefit to deploy unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) in these networks to act as relays. As a result, a remarkable number of studies have exploited UAVs to bridge the communication gaps between terrestrial vehicles, and sometimes despite their unoptimized mobility, their restricted communication coverage, and their limited energy resources. However, it was noted that for an intermittently connected vehicular network, UAVs could not cover all sparse areas all the time. Even worse, when deploying enough UAVs to cover all these areas, the probability of inter-UAV collisions increases, and it will be complex to control their movements efficiently. Consequently, it is required to dispatch an organized and intelligent group of UAVs to perform communication relays in the long term while keeping their connectivity, minimizing their average energy consumption, and providing an efficient coverage strategy. To meet these requirements, we propose a deep reinforcement learning (DRL) framework, called DISCOUNT (Dispatch of UAVs for Urban VANETs). Extensive simulations have been conducted to evaluate the performance of the proposed framework. It has been shown that the proposed framework significantly outperforms two commonly-used baseline techniques and some reinforcement learning methods in terms of energy consumption, coverage, and routing performances. © 2021 Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc..

Toward Trusted and Secure Communication among Multiple Internal Modules in CAV,"By equipping various sensors and analyzing sensed data, vehicles can perform automatic driving; these vehicles are known as connected and autonomous vehicles (CAVs). In CAVs, tampered data will result in incorrect driving decisions. Hence, secure data transmission should be ensured to enable correct life-critical decisions. Untrusted resource-constrained modules allow attackers to obtain private data from CAVs, such as the key. Benefitting from trusted computing, the proposed scheme can verify the trusted status of internal modules and achieve secure data transmission by adopting the remote attestation and hash message authentication code. The scheme is proven to be secure in the random oracle model under the computational Diffie-Hellman problem. Furthermore, we perform experiments and evaluate the performance using Intel Software Guard eXtensions, which provide part of the trusted computing function.

A diversified group teaching optimization algorithm with segment-based fitness strategy for unmanned aerial vehicle route planning,"The complexity and diversity of the flight environment pose great challenges to unmanned aerial vehicle route planning, which demands feasible flight strategies and efficient route planning algorithms. To address the issue, this paper constructs a 3-D flight environment model with multiple obstacles, and designs a novel diversified group teaching optimization algorithm for the generation of flight routes of unmanned aerial vehicles. In the environment model, a variety of obstacles are taken into consideration to make the flying scenarios more realistic, including mountain, cuboid, cylinder and triangular prism, and corresponding strategies are presented for unmanned aerial vehicles to safely avoid these obstacles. In the proposed algorithm, three novel teaching methods are introduced to balance the exploitation and exploration phases. Besides, a novel constrained optimization strategy is adopted, in which constraints are incrementally added to the fitness function to avoid the premature phenomenon in the initial iteration stage of algorithm. The experimental results show that compared with several state-of-the-art optimization algorithms, the proposed algorithm is significantly superior and can always generate the optimal flight route in complicated environments. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85112362975&doi=10.1016%2fj.eswa.2021.115690&partnerID=40&md5=b125d845154bd67b1387066d9e852045,Expert Systems with Applications,2021
Probabilistic Adaptive Spatial-Temporal Regularized Correlation Filters for UAV Tracking,"Most existing trackers based on spatial-temporal regularized correlation filters exploit response map variation to adapt regularization terms to object appearance changes automatically. However, these trackers ignore the high uncertainty of the response map when the object is occluded or similar objects around, making them unable to learn reliable filters accurately. Furthermore, most correlation filters use linear interpolation directly to update the filter model at each frame, which may cause model degradation once the tracking result is inaccurate or missing. In this work, we propose a novel probabilistic adaptive spatial-temporal regularized correlation filters (PASTRCF) to solve the two issues mentioned above. A probabilistic model constructing the reliability of the response map is introduced to accurately utilize the information in the response map to learn regularization coefficients adaptively. The adaptive threshold mechanism provides an appropriate strategy to update the filter model to alleviate model degradation. Extensive experiments on UAV benchmarks have proven the favorable performance of our method compared to the state-of-art trackers, with robust tracking while ensuring real-time performance. © 2022 R.

Learning Disentangled Representation in Pruning for Real-Time UAV Tracking,"Efficiency is a critical issue in UAV tracking because of the limitations of computing resources, battery capacity, and maximum load of unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV). However, deep learning (DL)-based trackers hardly achieve real-time tracking on a single CPU despite their high tracking precision. To the contrary, discriminative correlation filters (DCF)based trackers have high efficiency but their precision is barely satisfactory. Despite the precision is inferior, DCF-based trackers instead of DL-based ones are widely applied in UAV tracking to trade precision for efficiency. This paper aims to improve the efficiency of the DL-based tracker SiamFC++, in particular, for UAV tracking using the model compression technique, i.e., rank-based filter pruning, which has not been well explored before. Meanwhile, to combat the potential loss of precision caused by pruning we exploit disentangled representation learning to disentangle the output feature of the backbone into two parts: the identity-related features and the identity-unrelated features. Only the identity-related features are used for subsequent classification and regression tasks to improve the effectiveness of the feature representation. With the proposed disentangled representation in pruning, we achieved higher precisions when compressing the original model SiamFC++ with a global pruning ratio of 0.5. Extensive experiments on four public UAV benchmarks, i.e., UAV123@10fps, UAVDT, DTB70, and Vistrone2018, show that the proposed tracker DP-SiamFC++ strikes a remarkable balance between efficiency and precision, and achieves state-of-the-art performance in UAV tracking. © 2022 S.

TPC: Transformation-Specific Smoothing for Point Cloud Models,"Point cloud models with neural network architectures have achieved great success and have been widely used in safety-critical applications, such as Lidar-based recognition systems in autonomous vehicles. However, such models are shown to be vulnerable to adversarial attacks that aim to apply stealthy semantic transformations such as rotation and tapering to mislead model predictions. In this paper, we propose a transformation-specific smoothing framework TPC, which provides tight and scalable robustness guarantees for point cloud models against semantic transformation attacks. We first categorize common 3D transformations into three categories: additive (e.g., shearing), composable (e.g., rotation), and indirectly composable (e.g., tapering), and we present generic robustness certification strategies for all categories respectively. We then specify unique certification protocols for a range of specific semantic transformations and their compositions. Extensive experiments on several common 3D transformations show that TPC significantly outperforms state of the art. For example, our framework boosts the certified accuracy against twisting transformation along the z-axis (within ±20◦) from 20.3% to 83.8%.

Addressing Optimism Bias in Sequence Modeling for Reinforcement Learning,"Impressive results in natural language processing (NLP) based on the Transformer neural network architecture have inspired researchers to explore viewing offline reinforcement learning (RL) as a generic sequence modeling problem. Recent works based on this paradigm have achieved state-of-the-art results in several of the mostly deterministic offline Atari and D4RL benchmarks. However, because these methods jointly model the states and actions as a single sequencing problem, they struggle to disentangle the effects of the policy and world dynamics on the return. Thus, in adversarial or stochastic environments, these methods lead to overly optimistic behavior that can be dangerous in safety-critical systems like autonomous driving. In this work, we propose a method that addresses this optimism bias by explicitly disentangling the policy and world models, which allows us at test time to search for policies that are robust to multiple possible futures in the environment. We demonstrate our method's superior performance on a variety of autonomous driving tasks in simulation.

EMIXER: End-to-end Multimodal X-ray Generation via Self-supervision,"Deep generative models have enabled the automated synthesis of high-quality data for diverse applications. However, the most effective generative models are specialized in data from a single domain (e.g., images or text). Real-world applications such as healthcare require multimodal data from multiple domains (e.g., both images and corresponding text), which are challenging to acquire due to limited availability and privacy concerns and are much harder to synthesize. To tackle this joint synthesis challenge, we propose an End-to-end MultImodal X-ray genERative model (EMIXER) for jointly synthesizing x-ray images and corresponding free-text reports, all conditional on diagnosis labels. EMIXER is a conditional generative adversarial model by 1) generating an image based on a label, 2) encoding the image to a hidden embedding, 3) producing the corresponding text via a hierarchical decoder from the image embedding, and 4) a joint discriminator for assessing both the image and the corresponding text. EMIXER also enables self-supervision to leverage a vast amount of unlabeled data. Extensive experiments with real X-ray reports data illustrate how data augmentation using synthesized multimodal samples can improve the performance of various supervised tasks, including COVID-19 X-ray classification with limited samples. Radiologists also confirm the quality of generated images and reports. We quantitatively show that EMIXER generated synthetic datasets can augment X-ray image classification, and report generation models to achieve 5.94% and 6.9% improvement on models trained only on real data samples. Overall, our results highlight the promise of generative models to overcome challenges in machine learning in healthcare. © 2022 S. Biswal, P.Z., A.P., N. Siddiqui, S. Koyejo & J.

Autonomous Myocardial Infarction Detection from Electrocardiogram with a Multi Label Classification Approach,"Myocardial Infarctions (MI) or heart attacks are among the most common medical emergencies globally. Such an episode often has mild or varied symptoms, making it hard to diagnose and respond in a timely manner. An electrocardiogram (ECG) is used to analyze the heart’s electrical activity and, through this help, clinicians detect and localize a heart attack. However, interpretation of the ECG is made manually by trained professionals. In order to make this diagnosis more efficient, multiple methods have tried to automate the MI detection and localization process. In this work, we aim to create a more effective method of MI detection by restructuring the localization as a multi-label classification (MLC) problem, in which one set of attributes can belong to one or more classes. For this classification, features like the ST-deviation, T wave amplitude, and R-S ratios have been extracted and fed into the MLC model, which in our case, is a chain classifier of random forest. This proposed model will have five classes as the target, which represent the locations where an MI can occur. Our method achieves the best overall hamming accuracy of 81.49% in a k-fold cross validation test, with the highest accuracy for an individual class being 97.72% for anterior. © 2022 V.M. Singh, V.

Robust Traffic Sign Recognition Against Camera Failures,"Failures of the vehicle camera may compromise the correct acquisition of frames, that are subsequently used by autonomous driving tasks. A clear understanding of the behavior of the autonomous driving tasks under such failure conditions, together with strategies to avoid safety is jeopardized, are indeed necessary. This study analyses and improve the performance of Traffic Sign Recognition (TSR) systems for road vehicles under the possible occurrence of camera failures. Our experimental assessment relies on three public datasets, which are commonly used for benchmarking TSR systems. We artificially inject 13 different types of camera failures into the three datasets. Then, we exploit three deep neural networks (DNNs) to classify either a single frame of a traffic sign or a sequence (i.e., a sliding window) of frames. We show that sliding windows significantly improves the robustness of the classifier against altered frames. We confirm our observations through explainable AI, which allows understanding why different classifiers have different performance in case of camera failures.  © 2020 IEEE.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85147393901&doi=10.1109%2fOJITS.2022.3213183&partnerID=40&md5=6e64809cffd9e89857ec62f69ae26085,IEEE Open Journal of Intelligent Transportation Systems,2022
An Improvement of 3D DR/INS/GNSS Integrated System using Inequality Constrained EKF,"It is well known that INS/GNSS integrated system is either unavailable or unreliable in high-rise buildings environment. This study proposes a novel framework to fuse Odometer, INS, and GNSS to provide robust pose estimation for the mentioned challenge. Motivated by the disadvantage of the recent development of 3DDR/GNSS, we relax its assumption where velocities and accelerometer biases are estimated without sensor pre-calibration. In particular, the traditional INS/GNSS and DR/GNSS are augmented into a single system without conflict to perform EKF. Moreover, inequalities-constrained EKF is derived based on the characteristic of the presented system to increase the robustness. This constraint exploits an empirical observable where the position estimation of the odometer is considered more accurate than INS since it only requires one-step integration. The proposed approach is validated through an author-designed Unreal Engine challenging map with the AirSim plugin of an autonomous ground vehicle. The results show a significant accuracy improvement in which the position and velocity error have been reduced respectively 68% and 39% on average over a 0.81km driving.  © 2022 ICROS.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85146561068&doi=10.23919%2fICCAS55662.2022.10003721&partnerID=40&md5=84b8e878901a1ead648fdb8d925cf32f,"International Conference on Control, Automation and Systems",2022
Generation Method of Autonomous Evasive Maneuver Strategy in Air Combat,"Air combat is usually a continuous process involving multiple rounds of missile attacks, UCAV(Unmanned Combat Aerial Vehicle) should consider the impact of maneuver on the entire air combat countermeasure mission rather than solely focusing on safety factors when evading incoming air to air missiles. In this paper, a method of generating autonomous evasive maneuver strategy in UCAV air combat is proposed under the condition of miss distance and energy dissipation. Firstly, the UCAV-missile three-dimensional space pursuit model and the UCAV autonomous evading state space, action space and reward function model are established. Dueling DDQN (Double Deep Q Network) algorithm is used to solve the model, which integrates Double DQN and Dueling DQN Network model. Simulation experiments and analysis show that the method proposed in this paper has significant effectiveness in solving the problem of autonomous evasive maneuvers in air combat under the conditions of miss distance and energy dissipation tactical requirements. The evasive maneuvers strategy obtained can reflect the two tactical requirements of air combat while ensuring the safety of UCAV itself.  © 2022 ICROS.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85146610504&doi=10.23919%2fICCAS55662.2022.10003888&partnerID=40&md5=507854b6e80476a9894cee11cab90ff9,"International Conference on Control, Automation and Systems",2022
A Multi-Drone System for Oil Spill Detection: A Simulation and Emulation Platform,"This paper presents a model for a multi-drone system used for detecting oil spills in seawater. The system is designed to provide an early warning for oil-derivative contamination that may threaten maritime life forms. The system hosts a lightweight machine vision algorithm for detecting oil spills and generating a path for the drones to follow. Also, the system incorporates robust communication; allowing the drones to collaborate as they track the generated path. To achieve autonomous tracking for drones, a robust control scheme is proposed. Specifically, the drone's dynamics model is decomposed into two subsystems in terms of time scale transformation; leading to inner and outer loop dynamics. A combination of nonlinear integral sliding surface and backstepping procedure is employed to produce appropriate thrust and torque forces, which guarantees robust tracking performances of the drones. The proposed system was verified both in simulation as well as in an indoor multi-drone verification environment. The results attest to the efficacy of the developed model.  © 2022 ICROS.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85146607574&doi=10.23919%2fICCAS55662.2022.10003840&partnerID=40&md5=74ea907022ff990dd10ec33ba8dc9a26,"International Conference on Control, Automation and Systems",2022
Autonomous Vehicles on the Edge: A Survey on Autonomous Vehicle Racing,"The rising popularity of self-driving cars has led to the emergence of a new research field in recent years: Autonomous racing. Researchers are developing software and hardware for high-performance race vehicles which aim to operate autonomously on the edge of the vehicle's limits: High speeds, high accelerations, low reaction times, highly uncertain, dynamic, and adversarial environments. This paper represents the first holistic survey that covers the research in the field of autonomous racing. We focus on the field of autonomous racecars only and display the algorithms, methods, and approaches used in the areas of perception, planning, control, and end-to-end learning. Further, with an increasing number of autonomous racing competitions, researchers now have access to high-performance platforms to test and evaluate their autonomy algorithms. This survey presents a comprehensive overview of the current autonomous racing platforms, emphasizing the software-hardware co-evolution to the current stage. Finally, based on additional discussion with leading researchers in the field, we conclude with a summary of open research challenges that will guide future researchers in this field.  © 2020 IEEE.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85143840660&doi=10.1109%2fOJITS.2022.3181510&partnerID=40&md5=9258f7f0fa8391e75d89ecb6638aeb55,IEEE Open Journal of Intelligent Transportation Systems,2022
Measurement-Based Optimal Stealthy Attacks on Remote State Estimation,"This paper focuses on designing measurement-based optimal stealthy attacks for linear cyber-physical systems (CPSs), where attackers aim to deteriorate the performance of remote state estimation and keep ϵ-stealthy to Kullback-Leibler divergence detector. Instead of constructing a linear attack directly, we consider a more general attack model with an arbitrary distribution to reveal the correlations between attacks and the stealth level ϵ. By solving a convex optimization problem, the mean and variance of optimal attacks on common unprotected systems are obtained. Not limited to zero mean Gaussian attacks, the derived optimal attacks can also obey non-zero mean Gaussian distribution and degenerate to the former in some special cases. For protected systems equipped with encryption procedures, a general criterion for the selection of attacked channels is given. Finally, an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) example is provided to verify the effectiveness of the theoretical results. © 2005-2012 IEEE.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85139417122&doi=10.1109%2fTIFS.2022.3206419&partnerID=40&md5=37e8caeb6ead0e22de9b079de99ed45c,IEEE Transactions on Information Forensics and Security,2022
Demystifying the Adversarial Robustness of Random Transformation Defenses,"Neural networks' lack of robustness against attacks raises concerns in security-sensitive settings such as autonomous vehicles. While many countermeasures may look promising, only a few withstand rigorous evaluation. Defenses using random transformations (RT) have shown impressive results, particularly BaRT (Raff et al., 2019) on ImageNet. However, this type of defense has not been rigorously evaluated, leaving its robustness properties poorly understood. Their stochastic properties make evaluation more challenging and render many proposed attacks on deterministic models inapplicable. First, we show that the BPDA attack (Athalye et al., 2018a) used in BaRT's evaluation is ineffective and likely overestimates its robustness. We then attempt to construct the strongest possible RT defense through the informed selection of transformations and Bayesian optimization for tuning their parameters. Furthermore, we create the strongest possible attack to evaluate our RT defense. Our new attack vastly outperforms the baseline, reducing the accuracy by 83% compared to the 19% reduction by the commonly used EoT attack (4.3× improvement). Our result indicates that the RT defense on Imagenette dataset (a ten-class subset of ImageNet) is not robust against adversarial examples. Extending the study further, we use our new attack to adversarially train RT defense (called AdvRT), resulting in a large robustness gain.

Safe Exploration in Wireless Security: A Safe Reinforcement Learning Algorithm With Hierarchical Structure,"Most safe reinforcement learning (RL) algorithms depend on the accurate reward that is rarely available in wireless security applications and suffer from severe performance degradation for the learning agents that have to choose the policy from a large action set. In this paper, we propose a safe RL algorithm, which uses a policy priority-based hierarchical structure to divide each policy into sub-policies with different selection priorities and thus compresses the action set. By applying inter-agent transfer learning to initialize the learning parameters, this algorithm accelerates the initial exploration of the optimal policy. Based on a security criterion that evaluates the risk value, the sub-policy distribution formulation avoids the dangerous sub-policies that cause learning failure such as severe network security problems in wireless security applications, e.g., Internet services interruption. We also propose a deep safe RL and design four deep neural networks in each sub-policy selection to further improve the learning efficiency for the learning agents that support four convolutional neural networks (CNNs): The Q-network evaluates the long-term expected reward of each sub-policy under the current state, and the E-network evaluates the long-term risk value. The target Q and E-networks update the learning parameters of the corresponding CNN to improve the policy exploration stability. As a case study, our proposed safe RL algorithms are implemented in the anti-jamming communication of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) to select the frequency channel and transmit power to the ground node. Experimental results show that our proposed schemes significantly improve the UAV communication performance, save the UAV energy and increase the reward compared with the benchmark against jamming.  © 2005-2012 IEEE.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85124722389&doi=10.1109%2fTIFS.2022.3149396&partnerID=40&md5=228a462dcbae6ecbd0d023cba7d32b30,IEEE Transactions on Information Forensics and Security,2022
Vehicle as a Computational Resource: Optimizing Quality of Experience for connected vehicles in a smart city,"Today, communication technologies enable smart cities to become more effective in terms of satisfactory provision of services. Connected and Autonomous Vehicles (CAVs) can be considered key elements for today's Intelligent Transportation Systems. A small number of research investigations is found to aim at exploiting the resources of CAVs for services provisioning within a smart city. Moreover, and to the best of our knowledge, no research investigations have yet investigated exploiting the computational capabilities of CAVs to become an added value to the computational power of smart cities. In this paper, we introduce the concept of Vehicle as a Computational Resource (VaCR) and develop a system that enables vehicles to share their computational resources within smart cities. Users rely on Service Provider (SP) to acquire the required services that meet their Quality of Experience (QoE) preferences. The device capabilities of VaCR are one of the main indicators in QoE preferences. To that end, evaluation models are developed based on aggregate statistics and Machine Learning (ML) techniques for the discovery and selection of the appropriate VaCRs to participate in the provisioning of services. The deployment is modeled using a multiagent system. Then, game theory is used to model the recruitment that aims at optimizing QoE for Connected Vehicles (CVs). Thorough simulations, analyses, and evaluations of the proposed VaCR system are carried out. The performed validations confirm the effectiveness of the proposed system in optimizing QoE and the successful VaCR system operation, while attaining appealing performance characteristics. © 2021 Elsevier Inc.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85119324761&doi=10.1016%2fj.vehcom.2021.100432&partnerID=40&md5=abb4b115033eadfdd72cdf642bc17a55,Vehicular Communications,2022
Air-to-ground real-time multimedia delivery: A multipath testbed,"In this work, we focus our attention on real-time multimedia flows from Unmanned Aerial Vehicless (UAV) to the ground, presenting and analysing the data collected in field trials during a real testbed. The objective is assessing whether a video feed of reasonable quality can be provided to the pilot of an UAV to enable Beyond Visual Line of Sight (BVLoS) operations, by exploiting the multiple cellular operators available in the area. Three cellular networks have been jointly used in a multihoming/multipath setup, leveraging the variable coverage offered in both urban and suburban environments. Taking into account both Quality of Service (QoS) and Quality of Experience (QoE) metrics, the target parameters measured in this testbed are: latency, packet error rate, and video quality, which accounts for frames integrity, continuity, and fluidity. Data collected on the field allow to evaluate both QoS and QoE in the presence of a multipath architecture, showing how the latter, in the presence of network diversity, offer the possibility to improve the QoE at the receiver. We also design a framework to characterize the error model and to map it into a QoE model, therefore providing an analytical characterisation of a multipath channel. © 2021 Elsevier Inc.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85120867053&doi=10.1016%2fj.vehcom.2021.100443&partnerID=40&md5=dcb4d843ee59e0e35f5d93e57a97c618,Vehicular Communications,2022
Omni: automated ensemble with unexpected models against adversarial evasion attack,"Context: Machine learning-based security detection models have become prevalent in modern malware and intrusion detection systems. However, previous studies show that such models are susceptible to adversarial evasion attacks. In this type of attack, inputs (i.e., adversarial examples) are specially crafted by intelligent malicious adversaries, with the aim of being misclassified by existing state-of-the-art models (e.g., deep neural networks). Once the attackers can fool a classifier to think that a malicious input is actually benign, they can render a machine learning-based malware or intrusion detection system ineffective. Objective: To help security practitioners and researchers build a more robust model against non-adaptive, white-box and non-targeted adversarial evasion attacks through the idea of ensemble model. Method: We propose an approach called Omni, the main idea of which is to explore methods that create an ensemble of “unexpected models”; i.e., models whose control hyperparameters have a large distance to the hyperparameters of an adversary’s target model, with which we then make an optimized weighted ensemble prediction. Results: In studies with five types of adversarial evasion attacks (FGSM, BIM, JSMA, DeepFool and Carlini-Wagner) on five security datasets (NSL-KDD, CIC-IDS-2017, CSE-CIC-IDS2018, CICAndMal2017 and the Contagio PDF dataset), we show Omni is a promising approach as a defense strategy against adversarial attacks when compared with other baseline treatments. Conclusions: When employing ensemble defense against adversarial evasion attacks, we suggest to create ensemble with unexpected models that are distant from the attacker’s expected model (i.e., target model) through methods such as hyperparameter optimization. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85120176543&doi=10.1007%2fs10664-021-10064-8&partnerID=40&md5=03acee33c3a037b523707e2cfa219824,Empirical Software Engineering,2022
Anti-saturation adaptive fault-tolerant control with fixed-time prescribed performance for UAV under AOA asymmetric constraint,"This paper presents an anti-saturation adaptive fault-tolerant control scheme with fixed-time prescribed performance for the longitudinal model of fixed wing UAV under actuator faults, control input saturation, angle of attack (AOA) asymmetric constraint and uncertainties. First, by introducing equivalent error transformation technique, the error transformed models of the altitude and airspeed tracking subsystems are strictly constructed. Second, asymmetric saturation function, auxiliary system and barrier Lyapunov function (BLF) are incorporated to guarantee AOA maintain in the asymmetric constraint. Then, neural network approximation structures are combined with adaptive robust terms to handle the lumped disturbances. Furthermore, Nussbaum-type gain technique is adopted to deal with the unknown time-varying parameter arising from input saturation and actuator faults. According to the stability analysis, the altitude and airspeed tracking errors evolve strictly inside the fixed-time performance envelops, while the AOA remains in asymmetric constraint and all signals in closed-loop system are uniformly ultimately bounded. Finally, numerical simulation is presented to verify the effectiveness and superiority of proposed control scheme. © 2021 Elsevier Masson SAS",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85120612549&doi=10.1016%2fj.ast.2021.107264&partnerID=40&md5=58c9064b78a2bfd90ca087b8c626a35d,Aerospace Science and Technology,2022
Joint Trajectory and Resource Optimization for UAV-Aided Two-Way Relay Networks,"Unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV)-aided two-way relay networks with multiple terrestrial user pairs is investigated, where a fix-wing UAV is served as a two-way relay to assist information transmission. We aim to maximize the total rate of the two-way relay networks while the quality of service (QoS) being guaranteed. A novel relay strategy, namely time-slots pairing, is proposed by exploiting physical-layer network coding (PNC) protocol. Specifically, the UAV receives and buffers the signals from the scheduled user pair when the UAV approaches one of them, then forwards the modulated signal when the UAV is close to the other. As a result, a non-convex total rate maximization problem is formulated by joint trajectory design and resource optimization. To solve this problem, we first decompose it into three sub-problems, and then a three-step iterative algorithm that can effectively handle the non-convex problem with no worse than a polynomial complexity is developed leveraging the block coordinate descent (BCD) technique and successive convex approximation (SCA) method. Simulation results finally illustrate that: 1) Compared with amplify-and-forward (AF) or decode-and-forward (DF) protocols, the proposed design based on PNC protocol can significantly improve the total rate of the two-way relay networks; 2) the time-slots pairing relay strategy always achieves a significant enhancement on performance than the traditional non-time-slots pairing relay strategy; 3) the time-slots pairing relay strategy is more favorable for the mobile PNC relay networks since it can well resist the degradation of the entire networks caused by users' increased service quality requirements. © 1967-2012 IEEE.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85120562915&doi=10.1109%2fTVT.2021.3130603&partnerID=40&md5=b7f39944c3e6efd7caf45e57b2ad2af7,IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology,2022
Informative path planning for anomaly detection in environment exploration and monitoring,"An unmanned autonomous vehicle (UAV) is sent on a mission to explore and reconstruct an unknown environment from a series of measurements collected by Bayesian optimization. The success of the mission is judged by the UAV's ability to faithfully reconstruct any anomalous features present in the environment, with emphasis on the extremes (e.g., extreme topographic depressions or abnormal chemical concentrations). We show that the criteria commonly used for determining which locations the UAV should visit are ill-suited for this task. We introduce a number of novel criteria that guide the UAV toward regions of strong anomalies by leveraging previously collected information in a mathematically elegant and computationally tractable manner. We demonstrate superiority of the proposed approach in several applications, including reconstruction of seafloor topography from real-world bathymetry data, as well as tracking of dynamic anomalies. A particularly attractive property of our approach is its ability to overcome adversarial conditions, that is, situations in which prior beliefs about the locations of the extremes are imprecise or erroneous. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85120932185&doi=10.1016%2fj.oceaneng.2021.110242&partnerID=40&md5=c6cfd8642ec773424ca1efdc71b962d1,Ocean Engineering,2022
Feedback-Based Ramp Metering and Lane-Changing Control with Connected and Automated Vehicles,"Aiming at operating effectively future traffic systems, we propose here a novel methodology for integrated lane-changing and ramp metering control that exploits the presence of connected vehicles. In particular, we assume that a percentage of vehicles can receive and implement specific control tasks (e.g., lane-changing commands), while ramp metering is available via an infrastructure-based system or enabled by connected vehicles. The proposed approach is designed to robustly maximise the throughput at motorway bottlenecks employing a feedback controller, formulated as a Linear Quadratic Integral regulator, which is based on a simplified linear time invariant traffic flow model. We also present an extremum seeking algorithm to compute the optimal set-points used in the feedback controller, employing only the measurement of a cost that is representative of the achieved traffic conditions. The method is evaluated via simulation experiments, performed on a first-order, multi-lane, macroscopic traffic flow model, also featuring the capacity drop phenomenon, which allows to demonstrate the effectiveness of the developed methodology and to highlight the improvement in terms of the generated congestion.  © 2000-2011 IEEE.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85124653641&doi=10.1109%2fTITS.2020.3018873&partnerID=40&md5=b1eaf172aa0cfb25d7d0af5a89066e92,IEEE Transactions on Intelligent Transportation Systems,2022
Trajectory Planning Based on Spatio-Temporal Map with Collision Avoidance Guaranteed by Safety Strip,"Trajectory planning for the unmanned vehicle in the complex environment has always been a challenging task. Planned trajectory with the corresponding target velocity or acceleration sequence must be collision-free guaranteed and as comfortable as possible on the premise of obeying the traffic rules and interaction with other dynamic social vehicles. To meet this requirement, this paper proposes a framework for trajectory planning based on spatio-Temporal map. Due to the time layer architecture in the map, the trajectory can be generated with velocity and acceleration simultaneously, and the whole trajectory is constrained within a 'safety strip', resulting in an efficient and safety guaranteed trajectory. The framework is composed of three sections: rough search, fine optimization and safety strip-based collision avoidance. For rough search, we propose an improved A∗ algorithm implemented in the discrete time layer to find out the suboptimal states efficiently. In fine optimization, the B-spline curve is exploited to connect the searched states into a continuous trajectory. And the optimal control points of B-spline are further grouped into several segments, forming the safety strip which is actually the distribution space of the planned trajectory. If necessary, an adjustment will be applied to keep the strip away from the collision zone, making the entire trajectory completely collision-free. Experiments on both public dataset and self-driving simulator show that the proposed framework can adapt to different kinds of complex traffic scenes well. © 2000-2011 IEEE.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85124656237&doi=10.1109%2fTITS.2020.3019514&partnerID=40&md5=aa8715f5b834ec7e47a9fa67558032d4,IEEE Transactions on Intelligent Transportation Systems,2022
Single and multiple drones detection and identification using RF based deep learning algorithm,"Unmanned aerial systems, especially drones have gone through remarkable improvement and expansion in recent years. Drones have been widely utilized in many applications and scenarios, due to their low price and ease of use. However, in some applications drones can pose a malicious threat. To diminish risks to public security and personal privacy, it is necessary to deploy an effective and affordable anti-drone system in sensitive areas to detect, localize, identify, and defend against intruding malicious drones. This research article presents a new publicly available radio frequency drone dataset and investigates detection and identification methodologies to detect single or multiple drones and identify a single detected drone's type. Moreover, special attention in this paper has been underlined to examine the possibility of using deep learning algorithms, particularly fully connected deep neural networks as an anti-drone solution within two different radio frequency bands. We proposed a supervised deep learning algorithm with fully-connected deep neural network models that use raw drone signals rather than features. Regarding the research results, the proposed algorithm shows a lot of potentials. The probability of detecting a single drone is 99.8%, and the probability of type identification is 96.1%. Moreover, the results of multiple drones detection demonstrate an average accuracy of 97.3%. There have not been such comprehensive publications, to this time, in the open literature that have presented and enlightened the problem of multiple drones detection in the radio frequency domain. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85115947866&doi=10.1016%2fj.eswa.2021.115928&partnerID=40&md5=c95b79c41e2dfce066bb0fc3ff0ae60b,Expert Systems with Applications,2022
MTH-IDS: A Multitiered Hybrid Intrusion Detection System for Internet of Vehicles,"Modern vehicles, including connected vehicles and autonomous vehicles, nowadays involve many electronic control units connected through intravehicle networks (IVNs) to implement various functionalities and perform actions. Modern vehicles are also connected to external networks through vehicle-to-everything technologies, enabling their communications with other vehicles, infrastructures, and smart devices. However, the improving functionality and connectivity of modern vehicles also increase their vulnerabilities to cyber-attacks targeting both intravehicle and external networks due to the large attack surfaces. To secure vehicular networks, many researchers have focused on developing intrusion detection systems (IDSs) that capitalize on machine learning methods to detect malicious cyber-attacks. In this article, the vulnerabilities of intravehicle and external networks are discussed, and a multitiered hybrid IDS that incorporates a signature-based IDS and an anomaly-based IDS is proposed to detect both known and unknown attacks on vehicular networks. Experimental results illustrate that the proposed system can detect various types of known attacks with 99.99% accuracy on the CAN-intrusion-dataset representing the IVN data and 99.88% accuracy on the CICIDS2017 data set illustrating the external vehicular network data. For the zero-day attack detection, the proposed system achieves high F1-scores of 0.963 and 0.800 on the above two data sets, respectively. The average processing time of each data packet on a vehicle-level machine is less than 0.6 ms, which shows the feasibility of implementing the proposed system in real-time vehicle systems. This emphasizes the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed IDS. © 2014 IEEE.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85107219569&doi=10.1109%2fJIOT.2021.3084796&partnerID=40&md5=69b7502aedf0c346d6b2e7d707bacb2a,IEEE Internet of Things Journal,2022
RAMP-IoD: A Robust Authenticated Key Management Protocol for the Internet of Drones,"Internet of Drones (IoD) is the interconnection of unmanned aerial vehicles or drones deployed for collecting sensitive data to be used in critical applications. The drones transmit the collected data to the control room (CR) for analysis, while CR sends control commands to the drone to monitor their operations. This exchange of information between the drones and CR takes place through a wireless communication channel, which is susceptible to various security risks. Therefore, it is vital to ensure the confidentiality and integrity of such information in the IoD environment. To this end, authenticated key management (AKM) protocols can be leveraged to provide reliable and secure communication. However, due to the peculiarities associated with IoD environments, it is challenging to devise a robust and resource-efficient AKM protocol. To tackle this challenge, in this article, we propose a robust AKM protocol for IoD (RAMP-IoD). RAMP-IoD uses lightweight cryptography-based authenticated encryption primitive and elliptic-curve cryptography along with a hash function to perform the AKM process. Moreover, RAMP-IoD verifies the user's authenticity and then sets up a session key (SK) between the user and a specific drone for indecipherable communications. We verify the security of SK using the random oracle model. Scyther-based validation demonstrates that RAMP-IoD is protected against replay and man-in-the-middle attacks. Moreover, the informal analysis illustrates that RAMP-IoD is secure against various covert security attacks. Through a comparative study, we also demonstrate that RAMP-IoD provides enhanced security with low storage, communication, and computational overheads as compared to related AKM protocols. © 2014 IEEE.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85107327322&doi=10.1109%2fJIOT.2021.3084946&partnerID=40&md5=ddd2eab1840d49fcc6209912b725b45e,IEEE Internet of Things Journal,2022
Chiller Fault Diagnosis Based on VAE-Enabled Generative Adversarial Networks,"Artificial intelligence (AI)-enhanced automated fault diagnosis (AFD) has become increasingly popular for chiller fault diagnosis with promising classification performance. In practice, a sufficient number of fault samples are required by the AI methods in the training phase. However, faulty training samples are generally much more difficult to be collected than normal training samples. Data augmentation is introduced in these scenarios to enhance the training data set with synthetic data. In this study, a variational autoencoder-based conditional Wasserstein GAN with gradient penalty (CWGAN-GP-VAE) is proposed to diagnose various faults for chillers. A detailed comparative study has been conducted with real-world fault data samples to verify the effectiveness and robustness of the proposed methodology. Note to Practitioners - This work attacks the fact that faulty training samples are usually much harder to be collected than the normal training samples in the practice of chiller automated fault diagnosis (AFD). Modern supervised learning chiller AFD relies on a sufficient number of faulty training samples to train the classifier. When the number of faulty training samples is insufficient, the conventional AFD methods fail to work. This study proposed a variational autoencoder-based conditional Wasserstein GAN with gradient penalty (CWGAN-GP-VAE) framework for generating synthetic faulty training samples to enrich the training data set for machine learning-based AFD methods. The proposed algorithm has been carefully designed, implemented, and practically proved to be more effective than the existing methods in the literature. © 2004-2012 IEEE.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85096836562&doi=10.1109%2fTASE.2020.3035620&partnerID=40&md5=26f11a453ee3d552eafb519832a45188,IEEE Transactions on Automation Science and Engineering,2022
A Heuristic Distributed Scheme to Detect Falsification of Mobility Patterns in Internet of Vehicles,"Autonomous vehicles in the Internet of Vehicles (IoV) have the ability to generate their mobility pattern in advance and share it with other vehicles or a central location. This information enables traffic systems to be aware of future traffic flow. However, the current classical traffic systems barely consider the spatial dependency of traffic data, and more advanced systems suffer from storage limitations. These problems will be exacerbated by the falsification of traffic data through corresponding data attacks, such as position forging attacks. This, in turn, negatively impacts the performance of traffic management systems. This article proposes a heuristic distributed scheme (HIDE) to validate the mobility pattern of vehicles by penalizing or rewarding vehicles based on the contacts' conformation. HIDE enables every vehicle to consider the claimed mobility pattern of every neighboring vehicle that is exchanged, and assigns a penalty or reward to each received mobility pattern and share with cloudlets via roadside units (RSUs). These calculations are based on an efficient time-homogeneous semi-Markov process (THSMP) to predict the likelihood of the accuracy of mobility patterns. Cloudlets calculate a weight factor to determine if a vehicle is malicious. The validation results from THSMP reveal that a high correlation is achieved between the theoretical model and simulation. Also, the results show that the model fairly identifies the malicious vehicles and assigns a low weight of impact on them compared to normal vehicles.  © 2014 IEEE.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85107347158&doi=10.1109%2fJIOT.2021.3085315&partnerID=40&md5=9afc1c3a4d1cc8a8783391d0452508f1,IEEE Internet of Things Journal,2022
A Push-Based Probabilistic Method for Source Location Privacy Protection in Underwater Acoustic Sensor Networks,"As the research topics in ocean emerge, underwater acoustic sensor networks (UASNs) have become ever more relevant. Consequently, challenges arise with the security and privacy of the UASNs. Compared to the active attacks, the characteristics of passive attacks are more difficult to discriminate. Thus, the focus of this study is on the passive attacks in UASNs, where a push-based probabilistic method for source location privacy protection (PP-SLPP) is proposed. The fake packet technology and the multipath technology are utilized in the PP-SLPP scheme to counter the passive attacks, so as to protect the source location privacy in UASNs. Moreover, the Ekman drift current model is employed to simulate the underwater environment. And the mean shift algorithm and the k-means algorithm are adopted in the dynamic layer and static layer of the Ekman drift current model, respectively, to increase the stability of the clusters. Finally, an autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV) swarm is implemented to collect data in clusters. Through the comparison with existing data collection schemes in UASNs, the simulation results have demonstrated that the PP-SLPP scheme can achieve a longer safety period, with a minor compromise of energy consumption and delay.  © 2014 IEEE.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85107351137&doi=10.1109%2fJIOT.2021.3085586&partnerID=40&md5=a85bffd1e761716ab9af7b9f20ab47e4,IEEE Internet of Things Journal,2022
Sliding mode formation control of leaderless unmanned surface vehicles with environmental disturbances,"This paper, in light of the sliding mode control (SMC) approach, concerns the formation regulation for a network of unmanned surface vehicles (USVs) with environmental disturbances. The formation pattern is configured within the consensus-based leaderless framework. Undirected connected graphs are exploited to portray the network communication in a switching manner. To begin with, thanks to the definition on relative formation error, one mathematically formulates the concerned formation control problem into the leaderless consensus design for resultant formation error systems. Then an integral-type sliding surface is constructed by a collection of neighboring USVs’ position and velocity information. Based on a characterized orthogonal transformation, the regulation of the formation performance upon the sliding surface is cast into the asymptotic stability analysis of the reduce-order sliding mode system. By partitioning the state space into agreement and disagreement subspaces, a formation reference function (FRF) with determined initial condition is derived as a disturbance-free autonomous system, whose dynamical behavior explicitly symbolizes the global movement of the leaderless USV formation system. Finally, to ensure the finite-time reachability of the sliding surface, a distributed sliding mode controller is designed by utilizing the tool from finite-time stabilization technique. As a byproduct, the theoretical analysis is extended to the case of fixed topology. The derived results are validated by some numerical examples. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85121684872&doi=10.1016%2fj.oceaneng.2021.110301&partnerID=40&md5=a865a8c53b584508ab32b9f6b2ef7acd,Ocean Engineering,2022
MCRNet: Multi-level context refinement network for semantic segmentation in breast ultrasound imaging,"Automated semantic segmentation in breast ultrasound imaging remains a challenging task due to the adverse impacts of poor contrast, indistinct target boundaries, and a large number of shadows. Recently, convolutional neural networks (CNN) with U-shape have demonstrated considerable performance in medical image segmentation. However, classic U-shaped networks suffer from the potential semantic gaps due to the incompatibility of encoder and decoder features, thereby resulting in sub-optimal semantic segmentation performance in ultrasound imaging. In this work, we focus on improving the U-shaped CNN through adaptively reducing semantic gaps and enhancing contextual relationships between encoder and decoder features. Specifically, we propose two lightweight yet effective context refinement blocks including inverted residual pyramid block (IRPB) and context-aware fusion block (CFB). The former can selectively extract multi-scale semantic representations according to input features, aiming to adaptively reduce semantic gaps between encoder and decoder features. The latter can exploit semantic interactions of inter-features to enhance contextual correlations between the encoder and the decoder, aiming at improving the feature fusion scheme of low- and high-level features. Further, we develop a novel multi-level context refinement network (MCRNet) by seamlessly plugging these two context refinement blocks into an encoder-decoder architecture according to the multi-level manner, thereby achieving fully automated semantic segmentation in ultrasound imaging. In order to objectively validate the proposed method, we carry out extensive qualitative and quantitative analyses based on two publicly available breast ultrasound databases including BUSI and UDIAT. The experimental results greatly reflect the efficacy of our proposed method. Meanwhile, compared with nine state-of-the-art semantic segmentation methods, our proposed MCRNet also achieves superior performance while persevering fine computational efficiency. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85119341190&doi=10.1016%2fj.neucom.2021.10.102&partnerID=40&md5=06f1265050cbaccb47fea51be05fc853,Neurocomputing,2022
Optimizing Fuel Consumption in Thrust Allocation for Marine Dynamic Positioning Systems,"In offshore maritime operations, automated systems capable of maintaining the vessel's position and heading using its own propellers and thrusters to compensate exogenous disturbances, like wind, waves, and currents, are referred to as marine dynamic positioning (DP) systems. DP systems play a central role in several marine operations, such as drilling, pipe-laying, coring, and ocean observation. These operations are the primary cause of fuel consumption, having a strong impact on the overall footprint of the vessel. For this reason, we will face the problem of optimal thrust allocation of an over-actuated vessel to maintain position and heading with minimal fuel consumption. State-of-the-art approaches simplify this problem by roughly approximating it and obtain a simple, mostly convex, optimization problem that can be solved in near-real time by the automation system. In this article, we improve current approaches with the following contributions. We will exploit a higher fidelity representation of the physical system, and we will manipulate the resulting optimization problem accordingly, to allow for near-real-time solutions on conventional computing platforms on-board. We evaluate the quality of the proposal with a case study on a drilling unit equipped with six thrusters. The results will show that it is possible to achieve up to 5% of fuel savings with respect to conventional approaches. Note to Practitioners - This article was motivated by the problem of minimizing fuel consumption in thrust allocation of DP systems. The current approaches simplify this issue by adopting simpler, yet related, optimization problems as surrogates, keeping the problem tractable for near-real-time control. We propose, instead, to solve the original problem with state-of-the-art modelization of the physical system and exploit reasonable and theoretical proprietaries to achieve optimal solutions in near-real-time. The results on a drilling unit will show additional fuel savings of up to 5% with respect to alternative state-of-the-art approaches.  © 2004-2012 IEEE.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85104195901&doi=10.1109%2fTASE.2021.3069779&partnerID=40&md5=54d946edf2bdfb72120d7a48b98788f0,IEEE Transactions on Automation Science and Engineering,2022
Generative synthesis of logos across DCT domain,"Generative learning in pixel domain has achieved great success in exploiting their correlations in processing images towards desired objectives, yet learning in frequency domain could provide added benefits in exploiting pixel correlations without worrying about their spatial locations and increasing their modeling costs. In this paper, we analyze the spectral bias from a frequency perspective to overcome such limitations and hence propose a dynamic self-adaptive optimization on GAN-based generative learning, leading to a dynamic and generative logo synthesis in DCT domain. To achieve exploitation of all the pixel correlations inside the whole image regardless of their spatial locations, we introduce an approximated DCT transformation and decompose both the input images and the generated images into relatively independent DCT frequency bands. As a result, a new channel of DCT domain generative learning can be established to support the existing pixel domain learning towards improved logo synthesis. Since learning across different frequency band constantly varies, we further propose a dynamic optimization scheme to maximize the effectiveness of contributions from each individual DCT frequency band. Extensive experiments are carried out and the results in comparison with the existing state of the arts illustrate that our proposed achieves significant superiority in terms of both synthesized logo quality, integrity and variety. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85117104785&doi=10.1016%2fj.neucom.2021.09.068&partnerID=40&md5=2590738deafb483f516cf25f16bb115d,Neurocomputing,2022

New Aspects of Integrity Levels in Automotive Industry-Cybersecurity of Automated Vehicles,"The spread of connected vehicles is expected to multiply the effects of the growing penetration of cyberspace in our life, and with this it remarkably influences the vulnerability of society to cyberattacks in an unfavorable way. Accordingly, ZalalZone-the Hungarian test track-has set up a working group to support the necessary methodological background for cybersecurity-related validation processes for the automotive industry. Therefore the paper aims to reconsider safety integrity levels in the automotive industry related to the field of cybersecurity. Following this, the article provides a comprehensive structure of integrity levels that serves the safety requirements of nowadays new cybersecurity challenges. To adapt the new cybersecurity integrity level architecture to the conventional automotive safety integrity level framework, the authors have verified a specific clustering model. To validate the aggregated probability of the possible cyberattack alternatives, the generated new cybersecurity rating scale is compared with the ASIL probability values by applying the Kolmogorov-Smirnov test.

Hybrid-Learning-Based Driver Steering Intention Prediction Using Neuromuscular Dynamics,"The emerging automated driving technology poses a new challenge to driver-automation collaboration, which requires a mutual understanding between humans and machines through their intention identifications. In this article, oriented by human-machine mutual understanding, a driver steering intention prediction method is proposed to better understand human driver’s expectation during driver-vehicle interaction. The steering intention is predicted based on a novel hybrid-learning-based time-series model with deep learning networks. Two different driving modes, namely, both hands and single right-hand driving modes, are studied. Different electromyography signals from the upper limb muscles are collected and used for the steering intention prediction. The relationship between the neuromuscular dynamics and the steering torque is analyzed first. Then, the hybrid-learning-based model is developed to predict both the continuous and discrete steering intentions. The two intention prediction networks share the same temporal pattern exaction layer, which is built with the bidirectional recurrent neural network and long shortterm memory cells. The model prediction performance is evaluated with a varied history and prediction horizon to exploit the model capability further. The experimental data are collected from 21 participants of varied ages and driving experience. The results show that the proposed method can achieve a prediction accuracy of around 95% steering under the two driving modes. © 2021 IEEE.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85101743697&doi=10.1109%2fTIE.2021.3059537&partnerID=40&md5=4f2dbb10eec7459d91292c10db151383,IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics,2022
Joint Altitude and Hybrid Beamspace Precoding Optimization for UAV-Enabled Multiuser mmWave MIMO System,"The combination of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) and millimeter wave (mmWave) multiple-input multiple-out (MIMO) system is regarded as a key enabling technology for beyond 5G networks, as it provides high data rate aerial links. However, establishing UAV-enabled mmWave MIMO communication is quite challenging due to the high hardware cost in terms of radio frequency (RF) chains. As a cost-effective alternative, a beamspace precoding with discrete lens arrays (DLA) architecture has received considerable attention. However, the underlying optimal design in beamspace precoding has not been fully exploited in UAV-enabled communication scenario. In this paper, the joint design of the UAV's altitude and hybrid beamspace precoding is proposed for the UAV-enabled multiuser MIMO system, in which the DLA is exploited to reduce the number of the RF chain. In the proposed scheme, the optimization problem is formulated as a minimum weighted mean squared error (MWMSE) method. Then an efficient algorithm with the penalty dual decomposition (PDD) is proposed that aims to jointly optimize the altitude of UAV, beam selection and digital precoding matrices. Simulation results confirm the comparable performance of the proposed scheme and perform close to full-digital beamforming in terms of achievable spectral efficiency. © 1967-2012 IEEE.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85121833010&doi=10.1109%2fTVT.2021.3134044&partnerID=40&md5=1229df62004c9fe74f07cb33e53f63f7,IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology,2022
Robust Coordinated Hybrid Source Seeking with Obstacle Avoidance in Multivehicle Autonomous Systems,"In multivehicle autonomous systems that operate under unknown or adversarial environments, it is a challenging task to simultaneously achieve source seeking and obstacle avoidance. Indeed, even for single-vehicle systems, smooth time-invariant feedback controllers based on navigation or barrier functions have been shown to be highly susceptible to arbitrarily small jamming signals that can induce instability in the closed-loop system, or that are able to stabilize spurious equilibria in the operational space. When the location of the source is further unknown, adaptive smooth source seeking dynamics based on averaging theory may suffer from similar limitations. In this article, we address this problem by introducing a class of novel distributed hybrid model-free controllers, that achieve robust source seeking and obstacle avoidance in multivehicle autonomous systems, with vehicles characterized by nonlinear continuous-time dynamics stabilizable by hybrid feedback. The hybrid source seeking law switches between a family of cooperative gradient-free controllers, derived from potential fields that satisfy mild invexity assumptions. The stability and robustness properties of the closed-loop system are analyzed using Lyapunov tools and singular perturbation theory for set-valued hybrid dynamical systems. The theoretical results are validated via numerical and experimental tests.  © 1963-2012 IEEE.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85100725279&doi=10.1109%2fTAC.2021.3056365&partnerID=40&md5=dd79b052f92ae1055477de2de18c8246,IEEE Transactions on Automatic Control,2022
Subline frequency setting for autonomous minibusses under demand uncertainty,"Over the last years, there have been initiated several pilots with autonomous minibusses. Unlike regular bus services, autonomous minibusses serve a limited number of stops and have more flexible schedules since they do not require bus drivers. This allows the operation of a line through a flexible combination of sublines, where a subline serves a subset of consecutive stops in the same order as the original line. This paper studies the subline frequency setting (SFS) problem under uncertain passenger demand. We present a frequency setting model that assigns autonomous minibusses to sublines in order to exploit the available resources as much as possible and minimize the operational and passenger waiting time costs. Passenger waiting time costs may depend on the combination of several lines whose frequencies cannot be perfectly aligned for each passenger journey. We present a new estimation of the expected waiting time for passengers to improve the accuracy of the passenger waiting time costs in the case of sublines. Our SFS model is originally formulated as a MINLP and reformulated as a MILP that can be solved to global optimality. Further, we explicitly consider the uncertainty of passenger demand in the optimization process by formulating a stochastic optimization model. The performances of our stochastic and deterministic models that assign minibusses to sublines are tested under various passenger demand scenarios in the 14-stop autonomous minibus line in Eberbach, Germany and a fictional bus line with 20 bus stops. Results show potential improvements in operational costs in the range of 10%–40% depending on the passenger demand profile. © 2021 The Author(s)",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85121722747&doi=10.1016%2fj.trc.2021.103492&partnerID=40&md5=4e3c4adc822a588d56a23e563815a0d7,Transportation Research Part C: Emerging Technologies,2022
Cooperative Control of Physical Collision and Transmission Power for UAV Swarm: A Dual-Fields Enabled Approach,"This article studies the collision avoidance and interference mitigation for unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) swarm where many UAVs track a common target. The considered problem is formulated to jointly minimize the average interference and ensure the collision avoidance among UAVs. By exploiting the problem characteristics, our major contributions are summarized as follows. First, the singular case tolerance (SCT)-artificial potential field (APF) is proposed to overcome the failure of traditional APFs in collision avoidance, where the repulsive force gain coefficient among UAVs is dynamically controlled by the corresponding interferences. Second, the mean-field game (MFG) model is established to control communication power, where the instantaneous interferences among flying UAVs are represented by the mean-field approximation. Third, considering the tight coupling of trajectory and interference of UAVs, a cooperative control approach enabled by dual-fields is proposed to jointly adjust the trajectories and power of UAVs. Simulation results validate the significant performance improvement of the cooperative control approach enabled by dual-fields. Compared with separate APF and MFG, the proposed dual-field-cooperation approach can achieve about 117% throughput gain and 88% interference reduction when the UAV swarm is close to the target. © 2021 IEEE.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85110836771&doi=10.1109%2fJIOT.2021.3096955&partnerID=40&md5=645d0c79345faa05cf1365ccaa77ebca,IEEE Internet of Things Journal,2022
Stochastic Optimization-Aided Energy-Efficient Information Collection in Internet of Underwater Things Networks,"In the face of deeply exploring and exploiting marine resources, the Internet of Underwater Things (IoUT) networks have drawn great attention considering its widely distributed low-cost and easy-deployment smart sensing nodes. However, given the hostile underwater environment, it is critical to conceive energy-efficient information collection because of limited underwater energy supply and inefficient artificial recharge methods. Characterized by high flexibility and maneuverability, autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs) are regarded as a promising solution for information collection in the IoUT relying upon delicate AUVs' trajectory and information collection strategy design with the spirit of balancing their energy consumption and information processing capability. In this article, we propose a heterogeneous AUV-aided information collection system with the aim of maximizing the energy efficiency of IoUT nodes taking into account AUV trajectory, resource allocation, and the Age of Information (AoI). Moreover, based on the particle swarm optimization (PSO), we obtain the trajectory of AUVs with low time complexity. Additionally, a two-stage joint optimization algorithm based on the Lyapunov optimization is constructed to strike a tradeoff between energy efficiency and system queue backlog iteratively. Finally, simulation results validate the effectiveness and superiority of our proposed strategy. 2327-4662 © 2021 IEEE.

Adversarial Game Against Hybrid Attacks in UAV Communications with Partial Information,"Unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) communications are vulnerable to smart attacks, where the attacker can change the attack mode (e.g., eavesdropping and jamming) via smart radio devices. To ensure secure transmissions against hybrid attacks, UAVs may transmit confidential information and misleading information alternately. In this paper, we consider a dynamic anti-hybrid attack framework with trajectory optimization, where both a UAV and an attacker attempt to find their optimal trajectories without knowing the information type and the attack mode of each other. Given the major challenge due to incomplete knowledge (i.e., each agent knows only its own information), we establish an adversarial game with partial-observation feature to formulate an optimization problem, and propose a counterfactual regret minimization learning scheme to achieve the correlated equilibrium for both the UAV and attacker. Simulation results validate the superiority of our scheme over a benchmark in UAV communication scenarios with partial information. © 1967-2012 IEEE.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85121362053&doi=10.1109%2fTVT.2021.3132934&partnerID=40&md5=f947a55b6ed5b3c1be911fb213d252df,IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology,2022
Multi-strategy fusion differential evolution algorithm for UAV path planning in complex environment,"The path planning of Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) is a real-world optimization problem, and even develops into a hard optimization problem with many objectives and constraints when UAVs work in a complex environment. In a complex environment, the resulting constraints can lead to decrease the quantity of the feasible solutions, so that can bring difficulties to plan routes for UAVs. Therefore, it is necessary to design a high-quality planner for a UAV in a complex environment. In this work, we have proposed a Multi-Strategy Fusion Differential Evolution algorithm (MSFDE). The proposed algorithm integrates the multi-population strategy, the novel self-adaptive strategy and the ensemble of the interactive mutation strategy in order to balance the exploitation and exploration capabilities. The multi-population strategy is used to divide the whole population into the three indicator subpopulations and a reward subpopulation for maintaining the diversity of the whole population; the novel self-adaptive strategy is introduced to control the parameters F and CR based on the teaching-learning-based optimization method; the ensemble of the interactive mutation strategy is to exchange the information among the three indicator subpopulations on each generation for boosting the population diversity. The constraints in the UAV path planning are transformed into the objective functions by the linear weighted sum method. Scenario 1, 2, 3, and 4 are designed with different complex level, and other eight algorithms are introduced to be compared with MSFDE. The simulation results confirm that MSFDE has an outstanding performance for the UAV three-dimensional path planning in the complex environment. © 2021 Elsevier Masson SAS",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85122593224&doi=10.1016%2fj.ast.2021.107287&partnerID=40&md5=19a8d508da5f02c13ef878f93240f86e,Aerospace Science and Technology,2022
Fully Onboard AI-Powered Human-Drone Pose Estimation on Ultralow-Power Autonomous Flying Nano-UAVs,"Many emerging applications of nano-sized unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), with a few cm2 form-factor, revolve around safely interacting with humans in complex scenarios, for example, monitoring their activities or looking after people needing care. Such sophisticated autonomous functionality must be achieved while dealing with severe constraints in payload, battery, and power budget (100mW). In this work, we attack a complex task going from perception to control: to estimate and maintain the nano-UAV's relative 3-D pose with respect to a person while they freely move in the environment—a task that, to the best of our knowledge, has never previously been targeted with fully onboard computation on a nano-sized UAV. Our approach is centered around a novel vision-based deep neural network (DNN), called Frontnet, designed for deployment on top of a parallel ultra-low power (PULP) processor aboard a nano-UAV. We present a vertically integrated approach starting from the DNN model design, training, and dataset augmentation down to 8-bit quantization and deployment in-field. PULP-Frontnet can operate in real-time (up to 135 frame/s), consuming less than 87 mW for processing at peak throughput and down to 0.43 mJ/frame in the most energy-efficient operating point. Field experiments demonstrate a closed-loop top-notch autonomous navigation capability, with a tiny 27-g Crazyflie 2.1 nano-UAV. Compared against an ideal sensing setup, onboard pose inference yields excellent drone behavior in terms of median absolute errors, such as positional (onboard: 41cm, ideal: 26 cm) and angular (onboard: 3.7°, ideal: 4.1°). We publicly release videos and the source code of our work. © 2021 IEEE.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85112417836&doi=10.1109%2fJIOT.2021.3091643&partnerID=40&md5=e54fe8396299a723f44e536786ff4173,IEEE Internet of Things Journal,2022
Aerodynamic reduced-order Volterra model of an ornithopter under high-amplitude flapping,"The unsteady aerodynamics of flapping low-aspect-ratio ellipsoidal-wings in ornithopters is analyzed and modeled by the use of three dimensional Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) simulations. The range of interest is high amplitude, moderate frequency flapping, and low to moderate angles of attack at Reynolds around 105, where autonomous ornithopters like GRIFFIN are able to perform complex maneuvers such as perching. The results obtained show that the Leading Edge Vortex is produced above a certain Strouhal and angle of attack at downstroke. The frequency response of the aerodynamic loads are compared with the classical analytical models, observing that analytical models based on absence of viscosity and small perturbations are not appropriate for the range of interest. Through the 3D CFD aerodynamic loads database, a finite memory Volterra model is identified in order to predict the characteristics of forces and moments produced by the flapping wing. A good agreement with the 3D CFD simulations has been found by considering a reduced-order model depending on the effective angle of attack of the surrogate airfoil located at 70% of the semi-span at three-quarters chord on the airfoil, in agreement with the literature. Finally, a methodology for validation with a high-accuracy Motion Capture System and without the need of wind tunnel is proposed. As a result the proposed model provides better estimates than classical analytical ones. © 2022 The Author(s)",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85123033262&doi=10.1016%2fj.ast.2022.107331&partnerID=40&md5=626d660f4661b5ecfc01e6f474afc4b5,Aerospace Science and Technology,2022
Access Control Protocol for Battlefield Surveillance in Drone-Assisted IoT Environment,"Surveillance drones, called as unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), are aircrafts that are utilized to collect video recordings, still images, or live video of the targets, such as vehicles, people or specific areas. Particularly in battlefield surveillance, there is high possibility of eavesdropping, inserting, modifying or deleting the messages during communications among the deployed drones and ground station server (GSS). This leads to launch several potential attacks by an adversary, such as main-in-middle, impersonation, drones hijacking, replay attacks, etc. Moreover, anonymity and untraceability are two crucial security properties that need to be maintained in battlefield surveillance communication environment. To deal with such a crucial security problem, we propose a new access control protocol for battlefield surveillance in drone-assisted Internet of Things (IoT) environment, called ACPBS-IoT. Through the detailed security analysis using formal and informal (nonmathematical), and also the formal security verification under automated software simulation tool, we show that the proposed ACPBS-IoT can resist several potential attacks needed in a battlefield surveillance scenario. Furthermore, the testbed experiments for various cryptographic primitives have been performed for measuring the execution time. Finally, a detailed comparative study on communication and computational overheads, and security, as well as functionality features, reveals that the proposed ACPBS-IoT provides superior security and more functionality features, and better or comparable overheads than other existing competing access control schemes. © 2014 IEEE.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85099216108&doi=10.1109%2fJIOT.2020.3049003&partnerID=40&md5=efed6716538c32be4a4dadf3b8746c71,IEEE Internet of Things Journal,2022
Evolutionary Game Based Strategy Selection for Hybrid V2V Communications,"Vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) communications is an important technology in vehicular ad hoc network (VANET) to support autonomous data exchange among vehicles. Multiple V2V communications modes have been investigated for VANET, including dedicated short-range communications (DSRC) based on IEEE 802.11p and LTE-V2X, which are suitable for different packet transmission cases. In order to fully exploit the strengths of various modes, hybrid V2V communications strategies are designed in this paper, where each vehicle is allowed to choose different modes for different kinds of transmissions in separate frequency bands for transmission throughput improvement. Furthermore, since it is usually impractical to decide all the vehicles' communications strategies globally due to high computational complexity and heavy overhead to broadcast the decisions, we model the selection of hybrid V2V communications strategies for vehicles as an evolutionary game. A strategy selection algorithm is then proposed, where each vehicle can select its hybrid V2V communications strategy locally based on its evaluation of the payoffs for different strategies and limited signalling from the base station. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed algorithm can converge to an asymptotic stable state, which can improve the transmission throughput of vehicles, and is robust to the slight evaluation errors of payoffs and the strategy mutations of a few vehicles. © 1967-2012 IEEE.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85120893442&doi=10.1109%2fTVT.2021.3132025&partnerID=40&md5=2d5109228166390c691d343a9f450e0e,IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology,2022
Graph-Based Intrusion Detection System for Controller Area Networks,"The controller area network (CAN) is the most widely used intra-vehicular communication network in the automotive industry. Because of its simplicity in design, it lacks most of the requirements needed for a security-proven communication protocol. However, a safe and secured environment is imperative for autonomous as well as connected vehicles. Therefore CAN security is considered one of the important topics in the automotive research community. In this article, we propose a four-stage intrusion detection system that uses the chi-squared method and can detect any kind of strong and weak cyber attacks in a CAN. This work is the first-ever graph-based defense system proposed for the CAN. Our experimental results show that we have a very low 5.26% misclassification for denial of service (DoS) attack, 10% misclassification for fuzzy attack, 4.76% misclassification for replay attack, and no misclassification for spoofing attack. In addition, the proposed methodology exhibits up to 13.73% better accuracy compared to existing ID sequence-based methods. © 2000-2011 IEEE.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85127572084&doi=10.1109%2fTITS.2020.3025685&partnerID=40&md5=3c1f244cb0fbd749faa9b8873a970722,IEEE Transactions on Intelligent Transportation Systems,2022
UAV-Assisted Physical Layer Security in Multi-Beam Satellite-Enabled Vehicle Communications,"In this paper, we investigate unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) assisted physical layer security in multi-beam satellite enabled vehicle communications. Particularly, the UAV is exploited as a relay to improve the secure satellite-to-vehicle link, and simultaneously serves as a jammer by deliberately generating artificial noise (AN) to confuse Eve. The satellite beamforming (BF) and UAV power allocation (PA) are jointly optimized to maximize the secrecy rate of the legitimate user within a target beam while guaranteeing the quality of service (QoS) of users within other beams. Since the problem is nonconvex, we first convert it into an equivalent two-stage problem. Then, the outer-stage problem is solved by using one-dimensional search, and the inner-stage problem is transformed to a bi-convex problem by using the semi-definite relaxation (SDR) and Charnes Cooper transformation. To solve the inner-stage bi-convex problem, we propose an iterative alternating optimization algorithm, where the optimal BF is obtained by semi-definite programming (SDP), and the optimal UAV PA is subsequently obtained by solving the reformulated fractional programming problem with an iterative Dinkelbach method. The tightness of SDR and the complexity of our proposed approach are analyzed, and extensive simulations are carried out to evaluate the effectiveness of our proposed approach. © 2000-2011 IEEE.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85112418457&doi=10.1109%2fTITS.2021.3090017&partnerID=40&md5=1aa84280fe16970e2484057170689977,IEEE Transactions on Intelligent Transportation Systems,2022
BCC: Blockchain-Based Collaborative Crowdsensing in Autonomous Vehicular Networks,"The vehicular crowdsensing, which benefits from edge computing devices (ECDs) distributedly selecting autonomous vehicles (AVs) to complete the sensing tasks and collecting the sensing results, represents a practical and promising solution to facilitate the autonomous vehicular networks (AVNs). With frequent data transaction and rewards distribution in the crowdsensing process, how to design an integrated scheme which guarantees the privacy of AVs and enables the ECDs to earn rewards securely while minimizing the task execution cost (TEC) therefore becomes a challenge. To this end, in this article, we develop a blockchain-based collaborative crowdsensing (BCC) scheme to support secure and efficient vehicular crowdsensing in AVNs. In the BCC, by considering the potential attacks in the crowdsensing process, we first develop a secure crowdsensing environment by designing a blockchain-based transaction architecture to deal with privacy and security issues. With the designed architecture, we then propose a coalition game with a transferable reward to motivate AVs to cooperatively execute the crowdsensing tasks by jointly considering the requirements of the tasks and the available sensing resources of AVs. After that, based on the merge and split rules, a coalition formation algorithm is designed to help each ECD select a group of AVs to form the optimal crowdsensing coalition (OCC) with the target of minimizing the TEC. Finally, we evaluate the TEC of the task and the rewards of the ECDs by comparing the proposed scheme with other schemes. The results show that our scheme can lead to a lower TEC for completing crowdsensing tasks and bring higher rewards to ECDs than the conventional schemes.  © 2014 IEEE.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85113241019&doi=10.1109%2fJIOT.2021.3105547&partnerID=40&md5=d2177161a541caec49d80880bd851a09,IEEE Internet of Things Journal,2022
Appearance-Based Loop Closure Detection via Locality-Driven Accurate Motion Field Learning,"Loop closure detection (LCD) is of significant importance in simultaneous localization and mapping. It represents the robot's ability to recognize whether the current surrounding corresponds to a previously observed one. In this paper, we conduct this task in a two-step strategy: candidate frame selection and loop closure verification. The first step aims to search semantically similar images for the query one using features obtained by Key.Net with HardNet. Instead of adopting the traditional Bag-of-Words strategy, we utilize the aggregated selective match kernel to calculate the similarity between images. Subsequently, based on the potential property of motion field in the LCD scene, we propose a novel feature matching method, i.e., exploiting the smoothness prior and learning the motion field for an image pair in a reproducing kernel Hilbert space (RKHS), to implement loop closure verification. Concretely, we formulate the learning problem into a Bayesian framework with latent variables indicating the true/false correspondences and a mixture model accounting for the distribution of data. Furthermore, we propose a locality-driven mechanism to enhance the local relevance of motion vectors and term the algorithm as locality-driven accurate motion field learning (LAL). To satisfy the requirement of efficiency in the LCD task, we use a sparse approximation and search a suboptimal solution for the motion field in the RKHS, termed as LAL∗. Extensive experiments are conducted on public datasets for feature matching and LCD tasks. The quantitative results demonstrate the effectiveness of our method over the current state-of-the-art, meanwhile showing its potential for long-term visual localization.

Distributed Double-Layer Control for Coordination of Multiplatoons Approaching Road Restriction in the Presence of IoV Communication Delays,"Internet of Vehicle (IoV) has become a hot topic in the last years due to its significant benefits in transportation systems in terms of quality, costs, and traffic management capability. Indeed, accurate and real-time information acquisition and diffusion are required to reach an efficient traffic management system according to the smart city paradigm. In this context, this article provides a novel IoV-based distributed double layer control architecture to address the coordination control problem of connected autonomous vehicles (CAVs) multiple platoons negotiating the access to a road section restriction in the presence of heterogeneous communication time-varying delays. To this aim, leveraging the IoV paradigm and the equivalent virtual formation concept, we propose a novel distributed diffusive longitudinal protocol and a distributed lateral potential-function-based control strategy, where both of them are able to cope with communication delays and ensuring the multiplatoon coordination in finite time, i.e., before accessing the road section restrictions, so to avoid vehicles collisions. The finite-time stability of both the cooperative controllers is analytically proved by exploiting the Lyapunov-Krasovskii theory and the derived delay-dependent stability conditions, expressed as a set of linear matrix inequalities (LMIs), allows the proper tuning of the controllers gains. Numerical analysis confirms the theoretical derivation and discloses the effectiveness and the robustness of the proposed cooperative multiplatoon control in ensuring the safe crossing of the road section restriction in finite time.  © 2014 IEEE.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85112160744&doi=10.1109%2fJIOT.2021.3102841&partnerID=40&md5=69c55ad6a37a957e254edd5a50c2e227,IEEE Internet of Things Journal,2022
"Modeling, Detecting, and Mitigating Threats against Industrial Healthcare Systems: A Combined Software Defined Networking and Reinforcement Learning Approach","The rise of the Internet of Medical Things introduces the healthcare ecosystem in a new digital era with multiple benefits, such as remote medical assistance, real-time monitoring, and pervasive control. However, despite the valuable healthcare services, this progression raises significant cybersecurity and privacy concerns. In this article, we focus our attention on the IEC 60 870-5-104 protocol, which is widely adopted in industrial healthcare systems. First, we investigate and assess the severity of the IEC 60 870-5-104 cyberattacks by providing a quantitative threat model, which relies on Attack Defence Trees and Common Vulnerability Scoring System v3.1. Next, we introduce an intrusion detection and prevention system (IDPS), which is capable of discriminating and mitigating automatically the IEC 60 870-5-104 cyberattacks. The proposed IDPS takes full advantage of the machine learning (ML) and software defined networking (SDN) technologies. ML is used to detect the IEC 60 870-5-104 cyberattacks, utilizing 1) Transmission Control Protocol/Internet Protocol network flow statistics and 2) IEC 60 870-5-104 payload flow statistics. On the other side, the automated mitigation is transformed into a multiarmed bandit problem, which is solved through a reinforcement learning method called Thomson sampling and SDN. The evaluation analysis demonstrates the efficiency of the proposed IDPS in terms of intrusion detection accuracy and automated mitigation performance.

Multi-objective robust energy management for environment powered unmanned surface vehicles,"The environment powered unmanned surface vehicle (EPUSV) is capable of achieving large-range and long-term marine operations by harvesting abundant environment energy. However, considering the intermittency of environment energy, limitation on battery capacity and varieties of loads, it is necessary to control and coordinate the electric devices of EPUSV to exploit energy efficiently. To address this issue, an optimization-based energy management strategy (EMS) is proposed in this paper to achieve optimal management for the devices of EPUSV. The operation constraints and relevant objectives of different types of devices are firstly modeled through mix-integer nonlinear programming (MINLP) method. The uncertainty parameters in the model are addressed by robust optimization method. Then various task modes are defined based on the preference for different objectives. Simulations indicate that the proposed method is able to achieve optimal scheduling for each device while satisfying the underlying operation constraints. Besides, the adaptability for different kinds of tasks and the robustness to the fluctuation of uncertainty parameters of the proposed EMS is analyzed and discussed. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85123846264&doi=10.1016%2fj.oceaneng.2022.110624&partnerID=40&md5=42edc5aaa598aadef4a5c15dc080e5e9,Ocean Engineering,2022
Third Eye: An Intelligent and Secure Route Planning Scheme for Critical Services Provisions in Internet of Vehicles Environment,"The advancements in Internet of Things have augmented the importance of innovation and smart technologies, such as self-driving, self-monitoring, and self-controlling as key enablers for future intelligent transport system (ITS). In ITS, critical services such as rescue and disaster, medical emergency, etc., require an efficient route planning by considering performance parameters such as delay, energy, and service-level agreements during peak and off-peak hours. The ignorance of these performance parameters can lead to loss of life, or financial property, or service users. Therefore, Third Eye, a secure information management scheme is proposed by satisfying all the performance parameters as well as satisfying the trust metrics among the vehicles and devices.

Secrecy Energy Efficiency Maximization in UAV-Enabled Wireless Sensor Networks Without Eavesdropper's CSI,"Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) are anticipated to be a potential data collection solution for wireless sensor networks (WSNs). The main challenges of integrating UAVs in WSNs are security threats and UAV's onboard energy limitation. To cope with these two challenges, this article examines the secrecy energy efficiency (SEE) maximization problem in UAV-enabled WSN. Specifically, a full-duplex (FD) UAV gathers confidential information from ground sensor nodes (SNs) in the uplink while sending jamming signals to confound a ground eavesdropper (Eve) in the downlink. Considering a passive eavesdropping scenario lacking Eve's instantaneous channel state information (CSI), the resulting problem is subject to the constraints of connection outage probability (COP), secrecy outage probability (SOP), securely collected bits, and flight trajectory. To tackle the intractable nonconvex problem, we first derive the optimal codeword rate and redundancy rate in closed-form expressions and then develop a low-complexity algorithm using the block coordinate descent (BCD) approach to alternatively optimize the SN scheduling, SN transmit power, UAV transmit power, and UAV trajectory. Simulation results verify the performance gains of the proposed scheme compared with the benchmark schemes. In particular, the proposed scheme achieves nearly the same secrecy rate gains at a lower UAV's energy consumption cost than the sum secrecy rate maximization (SSRM) baseline. Moreover, it is revealed that trajectory optimization of the proposed scheme plays a crucial role in improving SEE performance compared with the circle trajectory (CT) baseline.  © 2014 IEEE.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85111002051&doi=10.1109%2fJIOT.2021.3098049&partnerID=40&md5=4e67be3d799a1cd171c5233066ea564c,IEEE Internet of Things Journal,2022
Challenges and Countermeasures for Adversarial Attacks on Deep Reinforcement Learning,"Deep reinforcement learning (DRL) has numerous applications in the real world, thanks to its ability to achieve high performance in a range of environments with little manual oversight. Despite its great advantages, DRL is susceptible to adversarial attacks, which precludes its use in real-life critical systems and applications (e.g., smart grids, traffic controls, and autonomous vehicles) unless its vulnerabilities are addressed and mitigated. To address this problem, we provide a comprehensive survey that discusses emerging attacks on DRL-based systems and the potential countermeasures to defend against these attacks. We first review the fundamental background on DRL and present emerging adversarial attacks on machine learning techniques. We then investigate the vulnerabilities that an adversary can exploit to attack DRL along with state-of-the-art countermeasures to prevent such attacks.

Evaluating Adversarial Attacks on Driving Safety in Vision-Based Autonomous Vehicles,"In recent years, many deep learning models have been adopted in autonomous driving. At the same time, these models introduce new vulnerabilities that may compromise the safety of autonomous vehicles. Specifically, recent studies have demonstrated that adversarial attacks can cause a significant decline in detection precision of deep learning-based 3-D object detection models. Although driving safety is the ultimate concern for autonomous driving, there is no comprehensive study on the linkage between the performance of deep learning models and the driving safety of autonomous vehicles under adversarial attacks. In this article, we investigate the impact of two primary types of adversarial attacks, perturbation attacks, and patch attacks, on the driving safety of vision-based autonomous vehicles rather than the detection precision of deep learning models. In particular, we consider two state-of-the-art models in vision-based 3-D object detection: 1) Stereo R-CNN and 2) DSGN. To evaluate driving safety, we propose an end-to-end evaluation framework with a set of driving safety performance metrics. By analyzing the results of our extensive evaluation experiments, we find that: 1) the attack's impact on the driving safety of autonomous vehicles and the attack's impact on the precision of 3-D object detectors are decoupled and 2) the DSGN model demonstrates stronger robustness to adversarial attacks than the Stereo R-CNN model. In addition, we further investigate the causes behind the two findings with an ablation study. The findings of this article provide a new perspective to evaluate adversarial attacks and guide the selection of deep learning models in autonomous driving.  © 2014 IEEE.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85112632168&doi=10.1109%2fJIOT.2021.3099164&partnerID=40&md5=922ef36026df031f90b3f689cb9b9fac,IEEE Internet of Things Journal,2022
Joint Optimization of Power and Location in Full-Duplex UAV Enabled Systems,"Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) can be used as aerial base stations (BSs) for future small cells. They can increase the spectral efficiency of the small cells due to their higher probability to have line-of-sight (LOS) connections and their mobility as a BS. In this article, in order to show the effectiveness of using full-duplex (FD) technology in UAV networks, we consider a UAV equipped with FD technology (FD-UAV) with imperfect self-interference cancelation as an aerial BS that serves both uplink (UL) and downlink (DL) users simultaneously in a small cell network. We aim to maximize DL sum-rate, whilst prescribing a certain quality of service for UL users, by optimizing the location of FD-UAV and available resources. The problem is nonconvex; so we propose an iterative method by exploiting the difference of convex functions programming to jointly optimize transmission power of users, FD-UAV location, and FD-UAV transmission power. Simulation results are illustrated to show the effectiveness of the proposed method for FD-UAV in comparison with ground BS, in both FD and half-duplex modes. © 2007-2012 IEEE.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85097130926&doi=10.1109%2fJSYST.2020.3036275&partnerID=40&md5=8c908cba2444a4e71fcc8003454a18a8,IEEE Systems Journal,2022
Safety of Automatic Emergency Braking in Platooning,"A platoon comprises a string of consecutive highly automated vehicles traveling together. Platooning allows for increased road utilization and reduced fuel consumption due to short inter-vehicular distances. Safety in terms of guaranteeing no rear-end collisions is of utmost importance for platooning systems to be deployed in practice. We compare how safely emergency braking can be handled by emerging vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) communications on the one hand and by radar-based measurements of existing automatic emergency braking systems (AEBS) on the other. We show that even under conservative assumptions on the V2V communications, such an approach significantly outperforms AEBS with an ideal radar sensor in terms of allowed inter-vehicle distances and response times. Furthermore, we design two emergency braking strategies for platooning based on V2V communications. The first braking strategy assumes centralized coordination by the leading vehicle and exploits necessary optimal conditions of a constrained optimization problem, whereas the second - the more conservative solution - assumes only local information and is distributed in nature. Both strategies are also compared with the AEBS.  © 1967-2012 IEEE.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85122316213&doi=10.1109%2fTVT.2021.3138939&partnerID=40&md5=72082b6440b4a083deedff6ad2da3ce1,IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology,2022
A Generative Adversarial Network Based Learning Approach to the Autonomous Decision Making of High-Speed Trains,"Nowadays, the autonomous driving transportation systems are at the heart of both academic and industry research for the distinguished advantages including increased network capacity, enhanced punctuality, greater flexibility and improved overall safety level. With the responsibility of transporting passengers in a safe, comfortable and efficient way, the decision making method plays a critical position in the autonomous driving of high-speed trains. Focusing on solving the autonomous decision making problem, this paper proposes a novel learning based framework by combining the deep learning technology with the distributed tracking control approach. To cope with the data insufficiency problem in training the deep learning network, a generative adversarial network (GAN) based data argumentation scheme is proposed to generate data samples that have the same distribution with actual data samples, and a hybrid learning network is constructed to predict the speed trajectory from the multi-attribute data with both temporal sequences and static features. Then, based on the model predictive control (MPC) scheme, a distributed tracking control model is formulated to minimize the tracking deviations and balance the performance of punctuality, energy-efficiency and riding comfort. Further, the dual decomposition technique is adopted to deal with the coupling constraints for the safe distance headway such that the separation for the autonomous driving of high-speed trains is achieved. Finally, simulation experiments based on actual scenarios of the Beijing-Shanghai high-speed railway are conducted to illustrate the effectiveness of our methods.  © 1967-2012 IEEE.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85122874752&doi=10.1109%2fTVT.2022.3141880&partnerID=40&md5=087636145717d28668c34fd5ee264fda,IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology,2022
Multitask Cooperative Formation Control of Autonomous Surface Vehicles with Interception of Moving Objects,"In this article, we present one solution to the multitask formation and moving objects interception problem of autonomous surface vehicles (ASVs) using the graph-based approach. The investigated problem includes three subtasks, i.e., to steer agents to a desired geometric pattern, to assign the ASVs for intercepting the moving attacker and forming a new formation, respectively, and to revert to original desired formation after successful interception. A switching strategy is designed to make the ASV switch between different modes. To deal with the nonlinear dynamics of ASV and improve the robustness against model uncertainties and external disturbances, the adaptive backstepping technique is incorporated. It is shown that the group of ASVs can accomplish all the tasks with different courses of attackers. The work offers a more flexible solution for the ASV group where malicious attacker exists. The effectiveness of the proposed approach is illustrated by simulations.  © 1976-2012 IEEE.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85120554923&doi=10.1109%2fJOE.2021.3111725&partnerID=40&md5=43c53bea55b10f1a248aeef8925a40d1,IEEE Journal of Oceanic Engineering,2022
Minimum-Time Quadrotor Waypoint Flight in Cluttered Environments,"We tackle the problem of planning a minimum-time trajectory for a quadrotor over a sequence of specified waypoints in the presence of obstacles while exploiting the full quadrotor dynamics. This problem is crucial for autonomous search and rescue and drone racing scenarios but was, so far, unaddressed by the robotics community in its entirety due to the challenges of minimizing time in the presence of the non-convex constraints posed by collision avoidance. Early works relied on simplified dynamics or polynomial trajectory representations that did not exploit the full actuator potential of a quadrotor and, thus, did not aim at minimizing time. We address this challenging problem by using a hierarchical, sampling-based method with an incrementally more complex quadrotor model. Our method first finds paths in different topologies to guide subsequent trajectory search for a kinodynamic point-mass model. Then, it uses an asymptotically-optimal, kinodynamic sampling-based method based on a full quadrotor model on top of the point-mass solution to find a feasible trajectory with a time-optimal objective. The proposed method is shown to outperform all related baselines in cluttered environments and is further validated in real-world flights at over 60 km/h in one of the world's largest motion capture systems. We release the code open source. © 2016 IEEE.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85125721232&doi=10.1109%2fLRA.2022.3154013&partnerID=40&md5=bfd9045d2b700f3552f6fcd588d072fe,IEEE Robotics and Automation Letters,2022
Drone Detection Using Sparse Lidar Measurements,"Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV) have been serving people, fulfilling various roles in research, industry and military, not to exclude personal entertainment. They have also been in use more often for malicious purposes, such as annoying neighbors, disrupting air-travel, attacking people or infrastructure. Therefore, motivated particularly by malicious uses, the research community has been interested in proposing solutions for detection of UAVs. In this work, we present a ground based aerial target detection system using lidars, relying on sparse detections rather than dense point clouds, with the aim of not only detecting but also estimating their motion and active tracking. We lay a theoretical groundwork to analyse the performance of such a lidar based detection system and help understanding its limitations. The work is complemented with field experiments utilizing a state-of-the-art lidar and several drones of different sizes, showing effectiveness in both detection and tracking using sparse measurements. © 2016 IEEE.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85123733442&doi=10.1109%2fLRA.2022.3145498&partnerID=40&md5=282c72dcfaf610892885e653288869b1,IEEE Robotics and Automation Letters,2022
Motor-Level N-MPC for Cooperative Active Perception With Multiple Heterogeneous UAVs,"This letter introduces a cooperative control framework based on Nonlinear Model Predictive Control (NMPC) for solving an Active Information Acquisition problem (AIA) using a system of multiple multirotor UAVs equipped with onboard sensors. The observation task of the NMPC is a minimum-uncertainty pose estimation of a moving feature which is observed by the multi-UAV system, using a cooperative Kalman filter. The controller considers a full nonlinear model of the multirotors – including the motor-level actuation units and their real constraints in terms of maximum torque – and embeds the Kalman filter estimation uncertainty in its prediction. The framework allows and exploits heterogeneity in the actuation and sensing systems by considering a generic model of UAV – including both quadrotors and tilted-propeller multirotors – and a generic model of range-and-bearing sensor with arbitrary rate and field of view. The capability of the proposed framework to reduce the cooperative estimation uncertainty of a static or a moving feature, thus leading the system to optimal sensing configurations, is demonstrated through Gazebo simulations and real experiments.

Autonomous Single-Image Drone Exploration with Deep Reinforcement Learning and Mixed Reality,"Autonomous exploration is a longstanding goal of the robotics community. Aerial drone navigation has proven to be especially challenging. The stringent requirements on cost, weight, maneuverability, and power consumption do not allow exploration approaches to easily be employed or adapted to different types of environments. End-to-End Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) techniques based on Convolutional Networks approximators, which grant constant-time computation, predefined memory usage, and deliver high visual perception capabilities, represent a very promising alternative to current state of the art solutions relying on metric environment reconstruction. In this work, we address the autonomous exploration problem with aerial robots with a monocular camera based on DRL. Specifically, we propose a novel asymmetric actor-critic model for drone exploration that efficiently leverages ground truth information provided by the simulator environment to speed up learning and enhance final exploration performances. Furthermore, in order to reduce the sim-to-real gap for exploration, we present a novel mixed reality framework that allows an easier, smoother, and safer simulation to real-world transition. Both aspects allow to further exploit the great potential of simulation engines and contribute to reducing the risk associated with directly deploying algorithms on a physical platform with no intermediate step between the simulation and the real world. This is well-known to create several safety concerns and be dangerous when deploying aerial vehicles. Experimental results with a drone exploring multiple environments show the effectiveness of the proposed approach.  © 2016 IEEE.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85125738900&doi=10.1109%2fLRA.2022.3154019&partnerID=40&md5=0baf96b3d8c6cc50768d3788830b8161,IEEE Robotics and Automation Letters,2022
Fast and Robust Registration of Partially Overlapping Point Clouds,"Real-time registration of partially overlapping point clouds has emerging applications in cooperative perception for autonomous vehicles and multi-agent SLAM. The relative translation between point clouds in these applications is higher than in traditional SLAM and odometry applications, which challenges the identification of correspondences and a successful registration. In this paper, we propose a novel registration method for partially overlapping point clouds where correspondences are learned using an efficient point-wise feature encoder, and refined using a graph-based attention network. This attention network exploits geometrical relationships between key points to improve the matching in point clouds with low overlap. At inference time, the relative pose transformation is obtained by robustly fitting the correspondences through sample consensus. The evaluation is performed on the KITTI dataset and a novel synthetic dataset including low-overlapping point clouds with displacements of up to 30 m. The proposed method achieves on-par performance with state-of-the-art methods on the KITTI dataset, and outperforms existing methods for low overlapping point clouds. Additionally, the proposed method achieves significantly faster inference times, as low as 410 ms, between 5 and 35 times faster than competing methods.

"Detection, control and mitigation system for secure vehicular communication","The increase in the safety and privacy of automated vehicle drivers against hazardous cyber-attacks will lead to a considerable reduction in the number of global deaths and injuries. In this sense, the European Commission has focused attention on the security of communications in high-risk systems when receiving a cyber-attack such as automated vehicles. The project SerIoT comes up as an possible solution, providing a useful open and reference framework for real-time monitoring of the traffic exchanged through heterogeneous IoT platforms. This system is capable of recognize suspicious patterns, evaluate them and finally take mitigate actions. The paper presents a use case of the SerIoT project related to rerouting tests in vehicular communication. The goal is to ensure secure and reliable communication among Connected Intelligent Transportation Systems (C-ITS) components (vehicles, infrastructures, etc) using the SerIoT's system capabilities to detect and mitigate possible network attacks. Therefore, fleet management and smart intersection scenarios were chosen, where vehicles equipped with On Board Units (OBU) interact with each other and Road Side Units (RSU) to accomplish an optimal flow of traffic. These equipments use the SerIoT systems to deal with cyber-attacks such as Denial of Service (DoS). Tests have been validated in different scenarios under threats situations. It shows the great performance of the SerIoT system taking the corresponding actions to ensure a continuous and safety traffic flow. © 2021 The Author(s)",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85117796195&doi=10.1016%2fj.vehcom.2021.100425&partnerID=40&md5=240a7a6098680ea93b0ce2ab4b66b5d3,Vehicular Communications,2022
Location-Based Schemes for Mitigating Cyber Threats on Connected and Automated Vehicles: A Survey and Design Framework,"The increased automation and connectivity of vehicles and road infrastructure can make future transportation systems more efficient and smarter and enable new transportation business models. Connected and automated vehicles (CAVs) may form a group of autonomous fleets to transform today's shared mobility services and also play the role of mobile sensors, which share real-time traffic and road information for transportation management. However, these technological advancements also lead to new cyber and physical threats that cause safety hazards or other undesired consequences. Although there have been a large number of papers about identifying and mitigating each type of threat, the lack of design support still challenges security engineering for developing CAVs. This limits the engineering capabilities of original equipment manufacturers to prioritize among multiple system properties, including safety, security, and privacy, and dealing with ever-changing attack surfaces and the power of attackers. This paper surveys security vulnerabilities and defense mechanisms for CAVs from an engineering design perspective. We illustrate how to identify and mitigate physical threats that compromise the safety of individual vehicles and cyber threats that disrupt newly CAV-enabled transportation services in a systematic way. An integrated security engineering process and a multi-layer design framework are presented for providing traceability and guidance in threat identification and mitigation. © 2000-2011 IEEE.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85097961420&doi=10.1109%2fTITS.2020.3038755&partnerID=40&md5=a84d15238ab110c41ce81cdf01a81d26,IEEE Transactions on Intelligent Transportation Systems,2022
LoRCA: Lightweight round block and stream cipher algorithms for IoV systems,"The Internet of Vehicles (IoV) is a disruptive technology that has a great impact on people's lifestyle and activities. Fully autonomous vehicles are the next generation of connected cars. However, IoV systems suffer from several security threats that could offset the intended advantages. To address the security and privacy issues, several cryptographic and non-cryptographic security solutions should be adopted. However, traditional security solutions might burden the IoV network with further complexity and computational overhead. This would translate into additional performance issues in a network already suffering from big data and large-scale challenges. In this context, lightweight security solutions are needed to reduce the required resources in terms of computations, power and memory, and to optimize the network performance in terms of latency and bandwidth. In this paper, we propose a new lightweight cipher scheme, LoRCA, with dynamic key-dependent structure to provide data confidentiality with minimum resources' requirements. To validate our solution's robustness and efficiency within the IoV context, several performance and security tests were performed. The results show that the proposed solution strikes a good balance between the security level and performance. The proposed LoRCA ciphers achieve a high throughput with an enhancement of at least 100% improvement as compared to the Advanced Encryption Standard (AES), 358% compared to Simon, 388% improvement for Speck and 24% improvement compared to our previous one round cipher scheme. © 2021 Elsevier Inc.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85116679343&doi=10.1016%2fj.vehcom.2021.100416&partnerID=40&md5=f7c4a6c016b2a46fdde6fe9f49cf63c9,Vehicular Communications,2022
Multi-UAV Cooperative Localization for Marine Targets Based on Weighted Subspace Fitting in SAGIN Environment,"As an indispensable part of the Internet of Vehicles (IoV), unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) can be deployed for target positioning and navigation in the space-air-ground-integrated network (SAGIN) environment. Maritime target positioning is very important for the safe navigation of ships, hydrographic surveys, and marine resource exploration. Traditional methods typically exploit satellites to locate marine targets in the SAGIN environment, and the location accuracy does not satisfy the requirements of modern ocean observation missions. In order to localize the marine target, we develop a system architecture in this article, which contains UAVs integrated with monostatic multiple-input-multiple-output (MIMO) radars. The main thrust is to estimate the direction-of-arrival (DOA) via MIMO radar. Herein, we consider a general scenario that unknown mutual coupling exist and a novel sparse reconstruction algorithm is proposed. The mutual coupling matrix (MCM) is adopted with the help of its special structure, we formulate the data model as a sparse representation form. Then, two novel matrices, a weighted matrix, and a reduced-dimensional matrix are constructed to reduce the computational complexity and enhance the sparsity, respectively. Thereafter, a sparse constraint model is constructed using the concept of optimal weighted subspace fitting (WSF). Finally, the DOA estimation of maritime targets can be achieved by reconstructing the support of a block sparse matrix. Based on the DOA estimation results, multiple UAVs are used to cross-locate marine targets multiple times, and an accurate marine target position is achieved in the SAGIN environment. Numerical results are carried out, which demonstrates the effectiveness of the proposed DOA estimator, and the multi-UAV cooperative localization system can realize accurate target localization.  © 2014 IEEE.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85103188948&doi=10.1109%2fJIOT.2021.3066504&partnerID=40&md5=dd3662764c26c189f444ae332ed4f8db,IEEE Internet of Things Journal,2022
Accelerating Monte Carlo Bayesian Prediction via Approximating Predictive Uncertainty Over the Simplex,"Estimating the predictive uncertainty of a Bayesian learning model is critical in various decision-making problems, e.g., reinforcement learning, detecting the adversarial attack, self-driving car. As the model posterior is almost always intractable, most efforts were made on finding an accurate approximation to the true posterior. Even though a decent estimation of the model posterior is obtained, another approximation is required to compute the predictive distribution over the desired output. A common accurate solution is to use Monte Carlo (MC) integration. However, it needs to maintain a large number of samples, and evaluate the model repeatedly, and average multiple model outputs. In many real-world cases, this is computationally prohibitive. In this work, assuming that the exact posterior or a decent approximation is obtained, we propose a generic framework to approximate the output probability distribution induced by the model posterior with a parameterized model and in an amortized fashion. The aim is to approximate the predictive uncertainty of a specific Bayesian model, meanwhile alleviating the heavy workload of MC integration at testing time. The proposed method is universally applicable to Bayesian classification models that allow for posterior sampling. Theoretically, we show that the idea of amortization incurs no additional costs on approximation performance. Empirical results validate the strong practical performance of our approach.  © 2012 IEEE.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85098798288&doi=10.1109%2fTNNLS.2020.3042525&partnerID=40&md5=21ed3fd46a74eb0e2aafc4fe4156bf20,IEEE Transactions on Neural Networks and Learning Systems,2022
Reconfigurable Intelligent Surface Assisted Multi-Carrier Wireless Systems for Doubly Selective High-Mobility Ricean Channels,"Reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (RIS) constitute a revolutionary technique of beneficially reconfiguring the smart radio environment. However, despite the fact that wireless propagation is of time-varying nature, most of the existing RIS contributions focus on time-invariant scenarios for the following reasons. Firstly, it becomes impractical to instantaneously feed back the control signal based on the doubly selective non-line-of-sight (NLoS) fading scenario. Secondly, channel estimation conceived for the high-mobility and high-dimensional RIS-assisted links has to take into account the spatial-domain (SD), time-domain (TD), and frequency-domain (FD) correlations imposed by the angle-of-arrival/departure (AoA/AoD), the Doppler and the orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing (OFDM) operations, respectively, where none of the existing solutions can be directly applied. Thirdly, it is far from trivial to maximize the NLoS channel powers on all subcarriers by a common set of RIS reflecting coefficients. Fourthly, in the face of double selectivity, it becomes inevitable to encounter either inter-symbol interference (ISI) or inter-channel interference (ICI) during the signal detection in the TD or in the FD, respectively. Against this background, firstly, we focus our attention on line-of-sight (LoS) dominated unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) scenarios. Secondly, we conceive new minimum mean squared error (MMSE) channel estimation methods for doubly selective fading, which perodically transmit pilot symbols embedded into the TD and FD over the SD in order to beneficially exploit the correlations in the three domains. Thirdly, the RIS coefficients are optimized by a low-complexity algorithm based on the LoS representation of the end-to-end system model. Fourthly, tailor-made interference cancallation techniques are devised for improving the signal detection both in the FD and in the TD. Our simulation results are examined in six frequency bands licensed in 5 G, which confirms that the employment of RIS is capable of achieving substantial performance improvements.  © 1967-2012 IEEE.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85124214219&doi=10.1109%2fTVT.2022.3147859&partnerID=40&md5=db1edef57e3330db13c1aa88bc26a850,IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology,2022
Self-Supervised Depth and Ego-Motion Estimation for Monocular Thermal Video Using Multi-Spectral Consistency Loss,"A thermal camera can robustly capture thermal radiation images under harsh light conditions such as night scenes, tunnels, and disaster scenarios. However, despite this advantage, neither depth nor ego-motion estimation research for the thermal camera have not been actively explored so far. In this paper, we propose a self-supervised learning method for depth and ego-motion estimation from thermal images. The proposed method exploits multi-spectral consistency that consists of temperature and photometric consistency loss. The temperature consistency loss provides a fundamental self-supervisory signal by reconstructing clipped and colorized thermal images. Additionally, we design a differentiable forward warping module that can transform the coordinate system of the estimated depth map and relative pose from thermal camera to visible camera. Based on the proposed module, the photometric consistency loss can provide complementary self-supervision to networks. Networks trained with the proposed method robustly estimate the depth and pose from monocular thermal video under low-light and even zero-light conditions. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work to simultaneously estimate both depth and ego-motion from monocular thermal video in a self-supervised manner.  © 2016 IEEE.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85111096032&doi=10.1109%2fLRA.2021.3137895&partnerID=40&md5=161a79d1d364fbc90b08a1aa03dec67f,IEEE Robotics and Automation Letters,2022
Transmissibility-Based Health Monitoring of the Future Connected Autonomous Vehicles Networks,"Transmissibility is a mathematical model that relates a subset of a system's outputs to another subset of outputs of the same system without knowledge of the external excitation or the dynamics of the system. This study investigates fault detection, localization, and mitigation of connected autonomous vehicles (CAV) platoons using transmissibility operators. A CAV platoon is a network of connected autonomous vehicles that communicate together to move in a specific path with the desired velocity. Failure in a physical component of a vehicle, or failure in the form of an internal delay, a cyber-attack, or a communication time-delay affects the safety and security of the CAV platoons. In this paper, we use measurements from sensors available in CAV platoons to identify transmissibility operators, which are used for health monitoring, fault localization, and fault mitigation in the platoon. We first consider the case of vehicle-to-cloud communication (V2C) to monitor the platoon's health. Then, we assume that the platoon loses communication with the cloud, and we monitor the health of the platoon based on vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) communication. We apply the proposed technique to a model of the platoon obtained using the bond graph approach, and an experimental setup consisting of three connected autonomous robots. © 1967-2012 IEEE.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85124819720&doi=10.1109%2fTVT.2022.3151326&partnerID=40&md5=a5f880356f4e234410d34ec16e616e95,IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology,2022
A Fast and Efficient Attitude Control Algorithm of a Tilt-Rotor Aerial Platform Using Inputs Redundancies,"Overactuated multirotor unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) usually consist of multiple tiltable thrust actuators. The controllers are mostly designed by regarding the thrust forces and actuator tilting angles as inputs of outer-loop position and attitude controllers, while formulating an inner-loop controller for each actuator to track the thrust and angle as required by the outer-loop. This hierarchical control strategy separates the complicated combined dynamics into two relatively simple systems, and thus simplifies the control design. However, the interaction between the two systems is neglected and therefore the control performance will be degraded when the inner-loop dynamics are not sufficiently fast. This letter investigates the capability of a new overactuated multirotor UAV configuration, where regular quadcopters are passively hinged onto the frame as tiltable thrust actuators. Apart from the thrust force and tilting angle, each actuator has additional auxiliary torque inputs, which exhibit fast responses as they are not subject to the inner-loop actuator tilting angle dynamics. In this letter, an add-on attitude compensation control is designed exploiting the auxiliary inputs to reduce the tracking and disturbance-rejection errors from the nominal control loop. The effectiveness is demonstrated in simulation and verified by experiment.  © 2016 IEEE.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85122321701&doi=10.1109%2fLRA.2021.3138806&partnerID=40&md5=2bd08adf5840da62e58b21f337fe988a,IEEE Robotics and Automation Letters,2022
RTT-Based Rogue UAV Detection in IoV Networks,"Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) are being used in different emerging domains for accomplishing many critical tasks. However, due to the various constraints, such as battery life, computational resources, etc., a UAV under a mission (M-UAV) often needs assistance from an edge/cloud server that is reachable from the M-UAV's location. A connection between an M-UAV and edge server can be established via an access point or AP. Therefore, before sharing any sensitive information with the edge server, it is essential for an M-UAV to determine the legitimacy of the selected AP. Recently, some works in this direction indicate that a rogue UAV (R-UAV) can successfully mimic a legitimate AP for intercepting the communication channel. Hence, there should be a robust detection mechanism in place for addressing such a threat scenario. In this article, considering one of the emerging domains - the Internet of Vehicle (IoV) networks, at first, we show that communication in the IoV networks can get benefit from the presence of M-UAVs. However, as the link between the M-UAV and edge server can be intercepted by an R-UAV, the adversary may access the sensitive information from the IoV networks. Followed by this, we propose a timing-based algorithm for identifying the presence of rogue APs (or R-UAVs) in the channel. The M-UAV executes the timing-based algorithm, and the detection method does not require any auxiliary hardware or any modification to the network protocols for meeting the objective. Supported by an extensive evaluation study, we show that without any rigid restriction on the M-UAV's speed (e.g., by limiting it to almost static) the proposed approach significantly enhances the detection accuracy (at least by a margin of 29.7% and 16.65%) compared to the state-of-the-art methods.  © 2014 IEEE.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85099563938&doi=10.1109%2fJIOT.2021.3051293&partnerID=40&md5=715288c105fdcf5039ef48b6b92a3589,IEEE Internet of Things Journal,2022
FSNet: A Failure Detection Framework for Semantic Segmentation,"Semantic segmentation is an important task that helps autonomous vehicles understand their surroundings and navigate safely. However, during deployment, even the most mature segmentation models are vulnerable to various external factors that can degrade the segmentation performance with potentially catastrophic consequences for the vehicle and its surroundings. To address this issue, we propose a failure detection framework to identify pixel-level misclassification. We do so by exploiting internal features of the segmentation model and training it simultaneously with a failure detection network.

We evaluate the proposed approach against state-of-the-art methods and achieve 12.30%, 9.46%, and 9.65% performance improvement in the AUPR-Error metric for Cityscapes, BDD100k, and Mapillary semantic segmentation datasets.  © 2016 IEEE.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85123291908&doi=10.1109%2fLRA.2022.3143219&partnerID=40&md5=43493a017ec1c2d66439a83f26c514e0,IEEE Robotics and Automation Letters,2022
Blockchain-Based Cross-Domain Authentication for Intelligent 5G-Enabled Internet of Drones,"While 5G can facilitate high-speed Internet access and make over-the-horizon control a reality for unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs; also known as drones), there are also potential security and privacy considerations, for example, authentication among drones. Centralized authentication approaches not only suffer from a single point of failure but they are also incapable of cross-domain authentication. This complicates the cooperation of drones from different domains. To address these limitations, a blockchain-based cross-domain authentication scheme for intelligent 5G-enabled Internet of drones is proposed in this article. Our approach employs multiple signatures based on threshold sharing to build an identity federation for collaborative domains. This allows us to support domain joining and exiting. Reliable communication between cross-domain devices is achieved by utilizing smart contract for authentication. The session keys are negotiated to secure subsequent communication between two parties. Our security and performance evaluations show that the proposed scheme is resistant to common attacks targeting Internet of Things (IoT) devices (including drones), as well as demonstrating its effectiveness and efficiency.  © 2014 IEEE.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85115169794&doi=10.1109%2fJIOT.2021.3113321&partnerID=40&md5=b5790954d33fcaf30929b8f83c79915e,IEEE Internet of Things Journal,2022
Autonomous Source Term Estimation in Unknown Environments: From a Dual Control Concept to UAV Deployment,"In the gas source search and localisation problem, the use of autonomous robots is of increasing interest due to their deployment speed and lack of human interaction with hazardous materials. This letter presents an aerial robotic platform for performing source term estimation of an unknown chemical release in a challenging a-priori unknown and GPS-denied environment. The proposed system forms the search strategy using the state-of-the-art control concept, dual control for exploitation and exploration, and realises such a function in the aforementioned challenging scenario using an RRT* based path planner. A novel downsampling process on the RRT* is also proposed that addresses the computational infeasibility of calculating the utility of a large number of sample states, whilst still maintaining sample state diversity. The proposed algorithm is tested in a high fidelity simulation environment under a number of configurations, and compared against competing algorithms. The system architecture is also brought forward into a bespoke UAV platform and experimentally tested in real-world conditions. The proposed system is shown to be capable of performing source term estimation robustly and efficiently, which provides a step forward in showing the real world application of previously academic functions. 2377-3766 © 2022 IEEE.

Robust Fuzzy Learning for Partially Overlapping Channels Allocation in UAV Communication Networks,"With significantly dynamic characteristics of the new aerial users, the emerging cellular-enabled unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) communication paradigm raises great challenges to current research of UAV applications. As far as the robust channel allocation is concerned, the high mobility of UAV nodes and the unexpected disturbance of external environment would render most existing methods which rely on definite information and are vulnerable to dynamic environment, become less attractive or even invalid. In this paper, we particularly investigate a cellular-enabled mesh UAV network exploiting partially overlapping channels (POCs), and propose a distributed fuzzy space based learning scheme for POCs allocation to combat the dynamic environment. Rather than the perfect channel state information (CSI) assumption, the dynamic and uncertain CSI of UAVs is characterized by fuzzy number. On this basis, the allocation process can be implemented in a mapped fuzzy space. Integrating fuzzy-logic and game based learning, we formulate the problem of POCs assignment as a fuzzy payoffs game (FPG), and demonstrate the existence of fuzzy Nash equilibrium for our designed FPG. Then, with the derived priority vector in the fuzzy space, the equilibrium solution can be achieved by the proposed algorithm. Numerical simulations demonstrate the advantages of our new scheme.  © 2002-2012 IEEE.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85116189522&doi=10.1109%2fTMC.2020.3023789&partnerID=40&md5=f7cad033650e169b28e76a1f328cb2a0,IEEE Transactions on Mobile Computing,2022
Three-dimensional path planning for autonomous underwater vehicles based on a whale optimization algorithm,"Due to the influence of the complex underwater environment, safety, smoothness, real-time requirements and poor integrity, the path of autonomous underwater vehicles is mainly determined by perception, decision-making and control systems. These not only achieve object detection and environmental investigation but also ensure the safety and reliability of autonomous navigation systems. This paper proposes a whale optimization algorithm based on forward-looking sonar to tackle the three-dimensional path planning of autonomous underwater vehicles. The purpose of path planning is to effectively avoid threatened regions and obtain the shortest and safest paths with minimal fuel and time. The whale optimization algorithm based upon bubble-net hunting behavior imitates the contraction surrounding mechanism, logarithmic spiral position updating mechanism and stochastic searching mechanism to effectively solve the complex problem in the solution space. The whale optimization algorithm not only avoids premature convergence and avoids falling into the local optimum to achieve the global optimal solution but also utilizes exploration and exploitation to enhance the convergence speed and calculation accuracy. To verify the superiority and overall optimization performance of the whale optimization algorithm, the optimization results of the algorithm are compared with other algorithms by minimizing the fitness value. The experimental results reveal that the whale optimization algorithm has better planning efficiency, shorter execution time, faster convergence speed and higher solution precision, which is effective and efficient for path planning. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85126303387&doi=10.1016%2fj.oceaneng.2022.111070&partnerID=40&md5=53a7249b6984659fc6f9fb7527f60ac9,Ocean Engineering,2022
A Reputation-Based Leader Election Scheme for Opportunistic Autonomous Vehicle Platoon,"As an emerging concept in the intelligent transportation system (ITS), Opportunistic Autonomous Vehicle Platoon (OAVP) enables autonomous vehicles to self-organize a temporary platoon and travel together. Whereas, electing the platoon leader is a crucial issue to be solved in this scenario. The platoon leader not only suffers from more wind resistance but also spends more computation resources in dealing with tremendous information obtained from the surrounding environment. Hence, vehicles tend to be a follower rather than a leader. In this paper, we propose a reputation-based leader election system for OAVP named RLE, which contains two sub-systems: leader election and incentive mechanism. In the former one, a reputation-based election scheme is first constructed to elect a relatively trustful leader according to the reputation value recorded on the blockchain. The proposed scheme integrates previous experience with recommendations from other members. In the second sub-system, an incentive mechanism is designed to stimulate platoon members to participate actively in the process of election, which is based on the recorded real-time fuel economy among vehicles participating in a platoon. Security analysis shows that the system is sufficient to deal with potential security threats. Experimental results based on the simulated platform demonstrate the practicality and feasibility of our solution.  © 1967-2012 IEEE.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85113330528&doi=10.1109%2fTVT.2021.3106297&partnerID=40&md5=e6d0ac4f10a3dfca95909554eaa0c064,IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology,2022
Unsupervised Domain Transfer for Task Automation in Unmanned Underwater Vehicle Intervention Operations,"During underwater intervention and monitoring operations, large amounts of imagery and sensory data are produced and stored. Moreover, these data might have the potential to help automatize future operations. In this article, we propose a method for producing segmented data that can be utilized in training of neural networks used for performing desired control tasks. By combining unlabeled images from previous operations with a paired 3-D drawing of the same monitored object, we can train a generative adversarial network to learn the domain adaption between two domains and produce synthetic images with a high resemblance to the original footage. The clear advantage is that the enhanced synthetic images contain the segmented information of the object without the expensive cost of manually segmenting the images. The enhanced segmented data are used to train an object detector that predicts bounding boxes locating the segmented object. This is used in two ways: 1) to analyze the quality of the segmentation and 2) to command a control task for a remotely operated vehicle relative to the object of interest. Controlling the yaw is the main control task to maintain the object centered in the camera frame. Additionally, we explore how overtraining of the domain adaptation network negatively impacts the accuracy of the object detector. This is done by comparing the accuracy of the object detector trained with the datasets produced by different epochs of the domain adaptation network.  © 1976-2012 IEEE.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85123382457&doi=10.1109%2fJOE.2021.3126016&partnerID=40&md5=58b527277dcaaba47a3f78af94b72c7f,IEEE Journal of Oceanic Engineering,2022
Blockchain-Empowered Decentralized Horizontal Federated Learning for 5G-Enabled UAVs,"Motivated by Industry 4.0, 5G-enabled unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs; also known as drones) are widely applied in various industries. However, the open nature of 5G networks threatens the safe sharing of data. In particular, privacy leakage can lead to serious losses for users. As a new machine learning paradigm, federated learning (FL) avoids privacy leakage by allowing data models to be shared instead of raw data. Unfortunately, the traditional FL framework is strongly dependent on a centralized aggregation server, which will cause the system to crash if the server is compromised. Unauthorized participants may launch poisoning attacks, thereby reducing the usability of models. In addition, communication barriers hinder collaboration among a large number of cross-domain devices for learning. To address the abovementioned issues, a blockchain-empowered decentralized horizontal FL framework is proposed. The authentication of cross-domain UAVs is accomplished through multisignature smart contracts. Global model updates are computed by using these smart contracts instead of a centralized server. Extensive experimental results show that the proposed scheme achieves high efficiency of cross-domain authentication and good accuracy.  © 2005-2012 IEEE.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85117762753&doi=10.1109%2fTII.2021.3116132&partnerID=40&md5=832eac4e554c1f8c513ca2488b23f39e,IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics,2022
Joint Optimization of Trajectory and Resource Allocation for Time-Constrained UAV-Enabled Cognitive Radio Networks,"Unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV)-enabled communication has emerged as an irreplaceable technology in military, disaster relief and emergency scenarios. This correspondence investigates the average throughput in a UAV-enabled cognitive radio network, where the UAV is regarded as a dedicated secondary user to enhance the network coverage and spectral efficiency. Based on the probabilistic line-of-sight channel, we exploit the joint design of UAV trajectory and resource allocation to maximize the average throughput under the constraints of co-channel interference and completion time. The original problem is a mixed integer non-convex problem which is generally NP-hard. We first decompose the primal problem into a bilevel programming problem, and then propose an efficient high-quality algorithm based on the particle swarm optimization approach. The optimized trajectory reveals the trade-off between throughput and co-channel interference. Numerical results verify the superiority of the proposed algorithm as compared to other benchmark schemes.  © 1967-2012 IEEE.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85124847877&doi=10.1109%2fTVT.2022.3151671&partnerID=40&md5=dbe574b5865b0ba4b0873beacc7982cd,IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology,2022
Exploring thermal images for object detection in underexposure regions for autonomous driving,"Underexposure regions are vital in constructing a complete perception of the surrounding environment for safe autonomous driving. The availability of thermal cameras has provided an essential alternative to explore regions where other optical sensors lack in capturing interpretable signals. A thermal camera captures an image using the heat difference emitted by objects in the infrared spectrum, and object detection in thermal images becomes effective for autonomous driving in challenging conditions. Although object detection in the visible spectrum domain has matured, thermal object detection lacks effectiveness. A significant challenge is the scarcity of labeled data for the thermal domain, which is essential for SOTA artificial intelligence techniques. This work proposes a domain adaptation framework that employs a style transfer technique for transfer learning from visible spectrum images to thermal images. The framework uses a generative adversarial network (GAN) to transfer the low-level features from the visible spectrum domain to the thermal domain through style consistency. The efficacy of the proposed object detection method in thermal images is evident from the improved results when using styled images from publicly available thermal image datasets (FLIR ADAS and KAIST Multi-Spectral). © 2022 Elsevier B.V.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85127734668&doi=10.1016%2fj.asoc.2022.108793&partnerID=40&md5=066fd82bd5f998a49289e3a03b7eeaed,Applied Soft Computing,2022
Damping behavior analysis for connected automated vehicles with linear car following control,"Connected automated vehicles (CAVs), built upon advanced vehicle control and communication technology, can improve traffic throughput, safety, and energy efficiency. Previous studies on CAVs control focus on instability and stability properties of CAV platoons; however, these analyses cannot reveal the damping platoon oscillation characteristics, which are important for enhancing CAV platoon reliability against variant continuous perturbations. To this end, this research seeks to characterize the damping oscillations of CAVs through exploiting the platoon's unforced oscillatory, i.e., damping behavior. Inspired by the mechanical vibration theory, the proposed approach is applied to a CAV platoon with linear car-following control formulated as Helly's model and the predecessor-following communication topology. The proposed approach is applied to a CAV platoon with the linear car-following control formulated as Helly's model and the predecessor-following communication topology. Numerical analysis results show that a periodic perturbation with the resonance frequency of the CAV platoon will amplify the oscillation and lead to the severest oscillatory traffic. Our analysis highlights the importance of preventing platoon oscillations from resonance in ensuring CAV platooning reliability. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85125662920&doi=10.1016%2fj.trc.2022.103617&partnerID=40&md5=7918503117f27221708f9b7565efd34b,Transportation Research Part C: Emerging Technologies,2022
Development of a Robust Cooperative Adaptive Cruise Control With Dynamic Topology,"This research proposed a robust Cooperative Adaptive Cruise Control (CACC) to overcome the shortcoming of the existing CACC controllers in dealing with unexpected events, such as malware attack, phishing attack, and DNS tunneling attack, where perception and data received via communication contradict with the reality. The proposed controller combines the advantage of two information flow topologies - All-Predecessor Following (APF) and Predecessor-Leader Following (PLF) control methods - to improve the capability of CACC platoons. The string stability of the proposed CACC controller was proven. The robustness to time delay switch (TDS) attacks was assessed using simulation. The normal cruise was simulated to show the capability of the proposed controller in a wide range of speeds. TDS attacks, which encompassed four different unexpected events, were tested to verify the robustness of the proposed CACC. Results confirmed that the proposed CACC controller is string stable and robust against these TDS attacks without crashing or causing jerks. It also showed that the proposed CACC controller outperformed a state-of-the-art CACC controller. © 2000-2011 IEEE.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85099727280&doi=10.1109%2fTITS.2020.3043194&partnerID=40&md5=1a4d4152316fc242b73bd4204f3ad57f,IEEE Transactions on Intelligent Transportation Systems,2022
Age of Information Modeling and Optimization for Fast Information Dissemination in Vehicular Social Networks,"Autonomous vehicles (AVs) with advanced communication, computing, and control capabilities will provide not only a convenient means of transportation but also an emerging platform for real-time social communications and networking. Thereby, it is crucial to enable timely exchange of information over the dynamic cyber-physical-social system enabled by the AVs. In this paper, we consider age of information (AoI)-centric real-time information dissemination over vehicular social networks (VSNs), where the AoI captures the freshness of received data packets. We first propose a mathematical framework based on the mean-field theory (MFT) to analyze the network AoI (NAoI) of VSNs, namely AoI for the AV that lastly receives the information update in the network. The proposed analytical framework considers both the social features of vehicular networks, which are characterized using the scale-free network theory, and the underlying wireless communication process to evaluate the NAoI. Then, we further consider joint optimization of the information update rate at the source node and the transmit probabilities at the AVs for minimization of the average peak NAoI (PNAoI), i.e., the time average of peak values occurred in the evolution of the NAoI, which is solved via a novel parametric optimization scheme. Both analytical and simulation results show that compared with several baseline schemes, the proposed scheme can exploit the scale-free feature of the VSNs to significantly lower the average PNAoI by up to 96%.  © 1967-2012 IEEE.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85126270432&doi=10.1109%2fTVT.2022.3154766&partnerID=40&md5=c39baef53a8596fa111e681e0d8efdfd,IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology,2022

Coordinated Cognitive Risk Control for Bridging Vehicular Radar and Communication Systems,"As an essential part of the emerging Internet of Things, connected and autonomous vehicles (CAVs) have the potential to reshape future transportation systems and change the commute style in people's everyday life. Among many vehicular on-board devices, radar system and vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) communication system are two important pillars for the realization of CAVs.

Autonomous Driving Security: State of the Art and Challenges,"The autonomous driving industry has mushroomed over the past decade. Although autonomous driving has undoubtedly become one of the most promising technologies of this century, its development faces multiple challenges, of which security is the major concern. In this article, we present a thorough analysis of autonomous driving security. First, the attack surface of autonomous driving is presented. After an analysis of the operation of autonomous driving in terms of key components and technologies, the security of autonomous driving is elaborated in four dimensions: 1) sensors; 2) operating system; 3) control system; and 4) vehicle-to-everything (V2X) communication. Sensor security is examined from five components, which are mainly responsible for self-positioning and environmental perception. The analysis of operating system security, the second dimension, is concentrated on the robot operating system. Concerning the control system security, the controller area network is approached mainly from vulnerabilities and protection measures. The fourth dimension, V2X communication security, is probed from four categories of attacks: 1) authenticity/identification; 2) availability; 3) data integrity; and 4) confidentiality with corresponding solutions. Moreover, the drawbacks of existing methods adopted in the four dimensions are also provided. Finally, a conceptual multilayer defense framework is proposed to secure the information flow from external communication to the physical autonomous vehicle.  © 2014 IEEE.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85120043259&doi=10.1109%2fJIOT.2021.3130054&partnerID=40&md5=86f6591b2fdc4292681e6aa517332d9b,IEEE Internet of Things Journal,2022
Adversarial attacks on YOLACT instance segmentation,"Adversarial attacks have stimulated research interests in the field of deep learning security. In terms of autonomous driving technology, instance segmentation can help autonomous vehicles identify a drivable area in a driving environment and a traffic accident will happen once instance segmentation is attacked by adversarial examples. However, only few studies have been done on adversarial attacks about instance segmentation. It would be more meaningful and more practical to research adversarial attacks against instance segmentation. In this paper, we propose the improved Projected Gradient Descent (PGD) to produce adversarial examples on the total loss of You Only Look At CoefficienT (YOLACT) instance segmentation. Firstly, we design the loss function and calculate the adversarial gradient. Then we propose the improved PGD. Finally, we obtain adversarial examples of YOLACT instance segmentation. Our attack method is efficient and powerful in both white-box and black-box attack settings, and is applicable in a variety of neural network architectures. On COCO 2017, under white-box attacks, our method achieves 1.14% box mean average precision (mAP) and 1.50% mask mAP on YOLACT with ResNet101 backbone. We also compare the similarity between clean images and adversarial examples among three different backbones and compare the operation time among three different backbones. We also find that box regression loss, classification loss and mask loss are also effective separately for generating adversarial examples. Our research will provide inspiration for further efforts in efficient and effective defense methods on instance segmentation. © 2022",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85126308556&doi=10.1016%2fj.cose.2022.102682&partnerID=40&md5=15c5c0127eb9595ab9a31d7b727ae7bf,Computers and Security,2022
Adaptive conflict resolution for multi-UAV 4D routes optimization using stochastic fractal search algorithm,"The increasing unmanned aircraft system (UAS) applications in urban environments pose challenges for safe and efficient low altitude air traffic management. As an essential enabler to meet these challenges, pre-flight 4D routes optimization is required to conduct conflict detection and resolution (CD&R) and to generate conflict-free flight routes before departure. Existing studies on strategic deconfliction cover several types of strategies such as scheduling or rerouting. However, a single type of strategy used to solve different types of conflicts may lead to an unsafe and inefficient way of conflict resolution. This paper proposes an adaptive decision-making framework to optimize the resolution strategies used for different types of conflicts with explainable mechanisms. The proposed framework is formulated as a double-layer optimization problem with the considerations of scheduling, speed adjustment, and rerouting strategies for conflict resolution. The first layer of the framework is established as a probabilistic selection model to make decisions on which strategy should be selected for what type of conflict. The second layer is developed as a mixed-integer nonlinear programming (MINLP) model to optimize the decision variables of the strategies selected by the first layer. To solve the proposed double-layer optimization problem, we introduce and improve a novel meta-heuristic stochastic fractal search (SFS) algorithm with two major improvements of a penalty-guided fitness function and an exploitation-exploration balancing scheme. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed adaptive conflict resolution framework successfully optimizes the strategies used for each type of flight conflict, which subsequently optimizes the 4D routes with significant reductions in total operational cost, number of flight conflicts, and flight delays. The improved stochastic fractal search (ISFS) algorithm is also proved effective and reliable in solving the proposed optimization problem in different traffic density scenarios. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85128999875&doi=10.1016%2fj.trc.2022.103666&partnerID=40&md5=e1e81a14ceb6de7ca40ca280f116aa47,Transportation Research Part C: Emerging Technologies,2022
Event-Triggered Adaptive Formation Keeping and Interception Scheme for Autonomous Surface Vehicles Under Malicious Attacks,"In leader-following formation, the leader plays a central role and is more vulnerable to malicious attacks. To effectively protect the leader, this article investigates an event-based formation control problem of autonomous surface vehicles (ASVs) with multiple attackers and actuator failure. A novel adaptive formation keeping and interception scheme is developed for ASVs. In this scheme, a formation keeping controller and an interception controller are designed under a unified framework by sharing same event-triggered mechanism and fault-tolerant structure. To bridge these two controllers, a degree and distance driven formation interception (D3FI) strategy is designed by generating defenders. It is shown that with the proposed scheme, all attackers are intercepted without affecting formation keeping of remaining ASVs if the original topology is connected. Advantages of our scheme are: 1) stable controller switching is ensured during the formation cooperation and 2) the fault-tolerance is obtained with lower actuator updating frequencies and least number of adaptive parameters for each ASV.  © 2005-2012 IEEE.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85114733403&doi=10.1109%2fTII.2021.3111219&partnerID=40&md5=b07be396547648e42e1ed2e6381aa224,IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics,2022
Self-supervised learning of monocular depth using quantized networks,"Learning monocular depth in a self-supervised manner is desirable for numerous applications ranging from autonomous driving, robotics to augmented reality. However, the current challenges lie in the problems of scale ambiguity, dynamic scene and hardware limitations. To this end, a self-supervised approach is proposed in this work for monocular depth learning and estimation. Specifically, we first introduce a self-supervised depth learning framework that learns a part of the camera intrinsics and the stereo extrinsics, which ensures the absoluteness of the predicted depth while achieving enhanced performance (i.e., lower error between the predicted depth and the ground-truth) on depth estimation. Besides, we further improve the accuracy and the efficiency (i.e., shorter inference time and lower weight/activation footprints) via a specially-designed network that exploits multi-scale context across multi-level feature maps. In addition, we propose a quantization scheme for our depth estimation networks. The scheme allows the network inference to be carried out using INT4-INT8 arithmetic while keeping a high performance on depth estimation. Extensive experiments on KITTI and Make3D datasets demonstrate that our approach substantially boosts the performance compared to the existing state-of-the-art methods on monocular depth estimation. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85121371058&doi=10.1016%2fj.neucom.2021.11.071&partnerID=40&md5=62eb7f5e447c3f92f15edd603ecea030,Neurocomputing,2022
Incremental fault-tolerant control for a hybrid quad-plane UAV subjected to a complete rotor loss,"Quad-plane is a popular type of electric vertical and takeoff/landing (eVTOL) vehicle that hybridizes a quadrotor and a fixed-wing airplane. However, the mechanical simplicity of a quad-plane also makes it vulnerable to rotor failures. When a complete rotor fails, it becomes physically impossible to stop the quad-plane from fast yaw spinning, which further induces considerable abnormal aerodynamic forces and moments on the wing. In this paper, a novel incremental adaptive sliding mode control (I-ASMC) is proposed to address these challenges. First, by exploiting sensor measurements, it simultaneously reduces the control model dependency and the minimum possible sliding mode control/observer gains. Second, finite-time convergence is guaranteed in the Lyapunov sense. Third, the control gains are automatically adapted to their minimum possible values without prior-knowledge on the uncertainty bounds. The proposed I-ASMC method is verified on a high fidelity simulation platform with computational fluid dynamic (CFD) aerodynamic models. Simulation results demonstrate that I-ASMC can drive a quad-plane with a complete loss of a single rotor to follow a trajectory. Its robustness to aerodynamic model uncertainties and rotor faults is also better than the linear quadratic regulator (LQR) and the incremental nonlinear dynamic inversion (INDI) control. In conclusion, the reduced model dependency, implementation simplicity, and improved robustness make the proposed I-ASMC promising for enhancing quad-plane safety in real life. © 2021 The Author(s)",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85115365794&doi=10.1016%2fj.ast.2021.107105&partnerID=40&md5=7d9e3629ebb96834b19aba3b43468b05,Aerospace Science and Technology,2022
Energy-Saving Deployment Optimization and Resource Management for UAV-Assisted Wireless Sensor Networks With NOMA,"Energy-saving techniques are vital for the battery-powered sensor devices (SDs), which affect their lifetime. In this paper, we propose an air-and-ground cooperative wireless sensor network (AGWSN), wherein several UAVs are deployed as aerial access points (AAPs) to assist the terrestrial access point (TAP) for data collecting. The positions of the AAPs can be modified to approach the cell-edge SDs, therefore reducing the energy of the SDs expended in uploading data. To fully exploit the potential of the AGWSN, we formulate a joint AAP position optimization, channel allocation, and power control problem to minimize the total power consumption of all SDs subject to their decoding threshold. To solve the formulated problem, we first analyze the optimal user pairing rule in each cell and based on the rule propose a maximum-weighted-independent-set inspired algorithm for the AAP position optimization. Then, we remodel the channel allocation problem as an interference minimization problem and devise a K-CUT based algorithm to solve it. We further propose a low-complex iterative algorithm to obtain the optimal transmission power for each SD. The performance of the proposed algorithms is evaluated via theoretical analysis and numerical simulation. Simulation results indicate that if the intracell and intercell interference are not well coordinated, the superiorities of the AGWSN cannot be developed, and its performance is even worse than the traditional terrestrial network (TTN). Cooperated with our algorithms, the AGWSN significantly outperforms the TTN in terms of total power consumption and probability of successful decoding. © 1967-2012 IEEE.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85126517426&doi=10.1109%2fTVT.2022.3159681&partnerID=40&md5=40d676ff425cb785a26c326b8f0e1c90,IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology,2022
DarkSky: Privacy-preserving target tracking strategies using a flying drone,"Commercially well-known drones, unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), are increasingly popular with the public and have been widely deployed in diverse applications. However, a drone equipped with tracking, monitoring, or sensing device(s) can illegally collect privacy- and security-sensitive information and intrude restricted areas. Thus, recent literature focuses on the protection of users and restricted areas from an unwanted privacy attack and intrusion caused by the drone. Unlike prior research, however, we fundamentally shift the privacy paradigm from protecting users and restricted areas from a malicious drone into protecting and hiding the sensitive information of a drone from an adversary. In light of these, we propose three privacy-preserving target tracking strategies based on the shortest path, random locations, and dummy locations. The basic idea is to obfuscate the current location of the drone and randomize the trajectory to prevent the adversary from locating and tracking the drone. We also analyze drone privacy in terms of location and trajectory and measure them through entropy-based anonymity, the size of convex-hull, and the number of paths. We conduct extensive simulation experiments using the OMNeT++ for performance evaluation and comparison with stationary and moving target tracking scenarios under three mobility models. The simulation results indicate that the proposed strategies can be a viable approach to track the target while reserving a certain level of location and trajectory privacy. © 2022 Elsevier Inc.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85124873844&doi=10.1016%2fj.vehcom.2022.100459&partnerID=40&md5=548a747ae18221ef22300093a790e2bd,Vehicular Communications,2022
Game Theoretic Physical Layer Authentication for Spoofing Detection in UAV Communications,"In this paper, we propose a game theoretic framework for secure physical layer authentication (PLA) by applying the spatial correlations of received signal strength (RSS) in the air-to-ground channels between an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV), a legitimate transmitter, and a spoofer. Based on our hypothesis model, we first derive the false alarm rate and miss detection rate for the UAV receiver. We then formulate a zero-sum PLA game where the UAV receiver selects its RSS detection threshold while the spoofer selects its attack probability to maximize their respective utilities. We derive the Nash equilibrium (NE) and its existence condition for the proposed PLA game. Monte Carlo simulation results accurately verify our analytical expressions for the false alarm rate and miss detection rate. Numerical results highlight the complex interplay between the detection threshold, spoofing attack probability and UAV altitude in the derived NE.  © 1967-2012 IEEE.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85127060841&doi=10.1109%2fTVT.2022.3161006&partnerID=40&md5=e76576ac18fd06de7b79ea4531f50e11,IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology,2022
Gaze Preserving CycleGANs for Eyeglass Removal and Persistent Gaze Estimation,"A driver's gaze is critical for determining theirattention, state, situational awareness, and readiness to take over control from partially automated vehicles. Estimating the gaze direction is the most obvious way to gauge a driver's state under ideal conditions when limited to using non-intrusive imaging sensors. Unfortunately, the vehicular environment introduces a variety of challenges that are usually unaccounted for - harsh illumination, nighttime conditions, and reflective eyeglasses. Relying on head pose alone under such conditions can prove to be unreliable and erroneous. In this study, we offer solutions to address these problems encountered in the real world. To solve issues with lighting, we demonstrate that using an infrared camera with suitable equalization and normalization suffices. To handle eyeglasses and their corresponding artifacts, we adopt image-to-image translation using generative adversarial networks to pre-process images prior to gaze estimation. Our proposed Gaze Preserving CycleGAN (GPCycleGAN) is trained to preserve the driver's gaze while removing potential eyeglasses from face images. GPCycleGAN is based on the well-known CycleGAN approach - with the addition of a gaze classifier and a gaze consistency loss for additional supervision. Our approach exhibits improved performance, interpretability, robustness and superior qualitative results on challenging real-world datasets. © 2016 IEEE.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85123345666&doi=10.1109%2fTIV.2022.3144043&partnerID=40&md5=da18ccb0a6d59eb613d5f1ebdac15d61,IEEE Transactions on Intelligent Vehicles,2022
SHOTS: Scalable Secure Authentication-Attestation Protocol Using Optimal Trajectory in UAV Swarms,"Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) have enabled a broad spectrum of applications serving social, commercial, and military purposes. However, since UAVs use wireless communication technologies, they are highly vulnerable to security threats. Establishing trust with the base station is the most fundamental security aspect in UAV networks to mitigate these threats. However, due to a UAV's constrained resources, deploying traditional trust establishment schemes in UAV networks becomes challenging. Further, this issue escalates as the number of UAVs increases. To address this issue, we propose an authentication cum attestation protocol for UAV swarms using an optimal communication trajectory, which can establish the required trust in a lightweight manner. Furthermore, our protocol uses Physical Unclonable Functions (PUFs) and thus guarantees physical security as well. We demonstrate that the proposed protocol is feasible, scalable, and secure using a formal Mao Boyd logic approach. Comparative analyses show that the proposed protocol outperforms the state-of-the-art.  © 1967-2012 IEEE.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85127460096&doi=10.1109%2fTVT.2022.3162226&partnerID=40&md5=4efcf2b47a0f003a884e77fdf71ed397,IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology,2022
LBSV: Lightweight Blockchain Security Protocol for Secure Storage and Communication in SDN-Enabled IoV,"The development of modern software-defined networking (SDN) solutions brings new opportunities in Internet-of-Vehicles (IoVs). However, the autonomous nature of the vehicular environment leads to unpredictable security vulnerabilities and reliability issues. The high computation overhead and storage requirements also pose a significant challenge in message dissemination. To overcome these issues, we introduce a lightweight blockchain-based security protocol for secure communication and storage in SDN-enabled IoV, known as LBSV. The LBSV is a permissioned blockchain network that uses the proposed modified practical byzantine fault tolerance (mPBFT) consensus algorithm. Additionally, the SDN-enabled network exploits the blockchain framework and schedules different procedures. The secure message dissemination is achieved through various cryptographic functions (i.e., elliptic curve cryptography (ECC) and the secure hash algorithm (SHA256)). The security analysis shows that the LBSV withstands various cyberattacks regarding message dissemination privacy. The experimental results show that LBSV provides high performance with 85% less computational cost, 55% less storage and communication overhead and 90% less consensus delay compared with state-of-the-art schemes.  © 1967-2012 IEEE.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85127795995&doi=10.1109%2fTVT.2022.3163960&partnerID=40&md5=e73759b1741670a53e7475ca969507ae,IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology,2022
Reachability Analysis of Cyber-Physical Systems Under Stealthy Attacks,"This article studies the reachable set of cyber-physical systems subject to stealthy attacks with the Kullback-Leibler divergence adopted to describe the stealthiness. The reachable set is defined as the set in which both the system state and the estimation error of the Kalman filter reside with a certain probability. The necessary and sufficient conditions of the reachable set being unbounded are given for the finite and infinite time cases, respectively. When the reachable set is bounded, an ellipsoidal outer approximation is obtained by solving a convex optimization problem. An application of this approximation to the safety evaluation is also given. A numerical simulation of an unmanned ground vehicle is presented to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach.  © 2013 IEEE.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85124635647&doi=10.1109%2fTCYB.2020.3025307&partnerID=40&md5=86ab11c28bf4166584c837df826ccfe6,IEEE Transactions on Cybernetics,2022
Aerial-Terrestrial Network NOMA for Cellular-Connected UAVs,"Efficient connectivity in cellular-connected unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV)s is limited by scarcity of the radio spectrum and strong inter-cell interference (ICI). To address these issues, we propose an aerial-terrestrial network non-orthogonal multiple access (ATN-NOMA) scheme. In this proposed scheme, we pair the aerial user (AU) and terrestrial user (TU) in a NOMA setting to leverage their asymmetric channel gains and rate demands in downlink communications. In ATN-NOMA, the strong ICI issue at the AU receiver is further managed by an elevation-angle based user association, equipping the AU with an adjustable beamwidth directional antenna, and forming a beamforming among the coordinated terrestrial base stations (BS)s. We then obtain the optimal beamwidth and suboptimal power allocation so that the TUs' sum-rate is maximized subject to the AU's Quality-of-Service (QoS) requirement. The corresponding optimization problem is non-convex in which we exploit the structure of the problem and apply successive convex approximation (SCA) to obtain a suboptimal solution. We then derive the statistical properties, which consequently enable us to estimate the aggregated ICI. In cases where no interfering BSs have the same elevation angle as the coordinated BSs, we further approximate the AU's outage probability. We then compare the TUs' sum-rate and the outage probability of the ATN-NOMA with multiple existing schemes. Extensive simulation results show that our proposed ATN-NOMA scheme outperforms existing schemes by 52-91% in terms of the sum-rate, and its analytical outage probability can be as low as the order of 10-17. Furthermore, we show that the pairing of AU and TU in multi-cell networks remains beneficial, subject to effective mitigation of ICI.  © 1967-2012 IEEE.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85127749291&doi=10.1109%2fTVT.2022.3165380&partnerID=40&md5=d90b31aa21e74d9418cefc2c138c7389,IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology,2022
Tightly-Coupled Fusion of VINS and Motion Constraint for Autonomous Vehicle,"In this paper, we develop a novel visual-inertial navigation system with motion constraint (VINS-Motion), which extends the visual-inertial navigation system (VINS) to incorporate vehicle motion information for improving the autonomous vehicles localization accuracy. We introduce the vehicle stop detection module in the pre-processing measurement procedure. During the back-end processing, if the vehicle is detected to be in a stopping state, we perform optimization based on the stop constraint to help eliminate the abnormal jitter of the estimated pose, thus ensuring the reasonability of the trajectory. Otherwise, besides the prior information, IMU measurement residual, and visual measurement residual utilized in VINS, vehicle orientation/velocity constraint built by Ackerman steering model is first exploited to constitute residuals. We minimize the sum of priors and Mahalanobis norms of three kinds of residuals to obtain a maximum posterior estimation, thus increasing system consistency and accuracy. The proposed approach is validated on public datasets and compared with state-of-the-art algorithms, which demonstrates that the motion constraint proposed in this paper improves the standard VINS performance and achieves significantly higher positioning accuracy.  © 1967-2012 IEEE.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85133764912&doi=10.1109%2fTVT.2022.3162155&partnerID=40&md5=0fbd3d8134b545c4ef274a10d3c03e14,IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology,2022
Saliency Heat-Map as Visual Attention for Autonomous Driving Using Generative Adversarial Network (GAN),"The ability to sense and understanding the driving environment is a key technology for ADAS and autonomous driving. Human drivers have to pay more visual attention to important or target elements and ignore unnecessary ones present in their field of sight. A model that computes this visual attention of targets in a specific driving environment is essential and useful in supporting autonomous driving, object-specific tracking & detection, driving training, car collision warning, traffic sign detection, etc. In this paper, we propose a new framework of visual attention that can predict important objects in the driving scene using a conditional generative adversarial network. A large scale Visual Attention Driving Database (VADD) of saliency heat-maps is built from existing driving datasets using a saliency mechanism. The proposed framework model takes its strength from these saliency heat-maps as conditioning label variables. The results show that the proposed approach makes us able to predict heat-maps of most important objects in a driving environment.  © 2000-2011 IEEE.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85100852233&doi=10.1109%2fTITS.2021.3053178&partnerID=40&md5=4ddd59e8daf5786c3b23d6cfe7716e97,IEEE Transactions on Intelligent Transportation Systems,2022
A Lightweight and Privacy-Preserving Mutual Authentication and Key Agreement Protocol for Internet of Drones Environment,"With accelerated advances in various technologies, drones, better known as unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), are increasingly commonplace and consequently have a more pronounced impact on society. For example, Internet of Drones (IoD), a new communication paradigm offering fundamental navigation assistance and access to information, has widespread applications ranging from agricultural drones in farming to surveillance drones in the COVID-19 pandemic. The increasingly prominent role of IoD in our society also reinforces the importance of securing such systems against various data privacy and security threats. Operationally, it can be challenging to adopt conventional off-the-shelf security products in an IoD system due to the underpinning characteristics of drones (e.g., dynamic and open communication channel). Therefore in this article, we propose a lightweight and privacy-preserving mutual authentication and key agreement protocol, hereafter referred to as PMAP. The latter uses a physical unclonable function (PUF) and chaotic system to support mutual authentication and establish a secure session key between communication entities in the IoD system. To be specific, PMAP consists of two schemes, namely: 1) ${\mathrm{ PMAP}}^{D2Z}$ (that mutually authenticates drone and zone service provider (ZSP) and establishes secure session keys) and 2) ${\mathrm{ PMAP}}^{D2D}$ (that mutually authenticates drones and establishes secure session keys). In addition, PMAP supports conditional privacy preserving so that the genuine identity of drones can only be revealed by trusted ZSPs. We evaluate the security of PMAP using automated validation of Internet security protocols and application (AVISPA), as well as provide formal and informal security analysis to show the resilience of PMAP against various security attacks. We also evaluate the performance of PMAP through extensive experiments and compare its performance with existing AKA and IBE-Lite schemes, whose findings show that PMAP achieves better performance in terms of computation cost, energy consumption, and communication overhead. © 2014 IEEE.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85127502616&doi=10.1109%2fJIOT.2022.3163367&partnerID=40&md5=1a4561e4935bff9d2a64ce1432d2efe2,IEEE Internet of Things Journal,2022
On reliability assessment of ship machinery system in different autonomy degree; A Bayesian-based approach,"Analyzing the reliability of autonomous ships has recently attracted attention mainly due to epistemic uncertainty (lack of knowledge) integrated with automatic operations in the maritime sector. The advent of new random failures with unrecognized failure patterns in autonomous ship operations requires a comprehensive reliability assessment specifically aiming at estimating the time in which the ship can be trusted to be left unattended. While the reliability concept is touched upon well through the literature, the operational trustworthiness needs more elaboration to be established for system safety, especially within the maritime sector. Accordingly, in this paper, a probabilistic approach has been established to estimate the trusted operational time of the ship machinery system through different autonomy degrees. The uncertainty associated with ship operation has been quantified using Markov Chain Monte-Carlo simulation from likelihood function in Bayesian inference. To verify the developed framework, a practical example of a machinery plant used in typical short sea merchant ships is taken into account. This study can be exploited by asset managers to estimate the time in which the ship can be left unattended.

Energy-Efficient and Secure Communication Toward UAV Networks,"Wireless networks ensure the unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) communicate and cooperate with each other, which plays an indispensable role among UAVs. The two crucial challenges in UAV wireless networks are energy saving and security. The current lightweight communication approaches lead to insufficient robustness of the encrypted transmission that is insecure. To address this issue, we propose a secure transmission approach with energy efficiency toward UAVs networks. We design a lightweight symmetric encryption algorithm based on SM4 and the relevant key negotiation and update mechanism to protect the confidentiality of communication contents. Moreover, a modified aggregative BLS signature scheme, together with the Merkle Hash tree (MHT), is introduced to guarantee the integrity and authenticity of data packets in transmission. Furthermore, we propose an online/offline revocable identity-based group signature (OORIBGS) scheme and integrate it into our framework for UAV anonymity, traceability, as well as revocability with small key management cost and high efficiency. We give detailed security analysis and prove that our proposal has the properties of data confidentiality, integrity, and authenticity, as well as identity traceability and anonymity. Moreover, we apply our approach in the UAVs networks and evaluate the runtime and anti-attack performance. The experimental results show that the proposed method can be effectively used in UAVs secure communication.  © 2014 IEEE.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85119596149&doi=10.1109%2fJIOT.2021.3118079&partnerID=40&md5=f6406346a823869b5b54232c278bd07d,IEEE Internet of Things Journal,2022
Modified continuous Ant Colony Optimisation for multiple Unmanned Ground Vehicle path planning,"Path planning for multiple Unmanned Ground Vehicles (UGVs) is a critical problem for UGV autonomy and is increasingly attracting attention due to its wide applications. This paper presents a continuous ant colony-based multi-UGV path planner, which consists of UGV path planning and multi-UGV coordination. A continuous Ant Colony Optimisation with a Probability-based random-walk strategy and an Adaptive waypoints-repair method (ACOPAR) is proposed to optimise the path for each UGV. Collision avoidance among the UGVs for the multi-agent coordination problem is then resolved via a velocity shifting optimisation algorithm. In ACOPAR, exploration and exploitation are balanced using a probability-based random-walk strategy switching between a Brownian and a Cauchy motion to modify the construction process of new solutions. An adaptive waypoints-repair strategy and a re-initialisation strategy are designed to improve the algorithm's performance in finding feasible paths. A test suite of multi-UGV path planning with 12 cases is proposed to evaluate the search capability and scalability of the proposed ACOPAR compared to other algorithms. Experimental results validate the superiority of ACOPAR, especially when solving complex, high-dimensional problems. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85126002084&doi=10.1016%2fj.eswa.2022.116605&partnerID=40&md5=4d18065d597fa9f6c266fe130555739f,Expert Systems with Applications,2022
Semantic-Direct Visual Odometry,"Traditional direct SLAM methods formulate the camera pose and map estimation as minimization of the photometric error, which is tackled by the Gauss-Newton algorithm or the Levenberg-Marquardt algorithm in the optimization. However, the convexity of the photometric error only holds in a small region due to the characteristics of the convexity for grayscale images. Thus, the system may be stuck in sub-optimal local minima when tracking points have large displacement. Unlike grayscale images, the semantic probabilities omit the details inside the semantic objects while mainly reforming on the boundary of semantic objects, which has better convexity for large displacement. In this letter, we propose a novel semantic-direct visual odometry (SDVO), exploiting the direct alignment of semantic probabilities. By constructing the joint error function based on grayscale images and semantic probabilities, the joint error function achieves better convexity contrary to the photometric error. Consequently, the proposed system moves towards optima with steady steps in the optimization iterations. Experimental results on the challenging real-world dataset demonstrate a significant improvement over the baseline by integrating the direct alignment of semantic probabilities.  © 2016 IEEE.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85130804250&doi=10.1109%2fLRA.2022.3176799&partnerID=40&md5=6e5c15c6ecfe4023499f66a9f914d260,IEEE Robotics and Automation Letters,2022

Guaranteed Collision-Free Reference Tracking in Constrained Multi Unmanned Vehicle Systems,"In this article, we face the reference tracking control problem for a system of heterogeneous multiple unmanned vehicles (MUVs) moving in a 2-D planar environment. We consider a scenario, where each vehicle follows a trajectory imposed by a local planner and where each unmanned vehicle can have different linear dynamics as well as different constraints and disturbances. In this contest, we design a novel control architecture, where a centralized traffic manager, in conjunction with ad-hoc designed local vehicle controllers, is capable of ensuring the absence of collisions. The proposed solution is obtained by exploiting, for the local vehicles' controllers, a dual-mode model-predictive controller and, for the traffic manager, set-theoretic and controllability properties. Moreover, after modeling the potential vehicle collisions with a graph, connectivity arguments are used to obtain an optimal collision resolution, which minimizes the number of vehicles that need to be stopped. The resulting control scheme ensures collision-free signal tracking. Results of the simulation conducted on an MUV system are shown to provide tangible evidence of the features of the proposed framework.  © 1963-2012 IEEE.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85112184668&doi=10.1109%2fTAC.2021.3093280&partnerID=40&md5=0b3e7c9876cebe6cc506348558ffc9c0,IEEE Transactions on Automatic Control,2022
"FALCON: A Networked Drone System for Sensing, Localizing, and Approaching RF Targets","We present FALCON, a novel autonomous drone network system for sensing, localizing, and approaching RF targets/sources such as smartphone devices. Potential applications of our system include disaster relief missions in which networked drones sense the Wi-Fi signal emitted from a victim's smartphone and dynamically navigate to accurately localize and quickly approach the victim, for instance, to deliver the time-critical first-aid kits. For that we exploit Wi-Fi's recent fine time measurement (FTM) protocol to realize the first on-drone FTM sensor network that enables accurate and dynamic ranging of targets in a mission. We propose a flight planning strategy that adapts the trajectory of the drones to concurrently favor localizing and approaching the target. Namely, our approach jointly optimizes the drones' diversity of observations and the target approaching process, while flexibly trading off the intensities of the potentially conflicting objectives.

Byzantine-Resilient Distributed Hypothesis Testing With Time-Varying Network Topology,"In this article, we study the problem of distributed hypothesis testing over a network of mobile agents with limited communication and sensing ranges to infer the true hypothesis collaboratively. In particular, we consider a scenario where there is an unknown subset of compromised agents that may deliberately share altered information to undermine the team objective. We propose two distributed algorithms where each agent maintains and updates two sets of beliefs (i.e., probability distributions over the hypotheses), namely local and actual beliefs (LB and AB, respectively, for brevity). In both algorithms, at every time step, each agent shares its AB with other agents within its communication range and makes a local observation to update its LB. Then, both algorithms can use the shared information to update ABs under certain conditions. One requires receiving a certain number of shared ABs at each time instant; the other accumulates shared ABs over time and updates after the number of shared ABs exceeds a prescribed threshold. Otherwise, both algorithms rely on the agent's current LB and AB to update the new AB. We prove under mild assumptions that the AB for every noncompromised agent converges almost surely to the true hypothesis, without requiring connectivity in the underlying time-varying network topology. Using a simulation of a team of unmanned aerial vehicles aiming to classify adversarial agents among themselves, we illustrate and compare the proposed algorithms. Finally, we show experimentally that the second algorithm consistently outperforms the first algorithm in terms of the speed of convergence.  © 1963-2012 IEEE.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85133699611&doi=10.1109%2fTAC.2021.3102474&partnerID=40&md5=693d70fbcda2bac77127149396744212,IEEE Transactions on Automatic Control,2022
MD-GAN-Based UAV Trajectory and Power Optimization for Cognitive Covert Communications,"This article investigates the covert performance of an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) jammer-assisted cognitive radio (CR) network. In particular, the covert transmission of secondary users can be effectively protected by UAV jamming against the eavesdropping. For practical consideration, the UAV is assumed to only know certain partial channel distribution information (CDI), whereas not to know the detection threshold of an eavesdropper. For this sake, we propose a model-driven generative adversarial network (MD-GAN)-assisted optimization framework, consisting of a generator and a discriminator, where the unknown channel information and the detection threshold are learned weights. Then, a GAN-based joint trajectory and power optimization (GAN-JTP) algorithm is developed to train the MD-GAN optimization framework for covert communication, which results in the joint solution of the UAV's trajectory and transmits power to maximize the covert rate and the probability of detection errors.

Unfortunately, despite impressive advantages for drivers, these functions also have various vulnerabilities that could lead to cyber-physical attacks on automotive Controller Area Networks (i.e., automotive CAN). To deal with these security issues, a multitude of issue-specific countermeasures have already been proposed. In this paper, we introduce existing research on automotive CAN attacks and evaluate several state-of-the-art countermeasures. Particularly, we provide a comprehensive adversary model for automotive CAN and classify existing countermeasures into four system categories: (1) preventative protection, (2) intrusion detection, (3) authentication, and (4) post-protection. From the extensive literature review, we attempt to summarize the security research regarding automotive CAN and identify open research directions for in-vehicle networks of autonomous vehicle.  © 2000-2011 IEEE.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85107199736&doi=10.1109%2fTITS.2021.3078740&partnerID=40&md5=82e570b8a6b66ae1b198b78027666f8e,IEEE Transactions on Intelligent Transportation Systems,2022
RFAP: A Revocable Fine-Grained Access Control Mechanism for Autonomous Vehicle Platoon,"Autonomous Vehicle Platoon (AVP) is conceived as a promising solution to enhance the traffic capacity and reduce the energy consumption in the intelligent transportation system. Nevertheless, AVP without security guarantees are prone to various attacks, which probably lead to life-threatening accidents. Motivated by solving this issue, an outsourced attribute-based access control mechanism with direct revocation for AVP (RFAP) is introduced in this paper. Among them, attribute-based encryption is utilized to implement fine-grained access control during the encryption process. Furthermore, RFAP can not only realize the immediate revocation of platoon member who is about to leave the platoon without affecting others, but also achieve secure outsourced decryption with the help of edge computing units for minimizing the computational overhead of decryption on the vehicle side. Security analysis and simulation results indicate that our RFAP mechanism is practical in aspects of security and efficiency.  © 2000-2011 IEEE.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85114604359&doi=10.1109%2fTITS.2021.3105458&partnerID=40&md5=aa7dba1597b3d7953b6a3a6e3687b251,IEEE Transactions on Intelligent Transportation Systems,2022
Perceptual Enhancement for Autonomous Vehicles: Restoring Visually Degraded Images for Context Prediction via Adversarial Training,"Realizing autonomous vehicles is one of the ultimate dreams for humans. However, perceptual information collected by sensors in dynamic and complicated environments, in particular, vision information, may exhibit various types of degradation. This may lead to mispredictions of context followed by more severe consequences. Thus, it is necessary to improve degraded images before employing them for context prediction. To this end, we propose a generative adversarial network to restore images from common types of degradation. The proposed model features a novel architecture with an inverse and a reverse module to address additional attributes between image styles. With the supplementary information, the decoding for restoration can be more precise. In addition, we develop a loss function to stabilize the adversarial training with better training efficiency for the proposed model. Compared with several state-of-the-art methods, the proposed method can achieve better restoration performance with high efficiency. It is highly reliable for assisting in context prediction in autonomous vehicles. © 2000-2011 IEEE.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85118544615&doi=10.1109%2fTITS.2021.3120075&partnerID=40&md5=fe86aa385b8ec6dd5e93d42934c4e7a2,IEEE Transactions on Intelligent Transportation Systems,2022
On Social Interactions of Merging Behaviors at Highway On-Ramps in Congested Traffic,"Merging at highway on-ramps while interacting with other human-driven vehicles is challenging for autonomous vehicles (AVs). An efficient route to this challenge requires exploring and exploiting knowledge of the interaction process from demonstrations by humans. However, it is unclear what information (or environmental states) is utilized by the human driver to guide their behavior throughout the whole merging process. This paper provides quantitative analysis and evaluation of the merging behavior at highway on-ramps with congested traffic in a volume of time and space. Two types of social interaction scenarios are considered based on the social preferences of surrounding vehicles: courteous and rude. The significant levels of environmental states for characterizing the interactive merging process are empirically analyzed based on the real-world INTERACTION dataset. Experimental results reveal two fundamental mechanisms in the merging process: 1) Human drivers select different states to make sequential decisions at different moments of task execution; and 2) the social preference of surrounding vehicles can impact variable selection for making decisions. It implies that efficient decision-making design should filter out irrelevant information while considering social preference to achieve comparable human-level performance. These essential findings shed light on developing new decision-making approaches for AVs. © 2000-2011 IEEE.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85136126896&doi=10.1109%2fTITS.2021.3102407&partnerID=40&md5=f003c41c144a252c58a174a9640d8049,IEEE Transactions on Intelligent Transportation Systems,2022
Fast Detection of Small Targets in High-Resolution Maritime Radars by Feature Normalization and Fusion,"Joint exploitation of multiple features is a recognized way to implement the effective detection of small targets on the sea in high-resolution maritime radars at the dwelling mode. The tri-feature-based and feature-compression-based detectors use the time-consuming convex hull learning and decision. In this article, a fast feature-fusion-based detector using seven salient features is proposed, where the convex hull learning and decision are replaced by simple threshold determination and decision. It is found that the seven features of sea clutter can be modeled well by the Burr type XII and t-distributions. From the fitted distribution, each feature is normalized to approximate the standard Gaussian distribution by a nonlinear transformation. In the seven-dimensional normalized feature space, an analytical method is given to calculate the optimal weights of feature fusion by the maximization of the interclass distance of the two-class samples. Owing to the normalization of the seven features, the feature fusion loss is significantly reduced comparing with the direct fusion of seven features. The fast feature-fusion-based detector was evaluated on the open and recognized radar databases and offshore experimental data using an unmanned aerial vehicle with a corner reflector. The results show that the fast detector attains competitive performance with the existing best feature-based detector.  © 1976-2012 IEEE.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85126535604&doi=10.1109%2fJOE.2021.3133553&partnerID=40&md5=fd548d716ad771e79ea1aa53a5b284cf,IEEE Journal of Oceanic Engineering,2022
Self-Supervised Depth Completion From Direct Visual-LiDAR Odometry in Autonomous Driving,"In this work, a simple yet effective deep neural network is proposed to generate the dense depth map of the scene by exploiting both LiDAR sparse point cloud and the monocular camera image. Specifically, a feature pyramid network is firstly employed to extract feature maps from images across time. Then the relative pose is calculated by minimizing the feature distance between aligned pixels from inter-frame feature maps. Finally, the feature maps and the relative pose are further applied to compute the feature-metric loss for training the depth completion network. The key novelty of this work lies in that a self-supervised mechanism is presented to train the depth completion network by directly using visual-LiDAR odometry between consecutive frames. Comprehensive experiments and ablation studies on benchmark dataset KITTI demonstrate the superior performance over other state-of-the-art methods in terms of pose estimation and depth completion. The detailed performance of the proposed approach (referred to as SelfCompDVLO) can be found on the KITTI depth completion benchmark.

Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV)-Assisted Path Planning for Unmanned Ground Vehicles (UGVs) via Disciplined Convex-Concave Programming,"Thelast decade has witnessed growing research interests in the path-planning problem for unmanned ground vehicles (UGVs) equipped with RGB-D cameras or LiDARs. However, apart from their extremely high cost, these sensors may be obscured by obstacles, which makes them impractical for many complex scenarios. Besides, most of the existing works for path planning have not considered energy efficiency for UGVs that are usually constrained by limited on-board batteries. Distinct from existing methods, this work presents a vision-based unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV)-assisted cooperative system for multiple UGVs. The proposed system harnesses the broad vision of UAV and operates in both general outdoor and global positioning system (GPS)-denied indoor environments. In sharp contrast to the conventional heuristic algorithms such as the rapidly exploring random tree (RRT) algorithm and the Dijkstra methods, the proposed energy-efficient path planning for UGVs is formulated as a non-convex optimization problem by considering the collision-aware obstacle-avoidance. More specifically, the proposed path-planning scheme contains two stages, namely the semantic segmentation that localizes UGVs and obstacles in the environment by exploiting the wide-angle camera mounted on the UAV, followed by the trajectory generation in which a disciplined convex and concave programming (DCCP) algorithm is devised for the non-convex energy-minimization problem. Extensive experiments validate the effectiveness of the UAV-UGV cooperative system and the proposed DCCP-based path-planning scheme.  © 1967-2012 IEEE.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85128700439&doi=10.1109%2fTVT.2022.3168574&partnerID=40&md5=b8a5406a70575095f8ae9210295b4eec,IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology,2022
Security Vulnerabilities and Protection Algorithms for Backpressure-Based Traffic Signal Control at an Isolated Intersection,"There is an increasing trend in the use of wireless communication along with new traffic signal control (TSC) algorithms to leverage and accommodate connected and autonomous vehicles. However, this development has increased the potential for cyber-attacks on TSC that can undermine the benefits of these new algorithms. An advanced persistent adversary can learn the behavior of TSC algorithms and launch attacks to preferentially get green time and/or to create traffic congestion in one intersection which can spread to the entire network. In this paper, we consider backpressure-based (BP-based) TSC algorithms and compare their performance under two misinformation attacks - 1) time spoofing attack in which vehicles alter their arrival times at the intersection and 2) ghost vehicle attack in which vehicles disconnect the wireless communication and thereby hide from the TSC. We show that these misinformation can influence the signal phases determined by BP-based TSC algorithms. We consider an adversary that determines a set of arriving vehicles to be attack vehicles from many candidate sets (attack strategies) in order to maximize the number of disrupted signal phases. We show that by formulating the problem as a 0/1 Knapsack problem, the adversary can explore the space of attack strategies and determine the optimal strategy that maximally compromises the performance in terms of average delay and fairness. We propose two protection algorithms, namely, auction-based (APA) and hybrid-based (HPA) algorithms and show that they are able to mitigate the impacts of the misinformation attacks. © 2000-2011 IEEE.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85101281749&doi=10.1109%2fTITS.2021.3056658&partnerID=40&md5=5889df28001c1d75a774c00e0a2531cb,IEEE Transactions on Intelligent Transportation Systems,2022
"Detection and Isolation of Sensor Attacks for Autonomous Vehicles: Framework, Algorithms, and Validation","This paper investigates the cyber-security problem for autonomous vehicles under sensor attacks. In particular, a model-based framework is proposed which can detect sensor attacks and identify their sources in order to achieve the secure localization of self-driving vehicles. To ensure robustness of the vehicle against cyber-attacks, sensor redundancy is introduced, that is to deploy multiple sensors, each of which provides real-time pose observations of the vehicle. A bank of attack detectors is developed to capture anomalies in each sensor measurement, which is a combination of an extended Kalman filter (EKF) and a cumulative sum (CUSUM) discriminator. EKFs are employed to estimate the vehicle position and orientation recursively, while each CUSUM discriminator is designed to analyze the residual generated by its combined EKF to detect the possible deviation of the sensor measurement from the expected pose derived according to the mathematical model of the vehicle. To monitor the inconsistency amongst multiple sensor measurements, an auxiliary detector is introduced which fuses observations from multiple sensors. Based on the results of all the detectors, a rule-based isolation scheme is developed to identify the source anomalous sensor. The effectiveness of our proposed framework has been demonstrated on real vehicle data. © 2000-2011 IEEE.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85105851584&doi=10.1109%2fTITS.2021.3077015&partnerID=40&md5=86d20c0cde3e16e4fd655ac63c193c80,IEEE Transactions on Intelligent Transportation Systems,2022
Prototyping and Evaluation of Infrastructure-Assisted Transition of Control for Cooperative Automated Vehicles,"Automated driving is now possible in diverse road and traffic conditions. However, there are still situations that automated vehicles cannot handle safely and efficiently. In this case, a Transition of Control (ToC) is necessary so that the driver takes control of the driving. Executing a ToC requires the driver to get full situation awareness of the driving environment. If the driver fails to get back the control in a limited time, a Minimum Risk Maneuver (MRM) is executed to bring the vehicle into a safe state (e.g., decelerating to full stop). The execution of ToCs requires some time and can cause traffic disruption and safety risks that increase if several vehicles execute ToCs/MRMs at similar times and in the same area. This study proposes to use novel C-ITS traffic management measures where the infrastructure exploits V2X communications to assist Connected and Automated Vehicles (CAVs) in the execution of ToCs. The infrastructure can suggest a spatial distribution of ToCs, and inform vehicles of the locations where they could execute a safe stop in case of MRM. This paper reports the first field operational tests that validate the feasibility and quantify the benefits of the proposed infrastructure-assisted ToC and MRM management. The paper also presents the CAV and roadside infrastructure prototypes implemented and used in the trials. The conducted field trials demonstrate that infrastructure-assisted traffic management solutions can reduce safety risks and traffic disruptions. © 2000-2011 IEEE.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85102313956&doi=10.1109%2fTITS.2021.3061085&partnerID=40&md5=86b841826d44819ce05ebd5cb06f28fd,IEEE Transactions on Intelligent Transportation Systems,2022
Cyber Attack Detection and Isolation for a Quadrotor UAV With Modified Sliding Innovation Sequences,"Common vulnerabilities in typical intelligent cyber-physical systems such as unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) can be easily exploited by cyber attackers to cause serious accidents and harm. For successful UAV operations, security against cyber attacks is imperative. In this paper, we propose a modified sliding innovation sequences (MSIS) detector, based on the extended Kalman filter optimal state estimation, for a dynamic quadrotor system to detect cyber attacks inflicted on both its actuators and sensors in real time. These cyber attacks include random attacks, false data injection (FDI) attacks and denial-of-service (DoS) attacks. The MSIS detector computes the operator norm of the normalized innovation (residual) sequence within a sliding time window and triggers the alarm if the value is above the preset threshold. For a quadrotor undergoing rapid turns in a complex trajectory, the detector observes a reduced false alarm rate as compared to other state estimation-based detectors. To address the initial estimation error problem, we implement an iteration procedure to initiate and calibrate the detector. By evaluating the sample covariance of the normalized innovation sequence, the MSIS detector has the capability to isolate cyber attacks. Finally, simulation results of a quadrotor in a periodic, complex trajectory flight are provided to verify the effectiveness of the MSIS detection and isolation method.  © 1967-2012 IEEE.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85129666543&doi=10.1109%2fTVT.2022.3170725&partnerID=40&md5=7eae3e3c4b3e3baea94ed5c187ef0d62,IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology,2022
"Wireless Information and Power Transfer for IoT: Pulse Position Modulation, Integrated Receiver, and Experimental Validation","Simultaneous wireless information and power transfer (SWIPT) has emerged as a viable technique to energize and connect low-power autonomous devices and enable future Internet of Things (IoT). A major challenge of SWIPT is the energy consumption of the receiver of such low-power devices. An attractive low-power solution consists of an integrated information decoder (ID) and energy harvester (EH) architecture for SWIPT receiver (IntRx) where the received radiofrequency (RF) signal is first rectified before being used for information decoding. Such architecture eliminates the need for energy-consuming RF components, such as local oscillators and mixers. This article proposes a novel modulation and demodulation method for the IntRx SWIPT architecture based on pulse position modulation (PPM) where information is encoded in the position of the pulse. The new method transmits high amplitude pulses to increase the peak-to-average power ratio (PAPR) of the transmit signal and exploits the EH's nonlinearity so as to boost the harvested dc power. Simultaneously, the information can be decoded from the rectifier signal by simply finding the position of the pulse in a certain symbol duration. We have analyzed both the information and the power transfer performance of the newly proposed PPM for IntRx SWIPT theoretically, numerically, and experimentally. To that end, we have established a SWIPT system testbed in an indoor environment by prototyping a base station to transfer information-power signal and the IntRx SWIPT receiver, including ID and EH blocks. The performance evaluation of the PPM was carried out in various conditions, and the results have been compared and contrasted to conventional signals. Theoretical, numerical, and experimental results highlight the significant benefits of the proposed PPM scheme to enhance the power transfer performance and operate information decoding with low-power consumption.  © 2014 IEEE.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85121762611&doi=10.1109%2fJIOT.2021.3135712&partnerID=40&md5=69fe7f74e8d69c627a94f07d7e08b88e,IEEE Internet of Things Journal,2022
Autonomous UAV Path-Planning Optimization Using Metaheuristic Approach for Predisaster Assessment,"In this article, different state-of-the-art metaheuristic algorithms are analyzed to incorporate the collision-free path-planning approach for UAVs in a disaster situation. The efficient path planning is used to identify the main cause of disaster like bushfires that are badly affecting the forest ecosystem throughout the globe. This novel approach is a first step toward a predisaster assessment and possibilities to save the survivors in minimal time. Different metaheuristic algorithms, such as PSO, GWO, WOA, BMO, and DGBCO, are compared for UAV path optimization capability. In order to test the robustness of our proposed model, four different scenarios are presented which include general environment, condense environment, maze environment, and dynamic environment. In each scenario, the obstacles are placed in such a way to increase the overall path complexity for a UAV to reach the destination. The exploration and exploitation groups working simultaneously in a dynamic environment make it effective for UAV path planning using the DGBCO algorithm. Based on the parameters selected, the DGBCO algorithm outperforms other algorithms and achieves 24.5% less transportation cost and 13.3% less computational time. Hence, DGBCO can be efficiently applied for UAV path-planning optimization in any of the aforementioned environments. © 2014 IEEE.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85122067746&doi=10.1109%2fJIOT.2021.3137331&partnerID=40&md5=5e15f27dd404e114658546a4aa493091,IEEE Internet of Things Journal,2022
A Cloud-Assisted Reliable Trust Computing Scheme for Data Collection in Internet of Things,"Large number of Internet of Things (IoT) applications with intelligent sensing devices (ISDs) are combined with cloud computing to collect and process data more efficiently. However, ISDs are vulnerable to various attacks. Compromised devices may maliciously provide unreliable data to the cloud, causing damage to IoT applications. Therefore, it is a critical issue to design an effective mechanism to ensure the security of data collection in cloud computing. In this article, a cloud-assisted reliable trust computing (CRTC) scheme is proposed to identify the trust of ISDs at low cost, providing high-quality data for IoT applications. The CRTC scheme mainly includes the following parts: First, a reliable approach of obtaining the real data of ISDs at a low cost is proposed to identify the trust of ISDs. In the proposed method, ISDs fits the forwarding packets information to form inspection information (II) with a small amount of data and then sends II to inspection nodes, effectively reducing the cost of routing II. Second, an effective method of trust computing is given to evaluate the trustworthiness of ISDs based on the data and II collected by unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV). Then, the aggregators are selected from high-trust ISDs to ensure secure data collection. Third, to obtain more reliable trust at lower cost, a trajectory optimization algorithm for UAV is proposed to collect as much II as possible and reduce the moving distance. Theoretical analysis and experimental results show that the proposed CRTC scheme is superior to previous strategies in terms of the success rate of data collection, the speed of identifying the trust of ISDs, and the UAV's trajectory distance.  © 2005-2012 IEEE.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85129338688&doi=10.1109%2fTII.2021.3108149&partnerID=40&md5=aedc6ee673c947f5b90444b1804a0a7a,IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics,2022
Cluster-Based Characterization and Modeling for UAV Air-to-Ground Time-Varying Channels,"With the deep integration between the unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) and wireless communication, UAV-based air-to-ground (AG) propagation channels need more detailed descriptions and accurate models. In this paper, we aim to conduct cluster-based characterization and modeling for AG channels. To our best knowledge, this is the first study that concentrates on the clustering and tracking of multipath components (MPCs) for time-varying AG channels. Based on measurement data at 6.5 GHz with a bandwidth of 500 MHz, we first estimate potential MPCs utilizing the space-alternating generalized expectation-maximization (SAGE) algorithm. Then, we cluster the extracted MPCs by employing K-Power-Means (KPM) algorithm under multipath component distance (MCD) measure. For characterizing time-variant clusters, we exploit a clustering-based tracking (CBT) method, which efficiently quantifies the survival lengths of clusters. Ultimately, we establish a cluster-based channel model, and validations illustrate the accuracy of the proposed model.

Bift: A Blockchain-Based Federated Learning System for Connected and Autonomous Vehicles,"Machine learning (ML) algorithms are essential components in autonomous driving. In most existing connected and autonomous vehicles (CAVs), a large amount of driving data collected from multiple vehicles are sent to a central server for unified training. However, data privacy and security have become crucial during the data-sharing process. Federated learning (FL) for data security has arisen nowadays, and it can improve the data privacy of distribute machine learning. However, the malicious attackers can still be able to attack the training process. Due to the complete reliance on the central server, FL is very fragile. To address the above problem, we propose Bift: 1) a fully decentralized ML system combined with FL and 2) blockchain to provide a privacy-preserving ML process for CAVs. Bift enables distributed CAVs to train ML models locally using their own driving data and then to upload the local models to get a better global model. More importantly, Bift provides a consensus algorithm named Proof of Federated Learning to resist possible adversaries. We evaluate the performance of Bift and demonstrate that Bift is scalable and robust, and can defend against malicious attacks.  © 2014 IEEE.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85121828428&doi=10.1109%2fJIOT.2021.3135342&partnerID=40&md5=ba884daa41499ca68b029c58f6c77b44,IEEE Internet of Things Journal,2022
Privacy-Preserved Federated Learning for Autonomous Driving,"In recent years, the privacy issue in Vehicular Edge Computing (VEC) has gained a lot of concern. The privacy problem is even more severe in autonomous driving business than the other businesses in VEC such as ordinary navigation. Federated learning (FL), which is a privacy-preserved strategy proposed by Google, has become a hot trend to solve the privacy problem in many fields including VEC. Therefore, we introduce FL into autonomous driving to preserve vehicular privacy by keeping original data in a local vehicle and sharing the training model parameter only with the help of MEC server. Moreover, different from the common assumption of honest MEC server and honest vehicle in former studies, we take the malicious MEC servers and malicious vehicles into account. First, we consider honest-but-curious MEC server and malicious vehicles and propose a traceable identity-based privacy preserving scheme to protect the vehicular message privacy where improved Dijk-Gentry-Halevi-Vaikutanathan (DGHV) algorithm is proposed and a blockchain-based Reputation-based Incentive Autonomous Driving Mechanism (RIADM) is adopted. Further, when the case comes to the non-credibility of both parties where semi-honest MEC server and malicious vehicles are considered, we propose an anonymous identity-based privacy preserving scheme to protect the identity privacy of vehicles with Zero-Knowledge Proof (ZKP). Based on the simulation of virtual autonomous driving based on real-world road images, it is verified that our proposes scheme can reduce 73.7 % training loss of autonomous driving, increase the accuracy to around 5.55 % while keeps effective privacy of message and identity under the threat of dishonest MEC server and vehicles.  © 2000-2011 IEEE.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85112191354&doi=10.1109%2fTITS.2021.3081560&partnerID=40&md5=19b48365a02c57cd734d131cc3898949,IEEE Transactions on Intelligent Transportation Systems,2022
Detection and Blind Channel Estimation for UAV-Aided Wireless Sensor Networks in Smart Cities under Mobile Jamming Attack,"Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) can be integrated into wireless sensor networks (WSNs) for smart city applications in several ways. Among them, a UAV can be employed as a relay in a 'store-carry and forward' fashion by uploading data from ground sensors and metering devices and, then, downloading it to a central unit. However, both the uploading and downloading phases can be prone to potential threats and attacks. As a legacy from traditional wireless networks, the jamming attack is still one of the major and serious threats to UAV-aided communications, especially when also the jammer is mobile, e.g., it is mounted on a UAV or inside a terrestrial vehicle. In this article, we investigate anti-jamming communications for UAV-aided WSNs operating over doubly selective channels in the downloading phase. In such a scenario, the signals transmitted by the UAV and the malicious mobile jammer undergo both time dispersion due to multipath propagation effects and frequency dispersion caused by their mobility. To suppress high-power jamming signals, we propose a blind physical-layer technique that jointly detects the UAV and jammer symbols through serial disturbance cancelation based on symbol-level post-sorting of the detector output. Amplitudes, phases, time delays, and Doppler shifts - required to implement the proposed detection strategy - are blindly estimated from data through the use of algorithms that exploit the almost-cyclostationarity properties of the received signal and the detailed structure of multicarrier modulation format. Simulation results corroborate the anti-jamming capabilities of the proposed method, for different mobility scenarios of the jammer.  © 2014 IEEE.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85120899774&doi=10.1109%2fJIOT.2021.3132381&partnerID=40&md5=35280edc6928588cec10c0b3c057663c,IEEE Internet of Things Journal,2022
A Secure Dynamic Mix Zone Pseudonym Changing Scheme Based on Traffic Context Prediction,"Traffic context plays an important role in supporting automated driving and intelligent transportation systems. Smart vehicles explore surrounding environments by analyzing sensor data and periodically communicating with neighbors and road infrastructures. The context can be well learned in this way to support driving, but the vehicle trajectory can be also easily exposed under eavesdropping attacks. The pseudonym is proposed to hide the real identity of the vehicles. However, the effectiveness of anonymity, the safety of driving, the convenience of implementation and the utilization of resources in previous approaches have not been well-balanced. Therefore, focusing on efficiently replacing pseudonyms with the premise of ensuring driving safety, we propose a secure dynamic silent mix zone pseudonym changing scheme (TLAS) based on the real-time traffic context prediction for urban regions. It naturally takes the area in front of the red traffic light as a silent mix zone, which avoids the driving security issue caused by signal silence. Besides, the area length is dynamically configured according to the traffic context predicted in the last green light cycle, so the anonymous effect can be improved. In addition, considering the resource utilization and accuracy requirement, the adaptive prediction algorithm is applied. We conduct simulation experiments with real-world traffic history using SUMO and OMNET++, the results show that TLAS strategy can indeed achieve a better anonymous effect (reducing standardized traceability rate by 8.2%) with lower driving speed for safety concern. © 2000-2011 IEEE.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85119421858&doi=10.1109%2fTITS.2021.3125744&partnerID=40&md5=406c9890e24d969efbca770910e61f50,IEEE Transactions on Intelligent Transportation Systems,2022
CSG: Classifier-Aware Defense Strategy Based on Compressive Sensing and Generative Networks for Visual Recognition in Autonomous Vehicle Systems,"Visual classification algorithms based-on Deep Neural Networks (DNN) have been widely adopted in autonomous vehicle design. However, DNN suffers from adversarial attacks including pixel attacks and patch attacks, and its adoption may introduce new vulnerability into such security-critical scenarios. Existing defense techniques only focus on defending against one category, either pixel attacks or patch attacks, but does not translate to the other. Hence, the design of a practical comprehensive real-time defense algorithm for DNN-based classifiers presents a challenging task in this adversarial context. This paper attempts to address the abovementioned problem by combining Compressive Sensing with Generative neural networks (CSG) to construct an efficient defense framework, in conjunction with the proposal of a classifier-aware adversarial training way. Extensive experiments have been conducted using the LISA road sign dataset to evaluate the performance of CSG. The results show its superiority in comprehensively defending adversarial examples generated using attacks including CW-L2, FGSM and Sticker, compared with other state-of-the-art defense techniques.  © 2000-2011 IEEE.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85124822140&doi=10.1109%2fTITS.2022.3146038&partnerID=40&md5=1aa76b0d902cb91ab66afbda34bcb399,IEEE Transactions on Intelligent Transportation Systems,2022
Enhancing navigation integrity for Urban Air Mobility with redundant inertial sensors,"Urban Air Mobility (UAM) uses highly automated air vehicles to offer safe and efficient low-altitude urban air transportation services, for which ensuring navigation safety (measured by integrity) is an essential precondition. UAM vehicles can navigate themselves using Global Navigation Satellite Systems (GNSS)/Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU) tightly coupled systems. However, these systems are vulnerable to IMU failures aside from GNSS faults, given that UAM vehicles will use low-cost IMUs. IMU faults can severely degrade navigation integrity, thereby threatening UAM operational safety and increasing the difficulty of urban air traffic management. This issue can be mitigated by employing redundant IMUs. Civil aircraft use consistency checks among multiple high-performance Inertial Navigation Systems (INSs) to enhance navigation integrity. But this approach is not suitable for low-cost IMUs because of fast error accumulation. In response, this work proposes a new approach to enhance navigation integrity for UAM by integrating multiple IMUs with GNSS. In this approach, multiple IMUs and GNSS are tightly coupled by a centralized Kalman filter, and the corresponding integrity monitoring algorithm is developed to (a) detect the faults in GNSS and/or IMUs and (b) evaluate the probabilistic upper bounds on navigation errors, namely protection levels. Simulations are conducted to demonstrate the proposed method and to present sensitivity analyses, and the results suggest the effectiveness of the new approach. This method is beneficial to improving UAM operational safety and can potentially be applied to civil aircraft in the future. © 2022 Elsevier Masson SAS",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85130358219&doi=10.1016%2fj.ast.2022.107631&partnerID=40&md5=e0fba1d1b131b839d18b55ecca048c76,Aerospace Science and Technology,2022
A Survey on Cyber-Security of Connected and Autonomous Vehicles (CAVs),"As the general development trend of the automotive industry, connected and autonomous vehicles (CAVs) can be used to increase transportation safety, promote mobility choices, reduce user costs, and create new job opportunities. However, with the increasing level of connectivity and automation, malicious users are able to easily implement different kinds of attacks, which threaten the security of CAVs. Hence, this paper provides a comprehensive survey on the cyber-security in the environment of CAVs with the aim of highlighting security problems and challenges. Firstly, based on the types of communication networks and attack objects, it classifies various cyber-security risks and vulnerabilities in the environment of CAVs into in-vehicle network attacks, vehicle to everything network attacks, and other attacks. Next, it regards cyber-risk as another type of attacks in the environment of CAVs. Then, it describes and analyzes up-to-date corresponding defense strategies for securing CAVs. In addition, it concludes several available cyber-security and safety standards of CAVs, which is helpful for the practical application of CAVs. Finally, several challenges and open problems are discussed for the future research. © 2000-2011 IEEE.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85111014220&doi=10.1109%2fTITS.2021.3085297&partnerID=40&md5=e0464f7ecd6c393fc6bf0dd073e560ef,IEEE Transactions on Intelligent Transportation Systems,2022
Blockchain-Integrated Multiagent Deep Reinforcement Learning for Securing Cooperative Adaptive Cruise Control,"Connected and Autonomous Vehicles (CAVs) are an emerging solution to the issues of safe and sustainable transportation systems in the future. One major transport technology for CAVs is Cooperative Adaptive Cruise Control (CACC), for which unsignalized autonomous intersection crossing is a growing use case. CACC relies heavily on inter-vehicular communication and is thus vulnerable to message forgery and jamming attacks. Most solutions for CACC focus exclusively on enhancing efficiency or security but do not offer an integrated framework for achieving both on a large scale. In this paper, we propose a Blockchain-integrated Multi-Agent Deep Reinforcement Learning (Block-MADRL) architecture for enhancing the efficiency of CACC while cooperatively detecting attacks, reducing the fuel efficiency of identified attackers and securely notifying the overall network. Our approach uses multi-agent deep reinforcement learning to find fuel and throughput optimizing solutions for CACC and a cooperative verification mechanism based on Extended Isolation Forest (EIF) for attack detection. Attacker data is securely stored in a Road Side Unit (RSU) level blockchain, and we design a low-latency, high throughput consensus protocol for speedy and secure data dissemination. Simulation results indicate over 29.5% better lane throughput with our approach during acceleration forgery attack, up to 23% induced reduction in fuel efficiency of malicious vehicles, 17.6% higher blockchain throughput through our consensus protocol and over 8% improvement in attack detection rate compared to the state-of-the-art.  © 2000-2011 IEEE.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85129388219&doi=10.1109%2fTITS.2022.3168486&partnerID=40&md5=7aac0059d169a914d03f332e0fabd4b8,IEEE Transactions on Intelligent Transportation Systems,2022
Multi-Helper NOMA for Cooperative Mobile Edge Computing,"The next-generation wireless networks are expected to support a number of computation-intensive and delay-sensitive applications such as virtual reality (VR), autonomous driving, telesurgery and unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs). Since many devices are computation and power limited, mobile edge computing (MEC) has been deemed as a promising way to enhance computation service. In this paper, we propose a novel cooperative MEC that exploits the combination of non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) and multiple helpers. In the proposed system featuring a user, multiple helpers and a base station (BS), the user can simultaneously offload its computation-intensive tasks to the helpers using NOMA when there is no strong direct transmission link between the user and the BS. Then, the helpers can compute and offload these tasks through NOMA. Thus, in the proposed scheme, the computation and offloading modes at the helpers are determined with respect to the optimized task offloading decision factor. The simulation results show that the proposed NOMA-based cooperative MEC significantly increases the total offloading data under the latency constraints compared to the benchmark schemes featuring one helper with strong direct transmission link. © 2000-2011 IEEE.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85117258046&doi=10.1109%2fTITS.2021.3116421&partnerID=40&md5=47e6ff2e41fdff75176df6abb6a9e8f4,IEEE Transactions on Intelligent Transportation Systems,2022
A Reinforcement Learning Approach for Enacting Cautious Behaviours in Autonomous Driving System: Safe Speed Choice in the Interaction With Distracted Pedestrians,"Driving requires the ability to handle unpredictable situations. Since it is not always possible to predict an impending danger, a good driver should preventively assess whether a situation has risks and adopt a safe behavior. Considering, in particular, the possibility of a pedestrian suddenly crossing the road, a prudent driver should limit the traveling speed. We present a work exploiting reinforcement learning to learn a function that specifies the safe speed limit for a given artificial driver agent. The safe speed function acts as a behavioral directive for the agent, thus extending its cognitive abilities. We consider scenarios where the vehicle interacts with a distracted pedestrian that might cross the road in hard-to-predict ways and propose a neural network mapping the pedestrian's context onto the appropriate traveling speed so that the autonomous vehicle can successfully perform emergency braking maneuvers. We discuss the advantages of developing a specialized neural network extension on top of an already functioning autonomous driving system, removing the burden of learning to drive from scratch while focusing on learning safe behavior at a high-level. We demonstrate how the safe speed function can be learned in simulation and then transferred into a real vehicle. We include a statistical analysis of the network's improvements compared to the original autonomous driving system.

Traveling Salesman Problem with neighborhoods on a sphere in reflectance transformation imaging scenarios,"In this paper, we propose a solution to the non-Euclidean variant of the Traveling Salesman Problem with Neighborhoods on a Sphere (TSPNS). The introduced problem formulation is motivated by practical scenarios of employing unmanned aerial vehicles in the Reflectance Transformation Imaging (RTI). In the RTI, a vehicle is requested to visit a set of sites at a constant distance from the object of interest and cast light from different directions to model the object from the images captured from another fixed location. Even though the problem can be formulated as an instance of the regular traveling salesman problem, we report a significant reduction of the solution cost by exploiting a non-zero tolerance on the light direction and defining the sites as regions on a sphere. The continuous neighborhoods of the TSPNS can be sampled into discrete sets, and the problem can be transformed into the generalized traveling salesman problem. However, finding high-quality solutions requires dense sampling, which increases the computational requirements. Therefore, we propose a practical heuristic solution based on the unsupervised learning of the Growing Self-Organizing Array (GSOA) that quickly finds an initial solution with the competitive quality to the sampling-based method. Furthermore, we propose a fast post-processing optimization to improve the initial solutions of both solvers. Based on the reported results, the proposed GSOA-based solver provides solutions of a similar quality to the transformation approach while it is about two orders of magnitude less computationally demanding. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85127006924&doi=10.1016%2fj.eswa.2022.116814&partnerID=40&md5=f5cd74643dbe6467341c1dd7beaaec89,Expert Systems with Applications,2022
Hazardous Scenario Enhanced Generation for Automated Vehicle Testing Based on Optimization Searching Method,"The scenario-based test method is the research hotspot of automated vehicle (AV) validation and verification (V&V), and testing with hazardous scenarios is of important means. An Optimization Searching (OS) method for enhanced generation in hazardous scenarios is proposed in this paper to efficiently explore functional boundary scenarios in a huge logical state space. The method is computationally tractable, and its generated experimental parameters are optimized using past test results. The method includes five essential modules. The Exploration and Exploitation module uses the Multi-arm bandit method to obtain the greatest sum of the $TTC^{\mathbf {-1}}$ (Time To Collision). The Parameter Moving Probability Determination module uses an analytic hierarchy process to ensure that influential parameters are more likely to move. The Step Size Determination module is built with Levy-step to find a greater number of hazardous scenarios. The Memory Function module is used to avoid repeat experiments that can reduce computing efficiency. The Result Analysis module creates a hazard parameter space for subsequent tests. We tested an ACC (Adaptive Cruise Control) algorithm with a specified logical scenario in the virtual environment built by PreScan. The results showed that the OS method can effectively discover the dangerous range with the tested ACC algorithm, and its test speed can reach more than five times that of an exhaustive algorithm without prior knowledge. © 2000-2011 IEEE.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85103783729&doi=10.1109%2fTITS.2021.3068784&partnerID=40&md5=871132d59156b0ce48fb9aa10f6f4e2c,IEEE Transactions on Intelligent Transportation Systems,2022
Path Planning and Following Control of Autonomous Bus Under Time-Varying Parameters Against Parametric Uncertainties and External Disturbances,"Path planning and path following are key technologies for autonomous vehicles. Strong nonlinearity, coupling characteristics, parametric uncertainties, external disturbances, and complicated driving scenarios put forward great challenges in estimation, control, and optimization of autonomous vehicles. Multi-dimension information utilization offers an effective solution to cope with the foregoing challenges. The presented research proposes a path planning and tracking framework for optimal design and regulation of control variables for collision avoidance and active guidance system, aiming to improve tracking performance and system robustness. For path planning approach, a virtual harmful potential field in 3 dimension (3D) is built to provide a collision-free trajectory as a reference path for path following, depending on vehicle kinematic model and boundary conditions of roads. A linear parameter-varying, polytopic vehicle lateral model is developed to address the issues of time-variable longitudinal speeds and preview distance on vehicle lateral stability management. Further, a strong robust gain-scheduling path following control approach based on linear matrix inequality methodology is proposed to tackle problems relating to characteristics of temporal variations, parametric uncertainties and external disturbances. Comparisons study under the TruckMaker/Xpack4-RapidECU joint HIL platform demonstrate that both tracking precision and high robustness to parametric uncertainties and external disturbances are superior than model predictive control method. The presented path following method provides an important insight into exploiting the robust control method's favorable merits while guaranteeing its computing efficiency.  © 1967-2012 IEEE.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85129654071&doi=10.1109%2fTVT.2022.3170440&partnerID=40&md5=dea38fbbd79d396b58dc6e0c615d244c,IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology,2022
Detection of False Data Injection Attack in Connected and Automated Vehicles via Cloud-Based Sandboxing,"In recent years, developments in vehicle-to-everything communication (V2X) have steadily increased in applications such as platooning and collision avoidance. V2X provides vehicles with long-range information regarding traffic congestion and routing, but also short and mid-range information allowing cooperative adaptive cruise control, automatic collision warnings, and others. Despite being potentially beneficial in several aspects, such interdependence poses a set of specific challenges from safety and reliability standpoint due to the possibility of cyber-attacks aimed at influencing the behavior of the vehicles. In this paper, a Cloud-based approach, a sandboxing framework is presented to detect the false data injection attack on connected and automated vehicles (CAVs). The sandboxing concept comes from computer security and it is adopted in a control framework as a way to isolate and evaluate the data exchanged by the CAVs affecting the vehicle control system. Numerical experiments are conducted to show the effectiveness of the approach using microscopic traffic simulation. Simulation results show that our proposed methodology is able to detect the false data injection attack existing in the V2X communication and identify the attacker in real-time less than 0.2 s.  © 2000-2011 IEEE.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85112436845&doi=10.1109%2fTITS.2021.3090361&partnerID=40&md5=b9434f3c57b94d1c497cb69f51d8cc08,IEEE Transactions on Intelligent Transportation Systems,2022
PERFECT: Positional-Forgery Resistant Traffic Gap Estimation for Connected Intersection Management,"Connected and Autonomous Vehicles (CAVs) are set to be the next global revolution in transportation. One of the major challenges in a CAV environment is handling the positional-forgery of Basic Safety Messages while calculating critical traffic gaps at a Stop Sign Gap Assist controlled intersection. Traditionally, positional-forgery has been handled by isolated instances of physical layer detection and correction mechanisms, which proved unreliable during the multi-hop and majority malicious vehicle scenarios. In this work, we propose a novel framework called Positional-forgEry Resistant traFfic gap Estimation for Connected inTersection management (PERFECT) that performs optimal traffic gap estimation even during multi-hop scenarios and majority malicious positional-forgery attacks. The framework reduces traffic gap estimation error during majority malicious scenarios by over 60%, keeps the average error within 8.17%-10.62% and minimizes the maximum error across a range of malicious situations. © 1967-2012 IEEE.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85132506755&doi=10.1109%2fTVT.2022.3173901&partnerID=40&md5=eefc730cf97b7fd13bb10afd4a7becb2,IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology,2022
Scheduling of UAV-Assisted Millimeter Wave Communications for High-Speed Railway,"To exploit richer spectrum resources for even better service quality, millimeter wave (mmWave) communication has been considered for high-speed railway (HSR) communication systems. In this paper, we focus on scheduling as many flows as possible while satisfying their QoS requirements. Due to interference, eavesdropping, or other problems, some flows may not be directly transmitted from the track-side BS. In this paper, we propose an UAV-assisted scheduling scheme which utilizes a UAV to serve as relay for such flows. The proposed scheme also utilize two mmWave bands, one for the BS links and the other for the UAV links. The proposed algorithm aims to maximize the number of flows with their QoS requirements satisfied. Simulations demonstrate that the proposed scheme achieves a superior performance on the number of completed flows and the system throughput over two baseline schemes. © 1967-2012 IEEE.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85130775881&doi=10.1109%2fTVT.2022.3176855&partnerID=40&md5=af0b9aef99913859b2d5c3a85e3d385d,IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology,2022
PROACT: Parallel multi-miner proof of accumulated trust protocol for Internet of Drones,"Several types of networks that comprise unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV or drone) are being utilized in important applications such as emergency response, environment and infrastructure monitoring, defense and security, and commerce. In such networks, swarms of UAVs cooperate in executing one or more missions to achieve the application's objectives. The UAVs communicate with terrestrial networks by connecting to fixed or mobile ground control stations (GCS). The ability of drones to connect to online applications and offer services to Internet users has led to the proliferation of the Internet of Drones (IoD). However, IoD applications are highly vulnerable to many types of cyberattacks. Hence, mechanisms must be deployed to secure the IoD operations and data. Recently, the blockchain has been proposed as a solution to detect and prevent malicious attacks on the UAV network (UAVN). Due to the UAV's limited resources, it becomes a challenge to integrate the blockchain into the IoD. In this paper, we propose a model that enables a drone to store the important data that it requires during its flight within a lightweight blockchain system. In addition, we propose a new blockchain consensus mechanism in which several miners produce their blocks in parallel, which decreases the time needed to add transactions securely to the blockchain and meets the requirements of delay-sensitive applications. Our simulations prove the advantages of the proposed model in decreasing the transaction-to-blockchain delay, the average drone energy consumption, and the blockchain block size as compared to other IoD blockchain systems. © 2022 Elsevier Inc.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85132439556&doi=10.1016%2fj.vehcom.2022.100495&partnerID=40&md5=2f753cfa3c0c593f2b5290e40da06e61,Vehicular Communications,2022

Adversarial Evaluation of Autonomous Vehicles in Lane-Change Scenarios,"Autonomous vehicles must be comprehensively evaluated before deployed in cities and highways. However, most existing evaluation approaches for autonomous vehicles are static and lack adaptability, so they are usually inefficient in generating challenging scenarios for tested vehicles. In this paper, we propose an adaptive evaluation framework to efficiently evaluate autonomous vehicles in adversarial environments generated by deep reinforcement learning. Considering the multimodal nature of dangerous scenarios, we use ensemble models to represent different local optimums for diversity. We then utilize a nonparametric Bayesian method to cluster the adversarial policies. The proposed method is validated in a typical lane-change scenario that involves frequent interactions between the ego vehicle and the surrounding vehicles. Results show that the adversarial scenarios generated by our method significantly degrade the performance of the tested vehicles. We also illustrate different patterns of generated adversarial environments, which can be used to infer the weaknesses of the tested vehicles.  © 2000-2011 IEEE.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85112234538&doi=10.1109%2fTITS.2021.3091477&partnerID=40&md5=9cc22be53ada96e32c8305c05ecbce29,IEEE Transactions on Intelligent Transportation Systems,2022
A3C-Based Intelligent Event-Triggering Control of Networked Nonlinear Unmanned Marine Vehicles Subject to Hybrid Attacks,"This paper is concerned with the intelligent event-triggering-based positioning control of networked unmanned marine vehicle (UMV) systems with hybrid attacks, where the UMV and control station is connected by a communication network and the DoS attack and Deception attack are studied. Firstly, a stochastic switched Takagi-Sugeno (T-S) fuzzy system model is proposed for the networked nonlinear UMV systems subject to aperiodic DoS attack and random Deception attack.

Security Energy Efficiency Analysis of Analog Collaborative Beamforming With Stochastic Virtual Antenna Array of UAV Swarm,"To extend the transmission range governed by limited transmit power, collaborative beamforming (CB) can be employed with a virtual antenna array (VAA) constructed by an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) swarm. CB techniques combined with physical layer security (PLS) algorithms are known to better secure transmissions of sensitive information in the presence of eavesdropping attacks, compared to co-located antenna-based schemes. In particular, analog collaborative beamforming (ACB) with random VAA topologies, which is suitable for UAV networks due to its lower signaling/channel estimation overhead compared to the digital CB, can provide a significantly higher secrecy rate by creating noise-like signals at eavesdroppers. However, the increase in energy consumption to improve secrecy rate had been ignored in the existing ACB-based PLS schemes, which is of paramount importance considering the limited onboard energy of UAVs. Thus, motivated by such limitation, in this paper, we examine the security energy efficiency of the ACB-based PLS technique, where a group of UAVs (or VAA elements) randomly change their locations in a distributed manner to randomize the array factor of the VAA, i.e., a stochastic VAA. The proposed stochastic VAA outperforms the existing static VAA in terms of secrecy energy efficiency as verified by analytic and numerical results. Further, the impact of phase errors of the proposed scheme is also presented, which indicates the significance of the accurate phase estimation. © 1967-2012 IEEE.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85129672926&doi=10.1109%2fTVT.2022.3171313&partnerID=40&md5=6765c92b54f00fbdded6bb02adc219b9,IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology,2022
Service-Oriented Real-Time Energy-Optimal Regenerative Braking Strategy for Connected and Autonomous Electrified Vehicles,"This paper presents a real-time vehicle speed planning system called the real-time energy-optimal deceleration planning system (RT-EDPS). Connectivity and autonomous driving technologies that provide map and navigation data, traffic light information, and front detection sensor data are exploited to perceive and forecast upcoming deceleration events. A parameterized polynomial-based deceleration model is employed as the deceleration strategy. Real driving test data that characterize the physical limits of regenerative braking are used to model the objective function and constraints of the parameterized deceleration commands. The proposed RT-EDPS involves two speed-planning strategies with different scales of the planning horizon. Within a deceleration event horizon ascertained by the signal phase and timing data of traffic signals and 3D geographic map data, a dynamic programming-based energy-efficient deceleration strategy is used to generate long-sighted speed profiles. While the scheduled vehicle speed is being tracked, if a preceding vehicle is detected within a predefined threshold range, then a model predictive control-based energy-efficient deceleration strategy that incorporates the traffic status ahead of the ego vehicle and exploits V2V communication with the preceding vehicles is activated to re-plan the speed trajectory of the vehicle to guarantee a collision-free distance for the preceding vehicle. In virtual driving experiments, we record energy-recuperation efficiency gains of over 40% as compared to human drivers.  © 2000-2011 IEEE.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85112594660&doi=10.1109%2fTITS.2021.3099812&partnerID=40&md5=01e5f534f42be584b342316f9e041845,IEEE Transactions on Intelligent Transportation Systems,2022
Daedalus: Breaking Nonmaximum Suppression in Object Detection via Adversarial Examples,"This article demonstrates that nonmaximum suppression (NMS), which is commonly used in object detection (OD) tasks to filter redundant detection results, is no longer secure. Considering that NMS has been an integral part of OD systems, thwarting the functionality of NMS can result in unexpected or even lethal consequences for such systems. In this article, an adversarial example attack that triggers malfunctioning of NMS in OD models is proposed. The attack, namely, Daedalus, compresses the dimensions of detection boxes to evade NMS. As a result, the final detection output contains extremely dense false positives. This can be fatal for many OD applications, such as autonomous vehicles and surveillance systems. The attack can be generalized to different OD models, such that the attack cripples various OD applications. Furthermore, a way of crafting robust adversarial examples is developed by using an ensemble of popular detection models as the substitutes. Considering the pervasive nature of model reuse in real-world OD scenarios, Daedalus examples crafted based on an ensemble of substitutes can launch attacks without knowing the parameters of the victim models. The experimental results demonstrate that the attack effectively stops NMS from filtering redundant bounding boxes. As the evaluation results suggest, Daedalus increases the false positive rate in detection results to 99.9% and reduces the mean average precision scores to 0, while maintaining a low cost of distortion on the original inputs. It also demonstrates that the attack can be practically launched against real-world OD systems via printed posters.  © 2013 IEEE.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85099195781&doi=10.1109%2fTCYB.2020.3041481&partnerID=40&md5=de3e1c102bf6664463027c98da384251,IEEE Transactions on Cybernetics,2022
H-TD2: Hybrid Temporal Difference Learning for Adaptive Urban Taxi Dispatch,"We present H-TD2: Hybrid Temporal Difference Learning for Taxi Dispatch, a model-free, adaptive decision-making algorithm to coordinate a large fleet of automated taxis in a dynamic urban environment to minimize expected customer waiting times. Our scalable algorithm exploits the natural transportation network company topology by switching between two behaviors: distributed temporal-difference learning computed locally at each taxi and infrequent centralized Bellman updates computed at the dispatch center. We derive a regret bound and design the trigger condition between the two behaviors to explicitly control the trade-off between computational complexity and the individual taxi policy's bounded sub-optimality; this advances the state of the art by enabling distributed operation with bounded-suboptimality. Additionally, unlike recent reinforcement learning dispatch methods, this policy estimation is adaptive and robust to out-of-training domain events.

Are socially-aware trajectory prediction models really socially-aware?,"Our transportation field has recently witnessed an arms race of neural network-based trajectory predictors. While these predictors are at the core of many applications such as autonomous navigation or pedestrian flow simulations, their adversarial robustness has not been carefully studied. In this paper, we introduce a socially-attended attack to assess the social understanding of prediction models in terms of collision avoidance. An attack is a small yet carefully-crafted perturbations to fail predictors. Technically, we define collision as a failure mode of the output, and propose hard- and soft-attention mechanisms to guide our attack. Thanks to our attack, we shed light on the limitations of the current models in terms of their social understanding. We demonstrate the strengths of our method on the recent trajectory prediction models. Finally, we show that our attack can be employed to increase the social understanding of state-of-the-art models.

Mitigating Traffic Remapping Attacks in Autonomous Multihop Wireless Networks,"Multihop wireless networks with autonomous nodes are susceptible to selfish traffic remapping attacks (TRAs). Nodes launching TRAs leverage the underlying channel access function to receive an unduly high Quality of Service (QoS) for packet flows traversing source-to-destination routes. TRAs are easy to execute, impossible to prevent, difficult to detect, and harmful to the QoS of honest nodes. Recognizing the need for providing QoS security, we use a novel network-oriented QoS metric to propose a self-enforcing game-theoretic mitigation approach. By switching between TRA and honest behavior, selfish nodes engage in a noncooperative multistage game in pursuit of high QoS. We analyze feasible node strategies and design a distributed signaling mechanism called DISTRESS, under which, given certain conditions, the game produces a desirable outcome: after an upper bounded play time, honesty tends to become a selfish node's best reply behavior, while yielding acceptable QoS to most or all nodes. We verify these findings by Monte Carlo and ns-3 simulations of static and mobile nodes.  © 2014 IEEE.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85123381810&doi=10.1109%2fJIOT.2022.3143713&partnerID=40&md5=15a63a5efd3648c494f4250fa6cac796,IEEE Internet of Things Journal,2022
Event-Triggering and Quantized Sliding Mode Control of UMV Systems Under DoS Attack,"This paper is concerned with security control of nonlinear unmanned marine vehicle (UMV) systems under a networked environment. The UMV system and land-based control station are connected by a communication network. Considering the limited communication resource in the marine environment, the dynamic event-triggering mechanisms are proposed in the sensor to controller and controller to actuator sides simultaneously. Meanwhile, the triggered output data is then quantized by a logarithmic quantizer before being sent to the remote control station. First, based on the Takagi-Sugeno (T-S) fuzzy theory, the nonlinear UMV system is molded as a T-S fuzzy model. Then a hybrid switched fuzzy system is established by taking the DoS attack and quantization effect into account. An observer-based sliding mode control (SMC) scheme is proposed to stabilize the system under DoS attack, and the observer gains and controller gains can be obtained by solving a set of matrix inequalities. Finally, a benchmark UMV system is used to show the effectiveness of control scheme. © 1967-2012 IEEE.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85130507464&doi=10.1109%2fTVT.2022.3175726&partnerID=40&md5=f43aa635e366756dfe70fbe2b0560307,IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology,2022
ReCF: Exploiting Response Reasoning for Correlation Filters in Real-Time UAV Tracking,"Object tracking is a fundamental task for the visual perception system on the intelligent unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV). The high efficiency of correlation filter (CF) based trackers has advanced the widespread development of online UAV object tracking. This kind of method can effectively train a filter to discriminate the target from the background. However, most CF-based methods require a fixed label function over all the previous samples, leading to over-fitting and filter degradation, especially in complex drone scenarios. To address this problem, a novel adaptive response reasoning approach is proposed for CF learning. It can leverage temporal information in filter training and significantly promote the robustness of the tracker. Specifically, the proposed response reasoning method goes beyond the standard response consistency requirement and constructs an auxiliary label of the current sample. Besides, it helps learn a generic relationship between the previous and current filters, thereby realizing self-regulated filter updating and enhancing the discriminability of the filter. Extensive experiments on four well-known challenging UAV tracking benchmarks with 278 videos sequences show that the presented method yields superior results to 40 state-of-the-art trackers with real-time performance on a single CPU, which is suitable for UAV online tracking missions.  © 2000-2011 IEEE.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85110850830&doi=10.1109%2fTITS.2021.3094654&partnerID=40&md5=7827c4450ada5c03aeee23099e345f9a,IEEE Transactions on Intelligent Transportation Systems,2022
Multi-PPTP: Multiple Probabilistic Pedestrian Trajectory Prediction in the Complex Junction Scene,"Pedestrian trajectory prediction in dynamic, multi-agent traffic junction scene is an important problem in the context of self-driving cars. Accurately predicting the trajectory of the agent, especially the pedestrian with high randomness, is of great significance to autonomous driving technology. In this paper, we propose Multi-PPTP, a novel trajectory prediction model that first utilizes a composite rasterized map to model the complex representations and interactions of road components, including dynamic obstacles (e.g., pedestrians, vehicles, and cyclists) and static road information (e.g., lanes, traffic lights, and sidewalks). Then it uses MapNet and AgentNet to extract spatio-temporal features by deep convolutional networks and LSTM to automatically derive relevant features, and next exploits Interaction-AttNet aggregate features to learn the high interactions among all components by affine transformation and multi-head attention mechanism. Additionally, we also propose a series of unique loss functions to predict multiple possible trajectories of each pedestrian while estimating their probabilities. Following extensive offline evaluation and comparison to the state-of-the-art models, our approach outperforms significantly the state-of-the-art models on our large scale in-house and public nuScenes dataset.  © 2000-2011 IEEE.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85120074939&doi=10.1109%2fTITS.2021.3127539&partnerID=40&md5=f0bfabe50eec8f27d5cc1847fcb7a289,IEEE Transactions on Intelligent Transportation Systems,2022
Overriding Autonomous Driving Systems Using Adaptive Adversarial Billboards,"The success of deep neural networks (DNNs) has led to its increased deployment in various real-world applications, which provides strong incentives for motivated adversaries to manipulate the results and models generated by these algorithms. We present an automated, physically-realizable, dynamic adversarial attack to compromise an end-to-end trained DNN controlled autonomous vehicle. The attack is initiated by installing a billboard displaying videos on the roadside to incoming DNN controlled vehicles so that the vehicle tracks an adversary customized trajectory. The billboard contains an integrated camera to enable estimation of the pose of the approaching vehicle. The dynamic billboard images (i.e., a video) continuously adapt to the vehicle's relative pose with respect to the billboard while being robust to variations in lighting, view angle, and weather. The attack's effectiveness is shown on a recently developed off-the-shelf high-fidelity simulator, CARLA, for autonomous vehicles. CARLA utilizes an end-to-end learning-based autonomous navigation system. The proposed approach is applicable to other end-to-end trained autonomous cyber-physical systems.  © 2000-2011 IEEE.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85113222556&doi=10.1109%2fTITS.2021.3103441&partnerID=40&md5=7dbdf9a9f44bb3bddd13159554762649,IEEE Transactions on Intelligent Transportation Systems,2022
Risk Adversarial Learning System for Connected and Autonomous Vehicle Charging,"In this article, the design of a rational decision support system (RDSS) for a connected and autonomous vehicle charging infrastructure (CAV-CI) is studied. In the considered CAV-CI, the distribution system operator (DSO) deploys electric vehicle supply equipment (EVSE) to provide an electrical vehicle (EV) charging facility for human-driven connected vehicles (CVs) and AVs. The charging request by the human-driven EV becomes irrational when it demands more energy and charging period than its actual need. Therefore, the scheduling policy of each EVSE must be adaptively accumulated the irrational charging request to satisfy the charging demand of both CVs and autonomous vehicles (AVs). To tackle this, we formulate an RDSS problem for the DSO, where the objective is to maximize the charging capacity utilization by satisfying the laxity risk of the DSO. Thus, we devise a rational reward maximization problem to adapt the irrational behavior by CVs in a data-informed manner. We propose a novel risk adversarial multiagent learning system (RAMALS) for CAV-CI to solve the formulated RDSS problem. In RAMALS, the DSO acts as a centralized risk adversarial agent (RAA) for informing the laxity risk to each EVSE. Subsequently, each EVSE plays the role of a self-learner agent to adaptively schedule its own EV sessions by coping advice from RAA. The experiment results show that the proposed RAMALS affords around 46.6% improvement in charging rate, about 28.6% improvement in the EVSE's active charging time, and at least 33.3% more energy utilization, as compared to a currently deployed ACN EVSE system, and other baselines. © 2014 IEEE.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85124238726&doi=10.1109%2fJIOT.2022.3149038&partnerID=40&md5=65ffb3afd253b66778bdcbdfc037a812,IEEE Internet of Things Journal,2022
A Shared Representation for Photorealistic Driving Simulators,"A powerful simulator highly decreases the need for real-world tests when training and evaluating autonomous vehicles. Data-driven simulators flourished with the recent advancement of conditional Generative Adversarial Networks (cGANs), providing high-fidelity images. The main challenge is synthesizing photorealistic images while following given constraints. In this work, we propose to improve the quality of generated images by rethinking the discriminator architecture. The focus is on the class of problems where images are generated given semantic inputs, such as scene segmentation maps or human body poses. We build on successful cGAN models to propose a new semantically-aware discriminator that better guides the generator. We aim to learn a shared latent representation that encodes enough information to jointly do semantic segmentation, content reconstruction, along with a coarse-to-fine grained adversarial reasoning. The achieved improvements are generic and simple enough to be applied to any architecture of conditional image synthesis. We demonstrate the strength of our method on the scene, building, and human synthesis tasks across three different datasets.

Beamforming Design and Performance Analysis for Satellite and UAV Integrated Networks in IoRT Applications,"Satellite and unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) integrated networks (SUINs) are considered as a promising method to offer various Internet of Remote Things (IoRT) applications. In this article, we investigate the downlink transmission of SUINs where the satellite-to-UAV link uses the free-space optical (FSO) technology with an equal gain combining (EGC) scheme while the links from UAV to IoRT devices exploit radio frequency (RF) with the space-division multiple access (SDMA) technique. Specifically, considering that only statistical channel state information (CSI) is available, we first formulate an optimization problem to maximize the ergodic sum rate (ESR) of the system, which is constrained by the total transmit power budget and IoRT devices' rate requirements. Then, a beamforming (BF) scheme based on the alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM) is proposed to solve the nonconvex problem. Furthermore, a zero-forcing (ZF)-based suboptimal approach is also presented to reduce the implementation complexity. Finally, by assuming that the FSO link and RF links are subject to Gamma-Gamma fading and Nakagami- m fading, respectively, we derive closed-form ESR expressions for the considered network with the proposed BF schemes. Simulation results are provided to confirm the accuracy of the theoretical analysis. Moreover, it is revealed that our proposed EGC scheme for FSO communication and BF schemes for RF transmission can both achieve better performance than the existing works.  © 2014 IEEE.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85129663739&doi=10.1109%2fJIOT.2022.3170429&partnerID=40&md5=32c1bddf8c34706e0ddbdc1ff3e4fce5,IEEE Internet of Things Journal,2022
Dynamic-Detection-Based Trajectory Planning for Autonomous Underwater Vehicle to Collect Data From Underwater Sensors,"Marine science and Internet of Underwater Things applications rely significantly on collecting data from underwater sensors. Data collection using long-distance underwater acoustic communications consumes a lot of energy in underwater sensor nodes, which are powered by batteries. To achieve low-energy consumption, we can use the autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV) to move close to sensor nodes and exploit the short-range and high-rate communications. Most of the existing AUV-based data collection schemes consider the scenarios having the knowledge of node positions, where the cruising trajectory can be computed before the AUV's departure. These schemes cannot apply to some scenarios such as turtle tracking for a certain sea area having no position information. To this end, we first propose a planning-while-detecting approach to dynamically detect the sensors on turtles and adjust the AUV cruising direction to collect data. To further improve data efficiency under the energy limit of the AUV, we group the sensors that can share the same trajectory using their detected directions. A grouping-based dynamic trajectory planning (GDTP) is then proposed to determine the next cruising direction that can visit the group of sensors having the largest amount of data and demanding the least cruising energy at the risk of detection errors. Simulation results show that GDTP achieves significantly higher data collection efficiency than the existing trajectory planning algorithms in dynamic scenarios, and as the communication range increases, it can even outperform the existing algorithms with node locations.  © 2014 IEEE.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85123273390&doi=10.1109%2fJIOT.2022.3141402&partnerID=40&md5=3b06c6354a3e1dadf635a5274ee76939,IEEE Internet of Things Journal,2022
Machine Learning-Empowered Beam Management for mmWave-NOMA in Multi-UAVs Networks,"We consider a mission-driven multiple unmanned aerial vehicles (multi-UAVs) network with millimeter-wave (mmWave) transmissions, where a leader UAV (LUAV) communicates with a large number of follower UAVs (FUAVs) simultaneously via a uniform planar array with only a limited number of radio frequency chains. Since only a few orthogonal beams are available and mission-driven UAV networks are autonomous and delay-sensitive, non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) over these beams is considered for agility and efficiency. In particular, aiming to address these challenges of highly dynamic mobility, we propose a machine learning framework to enable agile analog beam management for mmWave-NOMA transmissions. The proposed beam management aims to achieve efficient beam tracking and NOMA-grouping-aware analog beamforming optimization to facilitate mmWave-NOMA transmissions by judiciously utilizing angular domain information (ADI). More specifically, a Gaussian process machine learning-based ADI prediction scheme is proposed to track the angular dynamics of FUAVs, which facilitates fast beam-tracking for mmWave-NOMA transmissions. Moreover, by exploiting the predicted ADI, an unsupervised-learning-based FUAV grouping scheme is proposed to facilitate mmWave-NOMA transmissions with high radio-frequency chain efficiency, while a deep learning-based NOMA-grouping-aware fast transmit beamforming optimization scheme is proposed to improve the coverage of mmWave-NOMA transmissions in highly dynamic multi-UAVs networks. Simulation results validate the performance advantages of our proposed beam management scheme against state-of-the-art schemes. © 1967-2012 IEEE.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85132524090&doi=10.1109%2fTVT.2022.3172443&partnerID=40&md5=d0c37f7d139917c9bc4b8384bf4515fc,IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology,2022
A global thermo-mechanical model to mitigate welding residual stress and deformation in production of an aluminum bio-inspired AUV with a curved outside corner joint,"Welding mechanics of large-scale complex-shaped structures is generally either disregarded or implicitly presumed due to high complexity and time consumption — even in the case of numerical analysis, typically it is limited to local thermo-mechanical models of straight butt or tee welded joints. Nevertheless, not only is this study aimed at presenting a time-saving global thermo-mechanical model of a curved outside corner joint but also at exploiting combined effects of welding parameters to mitigate deformation and residual stress. The global thermo-mechanical model is thereby constructed by combination of shell and solid finite elements providing Thermal-Elastic-Plastic (TEP) analysis for an aluminum Autonomous Underwater Vehicle (AUV) of which novel hull shape inspired by catfish morphology results in a longitudinal curved outside corner welded joint. A suitable polynomial mathematical function enabled the welding heat source to move steadily along the curved path of the joint. Saving up computational time 3.5 times greater than conventional full 3D method, the global shell/3D TEP FEM is validated well against experimental temperature, distortion and residual stress distributions when locating the boundary between shell and solid elements with the size of solid zone up to the 3 times thickness of base metal based on accuracy of molten metal penetration, deformation and residual stress prediction. A stark difference of about 120% in maximum amount of longitudinal residual stress is observed between global and local models. Finally, optimal outcomes are employed in production of the AUV so that 33% reduction in welding speed mitigated residual stress by 22% whereas welding length and sequence were more effective on distortion. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85132532018&doi=10.1016%2fj.oceaneng.2022.111612&partnerID=40&md5=9c39f4a3ffc8f83efd5851ddf6e47076,Ocean Engineering,2022
An Inverse Reinforcement Learning Approach for Customizing Automated Lane Change Systems,"Vehicle automation seeks to enhance road safety and improve the driving experience. However, a standard system does not account for variations in users and driving conditions. Customizing vehicle automation based on users’ preferences aims to improve the user experience and adoption of the technologies. This study introduces a systematic paradigm that starts with naturalistic driving data to identify the driving behaviors and styles for a customized automated lane change system. The driving behaviors are first extracted using Multivariate Functional Principal Component Analysis (MFPCA) with minimum prior expert knowledge. The driving styles are identified by clustering the extracted driving behaviors. An Inverse Reinforcement Learning (IRL) algorithm is then used to train the automated lane change system from grouped demonstrations of the identified driving styles to capture the preferences of a group of drivers with a similar driving style. The performance of the proposed customized automated lane change system is compared to (1) a non-customized system trained on all the sample trips, (2) customized systems built on expert-coded reward functions, and (3) customized systems trained using a Generative Adversarial Imitation Learning (GAIL) algorithm. The results show that our method outperforms all the other systems with respect to the prediction accuracy of the lane change actions. Additionally, our method gains insights on the representative behaviors of different driving styles to enable customization of automated lane change systems. © 2022 IEEE.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85131749705&doi=10.1109%2fTVT.2022.3179332&partnerID=40&md5=a11535c758fcf44853e92b6b743b1f73,IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology,2022
Efficient Federated Learning With Spike Neural Networks for Traffic Sign Recognition,"With the gradual popularization of self-driving, it is becoming increasingly important for vehicles to smartly make the right driving decisions and autonomously obey traffic rules by correctly recognizing traffic signs. However, for machine learning-based traffic sign recognition on the Internet of Vehicles (IoV), a large amount of traffic sign data from distributed vehicles is needed to be gathered in a centralized server for model training, which brings serious privacy leakage risk because of traffic sign data containing lots of location privacy information. To address this issue, we first exploit privacy-preserving federated learning to perform collaborative training for accurate recognition models without sharing raw traffic sign data. Nevertheless, due to the limited computing and energy resources of most devices, it is hard for vehicles to continuously undertake complex artificial intelligence tasks. Therefore, we introduce powerful Spike Neural Networks (SNNs) into traffic sign recognition for energy-efficient and fast model training, which is the next generation of neural networks and is practical and well-fitted to IoV scenarios. Furthermore, we design a novel encoding scheme for SNNs based on neuron receptive fields to extract information from the pixel and spatial dimensions of traffic signs to achieve high-accuracy training. Numerical results indicate that the proposed federated SNN outperforms traditional federated convolutional neural networks in terms of accuracy, noise immunity, and energy efficiency as well. © 2022 IEEE.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85131741378&doi=10.1109%2fTVT.2022.3178808&partnerID=40&md5=76759221793b91dae37c5bb29da06a44,IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology,2022
Congestion-Aware Multi-Drone Delivery Routing Framework,"Drones have been attracting the attention of diverse industries thanks to their superior maneuverability. Logistics companies especially keep trying to utilize drones for fast delivery following the growing market size of e-commerce. Accordingly, methods for safely operating multi-drone have been researched, and many researchers have proposed various optimal or near-optimal routing methods. However, such methods have some problems that cause routing failures or huge routing computation time in a drone-dense space due to many collisions. In this paper, we propose a centralized framework that deals with enormous collisions and obtains collision-free paths rapidly. We first build a drone energy consumption model with a data-driven method using flight experiment data of a commercial drone to estimate the drone battery state-of-charge (SoC). Then, we develop a novel routing method that generates collision-free paths by considering both the congestion of the space and the SoC of each drone. The proposed method is inspired by the VLSI circuit routing method that connects all signal nets among thousands of logic components. Through numerous delivery routing simulations, we confirm that the proposed method achieves a maximum of 6 times higher routing success rate with a 10x faster runtime compared with the state-of-the-art optimal method. In addition, we validate that the proposed method is applicable to delivery routing problems with various drone battery capacities. © 2022 IEEE.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85131764580&doi=10.1109%2fTVT.2022.3179732&partnerID=40&md5=bf37feaea0ddd6035e22bdc48dc08b99,IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology,2022
AUV-Aided Data Importance Based Scheme for Protecting Location Privacy in Smart Ocean,"Data collection in underwater acoustic sensor networks (UASNs) and the exposure of node location information pose a threat to the security of the entire network. Therefore, the main challenge for underwater acoustic sensor network security is to protect the security and privacy of the node locations. Compared to active attacks, the characteristics of passive attacks are indistinguishable. Therefore, this research focuses on passive attacks in underwater acoustic sensor networks, and an autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV)-aided data-importance-based scheme for protecting location privacy (DIS-PLP) is proposed. The DIS-PLP comprises three main parts. First, the anchor node calculates the importance of the current data based on the historical dataset and decides whether to send data packets to the base station according to the importance result. Subsequently, an AUV privacy violation is defined, and an AUV path planning method is proposed to prevent attackers from tracking the AUV to obtain the location of the source node. Finally, to prevent nodes from waiting too long for AUVs, a secure multi-hop transmission method is proposed that uses fake source nodes to send fake source data packets to hide the real traffic. The simulation results show that the DIS-PLP offers well performance in terms of safety time and delay, which has strong practical significance for Smart Ocean to improve the level of network security. © 2022 IEEE.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85139432019&doi=10.1109%2fTVT.2022.3178379&partnerID=40&md5=3234c380f764de73ba387187830ceeff,IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology,2022
Federated Feature Selection for Cyber-Physical Systems of Systems,"Autonomous vehicles (AVs) generate a massive amount of multi-modal data that once collected and processed through Machine Learning algorithms, enable AI-based services at the Edge. In fact, only a subset of the collected data present informative attributes to be exploited at the Edge. Therefore, extracting such a subset is of utmost importance to limit computation and communication workloads. Doing that in a distributed manner imposes the AVs to cooperate in finding an agreement on which attributes should be sent to the Edge. In this work, we address such a problem by proposing a federated feature selection (FFS) algorithm where the AVs collaborate to filter out, iteratively, the less relevant attributes in a distributed manner, without any exchange of raw data, thought two different components: a Mutual-Information-based feature selection algorithm run by the AVs and a novel aggregation function based on the Bayes theorem executed on the Edge. The FFS algorithm has been tested on two reference datasets: MAV with images and inertial measurements of a monitored vehicle, WESAD with a collection of samples from biophysical sensors to monitor a relative passenger. The numerical results show that the AVs converge to a minimum achievable subset of features with both the datasets, i.e., 24 out of 2166 (99%) in MAV and 4 out of 8 (50%) in WESAD, respectively, preserving the informative content of data. © 2022 IEEE.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85134712873&doi=10.1109%2fTVT.2022.3178612&partnerID=40&md5=ef1bbeed4231dab4033c2cc4c68e9dfa,IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology,2022

Secure Privacy-Preserving V2V Communication in 5G-V2X Supporting Network Slicing,"As autonomous driving technology continues to develop, communication for vehicles is becoming more important to provide an efficient and secure driving environment. Currently, vehicle-to-everything (V2X) based on fifth-generation (5G) is the only solution to meet the demanding requirements of self-driving cars in terms of ultra-low latency and ultra-high reliable connectivity under high mobility conditions, earning this technology more attention. Secure communication for vehicle-to-vehicle based on 5G (5G-V2V) is essential because vehicles decide how to maneuver and perceive situations based on the data exchanged. In this paper, we not only propose a new architecture for V2X based on 5G (5G-V2X) by utilizing network slicing (NS) to guarantee different features of V2X services but also analyze security requirements according to V2X service type. We also propose a secure V2V communication scheme based on 5G that satisfies these requirements. The security evaluation demonstrates that our scheme is secure against attacks on a V2V environment via both security proof and verification tool ProVerif. Through the performance evaluation, we prove that our scheme is more effective than the existing schemes while meeting end-to-end delay requirements for autonomous driving.  © 2000-2011 IEEE.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85139137588&doi=10.1109%2fTITS.2021.3129484&partnerID=40&md5=d16f9f0c720e0dbcd0228f9e082551ea,IEEE Transactions on Intelligent Transportation Systems,2022
Cooperative Computation Offloading in Blockchain-Based Vehicular Edge Computing Networks,"As a novel computing paradigm, multiaccess edge computing (MEC) migrates computing and storage capabilities to edge nodes of the network to meet the requirements of executing computationally intensive or delay-sensitive tasks on intelligent vehicles. In addition, MEC fills the gap between cloud computing and terminals in vehicular networks. In the MEC system, to reduce the load on MEC servers with large-scale vehicle deployment and promote the efficient use of network resources, vehicles can also transfer tasks to neighboring resource-rich vehicles using cooperative computation offloading. However, cooperative computation offloading between vehicles faces the challenges of security and insufficient information about the server vehicle. Therefore, this paper proposes using blockchain technology to achieve efficient data sharing between vehicles and service providers (i.e., server vehicles) and ensure the security of computation offloading between vehicles. First, we design a secure data sharing architecture in blockchain-based vehicular edge computing networks. Then, a new consensus mechanism in this architecture is proposed to improve the efficiency of data sharing and prevent malicious attacks. Furthermore, we present a cooperative offloading decision-making method using an offloading game, and the Nash equilibrium of the offloading strategy is achieved using this method. The results of numerical experiments demonstrate the superior performance of the proposed method.  © 2016 IEEE.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85134351363&doi=10.1109%2fTIV.2022.3190308&partnerID=40&md5=00d72767d41ba0388e22762f5aaa6318,IEEE Transactions on Intelligent Vehicles,2022
Predictive compensator based event-triggered model predictive control with nonlinear disturbance observer for unmanned surface vehicle under cyber-attacks,"The trajectory tracking problem of unmanned surface vehicles (USVs) with external disturbances and input constraints, under denial of service (DoS) is addressed in this paper. We propose a predictive compensator based event-triggered model predictive control with nonlinear disturbance observer (PC-ETMPC with NDO) strategy. A model predictive controller (MPC) based on a nominal USV model is combined with a nonlinear disturbance observer (NDO) to estimate and compensate external disturbances. A predictive compensator (PC) is used to compensate network attack signals, which reduces the adverse impact of cyber-attack on the system, and an event-triggered mechanism is used to save computational resources of the calculation of the MPC. The proposed strategy is feasible for implementation, and its stability is proved to ensure the stable operation of the system. Numerical simulations and comparison are performed to demonstrate the effectiveness and superiority of the proposed control strategy. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85134293437&doi=10.1016%2fj.oceaneng.2022.111868&partnerID=40&md5=ebe2145953851f5f2bcad9be86815242,Ocean Engineering,2022
Second-Order-Optimal Filter on Lie Groups for Planar Rigid Bodies,"Attitude estimation is a core problem in many mobile robotic systems, such as unmanned aerial and ground vehicles. The configuration space of these systems is properly modeled by exploiting the theory of Lie groups. In this article, we propose a second-order-optimal minimum-energy filter on the matrix Lie group TSE(2), the tangent bundle of the special Euclidean group SE(2), where the optimality is with respect to a cost function in the unknown input and output error measurements. In this article, the measurement equation consists of a global positioning system-like device with two antennas attached to the planar rigid body and an inertial measurement unit-like device. Even though the mathematics is quite complicated, the accuracy of the filter justifies this approach. Simulations show the effectiveness of the proposed filter.  © 1963-2012 IEEE.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85131715001&doi=10.1109%2fTAC.2022.3179988&partnerID=40&md5=3601505cf3b938ce2d0e4127c9347764,IEEE Transactions on Automatic Control,2022
An internet of secure and private things: A service-oriented architecture,"Low-cost networked IoT devices are fast becoming commonplace. From implanted medical devices to motion-activated surveillance cameras and from driverless smart cars to voice-operated home management systems, IoT devices continue to permeate further and deeper into our lives. However, this widespread adoption of IoT devices has also given rise to a wide range of security, privacy and trust issues that are unique to the IoT ecosystem. Conventional solutions are ill-suited for the IoT domain due to limited resources, network dynamics, and evolving trust boundaries. Hence, novel mechanisms are needed to address the specific challenges of the IoT landscape. To this end, we propose a user-centric cloud-based service that allows device owners to have fine-grained control over what kind and how much data is shared through their IoT devices. Our scheme builds on top of Intel Software Guard Extensions (SGX) to instantiate secure virtual clones (shadows) of actual devices in the cloud, substantially reducing the attack surface for IoT networks. Furthermore, a scalable infrastructure in the cloud allows us to deploy sophisticated policy enforcement and data scrubbing mechanisms on a per application basis giving users explicit control over data sharing. The presented approach requires little effort on part of device vendors and users as the service provider handles the bulk of the work. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach empirically by implementing the service on SGX hardware and deploying advanced data cleansing policies on device-generated data. © 2022",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85131968676&doi=10.1016%2fj.cose.2022.102776&partnerID=40&md5=78495d346d2636b78b2cafac78ee6b28,Computers and Security,2022
Real-Time Scheduling of Autonomous Mining Trucks via Flow Allocation-Accelerated Tabu Search,"Material transportation is an essential process in mining operations and accounts for a large portion of total energy consumption. With the development of automation technology, autonomous mining trucks have been deployed in open-pit mines to reduce transportation costs. Compared to manned mining trucks, autonomous trucks are more appropriate for automatic scheduling techniques due to their high informatization, high-precision perception, and sophisticated control. However, the existing truck scheduling research does not exploit autonomous trucks' strengths to perform more delicate control, but still takes a traditional approach toward autonomous trucks. In this paper, we propose a mixed-integer programming model for joint optimization of autonomous trucks trips and speeds to minimize energy consumption. To solve the proposed scheduling model, a novel tabu search algorithm is proposed, which consists of two parts: an improved flow allocation model with matching factor is formulated in the upper part to determine the optimal truck flow, and in the lower part a tabu search procedure guided with the optimal flow is developed. Based on the mathematical model and solution technique, we also propose a real-time scheduling system of autonomous trucks for the stochastic and dynamic mining environment. A coal mine in Inner Mongolia, China, for example, we verified the effectiveness of the proposed truck scheduling model and real-time scheduling approach. We demonstrate that the proposed allocation model effectively accelerates the tabu search procedure, and for short-term decisions, the proposed solution technique satisfies the computational requirements of the real-time scheduling system.  © 2016 IEEE.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85128621285&doi=10.1109%2fTIV.2022.3166564&partnerID=40&md5=bdb780701a37a5957289f9e34f49e6a4,IEEE Transactions on Intelligent Vehicles,2022
Blockchain-Assisted Distributed and Lightweight Authentication Service for Industrial Unmanned Aerial Vehicles,"Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) have shown great potential in benefiting industries due to their good features, such as the ease of deployment and low maintenance cost. However, the communication security issue remains a serious challenge before the large-scale application of industrial UAVs. The untrusted communication environment can cause the leakage of valuable industrial data or the losing of important cargos that carried by UAVs. Traditional authentication mechanisms for protecting communications include public-key infrastructure-based, ID-based, and certificateless authentication. These mechanisms rely on a central authority and some of them may introduce high-complexity computation that is not suitable for industrial drones. Therefore, aiming at these challenges, we design a blockchain-assisted distributed and lightweight authentication service for industrial UAVs. The blockchain technology supports the distributed and immutable storage of industrial UAVs' authentication information, and smart contracts enable convenient operations for drones to acquire or update the corresponding information. Security evaluation demonstrates that our scheme is resistant to various attacks and can guarantee trustworthy communications for industrial drones. Extensive experiments also show that our designed authentication service can not only achieve low computation and communication cost for industrial UAVs but also remain robust even if a small proportion of drones are compromised.  © 2014 IEEE.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85123301375&doi=10.1109%2fJIOT.2022.3142251&partnerID=40&md5=f16fa7695722817f3ef1c40eed9d77a0,IEEE Internet of Things Journal,2022
Certifiable Robustness to Adversarial State Uncertainty in Deep Reinforcement Learning,"Deep neural network-based systems are now state-of-the-art in many robotics tasks, but their application in safety-critical domains remains dangerous without formal guarantees on network robustness. Small perturbations to sensor inputs (from noise or adversarial examples) are often enough to change network-based decisions, which was recently shown to cause an autonomous vehicle to swerve into another lane. In light of these dangers, numerous algorithms have been developed as defensive mechanisms from these adversarial inputs, some of which provide formal robustness guarantees or certificates. This work leverages research on certified adversarial robustness to develop an online certifiably robust for deep reinforcement learning algorithms. The proposed defense computes guaranteed lower bounds on state-action values during execution to identify and choose a robust action under a worst case deviation in input space due to possible adversaries or noise. Moreover, the resulting policy comes with a certificate of solution quality, even though the true state and optimal action are unknown to the certifier due to the perturbations. The approach is demonstrated on a deep Q-network (DQN) policy and is shown to increase robustness to noise and adversaries in pedestrian collision avoidance scenarios, a classic control task, and Atari Pong. This article extends our prior work with new performance guarantees, extensions to other reinforcement learning algorithms, expanded results aggregated across more scenarios, an extension into scenarios with adversarial behavior, comparisons with a more computationally expensive method, and visualizations that provide intuition about the robustness algorithm.  © 2012 IEEE.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85100951714&doi=10.1109%2fTNNLS.2021.3056046&partnerID=40&md5=d55a48b8c4f0aa2224cf3ff6598bf188,IEEE Transactions on Neural Networks and Learning Systems,2022
A Semidistributed Interior Point Algorithm for Optimal Coordination of Automated Vehicles at Intersections,"In this article, we consider the optimal coordination of automated vehicles at intersections under fixed crossing orders. We formulate the problem using direct optimal control and exploit the structure to construct a semidistributed primal-dual interior-point algorithm to solve it by parallelizing most of the computations. Differently from standard distributed optimization algorithms, where the optimization problem is split, in our approach we split the linear algebra steps, such that the algorithm takes the same steps as a fully centralized one, while still performing computations in a distributed fashion. We analyze the communication requirements of the algorithm, and propose an approximation scheme which can significantly reduce the data exchange. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the algorithm in hard but realistic scenarios, which show that the approximation leads to reductions in communicated data of almost 99% of the exact formulation, at the expense of less than 1% suboptimality.  © 1993-2012 IEEE.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85122085252&doi=10.1109%2fTCST.2021.3132835&partnerID=40&md5=d3b3771fd0da7bd6814460590cb04104,IEEE Transactions on Control Systems Technology,2022
A Privacy-Preserving-Based Secure Framework Using Blockchain-Enabled Deep-Learning in Cooperative Intelligent Transport System,"Cooperative Intelligent Transport System (C-ITS) is a promising technology that aims to improve the traditional transport management systems. In C-ITS infrastructure Autonomous Vehicles (AVs) communicate wirelessly with other AVs, Road Side Units (RSUs) and Traffic Command Centres (TCCs) using an open channel Internet. However, the use of the Internet brings inherent vulnerabilities related to privacy (e.g., adversary performing inference and data poisoning attacks), and security (e.g., AVs can be compromised using advanced hacking techniques) issues and prevents the faster realization of C-ITS applications. To address these challenges, this paper presents a privacy-preserving-based secure framework to provide both privacy and security in C-ITS infrastructure. The proposed framework provides two level of security and privacy using blockchain and deep learning modules. First, a blockchain module is designed to securely transmit the C-ITS data between AVs-RSUs-TCCs, and a smart contract-based enhanced Proof of Work (ePoW) technique is designed to verify data integrity and mitigate data poisoning attacks. Second, a deep-learning module is designed that includes Long-Short Term Memory-AutoEncoder (LSTM-AE) technique for encoding C-ITS data into a new format to prevent inference attacks. The encoded data is used by the proposed Attention-based Recurrent Neural Network (A-RNN), for intrusive events recognition in C-ITS infrastructure. The proposed A-RNN is trained using Truncated Backpropagation Through Time (BPTT) algorithm. The framework is further validated and tested using two publicly available ToN-IoT and CICIDS-2017 datasets. The proposed framework is compared with peer privacy-preserving intrusion detection techniques, and the result shows the effectiveness of the proposed framework over several state-of-the-art techniques in both blockchain and non-blockchain systems.  © 2000-2011 IEEE.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85112653058&doi=10.1109%2fTITS.2021.3098636&partnerID=40&md5=c3f906a9d6e41fab58a6ed2e12369add,IEEE Transactions on Intelligent Transportation Systems,2022
3D Vehicle Detection Using Multi-Level Fusion From Point Clouds and Images,"3D vehicle detectors based on point clouds generally have higher detection performance than detectors based on multi-sensors. However, with the lack of texture information, point-based methods get many missing detection of occluded and distant vehicles, and false detection with high-confidence of similarly shaped objects, which is a potential threat to traffic safety. Therefore, in the long run, fusion-based methods have more potential. This paper presents a multi-level fusion network for 3D vehicle detection from point clouds and images. The fusion network includes three stages: data-level fusion of point clouds and images, feature-level fusion of voxel and Bird's Eye View (BEV) in the point cloud branch, and feature-level fusion of point clouds and images. Besides, a novel coarse-fine detection header is proposed, which simulates the two-stage detectors, generating coarse proposals on the encoder, and refining them on the decoder. Extensive experiments show that the proposed network has better detection performance on occluded and distant vehicles, and reduces the false detection of similarly shaped objects, proving its superiority over some state-of-the-art detectors on the challenging KITTI benchmark. Ablation studies have also demonstrated the effectiveness of each designed module.  © 2000-2011 IEEE.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85123356538&doi=10.1109%2fTITS.2021.3137392&partnerID=40&md5=948f8eccf87ae158ecf82875d7e64d94,IEEE Transactions on Intelligent Transportation Systems,2022

Delay and Reliability-Constrained VNF Placement on Mobile and Volatile 5G Infrastructure,"Ongoing research and industrial exploitation of SDN and NFV technologies promise higher flexibility on network automation and infrastructure optimization. Choosing the location of Virtual Network Functions is a central problem in the automation and optimization of the software-defined, virtualization-based next generation of networks such as 5G and beyond. Network services provided for autonomous vehicles, factory automation, e-health and cloud robotics often require strict delay bounds and reliability constraints influenced by the location of its composing Virtual Network Functions. Robots, vehicles and other end-devices provide significant capabilities such as actuators, sensors and local computation which are essential for some services. Moreover, these devices are continuously on the move and might lose network connection or run out of battery, which further challenge service delivery in this dynamic environment. This work tackles the mobility, and battery restrictions; as well as the temporal aspects and conflicting traits of reliable, low latency service deployment over a volatile network, where mobile compute nodes act as an extension of the cloud and edge computing infrastructure. The problem is formulated as a cost-minimizing Virtual Network Function placement optimization and an efficient heuristic is proposed.

Survey on Cooperative Perception in an Automotive Context,"The idea of cooperation has been introduced to self-driving cars about a decade ago with the aim to reduce the occlusion caused by other users or the scene. More recently, the research efforts turned toward cooperative infrastructure bringing a new kind of the point of view as well as more processing power. This paper lies in this new field providing a survey that addresses the cooperative environment. We provide an overview of the architectures available to create such a system as well as the challenges introduced by the cooperation. Later, we review the main blocks involved in the perception: localization, object detection & tracking, map generation. Each block is reviewed under the prism of cooperation. We also provide a Strengths, Weaknesses, Opportunities, and Threats (SWOT) analysis of the cooperative perception as well as a list of related scenarios alongside experimentations.

Fortifying Smart Transportation Security Through Public Blockchain,"Smart vehicles-enabled intelligent transportation system (ITS) supports a wide range of applications, such as, but not limited to, traffic planning and management, collision avoidance alert system, automated road speed enforcement, electronic toll collection, and real-time parking management, to name a few. However, it suffers from various types of security and privacy issues due to insecure communication among the entities over public channels. Therefore, an efficient and lightweight security mechanism is essential to protect the data that is both at rest as well as in transit. To this direction, we propose a public blockchain-envisioned secure communication framework for ITS (PBSCF-ITS). The proposed PBSCF-ITS guarantees access control and key management among the vehicle to vehicle, vehicle to roadside unit, and roadside unit to cloud server. We analyze the security of PBSCF-ITS to prove its resilience against various types of possible attacks. Furthermore, the performance of PBSCF-ITS with other related competing schemes has been compared. The obtained results illustrate that PBSCF-ITS outperforms the existing ones. Additionally, the pragmatic study of PBSCF-ITS is conducted to check its influence on various network-related performance parameters, like the number of mined blocks and transactions per block.  © 2022 IEEE.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85124708401&doi=10.1109%2fJIOT.2022.3150842&partnerID=40&md5=21ad2b6f670e5f332415868a5ad3733c,IEEE Internet of Things Journal,2022
Fast-HBNet: Hybrid Branch Network for Fast Lane Detection,"As one of the fundamental visual tasks in the unmanned driving area, lane detection attracts increasing attention. In practical applications, lane points are very difficult to localize because they usually appear to be sparse and incomplete due to the influence of illumination and environment. Conventional lane detection methods rely on coarse features and carefully designed postprocessing to detect the lane lines. However, these methods are usually slow, and the stability and generalization ability are unsatisfactory. In this paper, we propose a novel lane detection network - Fast-HBNet(Fast-Hybrid Branch Network), which exploits both global semantic information and spatial contexts. To enlarge receptive fields and encode more detailed information, the compound transformation is employed and the proposed hybrid branch network extracts four diverse feature maps with different receptive fields and spatial contexts. Besides, we design a Hierarchical Feature Learning (HFL) module to learn lane features from the scale, channel, and spatial levels to enhance the generalization ability of our detector. These features are further selectively coalesced to generate unified lane feature maps with large receptive fields and rich detailed information. In other words, our network can encode the global semantic information from the high-resolution feature maps and the fine-grained details in the low-resolution feature maps. Experimental results conducted on the TuSimple (2017) and CULane [Pan et al. (2018)] datasets demonstrate that the proposed Fast-HBNet outperforms numerous state-of-the-art lane detectors in both speed and accuracy. Particularly, Fast-HBNet achieves an accuracy of 96.88% on the TuSimple dataset at a speed of 76 FPS.  © 2000-2011 IEEE.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85124202475&doi=10.1109%2fTITS.2022.3145018&partnerID=40&md5=6dc6888a20b4c4739748ba950e515063,IEEE Transactions on Intelligent Transportation Systems,2022
Spatio-Contextual Deep Network-Based Multimodal Pedestrian Detection for Autonomous Driving,"Pedestrian Detection is the most critical module of an Autonomous Driving system. Although a camera is commonly used for this purpose, its quality degrades severely in low-light night time driving scenarios. On the other hand, the quality of a thermal camera image remains unaffected in similar conditions. This paper proposes an end-to-end multimodal fusion model for pedestrian detection using RGB and thermal images. Its novel spatio-contextual deep network architecture is capable of exploiting the multimodal input efficiently. It consists of two distinct deformable ResNeXt-50 encoders for feature extraction from the two modalities. Fusion of these two encoded features takes place inside a multimodal feature embedding module (MuFEm) consisting of several groups of a pair of Graph Attention Network and a feature fusion unit. The output of the last feature fusion unit of MuFEm is subsequently passed to two CRFs for their spatial refinement. Further enhancement of the features is achieved by applying channel-wise attention and extraction of contextual information with the help of four RNNs traversing in four different directions. Finally, these feature maps are used by a single-stage decoder to generate the bounding box of each pedestrian and the score map. We have performed extensive experiments of the proposed framework on three publicly available multimodal pedestrian detection benchmark datasets, namely KAIST, CVC-14, and UTokyo. The results on each of them improved the respective state-of-the-art performance.

Resilient Cooperative Adaptive Cruise Control for Autonomous Vehicles Using Machine Learning,"Cooperative Adaptive Cruise Control (CACC) is a fundamental connected vehicle application that extends Adaptive Cruise Control by exploiting vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) communication. CACC is a crucial ingredient for numerous autonomous vehicle functionalities including platooning, distributed route management, etc. Unfortunately, malicious V2V communications can subvert CACC, leading to string instability and road accidents.

RACCON uses machine learning to develop an on-board prediction model that captures anomalous vehicular responses and performs mitigation in real time.

Moving objects segmentation using generative adversarial modeling,"Moving Objects Segmentation (MOS) is a crucial step in various computer vision applications, such as visual object tracking, autonomous vehicles, human activity analysis, surveillance, and security. Existing MOS approaches suffer from performance degradation due to extreme challenging conditions in real world complex environments such as varying illumination conditions, camouflage objects, dynamic backgrounds, shadows, bad weathers and camera jitters. To address these problems we proposed a novel generative adversarial based framework for moving objects segmentation. Our framework works with one classifier discriminator, one representation learning network and one generator jointly trained to perform MOS in various challenging scenarios. During training the discriminator network acts as a decision maker between real and fake training samples using conditional least squares loss. While the representation learning network provides the difference between the deep features of real and fake training samples using content loss formulation. Another loss term we have exploited to train our generator network is the reconstruction loss that minimizes the difference between the spatial information of real and fake training samples. Moreover, we also propose a novel modified U-net architecture for our generator network showing improved performance over Vanilla U-net model.

Machine-Learning-Based 3-D Channel Modeling for U2V mmWave Communications,"Unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) millimeter wave (mmWave) technologies can provide flexible link and high data rate for future communication networks. By considering the new features of three-dimensional (3-D) scattering space, 3-D velocity, 3-D antenna array, and especially 3-D rotations, a machine learning (ML)-integrated UAV-to-Vehicle (U2V) mmWave channel model is proposed. Meanwhile, an ML-based network for channel parameter calculation and generation is developed. The deterministic parameters are calculated based on the simplified geometry information, while the random ones are generated by the backpropagation-based neural network (BPNN) and generative adversarial network (GAN), where the training data set is obtained from massive ray-tracing (RT) simulations. Moreover, theoretical expressions of channel statistical properties, i.e., power delay profile (PDP), autocorrelation function (ACF), Doppler power spectrum density (DPSD), and cross-correlation function (CCF), are derived and analyzed. Finally, the U2V mmWave channel is generated under a typical urban scenario at 28 GHz. The generated PDP and DPSD show good agreement with RT-based results, which validates the effectiveness of proposed method. Moreover, the impact of 3-D rotations, which has rarely been reported in previous works, can be observed in the generated CCF and ACF, which are also consistent with the theoretical and measurement results.  © 2014 IEEE.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85125707762&doi=10.1109%2fJIOT.2022.3155773&partnerID=40&md5=c440e64c7f3da005827ba03ba41b00ef,IEEE Internet of Things Journal,2022
BDTwin: An Integrated Framework for Enhancing Security and Privacy in Cybertwin-Driven Automotive Industrial Internet of Things,"The rapid development of the automotive Industrial Internet of Things requires secure networking infrastructure toward digitalization. Cybertwin (CT) is a next-generation networking architecture that serves as a communication, and digital asset owner, and can make the Vehicle-to-Everything (V2X) network flexible and secure. However, CT itself can publish end users' digital assets to other entities as a service, making data security and privacy major obstacles in the realization of V2X applications. Motivated from the aforementioned discussion, this article presents BDTwin, a blockchain and deep-learning-based integrated framework to enhance security and privacy in CT-driven V2X applications. Specifically, a blockchain scheme is designed to ensure secure communication among vehicles, roadside units, CT-edge server, and cloud server using a smart contract-based enhance-Proof-of-Work (ePoW) and Zero Knowledge Proof (ZKP)-based verification process.

Any-Time Feasible Coordination for Multivehicle Systems,"This article proposes a distributed control methodology for the coordination of multiple connected and automated vehicles (CAVs). Each vehicle computes its local trajectory based on a model predictive control (MPC) law and communicates the result with other relevant vehicles. In an iterative negotiation process, planned trajectories are optimized within a sampling time step. Inspired by the Jacobi over-relaxation (JOR) algorithm, we develop a distributed Jacobi over-relaxation algorithm (DJOR) for vehicle coordination. The modified algorithm exploits the structure of the distributed problem setting in which coupling occurs only in a bilateral way. Besides being able to guarantee any-time feasibility that implies collision-freeness, the algorithm scales well, unlike the standard JOR algorithm. The DJOR algorithm allows for significantly less conservatism in the choice of the update weightings. As a result, much faster convergence rates can be expected. Furthermore, the collision avoidance guarantee is extended for unforeseen scenarios such as emergency braking. Using an exact penalty function formulation ensures that the distributed optimization problem remains feasible even in previously unforeseen cases. Numerical simulations of an intersection crossing scenario illustrate the presented approach and show its benefits in comparison with standard traffic rules and a centralized computation.  © 1993-2012 IEEE.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85119399052&doi=10.1109%2fTCST.2021.3122287&partnerID=40&md5=1f4bf15a6dfc3288e0f68c1e302e95ba,IEEE Transactions on Control Systems Technology,2022
End-to-End Real-Time Obstacle Detection Network for Safe Self-Driving via Multi-Task Learning,"Semantic segmentation and depth estimation lie at the heart of scene understanding and play crucial roles especially for autonomous driving. In particular, it is desirable for an intelligent self-driving agent to discern unexpected obstacles on the road ahead reliably in real-time. While existing semantic segmentation studies for small road hazard detection have incorporated fusion of multiple modalities, they require additional sensor inputs and are often limited by a heavyweight network for real-time processing. In this light, we propose an end-to-end Real-time Obstacle Detection via Simultaneous refinement, coined RODSNet (https://github.com/SAMMiCA/ RODSNet) which jointly learns semantic segmentation and disparity maps from a stereo RGB pair and refines them simultaneously in a single module. RODSNet exploits two efficient single-task network architectures and a simple refinement module in a multi-task learning scheme to recognize unexpected small obstacles on the road. We validate our method by fusing Cityscapes and Lost and Found datasets and show that our method outperforms previous approaches on the obstacle detection task, even recognizing the unannotated obstacles at 14.5 FPS on our fused dataset (2048× 1024 resolution) using RODSNet- 2×. In addition, extensive ablation studies demonstrate that our simultaneous refinement effectively facilitates contextual learning between semantic and depth information.  © 2000-2011 IEEE.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85124843400&doi=10.1109%2fTITS.2022.3149789&partnerID=40&md5=f2a94a669642874550ed584dda3e087e,IEEE Transactions on Intelligent Transportation Systems,2022
SARDO: An Automated Search-and-Rescue Drone-Based Solution for Victims Localization,"Natural disasters affect millions of people every year. Finding missing persons in the shortest possible time is of crucial importance to reduce the death toll. This task is especially challenging when victims are sparsely distributed in large and/or difficult-to-reach areas and cellular networks are down. In this paper we present SARDO, a drone-based search and rescue solution that leverages the high penetration rate of mobile phones in the society to localize missing people. SARDO is an autonomous, all-in-one drone-based mobile network solution that does not require infrastructure support or mobile phones modifications. It builds on novel concepts such as pseudo-trilateration combined with machine-learning techniques to efficiently locate mobile phones in a given area. Our results, with a prototype implementation in a field-[1], show that SARDO rapidly determines the location of mobile phones (∼3 min/UE) in a given area with an accuracy of few tens of meters and at a low battery consumption cost (∼5%). State-of-the-art localization solutions for disaster scenarios rely either on mobile infrastructure support or exploit onboard cameras for human/computer vision, IR, thermal-based localization. To the best of our knowledge, SARDO is the first drone-based cellular search-and-rescue solution able to accurately localize missing victims through mobile phones.  © 2002-2012 IEEE.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85099551486&doi=10.1109%2fTMC.2021.3051273&partnerID=40&md5=a03a86365ceb2af1da5961283e71ebbd,IEEE Transactions on Mobile Computing,2022
Comprehensive Ocean Information-Enabled AUV Path Planning Via Reinforcement Learning,"The path planning of the autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV) has shown great potential in various Internet of Underwater Things (IoUT) applications. Although considerable efforts had been made, prior studies are confronted with some limitations. For one thing, existing work only uses the ocean current simulation model without introducing real ocean information, having not been supported by real data. For another, traditional path planning algorithms have strong environment dependence and lack flexibility: once the environment changes, they need to be remodeled and replanned. To overcome these challenges, this article proposes comprehensive ocean information D3QN (COID), an AUV path planning scheme exploiting comprehensive ocean information and reinforcement learning (RL), which consists of three steps. First, we introduce the comprehensive real ocean data, including weather, temperature, thermohaline, current, etc., and apply them into the regional ocean modeling system to generated reliable ocean current. Next, through well-designed state transition function and reward function, we build a 3-D grid model of ocean environment for RL. Furthermore, based on the framework of the double dueling deep Q network (D3QN), COID integrates local ocean current and position features to provide state input and uses priority sampling to accelerate network convergence. The performance of COID has been evaluated and proved by numerical results, which demonstrate efficient path planning and high flexibility for expansion into different ocean environments.  © 2014 IEEE.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85125755749&doi=10.1109%2fJIOT.2022.3155697&partnerID=40&md5=fb4c7115abaf9d8d3e3f58001e327c02,IEEE Internet of Things Journal,2022
Generative adversarial interactive imitation learning for path following of autonomous underwater vehicle,"Autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV) is playing a more and more important role in marine scientific research and resource exploration due to its flexibility. Recently, deep reinforcement learning (DRL) has been used to improve the autonomy of AUV. However, it is very time-consuming and even unpractical to define efficient reward functions for DRL to learn control policies in various tasks. In this paper, we implemented the generative adversarial imitation learning (GAIL) algorithm learning from demonstrated trajectories and proposed GA2IL learning from demonstrations and additional human rewards for AUV path following. We evaluated GAIL and our GA2IL method in a straight line following task and a sinusoids curve following task on the Gazebo platform extended to simulated underwater environments with AUV simulator of our lab. Both methods were compared to PPO—a classic traditional deep reinforcement learning from a predefined reward function, and a well-tuned PID controller. In addition, to evaluate the generalization of GAIL and our GA2IL method, we tested the trained control policies of the previous two tasks via GAIL and GA2IL in a new complex comb scan following task and a different sinusoids curve following task respectively. Our simulation results show AUV path following with GA2IL and GAIL can obtain a performance at a similar level to PPO and PID controller in both tasks. Moreover, GA2IL can generalize as well as PPO, adapting better to complex and different tasks than traditional PID controller. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85135369245&doi=10.1016%2fj.oceaneng.2022.111971&partnerID=40&md5=0f412bdd3bf1547b59e6402f2edd046e,Ocean Engineering,2022
Cross-Domain Object Detection for Autonomous Driving: A Stepwise Domain Adaptative YOLO Approach,"Supervised object detection models based on deep learning technologies cannot perform well in domain shift scenarios where annotated data for training is always insufficient. To this end, domain adaptation technologies for knowledge transfer have emerged to handle the domain shift problems. A stepwise domain adaptive YOLO (S-DAYOLO) framework is developed which constructs an auxiliary domain to bridge the domain gap and uses a new domain adaptive YOLO (DAYOLO) in cross-domain object detection tasks. Different from the previous solutions, the auxiliary domain is composed of original source images and synthetic images that are translated from source images to the similar ones in the target domain. DAYOLO based on YOLOv5s is designed with a category-consistent regularization module and adaptation modules for image-level and instance-level features to generate domain invariant representations. Our proposed method is trained and evaluated by using five public driving datasets including Cityscapes, Foggy Cityscapes, BDD100K, KITTI, and KAIST. Experiment results demonstrate that object detection performance is significantly improved when using our proposed method in various domain shift scenarios for autonomous driving applications.  © 2016 IEEE.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85127798769&doi=10.1109%2fTIV.2022.3165353&partnerID=40&md5=18f5056b46b7df9142392d744e11ee03,IEEE Transactions on Intelligent Vehicles,2022
SGM3D: Stereo Guided Monocular 3D Object Detection,"Monocular 3D object detection aims to predict the object location, dimension and orientation in 3D space alongside the object category given only a monocular image. It poses a great challenge due to its ill-posed property, which is a critical lack of depth information in the 2D image plane. While existing approaches leverage off-the-shelf depth estimation or rely on LiDAR sensors to mitigate this problem, dependence on the additional depth model or expensive equipment severely limits their scalability to generic 3D perception. In this paper, we propose a stereo-guided monocular 3D object detection framework, dubbed SGM3D, which aligns the monocular feature to the stereo feature and exploits the network's ability of generating the cross-modal feature for accurate 3D object detection. We present a multi-granularity feature alignment (MG-FA) mechanism to exploit the network's ability to generate stereo-mimicking features given only monocular cues. Coarse feature-level, as well as fine anchor-level feature alignment, are both leveraged for monocular feature guidance. In addition, we introduce an IoU matching-based feature alignment (IoU-MA) method for object-level feature alignment between the stereo and monocular predictions to alleviate the mismatches while adopting the MG-FA. Extensive experiments on the KITTI datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our method.

On the Achievability of Submeter-Accurate UAV Navigation with Cellular Signals Exploiting Loose Network Synchronization,"A framework that could achieve submeter-level unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) horizontal navigation in multipath-free environments with cellular carrier phase measurements is developed. This framework exploits the a synchronization between cellular base transceiver station (BTS) clocks. It is shown through extensive experimental data that the beat frequency stability of cellular BTSs approaches that of atomic standards and that the clock deviations can be realized as a stable autoregressive moving average model. This BTS clock model is referred to as loose network synchronization. A rule-of-thumb is established for clustering the clock deviations to minimize the position estimation error, while significantly reducing the computational complexity. The presented models allow the UAV to achieve sustained carrier phase-based meter- to submeter-accurate navigation. To demonstrate the efficacy of the developed framework, this article presents three UAV flight experiments in Southern California, USA, utilizing signals from different cellular providers transmitting at different frequencies. The three experiments took place in open, semiurban environments with nearly multipath-free, line-of-sight (LOS) conditions, in which the UAV traveled 1.72, 3.07, and 0.61 km, achieving a horizontal position root mean squared error of 36.61, 88.58, and 89.33 cm, respectively, with respect to the UAVs on-board navigation system.  © 1965-2011 IEEE.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85127531727&doi=10.1109%2fTAES.2022.3162770&partnerID=40&md5=2d40583065a31de941a1ce49d98356dc,IEEE Transactions on Aerospace and Electronic Systems,2022
Blockchain-Enabled Conditional Decentralized Vehicular Crowdsensing System,"The rapid growth of connected and autonomous vehicles (CAVs) shows an urgent demand for driving and transportation-related data, which gives rise to vehicular crowdsensing systems (VCSs). Nevertheless, the existing centralized VCS framework mainly faces the system reliability problem while the decentralized one cannot satisfy the management flexibility. In addition, when the privacy preservation scheme that prevents information leakage encounters the user selection scheme that desires detailed information of participants, how to balance this seemingly irreconcilable contradiction is inevitable for VCS. To remedy that, we take the first research attempt and explore the balance point between the system management, privacy preservation, and quality of experience (QoE) of participants. By fully exploiting the characters of participating entities, a blockchain-enabled conditional decentralized VCS is proposed in this paper. Firstly, we propose a privacy-preserving scheme where the zk-SNARK proof combines with the mixed-task smart contract to guarantee the interaction process will not reveal any private information of participants. Secondly, we propose an efficient reputation management mechanism that renders certain the participants can get a satisfactory QoE even under the condition that the private information of users is secured. And also, the malicious operations in the system will be effectively supervised. Theoretical analysis and extensive simulations demonstrate the security and efficiency properties of privacy preservation and indicate the effectiveness of reputation management.  © 2000-2011 IEEE.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85128655470&doi=10.1109%2fTITS.2022.3166216&partnerID=40&md5=f9dfe32db3dd8fe5d8744eff24450703,IEEE Transactions on Intelligent Transportation Systems,2022
Learning Interaction-Aware Guidance for Trajectory Optimization in Dense Traffic Scenarios,"Autonomous navigation in dense traffic scenarios remains challenging for autonomous vehicles (AVs) because the intentions of other drivers are not directly observable and AVs have to deal with a wide range of driving behaviors. To maneuver through dense traffic, AVs must be able to reason how their actions affect others (interaction model) and exploit this reasoning to navigate through dense traffic safely. This paper presents a novel framework for interaction-aware motion planning in dense traffic scenarios. We explore the connection between human driving behavior and their velocity changes when interacting. Hence, we propose to learn, via deep Reinforcement Learning (RL), an interaction-aware policy providing global guidance about the cooperativeness of other vehicles to an optimization-based planner ensuring safety and kinematic feasibility through constraint satisfaction. The learned policy can reason and guide the local optimization-based planner with interactive behavior to pro-actively merge in dense traffic while remaining safe in case other vehicles do not yield. We present qualitative and quantitative results in highly interactive simulation environments (highway merging and unprotected left turns) against two baseline approaches, a learning-based and an optimization-based method. The presented results show that our method significantly reduces the number of collisions and increases the success rate with respect to both learning-based and optimization-based baselines.  © 2000-2011 IEEE.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85127832049&doi=10.1109%2fTITS.2022.3160936&partnerID=40&md5=b9cb4b390efa83aaab0a4a4e51dddae0,IEEE Transactions on Intelligent Transportation Systems,2022
Uncovering Interpretable Internal States of Merging Tasks at Highway on-Ramps for Autonomous Driving Decision-Making,"Humans make daily routine decisions based on their internal states in intricate interaction scenarios. This article presents a probabilistically reconstructive learning approach to identify the internal states of multivehicle sequential interactions when merging at highway on-ramps. We treated the merging task's sequential decision as a dynamic, stochastic process and then integrated the internal states into a hidden Markov model (HMM)-Gaussian mixture regression (GMR) model, a probabilistic combination of an extended GMR and HMM. We also developed a variant of the expectation-maximization (EM) algorithm to estimate the model parameters and verified it based on a real-world dataset. Experiment results reveal that three interpretable internal states can semantically describe the interactive merge procedure at highway on-ramps. This finding provides a basis for developing an efficient model-based decision-making algorithm for autonomous vehicles (AVs) in a partially observable environment. Note to Practitioners - Model-based learning approaches have obtained increasing attention in decision-making design due to their stability and interpretability. This article was built upon two facts: 1) intelligent agents can only receive partially observable environmental information directly through their equipped sensors in the real world and 2) humans mainly utilize the internal states and associated dynamics inferred from observations to make proper decisions in complex environments. Similarly, autonomous vehicles (AVs) need to understand, infer, anticipate, and exploit the internal states of dynamic environments. Applying probabilistic decision-making models to AVs requires updating the internal states' beliefs and associated dynamics after getting new observations. The designed and verified emission model in hidden Markov model (HMM)-Gaussian mixture regression (GMR) provides a modifiable functional module for online updates of the associated internal states. Experiment results based on the real-world driving dataset demonstrate that the internal states extracted using HMM-GMR can represent the dynamic decision-making process semantically and make an accurate prediction. © 2004-2012 IEEE.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85140438211&doi=10.1109%2fTASE.2021.3103179&partnerID=40&md5=76ce97af354d0b312cdfe73209dd92f5,IEEE Transactions on Automation Science and Engineering,2022
A New Modeling Approach for Predicting Vehicle-Based Safety Threats,"Existing autonomous driving systems of intelligent vehicles such as advanced driver assistant systems (ADAS) assess and quantify the level of potential safety threats. However, they may not be able to plan the best response to unexpected dangerous situations and do not have the ability to cope with uncertainties since not all vehicles can always keep a safe gap from preceding vehicles and drive at a desired velocity. Previous research has not taken such uncertainties into account, it is, therefore, necessary to develop models which are not restricted by the predefined movement patterns of a vehicle. Existing systems are based on a model that estimates the threat level based only on one factor Time-To-Collision (TTC). This approach is limited since it cannot handle all scenarios and ignores all uncertainties. To overcome these limitations, this paper utilised deep learning to develop a range of models that rely on a group of factors to reliably estimate the threat level and predict conflicts under uncertainty using the concept of looming '. Comparative analyses were undertaken by incorporating new varying input factors to each model (e.g., surrogate safety measures, vehicle kinematics, macroscopic traffic data). Real-world experiments demonstrated that adding new factors increases the reliability and sensitivity of the models. Results also indicated that the models that consider looming provide low false alarm rate extending their applications for a wider spectrum of traffic scenarios. This is paramount for ADAS as uncertainties are inherent in the deployment of connected and autonomous vehicles in a mixed traffic stream. © 2000-2011 IEEE.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85126514041&doi=10.1109%2fTITS.2022.3156763&partnerID=40&md5=0594cd9359b9dd7c44f661752411c00a,IEEE Transactions on Intelligent Transportation Systems,2022
A coalitional security game against data integrity attacks in autonomous vehicle networks,"Autonomous Vehicles (AV) possess an automated driving system that allows the vehicle to respond to external conditions and provide advanced and intelligent transportation services with limited to no human intervention. For AV, the legitimacy and reliability of sensed and transmitted data have direct influence on road network operations. For instance, the integrity of vehicle communications is vulnerable to various threats such as spoofing attacks. Due to the extremely volatile nature of AV, traditional centralized security solutions lack in flexibility and mobility support. Moreover, the very large scale of future AV networks mandates an innovative design of intelligent communications among the vehicles to identify authentic traffic information broadcasted all across the network. In this paper, we design a vehicular collaboration framework that drives the interactions among autonomous vehicles based on trustworthy communications to prevent data integrity attacks. The design involves a distributed, hedonic coalition formation game in which the vehicles evaluate their utilities according to their trust in each other and the data they transmit. The proposed vehicular coalition formation algorithm enables the vehicles to dynamically join and leave the collaborative communities based on trust updates. Vehicles' hybrid trust relationships are derived by integrating the three parameters of the REK model: Reputation, Experience, and Knowledge to optimally exploit the available information in the network and adapt the framework to different road traffic contexts. Furthermore, to protect the formed coalitions against data integrity attacks, a trust-based data aggregation procedure using Dempster-Shafer theory of evidence is adopted to limit the effect of false events on vehicles' decisions. The experimental results show that our collaboration framework is resilient to data corruption and fabrication attacks. © 2022 Elsevier Inc.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85136183038&doi=10.1016%2fj.vehcom.2022.100517&partnerID=40&md5=57a1adad4b09d86b25cb3e19e01e6cc0,Vehicular Communications,2022
Dynamic speed trajectory generation and tracking control for autonomous driving of intelligent high-speed trains combining with deep learning and backstepping control methods,"The development of autonomous transportation systems has received increasing attention over the last decades. Different from existing automatic train control systems, the decision-making capability in the autonomous driving system enables a train to adapt to the complicated and dynamic circumstances. This paper in particular focuses on the decision-making problem for the autonomous driving of intelligent high-speed trains, and proposes a novel decision-making framework by combining the deep learning and backstepping control methods. By exploiting the deep learning methods, a speed trajectory generator is trained with the actual driving data, and dynamically calculates the reference speed trajectory according to the real-time driving condition. Then, a backstepping controller is designed to track the reference speed trajectory such that the separation, cohesion and alignment requirements for the autonomous driving of high-speed trains are achieved.

Trajectory and Transmit Power Optimization for IRS-Assisted UAV Communication Under Malicious Jamming,"In this letter, we investigate an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) communication system, where an intelligent reflecting surface (IRS) is deployed to assist in the transmission from a ground node (GN) to the UAV in the presence of a jammer. We aim to maximize the average rate of the UAV commnunication by jointly optimizing the GN's transmit power, the IRS's passive beamforming and the UAV's trajectory. However, the formulated problem is difficult to solve due to the non-convex objective function and the coupled optimization variables. Thus, to tackle it, we propose an alternating optimization (AO) based algorithm by exploiting the successive convex approximation (SCA) and semidefinite relaxation (SDR) techniques. Simulation results show that the proposed algorithm can significantly improve the average rate compared with the benchmark algorithms. Moreover, it also shows that when the jamming power is large and the number of IRS elements is relatively small, deploying the IRS near the jammer outperforms deploying it near the GN, and vice versa.  © 1967-2012 IEEE.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85133591206&doi=10.1109%2fTVT.2022.3187092&partnerID=40&md5=ce356033aa26bc08aa152edd39c37855,IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology,2022
"Continuous and Precise Positioning in Urban Environments by Tightly Coupled Integration of GNSS, INS and Vision","Accurate, continuous and seamless state estimation is the fundamental module for intelligent navigation applications, such as self-driving cars and autonomous robots. However, it is often difficult for a standalone sensor to fulfill the demanding requirements of precise navigation in complex scenarios. To fill this gap, this letter proposes to exploit the complementariness of the global navigation satellite system (GNSS), inertial measurement unit (IMU) and vision via a tightly coupled integration method, aiming to achieve continuous and accurate navigation in urban environments. Specifically, the raw GNSS carrier phase and pseudorange measurements, IMU data, and visual features are directly fused at the observation level through a centralized Extended Kalman Filter (EKF) to make full use of the multi-sensor information and reject potential outlier measurements. Furthermore, the widely used high-precision GNSS models including precise point positioning (PPP) and real-time kinematic (RTK) are unified in the proposed integrated system to increase usability and flexibility.

Recurrent Models for Lane Change Prediction and Situation Assessment,"Predicting future events accurately is a task of great importance for autonomous vehicles. In this work we focus on lane change events. For this, we propose a novel attention mechanism on top of recurrent neural networks for the prediction task, which improves performance and yields more interpretable models. As critical corner cases are often not considered and reflected in traditional prediction metrics, we additionally introduce a new scenario-based evaluation scheme, which we posit be considered for further maneuver prediction works. Prediction and planning tasks often are correlated, usually sharing input representations and differing in expected outputs and their subsequent consideration. Here, we detail a supporting layer for planning tasks, which analyzes situations w.r.t. their suitability for lane changes and can serve as decision-making support for any planning algorithm. Exploitation of similarities between this task and the aforementioned prediction problem further improves performance of the prediction task, as well as labelling quality of the assessment task.

GNSS-Imaging Data Fusion for Integrity Enhancement in Autonomous Vehicles,"The transport sector is experiencing a fast and revolutionary development, moving toward the deployment of autonomous vehicles. Thus, the accuracy of the position information and the integrity of the navigation system have become key factors. In this article, we address the problem of the enhancement of the integrity of the position provided by a global navigation satellite system receiver by exploiting sensor fusion. To this aim, we estimate the lateral offset and heading of the vehicle with respect to a georeferenced roadway centerline from the images supplied by an on-board camera. Moreover, we perform integrity monitoring based on the implementation of the solution separation in the parity space. The numerical results indicate that the use of sensor fusion and digital map allows us to attain a longitudinal protection level reduction with respect to the case in which sensor fusion is not exploited. More specifically, a decrease of about 70% is achieved when a single constellation is used, while reduction is less relevant, about 15%, when two constellations are employed.  © 1965-2011 IEEE.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85128264494&doi=10.1109%2fTAES.2022.3165771&partnerID=40&md5=6e47105e7412ff22d26219ae27afedf8,IEEE Transactions on Aerospace and Electronic Systems,2022
Enhancing Feedback Steering Controllers for Autonomous Vehicles with Deep Monte Carlo Tree Search,"Steering control is a vital function for autonomous vehicles, whose performance largely determines the driving safety. The widely used feedback steering controllers degrade significantly when vehicles drive at high speeds. This is mainly because these controllers can not effectively exploit nonlinear vehicle dynamics and future road information. Hence, the steering actions generated by these controllers can not achieve accurate and stable path tracking performance. To overcome this limitation, we propose a deep learning based Monte Carlo Tree Search (DeepMCTS) method to enhance the feedback controllers. Due to the accuracy of the learning-based model in characterizing nonlinear vehicle dynamics and the lookahead search ability of MCTS, the control performance of the feedback controllers can be enhanced significantly. Different from MPC methods, which leverage vehicle dynamics and future road information via online optimization, our method relies on the efficient tree search process. Hence, our method can avoid heavy computational burden.

Denial of service attacks are executed that leverage DSRC RSU timing and packet size side-channels to selectively disable the stoplight. Simulations are implemented to determine our ability to stealthily drop packets so as to force two vehicles to collide. Hidden Markov models (HMM) and Support Vector Machines (SVM) are constructed from sniffed side-channel information. We use inter-packet delay time and packet size side-channel information to design our attackes. In operational networks, packets should be encrypted in order to hide the contents of the packet payloads, but packet sizes and timing are not affected by encryption. HMMs were inferred using only side-channel information. The inferred HMMs track the protocol status over time. The SVM classifier was inferred using both side-channel data and packet payloads. At run-time, though, the SVM only had access to side-channel information. Simulation experiments were implemented to test HMM and SVM ability to identify packets used to signal vehicles to stop and yield right-of-way. Timing HMM side-channel attack caused collision with 2.5% false positive rate (FPR), while the packet size one resulted 9.5% FPR.  © 2000-2011 IEEE.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85128634613&doi=10.1109%2fTITS.2022.3164779&partnerID=40&md5=d0d4005133a1a2a030dc5fc00f32d7d1,IEEE Transactions on Intelligent Transportation Systems,2022
SLAP-IoD: Secure and Lightweight Authentication Protocol Using Physical Unclonable Functions for Internet of Drones in Smart City Environments,"With the emergence of the concept of smart city and the increasing demands for a range of drones, Internet of Drones (IoD) has achieved a variety of attention by providing multiple benefits in academia and industry. IoD offers numerous services, such as traffic monitoring, environmental monitoring, and disaster management by combining infrastructure, Internet of Things (IoT), and Flying Ad-Hoc Networks (FANET) in smart city environments. However, communication among drones is vulnerable to potential security threats because the sensitive messages in various applications are exchanged via an insecure channel in IoD-based smart city environments. Since IoDs can be operated in unattended environment with minimum human interventions, smart devices (e.g., drones and sensors) deployed in IoD architectures are vulnerable to physical capture attacks. In addition, drones are resource-constrained in terms of computation and communication overheads, and it is not much viable to apply public key cryptography (PKC) that requires high computation and communication overheads. Thus, we design a secure and lightweight authentication protocol using a physical unclonable function (PUF) for IoD to guarantee reliable and useful services in smart city environments, called SLAP-IoD. We prove the security of the SLAP-IoD using informal and formal security analyses using the broadly recognized Real-Or-Random (ROR) random oracle model, and also through the formal security verification using the widely-accepted Automated Validation of Internet Security-sensitive Protocols and Applications (AVISPA) security verification. Furthermore, we compare the performance of the SLAP-IoD with related schemes. Consequently, we show that SLAP-IoD offers better security and efficiency than other related schemes and is suitable for IoD-based smart city environments.  © 1967-2012 IEEE.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85134246689&doi=10.1109%2fTVT.2022.3188769&partnerID=40&md5=8192ae02087a8af193e06287a3b61745,IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology,2022
String Stable and Collision-Safe Model Predictive Platoon Control,"Automated vehicle platooning bears high potential to increase traffic efficiency, improve road safety, and reduce fuel consumption. To realize platoons with small inter-vehicle distances, collision safety is the most crucial concern and needs to be considered carefully. Moreover, it is desired to attenuate disturbances along the platoon which is known as string stability. While model predictive control concepts achieve efficient, situation-aware, and safe platooning, establishing string stability properties is difficult. In this work string stability is characterized for a generic feedback setting. A workflow to design an extended time gap spacing policy is proposed for a safety-extended distributed model predictive platooning controller. It provides safe, tightly-packed platoon operation with robust string stability near steady-state even without vehicle-to-vehicle-V2V-communication. Platoon performance is further improved by exploiting V2V-communication. Finally, the resulting closed-loop platoon dynamics are validated in a high-fidelity co-simulation study.  © 2000-2011 IEEE.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85127515276&doi=10.1109%2fTITS.2022.3160236&partnerID=40&md5=4fbd41c649d2ec863f299ee97e656656,IEEE Transactions on Intelligent Transportation Systems,2022
Kinematic Orienteering Problem With Time-Optimal Trajectories for Multirotor UAVs,"In many unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) applications for surveillance and data collection, it is not possible to reach all requested locations due to the given maximum flight time. Hence, the requested locations must be prioritized and the problem of selecting the most important locations is modeled as an Orienteering Problem (OP). To fully exploit the kinematic properties of the UAV in such scenarios, we combine the OP with the generation of time-optimal trajectories with bounds on velocity and acceleration. We define the resulting problem as the Kinematic Orienteering Problem (KOP) and propose an exact mixed-integer formulation together with a Large Neighborhood Search (LNS) as a heuristic solution method. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach based on orienteering instances from the literature and benchmark against optimal solutions of the Dubins Orienteering Problem (DOP) as the state-of-the-art. Additionally, we show by simulation that the resulting solutions can be tracked precisely by a modern MPC-based flight controller. Since we demonstrate that the state-of-the-art in generating time-optimal trajectories in multiple dimensions is not generally correct, we further present an improved analytical method for time-optimal trajectory generation.  © 2016 IEEE.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85135735790&doi=10.1109%2fLRA.2022.3194688&partnerID=40&md5=49ae16354e719ebbdbf9788e0d093563,IEEE Robotics and Automation Letters,2022
Investigation into the laminar separation control of airfoils at low Reynolds numbers by dimple vortex generators,"Unmanned Air Vehicles (UAV) usually encounter flows at low Reynolds numbers, especially for the small and high-altitude ones. For an airfoil in a low-Reynolds-number flow, laminar separation can significantly downgrade the lift and increase the drag, causing a large reduction in the lift-drag ratio. The present study investigates a passive laminar separation control approach by the dimple vortex generator, while considering the effect of Reynolds numbers on aerodynamic performances. By using the strategically designed dimples, this passive approach is expected to improve airfoil performances at low Reynolds numbers and cause small penalties at high Reynolds numbers. For the applications in UAV, the natural-laminar-flow airfoil NLF(1)-0416 is used as the baseline case, and a moderate angle of attack of 5° is studied. For both the baseline and the dimpled airfoils, large eddy simulations are conducted at the Reynolds numbers of 68,500, 137,000, and 205,400. The lift and drag forces of the airfoils are measured during the wind tunnel experiments within the Reynolds number range of 39,000–230,000. The numerical results provide the in-depth investigation of the flow transition processes and the separation-reattachment flows at different Reynolds numbers, demonstrating their coupling mechanisms and the consequences for the aerodynamic performances. The utilization of dimple vortex generators can significantly reduce the separation region and tremendously improve the low-Reynolds-number performances of the airfoil. For the dimpled airfoil, the experimental results show that the total drag can be reduced by up to 43%, and the lift-drag ratio can be greatly improved by up to 337%, which are the encouraging results achieved by the passive control approach using dimples. For the numerical results, the vortex visualization shows that the Kelvin–Helmholtz instability over the dimples results in the three-dimensional vortex shedding and the transition to turbulence. The streamwise counter-rotating vortex structures induced by the dimples also contribute to the earlier reattachment of the near-wall flow. © 2022 Elsevier Masson SAS",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85137081724&doi=10.1016%2fj.ast.2022.107841&partnerID=40&md5=816c9809be06b3f2301225a2b66496a5,Aerospace Science and Technology,2022
Unmanned Ground Vehicle Platooning Under Cyber Attacks: A Human-Robot Interaction Framework,"In this paper, we propose a human-robot interaction (HRI) framework to reduce the vulnerability of an unmanned ground vehicle (UGV) platoon under cyber attacks. An observer-based autonomous resilient control strategy is first designed to mitigate the effects of vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) cyber attacks. Rigorous proof of the safety conditions of the platoon under V2V cyber attacks is derived. Next, to facilitate human supervision in emergencies and uncertainties, a decision-making aid system is developed, which consists of an anomaly reporting system (ARS), a trust-based information management system (TIMS), and a graphical user interface (GUI). ARS is designed to detect the abnormality of the neighbor UGVs based on the model-based residual generation and analysis. TIMS is developed to rule out information with low trustworthiness, which is fulfilled by a Bayesian-based information pre-processor followed by an enhanced median filter with trustworthiness regulation. It is rigorously proved that TIMS can recover the tempered information under the mild cyber attack scenario autonomously. To deal with unexpected severe vehicle-to-cloud (V2C) cyber attacks, human observations can also be leveraged to bolster the resilience of the TIMS. Representative simulation and humans-in-the-loop experiment (fulfilled by the designed GUI) demonstrate that the proposed framework can effectively guide human operators when working with UGV platoons under cyber attacks. On average, compared to a multi-screen surveillance benchmark approach, the proposed framework can achieve 78.4% decrements of platoon vulnerability and 39.0% decrements in human workload. © 2000-2011 IEEE.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85125320303&doi=10.1109%2fTITS.2022.3150745&partnerID=40&md5=4e92452ff800284ff503e4528c2ee7c6,IEEE Transactions on Intelligent Transportation Systems,2022
Stepwise Domain Adaptation (SDA) for Object Detection in Autonomous Vehicles Using an Adaptive CenterNet,"In recent years, deep learning technologies for object detection have made great progress and have powered the emergence of state-of-the-art models to address object detection problems. Since the domain shift can make detectors unstable or even crash, the detection of cross-domain becomes very important for the design of object detectors. However, traditional deep learning technologies for object detection always rely on a large amount of reliable ground-truth labelling that is laborious, costly, and time-consuming. Although an advanced approach CycleGAN has been proposed for cross-domain object detection tasks, the ability of CycleGAN to reduce the divergence across domains at the feature level is limited. In this paper, a stepwise domain adaptation (SDA) detection method is proposed to further improve the performance of CycleGAN by minimizing the divergence in cross-domain object detection tasks. Specifically, the domain shift is addressed in two steps. In the first step, to bridge the domain gap, an unpaired image-to-image translator is trained to construct a fake target domain by translating the source images to the similar ones in the target domain. In the second step, to further minimize divergence across domains, an adaptive CenterNet is designed to align distributions at the feature level in an adversarial learning manner. Our proposed method is evaluated in domain shift scenarios based on the driving datasets including Cityscapes, Foggy Cityscapes, SIM10k, and BDD100K. The results show that our method is superior to the state-of-the-art methods and is effective for object detection in domain shift scenarios.  © 2000-2011 IEEE.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85128332244&doi=10.1109%2fTITS.2022.3164407&partnerID=40&md5=943852fcadbec543f0d77506dd779387,IEEE Transactions on Intelligent Transportation Systems,2022
A Pairing-Free Heterogeneous Signcryption Scheme for Unmanned Aerial Vehicles,"During the past few years, as Internet of Things develops rapidly, the applications of unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) technology have been increasingly widely used. Meanwhile, the efficiency and security issues of UAV communication have brought about widespread attention of many researchers in different fields. In an open wireless network, the attacks on UAV communication mainly include eavesdropping, tampering, interrupting, forgery, etc. Signcryption is an appropriate method to address these security problems. However, the existing signcryption schemes are not suitable for UAVs with limited resources and ground station (GS) that needs to process a large number of messages from UAVs. Moreover, in a certain area, UAVs and a GS may belong to different cryptosystems. Therefore, in this article, we came up with a heterogeneous signcryption scheme for UAVs to communicate to a GS (HSC-U2G) without bilinear pairing operation, where UAVs belong to identity-based cryptography (IBC) while the GS belongs to public-key infrastructure (PKI). Moreover, our scheme provides identity privacy for UAVs and supports batch verification for the GS. Using the random oracle model, we demonstrate HSC-U2G can achieve insider security for confidentiality as well as unforgeability. After that, HSC-U2G is compared with several important related works and we provide all experimental results to show the efficiency. © 2014 IEEE.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85129630299&doi=10.1109%2fJIOT.2022.3167102&partnerID=40&md5=f72334f7ec83e2fde43dcc3b0ecf0677,IEEE Internet of Things Journal,2022
An approximate dynamic programming approach for solving an air combat maneuvering problem,"Within visual range air combat involves execution of highly complex and dynamic activities, requiring rapid, sequential decision-making to achieve success. Fighter pilots spend years perfecting tactics and maneuvers for these types of combat engagements, yet the ongoing emergence of unmanned, autonomous vehicle technologies elicits a natural question — can an autonomous unmanned combat aerial vehicle (AUCAV) be imbued with the necessary artificial intelligence to perform challenging air combat maneuvering tasks independently? We formulate and solve the air combat maneuvering problem (ACMP) to examine this important question, developing a Markov decision process (MDP) model to control a defending AUCAV seeking to destroy an attacking adversarial vehicle. The MDP model includes a 5-degree-of-freedom, point-mass aircraft state transition model to accurately represent both kinematics and energy while maneuvering. An approximate dynamic programming (ADP) approach is proposed wherein we develop and test an approximate policy iteration algorithm that implements value function approximation via neural network regression to attain high-quality maneuver policies for the AUCAV. A representative intercept scenario is specified for testing purposes wherein the AUCAV must engage and destroy an adversary aircraft attempting to penetrate the defended airspace. Several designed experiments are conducted to determine how aircraft velocity and adversary maneuvering tactics impact the efficacy of the proposed ADP solution approach and to enable efficient algorithm parameter tuning. ADP-generated policies are compared to two benchmark maneuver policies constructed from two reward shaping functions found in the ACMP literature, attaining improved mean probabilities of kill for 24 of 36 air combat situations considered. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85130324624&doi=10.1016%2fj.eswa.2022.117448&partnerID=40&md5=d05a96ee4e5c6624bfe213b3a5bcfe53,Expert Systems with Applications,2022
Passive UAV Tracking in Wireless Networks,"Techniques for high accuracy tracking of the 3-D velocity, position, and cellular carrier frequency bias of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) that communicate using a cellular network are presented. The tracking algorithm does only rely on asynchronous measurements of Doppler shift in a minimum of four base station sites. This number can be reduced to three, by combination with a round-Trip time measurement from one site. The tracking is therefore independent of any capability of the UAV transceiver, like the global positioning system that may be disabled in the UAV by the pilot. Another significant advantage is that high precision time synchronization between base stations is not needed. The algorithm exploits interacting multiple model filtering, with the nonlinear measurement equations handled by extended Kalman filters. The low computational complexity, low sampling rate, and the uplink Doppler shift measurement resources enable joint tracking of several UAVs per cell. This makes the tracking technique relevant for supervision of UAV traffic using cellular connectivity, for example for border surveillance and surveillance of sensitive areas like airports where illegal flying may be extremely dangerous and costly. Theoretically, an observability analysis treats measurement configurations based on different combinations of Doppler shift and round-Trip time. Simulations are used to illustrate the performance and to assess the initialization properties.  © 1965-2011 IEEE.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85126290571&doi=10.1109%2fTAES.2022.3158640&partnerID=40&md5=082508729335e7675c5ee83e298bd8b6,IEEE Transactions on Aerospace and Electronic Systems,2022
A Novel Direct Trajectory Planning Approach Based on Generative Adversarial Networks and Rapidly-Exploring Random Tree,"Trajectory planning is essential for self-driving vehicles and has stringent requirements for accuracy and efficiency. The existing trajectory planning methods have limitations in the feasibility of planned trajectories and computational efficiency. This paper proposes a life-long learning framework to achieve effective and high-accuracy direct trajectory planning (DTP) tasks. Based on generative adversarial networks (GANs), this study develops a lightweight GDTP model to map the initial/final states and the control action sequence. Additionally, by embedding the GDTP into the rapidly-exploring random tree (RRT), a GDTP-RRT algorithm is further designed for long-distance and multi-stage planning tasks. Taking the tractor-trailer as an application case, we test the proposed method in multiple scenarios with varying characteristics. The experimental results show that the method can plan highly feasible trajectories in a short time, compared with the most applied algorithm-the cubic curve RRT∗ (CCRRT∗). It is found that the tracking errors of our method are 29.1% and 44.1% lower than the CCRRT∗ in terms of position and heading angle.

Pre-Predictive Congestion-Based Data Allocation for Sixth Generation Cooperative Intelligent Transportation Systems,"Cooperative intelligent and autonomous transportation systems rely on intelligent sensing, computing, and actuating technologies for unmanned freight and public movements. The information gained from neighbors and communication infrastructures provides efficient actuation for safe and sustained transportation. This article resolves traffic data management congestion using sixth-generation (6G) communication and computing techniques. Terahertz and machine-type communications are exploited for swift information exchange, bypassing the congestion effects. Congestion occurs when demand for road space exceeds supply. This proposal incorporates prediction-based learning to compute the feasibility of handling traffic information and cooperative intelligent transportation. This model is named Congestion-aware Pre-predictive Data Allocation (CPPDA). The traffic flows causing congestion in the data exchange process are predicted for re-allocation and independent channel utilization. In this learning, the pre-predicted instances are updated with the actual identified utilization-to-congestion rate. Therefore, the congestion-causing channels for sensing are identified with ease, reducing the outage. The outage is examined for a basic inter-vehicle data link. Through the optimal allocation of channels for actuation, cloud-aided resources are utilized to a maximum level, leveraging infrastructure support. In addition to an outage of 10.83%, the response time of 14.75%, congestion factor of 8.2%, computational overhead of 6.4%, and information gain factors of 6.86% are analyzed through a comparative study.  © 2000-2011 IEEE.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85139405877&doi=10.1109%2fTITS.2022.3198806&partnerID=40&md5=deff7ebdc0d1919bf46d2f2d36f6497a,IEEE Transactions on Intelligent Transportation Systems,2022
Caching and UAV Friendly Jamming for Secure Communications With Active Eavesdropping Attacks,"In this paper, we discuss the security and reliability performance of a communication system, where the base station (BS) transmits signals to multiple users and an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) jammer sends friendly jamming signals to protect against a full-duplex active eavesdropper with the aid of caching. We derive the closed-form expressions of outage probability (OP) and intercept probability (IP) for the legitimate users and active eavesdropper, respectively. Aimed at minimizing the sum of the IP and the maximum OP among all users, we jointly optimize the BS transmit power, UAV jammer location and jamming power. An efficient algorithm based on alternating optimization (AO) and successive convex approximation (SCA) methods is designed to solve the optimization problem. Numerical results show that compared to other benchmark strategies, the proposed solution improves the reliability and security performance with the aid of caching and UAV friendly jamming.  © 1967-2012 IEEE.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85133583862&doi=10.1109%2fTVT.2022.3186730&partnerID=40&md5=8e517876db7cefa0d1a378c1b70afb59,IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology,2022
Analysis of ID Sequences Similarity Using DTW in Intrusion Detection for CAN Bus,"Connected vehicles have recently attracted considerable attention for revolutionizing the transportation industry. Although connectivity brings about a vast number of benefits, it can give rise to a wider attack surface as more physical access interfaces have been introduced. In particular, anomalous behaviour of the Electronic Control Units (ECUs) caused by malicious attacks can result in serious consequences and possibly lead to fatal accidents. Hence, it is important to develop methodologies that can sniff vehicular data and detect it for further attack analysis. In this article, we develop a novel similarity-based intrusion detection methodology named SIDuDTW, which identifies malicious messages inside vehicle network, e.g., Controller Area Network (CAN), by using Dynamic Time Warping (DTW) distance between CAN ID sequences. Subsequently, the theoretical analysis for the recurring sequence pattern, wave splitting strategies, similarity metric, and optimal parameters providing strong robustness against several kinds of attacks in SIDuDTW are detailed. A series of experiments demonstrate that the developed methodology can detect attacks with high accuracy. In addition, this proposed methodology significantly outperforms the intrusion detection capabilities of existing approaches in terms of basic injection, replay and suppression attacks. It is envisioned that this work will contribute to the development of safer autonomous vehicle conceptualized as a key unit within broader smart city.  © 1967-2012 IEEE.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85133590312&doi=10.1109%2fTVT.2022.3185111&partnerID=40&md5=088022df1e3878713ec7b9454b5f8ebc,IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology,2022
Prioritized Delay Optimization for NOMA-Based Multi-UAV Emergency Networks,"In emergency networks, it is significant to jointly consider users' priorities and communication delays for post-disaster users. To this end, we propose an essential metric by integrating these two factors, namely prioritized delay. Moreover, we formulate a min-max prioritized delay problem for non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA)-based multi-unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) emergency networks, where the powers of all users are concurrently optimized to balance prioritized delay among users while suppressing multi-user interference introduced by NOMA and multiple UAVs. The problem is found to be non-convex, and we propose the substitution-decomposition-scaling-block successive upper bound minimization (SDS-BSUM) algorithm to address this issue. Specifically, the originally-formulated problem is first transformed into a standard form through variable substitution, followed by problem decomposition into single-UAV subproblems through exploiting its separable structure, and the scaling of non-convex constraints into tight convex ones. Finally, the converted problem is fitted into BSUM for solving. Simulation results reveal that compared with the existing schemes, the proposed SDS-BSUM not only reduces the prioritized delay by up to 70%, but also achieves an excellent delay fairness commensurate with users' priorities.  © 1967-2012 IEEE.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85133603913&doi=10.1109%2fTVT.2022.3184955&partnerID=40&md5=a86a1ca2b2381d471a71e9fe31367a14,IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology,2022
A Secure and Lightweight Drones-Access Protocol for Smart City Surveillance,"The rising popularity of ICT and the Internet has enabled Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) to offer advantageous assistance to Vehicular Ad-hoc Network (VANET), realizing a relay node's role among the disconnected segments in the road. In this scenario, the communication is done between Vehicles to UAVs (V2U), subsequently transforming into a UAV-assisted VANET. UAV-assisted VANET allows users to access real-time data, especially the monitoring data in smart cities using current mobile networks. Nevertheless, due to the open nature of communication infrastructure, the high mobility of vehicles along with the security and privacy constraints are the significant concerns of UAV-assisted VANET. In these scenarios, Deep Learning Algorithms (DLA) could play an effective role in the security, privacy, and routing issues of UAV-assisted VANET. Keeping this in mind, we have devised a DLA-based key-exchange protocol for UAV-assisted VANET. The proposed protocol extends the scalability and uses secure bitwise XOR operations, one-way hash functions, including user's biometric verification when users and drones are mutually authenticated. The proposed protocol can resist many well-known security attacks and provides formal and informal security under the Random Oracle Model (ROM).

Context-Aware Multiagent Broad Reinforcement Learning for Mixed Pedestrian-Vehicle Adaptive Traffic Light Control,"Efficient traffic light control is a critical part of realizing smart transportation. In particular, deep reinforcement learning (DRL) algorithms that use deep neural networks (DNNs) have superior autonomous decision-making ability. Most existing work has applied DRL to control traffic lights intelligently. In this article, we propose a novel context-aware multiagent broad reinforcement learning (CAMABRL) approach based on broad reinforcement learning (BRL) for mixed pedestrian-vehicle adaptive traffic light control (ATLC). CAMABRL exploits the broad learning system (BLS) established in a flat network structure to make decisions instead of a deep network structure. Unlike previous works that consider the attributes of vehicles, CAMABRL also takes the states of pedestrians waiting at the intersection into consideration. Combining with the context-aware mechanism that utilizes the states of adjacent agents and potential state information captured by the long short-term memory (LSTM) network, agents can make farsighted decisions to alleviate traffic congestion. The experimental results show that CAMABRL is superior to several state-of-the-art multiagent reinforcement learning (MARL) methods.  © 2014 IEEE.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85128326269&doi=10.1109%2fJIOT.2022.3167029&partnerID=40&md5=69ce0818fa21ea7f25b4e57de0b39603,IEEE Internet of Things Journal,2022
Computation Capacity Enhancement by Joint UAV and RIS Design in IoT,"Mobile-edge computing (MEC) networks are facing limited coverage and harsh wireless transmission environments that severely hinder the computation capacity of the Internet-of-Things (IoT) devices. To overcome these issues, this article proposes a novel MEC framework empowered by an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) relay and a reconfigurable intelligence surface (RIS). To fully exploit the potentials in terms of computation enhancement brought by the joint UAV and RIS design, we formulate a max-min computation capacity problem via determining the uplink signal detection, active beamforming of UAV, passive beamforming of RIS, time slot partition, computation bits of UAV, and UAV's trajectory. We develop a concave-convex procedure (CCCP)-based algorithm in an alternating optimization manner over three subproblems to solve the formulated problem. It finds that the CCCP-based algorithm is conducive to decouple the intractable expressions by converting them into new but tractable second-order cone (SOC) constrains. To evaluate the performance of the proposed CCCP-based algorithm, we later design a direct algorithm by exploiting the implicit convexity of the problem. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed CCCP-based algorithm derives a comparable performance as the direct algorithm, and achieves about 2.57-Mb max-min computation capacity higher compared with the straight flight case, and 8.08-Mb max-min computation capacity higher compared with the case without RIS, which validate the superiority of the joint UAV and RIS design for computation enhancement. © 2014 IEEE.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85131770197&doi=10.1109%2fJIOT.2022.3178983&partnerID=40&md5=5096ba98881918d45598f9a9e8c6c8ef,IEEE Internet of Things Journal,2022

A Sequential Algorithm for Jerk Limited Speed Planning,"In this article, we discuss a sequential algorithm for the computation of a minimum-time speed profile over a given path, under velocity, acceleration, and jerk constraints. Such a problem arises in industrial contexts, such as automated warehouses, where LGVs need to perform assigned tasks as fast as possible in order to increase productivity. It can be reformulated as an optimization problem with a convex objective function, linear velocity and acceleration constraints, and nonconvex jerk constraints, which, thus, represent the main source of the difficulty. While existing nonlinear programming (NLP) solvers can be employed for the solution of this problem, it turns out that the performance and robustness of such solvers can be enhanced by the sequential line-search algorithm proposed in this article. At each iteration, a feasible direction, with respect to the current feasible solution, is computed, and a step along such direction is taken in order to compute the next iterate. The computation of the feasible direction is based on the solution of a linearized version of the problem, and the solution of the linearized problem, through an approach that strongly exploits its special structure, represents the main contribution of this work. The efficiency of the proposed approach with respect to existing NLP solvers is proven through different computational experiments. Note to Practitioners-This article was motivated by the needs of LGV manufacturers. In particular, it presents an algorithm for computing the minimum-time speed law for an LGV along a preassigned path, respecting assigned velocity, acceleration, and jerk constraints. The solution algorithm should be: 1) fast, since speed planning is made continuously throughout the workday, not only when an LGV receives a new task but also during the execution of the task itself, since conditions may change, e.g., if the LGV has to be halted for security reasons and 2) reliable, i.e., it should return solutions of high quality, because a better speed profile allows to save time and even small percentage improvements, say a 5% improvement, has a considerable impact on the productivity of the warehouse, and, thus, determines a significant economic gain. The algorithm that we propose meets these two requirements, and we believe that it can be a useful tool for LGV manufacturers and users. It is obvious that the proposed method also applies to the speed planning problem for vehicles other than LGVs, e.g., road vehicles.  © 2004-2012 IEEE.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85117258568&doi=10.1109%2fTASE.2021.3111758&partnerID=40&md5=c5ec0893d75cbb96e0fc6ac1a11185ac,IEEE Transactions on Automation Science and Engineering,2022
Autonomous underwater vehicle formation control and obstacle avoidance using multi-agent generative adversarial imitation learning,"Autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV) is widely used in complex underwater missions such as bottom survey and data collection. Multiple AUVs can cooperatively complete tasks that single AUV cannot accomplish. Recently, multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) has been introduced to improve multi-AUV control in uncertain marine environments. However, it is very difficult and even unpractical to design effective and efficient reward functions for various tasks. In this paper, we implemented multi-agent generative adversarial imitation learning (MAGAIL) from expert demonstrated trajectories for formation control and obstacle avoidance of multi-AUV. In addition, decentralized training with decentralized execution framework was adopted to alleviate the communication problem in underwater environments. Moreover, to facilitate the discriminator to accurately judge the quality of AUV's trajectory in the two tasks and increase the convergence speed, we improved upon MAGAIL by dividing the state–action pairs of expert trajectory for each AUV into two groups and updating discriminator by randomly selecting equal number of state–action pairs from both groups. Our experimental results on a simulated AUV system modeling Sailfish 210 of our lab in the Gazebo simulation environment show that MAGAIL allows control policies of multi-AUV to obtain a better performance than traditional multi-agent deep reinforcement learning from fine-tuned reward function — IPPO. Moreover, control policies trained via MAGAIL in simple tasks can generalize better to complex tasks than those trained via IPPO. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85136605460&doi=10.1016%2fj.oceaneng.2022.112182&partnerID=40&md5=5d574c02e57cb838b45bbae8cbe8d098,Ocean Engineering,2022
Bearing-based prescribed-time formation control of underactuated autonomous surface vehicles with the interception of attackers,"This paper studies the bearing-based prescribed-time formation keeping control problem of collaborative underactuated autonomous surface vehicles (ASVs) systems subject to malicious attacks, model uncertainties and external disturbances. For the leader-follower formation control structure, the leaders usually serve as pacemakers and play dominating role in generating the reference trajectory. On this account, it is imperative to ensure the safety of the leaders when attacks occur. To prevent the breakdown of the formation system from attacks, our control strategy mainly focuses on the following two points: 1) assigning defenders from the collaborative underactuated ASVs system to intercept the oncoming attackers, and 2) ensuring the formation keeping maneuvers of the remaining ASVs to be isolated from the influence arising from the interception mission. With these in mind, a defender allocation algorithm is developed to switch the formation keeping control mode to the interception control mode smoothly when the attackers get close to the leaders. Meanwhile, a bearing-based formation interception control strategy is developed, in which a formation keeping control scheme and an interception control scheme are designed under a unified framework by sharing the same control form and different tracking objectives. Besides, for the sake of a faster convergence rate of the resulting closed-loop system, a dynamic control gain is introduced into the formation keeping control scheme to endow the formation keeping system with a prescribed-time convergence capability. Numerical simulations are conducted to illustrate the efficacy of our approach. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85135953001&doi=10.1016%2fj.oceaneng.2022.112187&partnerID=40&md5=1eddd32d44a3f9ad8b03c1db65957f76,Ocean Engineering,2022
A Secure Sensor Fusion Framework for Connected and Automated Vehicles Under Sensor Attacks,"As typical applications of cyber-physical systems (CPSs), connected and automated vehicles (CAVs) are able to measure the surroundings and share local information with the other vehicles by using multimodal sensors and wireless networks. CAVs are expected to increase safety, efficiency, and capacity of our transportation systems. However, the increasing usage of sensors has also increased the vulnerability of CAVs to sensor faults and adversarial attacks. Anomalous sensor values resulting from malicious cyberattacks or faulty sensors may cause severe consequences or even fatalities. In this article, we increase the resilience of CAVs to faults and attacks by using multiple sensors for measuring the same physical variable to create redundancy. We exploit this redundancy and propose a sensor fusion algorithm for providing a robust estimate of the correct sensor information with bounded errors independent of the attack signals, and for attack detection and isolation. The proposed sensor fusion framework is applicable to a large class of security-critical CPSs. To minimize the performance degradation resulting from the usage of the estimation for control, we provide an H∞ controller for cooperative adaptive cruise control-equipped CAVs. The designed controller is capable of stabilizing the closed-loop dynamics of each vehicle in the platoon while reducing the joint effect of estimation errors and communication channel noise on the tracking performance and string behavior of the vehicle platoon. Numerical examples are presented to illustrate the effectiveness of our methods.  © 2014 IEEE.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85112614658&doi=10.1109%2fJIOT.2021.3101502&partnerID=40&md5=6e9ecdb947f5102d5b88c9860b28a7fa,IEEE Internet of Things Journal,2022
Adversarial Attacks and Defenses for Deep-Learning-Based Unmanned Aerial Vehicles,"The introduction of deep learning (DL) technology can improve the performance of cyber-physical systems (CPSs) in many ways. However, this also brings new security issues. To tackle these challenges, this article explores the vulnerabilities of DL-based unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), which are typical CPSs. Although many research works have been reported previously on adversarial attacks of DL models, only few of them are concerned about safety-critical CPSs, especially regression models in such systems. In this article, we analyze the problem of adversarial attacks against DL-based UAVs and propose two adversarial attack methods against regression models in UAVs. The experiments demonstrate that the proposed nontargeted and targeted attack methods both can craft imperceptible adversarial images and pose a considerable threat to the navigation and control of UAVs. To address this problem, adversarial training and defensive distillation methods are further investigated and evaluated, increasing the robustness of DL models in UAVs. To our knowledge, this is the first study on adversarial attacks and defenses against DL-based UAVs, which calls for more attention to the security and safety of such safety-critical applications.  © 2014 IEEE.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85114740908&doi=10.1109%2fJIOT.2021.3111024&partnerID=40&md5=df148b1dc9a1266f83fcaf6c258f3d08,IEEE Internet of Things Journal,2022
Privacy-Enabling Framework for Cloud-Assisted Digital Healthcare Industry,"As the technology era progresses, many opportunities are brought to the healthcare industry. With the support of technology and Internet of Things platforms, e-healthcare is now more common than ever. However, the sensitive nature of healthcare records makes them vulnerable to many attacks. Therefore, a privacy-enabled framework for cloud-based e-healthcare systems is proposed to achieve privacy-preserved and secured communication in e-healthcare. The analysis of the proposed protocol is presented in this article to demonstrate that it is secure against all well-known security attacks and provides patient anonymity, doctor anonymity, and patient and doctor unlinkability while ensuring data confidentiality. Additionally, the security simulations are performed using the Automated Validation of Internet Security Protocols and Applications tool. We also performed the proposed framework's performance analysis and compared it with existing frameworks.

Secure consensus switching control for multiagent system under abnormal deception attacks and its application to unmanned surface vehicle clusters,"In this paper, we focus on the secure consensus of multiagent system (MAS) under abnormal deception attacks based on a switching control strategy. Due to the openness and shareability of communication network, abnormal deception attacks can be successfully launched into the MAS in a certain probability, which will cause the control signals transmitted through network to be completely modified. An aperiodic switching controller is proposed to improve the system's ability to tolerate attacks, which also greatly reduces the number of actuator actions and reserves time for next execution. In order to reduce the conservatism of results, a novel Lyapunov–Krasovskii functional is constructed by introducing some extra looped functional terms and states variable to increase the storage of sampling information. A sufficient condition for the secure consensus of MAS is established according to the designed control protocol. Finally, a consensus control model about unmanned surface vehicles clusters is provided as an example to verify the effectiveness and feasibility of the proposed approach. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85132347454&doi=10.1016%2fj.eswa.2022.117702&partnerID=40&md5=6cc3752fb798333fa4fb7caee540ea01,Expert Systems with Applications,2022
"Federated-Reinforcement-Learning-Enabled Joint Communication, Sensing, and Computing Resources Allocation in Connected Automated Vehicles Networks","For future connected automated vehicles (CAVs) networks, the joint optimization of communication, sensing, and computing resources is crucial to guarantee the performance of cooperative automated driving's safety, which is attracting more and more attention. However, the existing works have not considered the low-latency requirement for the raw perception data sharing with both wireless communication link capability and computing efficiency constraints, causing a serious threat to the cooperative automated driving's safety in CAVs networks. In this article, a vehicle-road-base station cooperation architecture is designed, and a federated reinforcement learning (FRL)-based task offloading and resource allocation algorithm in the CAVs network is proposed to reduce the task execution delay with different communication and computing constraints. The problem of execution delay minimization is theoretically formulated and analyzed under three task practical offloading modes. To adapt to the dynamic topology of the CAVs network, we design a deep reinforcement learning algorithm to achieve the optimal task offloading and resource allocation. To further reduce the data transmission overhead of the centralized reinforcement learning algorithm, the FRL-enabled algorithm is proposed to minimize the execution delay of the optimal task offloading and resource allocation among multiple CAVs. Both the simulation and hardware testbed results verify that the proposed algorithms can not only reduce the execution delay and the communication overhead but also improve the system throughput.  © 2014 IEEE.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85134216836&doi=10.1109%2fJIOT.2022.3188434&partnerID=40&md5=a41e618e22296fb7d764706e8f59a05b,IEEE Internet of Things Journal,2022
A hierarchical disturbance rejection depth tracking control of underactuated AUV with experimental verification,"This paper presents a hierarchical disturbance rejection depth tracking control scheme for the underactuated autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV) with comparative experimental results. The proposed hierarchical control scheme is constructed by two layers in the kinematics and dynamics. First, the line-of-sight (LOS) guidance is adopted to transform the depth tracking problem of the underactuated AUV into the pitch tracking in the kinematics layer, and then the adaptive line-of-sight guidance (ALOS) is proposed to estimate online and compensate for the angle of attack neglected in the traditional LOS guidance or in the presence of disturbance. Second, in order to further enhance the capability of disturbance rejection, active disturbance rejection control (ADRC) is adopted to track the desired pitch angle in the dynamics layer. In addition, a modified velocity saturation tracking differentiator (VSTD) by considering the motion characteristics of the AUV is introduced to enable the easy tuning of the control parameters and the adaptability to varying conditions in practice. Finally, a small size underactuated AUV prototype named as ARMs-AUV 1.0 is used to implement the control algorithms. Comparative experimental results are illustrated to demonstrate the effectiveness and the remarkable performance of the proposed depth tracking control scheme. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85138769400&doi=10.1016%2fj.oceaneng.2022.112458&partnerID=40&md5=2dd9978cc1e29c3e248d9d2285e9b816,Ocean Engineering,2022
An Active Perception Framework for Autonomous Underwater Vehicle Navigation Under Sensor Constraints,"Inertial navigation for autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs) is challenging because of the drift error caused by the noise and measurement errors of inertial sensors, typically packaged as an inertial measurement unit (IMU), integrated over time. To mitigate the drift error, recent AUV state estimation approaches incorporate external references or environmental information obtained from exteroceptive sensors, with increased costs and limited operational domains. For improved navigation under sensor constraints, this article proposes an active perception framework that exploits vehicle motion to estimate the flow state together with the vehicle state using IMU and depth sensors only. The proposed framework uses the estimated flow state as external information to improve vehicle state estimation. We construct a linear time-varying system for the flow state, separated from a nonlinear system for the vehicle state. This formulation allows us to analyze uniform complete observability for the flow state, which is found to depend on vehicle motion. Then, along with vehicle and flow state estimators, we design a vehicle controller to enable vehicle motion to maximize an information metric pertaining to estimation performance based on either observability or constructability Gramian for the flow state. The proposed framework is validated through simulations for a case study with a vehicle descending through the water column in a time-varying flow field. The effectiveness of the framework is demonstrated by comparing results obtained from its four implementations with those from baseline approaches without active perception.  © 1993-2012 IEEE.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85123308588&doi=10.1109%2fTCST.2021.3139307&partnerID=40&md5=0692e7e6a4a164028d5b780fcd0ca3e3,IEEE Transactions on Control Systems Technology,2022
Secure Content Delivery for Connected and Autonomous Trucks: A Coalition Formation Game Approach,"With the ever-increasing demand for the content delivery services in autonomous vehicular networks (AVNs), caching popular contents in the edge nodes in advance is expected to reduce the transmission delay. Current works on the contents cached in connected and autonomous vehicles (CAVs) or roadside units (RSUs) are facing the problems of limited caching size and high deployment cost. In this paper, by exploiting the advantages of high caching space and flexibility of truck platoons composed of connected and autonomous trucks (CATs), we propose a secure content delivery service for CATs based on coalition formation game. Firstly, in order to protect the security and privacy of content delivery services, a differential privacy model is proposed to protect the sensitive information of CATs. Meanwhile, the differential privacy model is combined with the incentive based trust evaluation model to monitor the behaviors of CATs. In the incentive based models, CATs are encouraged to improve their trust values to obtain higher utilities and find a balance between confidence levels and utilities. Moreover, a coalition formation game is established among CATs with the same driving route, in which all CATs can maximize their utilities with the formation of several minor coalitions. Finally, we conduct extensive simulations to demonstrate the effectiveness and superiority of the proposed scheme. © 2000-2011 IEEE.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85139437675&doi=10.1109%2fTITS.2022.3184973&partnerID=40&md5=0695f207eb0d919ab52642dbe1ec0b04,IEEE Transactions on Intelligent Transportation Systems,2022
Source Direction Finding and Direct Localization Exploiting UAV Array With Unknown Gain-Phase Errors,"An unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) array is composed of multiple UAVs carrying array elements, which can sense signals synchronously through a global positioning system (GPS) trigger. However, gain-phase errors caused by synchronization errors and the inconsistent complex gains of receiving array channels result in array manifold perturbation, which makes the performance of traditional localization methods degrade or even fail. In this article, two efficient algorithms for source direction finding and direct localization using a UAV array are, respectively, presented. First, the array manifold changes with the movement of UAVs, which contributes to multiposition fusion, thus avoiding the infinite solutions of underdetermined equations. Then, the quadratic optimization problem can be constructed by using the orthogonal relation between noise subspaces and contaminated steering vectors obtained from multiple observations. Thereafter, we can construct the cost function and obtain the spectral function, from which the source directions and positions can be all estimated by grid search. Meanwhile, the gain-phase error values can be solved successively. Moreover, in order to avoid the influence of heteroscedasticity of different observation positions in direct localization, we carry out a blind weighting operation. Simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness and superiority of the proposed algorithms.  © 2014 IEEE.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85131759943&doi=10.1109%2fJIOT.2022.3181450&partnerID=40&md5=5582b09623066814ae696e7ec0dfab03,IEEE Internet of Things Journal,2022
A Systematic Solution of Human Driving Behavior Modeling and Simulation for Automated Vehicle Studies,"Though automated vehicles (AVs) are believed to play a crucial role in future transport, human driving vehicles will share the road with automated vehicles for a relatively long period. So, we need to enable automated vehicles to run along with human drivers especially when they may have conflicts in the right of way. One key problem is how to appropriately model human driving behaviors and quickly simulate their actions when training/testing automated vehicles. Many existing models were originally built for traffic flow studies and may not be suitable for automated vehicles studies. In this paper, we propose a set of new principles of human driving behaviors modeling and simulations. Then, we propose a Data-Driven Simulator (D2Sim) model for human behavior learning, description, and vehicle interaction simulation. In contrast to conventional microscopic traffic flow models, the D2Sim is a trajectory generation model that accepts rich driving environment information (e.g., lane geometry, crosswalks, traffic signals, surrounding vehicles, etc.). Different from many empirical trajectory records replay models, we can arbitrarily set the long-term intentions of the simulated vehicles and intentionally design the corner cases that had not been observed in practice. In addition, the D2Sim adopts adversarial learning to comprehend complex yet stochastic human driving behaviors from empirical data. Testing results show that the proposed model can quickly generate high-resolution trajectory data for training and testing.  © 2000-2011 IEEE.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85129423223&doi=10.1109%2fTITS.2022.3170329&partnerID=40&md5=18a2f11d15c731fcb4b90267d388fec4,IEEE Transactions on Intelligent Transportation Systems,2022
SFNet-N: An Improved SFNet Algorithm for Semantic Segmentation of Low-Light Autonomous Driving Road Scenes,"In recent years, considerable progress has been made in semantic segmentation of images with favorable environments. However, the environmental perception of autonomous driving under adverse weather conditions is still very challenging. In particular, the low visibility at nighttime greatly affects driving safety. In this paper, we aim to explore image segmentation in low-light scenarios, thereby expanding the application range of autonomous vehicles. The segmentation algorithms for road scenes based on deep learning are highly dependent on the volume of images with pixel-level annotations. Considering the scarcity of labeled large-scale nighttime data, we performed synthetic data collection and data style transfer using images acquired in daytime based on the autonomous driving simulation platform and generative adversarial network, respectively. In addition, we also proposed a novel nighttime segmentation framework (SFNET-N) to effectively recognize objects in dark environments, aiming at the boundary blurring caused by low semantic contrast in low-illumination images. Specifically, the framework comprises a light enhancement network which introduces semantic information for the first time and a segmentation network with strong feature extraction capability. Extensive experiments with Dark Zurich-test and Nighttime Driving-test datasets show the effectiveness of our method compared with existing state-of-the art approaches, with 56.9% and 57.4% mIoU (mean of category-wise intersection-over-union) respectively.

Multi-scale graph learning for ovarian tumor segmentation from CT images,"Ovarian cancer is the gynecological malignant tumor with low early diagnosis rate and high mortality. Automated and reliable segmentation of ovarian tumor plays an essential role in ovarian cancer radiotherapy, which assists radiologists to assess cancer progresses and make fast therapeutic schedules. However, ovarian cancer is characterized by polycentric tumors and the tumors are irregular in size, which makes the tumor segmentation task challenging. In this paper, a multi-scale graph learning U-Net (MGLU-Net) is proposed for ovarian tumor segmentation. The network adopts an encoder-decoder architecture as the basic backbone. The feature maps of different scales generated by the encoder are projected into graphs with different sizes. On this basis, the graph learning module is designed to jointly exploit local information and long-range dependencies among ovarian tumors at different locations. Meanwhile, multiple graphs with different sizes are constructed to handle the size variation problem. A channel attention module is further designed to highlight the informative features from the channel domain.

Joint Optimization of Deployment and Trajectory in UAV and IRS-Assisted IoT Data Collection System,"Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) can be applied in many Internet of Things (IoT) systems, e.g., smart farms, as a data collection platform. However, the UAV-IoT wireless channels may be occasionally blocked by trees or high-rise buildings. An intelligent reflecting surface (IRS) can be applied to improve the wireless channel quality by smartly reflecting the signal via a large number of low-cost passive reflective elements. This article aims to minimize the energy consumption of the system by jointly optimizing the deployment and trajectory of the UAV. The problem is formulated as a mixed-integer-and-nonlinear programming (MINLP), which is challenging to address by the traditional solution, because the solution may easily fall into the local optimal. To address this issue, we propose a joint optimization framework of deployment and trajectory (JOLT), where an adaptive whale optimization algorithm (AWOA) is applied to optimize the deployment of the UAV, and an elastic ring self-organizing map (ERSOM) is introduced to optimize the trajectory of the UAV. Specifically, in AWOA, a variable-length population strategy is applied to find the optimal number of stop points, and a nonlinear parameter $a$ and a partial mutation rule are introduced to balance the exploration and exploitation. In ERSOM, a competitive neural network is also introduced to learn the trajectory of the UAV by competitive learning, and a ring structure is presented to avoid the trajectory intersection. Extensive experiments are carried out to show the effectiveness of the proposed JOLT framework.  © 2014 IEEE.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85133717276&doi=10.1109%2fJIOT.2022.3185012&partnerID=40&md5=dae7533a3bcda5ae6234b608d17ed79f,IEEE Internet of Things Journal,2022
Secure Distributed Adaptive Platooning Control of Automated Vehicles Over Vehicular Ad-Hoc Networks Under Denial-of-Service Attacks,"This article deals with the problem of secure distributed adaptive platooning control of automated vehicles over vehicular ad-hoc networks (VANETs) in the presence of intermittent denial-of-service (DoS) attacks. The platoon, which is wirelessly connected via directed vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) communication, is composed of a group of following vehicles subject to unknown heterogeneous nonlinearities and external disturbance inputs, and a leading vehicle subject to unknown nonlinearity and external disturbance as well as an unknown control input. Under such a platoon setting, this article aims to accomplish secure distributed platoon formation tracking with the desired longitudinal spacing and the same velocities and accelerations guided by the leader regardless of the simultaneous presence of nonlinearities, uncertainties, and DoS attacks. First, a new logical data packet processor is developed on each vehicle to identify the intermittent DoS attacks via verifying the time-stamps of the received data packets. Then, a scalable distributed neural-network-based adaptive control design approach is proposed to achieve secure platooning control. It is proved that under the established design procedure, the vehicle state estimation errors and platoon tracking errors can be regulated to reside in small neighborhoods around zero. Finally, comparative simulation studies are provided to substantiate the effectiveness and merits of the proposed control design approach on maintaining the desired platooning performance and attack tolerance.  © 2013 IEEE.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85107225903&doi=10.1109%2fTCYB.2021.3074318&partnerID=40&md5=ee10d88e775ad1011bdf7fbbb312e449,IEEE Transactions on Cybernetics,2022
UAVs-Aided Delay-Tolerant Blockchain Secure Offline Transactions in Post-Disaster Vehicular Networks,"Vehicular networks which are paralyzed by natural disasters is faced with communication dilemma. Through building a decentralized communication network, unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) with high mobility and flexibility are expected to be the solution to the post-disaster vehicular networks. The blockchain technology has been widely used in UAV networks to provision the prompt security of distributed communications. However, existing works ignore the dynamics of the network in that due to high mobility, distributed UAVs cannot timely connect to the backbone to synchronize blockchain transactions. The delay of synchronization can result in severe security issues. On addressing the issues, this paper proposes UAVs-aided blockchain offline transactions to ensure the security and effectiveness of delay-tolerant blockchain transactions when UAVs are offline. In specific, we consider vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) charging transactions in post-disaster vehicular networks. By establishing offline channel between charging and discharging electric vehicles (EVs) by hashed time locked contract (HTLC), we design a UAVs aided penalty algorithm with accountable assertions to prevent deposit forging attacks and double-spending attacks. In addition, considering the selfishness of EVs, a Stackelberg game based incentive scheme is developed to encourage EVs to participate the offline transactions and to improve their trust values. By suing the mechanisms above, our proposal addresses the security of offline EV charging, as well as the selfishness of participant. Using extensive simulations, we demonstrate that the proposed scheme can realize secure transactions among EVs and can effectively improve the utilities of EVs through the comparison with conventional schemes.  © 1967-2012 IEEE.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85133584948&doi=10.1109%2fTVT.2022.3184965&partnerID=40&md5=15bbce2961cbfd6e5aa1b238379491c4,IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology,2022
A double-layer coding model with a rotation-based particle swarm algorithm for unmanned combat aerial vehicle path planning,"Unmanned combat aerial vehicle (UCAV) technology has to address many challenges in complex battlefield environments. To produce a safe and low-energy flying path, a UCAV requires many points to build a path that avoids threats, which increases the problem dimension, consumes more computational resources and makes the results unstable. To address this issue, this paper employs a new model known as double-layer coding (DLC) for path planning with unevenly distributed points to decrease the number of superfluous points on the path. Meanwhile, the RPSO algorithm, which introduces a novel strategy of rotating particles in high-dimensional space to search for targets, is proposed as an enhanced particle swarm optimization (PSO) algorithm. The proposed method effectively improves PSO′s exploration capacity. Furthermore, RPSO is employed to implement the double-layer coding model for path planning (DLCRPSO). The experimental results show that the proposed DLCRPSO method for path planning always produces feasible flight paths in complex environments. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85138018608&doi=10.1016%2fj.engappai.2022.105410&partnerID=40&md5=f7b51919cd3d040ecec7dbf441e73b9a,Engineering Applications of Artificial Intelligence,2022
"Automated city shuttles: Mapping the key challenges in cybersecurity, privacy and standards to future developments","The Automated City Shuttles (ACSs) aim to shape the future public transportation and provide more efficient and accessible mobility in smart cities. With the absence of a driver, such mini-busses process the sensors’ inputs and exchanged data with other vehicles and intelligent transport systems to achieve a real time assimilation of its surroundings. Consequently, the technologies supporting the driverless functionalities ushered new cybersecurity risks and data privacy breaches. Unfortunately, several studies mostly focus on individual Connected-Automated Vehicles (CAV), though intrinsic underpinnings of the ACS's threat vectors remain unexplored. In the present paper, we considerably extend that investigation by proposing a comprehensive state of the art with farsighted analyses addressing security threats and data privacy concerns from both technical and legal perspectives to thwart potential attacks. Moreover, as existing approaches have not provided yet a clear road map about ACS's security standards, the present work sheds light on recent and up to date standards and standardisation bodies dealing with cybersecurity and privacy issues in the automated driving ecosystem. This paper presents an analysis debating the trade-off between maximising the ACS benefits and minimising the associated security vulnerabilities and attacks through an overview of technical and legal mitigation strategies. © 2022 The Author(s)",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85137274101&doi=10.1016%2fj.cose.2022.102904&partnerID=40&md5=1e2458618331d7f767f48b9e453fadb2,Computers and Security,2022
Vehicle Detection From UAV Imagery With Deep Learning: A Review,"Vehicle detection from unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) imagery is one of the most important tasks in a large number of computer vision-based applications. This crucial task needed to be done with high accuracy and speed. However, it is a very challenging task due to many characteristics related to the aerial images and the used hardware, such as different vehicle sizes, orientations, types, density, limited datasets, and inference speed. In recent years, many classical and deep-learning-based methods have been proposed in the literature to address these problems. Handed engineering- and shallow learning-based techniques suffer from poor accuracy and generalization to other complex cases. Deep-learning-based vehicle detection algorithms achieved better results due to their powerful learning ability. In this article, we provide a review on vehicle detection from UAV imagery using deep learning techniques. We start by presenting the different types of deep learning architectures, such as convolutional neural networks, recurrent neural networks, autoencoders, generative adversarial networks, and their contribution to improve the vehicle detection task. Then, we focus on investigating the different vehicle detection methods, datasets, and the encountered challenges all along with the suggested solutions. Finally, we summarize and compare the techniques used to improve vehicle detection from UAV-based images, which could be a useful aid to researchers and developers to select the most adequate method for their needs.  © 2012 IEEE.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85107176671&doi=10.1109%2fTNNLS.2021.3080276&partnerID=40&md5=f5e0cf0103457ff70fc584b9db0c7355,IEEE Transactions on Neural Networks and Learning Systems,2022
Automatic Detection and Counting System for Pavement Cracks Based on PCGAN and YOLO-MF,"The regular detection of pavement cracks is critical for life and property security. However, existing deep learning-based methods of crack detection face difficulties in terms of data acquisition and defect counting. An automatic intelligent detection and tracking system for pavement cracks is proposed. Our system is formed of a pavement crack generative adversarial network (PCGAN) and a crack detection and tracking network called YOLO-MF. First, PCGAN is used to generate realistic crack images, to address the problem of the small number of available images. Next, YOLO-MF is developed based on an improved YOLO v3 modified by an acceleration algorithm and median flow (MF) algorithm to count the number of cracks. In a counting loop, our improved YOLO v3 detects cracks and the MF algorithm tracks the cracks detected in a video. This improved algorithm achieves the best accuracy of 98.47% and F1 score of 0.958 among other algorithms, and the precision-recall curve was close to the top right. A tiny model was developed and an acceleration algorithm was applied, which improved the detection speed by factors of five and six, respectively. In on-site measurement, three cracks were detected and tracked, and the total count was correct. Finally, the system was embedded in an intelligent device consisting of a calculating module, an automated unmanned aerial vehicle, and other components. © 2000-2011 IEEE.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85127500961&doi=10.1109%2fTITS.2022.3161960&partnerID=40&md5=815332d39447ca4088c68ba6b9a6b9af,IEEE Transactions on Intelligent Transportation Systems,2022
Decomposed Task Scheduling for Security-Critical Mobile Cyber-Physical Systems,"With the recent advances in mobile sensing, computing, and communication technologies, mobile cyber-physical systems (MCPSs) become a promising networking paradigm that provides mobile users with various applications and services from cyber space to the physical world. One of the main challenges in the MCPSs is to defend security threats launched by adversaries. Exploiting security services to defend threats is energy consuming, whereas the energy of mobile devices is generally limited since most of mobile devices are battery powered. This necessitates the need to design new methodologies to tackle the tradeoff between security and energy of MCPSs. To this end, this article aims to maximize MCPSs' security under the constraints of energy and deadline. In this article, we first formulate the MCPS security maximization problem as a mixed-integer nonlinear programming (MINLP) problem and then transform it into a mixed-integer linear programming (MILP) problem without performance degradation. To solve the transformed MILP problem efficiently, we propose a decomposed algorithm to derive the optimum task scheduling solution instead of using MILP solvers that may be very time consuming for MCPSs of large granularity. The derived task scheduling solution decides the assignment, operating frequency, execution order, as well as security service selection for all tasks. We implement a series of simulation-based experiments to validate the proposed decomposed task scheduling scheme. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed scheme increases system security level by 20.38% and 65.11% on average as compared to a state-of-art approach and a baseline method.  © 2014 IEEE.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85107197088&doi=10.1109%2fJIOT.2021.3081434&partnerID=40&md5=a8aa2dfba3bd70db80f45d5cb290eb55,IEEE Internet of Things Journal,2022
Closed loop integration of air-to-air visual measurements for cooperative UAV navigation in GNSS challenging environments,"This paper discusses the integration of air-to-air visual measurements within a cooperative multi-vehicle architecture conceived to improve navigation performance of small Unmanned Aerial Vehicles in GNSS-challenging environments. The key concept is to exploit cooperation with other aircraft flying under better GNSS coverage conditions by exchanging navigation data and using a monocular camera system for relative sensing purposes. Specifically, accurate line of sight, obtained using Deep Learning-based detectors and local image analysis, are complemented with distance information achieved through an innovative shape-based passive ranging approach accounting for both the target attitude and its position in the field of view. Camera-based measurements are combined with the estimates generated by the other onboard sensors, within a customized Extended Kalman Filter in a closed loop fashion, since navigation estimates are used in feedback as hints for visual processing. An experimental flight test campaign is carried out using two quadcopters. A comparison between filter performance achievable as a function of the specific set of available information sources, i.e., bearing-only vs. line of sight and ranging, is carried out. Results show that the trade-off between correct, false, and missed detections, as well as the passive ranging accuracy allow the filter ensuring metric-level positioning error within GNSS-challenging areas. The added value of using both bearing and range measurements strongly depends on the formation geometry and the GNSS coverage conditions and can be predicted thanks to the “generalized dilution of precision”. © 2022 The Authors",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85140440544&doi=10.1016%2fj.ast.2022.107947&partnerID=40&md5=4d80838e93de3d846ed63ca43e74f1a3,Aerospace Science and Technology,2022
Adversarial Attacks and Defenses Toward AI-Assisted UAV Infrastructure Inspection,"Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) have been widely adopted to assist infrastructure inspection tasks, since they have shown their potential to benefit the inspection in terms of efficiency, cost, and safety. To improve the effectiveness of the inspection, there has been a growing focus of recent research in integrating AI techniques into UAV infrastructure inspection and has achieved promising results. However, no prior work has studied whether such integration will also introduce new security concerns, especially considering the existence of potential vulnerabilities in underlying AI models toward adversarial inputs. In this article, we perform the first study to fill this critical gap by identifying and validating the security vulnerabilities of AI models in the context of UAV infrastructure inspection with a focus on bridge infrastructure. To understand the security property of AI-assisted UAV bridge inspection, we design a two-stage approach for the construction of effective adversarial inputs, with which we successfully validate the existence of security vulnerability using dynamic analysis. Spatial constraints, physical limits, and dynamic environmental changes are taken into consideration in our analysis to make it practical in the physical world. Our evaluation results on a real-world data set show that our constructed adversarial inputs can mislead the UAV to miss detecting a significant amount of risk-prone regions by exploiting the identified vulnerability. Based on such an observation, this article also discusses the defenses based on adversarial training to improve the robustness of AI-assisted UAV bridge inspection, which has been demonstrated to be effective according to our experimental evaluation results.  © 2014 IEEE.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85139404801&doi=10.1109%2fJIOT.2022.3206276&partnerID=40&md5=3ce6a1e75494aa7488bcf4b8cb30ce3d,IEEE Internet of Things Journal,2022
OpenStreetMap-Based Autonomous Navigation With LiDAR Naive-Valley-Path Obstacle Avoidance,"OpenStreetMaps (OSM) is currently studied as the environment representation for autonomous navigation. It provides advantages such as global consistency, a heavy-less map construction process, and a wide variety of road information publicly available. However, the location of this information is usually not very accurate locally. In this paper, we present a complete autonomous navigation pipeline using OSM information as environment representation for global planning. To avoid the flaw of local low-accuracy, we offer the novel LiDAR-based Naive-Valley-Path (NVP) method that exploits the concept of 'valley' areas to infer the local path always furthest from obstacles. This behavior allows navigation always through the center of trafficable areas following the road's shape independently of OSM error. Furthermore, NVP is a naive method that is highly sample-time-efficient. This time efficiency also enables obstacle avoidance, even for dynamic objects. We demonstrate the system's robustness in our research platform BLUE, driving autonomously across the University of Alicante Scientific Park for more than 20 km with 0.24 meters of average error against the road's center with a 19.8 ms of average sample time. Our vehicle avoids static obstacles in the road and even dynamic ones, such as vehicles and pedestrians. © 2000-2011 IEEE.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85139490420&doi=10.1109%2fTITS.2022.3208829&partnerID=40&md5=4c0c30015da95c5368d3e60c1e9e2fd8,IEEE Transactions on Intelligent Transportation Systems,2022
Renewable Energy Re-Distribution via Multiscale IoT for 6G-Oriented Green Highway Management,"While recent works on investigating renewable energy sources for powering the highway offer promising solutions for sustainable environments, they are often impeded by unequal distribution of sources across the region due to variations in solar exposure and road intensity that electromagnetically and mechanically generate the energy. By exploiting viable gathering of massive renewable energy data using the Internet of Things (IoT), this paper proposes a framework for improved highway-energy management based on the unmanned aerial vehicle-assisted wireless energy re-distribution of the harvested renewable energy. Combining both massive low-rate sensing with high-speed 6G-envisioned transmission for data aggregation, the IoT architecture is of multi-scale, consisting of: i) global data exchange and analytics for energy mapping, re-distribution planning and forecasting, and ii) local data sensing and processing at individual highway lampposts for micro-energy management. The feasibility of the networked energy system is analyzed via analytical cost-reliability analyses. The cost analysis demonstrates the cost-effectiveness through the lowest Requirement of Energy and Cost of Energy for the setup and maintenance. The reliability analysis reveals the energy plus (E+) feature of the system in certain conditions with enhanced reliability in adverse weathers that impact energy generation. With multi-scale data connectivity to intelligently manage standalone renewable energy, this work puts forward a viable idea of 6G use cases with massively networked energy sensors with a vision of achieving super-connected and intelligence-equipped highways. © 2000-2011 IEEE.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85139395935&doi=10.1109%2fTITS.2022.3203208&partnerID=40&md5=41abe274291274cc45eb29a656b77731,IEEE Transactions on Intelligent Transportation Systems,2022
AdaptIDS: Adaptive Intrusion Detection for Mission-Critical Aerospace Vehicles,"Aerospace and defense industries are particularly vulnerable to cyber threats given their sensitive nature, significantly extending the consequences of security breaches to the national level. Aerospace vehicles are augmented by cooperative control, intelligent, connected, and autonomous systems. The risk against such systems is further amplified due to commonly relying on the MIL-STD-1553 communication bus developed with a high focus on reliability and fault tolerance, albeit with security as a second priority. MIL-STD-1553 (a.k.a., STANAG 3838 by NATO) is a standard that describes a serial data communication bus primarily used in aerospace vehicles for military and civilian applications, including avionics, aircraft, and spacecraft data handling. In the absence of core security measures such as authentication, authorization, and encryption, the bus connecting sensitive functions, including autopilot, GPS, fuel valve switches, and other avionics equipment, is easily vulnerable to a wide range of attacks. This paper proposes, AdaptIDS, a novel adaptive intrusion detection system as a security analytics framework for the MIL-STD-1553 communication bus. AdaptIDS mainly adopts data science principles and leverages advanced deep learning techniques (i.e., the stacking ensemble) to boost its generalization capabilities for detecting unseen patterns of attacks in the dynamic changing environment of aerospace vehicles. Extensive experiments are conducted using two datasets generated from an open-source simulation system, reflecting dynamic real-life scenarios. The evaluation results demonstrate that our solution outperforms existing solutions with high detection effectiveness of 0.99 F1-measure and computational time efficiency.  © 2000-2011 IEEE.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85141444737&doi=10.1109%2fTITS.2022.3214095&partnerID=40&md5=8eeeeb6bd169c4c13a2dd5c8b05d57e8,IEEE Transactions on Intelligent Transportation Systems,2022
A study on longitudinal motion stability of a variable-structure SWATH USV with and without twin hydrofoils,"The form-changeable unmanned surface vehicle (USV) have a high research enthusiasm due to its far-ranging applicability, strong combat capability and low operating cost. This paper constructs a variable-structure Small Waterplane Area Twin Hull (SWATH) USV with twin hydrofoils, and aims at assessing its longitudinal motion stability (LMS) in the catamaran-form state (CFS) by parametric model and CFD method. The parametric representation of the torpedo, double struts and hydrofoils was conducted by uniform B-spline curves, 3-D coordinates conversion and surface generation method. The CFD code was verified, and used to calculate the LMS of the vessel with different strut configurations, form-states and CG position. Based on numerical results, the causes of different instability behaviors were expounded. Further, the LMS of the models with and without hydrofoils was compared at Fr = 0.1–0.8, the adjustment method of fore and aft hydrofoils to sailing attitudes was explained, the rational allocation of attack angles was also offered. The results show that the slender double struts arranged at both ends of torpedo is more conducive to the LMS and resistance, the vessel should sail in the CFS of γs ≤ 10° at Fr > 0.6; the hydrofoils slightly weakens the LMS at low Fr, makes the bow appear slight updip at Fr = 0.4–0.6, but still can sails stably; adjusting attack angles can inhibit the instability, and the most effective allocation of the fore and aft hydrofoil's attack angles is linearly arranged at Fr = 0.7, 0.8, also the adjusting can reduce the upward trim at Fr = 0.9, 1.0, but the hull is lifted higher and arises the bow updip due to the free surface suction force, at this time, the attack angle's graduation should be refined to realize the finer adjustment to the dynamic trim. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85138799195&doi=10.1016%2fj.oceaneng.2022.112606&partnerID=40&md5=1a8b2fa1223da59e6adc013c5d583e3c,Ocean Engineering,2022
Detecting in-vehicle intrusion via semi-supervised learning-based convolutional adversarial autoencoders,"With the development of autonomous vehicle technology, the controller area network (CAN) bus has become the de facto standard for an in-vehicle communication system because of its simplicity and efficiency. However, without any encryption and authentication mechanisms, the in-vehicle network using the CAN protocol is susceptible to a wide range of attacks. Many studies, which are mostly based on machine learning, have proposed installing an intrusion detection system (IDS) for anomaly detection in the CAN bus system. Although machine learning methods have many advantages for IDS, previous models usually require a large amount of labeled data, which results in high time and labor costs. To handle this problem, we propose a novel semi-supervised learning-based convolutional adversarial autoencoder model in this paper. The proposed model combines two popular deep learning models: autoencoder and generative adversarial networks. First, the model is trained with unlabeled data to learn the manifolds of normal and attack patterns. Then, only a small number of labeled samples are used in supervised training. The proposed model can detect various kinds of message injection attacks, such as DoS, fuzzy, and spoofing, as well as unknown attacks. The experimental results show that the proposed model achieves the highest F1 score of 0.9984 and a low error rate of 0.1% with limited labeled data compared to other supervised methods. In addition, we show that the model can meet the real-time requirement by analyzing the model complexity in terms of the number of trainable parameters and inference time. This study successfully reduced the number of model parameters by five times and the inference time by eight times, compared to a state-of-the-art model. © 2022 The Author(s)",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85138043501&doi=10.1016%2fj.vehcom.2022.100520&partnerID=40&md5=33481f77314e83c61cbe485a984c8dfb,Vehicular Communications,2022
Automatic Jamming Signal Classification in Cognitive UAV Radios,"The integration of Cognitive Radio (CR) with Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) is an effective step towards relieving the spectrum scarcity and empowering the UAV with a high degree of intelligence. The dynamic nature of CR and the dominant line-of-sight links of UAVs poses serious security challenges and make the CR-UAV prone to a variety of attacks as malicious jamming. Joint jammer detection and automatic jammer classification is a powerful approach against the physical layer threats by identifying multiple jammers attacking the network that realize a crucial stage towards efficient interference management. This paper proposes a novel method for joint detection and automatic classification of multiple jammers attacking with different modulation schemes. The method is based on learning a representation of the radio environment encoded in a Generalized Dynamic Bayesian Network (GDBN) whilst multiple GDBN models represent various jamming signals under different modulation schemes. The CR-UAV performs multiple predictions online in parallel and evaluates multiple abnormality measurements based on a Modified Markov Jump Particle Filter (M-MJPF) to select the best-fit model that explains the detected jammer and recognize the modulation scheme accordingly. The simulated results demonstrate that the proposed GDBN-based method outperforms Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM), Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) and Stacked Autoencoder (SAE) in terms of classification accuracy and achieves a higher degree of explainability of its own decisions by interpreting causes and effects at hierarchical levels under the Bayesian learning and reasoning processes.  © 1967-2012 IEEE.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85136902815&doi=10.1109%2fTVT.2022.3199038&partnerID=40&md5=4c24913d887ecbdce46a75f0acd88c97,IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology,2022
How to Protect Key Drones in Unmanned Aerial Vehicle Networks? An SDN-Based Topology Deception Scheme,"Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) networks, consisting of flexible, low-cost as well as easily deployable UAVs, have attracted intensive research interest recently. Due to different roles of drones in a network, some drones can be recognized as more important than others. For example, in UAV-assisted wireless sensor networks, drones can be used as store-carry and forward nodes to collect data from sensors and aid communications among them. If UAVs that act as the bridge of a large number of sensors are attacked, the production efficiency will be seriously affected. However, existing work concerning about UAV network security seldom noticed the differences among drones, let alone implementing special measures for protecting key drones. Motivated by this, we focus on the security issue of UAV networks from the perspective of key drones' protection. We first analyze the distinctions of attack impacts when adopting different target selection strategies, revealing that key drones exist and it is significantly important to protect them. Then, a topology deception scheme based on software-defined networking is proposed, which can mitigate the attack impact by tempting attackers through our well-designed virtual topologies, leading to their misjudgments on the key drones. Extensive experimental results illustrate that our scheme can effectively deceive attackers and significantly mitigate the impact of targeted attacks.  © 1967-2012 IEEE.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85137607621&doi=10.1109%2fTVT.2022.3200339&partnerID=40&md5=f26f61d8b3d2d37c41c8735ca59c2732,IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology,2022
Safety Flight Control for a Quadrotor UAV Using Differential Flatness and Dual-Loop Observers,"Focusing on a quadrotor unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV), the presence of unintended actuator faults and external disturbances increases the risk of a crash. Although plenty of efforts have been devoted, how to integrate capability analysis into safety control design is still an open issue. This article presents the design of a safety control system for quadrotor UAVs. Firstly, a system capability analysis method based on a differential flatness algorithm is developed, so that the derivatives (i.e., velocity, jerk, and snap) of flight trajectory can be formulated as flat variables. A tradeoff between system capability and permissible flight maneuverability is made to avoid actuator saturation. Secondly, dual-loop nonlinear disturbance observers are exploited to identify the actuator faults and disturbances, which can thereby be handled by a cascade control scheme. Moreover, the trajectory is regenerated online at the expense of degraded flight maneuverability or even emergency landing, in view of the remaining actuator control authority. When comparing to the existing methods, the gap among safety control, trajectory generation, and system capability analysis is bridged to ameliorate practical flight safety. Finally, flight tests are carried out to demonstrate the unique merits of the proposed system. © 1982-2012 IEEE.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85122076896&doi=10.1109%2fTIE.2021.3135640&partnerID=40&md5=fc36b8c4952da2b647728db1be73cbfc,IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics,2022
Study on hydrodynamic characteristics of the disk-shaped autonomous underwater helicopter over sea-beds,"In this study, the hydrodynamic characteristics of the Autonomous Underwater Helicopter surging near the seabed are studied by numerical simulation and experiment. The influence from the cruising velocity, altitudes as well as the inclination angle of the seabed are considered. For the condition of flat seabed, the simulation shows that the seafloor mainly affects the flow field at the bottom and rear part of the AUH, which changes the pressure resistance, and consequently affects the total resistance. In addition, bulges at the top and bottom of the AUH are the cause of the abnormal lift force. For the condition of sloping seabed, at the same surging velocity and cruising height, the resistance of AUH is more than twice of the one over flat seabed, and the irregular eddy current intensity at the tail of AUH increases with the increasing slope angle. The hydrodynamic performance from simulation agrees with the findings from the water-channel experiment with the adoption of a scaled model of the vessel. It is further discovered that hydrodynamic characteristics of AUH change more obviously with the angle of attack when it is more close to the seabed. Therefore, the hydrodynamic performance of AUH near the sloping seabed can be improved by adjusting the angle of attack. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85141969569&doi=10.1016%2fj.oceaneng.2022.113132&partnerID=40&md5=face315bed28c9c77512e7325d883efa,Ocean Engineering,2022
Multi-attacks effectiveness evaluation of UUV based on wake guidance,"This study introduces an effectiveness evaluation model for multiple wake homing torpedoes carried by UUV. A wake model for maneuvering target surface warship is established. The relationships of attack time interval with the firing range of the wake homing torpedo, target velocity ratio, and chord angle of target warship are determined. The optimal advance angle of the torpedo is revised in accordance with the movement mode of the target warship, improving the hit probability of torpedo. A simulation method for the effectiveness of multiple attacks by a single unmanned underwater vehicle (UUV) is developed. Simulation results show that the attack model of UUV and wake homing torpedo is valid. The curve of attack effectiveness as it changes with firing range is obtained, and combat effectiveness under a specific firing range is evaluated. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85139728553&doi=10.1016%2fj.oceaneng.2022.112654&partnerID=40&md5=f9648a308e323206bb75b80ce451935d,Ocean Engineering,2022
Adversarial Swarm Defence Using Multiple Fixed-Wing Unmanned Aerial Vehicles,"This article proposes a coverage-based adversarial swarm defence algorithm. The defender swarm composed of fixed-wing unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) is assumed to have explosives onboard to intercept an adversarial swarm. The proposed approach consists of the following two steps: first, impact point optimization and, second, model predictive control (MPC)-based impact time control. The impact point optimization periodically optimizes impact points for the corresponding UAVs to maximize the coverage within the hostile swarm while minimizing the common impact time. The optimization domain is limited to a physically reachable area of UAVs with the common impact time. Besides, the MPC-based impact time controller is designed to ensure the multiple UAVs to arrive the generated time-varying impact points simultaneously. Numerical simulations are performed to prove the feasibility and efficiency of the proposed swarm defence algorithm.  © 1965-2011 IEEE.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85128644666&doi=10.1109%2fTAES.2022.3169127&partnerID=40&md5=3de57f1a7feef079f881c3a1cff4ad03,IEEE Transactions on Aerospace and Electronic Systems,2022
A Survey on Attack Detection and Resilience for Connected and Automated Vehicles: From Vehicle Dynamics and Control Perspective,"Recent advances in attack/anomaly detection and resilience strategies for connected and automated vehicles (CAVs) are reviewed from vehicle dynamics and control perspective. Compared to traditional vehicles, CAVs are featured in the increasing number of perception sensors, advanced intra-vehicle communication technologies, capabilities of driving automation and connectivity between single vehicles. These features bring about safety issues which are not encountered in traditional vehicle systems. One main type of these issues is the attack or anomaly launched onto the perception sensors and the communication channels. With such a consideration, this survey summarizes and reviews the existing results on attack/anomaly detection and resilience of CAVs in control frameworks. This paper reviews the results according to the positions at which the attacks/anomalies occur. These positions are divided into three categories, namely, intra-vehicle communication network, perception sensors and inter-vehicle communication network. From this perspective, the recent attack/anomaly detection and resilience results are reviewed according to different positions attacked. After reviewing existing results, some potential research directions and challenges are identified.  © 2022 IEEE.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85133757846&doi=10.1109%2fTIV.2022.3186897&partnerID=40&md5=537a94703177dd96318a39443a0d6e6d,IEEE Transactions on Intelligent Vehicles,2022
On the Performance of UAV Relaying with Reconfigurable Antenna and Media Based Modulation in the Presence of Shadowed Fading,"Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) have attracted significant interest from the academia and industry most recently. Motivated by the wide usage of UAVs, this letter considers UAV communication with reconfigurable antenna (RA) in the presence of fading and shadowing effects, which occur due to tall buildings and skyscrapers in urban areas. More precisely, RA offers to receive information through mirror activation patterns (MAPs) so that it can achieve a receive diversity with decreased error probability by using only one radio frequency chain. Also, media-based modulation (MBM) technique with MAPs can be exploited by using RAs with reduced cost. To quantify the performance of the proposed UAV system, we derive a tight upper bound for the overall error probability by considering approximated channel model based on the standardization studies. The results have shown that RAs can make the overall system more resilient to shadowing and fading effects in terms of error performance, and they are energy efficient.  © 1965-2011 IEEE.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85132789114&doi=10.1109%2fTAES.2022.3182302&partnerID=40&md5=3ea179e6d46035e951e9d9be861a2893,IEEE Transactions on Aerospace and Electronic Systems,2022
A Non-Rigid Hierarchical Discrete Grid Structure and Its Application to UAVs Conflict Detection and Path Planning,"Following the development of the unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) industry, the number of UAVs has increased significantly, and higher expectations regarding the effect of spatial path planning have been expressed. Traditional coordinate-based conflict detection and path planning methods of UAVs are highly complex and have low computational efficiency. While the conflict detection method based on the grid system can improve efficiency, the rigid grid structure of the existing local grid system or discrete global grid system is insufficient. Since the rigid structure only encodes grid cells, multiple or different size grids are required to identify UAVs in motion, further complicating path planning. The main contributions of this article are as follows. First, we proposed a nonrigid hierarchical discrete grid structure and coding method for spatial three-dimensional grids and grid data model. This method can accomplish the aggregation of any adjacent eight grids to form multiple nonrigid structures, making the original fixed relationship between parent and child grids more flexible. Second, the nonrigid grid structure optimizes the identification ability of grid vertices, grid edges, and grid faces. It has eight times the identification ability of the rigid grid structure. We exploited this structure for UAV identification with the same size grid at any position of the grid structure. Third, based on the nonrigid grid structure, an improved UAV conflict detection method and path planning method are designed. Experimental results indicate that, on an average, the efficiency of the improved conflict detection is an order of magnitude higher than that of the traditional computational detection method. The improved path planning method reduces the path length by an average of 11% compared to the single-grid planning method, and is 3.85 times more efficient than the multi-grid buffer planning method.  © 1965-2011 IEEE.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85129625710&doi=10.1109%2fTAES.2022.3170323&partnerID=40&md5=4ea532f91c3dfa5e9ba8c2c05f6605f4,IEEE Transactions on Aerospace and Electronic Systems,2022
A Coevolutionary Algorithm for Cooperative Platoon Formation of Connected and Automated Vehicles,"This paper proposes a coevolutionary algorithm to optimize longitudinal trajectories of multiple vehicles with an energy-aware non-linear objective during the cooperative platoon formation process. In this work, an adaptive encoding scheme is adopted to represent trajectories as knot vectors of parametric cubic splines, and therefore the original problem is reformulated into a constrained numerical optimization version. The number of knots can be adjusted to trade-off between the shape flexibility and computation efficiency. Further, the proposed coevolutionary algorithm decomposes the initially high-dimensional problem into smaller subproblems, significantly reducing the complexity. A hybrid evolutionary algorithm is developed as an optimizer for subproblems. Additionally, a branch-and-bound strategy and a Tabu search component are integrated into the steepest ascent hill-climbing algorithm to speed up convergences within the local exploitation phase. Numerical experiments are conducted on extensive scenarios with different platooning sizes and initial separations. Experimental results indicate the superiority of the proposed approach in optimality and stability with reasonable sub-second computation time for real-life applications.  © 1967-2012 IEEE.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85135753782&doi=10.1109%2fTVT.2022.3196366&partnerID=40&md5=9bf5ffe549c8eeb65591aaa20394c7da,IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology,2022
An adaptive neighborhood-based search enhanced artificial ecosystem optimizer for UCAV path planning,"Path planning is an essential component of the unmanned combat aerial vehicle (UCAV) system and is the precondition for achieving tasks such as aerial reconnaissance, monitoring, and fire attack. Its objective is to find a satisfactory route with full consideration of the threat area and constraints, which is a multi-constraint global optimization problem. The work proposes an adaptive neighborhood-based search enhanced artificial ecosystem optimizer (NSEAEO) to address the UCAV path planning problem. The new algorithm uses distance-fitness-based information in the consumption phase to construct an adaptive neighborhood for consumers, who choose the better individuals within the neighborhood for predation. The strategy not only facilitates a thorough search of the problem space but also enhances the global exploration capability of the algorithm. In addition, due to the lack of diversity of the population in the decomposition stage of the AEO algorithm, it is easy to fall into the local extremum. A novel updating decomposition mechanism is designed to dynamically choose the decomposition method according to the threshold in each iteration, which effectively averts insufficient diversity and increases the ability to escape from local extrema. Furthermore, to further improve the search capability of the algorithm, a quadratic interpolation (QI) operator is embedded in the AEO algorithm. The core idea is to choose three agents to match a quadratic function close to the goal function and adopt the extremum of the quadratic function to produce new agents. The above approach achieves a good balance between exploitation and exploration. The experimental results on a series of benchmark functions and UCAV path planning in complex environments demonstrate that NSEAEO outperforms other algorithms in terms of solution quality. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85134656553&doi=10.1016%2fj.eswa.2022.118047&partnerID=40&md5=7c408cf92a48f97fa806ac344acd68f3,Expert Systems with Applications,2022
Delay-Tolerant UAV-Assisted Communication: Online Trajectory Design and User Association,"UAV-assisted communication is a promising paradigm to enhance the performance of wireless networks. In this paper, we consider the network randomness in the delay-tolerant UAV-assisted communication systems. We aim to optimize both the UAV trajectory and user association in an online manner to achieve a finite queueing delay at the users' buffers with the minimum energy consumption of the UAVs. We first formulate our problem as a stochastic dynamic programming problem that integrates the future expected energy consumption and delay into its objective function and constraints, respectively. To deal with the inaccurate knowledge of future user demand and mobility, we apply the Lyapunov optimization technique and convert it into a series of online joint UAV trajectory and user association optimization problems. However, each online problem is a non-convex non-linear integer programming problem, which is very challenging to solve in general. As such, we first eliminate the coupling relationship of user association variables in each online problem. By exploiting the special graph structure of the problem, we can decompose the joint problem into inner optimization and outer optimization problems. Then, we propose the online UAV mobility and user association selection (UMUAS) scheme, which includes two steps to solve the inner and outer problems. Simulation results show that our online UMUAS scheme achieves the near-optimal performance of the energy-delay tradeoff, which also has a 44.2% improvement over the greedy scheme and a 51.3% improvement over the interference-free scheme. Moreover, it achieves the highest energy efficiency among the three benchmark schemes.  © 1967-2012 IEEE.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85135741571&doi=10.1109%2fTVT.2022.3195788&partnerID=40&md5=ac3ac3456d82ea92583d38ff53dfd9cd,IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology,2022
"Multi-UAV Trajectory Control, Resource Allocation, and NOMA User Pairing for Uplink Energy Minimization","In this work, we study the joint optimization of multiple unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs)' trajectories, power allocation, user-UAV association, and user pairing for UAV-assisted wireless networks employing the nonorthogonal multiple access (NOMA) for uplink communications. The design aims to minimize the total energy consumption of ground users while guaranteeing to successfully transmit their required amount of data to the UAV-mounted base stations. The underlying problem is a mixed-integer nonlinear program (MINLP), which is difficult to solve optimally. To tackle this problem, we derive the optimal power allocation as a function of other variables, which is used to transform the optimization problem into an equivalent form. We then propose an iterative algorithm to solve the resulting optimization problem by using the block coordinate descent (BCD) method where three subproblems are solved in each iteration and this process is repeated until convergence. Specifically, given the UAVs' trajectories and data rates, we solve the NOMA user pairing, and user-UAV association subproblem optimally by exploiting its special structure. Then, we describe how to optimize the users' data rates and tackle the UAV trajectory optimization in the second and third subproblems, respectively, by using the successive convex approximation (SCA) method. Numerical results show that our proposed algorithm can provide efficient active-inactive schedules (by setting user's transmit powers to zero), and lower energy consumption compared to an existing baseline, and an OMA-based resource allocation and UAV-trajectory optimization strategy.  © 2014 IEEE.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85134220728&doi=10.1109%2fJIOT.2022.3188867&partnerID=40&md5=1a67c57ad084229ec7c67ec576310f86,IEEE Internet of Things Journal,2022
A Behavior Decision Method Based on Reinforcement Learning for Autonomous Driving,"Autonomous driving vehicles can reduce congestion and improve safety while increasing traffic efficiency. To reflect the quality of driving more comprehensively, the driving safety, efficiency, and occupant comfort should be jointly optimized for autonomous vehicles. Furthermore, in order to cope with complicated traffic environments and achieve satisfactory driving performance, a powerful behavior decision-making module is indispensable for autonomous vehicles. Toward this end, we study a reinforcement-learning (RL)-based method to intelligently make the behavior decision in this article. A Markov decision process (MDP) model is first formulated with a comprehensive reward function, including the effects of driving safety, efficiency, and comfort. The knowledge of the surrounding vehicles is also leveraged to exploit the behavior prediction of the target vehicle. We then propose a behavior decision strategy based on the actor-critic (AC) mechanism, which can efficiently learn both a Gaussian policy function and a linear value function. Finally, the real traffic data are used to build up the simulations for evaluating the performances of the proposed method thoroughly. Simulation results show that our proposed method can significantly reduce the collision rate for autonomous vehicles.  © 2014 IEEE.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85145254032&doi=10.1109%2fJIOT.2022.3196639&partnerID=40&md5=96cb781f9cee62730ace2b23ceae61b1,IEEE Internet of Things Journal,2022
Resilient Branching MPC for Multi-Vehicle Traffic Scenarios Using Adversarial Disturbance Sequences,"An approach to resilient planning and control of autonomous vehicles in multi-vehicle traffic scenarios is proposed. The proposed method is based on model predictive control (MPC), where alternative predictions of the surrounding traffic are determined automatically such that they are intentionally adversarial to the ego vehicle. This provides robustness against the inherent uncertainty in traffic predictions. To reduce conservatism, an assumption that other agents are of no ill intent is formalized. Simulation results from highway driving scenarios show that the proposed method in real-time negotiates traffic situations out of scope for a nominal MPC approach and performs favorably to state-of-the-art reinforcement-learning approaches without requiring prior training. The results also show that the proposed method performs effectively, with the ability to prune disturbance sequences with a lower risk for the ego vehicle.  © 2022 IEEE.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85128678443&doi=10.1109%2fTIV.2022.3168772&partnerID=40&md5=f95a2535e59f66c4a15fd4e20be19727,IEEE Transactions on Intelligent Vehicles,2022
Safety Control for Quadrotor UAV Against Ground Effect and Blade Damage,"This article proposes a safety control scheme for quadrotor unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) to counteract ground effect and blade damage. The impacts of ground effect and blade damage are quantitatively analyzed in the established model. The proposed safety control scheme consists of position and attitude loops. Specifically, a proportional and derivative controller is designed as a baseline control with acceleration feedforward in the position loop. A disturbance observer (DO) using the measured Euler angles is exploited to estimate the lumped disturbance forces. The developed DO can effectively mitigate the estimation deviation caused by the angle tracking error. Subsequently, differential flatness theory is used to obtain the Euler angle references and the derivatives. In the attitude loop, sliding mode control and fixed-time sliding mode observer (SMO) are integrated to deal with ground effect and blade damage promptly. To demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed safety control scheme, flight experiments are carried out, where the quadrotor UAV flies close to the rugged ground in the presence of blade damage.  © 1982-2012 IEEE.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85122897008&doi=10.1109%2fTIE.2022.3140494&partnerID=40&md5=aef526bdbc9fa62c15370fca07369251,IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics,2022
Deep Progressive Fusion Stereo Network,"Stereo matching depth estimation for rectified image pairs is of great importance to many compute vision tasks, specifically in autonomous driving. With the flourishing of convolution neural networks, responsible depth estimation of stereo matching with artificial intelligence is the most severe challenge for autonomous driving in recent years. Previous research on end-to-end trainable stereo matching networks has usually used cascading convolution blocks with down-sampling or pooling operations to extract the unary features required for matching cost construction. Such approaches lack a reconstruction stage for increasing feature map pixel-wise alignment and strength, factors which play an important role in representing the similarity between stereo image pairs. To address this issue, in this paper, we propose the progressive fusion stereo matching network (PFSM-Net). We exploit an encoder-decoder feature extraction network architecture for multi-stage and -scale dynamic feature extraction. Moreover, we propose a group-wise concatenation method to construct the cost volume, which provides a more efficient cost volume for cost aggregation. Furthermore, we propose the use of multi-scale cost aggregation networks with a progressive fusion strategy. The aggregated cost volume is progressively fused with the multi-stage and -scale cost volume as the size of the cost volume increases. Multi-stage and -scale outputs are supervised with and learned in a coarse-to-fine manner. Experimental results demonstrate that our method outperforms previous methods on the SceneFlow, KITTI 2012, and KITTI 2015 datasets.  © 2000-2011 IEEE.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85121765629&doi=10.1109%2fTITS.2021.3134416&partnerID=40&md5=9421bf953f71115eb12c973694dd00a7,IEEE Transactions on Intelligent Transportation Systems,2022
PcGAN: A Noise Robust Conditional Generative Adversarial Network for One Shot Learning,"Traffic sign classification plays a vital role in autonomous vehicles for its powerful capability in information representation. However, the low-quality data of traffic signs captured by in-vehicle cameras often inevitably bring inherent challenges to the one-shot classification task. Apart from the problem of data degradation, learning-based classification techniques of real traffic signs also come across the challenges of intra-class and inter-class data imbalance from the training data. To overcome the aforementioned problems, we propose an end-to-end degradation robust deep model, termed PcGAN, to classify traffic signs in a manner of few-shot learning. The proposed PcGAN models the joint distribution between the degraded traffic signal data and the corresponding prototypes from both degradation removal and generation perspectives by two alternating optimized modules, which ensures the generalization of the learned embedding of latent space for novel tasks. A multi-task loss function is designed to improve the robustness of PcGAN. Numerous experiments comprehensively demonstrate that the accuracy of our proposed PcGAN is improved by 5% compared with other state-of-the-art (SOTA) approaches in few-shot classification. © 2000-2011 IEEE.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85137573743&doi=10.1109%2fTITS.2022.3199805&partnerID=40&md5=55002d043317e85e3c4d4cc3f1b512ff,IEEE Transactions on Intelligent Transportation Systems,2022
UnfairGAN: An enhanced generative adversarial network for raindrop removal from a single image,"Image deraining is a new challenging problem in real-world applications, such as autonomous vehicles. In a bad weather condition of heavy rainfall, raindrops, mainly hitting glasses or windshields, can significantly reduce observation ability. Moreover, raindrops spreading over the glass can yield refraction's physical effect, which seriously impedes the sightline or undermine machine learning systems. In this paper, we propose an enhanced generative adversarial network to deal with the challenging problems of raindrops. UnfairGAN is an enhanced generative adversarial network that can utilize prior high-level information, such as edges and rain estimation, to boost deraining performance. UnfairGAN can effectively conserve the essential details caused by heavy raindrops and remove artifacts caused by the instability of training the discriminator. This method is based on three main primary advantages. First, UnfairGAN consists of an advanced loss function of the discriminator that can improve the instabilities of traditional GAN. Second, UnfairGAN comprises a new advanced activation function that is able to increase the learning effectiveness of image classification and reconstruction. Finally, UnfairGAN is basically built on a new end-to-end cascade network, namely DRD-UNet, used to probe hierarchical features for image restoration effectively. When evaluating competing methods on the well-known Raindrop dataset, we achieve a peak signal-to-noise ratio value of 31.56 while retaining the essential details in the image. Besides, we introduce a new large image dataset (DeepRaindrops) for training deep learning networks of removing raindrops. In this dataset, our proposed method is superior to other state-of-the-art approaches of deraining raindrops regarding quantitative metrics and visual quality.

Attacks on Formation Control for Multiagent Systems,"Multiagent systems (MASs) are distributed systems with two or more intelligent agents. Formation control is a significant control technique of MASs. To date, formation control on MASs is widely used in various fields, such as robots, spacecrafts, satellites, and unmanned aerial/surface/underwater vehicles. However, there is a relatively small body of literature that is concerned with security problems of formation control on MASs in past years. Our research represents the first step toward developing security attacks of formation control on MASs. Our study aims to investigate potential security problems of formation control on a multirobot system for the first time. We propose two kinds of control-level attacks and each kind of attack includes several specific attack forms. Then, we discuss specific features of formation control on a classical multirobot system and utilize theoretical analyses to illustrate how cyberattacks can influence the physical movements of robots.

Securing Transmission for UAV Swarm-Enabled Communication Network,"Deploying unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) in communication networks could achieve desirable degrees of freedom, but resulting from the high line-of-sight link attributes, security threats faced by UAV communications are serious. Taking that into consideration, we focus on a UAV swarm-enabled communication network in this article, where a fixed-wing UAV acts as a legitimate user and a neighboring UAV eavesdropper attempts to eavesdrop the confidential information forwarded by rotary-wing UAV relays. In particular, we jointly optimize transmit power on the base station and UAV relays, power allocation coefficient and beamforming on UAV relays, and trajectory of the fixed-wing UAV to maximize the average secrecy rate. Due to the nonconvexity of the optimization problem, the block coordinate descent method is utilized to solve it. Specifically, the overall optimizing problem is divided into four subproblems in which the transmit power, power allocation coefficient, beamforming vector, and the trajectory of user are optimized, respectively. By employing the successive convex approximate method, subproblems are transformed to convex problems which are numerically tractable. Numerical simulations validate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm and show that compared with benchmark schemes, the considered transmission scheme with artificial noise and optimized network parameters can improve secrecy rate by about 13.8%.  © 2007-2012 IEEE.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85118621430&doi=10.1109%2fJSYST.2021.3111746&partnerID=40&md5=370534c9c9de08df2d24b2fe9b05731a,IEEE Systems Journal,2022
Intelligent Event-Based Fuzzy Dynamic Positioning Control of Nonlinear Unmanned Marine Vehicles Under DoS Attack,"This article addresses the dynamic positioning control problem of a nonlinear unmanned marine vehicle (UMV) system subject to network communication constraints and deny-of-service (DoS) attack, where the dynamics of UMV are described by a Takagi-Sugeno (T-S) fuzzy system (TSFS). In order to save limited communication resource, a new intelligent event-triggering mechanism is proposed, in which the event triggering threshold is optimized by a Q -learning algorithm. Then, a switched system approach is proposed to deal with the aperiodic DoS attack occurring in the communication channels. With a proper piecewise Lyapunov function, some sufficient conditions for global exponential stability (GES) of the closed-loop nonlinear UMV system are derived, and the corresponding observer and controller gains are designed via solving a set of matrix inequalities.

A Sensor Fusion-Based GNSS Spoofing Attack Detection Framework for Autonomous Vehicles,"This paper presents a sensor fusion-based Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) spoofing attack detection framework for autonomous vehicles (AVs) that consists of two strategies: (i) comparison between predicted location shift - i.e., distance traveled between two consecutive timestamps - and inertial sensor based location shift in addition to monitoring of vehicle motion states - i.e., standstill/ in motion; and (ii) detection and classification of turns (left or right) along with detection of vehicle motion states. In the first strategy, data from low-cost in-vehicle inertial sensors - i.e., speedometer, accelerometer, and steering angle sensor - are fused and fed to a long short-term memory (LSTM) neural network to predict the distance an AV will travel between two consecutive timestamps. The second strategy combines k-Nearest Neighbors (k-NN) and Dynamic Time Warping (DTW) algorithms to detect a turn and then classify left and right turns using steering angle sensor output. In both strategies, the GNSS-derived speed is compared with speedometer output to improve the effectiveness of the framework presented in this paper. To prove the efficacy of the sensor fusion-based attack detection framework, attack datasets are created for four unique spoofing attack scenarios - turn-by-turn, overshoot, wrong turn, and stop, using the publicly available real-world Honda Research Institute Driving Dataset (HDD). Analyses conducted in this study reveal that the sensor fusion-based detection framework successfully detects all four types of spoofing attacks within the required computational latency threshold. © 2000-2011 IEEE.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85137605583&doi=10.1109%2fTITS.2022.3197817&partnerID=40&md5=194ad4e6db4c6b941579482128e30e66,IEEE Transactions on Intelligent Transportation Systems,2022
Data Augmentation and Intelligent Recognition in Pavement Texture Using a Deep Learning,"As one of the most important properties of road, the adaption to roads with different macro-textures may significantly affect the autonomous driving technologies since road texture directly affects the skidding resistance and tire noise. Therefore, it is of great significance to detect and analyze the road macro texture with respect to different pavement types and service conditions. Generally, transportation engineers may face problems such as small dataset size, unbalanced dataset, etc. To solve these problems, this study aims to recognize the pavement texture using the deep learning approaches. The pavement texture data was first visualized using image processing methods, and then augmented using the traditional methods as well as a deep learning approach, i.e. Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) model. The Random Forest (RF) algorithm and the DenseNet network were both employed, where the overall classification accuracy of the original dataset was 50% and 59%, respectively, and the accuracy of the data augmented by the traditional methods was 58% and 70%, respectively. Test results show that, after 250,000 generations of training, GAN model was able to generate new pavement texture images with high quality, and the classification accuracy on the test dataset using DenseNet improved to 82%. It was discovered that the deep learning methods had a better performance for pavement texture recognition than manual classification and traditional machine learning methods. Furthermore, it was also found that adding noise in the original datasets as an augmentation method had a negative impact on the classification accuracy.  © 2000-2011 IEEE.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85123783241&doi=10.1109%2fTITS.2022.3140586&partnerID=40&md5=cf357df2663c1efc0ad75188362f3ba6,IEEE Transactions on Intelligent Transportation Systems,2022
An Enhanced Multi-Stage Deep Learning Framework for Detecting Malicious Activities From Autonomous Vehicles,"Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS), particularly Autonomous Vehicles (AVs), are susceptible to safety and security concerns that impend people's lives. Nothing like manually controlled vehicles, the safekeeping of communications and computing constituents of AVs can be threatened using sophisticated hacking techniques, consequently disrupting AVs from the operative usage in our daily life routines. Once manually controlled vehicles are linked to the Internet, so-called the Internet of Vehicles (IoVs), they would be misused by cyberattacks. In this paper, we present a multi-stage intrusion detection framework to identify intrusions from ITSs and produce low rate of false alarms. The proposed framework can automatically distinguish intrusions in real-time. The proposed framework is based on normal state-based and a deep learning-centered bidirectional Long Short Term Memory (LSTM) architecture to efficiently discover intrusions from the fundamental network gateways and communication networks of AVs. The designed framework is evaluated through two benchmark datasources, that is, the UNSWNB-15 datasource for exterior network communications and the car hacking datasource for in-vehicle communications. The outcomes indicated that the proposed framework achieves high performance that outperforms various current state-of-the-art systems with an accuracy rate of 98.88% for the UNSWNB-15 dataset and 99.11% for the car hacking dataset. Besides, the proposed framework is furthermore capable to detect zero-day (concealed) outbreaks from IoVs networks.  © 2022 IEEE.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85113334564&doi=10.1109%2fTITS.2021.3105834&partnerID=40&md5=ca23655be5ad5cada077691447e99f45,IEEE Transactions on Intelligent Transportation Systems,2022
CAT: Closed-loop Adversarial Training for Safe End-to-End Driving,"Driving safety is a top priority for autonomous vehicles. Orthogonal to prior work handling accident-prone traffic events by algorithm designs at the policy level, we investigate a Closed-loop Adversarial Training (CAT) framework for safe end-to-end driving in this paper through the lens of environment augmentation. CAT aims to continuously improve the safety of driving agents by training the agent on safety-critical scenarios that are dynamically generated over time. A novel resampling technique is developed to turn log-replay real-world driving scenarios into safety-critical ones via probabilistic factorization, where the adversarial traffic generation is modeled as the multiplication of standard motion prediction sub-problems. Consequently, CAT can launch more efficient physical attacks compared to existing safety-critical scenario generation methods and yields a significantly less computational cost in the iterative learning pipeline. We incorporate CAT into the MetaDrive simulator and validate our approach on hundreds of driving scenarios imported from real-world driving datasets. Experimental results demonstrate that CAT can effectively generate adversarial scenarios countering the agent being trained. After training, the agent can achieve superior driving safety in both log-replay and safety-critical traffic scenarios on the held-out test set.

Generating Transferable Adversarial Simulation Scenarios for Self-Driving via Neural Rendering,"Self-driving software pipelines include components that are learned from a significant number of training examples, yet it remains challenging to evaluate the overall system's safety and generalization performance. Together with scaling up the real-world deployment of autonomous vehicles, it is of critical importance to automatically find simulation scenarios where the driving policies will fail. We propose a method that efficiently generates adversarial simulation scenarios for autonomous driving by solving an optimal control problem that aims to maximally perturb the policy from its nominal trajectory. Given an image-based driving policy, we show that we can inject new objects in a neural rendering representation of the deployment scene, and optimize their texture in order to generate adversarial sensor inputs to the policy. We demonstrate that adversarial scenarios discovered purely in the neural renderer (surrogate scene) can often be successfully transferred to the deployment scene, without further optimization. We demonstrate this transfer occurs both in simulated and real environments, provided the learned surrogate scene is sufficiently close to the deployment scene. © 2023 Proceedings of Machine Learning Research.

The industry typically relies on closed-loop simulation to evaluate how the SDV interacts on a corpus of synthetic and real scenarios and verify it performs properly. However, they primarily only test the system's motion planning module, and only consider behavior variations. It is key to evaluate the full autonomy system in closed-loop, and to understand how variations in sensor data based on scene appearance, such as the shape of actors, affect system performance. In this paper, we propose a framework, ADV3D, that takes real world scenarios and performs closed-loop sensor simulation to evaluate autonomy performance, and finds vehicle shapes that make the scenario more challenging, resulting in autonomy failures and uncomfortable SDV maneuvers. Unlike prior works that add contrived adversarial shapes to vehicle roof-tops or roadside to harm perception only, we optimize a low-dimensional shape representation to modify the vehicle shape itself in a realistic manner to degrade autonomy performance (e.g., perception, prediction, and motion planning). Moreover, we find that the shape variations found with ADV3D optimized in closed-loop are much more effective than those in open-loop, demonstrating the importance of finding scene appearance variations that affect autonomy in the interactive setting.

Deception Game: Closing the Safety-Learning Loop in Interactive Robot Autonomy,"An outstanding challenge for the widespread deployment of robotic systems like autonomous vehicles is ensuring safe interaction with humans without sacrificing performance. Existing safety methods often neglect the robot's ability to learn and adapt at runtime, leading to overly conservative behavior. This paper proposes a new closed-loop paradigm for synthesizing safe control policies that explicitly account for the robot's evolving uncertainty and its ability to quickly respond to future scenarios as they arise, by jointly considering the physical dynamics and the robot's learning algorithm. We leverage adversarial reinforcement learning for tractable safety analysis under high-dimensional learning dynamics and demonstrate our framework's ability to work with both Bayesian belief propagation and implicit learning through large pre-trained neural trajectory predictors. © 2023 Proceedings of Machine Learning Research.

BM2CP: Efficient Collaborative Perception with LiDAR-Camera Modalities,"Collaborative perception enables agents to share complementary perceptual information with nearby agents. This would improve the perception performance and alleviate the issues of single-view perception, such as occlusion and sparsity. Most existing approaches mainly focus on single modality (especially LiDAR), and not fully exploit the superiority of multi-modal perception. We propose a collaborative perception paradigm, BM2CP, which employs LiDAR and camera to achieve efficient multi-modal perception. It utilizes LiDAR-guided modal fusion, cooperative depth generation and modality-guided intermediate fusion to acquire deep interactions among modalities of different agents, Moreover, it is capable to cope with the special case where one of the sensors, same or different type, of any agent is missing. Extensive experiments validate that our approach outperforms the state-of-the-art methods with 50× lower communication volumes in both simulated and real-world autonomous driving scenarios.

Prediction based Auto-Pilot Interface for Drone to Object Chasing using Historical TSPI Data,"Replacing military aircraft with Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAV) offers advantages such as reducing costs and risks associated with conventional military aircraft. To defend against enemy UAV attacks, anti-drone systems are used. While most technologies focus on drone detection, this paper proposes a process of tracking targets using arbitrary UAV to enhance camera data quality or directly engage and neutralize targets. The system comprises drone detection, movement prediction, and chasing. Devices such as radar are used to detect drones, and they provide Time-Space-Position Information (TSPI) using suitable data formats. Using Machine Learning (ML) techniques make it feasible to predict an object's future location, represented with equations. Utilizing trained machine learning models, the Auto-pilot Application Programming Interface (API) of the drone is employed to track based on the predicted results. Through experiments, the feasibility of predicting an object's future location using various ML techniques has been confirmed. Furthermore, verification has been conducted to establish the attainability of implementing the Auto-pilot API through the utilization of DJI's API.  © 2023 ICROS.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85179182344&doi=10.23919%2fICCAS59377.2023.10316981&partnerID=40&md5=b5e015e99b46d2763f7e4c5154563658,"International Conference on Control, Automation and Systems",2023
Attak Detection in RSU-OBU Communication Using Deep Neural Network,This paper proposes three types of neural network-based attack detectors for Internet of Vehicles (IoV) networks. The proposed attack detectors consist of Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) layers. The fault detector is implemented in the Road Side Unit (RSU) that communicates with On Board Unit (OBU) installed in the autonomous vehicles. We consider the multiplicative attacks in the RSU-OBU communication messages. The training and validation data sets are generated by using an automated driving toolbox in MATLAB. Attack detector performance is evaluated using the validation data set that is not included in the training data sets.

AST-SafeSec: Adaptive Stress Testing for Safety and Security Co-Analysis of Cyber-Physical Systems,"Cyber-physical systems are becoming more intelligent with the adoption of heterogeneous sensor networks and machine learning capabilities that deal with an increasing amount of input data. While this complexity aims to solve problems in various domains, it adds new challenges for the system assurance. One issue is the rise in the number of abnormal behaviors that affect system performance due to possible sensor faults and attacks. The combination of safety risks, which are usually caused by random sensor faults and security risks that can happen during any random system state, makes the full coverage testing of the cyber-physical system challenging. Existing techniques are inadequate to deal with complex safety and security co-risks against cyber-physical systems. In this paper, we propose AST-SafeSec, an analysis methodology for both safety and security aspects that utilizes reinforcement learning to identify the most likely adversarial paths at various normal or failure states of a cyber-physical system that can influence system behavior through its sensor data. The methodology is evaluated using an autonomous vehicle scenario by incorporating a security attack into the stochastic sensor elements of a vehicle. Evaluation results show that the methodology analyzes the interaction of malicious attacks with random faults and identifies the incident caused by the interactions and the most likely path that leads to the incident.  © 2005-2012 IEEE.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85169702135&doi=10.1109%2fTIFS.2023.3309160&partnerID=40&md5=13273de334d902036aa5c7803992c37b,IEEE Transactions on Information Forensics and Security,2023
Particle-Based Score Estimation for State Space Model Learning in Autonomous Driving,"Multi-object state estimation is a fundamental problem for robotic applications where a robot must interact with other moving objects. Typically, other objects' relevant state features are not directly observable, and must instead be inferred from observations. Particle filtering can perform such inference given approximate transition and observation models. However, these models are often unknown a priori, yielding a difficult parameter estimation problem since observations jointly carry transition and observation noise. In this work, we consider learning maximum-likelihood parameters using particle methods. Recent methods addressing this problem typically differentiate through time in a particle filter, which requires workarounds to the non-differentiable resampling step, that yield biased or high variance gradient estimates. By contrast, we exploit Fisher's identity to obtain a particle-based approximation of the score function (the gradient of the log likelihood) that yields a low variance estimate while only requiring stepwise differentiation through the transition and observation models. We apply our method to real data collected from autonomous vehicles (AVs) and show that it learns better models than existing techniques and is more stable in training, yielding an effective smoother for tracking the trajectories of vehicles around an AV. © 2023 Proceedings of Machine Learning Research.

Verified Path Following Using Neural Control Lyapunov Functions,"We present a framework that uses control Lyapunov functions (CLFs) to implement provably stable path-following controllers for autonomous mobile platforms. Our approach is based on learning a guaranteed CLF for path following by using recent approaches - combining machine learning with automated theorem proving - to train a neural network feedback law along with a CLF that guarantees stabilization for driving along low-curvature reference paths. We discuss how key properties of the CLF can be exploited to extend the range of the curvatures for which the stability guarantees remain valid. We then demonstrate that our approach yields a controller that obeys theoretical guarantees in simulation, but also performs well in practice. We show our method is both a verified method of control and better than a common MPC implementation in computation time. Additionally, we implement the controller on-board on a 1/8-scale autonomous vehicle testing platform and present results for various robust path following scenarios. © 2023 Proceedings of Machine Learning Research.

Bayesian Reinforcement Learning for Single-Episode Missions in Partially Unknown Environments,"We consider planning for mobile robots conducting missions in real-world domains where a priori unknown dynamics affect the robot's costs and transitions. We study single-episode missions where it is crucial that the robot appropriately trades off exploration and exploitation, such that the learning of the environment dynamics is just enough to effectively complete the mission. Thus, we propose modelling unknown dynamics using Gaussian processes, which provide a principled Bayesian framework for incorporating online observations made by the robot, and using them to predict the dynamics in unexplored areas. We then formulate the problem of mission planning in Markov decision processes under Gaussian process predictions as Bayesian model-based reinforcement learning. This allows us to employ solution techniques that plan more efficiently than previous Gaussian process planning methods are able to. We empirically evaluate the benefits of our formulation in an underwater autonomous vehicle navigation task and robot mission planning in a realistic simulation of a nuclear environment. © 2023 Proceedings of Machine Learning Research.

Resilient Adaptive Finite-Time Fault-Tolerant Control for Heterogeneous Uncertain and Nonlinear Autonomous Connected Vehicles Platoons,"This paper addresses the control problem of heterogeneous uncertain nonlinear autonomous vehicle platoons in the presence of adversarial threats arising in Vehicular Ad-hoc NETworks (VANET) during the information sharing process. As unpredictable faults and/or malicious attacks may affect the trustworthiness of the messages shared among vehicles, a suitable resilient control law, able to enhance the robustness of the platoon formation, is required for the prevention of dangerous events. With the aim of achieving a safe platoon control, we leverage Multi-Agent System (MAS) framework and we design a novel distributed backstepping finite-time control strategy, embedding adaptive mechanisms able to guarantee vehicles fleet resilience with respect to possible occurring faults. The proposed strategy falls into the passive fault-tolerant control framework and, hence, it does not require additional observers for fault detection and isolation, thus reducing the computational burden. Adaptive mechanisms are designed according to Lyapunov-based theory which, in combination with the Barbalat lemma, ensures the stability of the closed-loop vehicular network. More specifically, our approach allows guaranteeing the convergence towards zero of the spacing and speed errors, while ensuring that all adaptive signals are bounded in a finite-time interval. A detailed simulation analysis, including a comparison w.r.t. the technical literature, confirms the theoretical derivation, the effectiveness and the advantages of the proposed resilient control law in ensuring platoon formation for different driving scenarios despite the occurrence of unexpected faults. © 2020 IEEE.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85163717768&doi=10.1109%2fOJITS.2023.3290815&partnerID=40&md5=6dab925436774ae2ab68261c1729ae9d,IEEE Open Journal of Intelligent Transportation Systems,2023
Safety-Enhanced Autonomous Driving Using Interpretable Sensor Fusion Transformer,"Large-scale deployment of autonomous vehicles has been continually delayed due to safety concerns. On the one hand, comprehensive scene understanding is indispensable, a lack of which would result in vulnerability in rare but complex traffic situations, such as the sudden emergence of unknown objects. However, reasoning from a global context requires access to sensors of multiple types and adequate fusion of these multi-modal sensor signals, which is difficult to achieve. On the other hand, the lack of interpretability in learning models also hampers the safety with unverifiable failure causes. In this paper, we propose a safety-enhanced autonomous driving framework, named Interpretable Sensor Fusion Transformer (InterFuser), to fully process and fuse information from multi-modal multi-view sensors for comprehensive scene understanding and adversarial event detection. Besides, intermediate interpretable features are generated from our framework, which provide more semantics and are exploited to better constrain actions to be within the safe sets. We conducted extensive experiments on CARLA benchmarks, where our model outperforms prior methods, ranking #1 on the public CARLA Leaderboard. Code is made available to facilitate further research. © 2023 Proceedings of Machine Learning Research.

Synthesizing Adversarial Visual Scenarios for Model-Based Robotic Control,"Today's robots usually interface data-driven perception and planning models with classical model-predictive controllers (MPC). Often, such learned perception/planning models produce erroneous waypoint predictions on out-of-distribution (OoD) or even adversarial visual inputs, which increase control cost. However, today's methods to train robust perception models are largely task-agnostic - they augment a dataset using random image transformations or adversarial examples targeted at the vision model in isolation. As such, they may introduce pixel perturbations that are ultimately benign for control. In contrast to prior work that synthesizes adversarial examples for single-step vision tasks, our key contribution is to synthesize adversarial scenarios tailored to multi-step, model-based control. To do so, we use differentiable MPC methods to calculate the sensitivity of a model-based controller to errors in state estimation. We show that re-training vision models on these adversarial datasets improves control performance on OoD test scenarios by up to 36.2% compared to standard task-agnostic data augmentation. We demonstrate our method on examples of robotic navigation, manipulation in RoboSuite, and control of an autonomous air vehicle. © 2023 Proceedings of Machine Learning Research.

The Art of Defense: Letting Networks Fool the Attacker,"3D perception of objects is critical for many real-world applications, such as autonomous cars and robots. Among them, most state-of-the-art (SOTA) 3D perception systems are based on deep learning models. Recently, the research community found that 3D object classifiers on point cloud based on deep learning are easily fooled by adversarial point cloud craft by attackers. To overcome this, adversarial defenses are considered the most effective ways to improve the robustness of deep learning models, and most adversarial defenses on point cloud are focused on input transformation. However, all previous defense methods decrease the natural accuracy, and the nature of the point cloud classifiers itself has been overlooked. To this end, in this paper, we propose a novel adversarial defense for 3D point cloud classifiers that makes full use of the nature of the point cloud classifiers. Due to the disorder of point cloud, all point cloud classifiers have the property of permutation invariant to the input point cloud. Based on this nature, we design invariant transformations defense (IT-Defense). We show that, even after accounting for obfuscated gradients, our IT-Defense is a resilient defense against SOTA 3D attacks. Moreover, IT-Defense does not hurt clean accuracy compared to previous SOTA 3D defenses. Our code will be available at: https://github.com/cuge1995/ IT-Defense.  © 2005-2012 IEEE.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85161008487&doi=10.1109%2fTIFS.2023.3278458&partnerID=40&md5=3f1c72363c2939a0b18cf871a9e9f4e2,IEEE Transactions on Information Forensics and Security,2023
Jamming the Relay-Assisted Multi-User Wireless Communication System: A Zero-Sum Game Approach,"Recently, various wireless Internet-of-Things devices and unmanned aerial vehicles have been frequently used to facilitate daily life. On the other hand, they can also pose serious threats to public security if maliciously used. A countermeasure against these threats is to transmit jamming signals to break the communication links between attacker and wireless devices. However, this is not easy since modern multi-device (multi-user) wireless communication systems are smart in avoiding jamming. Moreover, a relay is widely used to improve the jamming resistance. To successfully jam those malicious devices, we consider a jamming and anti-jamming zero-sum game, in which the attacker tries to maximize the sum-rate of a relay-assisted wireless system and the jammer tries to minimize it. Finding the equilibrium is challenging due to its non-convexity and complex structure. We address this problem in two cases. Specifically, in the single-device (single-user) case, we show that putting the whole jamming power to either relay or device achieves the Nash equilibrium. In the multi-device case, an efficient method is developed, which transforms this game into a min-max optimization problem and decouples it into two sub-problems by the hybrid block successive approximation method. The resultant sub-problems are solved by the multi-block alternating direction method of multipliers and the block successive upper-bound minimization method of multipliers, respectively. Then, a stationary point of the original problem can be iteratively achieved. Numerical results demonstrate that the two proposed jamming methods outperform many traditional methods.  © 2005-2012 IEEE.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85161349626&doi=10.1109%2fTIFS.2023.3277222&partnerID=40&md5=023b7f35f6e9b4b375bfd6a1e2e55b14,IEEE Transactions on Information Forensics and Security,2023
AdvDDoS: Zero-Query Adversarial Attacks Against Commercial Speech Recognition Systems,"Automatic speech recognition (ASR) has been widely and commercially employed in health care, autonomous vehicles, and finance. Yet, recent studies have shown that universal adversarial perturbations (UAPs) pose a serious threat to white-box ASR systems when the adversary has access to the target model. Until now, the impacts of such a threat on commercial systems are still open since their models are not publicly available. To understand the security weakness in the practical black-box setting, this paper introduces the first zero-query UAP attacks, called AdvDDoS, with black-box access to ASR systems: we do not need to pay any query expense to estimate UAPs. Specifically, we craft targeted UAPs under a popular feature extractor and a local ASR model by reversing the robust target-category features, in which adversarial perturbations containing robust features are believed to have better transferability. Compared with vanilla UAPs, our UAPs incorporated with target-category features lead to better attacks against commercial ASR systems. We validate the efficacy of our AdvDDoS by launching attacks against a range of commercial ASR systems, i.e., three API services (Alibaba, Tencent, and Baidu), and three personal assistants (Apple Siri, iFlytek, and Google). Extensive experimental results demonstrate the superiority of AdvDDoS. For example, AdvDDoS achieves 83.26% word error rate (WER) and 53.25% success rates of attacks (SRoA) for the universal attack against Tencent ASR API, which outperforms the vanilla UAPs by up to 61.56% on WER and 11.6% on SRoA. The success of our attack sheds light on zero-query UAP attacks against commercial ASR systems.  © 2005-2012 IEEE.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85161601076&doi=10.1109%2fTIFS.2023.3283915&partnerID=40&md5=a8bfb956aec27b61f3a523936dbfd144,IEEE Transactions on Information Forensics and Security,2023
ETD: An Efficient Time Delay Attack Detection Framework for UAV Networks,"In recent years, Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) networks are widely used in both military and civilian scenarios. However, due to the distributed nature, they are also vulnerable to threats from adversaries. Time delay attack is a type of internal attack which maliciously delays the transmission of data packets and further causes great damage to UAV networks. Furthermore, it is easy to implement and difficult to detect due to the avoidance of packet modification and the unique characteristics of UAV networks. However, to the best of our knowledge, there is no research on time delay attack detection in UAV networks. In this paper, we propose an Efficient Time Delay Attack Detection Framework (ETD). First, we collect and select delay-related features from four different dimensions, namely delay, node, message and connection. Meanwhile, we utilize the pre-planned trajectory information to accurately calculate the real forwarding delay of nodes. Then, one-class classification is used to train the detection model, and the forwarding behaviors of all nodes can be evaluated, based on which their trust values can be obtained. Finally, the K-Means clustering method is used to distinguish malicious nodes from benign ones according to their trust values. Through extensive simulation, we demonstrate that ETD can achieve higher than 80% detection accuracy with less than 2.5% extra overhead in various settings of UAV networks and different routing protocols.  © 2005-2012 IEEE.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85159839549&doi=10.1109%2fTIFS.2023.3272862&partnerID=40&md5=096eb398958fe56cc6395a0e3233c950,IEEE Transactions on Information Forensics and Security,2023
Resilient Path Planning for UAVs in Data Collection Under Adversarial Attacks,"In this paper, we investigate jamming-resilient UAV path planning strategies for data collection in Internet of Things (IoT) networks, in which the typical UAV can learn the optimal trajectory to elude such jamming attacks. Specifically, the typical UAV is required to collect data from multiple distributed IoT nodes under collision avoidance, mission completion deadline, and kinematic constraints in the presence of jamming attacks. We first design a fixed ground jammer with continuous jamming attack and periodical jamming attack strategies to jam the link between the typical UAV and IoT nodes. Defensive strategies involving a reinforcement learning (RL) based virtual jammer and the adoption of higher SINR thresholds are proposed to counteract against such attacks. Secondly, we design an intelligent UAV jammer, which utilizes the RL algorithm to choose actions based on its observation. Then, an intelligent UAV anti-jamming strategy is constructed to deal with such attacks, and the optimal trajectory of the typical UAV is obtained via dueling double deep Q-network (D3QN). Simulation results show that both non-intelligent and intelligent jamming attacks have significant influence on the UAV's performance, and the proposed defense strategies can recover the performance close to that in no-jammer scenarios.  © 2005-2012 IEEE.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85153392551&doi=10.1109%2fTIFS.2023.3266699&partnerID=40&md5=98b522ba76243c8ceea9e0173f79d2c5,IEEE Transactions on Information Forensics and Security,2023
A Defensive Strategy Against Beam Training Attack in 5G mmWave Networks for Manufacturing,"Millimeter-wave (mmWave) carriers are an essential building block of fifth-generation (5G) systems. Satisfactory performance of the communications over the mmWave spectrum requires an alignment between the signal beam of the transmitter and receiver, achieved via beam training protocols. Nevertheless, beam training is vulnerable to jamming attacks, where the attacker intends to send jamming signals over different spatial directions to confuse legitimate nodes. This paper focuses on defending against this attack in smart factories where a moving Automated Guided Vehicle (AGV) communicates with a base station via a mmWave carrier. We introduce a defensive strategy to cope with jamming attacks, including two stages: jamming detection and jamming mitigation. Developed based on autoencoders, both algorithms can learn the characteristics/features of the received signals at the AGV. They can be employed consecutively before performing the downlink data transmission. In particular, once a jamming attack is identified, the jamming mitigation can be utilized to retrieve the corrupted received signal strength vector, allowing a better decision during the beam training operation. In addition, the proposed algorithm is straightforward and fully compliant with the existing beam training protocols in 5G New Radio. The numerical results show that not only the proposed defensive strategy can capture more than 80% of attack events, but it also improves the average signal-to-interference-plus-noise-ratio significantly, i.e., up to 15 dB.  © 2005-2012 IEEE.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85153401857&doi=10.1109%2fTIFS.2023.3265341&partnerID=40&md5=b4f9aee59bcfc11d414ac495237c1ca8,IEEE Transactions on Information Forensics and Security,2023
Collaborative Authentication for 6G Networks: An Edge Intelligence Based Autonomous Approach,"The conventional device authentication of wireless networks usually relies on a security server and centralized process, leading to long latency and risk of single-point of failure. While these challenges might be mitigated by collaborative authentication schemes, their performance remains limited by the rigidity of data collection and aggregated result. They also tend to ignore attacker localization in the collaborative authentication process. To overcome these challenges, a novel collaborative authentication scheme is proposed, where multiple edge devices act as cooperative peers to assist the service provider in distributively authenticating its users by estimating their received signal strength indicator (RSSI) and mobility trajectory (TRA). More explicitly, a distributed learning-based collaborative authentication algorithm is conceived, where the cooperative peers update their authentication models locally, thus the network congestion and response time remain low. Moreover, a situation-aware secure group update algorithm is proposed for autonomously refreshing the set of cooperative peers in the dynamic environment. We also develop an algorithm for localizing a malicious user by the cooperative peers once it is identified. The simulation results demonstrate that the proposed scheme is eminently suitable for both indoor and outdoor communication scenarios, and outperforms some existing benchmark schemes.  © 2005-2012 IEEE.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85153341686&doi=10.1109%2fTIFS.2023.3263636&partnerID=40&md5=cae30c5ad7a097167628ddd303bf3817,IEEE Transactions on Information Forensics and Security,2023
Gaussian Radar Transformer for Semantic Segmentation in Noisy Radar Data,"Scene understanding is crucial for autonomous robots in dynamic environments for making future state predictions, avoiding collisions, and path planning. Camera and LiDAR perception made tremendous progress in recent years, but face limitations under adverse weather conditions. To leverage the full potential of multi-modal sensor suites, radar sensors are essential for safety critical tasks and are already installed in most new vehicles today. In this letter, we address the problem of semantic segmentation of moving objects in radar point clouds to enhance the perception of the environment with another sensor modality. Instead of aggregating multiple scans to densify the point clouds, we propose a novel approach based on the self-attention mechanism to accurately perform sparse, single-scan segmentation. Our approach, called Gaussian Radar Transformer, includes the newly introduced Gaussian transformer layer, which replaces the softmax normalization by a Gaussian function to decouple the contribution of individual points. To tackle the challenge of the transformer to capture long-range dependencies, we propose our attentive up- and downsampling modules to enlarge the receptive field and capture strong spatial relations. We compare our approach to other state-of-the-art methods on the RadarScenes data set and show superior segmentation quality in diverse environments, even without exploiting temporal information. © 2016 IEEE.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85144039435&doi=10.1109%2fLRA.2022.3226030&partnerID=40&md5=044b3f19041b15be70838605635d3a59,IEEE Robotics and Automation Letters,2023
High actuation capability and smooth-deformation piezo morphing wing based on multi-layer parallel pre-compressed MFC bimorph,"A single macro-fiber composite (MFC) unimorph or bimorph wing can only be applied to micro aerial vehicles (MAV) at speeds lower than 20 m/s owing to its relatively small output work. In this study, a high-actuation MFC pre-compressed bimorph actuator (MFC-PBA) multilayer parallel morphing wing is proposed for application in high-speed miniature unmanned aerial vehicles (mini-UAVs). The morphing wing adopts the proposed ribs with an arc groove and three parallel layers of MFC-PBAs to improve the output work and guarantee smooth morphing wing surface. The large deformation finite element (FE) models of a single MFC-PBA and its multilayer parallel morphing wing are established to evaluate the output deformation and output force. Subsequently, a prototype of the morphing wing is fabricated, and the actuation capabilities of the single MFC-PBAs and morphing wing are tested. The experimental and FE simulation results satisfactorily agree. The results show that at the peak driving voltage, with axial compression forces of 18 and 27 N applied to the side and middle MFC-PBAs, respectively, the deflection angle of the morphing wing reaches ±12°, which is twice that of the morphing wing without compression; and its blocking force is maintained at 1.682 N; thus, its output work has doubled. The multiphysics model of the proposed morphing wing under airflow is established to evaluate the deformation capability. The results show that the present morphing wing achieves a deflection of 5.04° on the side of the incoming flow direction, and a unit lift of 249.1 N/m at an air speed of 40 m/s and angle of attack of 15°. Consequently, the proposed morphing wing exhibits a high deformation capability. We expect the proposed morphing wing will be used for the flight control of mini-UAVs at higher speeds and larger sizes. © 2022 Elsevier Masson SAS",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85145653998&doi=10.1016%2fj.ast.2022.108083&partnerID=40&md5=08b1c860a33b2826af81b3ec4d4b0381,Aerospace Science and Technology,2023
Driver Profile and Driving Pattern Recognition for Road Safety Assessment: Main Challenges and Future Directions,"This study reviews the Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning approaches developed thus far for driver profile and driving pattern recognition, representing a set of macroscopic and microscopic behaviors respectively, to enhance the understanding of human factors in road safety, and therefore reduce the number of crashes. It provides a definition of the two scientific fields in terms of safety, and identifies the most efficient approaches used regarding methodology, data collection and driving metrics. Results show that K-means and Neural Networks are the most commonly used methodologies for driver profile identification, and Dynamic Time Warping for driving pattern detection. Most studies discovered driver profiles related to aggressiveness, considering mainly speed and acceleration as driving metrics. Based on the gaps and challenges identified, this paper provides a new framework for combining microscopic and macroscopic driving behavior analysis, instead of examining them separately as is the state-of-theart. Such combined results can potentially improve the development of traffic risk models, which could be exploited in applications that monitor drivers in real-time and provide feedback. These models will represent human behavior more accurately, which can eventually lead to the recognition of 'optimal' human driving patterns that Automated Vehicles (AV) could 'mimic' to become safer.  © 2020 IEEE.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85147278056&doi=10.1109%2fOJITS.2023.3237177&partnerID=40&md5=46f0deec077845bc02e84088d3301166,IEEE Open Journal of Intelligent Transportation Systems,2023
A Mathematical Modeling of Stuxnet-Style Autonomous Vehicle Malware,"Autonomous vehicles (AVs) have the potential to provide new paradigms to enhance the safety, mobility, and environmental sustainability of surface transportation. However, as vehicles become more computerized and internally interconnected by electronic control systems, their vulnerability to cyber-attacks is a fast-growing concern and a national priority. Evidence from the Internet virus suggests that AVs will have critical challenges posed by epidemic-style malware like Stuxnet. This self-propagating malware is a fast and powerful way of disrupting the AV system and transportation infrastructure. This study presents a mathematical model for Stuxnet-style malware's temporal and spatial spread. Taking cues from the field of epidemiology and ecology, the malware will be described as an infectious epidemic to capture the dynamics of temporal and spatial propagation behavior. This study is the first attempt to analyze the spread of Stuxnet-style malware on AVs. The future uses of such a model for the temporal-geographic spread of AVs-based infectious malware are discussed.  © 2000-2011 IEEE.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85146255088&doi=10.1109%2fTITS.2022.3213771&partnerID=40&md5=f62c277d14aeda438b5ee41ea361f263,IEEE Transactions on Intelligent Transportation Systems,2023
Blockchain-Enabled Authenticated Key Agreement Scheme for Mobile Vehicles-Assisted Precision Agricultural IoT Networks,"Precision farming has a positive potential in the agricultural industry regarding water conservation, increased productivity, better development of rural areas, and increased income. Blockchain technology is a better alternative for storing and sharing farm data as it is reliable, transparent, immutable, and decentralized. Remote monitoring of an agricultural field requires security systems to ensure that any sensitive information is exchanged only among authenticated entities in the network. To this end, we design an efficient blockchain-enabled authenticated key agreement scheme for mobile vehicles-assisted precision agricultural Internet of Things (IoT) networks called AgroMobiBlock. The limited existing work on authentication in agricultural networks shows passive usage of blockchains with very high costs. AgroMobiBlock proposes a novel idea using the elliptic curve operations on an active hybrid blockchain over mobile farming vehicles with low computation and communication costs. Formal and informal security analysis along with the formal security verification using the Automated Validation of Internet Security Protocols and Applications (AVISPA) software tool have shown the robustness of AgroMobiBlock against man-in-the-middle, impersonation, replay, physical capture, and ephemeral secret leakage attacks among other potential attacks. The blockchain-based simulation on large-scale nodes shows the computational time for an increase in the network and block sizes. Moreover, the real-time testbed experiments have been performed to show the practical usefulness of the proposed scheme.  © 2005-2012 IEEE.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85146240255&doi=10.1109%2fTIFS.2022.3231121&partnerID=40&md5=37609eaced71beff61a20907c59cd6a4,IEEE Transactions on Information Forensics and Security,2023
Long-Term Localization Using Semantic Cues in Floor Plan Maps,"Lifelong localization in a given map is an essential capability for autonomous service robots. In this letter, we consider the task of long-term localization in a changing indoor environment given sparse CAD floor plans. The commonly used pre-built maps from the robot sensors may increase the cost and time of deployment. Furthermore, their detailed nature requires that they are updated when significant changes occur. We address the difficulty of localization when the correspondence between the map and the observations is low due to the sparsity of the CAD map and the changing environment. To overcome both challenges, we propose to exploit semantic cues that are commonly present in human-oriented spaces. These semantic cues can be detected using RGB cameras by utilizing object detection, and are matched against an easy-to-update, abstract semantic map. The semantic information is integrated into a Monte Carlo localization framework using a particle filter that operates on 2D LiDAR scans and camera data. We provide a long-term localization solution and a semantic map format, for environments that undergo changes to their interior structure and detailed geometric maps are not available. We evaluate our localization framework on multiple challenging indoor scenarios in an office environment, taken weeks apart. The experiments suggest that our approach is robust to structural changes and can run on an onboard computer. We released the open source implementation of our approach written in C++ together with a ROS wrapper. © 2016 IEEE.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85144028570&doi=10.1109%2fLRA.2022.3223556&partnerID=40&md5=e78665f4637080f9c194cb0377ee2c8a,IEEE Robotics and Automation Letters,2023
Query-Efficient Adversarial Attack With Low Perturbation Against End-to-End Speech Recognition Systems,"With the widespread use of automated speech recognition (ASR) systems in modern consumer devices, attack against ASR systems have become an attractive topic in recent years. Although related white-box attack methods have achieved remarkable success in fooling neural networks, they rely heavily on obtaining full access to the details of the target models. Due to the lack of prior knowledge of the victim model and the inefficiency in utilizing query results, most of the existing black-box attack methods for ASR systems are query-intensive. In this paper, we propose a new black-box attack called the Monte Carlo gradient sign attack (MGSA) to generate adversarial audio samples with substantially fewer queries. It updates an original sample based on the elements obtained by a Monte Carlo tree search. We attribute its high query efficiency to the effective utilization of the dominant gradient phenomenon, which refers to the fact that only a few elements of each origin sample have significant effect on the output of ASR systems. Extensive experiments are performed to evaluate the efficiency of MGSA and the stealthiness of the generated adversarial examples on the DeepSpeech system. The experimental results show that MGSA achieves 98% and 99% attack success rates on the LibriSpeech and Mozilla Common Voice datasets, respectively. Compared with the state-of-the-art methods, the average number of queries is reduced by 27% and the signal-to-noise ratio is increased by 31%.  © 2005-2012 IEEE.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85142860543&doi=10.1109%2fTIFS.2022.3222963&partnerID=40&md5=8c9d576cc3c4bc4382366a709e81b1cb,IEEE Transactions on Information Forensics and Security,2023
Jamming and Eavesdropping Defense Scheme Based on Deep Reinforcement Learning in Autonomous Vehicle Networks,"As a legacy from conventional wireless services, illegal eavesdropping is regarded as one of the critical security challenges in Connected and Autonomous Vehicles (CAVs) network. Our work considers the use of Distributed Kalman Filtering (DKF) and Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) techniques to improve anti-eavesdropping communication capacity and mitigate jamming interference. Aiming to improve the security performance against smart eavesdropper and jammer, we first develop a DKF algorithm that is capable of tracking the attacker more accurately by sharing state estimates among adjacent nodes. Then, a design problem for controlling transmission power and selecting communication channel is established while ensuring communication quality requirements of the authorized vehicular user. Since the eavesdropping and jamming model is uncertain and dynamic, a hierarchical Deep Q-Network (DQN)-based architecture is developed to design the anti-eavesdropping power control and possibly channel selection policy. Specifically, the optimal power control scheme without prior information of the eavesdropping behavior can be quickly achieved first. Based on the system secrecy rate assessment, the channel selection process is then performed when necessary. Simulation results confirm that our jamming and eavesdropping defense technique enhances the secrecy rate as well as achievable communication rate compared with currently available techniques.  © 2005-2012 IEEE.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85147274363&doi=10.1109%2fTIFS.2023.3236788&partnerID=40&md5=0743607d94d662ed1af08dcbc7634b24,IEEE Transactions on Information Forensics and Security,2023
Hydro-optic interaction study on submerged unmanned underwater vehicles regarding to Snell's window,"The underwater creatures have always desired to collect information about what is in beyond, for instance, the fishes that hunt birds with precise calculations. Possessing a subsurface device capable of imaging the outside area of water without any distortion can be notified of modern demand. To be acquainted with this phenomenon, a series of submerged hydrofoils with various geometrical properties are mentioned in different submerged distance and incidence angles to recognize the recondite limits upon its aberrated eyesight. The behavioral changes of the wave's surface have been numerically discussed in detail by ray length. The primary outcomes reveal that Snell's window varies under different conditions. In brief, the emitted ray undergoes more severe distortions when the hydrofoil is positioned near the water's surface. However, interestingly enough, other parameters such as hydrofoil's geometry, the angle of attack, and the flow's velocity affect the wave's shape, and that wave's geometry sets different distortions patterns in different areas that the camera spots. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85145561506&doi=10.1016%2fj.oceaneng.2022.113224&partnerID=40&md5=61939d8bfaf55bdc0b41fa4d28209bd7,Ocean Engineering,2023
Insufficiency-Driven DNN Error Detection in the Context of SOTIF on Traffic Sign Recognition Use Case,"Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) are used in various domains and industry fields with great success due to their ability to learn complex tasks from high-dimensional data. However, the data-driven approach within deep learning results in various DNN-specific insufficiencies (e.g., robustness limitations, overconfidence, lack of interpretability), which makes the usage in safety-critical applications, like automated driving, challenging. An important safety strategy to address these limitations is the detection of DNN errors (e.g., false positives) during runtime. In this work, we present a general error detection approach for DNNs, which combines diverse monitoring methods to address different safety-related DNN insufficiencies simultaneously. To ensure consistency with the automotive safety domain, we take into account established concepts of the automotive safety standard ISO 21448 (SOTIF). We apply our error detection method on the safety-related use case of traffic sign recognition by using self-created 3D driving scenarios. In doing so, we consider different types of DNN errors related to in distribution, out of distribution, and adversarial data. We demonstrate that our approach is able to handle all these error types. Furthermore, we show the performance benefit of our method compared to a baseline DNN and to state of the art DNN monitoring methods.  © 2020 IEEE.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85147283603&doi=10.1109%2fOJITS.2023.3236531&partnerID=40&md5=f4dbbf14920ef170c9edb714159e8c00,IEEE Open Journal of Intelligent Transportation Systems,2023
Three-Dimensional Trajectory Design for Unmanned Aerial Vehicle-Based Secure and Energy-Efficient Data Collection,"Fixed-wing unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) provide a practical means for data collection in many Internet-of-Things (IoT) applications. Secrecy and energy efficiency are crucial to the data collection, but have never been well addressed in the lack of appropriate propulsion energy models for three-dimensional (3D) flights of fixed-wing UAVs. This paper delivers a new approach to the joint optimization of the 3D flight trajectory and data collection schedule of a fixed-wing UAV for secure and energy-efficient data collection under an eavesdropping attack. A critical aspect is that we derive a new propulsion energy model for fixed-wing UAVs flying 3D trajectories. By using equivalent transformation, difference-of-convex techniques, and successive convex approximation, we convexify the model and demonstrate its viability to the design of energy-efficient 3D trajectories. Another key aspect is that we further optimize the trajectory and schedule of the UAV for secure and energy-efficient collection of secret data from sensor nodes on the ground. This is non-trivial due to the convexification of the non-smooth secrecy constraints in addition to the new 3D propulsion energy model. Simulations validate the new model and demonstrate considerable energy saving of 3D trajectories, compared to two-dimensional (2D) trajectories optimized based on the state-of-the-art 2D propulsion energy model.  © 1967-2012 IEEE.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85137564897&doi=10.1109%2fTVT.2022.3203714&partnerID=40&md5=c8e96c65e916278335c9963dd79e03ba,IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology,2023
A Data-Driven Cyber-Physical System Using Deep-Learning Convolutional Neural Networks: Study on False-Data Injection Attacks in an Unmanned Ground Vehicle Under Fault-Tolerant Conditions,"Leveraging the benefits of deep-learning convolutional neural networks, we introduce a new data-driven cyber-physical system specifically designed to address the vulnerability of middleware software, namely, Robot Operating System (ROS), widely implemented in robotics in both civilian and military domains. As for our research platform, we employ the GVR-BOT unmanned ground vehicle, which is a replicate of the U.S. Army ground robot. We focus our study on the ability of the ground robot to operate under fault-tolerant conditions, making it challenging from the standpoint of cybersecurity to differentiate between legitimate and malicious operations. The GVR-BOT ground vehicle belongs to a class of differential drive ground robots and employs ROS in its onboard computer to interact with users. To facilitate deep learning, we develop a large database of images based on the network-traffic data of ROS, describing the dynamics of the GVR-BOT ground robot under legitimate and malicious operations. We use our image database to train and validate the performance of our deep-learning CNN system. Given a set of RGB/grayscale images describing the normalized time-series data representing the dynamics of the GVR-BOT ground robot, the objective of our proposed cybersecurity algorithm is to safeguard the legitimate operation of the ground robot under fault-tolerant conditions, such that any attempts to compromise its performance (e.g., malicious attacks) can be prevented within the minimum detection time. Our research indicates a promising result as our system is capable of detecting malicious attacks with high accuracy while recognizing its legitimate operations with reasonably small false-positive rates.  © 2013 IEEE.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85133778456&doi=10.1109%2fTSMC.2022.3170071&partnerID=40&md5=2573c7a794359067c2e791ee6f7ceecb,"IEEE Transactions on Systems, Man, and Cybernetics: Systems",2023
Fault-Tolerant Cooperative Driving at Signal-Free Intersections,"Cooperative driving shows great potential to improve traffic safety and efficiency and has been well discussed in recent years. However, most existing studies focus on ideal traffic environments and ignore potential vehicle failures in traffic systems, which pose significant threats to traffic safety. Therefore, the fault-tolerant capacity of the existing cooperative driving strategies is questionable. To fill this research gap, this paper proposes a fault-tolerant cooperative driving strategy for signal-free intersections by modeling potential vehicle failure types, aiming to keep a good balance between traffic safety and efficiency. Notably, a rule-based fault-tolerant model is constructed to mitigate the threat of potential vehicle failures to traffic safety and efficiency, and to effectively recover the cooperative driving system after vehicle failures occur. Theoretical analysis and simulation results jointly demonstrate the promising performance of the proposed model in achieving fault tolerance and improving traffic efficiency. © 2016 IEEE.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85126516228&doi=10.1109%2fTIV.2022.3159088&partnerID=40&md5=f02f2c263ba6ba718ea8127e840b216e,IEEE Transactions on Intelligent Vehicles,2023
DeepCar 5.0: Vehicle Make and Model Recognition Under Challenging Conditions,"Inspired by multi-agent systems (MASs) and ensemble models, a novel method of vehicle make and model recognition (VMMR) based on a vehicle's front-view images is presented in this paper. By exploiting the attention mechanism in this work, it is demonstrated that most of the features used for classifying a vehicle are extracted from its headlight, grill, scoop, and bumper sections. These areas are designated as the regions of interest (ROIs) in our approach. Contrary to the other methods in which a whole ROI is fed to a deep convolutional neural network, in this scheme, different ROIs are extracted from each image, and then a preprocessing block and a distinctive network are designed for each ROI, which is considered as a single agent. Each agent is then trained separately, and a vehicle's type is determined with the collaboration of these agents and based on the blackboard classification system. Also, a new dataset (DeepCar 5.0) is compiled by using the data from the top 50 automakers. This dataset contains 40,185 images of the front views and the front three-quarters of vehicles in 480 different classes, and all the parts of dataset are labeled manually. The proposed technique is able to achieve the accuracies of 92.14 and 96.72% in the automated and the manual scenarios, respectively; and contrary to the current methods, it can perform flawless classification even when just a portion of a vehicle's front view image is available for processing.  © 2000-2011 IEEE.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85141499342&doi=10.1109%2fTITS.2022.3212921&partnerID=40&md5=79bf8f5f7f8b72bb8a989d78e985ffc2,IEEE Transactions on Intelligent Transportation Systems,2023
Resilient Control for Multiagent Systems with a Sampled-Data Model Against DoS Attacks,"To reduce the computational burden and resist the denial-of-service (DoS) attacks, a resilient distributed sampled-data control scheme is proposed for multiagent systems. The agent states are sampled periodically by the sensors. DoS attacks disrupt the data communication from transmitters to controllers randomly or periodically with a limited duration time. Information on DoS attacks can be obtained by introducing novel logic processors embedded in corresponding controllers. Next, the problem of resilient control can be converted into one concerned with the upper and lower bound of the sampling interval of an aperiodic sampled-data control system. Some sufficient criteria for developing resilient distributed controllers are derived using the novel looped Lyapunov functional approach and the free-matrix-based inequality method. Finally, two illustrative examples, unmanned aerial vehicles and the two-mass-spring systems, are provided to demonstrate the efficiency of the proposed resilient distributed sampled-data control protocols against the DoS attacks. © 2005-2012 IEEE.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85128270426&doi=10.1109%2fTII.2022.3165687&partnerID=40&md5=bd102e2e4cdedd4e2631f36c7685d9d1,IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics,2023
Deep Active Learning Intrusion Detection and Load Balancing in Software-Defined Vehicular Networks,"Software-defined vehicular networks (SDVN) can help analyze and reconfigure networks. Massive data generation in autonomous vehicles can lead to issues in network configuration, routing, network characteristics, and system load factors. Load balancing in vehicle sensors helps reduce delays and improve resource utilization. In this paper, we propose a load balancing algorithm to map sensor data, vehicles and data centers performing tasks. A dynamic convergence method is proposed to help identify vehicle system load factors and compare their termination criteria. We also propose a packet-level intrusion detection model. After all load balancing, the model can track the attack on the network. The proposed model further combines the entropy-based active learning and the attention-based model to efficiently identify the attacks. Experiments are then conducted on the standard KDD data to validate the developed models with and without an attention-based active learning mechanism. Our experimental results show that the load balancing mechanism is able to achieve more performance gains than previous techniques. Moreover, the results show that the developed model can improve the decision boundary by using a pooling strategy and an entropy uncertainty measure.  © 2000-2011 IEEE.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85129409991&doi=10.1109%2fTITS.2022.3166864&partnerID=40&md5=ac6a7c4ed8c939adc7bd1366710d8835,IEEE Transactions on Intelligent Transportation Systems,2023
Robust Lane Change Decision Making for Autonomous Vehicles: An Observation Adversarial Reinforcement Learning Approach,"Reinforcementlearning holds the promise of allowing autonomous vehicles to learn complex decision making behaviors through interacting with other traffic participants. However, many real-world driving tasks involve unpredictable perception errors or measurement noises which may mislead an autonomous vehicle into making unsafe decisions, even cause catastrophic failures. In light of these risks, to ensure safety under perception uncertainty, autonomous vehicles are required to be able to cope with the worst case observation perturbations. Therefore, this paper proposes a novel observation adversarial reinforcement learning approach for robust lane change decision making of autonomous vehicles. A constrained observation-robust Markov decision process is presented to model lane change decision making behaviors of autonomous vehicles under policy constraints and observation uncertainties. Meanwhile, a black-box attack technique based on Bayesian optimization is implemented to approximate the optimal adversarial observation perturbations efficiently. Furthermore, a constrained observation-robust actor-critic algorithm is advanced to optimize autonomous driving lane change policies while keeping the variations of the policies attacked by the optimal adversarial observation perturbations within bounds. Finally, the robust lane change decision making approach is evaluated in three stochastic mixed traffic flows based on different densities. The results demonstrate that the proposed method can not only enhance the performance of an autonomous vehicle but also improve the robustness of lane change policies against adversarial observation perturbations.  © 2016 IEEE.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85127767057&doi=10.1109%2fTIV.2022.3165178&partnerID=40&md5=4140c2d14ae52592e17b40b63f8fcca0,IEEE Transactions on Intelligent Vehicles,2023
AoI Optimization in the UAV-Aided Traffic Monitoring Network Under Attack: A Stackelberg Game Viewpoint,"Intelligent Vehicle Systems (IVSs) devote to integrating the data sensing, processing, and transmission in the Vehicle to Everything (V2X) scenarios, where the Unnamed Aircraft Vehicle (UAV)-aided traffic monitoring network is one of the most significant applications. Moreover, since the central premise to support the IVS is timely and effectively sensing data processing, Age of Information (AoI) can precisely reflect the timeliness and effectiveness of the communication process in the UAV-aided traffic monitoring network. However, recent researches pay little attention to AoI minimization issue, especially when the malicious attacker attempts to deteriorate the network performance. The accurately modelling of the adversarial relationship between legitimate UAVs and attacker is not fully investigated. To make up this research gap, we start from the Stackelberg game viewpoint to investigate the AoI optimization problem in the UAV-aided traffic monitoring network under attack. Firstly, the system model and three-layer Stackelberg game-based optimization goal are established. Secondly, based on the Backward Induction (BI) analysis, the follower's data sensing rate, transmission power, and the leader's attacking power are determined by the Lagrange duality optimization technology successively. Moreover, the sub-gradient update-based optimization technology is used to achieve the Stackelberg Equilibrium (SE). Finally, simulations are performed under various parameters.

End-to-End Autonomous Driving With Semantic Depth Cloud Mapping and Multi-Agent,"Focusing on the task of point-to-point navigation for an autonomous driving vehicle, we propose a novel deep learning model trained with end-to-end and multi-task learning manners to perform both perception and control tasks simultaneously. The model is used to drive the ego vehicle safely by following a sequence of routes defined by the global planner. The perception part of the model is used to encode high-dimensional observation data provided by an RGBD camera while performing semantic segmentation, semantic depth cloud (SDC) mapping, and traffic light state and stop sign prediction. Then, the control part decodes the encoded features along with additional information provided by GPS and speedometer to predict waypoints that come with a latent feature space. Furthermore, two agents are employed to process these outputs and make a control policy that determines the level of steering, throttle, and brake as the final action. The model is evaluated on CARLA simulator with various scenarios made of normal-adversarial situations and different weathers to mimic real-world conditions. In addition, we do a comparative study with some recent models to justify the performance in multiple aspects of driving. Moreover, we also conduct an ablation study on SDC mapping and multi-agent to understand their roles and behavior. As a result, our model achieves the highest driving score even with fewer parameters and computation load.

ADS-Lead: Lifelong Anomaly Detection in Autonomous Driving Systems,"Autonomous Vehicles (AVs) are closely connected in the Cooperative Intelligent Transportation System (C-ITS). They are equipped with various sensors and controlled by Autonomous Driving Systems (ADSs) to provide high-level autonomy. The vehicles exchange different types of real-time data with each other, which can help reduce traffic accidents and congestion, and improve the efficiency of transportation systems. However, when interacting with the environment, AVs suffer from a broad attack surface, and the sensory data are susceptible to anomalies caused by faults, sensor malfunctions, or attacks, which may jeopardize traffic safety and result in serious accidents. In this paper, we propose ADS-Lead, an efficient collaborative anomaly detection methodology to protect the lane-following mechanism of ADSs. ADS-Lead is equipped with a novel transformer-based one-class classification model to identify time series anomalies (GPS spoofing threat) and adversarial image examples (traffic sign and lane recognition attacks). Besides, AVs inside the C-ITS form a cognitive network, enabling us to apply the federated learning technology to our anomaly detection method, where the vehicles in the C-ITS jointly update the detection model with higher model generalization and data privacy.

Joint Multi-Domain Resource Allocation and Trajectory Optimization in UAV-Assisted Maritime IoT Networks,"The integration of Maritime Internet of Things (M-IoT) technology and unmanned aerial/surface vehicles (UAVs/USVs) has been emerging as a promising navigational information technique in intelligent ocean systems. In this article, we consider the UAV-assisted M-IoT network where USVs offload computation-intensive maritime tasks via non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) to the UAV equipped with the mobile-edge computing (MEC) server subject to the UAV mobility. To improve the energy efficiency of offloading transmission and workload computation, we focus on minimizing the total energy consumption by jointly optimizing the USVs' offloaded workload, transmit power, computation resource allocation, as well as the UAV trajectory subject to the USVs' latency requirements. Despite the nature of mixed discrete and non-convex programming of the formulated problem, we exploit the vertical decomposition and propose a two-layered algorithm for solving it efficiently. Specifically, the top-layered algorithm is proposed to solve the problem of optimizing the UAV trajectory based on the idea of deep reinforcement learning (DRL), and the underlying algorithm is proposed to optimize the underlying multidomain resource allocation problem based on the idea of the Lagrangian multiplier method. Numerical results are provided to validate the effectiveness of our proposed algorithms as well as the performance advantage of NOMA-enabled computation offloading in terms of overall energy consumption.  © 2014 IEEE.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85137587517&doi=10.1109%2fJIOT.2022.3201017&partnerID=40&md5=9e0bbdc57688e4c745e5db9404b06870,IEEE Internet of Things Journal,2023
CGAN-Based Collaborative Intrusion Detection for UAV Networks: A Blockchain-Empowered Distributed Federated Learning Approach,"Numerous resource-constrained Internet of Things (IoT) devices make the edge IoT consisting of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) vulnerable to network intrusion. Therefore, it is critical to design an effective intrusion detection system (IDS). However, the differences in local data sets among UAVs show small samples and uneven distribution, further reducing the detection accuracy of network intrusion. This article proposes a conditional generative adversarial net (CGAN)-based collaborative intrusion detection algorithm with blockchain-empowered distributed federated learning to solve the above problems. This study introduces long short-term memory (LSTM) into the CGAN training to improve the effect of generative networks. Based on the feature extraction ability of LSTM networks, the generated data with CGAN are used as augmented data and applied in the detection and classification of intrusion data. Distributed federated learning with differential privacy ensures data security and privacy and allows collaborative training of CGAN models using multiple distributed data sets. Blockchain stores and shares the training models to ensure security when the global model's aggregation and updating. The proposed method has good generalization ability, which can greatly improve the detection of intrusion data.  © 2014 IEEE.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85136685290&doi=10.1109%2fJIOT.2022.3200121&partnerID=40&md5=213abaf5a6e42ebdebd6574175fdeae2,IEEE Internet of Things Journal,2023
MTANet: Multitask-Aware Network with Hierarchical Multimodal Fusion for RGB-T Urban Scene Understanding,"Understanding urban scenes is a fundamental ability requirement for assisted driving and autonomous vehicles. Most of the available urban scene understanding methods use red-green-blue (RGB) images; however, their segmentation performances are prone to degradation under adverse lighting conditions. Recently, many effective artificial neural networks have been presented for urban scene understanding and have shown that incorporating RGB and thermal (RGB-T) images can improve segmentation accuracy even under unsatisfactory lighting conditions. However, the potential of multimodal feature fusion has not been fully exploited because operations such as simply concatenating the RGB and thermal features or averaging their maps have been adopted. To improve the fusion of multimodal features and the segmentation accuracy, we propose a multitask-aware network (MTANet) with hierarchical multimodal fusion (multiscale fusion strategy) for RGB-T urban scene understanding. We developed a hierarchical multimodal fusion module to enhance feature fusion and built a high-level semantic module to extract semantic information for merging with coarse features at various abstraction levels. Using the multilevel fusion module, we exploited low-, mid-, and high-level fusion to improve segmentation accuracy. The multitask module uses boundary, binary, and semantic supervision to optimize the MTANet parameters. Extensive experiments were performed on two benchmark RGB-T datasets to verify the improved performance of the proposed MTANet compared with state-of-the-art methods.1  © 2016 IEEE.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85127796639&doi=10.1109%2fTIV.2022.3164899&partnerID=40&md5=ec1c0f0dfe1fb2472476a09d58f8474a,IEEE Transactions on Intelligent Vehicles,2023
"Data Poisoning Attacks in Internet-of-Vehicle Networks: Taxonomy, State-of-The-Art, and Future Directions","With the unprecedented development of deep learning, autonomous vehicles (AVs) have achieved tremendous progress nowadays. However, AV supported by DNN models is vulnerable to data poisoning attacks, hindering the large-scale application of autonomous driving. For example, by injecting carefully designed poisons into the training dataset of the DNN model in the traffic sign recognition system, the attacker can mislead the system to make targeted misclassification or cause a reduction in model classification accuracy. In this article, we conduct a thorough investigation of the state-of-the-art data poisoning attacks and defenses against AVs. According to whether the attacker needs to manipulate the data labeling process, we divide the state-of-the-art attack approaches into two categories, i.e., dirty-label attacks and clean-label attacks. We also differentiate the existing defense methods into two categories based on whether to modify the training data or the models, i.e., data-based defenses and model-based defenses. In addition to a detailed review of attacks and defenses in each category, we also give a qualitative comparison of the existing attacks and defenses. Besides, we provide a quantitative comparison of the existing attack and defense methods through experiments. Last but not least, we pinpoint several future directions for data poisoning attacks and defenses in AVs, providing possible ways for further research.  © 2005-2012 IEEE.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85136899332&doi=10.1109%2fTII.2022.3198481&partnerID=40&md5=e706702ef8b90de95f8075ff310decae,IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics,2023
Convex Vision-Based Negative Obstacle Detection Framework for Autonomous Vehicles,"This study investigates the convex optimization frameworks for accurate and fast negative obstacle detection as well as depth estimations that are vital for real-time, superior autonomous vehicle operations. A convex framework is proposed in conjunction with a unique stereo perception approach to manage the complex nature of such invisible obstacles. The proposed stereo configuration incorporates an alignment that displaces the cameras along a vertical baseline to extract useful information pertaining to negative obstacle features for various illustrative terrain settings. The convex framework exploits these properties to evaluate depth jumps in the disparity space image and perform geometrical analysis of potential occlusion regions. The corresponding convex formulations are based on linear matrix inequalities to detect sudden disparity, angle profile, and intensity variations for potential negative obstacles and to estimate the internal depth of the detected obstacles. Experimental results demonstrate that consecutive processes can be structured in a convex framework to efficiently identify negative obstacle attributes at a range of distances for texture varying environments, providing a vital extension to real-time vehicular system implementations with superior detection rates. © 2016 IEEE.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85124221857&doi=10.1109%2fTIV.2022.3146877&partnerID=40&md5=3c1cf5b60c5ca511d775b45e8abccea3,IEEE Transactions on Intelligent Vehicles,2023
Fixed-Time Resilient Edge-Triggered Estimation and Control of Surface Vehicles for Cooperative Target Tracking Under Attacks,"This paper is concerned with the cooperative target tracking of under-actuated unmanned surface vehicles (USVs) with event-triggered communications subject to denial-of-service (DoS) attacks. The target position information can be sensed by a fraction of follower USVs only. A fixed-time resilient cooperative edge-triggered estimation and control architecture is presented for achieving cooperative target tracking under DoS attacks. Specifically, a distributed edge-triggered fixed-time extended state observer (ESO) is designed to recover the position and velocity of the target with a prescribed time regardless of the unreliable communication network subject to DoS attacks. Moreover, the communication burden of the network is reduced by the proposed edge-triggered mechanism. In the control law design, a fixed-time ESO is designed for estimating the model uncertainties and external disturbances in an earth-fixed reference frame. Then, a fixed-time target tracking control law is proposed for each follower USV based on the fixed-time ESO. It is proven that the error signals in the closed-loop control system of USVs are convergent to the origin in a fixed time. An example is provided to substantiate the effectiveness of the proposed fixed-time resilient cooperative edge-triggered estimation and control architecture for USVs.  © 2016 IEEE.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85132629871&doi=10.1109%2fTIV.2022.3184076&partnerID=40&md5=57cdcaeaf659ab312bc88336a10a4a9c,IEEE Transactions on Intelligent Vehicles,2023
Boosting UAV Tracking with Voxel-Based Trajectory-Aware Pre-Training,"Siamese network-based object tracking has remarkably promoted the automatic capability for highly-maneuvered unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs). However, the leading-edge tracking framework often depends on template matching, making it trapped when facing multiple views of object in consecutive frames. Moreover, the general image-level pretrained backbone can overfit to holistic representations, causing the misalignment to learn object-level properties in UAV tracking. To tackle these issues, this work presents TRTrack, a comprehensive framework to fully exploit the stereoscopic representation for UAV tracking. Specifically, a novel pre-training paradigm method is proposed. Through trajectory-aware reconstruction training (TRT), the capability of the backbone to extract stereoscopic structure feature is strengthened without any parameter increment. Accordingly, an innovative hierarchical self-attention Transformer is proposed to capture the local detail information and global structure knowledge. For optimizing the correlation map, we proposed a novel spatial correlation refinement (SCR) module, which promotes the capability of modeling the long-range spatial dependencies. Comprehensive experiments on three UAV challenging benchmarks demonstrate that the proposed TRTrack achieves superior UAV tracking performance in both precision and efficiency. Quantitative tests in real-world settings fully prove the effectiveness of our work. © 2022 IEEE.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85147302435&doi=10.1109%2fLRA.2023.3236583&partnerID=40&md5=2e32aabe18ee85c404d247f48f223915,IEEE Robotics and Automation Letters,2023
DLTIF: Deep Learning-Driven Cyber Threat Intelligence Modeling and Identification Framework in IoT-Enabled Maritime Transportation Systems,"The recent burgeoning of Internet of Things (IoT) technologies in the maritime industry is successfully digitalizing Maritime Transportation Systems (MTS). In IoT-enabled MTS, the smart maritime objects, infrastructure associated with ship or port communicate wirelessly using an open channel Internet. The intercommunication and incorporation of heterogeneous technologies in IoT-enabled MTS brings opportunities not only for the industries that embrace it, but also for cyber-criminals. Cyber Threat Intelligence (CTI) is an effective security strategy that uses artificial intelligence models to understand cyber-attacks and can protect data of IoT-enabled MTS proficiently. Unsurprisingly, most of the existing CTI-based solutions uses manual analysis to extract relevant threat information, and has low detection and high false alarm rate. Therefore, to tackle aforementioned challenges, an automated framework called DLTIF is developed for modeling cyber threat intelligence and identifying threat types. The proposed DLTIF is based on three schemes: a deep feature extractor (DFE), CTI-driven detection (CTIDD) and CTI-attack type identification (CTIATI). The DFE scheme automatically extracts the hidden patterns of IoT-enabled MTS network and its output is used by CTIDD scheme for threat detection. The CTIATI scheme is designed to identify the exact threat types and to assist security analysts in giving early warning and adopt defensive strategies. The proposed framework has obtained upto 99% accuracy, and outperforms some traditional and recent state-of-the-art approaches. © 2000-2011 IEEE.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85148650746&doi=10.1109%2fTITS.2021.3122368&partnerID=40&md5=0a2c729a352b24875bd7a30b7e8ea3ff,IEEE Transactions on Intelligent Transportation Systems,2023
"Learning Based Longitudinal Vehicle Platooning Threat Detection, Identification and Mitigation","The security of cyber-physical systems, such as vehicle platoons, is critical to ensuring their proper operation and acceptance to society. In platooning, vehicles follow one another according to an agreed-upon control law that determines vehicle separation. We show that a vehicle within a platoon and under the control of a malicious actor could cause collisions or decrease the efficiency of surrounding vehicles. This paper focuses on detecting, identifying, and mitigating so-called destabilizing attacks that could cause vehicle collisions. Our approach is decentralized and requires only local sensor information for each vehicle to identify the vehicle responsible for the attack and then deploy an appropriate mitigating controller that prevents collisions. We use a Deep Learning approach (Convolutional Neural Network) with various data preprocessing techniques to detect and identify the malicious vehicle. Results indicate that even with decent noise levels in range and relative speed data, we achieve accuracy up to 96.3%. Also, once the adversarial vehicle is localized, we derive conditions for controller gains using the Routh Hurwitz criterion to mitigate the attack and ensure the stability of the platoon. Realistic simulator CARLA and MATLAB simulation results validate the effectiveness of our proposed approaches. © 2016 IEEE.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85118547846&doi=10.1109%2fTIV.2021.3122144&partnerID=40&md5=f1ede81d976be0eb8eab7e0ace2cec2f,IEEE Transactions on Intelligent Vehicles,2023
OQFL: An Optimized Quantum-Based Federated Learning Framework for Defending Against Adversarial Attacks in Intelligent Transportation Systems,"Intelligent transportation systems, especially Autonomous Vehicles (AVs), are emerging as a paradigm with the potential to change modern society. However, with this, there is a strong need to ensure the security and privacy of such systems. AV ecosystems depend on machine learning algorithms to autonomously control their operations. Given the amount of personal information AVs collect, coupled with the distributed nature of such ecosystems, there is a movement to employ federated learning algorithms to develop secure decision-making models. Although federated learning is a viable candidate for data privacy, it is vulnerable to adversarial attacks, particularly data poisoning attacks, where malicious vectors would be injected in the training phase. Additionally, hyperparameters play an important role in establishing an efficient federated learning model that can be resilient against adversarial attacks. In this paper, to address these challenges, we propose a novel Optimized Quantum-based Federated Learning (OQFL) framework to automatically adjust the hyperparameters of federated learning using various adversarial attacks in AV settings. This work is innovative in two ways: first, a quantum-behaved particle swarm optimization technique is used to update the hyperparameters of the learning rate, local and global epochs. Second, the proposed technique is utilized within a cyber defense framework to defend against adversarial attacks. The performance of the proposed framework was evaluated using two benchmark datasets: MINST and Fashion-MINST, where they include images that would be extracted from smart cameras of AVs. This framework is shown to be more resilient against various adversarial attacks compared with peer techniques.  © 2000-2011 IEEE.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85121353526&doi=10.1109%2fTITS.2021.3130906&partnerID=40&md5=d21e4b8f198bbf45af432f22c8180364,IEEE Transactions on Intelligent Transportation Systems,2023
Data Offloading in UAV-Assisted Multi-Access Edge Computing Systems Under Resource Uncertainty,"In this paper, a novel data offloading decision-making framework is proposed, where users have the option to partially offload their data to a complex Multi-access Edge Computing (MEC) environment, consisting of both ground and UAV-mounted MEC servers. The problem is treated under the perspective of risk-aware user behavior as captured via prospect-theoretic utility functions, while accounting for the inherent computing environment uncertainties. The UAV-mounted MEC servers act as a common pool of resources with potentially superior but uncertain payoff for the users, while the local computation and ground server alternatives constitute safe and guaranteed options, respectively. The optimal user task offloading to the available computing choices is formulated as a maximization problem of each user's satisfaction, and confronted as a non-cooperative game. The existence and uniqueness of a Pure Nash Equilibrium (PNE) are proven, and convergence to the PNE is shown. Detailed numerical results highlight the convergence of the system to the PNE in few only iterations, while the impact of user behavior heterogeneity is evaluated. The introduced framework's consideration of the user risk-aware characteristics and computing uncertainties, results to a sophisticated exploitation of the system resources, which in turn leads to superior users' experienced performance compared to alternative approaches.  © 2002-2012 IEEE.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85103789187&doi=10.1109%2fTMC.2021.3069911&partnerID=40&md5=47a2072977c60907f7d8e2760e108e86,IEEE Transactions on Mobile Computing,2023
Deep Reinforcement Learning for Aerial Data Collection in Hybrid-Powered NOMA-IoT Networks,"With the help of unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV), remote terminals that out of wireless coverage can be connected to the Internet of Things (IoT) networks. Currently, the IoT relies on a large number of low-cost wireless sensors with limited energy supply to realize ubiquitous monitoring and intelligent control. The hybrid-powered networks composed of wireless-powered communication (WPC) terminal and solar-powered UAV can solve the energy supply problem of the IoT networks, and the nonorthogonal multiple access (NOMA) technique can solve the massive access problem of IoT terminals. Exploiting these benefits, we investigate joint UAV 3-D trajectory design and time allocation for aerial data collection in hybrid-powered NOMA-IoT networks. To maximize the total fair network throughput, we jointly consider energy limitation, Quality of Service (QoS) requirements, and flight conditions. The problem is nonconvex and time-dimension coupled which is intractable to solve by traditional optimization methods. Therefore, we develop a deep reinforcement learning (DRL) algorithm called fair communication is accomplished by trajectory design and time allocation (FC-TDTA), which uses the deep deterministic policy gradient (DDPG) as its basis. Simulation results show that our proposed algorithm performs better than benchmarks in fair throughput maximization. The proposed FC-TDTA algorithm can make the UAV: 1) fly in appropriate direction and speed, so that the UAV can arrive at the charging station before the energy runs out and 2) conduct WPC energy transmission and data collection to achieve fair communication.  © 2014 IEEE.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85139444963&doi=10.1109%2fJIOT.2022.3209980&partnerID=40&md5=7824af60b3e379b204124b7ff51f90da,IEEE Internet of Things Journal,2023
Command filtered-based neuro-adaptive robust finite-time trajectory tracking control of autonomous underwater vehicles under stochastic perturbations,"In this paper, the problem of finite-time trajectory tracking control is studied and addressed for a 6 degree of freedom (DOF) autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV) subjected to unknown dynamic model, stochastic perturbations, external disturbances (matched and mismatched) and saturation input nonlinearities. Based on the backstepping control approach, novel finite-time control inputs are designed and proposed. Artificial neural networks (ANNs) and finite-time adaptation laws are exploited to approximate the nonlinear dynamics of AUV, the stochastic perturbations and the upper bound of external disturbances. To handle the destructive effects of saturation input nonlinearities, finite-time auxiliary system method is utilized. To overcome the explosion of complexity problem of backstepping control strategy, compensator-based finite-time command filter approach is exploited. By utilizing the Lyapunov stability theorem, it is mathematically proven and demonstrated that the suggested nonlinear control inputs are able to guarantee the semi-global finite-time stability in probability (SGFSP) of the closed-loop AUV system.

Siamese Cross-Domain Tracker Design for Seamless Tracking of Targets in RGB and Thermal Videos,"Multimodal (RGB and thermal) applications are swiftly gaining importance in the computer vision community with advancements in self-driving cars, robotics, Internet of Things, and surveillance applications. Both the modalities have complementary performance depending on illumination constraints. Hence, a judicious combination of both modalities will result in robust RGBT systems capable of all-day all-weather applications. Several studies have been proposed in the literature for integrating the multimodal sensor data for object tracking applications.

Adversarial Blur-Deblur Network for Robust UAV Tracking,"Unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) tracking has been widely applied in real-world applications such as surveillance and monitoring. However, the inherent high maneuverability and agility of UAV often lead to motion blur, which can impair the visual appearance of the target object and easily degrade the existing trackers. To overcome this challenge, this work proposes a tracking-oriented adversarial blur-deblur network (ABDNet), composed of a novel deblurrer to recover the visual appearance of the tracked object, and a brand-new blur generator to produce realistic blurry images for adversarial training. More specifically, the deblurrer progressively refines the features through pixel-wise, spatial-wise, and channel-wise stages to achieve excellent deblurring performance. The blur generator adaptively fuses an image sequence with a learnable kernel to create realistic blurry images. During training, ABDNet is plugged into the state-of-the-art real-time trackers and trained with blurring-deblurring loss as well as tracking loss. During inference, the blur generator is removed, while the deblurrer and the tracker can work together for UAV tracking. Extensive experiments in both public datasets and real-world testing have validated the effectiveness of ABDNet. © 2022 IEEE.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85147277335&doi=10.1109%2fLRA.2023.3236584&partnerID=40&md5=4d651a4871a9b242a26ebda7550dc4a5,IEEE Robotics and Automation Letters,2023

Exploiting Linear Structure for Precision Control of Highly Nonlinear Vehicle Dynamics,"Drifting - operating a vehicle at a high sideslip angle - offers intriguing possibilities for controlling autonomous vehicles in critical situations. While drifting is a very dynamic process, occurring in a region of the state space with saturated tires and unstable equilibria, autonomous vehicles have been successfully controlled in this region. Previous control approaches to path tracking while drifting have relied on nonlinear vehicle models. In this paper, however, we demonstrate that linearized models capture the necessary dynamics for control in a large region surrounding a drift equilibrium. Using this linearized model, we develop a controller based on a linear quadratic regulator. This controller uses steering, throttle, and brakes to track both a desired path and a desired speed profile, making the system fully actuated.

Gated Adversarial Network Based Environmental Enhancement Method for Driving Safety Under Adverse Weather Conditions,"The adverse weather conditions have brought considerable difficulties in vision-based applications, which are closely related to the driving safety of autonomous vehicles. However, to date, the greater part of the existing environmental perception studies are under ordinary conditions, and the method to deal with the adverse weather conditions was ignored. Hence, this paper proposes an all-in-one gated adversarial network (AIO-GAN) to improve the performance of vision-based environment perception algorithms under adverse weather conditions, including in rain, haze, lack of light, etc. Three key technical contributions are made. At first, the deep learning based gated transformer module was proposed to classify the input mixed images to different collections by passing them through different branches. Second, the multi-branch based variational autoencoder-generative adversarial network was proposed to solve the ill-pose problem of the solution. Third, high-level weight sharing encoders was given out to guarantee the stability and the high quality of the training process. In this way, the unified clean-style images can be achieved, even if the mixed multi-modal images are transferred from the source domain of complex weather scenes. Extensive experimental results show that the proposed method has achieved better performance than state-of-the-arts and improved the accuracy of target detection.  © 2016 IEEE.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85123356408&doi=10.1109%2fTIV.2022.3142128&partnerID=40&md5=509bed680862e3383dadfd63851b951d,IEEE Transactions on Intelligent Vehicles,2023
Indirect adaptive neural tracking control of USVs under injection and deception attacks,"This paper investigates the tracking control issue of unmanned surface vessels (USVs) under internal/external uncertainties as well as injection and deception attacks, and proposes a novel adaptive neural network tracking control solution. In this work, the backstepping design framework is used to solve the control design issue. To resolve the time-varying gain caused by the injection and deception attacks, indirect adaptive neural and single-parameter learning approaches are employed. In the kinematic channel, internal and external uncertainties as well as the additional terms caused by the injection and deception attacks are regarded as heterogeneous uncertainties. And then, the heterogeneous uncertain term is transformed into a linearly parameterized form with only one parameter with the aid of the neural network technique and single-parameter learning approach. Furthermore, an adaptive law is constructed to update the unknown parameter, and an indirect adaptive neural learning approach is developed. Finally, a novel indirect adaptive neural tracking control solution is proposed to implement the suppression of heterogeneous uncertainties including internal and external uncertainties as well as attacks. The theoretical analysis indicates that all signals in the closed-loop tracking control system of USVs are bounded under the presented scheme.

Joint UAV Deployment and Resource Allocation: A Personalized Federated Deep Reinforcement Learning Approach,"Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) are capable of serving as aerial base stations (BSs) for providing dynamic coverage and connectivity extension for the sixth-generation (6G) wireless networks. While flexibility is provided, the deployment of the UAV swarms and the associated resource allocation become rather challenging due to the dynamic nature of UAVs and difficulty in obtaining global user information. In this article, we propose an adaptive and flexible joint UAV deployment and resource allocation (JUDRA) scheme by exploiting personalized federated deep reinforcement learning, called PFRL, with aim to maximize the long-term network throughput while enforcing user privacy and adapting to time-varying network states. To allow UAVs to make real-time decisions on resource allocation and position adjustment based on local observations while achieving a global optimal solution, a deep reinforcement learning (DRL) algorithm is adopted in the federated learning framework in PFRL. Specifically, we use DRL to train a local model and a personalized model on UAVs, and employ a two-level parameter aggregation scheme on a leading UAV to form a global model. The personalized model can adapt to changing environments, while exploiting the generalization of global model to accelerate the learning convergence.

An Analytical Latency Model and Evaluation of the Capacity of 5G NR to Support V2X Services Using V2N2V Communications,"5G has been designed to support applications such as connected and automated driving. To this aim, 5G includes a highly flexible New Radio (NR) interface that can be configured to utilize different subcarrier spacings (SCS), slot durations, scheduling, and retransmissions mechanisms. This flexibility can be exploited to support advanced V2X services with strict latency and reliability requirements using V2N2V (Vehicle-to-Network-to-Vehicles) communications instead of direct or sidelink V2V (Vehicle-to-Vehicle). To analyze this possibility, this paper presents a novel analytical model that estimates the latency of 5G at the radio network level. The model accounts for the use of different numerologies (SCS, slot durations and Cyclic Prefixes), modulation and coding schemes, full-slots or mini-slots, semi-static and dynamic scheduling, different retransmission mechanisms, and broadcast/multicast or unicast transmissions. The model has been used to first analyze the impact of different 5G NR radio configurations on the latency. We then identify which radio configurations and scenarios can 5G NR satisfy the latency and reliability requirements of V2X services using V2N2V communications. This paper considers cooperative lane changes as a case study. The results show that 5G can support advanced V2X services at the radio network level using V2N2V communications under certain conditions that depend on the radio configuration, bandwidth, service requirements and cell traffic load.  © 1967-2012 IEEE.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85139418080&doi=10.1109%2fTVT.2022.3208306&partnerID=40&md5=0fe6c744a6c286b394a92f340df8f771,IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology,2023
In-Vehicle CAN Bus Tampering Attacks Detection for Connected and Autonomous Vehicles Using an Improved Isolation Forest Method,"The development and applications of mobile communication technologies in intelligent autonomous transportation systems have led to an extraordinary rise in the mount of connected and autonomous vehicles (CAVs). Ensuring the security of in-vehicle communication data is the basis for the safety of cooperative transportation systems. An in-vehicle controller area network (CAN) bus is an important issue in in-vehicle security, and some hackers have mastered remote vehicle control methods through the CAN bus network. This paper proposes an improved isolation forest method with data mass (MS-iForest) for data tampering attack detection, in which we use data mass instead of the number of divisions and give an anomaly score ranking to quantify the degree of anomalies. This method is promising to be used as part of the intrusion detection system, like a security component in the onboard gateway, which can effectively avoid the data tampering attacks. We compare the proposed method with other anomaly detection schemes based on the data collected from an in-vehicle simulated dataset and two standard datasets. The experiment results show that the proposed method performs better than the other anomaly detection schemes in terms of the area under the receiver operating curve (AUC).  © 2000-2011 IEEE.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85121821851&doi=10.1109%2fTITS.2021.3128634&partnerID=40&md5=de5169e08fb2aed3f8d994085c3938a7,IEEE Transactions on Intelligent Transportation Systems,2023
"A Systematic Survey: Security Threats to UAV-Aided IoT Applications, Taxonomy, Current Challenges and Requirements with Future Research Directions","Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) as an intermediary can offer an efficient and useful communication paradigm for different Internet of Things (IoT) applications. Following the operational capabilities of IoTs, this emerging technology could be extremely helpful in the area, where human access is not possible. Because IoT devices are employed in an infrastructure-less environment, where they communicate with each other via the wireless medium to share accumulated data in network topological order. However, the unstructured deployment with wireless and dynamic communication make them disclosed to various security threats, which need to be addressed for their efficient results. Therefore, the primary objective of this work is to present a comprehensive survey of the theoretical literature associated with security concerns of this emerging technology from 2015-to-2022. To follow up this, we have overviewed different security threats of UAV-aided IoT applications followed by their countermeasures techniques to identify the current challenges and requirements of this emerging technology paradigm that must be addressed by researchers, enterprise market, and industry stakeholders. In light of underscored constrains, we have highlighted the open security challenges that could be assumed a move forward step toward setting the future research insights. By doing this, we set a preface for the answer to a question, why this paper is needed in the presence of published review articles. For novelty and uniqueness, we have performed a comparative analysis section-wise with rival papers to demonstrate that how this paper is different from them.  © 2000-2011 IEEE.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85141652180&doi=10.1109%2fTITS.2022.3220043&partnerID=40&md5=7a6ff976843cc76b25385f68c3425511,IEEE Transactions on Intelligent Transportation Systems,2023
Collaboration-Aware Relay Selection for AUV in Internet of Underwater Network: Evolving Contextual Bandit Learning Approach,"In Internet of Underwater Things, data collection is assisted by autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV) to enhance the reliable transmission. AUV acts as a mobile collector and transmits the collected data to the station via relay nodes. However, the highly mobile nature of AUV needs an adaptive and efficient relay selection scheme for achieving good capacity performance. In this article, we propose a new contextual multiarmed bandit with evolving relay set (CMAB-ERS) learning framework, which successfully addresses crucial issues, including dynamic environment conditions and evolving relay set. To deal with the evolving relay set, CMAB-ERS incorporates collaborative effects into inference as well as learning processes, the new relays will acquire prior knowledge by having experienced nodes sharing observations, reducing the learning time significantly. To overcome the uncertainty of environmental information, we exploit the contextual environment factors to assist relay reward estimation and execute time-sensitive parameter update after every transmit-receive cycle, aiming for minimizing potential loss due to the time-varying channel. Correspondingly, the collaboration-aware online contextual bandit learning (COCBL) algorithm is designed that enables AUV to switch optimal relay adaptively and promises high-capacity transmission. Further, we rigorously prove the convergence of the COCBL algorithm by considering the evolving relay set and give its upper bound on the cumulative regret. Finally, extensive simulation results elucidate the effectiveness of the proposed COCBL.  © 2014 IEEE.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85139871908&doi=10.1109%2fJIOT.2022.3211953&partnerID=40&md5=7a2fd2ec4676176b68a183b52a063f9b,IEEE Internet of Things Journal,2023
Unified Terrestrial/Aerial Motion Planning for HyTAQs via NMPC,"In this study, an NMPC-based planning approach is proposed for Hybrid Terrestrial and Aerial Quadrotors (HyTAQs) to achieve safe and efficient hybrid locomotion in unknown environments. The approach ensures bimodal dynamic feasibility and fully exploits the high efficiency and accessibility of HyTAQs. Equipped with the complementarity constraints for hybrid dynamics, the unified NMPC enables simultaneous optimization of the full-state trajectory and the inherent locomotion mode without the computational burden of mixed-integer programming. Also, the uncertainty bounds are evaluated along the nominal trajectory in a receding horizon manner and incorporated within the geometry constraints for the safety and robustness. Further, the bimodal energy efficiency is fully considered by the topology-guided path searching, achieving more efficient mode selection. Then, a compact unified terrestrial-aerial planner is implemented on the HyTAQ and validated through various comparisons and navigation tests. Experimental results verify the high efficiency and robustness of the proposed approach. © 2022 IEEE.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85147268913&doi=10.1109%2fLRA.2023.3236839&partnerID=40&md5=dd69958562cab3cf712583a83fd56e77,IEEE Robotics and Automation Letters,2023
Blockchain-Based Efficient Access Control With Handover Policy in IoV-Enabled Intelligent Transportation System,"Recent advances in Internet technology and IoT devices have facilitated researchers to foster a wide range of Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS) that improve the quality of automated transportation by addressing real-time safety and traffic management issues. The participating ITS agents, such as smart cars and roadside equipment, are required to communicate urgently through an open (unsecured) wireless channel in an unattended setting. To address the security issues, several vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) and vehicle-to-infrastructure (V2I) authentication and access control protocols have been proposed in recent times. However, fast-moving vehicles need to set up frequent authentication with different roadside units, which induces high computation and communication overheads. Consequently, it becomes a bottleneck for the resource-limited vehicle onboard unit devices. As the blockchain supports decentralized storage with data integrity and transparency, in this article, we design a secure and lightweight Internet of Vehicles (IoV)-enabled blockchain-based access control protocol with a handover authentication facility (we call it BACHP-IoV, in short). The handover authentication mechanism exploits no computation-costly cryptographic primitives. Once the transactions or messages have been securely gathered by a roadside unit (RSU), RSUj, residing in a group of vehicles V hi, will form a partial block, which is later forwarded to a cloud server node in the Peer-to-Peer (P2P) cloud servers blockchain network for converting it into a full block. Next, the full blocks are mined using a voting-based consensus algorithm. In addition, the in-charge trusted authority T A uploads information about the registered vehicles, such as randomized masked passwords and random secrets, to the blockchain. Thus, an RSUj can check the authenticity of a particular vehicle as well. We prove the security strength of the proposed BACHP-IoV by using the well-known Real-or-Random (ROR)-based random oracle model, the ProVerif 2.03 simulation tool, and informal security analysis. We have implemented the proposed BACHP-IoV through network simulator 3 (NS-3) and blockchain, and the simulation results demonstrate that BACHP-IoV is practical in a real-life scenario. A detailed comparative analysis also shows that BACHP-IoV provides significantly better security and efficiency than the existing competing schemes. © 2023 IEEE.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85174811789&doi=10.1109%2fTVT.2023.3322637&partnerID=40&md5=be2214b2ffa1a0d7e51d55df3f80f233,IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology,2023
"A Systematic Literature Review on Automotive Digital Forensics: Challenges, Technical Solutions and Data Collection","A modern vehicle has a complex internal architecture and is wirelessly connected to the Internet, other vehicles, and the infrastructure. The risk of cyber attacks and other criminal incidents along with recent road accidents caused by autonomous vehicles calls for more research on automotive digital forensics. Failures in automated driving functions can be caused by hardware and software failures and cyber security issues. Thus, it is imperative to be able to determine and investigate the cause of these failures, something which requires trustable data. However, automotive digital forensics is a relatively new field for the automotive where most existing self-monitoring and diagnostic systems in vehicles only monitor safety-related events. To the best of our knowledge, our work is the first systematic literature review on the current research within this field. We identify and assess over 300 papers published between 2006-2021 and further map the relevant papers to different categories based on identified focus areas to give a comprehensive overview of the forensics field and the related research activities. Moreover, we identify forensically relevant data from the literature, link the data to categories, and further map them to required security properties and potential stakeholders. Our categorization makes it easy for practitioners and researchers to quickly find relevant work within a particular sub-field of digital forensics. We believe our contributions can guide digital forensic investigations in automotive and similar areas, such as cyber-physical systems and smart cities, facilitate further research, and serve as a guideline for engineers implementing forensics mechanisms.  © 2016 IEEE.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85134220336&doi=10.1109%2fTIV.2022.3188340&partnerID=40&md5=d0718a1cb660dee770cce81de7644c90,IEEE Transactions on Intelligent Vehicles,2023
Nussbaum-type function based robust neural event-triggered control of unmanned surface vehicle subject to cyber and physical attacks,"This paper mainly focuses on the path-following control of the unmanned surface vehicle (USV) with the consideration of cyber and physical attacks. The actuator of USV has fully unknown dynamics under deception attack, and the USV system consists of complex nonlinear perturbations caused by physical attack. Therefore, a Nussbaum-type function based robust neural event-triggered path-following control scheme is proposed by combining event-triggered technique with Nussbaum approach. Together with hybrid disturbances and model uncertainties, the lumped nonlinearity is online approximated by employing the robust neural damping technique. Within the backstepping framework, a Nussbaum gain function is further designed to tackle unknown control directions in the actuator system. To facilitate the implementation of the proposed algorithm, an input-based event-triggered mechanism is introduced to reduce the channels clogging and the resources wasting between controllers and actuators. Theoretical analysis reveals that all signals of the closed-loop tracking system are bounded and tracking errors can converge to an arbitrarily small neighborhood of zero. Numerical simulation is performed by employing a class of underactuated surface cable-laying vehicle. The corresponding results demonstrate the effectiveness and superiority of the proposed approach. © 2023 Elsevier Ltd",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85146264192&doi=10.1016%2fj.oceaneng.2023.113664&partnerID=40&md5=5fb37d387ce4fc1f644181d778be91c3,Ocean Engineering,2023
Increasing the Confidence of Deep Neural Networks by Coverage Analysis,"The great performance of machine learning algorithms and deep neural networks in several perception and control tasks is pushing the industry to adopt such technologies in safety-critical applications, as autonomous robots and self-driving vehicles. At present, however, several issues need to be solved to make deep learning methods more trustworthy, predictable, safe, and secure against adversarial attacks. Although several methods have been proposed to improve the trustworthiness of deep neural networks, most of them are tailored for specific classes of adversarial examples, hence failing to detect other corner cases or unsafe inputs that heavily deviate from the training samples. This paper presents a lightweight monitoring architecture based on coverage paradigms to enhance the model robustness against different unsafe inputs. In particular, four coverage analysis methods are proposed and tested in the architecture for evaluating multiple detection logic. Experimental results show that the proposed approach is effective in detecting both powerful adversarial examples and out-of-distribution inputs, introducing limited extra-execution time and memory requirements. © 1976-2012 IEEE.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85127515714&doi=10.1109%2fTSE.2022.3163682&partnerID=40&md5=9fce1502609e0caf3a23bf3ea0e58b49,IEEE Transactions on Software Engineering,2023
Machine Learning Insights for Behavioral Data Analysis Supporting the Autonomous Vehicles Scenario,"The advent of the digital innovation era is changing service, use, and resources management paradigms, offering a wide range of new and essential opportunities. In particular, the advent of the Internet of Things (IoT), i.e., the ability to connect individual objects to the Internet, also capable of communicating autonomously, has its particular declination on the connected vehicle. It is combined with the potential of advanced sensors placed pervasively on vehicles, which offer multifunctional monitoring capabilities of the entire system: from individual components up to the whole vehicle, including driver behavior and conditions and many exogenous parameters to the vehicle (road and weather conditions, congestion, risk situations, changes to mobility plans, etc.). In this perspective, machine learning (ML) models can transform raw data into new knowledge; they can contribute in an innovative way to define and suggest decisions, strategies, and criteria for resource use. Nowadays, most intelligent mobility projects also integrate artificial intelligence (AI) and ML solutions. In this article, we present and discuss the application of unsupervised learning techniques on a vehicular IoT data set.

Motion Estimation and Compensation in Automotive MIMO SAR,"With the advent of self-driving vehicles, autonomous driving systems will have to rely on a vast number of heterogeneous sensors to perform dynamic perception of the surrounding environment. Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) systems increase the resolution of conventional mass-market radars by exploiting the vehicle's ego-motion, requiring very accurate knowledge of the trajectory, usually not compatible with automotive-grade navigation systems. In this setting, radar data are typically used to refine the navigation-based trajectory estimation with so-called autofocus algorithms. Although widely used in remote sensing applications, where the timeliness of the imaging is not an issue, autofocus in automotive scenarios calls for simple yet effective processing options to enable real-time environment imaging. This paper aims at providing a comprehensive theoretical and experimental analysis of the autofocus requirements in typical automotive scenarios. We analytically derive the effects of navigation-induced trajectory estimation errors on SAR imaging, in terms of defocusing and wrong targets' localization. Then, we propose a motion estimation and compensation workflow tailored to automotive applications, leveraging a set of stationary Ground Control Points (GCPs) in the low-resolution radar images (before SAR focusing). We theoretically discuss the impact of the GCPs position and focusing height on SAR imaging, highlighting common pitfalls and possible countermeasures. Finally, we show the effectiveness of the proposed technique employing experimental data gathered during open road campaign by a 77 GHz multiple-input multiple-output radar mounted in a forward-looking configuration. © 2000-2011 IEEE.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85141550168&doi=10.1109%2fTITS.2022.3219542&partnerID=40&md5=ffa1dce1ef2f18e62c7cd98807a53559,IEEE Transactions on Intelligent Transportation Systems,2023
Lightweight Trustworthy Message Exchange in Unmanned Aerial Vehicle Networks,"Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) networks have huge potential for a variety of military and civilian uses, such as intelligent transportation system, smart city, and so on. The 6th Generation (6G) communication technology is expected to provide 3-Dimensional (3D) wireless coverage and greatly improve the performance of UAV networks. The UAV-to-UAV (U2U) message exchange (or message exchange for short) is an important basis of multi-UAV cooperation. However, due to the unique characteristics of UAV networks, the U2U messages (or messages for short) are vulnerable to both the external and internal attackers. In this work, we propose a Lightweight Trustworthy Message Exchange (LTME) scheme for UAV networks by efficiently aggregating the cryptography and trust management technologies. In the LTME scheme, a centralized Ground Control Station (GCS) periodically updates the reputation levels of registered UAVs (or UAVs for short) and securely distributes secret values to the UAVs. Based on the received secret values, each trustworthy broadcasting UAV can generate its encrypted messages so that only trustworthy receiving UAVs can decrypt them, and each trustworthy receiving UAV can accurately judge whether the received messages and the corresponding broadcasting UAVs are trustworthy in a lightweight manner. Furthermore, we present a simplified LTME (sLTME) scheme and conduct a comprehensive theoretical analysis and simulation evaluation for the LTME and sLTME schemes. The results demonstrate that the proposed schemes can provide rich functionality and strong robustness with low computation and communication overheads, and are significantly superior to the existing schemes in several aspects.  © 2000-2011 IEEE.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85122109545&doi=10.1109%2fTITS.2021.3136304&partnerID=40&md5=3e86133170b247aa32d4a83e2edadddf,IEEE Transactions on Intelligent Transportation Systems,2023
Mobility-Aware Multi-Hop Task Offloading for Autonomous Driving in Vehicular Edge Computing and Networks,"Vehicular Edge Computing (VEC) has gained increasing interest due to its potential to provide low latency and reduce the load in backhaul networks. In order to meet drastically increasing computation demands from emerging ever-growing vehicular applications, e.g., autonomous driving, abundant computation resources of individual vehicles can play a crucial role in task execution in a VEC scenario, that can further contribute in considerably improving user experience. This is however an extremely challenging task due to high mobility of vehicles that can easily lead to intermittent connectivity, thereby disrupting on-going task processing. In this paper, we propose a task offloading scheme by exploiting multi-hop vehicle computation resources in VEC based on mobility analysis of vehicles. In addition to the vehicles within one hop from the task vehicle that generates computation tasks, certain multi-hop vehicles that meet the given requirements in terms of link connectivity and computation capacity, are also leveraged to carry out the tasks offloaded by the task vehicle. An optimization problem is formulated for the task vehicle to minimize the weighted sum of execution time and computation cost of all tasks. A semidefinite relaxation approach with an adaptive adjustment procedure is proposed to solve the formulated optimization problem for obtaining the corresponding offloading decisions. The simulation results show that our proposed offloading scheme can achieve significant improvement in terms of response delay by at least 34% compared with the other algorithms (e.g., local processing and random offloading).  © 2000-2011 IEEE.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85123354169&doi=10.1109%2fTITS.2022.3142566&partnerID=40&md5=114d2b48067d63d92d8465ce3c8806f7,IEEE Transactions on Intelligent Transportation Systems,2023
UAV trajectory planning for disaster scenarios,"Due to the unavailability of the traditional network in disaster scenarios, users are often unable to communicate with the first responders. In this regard, Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) as an Aerial Base Station (ABS) and user equipments (UEs) with Device-to-Device communication (D2D) mode, provide an alternative for enabling end-to-end connectivity between UEs and first responders. To effectively utilize D2D mode, in this paper, we first propose a k-value selection method (RSAND) relating three communication factors: area, receiver sensitivity, and density. For ensuring end-to-end connectivity between the clustered UEs, two UAV trajectory planning algorithms are proposed based on the RSAND and K-means centroids. In addition, two cluster head (CH) selection schemes are proposed based on UAV trajectory to select a more suitable node as a cluster head (CH) to ensure it is in the proximity of ABS. The performance of proposed schemes is analyzed based on average end-to-end outage probability. Simulation results show that the proposed algorithms have better performance over benchmark schemes, in terms of average end-to-end outage probability and trajectory length. Moreover, a case study of a real terrorist attack scenario is carried out to validate the efficacy of the proposed solution. © 2022 Elsevier Inc.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85146449652&doi=10.1016%2fj.vehcom.2022.100568&partnerID=40&md5=2fd9732ef564e9b527948bb1870ee9dd,Vehicular Communications,2023
MLB-IoD: Multi Layered Blockchain Assisted 6G Internet of Drones Ecosystem,"The Internet of Drones (IoD) ecosystem consists of many interlinked commercial services provided by a network of drones. The advent of 6G networks plays a crucial role in increasing the feasibility of the IoD ecosystem. This ecosystem's sheer size and low computational efficiency create challenges in maintaining compliance and control. The 6G IoD ecosystem can incorporate a blockchain-based multi layered compliance and control system to solve the significant trust and authentication issues. Implementing authentication mechanisms and UAV-user identity data in the blockchain layer can preserve the integrity of these authentication mechanisms.

Secure Control Design for Networked Control Systems With Nonlinear Dynamics Under Time-Delay-Switch Attacks,"A continuous controller is developed for a centralized network control system (NCS), which is composed of agents with nonlinear dynamics subject to a time-delay-switch (TDS) attack and additive disturbances. Since the state tracking error is unmeasurable during TDS attacks, controllers cannot use the state tracking error to coordinate the NCS. Therefore, a novel error signal is designed to address this unique challenge and enable the NCS to achieve a formation control objective. Furthermore, a TDS attack mitigation strategy is developed, which uses both learning-and model-based approaches to estimate an agent's state for TDS attack detection and compensation. Lyapunov-Krasovskii functionals are used in the stability analysis to prove that the tracking errors converge to a steady-state residual, which is a function of the system uncertainty and TDS attack properties.

LSTM-Based Distributed Conditional Generative Adversarial Network for Data-Driven 5G-Enabled Maritime UAV Communications,"5G enabled maritime unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) communication is one of the important applications of 5G wireless network which requires minimum latency and higher reliability to support mission-critical applications. Therefore, lossless reliable communication with a high data rate is the key requirement in modern wireless communication systems. These all factors highly depend upon channel conditions. In this work, a channel model is proposed for air-to-surface link exploiting millimeter wave (mmWave) for 5G enabled maritime unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) communication. Firstly, we will present the formulated channel estimation method which directly aims to adopt channel state information (CSI) of mmWave from the channel model inculcated by UAV operating within the Long Short Term Memory (LSTM)-Distributed Conditional generative adversarial network (DCGAN) i.e. (LSTM-DCGAN) for each beamforming direction. Secondly, to enhance the applications for the proposed trained channel model for the spatial domain, we have designed an LSTM-DCGAN based UAV network, where each one will learn mmWave CSI for all the distributions. Lastly, we have categorized the most favorable LSTM-DCGAN training method and emanated certain conditions for our UAV network to increase the channel model learning rate. Simulation results have shown that the proposed LSTM-DCGAN based network is vigorous to the error generated through local training. A detailed comparison has been done with the other available state-of-the-art CGAN network architectures i.e. stand-alone CGAN (without CSI sharing), Simple CGAN (with CSI sharing), multi-discriminator CGAN, federated learning CGAN and DCGAN.

Application of Graph Learning With Multivariate Relational Representation Matrix in Vehicular Social Networks,"The essence of connection in vehicle network is the social relationship between people, and thus Vehicular Social Networks (VSNs), characterized by social aspects and features, can be formed. The information collected by VSNs can be used for context prediction of autonomous vehicles. Multivariate relations are common in square connected relations caused by geographic characteristics in VSNs. They can effectively reflect the high-order structural features of the network dataset. It is necessary to exploit the multivariate relations of VSNs to improve the performance of context prediction. However, The representation of entity-relationes in the network often adopts a binary form, and the existing graph learning methods rely on the neighborhood information of nodes to achieve the aggregation or diffusion of information. Using this to represent multivariate relations will result in partial omissions or even complete loss of valuable information, which ultimately affects the learning effect of learning methods. In order to better understand the social behavior of the VSNs, this paper uses the network motif to implement the representation of the multivariate relations in the network, and proposes the graPh learnIng with moTif mAtrix (PITA) method. This method can be used as a preprocessing step for the measurement strategy of the relations in VSNs and the graph learning, which can mine the information in VSNs and improve the accuracy of the original graph learning method by the multivariate relation information. We performed experiments on 6 network datasets.

Autonomous vehicles can share their local views for cooperative, reliable, and robust driving decisions. However, the limited wireless resources may become the bottleneck with the increasing number of vehicles. The technical challenges also arise from the decentralized control, the spatial couplings of decisions, and the complexity of combinatorial optimization. This paper proposes a novel fully distributed graph-based approach to jointly optimize multicast link establishment with data dissemination and processing decisions by only exchanging partial information among neighboring vehicles. The mixed-integer programming problem aims to maximize system energy efficiency while achieving maximum data throughput. We prove that maximizing data processing throughput is submodular optimization to find the local optimum efficiently. The optimization of data dissemination and processing is reformulated to a minimum-cost maximum-flow problem in a three-layer graph, and efficiently solved by exploiting the graphical interdependence. Both simulation-generated and trace-based datasets are evaluated to validate the effectiveness of the proposed approach in terms of data throughput and energy efficiency.  © 2000-2011 IEEE.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85144772721&doi=10.1109%2fTITS.2022.3226198&partnerID=40&md5=1ebbf58dcae57ef0c2ba218caa99acbd,IEEE Transactions on Intelligent Transportation Systems,2023
Wheel-INS2: Multiple MEMS IMU-Based Dead Reckoning System With Different Configurations for Wheeled Robots,"A reliable self-contained navigation system is essential for autonomous vehicles. Based on our previous study on Wheel-INS [1], a wheel-mounted inertial measurement unit (Wheel-IMU)-based dead reckoning (DR) system, in this paper, we propose a multiple IMUs-based DR solution for the wheeled robots. The IMUs are mounted at different places on the wheeled vehicles to acquire various dynamic information. In particular, at least one IMU has to be mounted at the wheel to measure the wheel velocity and take advantage of the rotation modulation. The system is implemented through a distributed extended Kalman filter structure where each subsystem (corresponding to each IMU) retains and updates its own states separately. The relative position constraints between the multiple IMUs are exploited to further limit the error drift and improve the system's robustness. Particularly, we present the DR systems using dual Wheel-IMUs, one Wheel-IMU plus one vehicle body-mounted IMU (Body-IMU), and dual Wheel-IMUs plus one Body-IMU as examples for analysis and comparison. Field tests illustrate that the proposed multi-IMU DR system outperforms the single Wheel-INS in terms of both positioning and heading accuracy. By comparing with the centralized filter, the proposed distributed filter shows unimportant accuracy degradation while holding significant computation efficiency. Moreover, among the three multi-IMU configurations, the one Body-IMU plus one Wheel-IMU design obtains the minimum drift rate. The position drift rates of the three configurations are 0.82% (dual Wheel-IMUs), 0.69% (one Body-IMU plus one Wheel-IMU), and 0.73% (dual Wheel-IMUs plus one Body-IMU), respectively.  © 2000-2011 IEEE.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85142810773&doi=10.1109%2fTITS.2022.3220508&partnerID=40&md5=4d2b99a2e046a44b8932f4a67cb2e616,IEEE Transactions on Intelligent Transportation Systems,2023
LoS-Map Construction for Proactive Relay of Opportunity Selection in 6G V2X Systems,"Recent advances in Vehicle-To-Everything (V2X) technology and the upcoming sixth-generation (6G) network will dawn a new era for vehicular services with enhanced communication capabilities. Connected and Autonomous Vehicles (CAVs) are expected to deliver a new transportation experience, increasing the safety and efficiency of road networks. The use of millimeter-wave (mmW) frequencies guarantees a huge amount of bandwidth (>1 GHz) and a high data rate (>10 Gbit/s), which are required for CAVs applications. However, high frequency is impaired by severe path loss, and line of sight (LoS) propagation can be easily blocked by static and dynamic obstacles. Several solutions are being investigated, and the most promising one exploits relays. However, traditional relay schemes react to link failure and leverage instantaneous information, which impedes efficient relay selection in highly mobile and complex networks, such as vehicular scenarios. In this context, we propose a novel proactive relaying strategy that exploits the cooperation between CAVs and environment information to predict the dynamic LoS-map, which describes the links' evolution in time. The proactive relaying schemes exploit the dynamic LoS-map to maximize the network connectivity. A novel framework integrating realistic mobility patterns and geometric channel propagation models is proposed to analyze the performance in different scenarios. Numerical simulations suggest that a novel proactive relaying strategy that exploits the cooperation between CAVs and environment information to predict the dynamic LoS-map, which describes the links' evolution in time.  © 1967-2012 IEEE.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85141489543&doi=10.1109%2fTVT.2022.3217966&partnerID=40&md5=41658e68189a42afc74c27e730c4bb0d,IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology,2023
Modeling Human Driving Behavior Through Generative Adversarial Imitation Learning,"An open problem in autonomous vehicle safety validation is building reliable models of human driving behavior in simulation. This work presents an approach to learn neural driving policies from real world driving demonstration data. We model human driving as a sequential decision making problem that is characterized by non-linearity and stochasticity, and unknown underlying cost functions. Imitation learning is an approach for generating intelligent behavior when the cost function is unknown or difficult to specify. Building upon work in inverse reinforcement learning (IRL), Generative Adversarial Imitation Learning (GAIL) aims to provide effective imitation even for problems with large or continuous state and action spaces, such as modeling human driving. This article describes the use of GAIL for learning-based driver modeling. Because driver modeling is inherently a multi-agent problem, where the interaction between agents needs to be modeled, this paper describes a parameter-sharing extension of GAIL called PS-GAIL to tackle multi-agent driver modeling. In addition, GAIL is domain agnostic, making it difficult to encode specific knowledge relevant to driving in the learning process. This paper describes Reward Augmented Imitation Learning (RAIL), which modifies the reward signal to provide domain-specific knowledge to the agent. Finally, human demonstrations are dependent upon latent factors that may not be captured by GAIL. This paper describes Burn-InfoGAIL, which allows for disentanglement of latent variability in demonstrations. Imitation learning experiments are performed using NGSIM, a real-world highway driving dataset. Experiments show that these modifications to GAIL can successfully model highway driving behavior, accurately replicating human demonstrations and generating realistic, emergent behavior in the traffic flow arising from the interaction between driving agents.  © 2000-2011 IEEE.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85149616022&doi=10.1109%2fTITS.2022.3227738&partnerID=40&md5=bedd44cf5b603b8161b122766cd73dd4,IEEE Transactions on Intelligent Transportation Systems,2023
User Selection and Codebook Design for NOMA-Based High Altitude Platform Station (HAPS) Communications,"High altitude platform station (HAPS) communications have made a tremendous impact on recent research into sixth-generation (6G) and beyond wireless networks. The large coverage area and significant computational capability of HAPS systems enable many areas of utilization in 6G and beyond applications, including Internet of Things (IoT) services, augmented reality, and connected autonomous vehicles. In addition, non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) is a cutting-edge technology that can be utilized to enhance spectral efficiency in HAPS systems. In this paper, we exploit NOMA-based HAPS communications and multiple antennas to meet the connectivity, reliability, and high-data-rate requirements of 6G and beyond applications. We propose a user selection and correlation-based user pairing algorithm for a NOMA-based multi-user HAPS system. Moreover, we investigate the codebook design for HAPS communication and adapt the polar-cap codebook (PCC) to the HAPS channel which shows Rician fading propagation characteristics dominated by the line-of-sight (LOS) component. Performance evaluations show that the proposed user selection algorithm is perfectly suited to the HAPS channel and that the PCC provides a remarkable spectral efficiency.  © 1967-2012 IEEE.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85141569193&doi=10.1109%2fTVT.2022.3220647&partnerID=40&md5=f214ca3e57dad77efb6df2aa43a9f7e3,IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology,2023
Safety-Critical and Flexible Cooperative On-Ramp Merging Control of Connected and Automated Vehicles in Mixed Traffic,"Cooperative on-ramp merging control for connected and automated vehicles (CAVs) can effectively improve traffic throughput and vehicle fuel efficiency at highway on-ramp merging bottlenecks. However, in the mixed traffic scenario where CAVs and human-driven vehicles (HDVs) coexist, the uncertain maneuvers of human drivers pose a major challenge to merging control in terms of safety and flexibility. To this end, this paper proposes a hierarchical cooperative on-ramp merging control strategy for CAVs to optimize flexible trajectories with safety guarantees in mixed traffic. First, the on-ramp merging control problem for CAVs is considered in the case of a three-vehicle coordination, resulting in an optimal control problem (OCP) coordinating on-ramp and main-lane CAVs for efficient operation while satisfying multiple safety-critical constraints. Second, a two-level hierarchical control architecture is developed to solve the OCP with mixed state-control constraints. The upper-level planner solves an unconstrained OCP with Pontryagin's Minimum Principle to calculate an expected merging position, which is embedded in the variable time headway of safe merging constraints in the lower-level controller. Then, the controller converts the nonlinear OCP with safety-critical constraints to a quadratic programing (QP) problem by exploiting Control Barrier Functions (CBFs) and Control Lyapunov Functions (CLFs). By solving the QP efficiently, the time and energy efficient trajectory for each CAV is obtained. In addition, a receding horizon control framework is employed, which enables CAVs to determine flexible merging opportunity and tackle the disturbances caused by HDVs. Finally, comprehensive simulation results show that the proposed cooperative on-ramp merging strategy has potential in enabling merging flexibility, improving traffic efficiency and energy economy in real time.  © 2000-2011 IEEE.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85149369632&doi=10.1109%2fTITS.2022.3224592&partnerID=40&md5=29ff458d401e35707d318d70d91164cc,IEEE Transactions on Intelligent Transportation Systems,2023
RDA: An Accelerated Collision Free Motion Planner for Autonomous Navigation in Cluttered Environments,"Autonomous motion planning is challenging in multi-obstacle environments due to nonconvex collision avoidance constraints. Directly applying numerical solvers to these nonconvex formulations fails to exploit the constraint structures, resulting in excessive computation time. In this letter, we present an accelerated collision-free motion planner, namely regularized dual alternating direction method of multipliers (RDADMM or RDA for short), for the model predictive control (MPC) based motion planning problem. The proposed RDA addresses nonconvex motion planning via solving a smooth biconvex reformulation via duality and allows the collision avoidance constraints to be computed in parallel for each obstacle to reduce computation time significantly. We validate the performance of the RDA planner through path-tracking experiments with car-like robots in both simulation and real-world settings. Experimental results show that the proposed method generates smooth collision-free trajectories with less computation time compared with other benchmarks and performs robustly in cluttered environments.  © 2016 IEEE.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85148455314&doi=10.1109%2fLRA.2023.3242138&partnerID=40&md5=1b25cec05aea501b449073699c9391d8,IEEE Robotics and Automation Letters,2023
WKN-OC: A New Deep Learning Method for Anomaly Detection in Intelligent Vehicles,"Connected and automated vehicles (CAVs) play a vital role in transforming human mobility, tackling road congestion and road safety. However, CAVs rely heavily on the security, accuracy, and stability of sensor readings and network data. Abnormal sensor readings caused by malicious cyberattacks or faulty car sensors can have devastating consequences, possibly even lead to a fatal crash. In order to avoid the CAVs data anomalies caused by network attacks or data failures, we propose a Wavelet Kernel Network with Omni-Scale Convolutional (WKN-OC) for anomaly detection in intelligent transportation systems (ITS), which can select the optimal scale adaptively and processes high-frequency signals better. The proposed method pays more attention to the high-frequency components of input data, and fully extracts valuable features through the feature extraction framework, so that the model has strong anomaly detection performance. We verify the reliability of the WKN-OC method on the Safe Pilot Model Deployment (SPMD) data set. It is shown that the proposed WKN-OC model has good detection performance for various anomaly data, especially in the mixed anomaly experiment. We have achieved 96.78% average accuracy in mixed anomaly experiments and 96.13% accuracy in multi anomaly experiments. The results show that the model has strong generalization performance for the anomaly detection problem faced by the Internet of Vehicles (IoVs) and can identify the unknown anomalies in reality well.  © 2016 IEEE.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85149408876&doi=10.1109%2fTIV.2023.3243356&partnerID=40&md5=58d70a1f2cb684011d7fc4d75c710841,IEEE Transactions on Intelligent Vehicles,2023
Exploiting Multi-Modal Fusion for Urban Autonomous Driving Using Latent Deep Reinforcement Learning,"Human driving decisions are the leading cause of road fatalities. Autonomous driving naturally eliminates such incompetent decisions and thus can improve traffic safety and efficiency. Deep reinforcement learning (DRL) has shown great potential in learning complex tasks. Recently, researchers investigated various DRL-based approaches for autonomous driving. However, exploiting multi-modal fusion to generate perception and motion prediction and then leveraging these predictions to train a latent DRL has not been targeted yet. To that end, we propose enhancing urban autonomous driving using multi-modal fusion with latent DRL. A single LIDAR sensor is used to extract bird's-eye view (BEV), range view (RV), and residual input images. These images are passed into LiCaNext, a real-Time multi-modal fusion network, to produce accurate joint perception and motion prediction. Next, predictions are fed with another simple BEV image into the latent DRL to learn a complex end-To-end driving policy ensuring safety, efficiency, and comfort. A sequential latent model is deployed to learn more compact representations from inputs, leading to improved sampling efficiency for reinforcement learning. Our experiments are simulated on CARLA and evaluated against state-of-The-Art DRL models. Results manifest that our method learns a better driving policy that outperforms other prevailing models. Further experiments are conducted to reveal the effectiveness of our proposed approach under different environments and varying weather conditions.  © 1967-2012 IEEE.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85141646641&doi=10.1109%2fTVT.2022.3217299&partnerID=40&md5=d0c018fda0245959d1db79d61e5ae337,IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology,2023
Numerical study on the hull–propeller interaction of autonomous underwater vehicle,"The hull–propeller interaction of autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV) in straight and oblique flow is numerically studied. The study is performed based on computational fluid dynamics (CFD) and the general commercial software ANSYS Workbench. The multiple reference frames (MRF) method and the shear stress transport (SST) k−ω turbulence model are adopted. Firstly, the drag of Suboff AUV and the open water performance of the Wageningen B-3-50 propeller are simulated numerically. The errors are all within 5%, validating the reliability of the method in this paper. Then, the Sailfish AUV and B-3-35 propeller developed by the Underwater Vehicle Laboratory (UVL) of Ocean University of China are simulated. The maximum incremental drag produced by the appendages reaches even more than 1.5 times the hull drag. Propeller rotation causes an additional hull drag increment of over 25%. With an inlet velocity of 1.5 m/s, the thrust and torque behind the bare hull increase by 16.7% and 6.4%, respectively. The effect of angle of attack on drag is more significant at high velocity. Finally, the numerical simulation result 1.825 m/s and experimental result 1.75 m/s are compared. This study has implications for guidance on AUV integration analysis. © 2023 Elsevier Ltd",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85147128826&doi=10.1016%2fj.oceaneng.2023.113777&partnerID=40&md5=f5f2e5f5e84e08f3fa64485b32fce807,Ocean Engineering,2023
Secure Long-Range Autonomous Valet Parking: A Reservation Scheme with Three-Factor Authentication and Key Agreement,"Long-range autonomous valet parking (LAVP) is a current trend, partly due to traffic congestion and parking headache. For large-scale parking demands, reservation is introduced to effectively manage valet parking. However, existing schemes focus on parking request verification and parking check-in, which aren't applicable to LAVP because they ignore identity legitimacy and communication security in the phase of picking up as well as dropping off passengers. One viable solution is authentication and key agreement (AKA) protocol. Generally, due to low entropy of passwords and dictionary attacks, three-factor (i.e. passwords, biometrics, and smart card) AKA is more secure than single- and two-factor AKA. Unfortunately, known attacks and high overheads hinder the application of three-factor AKA in real-world environments. Hence, one of the most tough tasks is to balance security and availability, especially how to address the potential threats introduced by each factor while taking full advantage of three factors. Inspired by the above challenges, we propose a provably secure three-factor AKA protocol for reservation services in LAVP, namely SecLAVP. Specifically, the passenger and the autonomous vehicle (AV) complete mutual authentication with the assistance of drop-off/pick-up point (DP). After successful authentication, the session key is generated between the passenger, DP, and AV for secure communication. In the Real-Or-Random (ROR) model, we formally prove SecLAVP satisfies session-key security. Then, we apply AVISPA to simulate our proposed protocol, to demonstrate that SecLAVP can resist man-in-the-middle attacks. Additionally, informal security analysis indicates that SecLAVP satisfies our defined 16 design goals concerning security. Finally, we evaluate performance of SecLAVP in terms of communication overheads, computational overheads, and scheduling, to manifest the feasibility.  © 1967-2012 IEEE.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85141521968&doi=10.1109%2fTVT.2022.3217371&partnerID=40&md5=9ad97498b9ca6670a2d27b08bc67de74,IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology,2023
"Unmanned-Aerial-Vehicle-Assisted Wireless Networks: Advancements, Challenges, and Solutions","The rapid development of communication and computing techniques enables unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) to provide reliable and cost-effective wireless communication and computing services from the air. Compared to the conventional fixed infrastructure, UAVs have attractive attributes, such as high flexibility and operability, and, as a result, on-demand line-of-sight connection links. Therefore, UAV-assisted wireless networks have been envisioned as a promising paradigm to achieve enhanced coverage and connectivity for future wireless communications. Meanwhile, achieving high levels of energy efficiency, sensing, communication, and computing capacities, and security and privacy are critical to the success of UAV-assisted wireless networks. In order to improve the performance of UAV-assisted wireless networks, some frameworks and mechanisms have been developed in the past few years. In this article, we provide a comprehensive survey of these developments. Specifically, we conduct a brief overview for the architecture of UAV-assisted wireless networks from four domains (i.e., framework-related, technology-related, challenge-related, and solution-related) and four aspects (i.e., sensing-related, communication-related, computing-related, and application-related).

AD-RCNN: Adaptive Dynamic Neural Network for Small Object Detection,"With the large-scale commercialization of 5G networks, Internet of Things (IoT) applications keep on emerging in recent years. Real-time environmental awareness is an essential part of various IoT applications, e.g., self-driving vehicles. Object detection plays a fundamental role in real-time environmental awareness, which is responsible for acquiring valuable object information from the environment automatically. Despite of the fast progress for object detection in general, small object detection still faces challenges. Because of the restricted scales, small objects are only capable of generating relatively week features after multiple convolutional layers, thus causing low detection accuracy. Existing schemes mostly focus on extracting rich multiscale features, e.g., generating high-resolution features through generative adversarial networks (GANs), or generating multiscale features through feature combination. Nevertheless, these schemes require complex network implementation, and usually suffer from high processing delay because of high-resolution images. To resolve the problems mentioned above, we propose an adaptive dynamic neural network (AD-RCNN) that consists of three fundamental improvements. We first propose a dynamic region proposal network to improve the quality of region proposals. We then introduce a visual attention scheme to generate features of regions. Finally, we put forward an adaptive dynamic training module to optimize final detection results. Experimental results demonstrate that AD-RCNN outperforms the state-of-the-art from the perspectives of mAP and frames per second (FPS).

Machine Learning Modeling of GPS Features with Applications to UAV Location Spoofing Detection and Classification,"In this paper, machine learning (ML) modeling is proposed for the detection and classification of global positioning system (GPS) spoofing in unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs). Three testing scenarios are implemented in an outdoor yet controlled setup to investigate static and dynamic attacks. In these scenarios, authentic sets of GPS signal features are collected, followed by other sets obtained while the UAV is under spoofing attacks launched with a software-defined radio (SDR) transceiver module. All sets are standardized, analyzed for correlation, and reduced according to feature importance prior to their exploitation in training, validating, and testing different multiclass ML classifiers. The resulting performance evaluation of these classifiers shows a detection rate (DR), misdetection rate (MDR), and false alarm rate (FAR) better than 92%, 13%, and 4%, respectively, together with a sub-millisecond detection time. Hence, the proposed modeling facilitates accurate real-time GPS spoofing detection and classification for UAV applications. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85145256835&doi=10.1016%2fj.cose.2022.103085&partnerID=40&md5=61ff455d6772f5a62f3a4450afc31e79,Computers and Security,2023
Formulating Vehicle Aggressiveness Towards Social Cognitive Autonomous Driving,"Accurately identifying the driving threat could greatly improve the driving safety for autonomous vehicles in the mixed traffic, where the human-driven and driverless, as well as different types of vehicles coexist. The existing safety evaluation methods merely focus on the possibility of collision, which is deficient to evaluate the hazard level due to the symmetry for both the interactive vehicles. Thus, the vehicle aggressiveness model is proposed in this paper based on the asymmetric interactions between different types of vehicles from the perspective of the social cognitions in the human driving. Firstly, a new conceptual framework of the vehicle aggressiveness is constructed, and the factors are analyzed. Secondly, the general mathematic formulation of the aggressiveness is deduced elaborately based on the analogy with the mechanical wave. Thirdly, the simplified formulation is derived by introducing resonant assumption, and an illustration of aggressiveness distribution is presented and discussed. The mathematical analysis and simulation results indicate that the proposed model could explicitly describe the asymmetric characteristics as regards the vehicle mass, motion states and position. Finally, the potential applications in safety assessment, decision-making and motion planning of the social cognitive autonomous driving are discussed. The aggressiveness model provides a new perspective in asymmetric driving safety evaluation and heterogeneous driving behavior model under complex and mixed traffic environments.  © 2016 IEEE.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85147273130&doi=10.1109%2fTIV.2023.3234253&partnerID=40&md5=c8a071201e18e8d813683ded5ec5effc,IEEE Transactions on Intelligent Vehicles,2023
Non-Conservative Trajectory Planning for Automated Vehicles by Estimating Intentions of Dynamic Obstacles,"Motion planning algorithms for urban automated driving must handle uncertainty due to unknown intention and future motion of Dynamic Obstacles (DOs). Considering a single future trajectory for each DO is not adequate, especially in urban frameworks where traffic participants exhibit very different behaviors. However, including multiple candidate trajectories representing different behaviors results in an excess of conservatism. We present a novel combination of the Interactive Multiple Model (IMM) algorithm and Stochastic Model Predictive Control (SMPC) that allows non-conservative safe motion planning in presence of DOs with unknown intention. We introduce a framework based on LQR and IMM to predict multiple candidate future trajectories, each interpreted as a high-level intention that the DO is pursuing, and dynamically estimate their probabilities. Then, the future trajectory of the automated vehicle is iteratively planned in an SMPC fashion, in which collision avoidance constraints are generated for multiple future trajectories of each DO, with a focus on the most likely. Our method improves safe motion planning fully exploiting the benefits of multi-modal predictions of the DOs, avoiding excessive conservatism. Advantages of the proposed method are discussed through simulations in the CARLA environment.  © 2016 IEEE.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85147226503&doi=10.1109%2fTIV.2023.3234163&partnerID=40&md5=0851884cc00e8dd7155f77867031b740,IEEE Transactions on Intelligent Vehicles,2023
Flying Among Stars: Jamming-Resilient Channel Selection for UAVs Through Aerial Constellations,"Wireless communication between an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) and the ground base station is susceptible to adversarial jamming. In such situations, it is important for the UAV to indicate a new channel to the BS. This paper describes a method of creating spatial codes that map the chosen channel to the location of the UAVs in space, wherein the latter physically traverses the space from a given so called 'constellation points' to another. These points create patterns in the sky, analogous to modulation constellations in classical wireless communications, and are detected at the BS through a millimeter-wave radar sensor. A constellation point represents a distinct n-bit field mapped to a specific channel, allowing simultaneous frequency switching at both ends without any RF transmissions. The main contributions of this paper are: (i) We conduct experimental studies to demonstrate how such constellations may be formed using COTS UAVs and mmWave sensors, (ii) We develop a theoretical framework that maps a desired constellation design to error and band switching time, including multi-user scenario-specific challenges, (iii) We compare our approach against current FHSS technology and (iv) We experimentally demonstrate jamming resilient communications and validate system goodput for links formed by UAV-mounted software defined radios. © 2002-2012 IEEE.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85113260503&doi=10.1109%2fTMC.2021.3102883&partnerID=40&md5=4d792bb8a494c4a5919b3e344e734e9a,IEEE Transactions on Mobile Computing,2023
Multi-Agent System for Rogue Drone Interception,"A multitude of applications based on unmanned aircraft vehicles (UAVs), in conjunction with the UAVs' diminishing costs and increasing capabilities, present a major threat to public safety as well as critical infrastructure security, leading to the need for versatile and robust counter-drone solutions.

The proposed framework aims to select the best control actions for each UAV, in terms of joint mobility and jamming power, succeeding in optimally tracking and successfully jamming the rogue UAVs over time, while also ensuring that the power received by the pursuer UAVs remains below predefined interference levels. Additionally, the proposed framework minimizes the total energy consumption of the swarm of UAV agents (accounting for both jamming and propulsion energy consumption). The applicability and effectiveness of the proposed approach is validated through extensive simulation experiments for different pursuer-target scenarios, with UAVs utilizing both fixed- and rotary-wing technologies.  © 2007-2012 IEEE.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85132692487&doi=10.1109%2fJSYST.2022.3179632&partnerID=40&md5=26f3f1770180c063b205598200762879,IEEE Systems Journal,2023
Evaluating Surprise Adequacy for Deep Learning System Testing,"The rapid adoption of Deep Learning (DL) systems in safety critical domains such as medical imaging and autonomous driving urgently calls for ways to test their correctness and robustness. Borrowing from the concept of test adequacy in traditional software testing, existing work on testing of DL systems initially investigated DL systems from structural point of view, leading to a number of coverage metrics. Our lack of understanding of the internal mechanism of Deep Neural Networks (DNNs), however, means that coverage metrics defined on the Boolean dichotomy of coverage are hard to intuitively interpret and understand. We propose the degree of out-of-distribution-ness of a given input as its adequacy for testing: the more surprising a given input is to the DNN under test, the more likely the system will show unexpected behavior for the input. We develop the concept of surprise into a test adequacy criterion, called Surprise Adequacy (SA). Intuitively, SA measures the difference in the behavior of the DNN for the given input and its behavior for the training data. We posit that a good test input should be sufficiently, but not overtly, surprising compared to the training dataset. This article evaluates SA using a range of DL systems from simple image classifiers to autonomous driving car platforms, as well as both small and large data benchmarks ranging from MNIST to ImageNet. The results show that the SA value of an input can be a reliable predictor of the correctness of the mode behavior. We also show that SA can be used to detect adversarial examples, and also be efficiently computed against large training dataset such as ImageNet using sampling.  © 2023 Copyright held by the owner/author(s).

Real-Time Stereo 3D Car Detection With Shape-Aware Non-Uniform Sampling,"Pseudo-LiDAR based stereo 3D detectors have gained popularity due to their high accuracy. However, these methods need dense depth supervision and suffer from inferior speed. To solve these two issues, a recently introduced RTS3D builds an efficient 4D feature-consistency embedding (FCE) space for the object intermediate representation without depth supervision, where FCE space performs uniform sampling to generate feature sampling points, which ignores the importance of different object regions. In this paper, we observe that, compared with the inner region, the outer region of the object plays a more important role for accurate 3D detection. To fully exploit the useful information from the outer region, we propose a novel shape-aware non-uniform sampling strategy. Instead of uniform sampling, our proposed non-uniform sampling strategy performs dense sampling in outer region and sparse sampling in inner region. Therefore, more points are sampled from the outer region and more useful features are extracted for 3D detection. In addition, we design a high-level semantic enhanced FCE module to exploit more contextual information and suppress noise better. As a result, it further improves feature discrimination of each sampling point. Experimental results on the KITTI dataset show the effectiveness of the proposed method. Compared with the baseline RTS3D, our proposed method has 2.57% improvement on car AP $_{3d}$ almost without extra network parameters. Moreover, our proposed method outperforms the state-of-the-art methods without extra supervision at a real-time speed.  © 2000-2011 IEEE.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85149869788&doi=10.1109%2fTITS.2022.3220422&partnerID=40&md5=eebce203b0fec1a07878785287fbee10,IEEE Transactions on Intelligent Transportation Systems,2023
Lane-Change in Dense Traffic With Model Predictive Control and Neural Networks,"This article presents an online smooth-path lane-change control framework. We focus on dense traffic where intervehicle space gaps are narrow, and cooperation with surrounding drivers is essential to achieve the lane-change maneuver. We propose a two-stage control framework that harmonizes model predictive control (MPC) with generative adversarial networks (GANs) by utilizing driving intentions to generate smooth lane-change maneuvers. To improve performance in practice, the system is augmented with an adaptive safety boundary and a Kalman filter to mitigate sensor noise. Simulation studies are investigated at different levels of traffic density and cooperativeness of other drivers. The simulation results support the effectiveness, driving comfort, and safety of the proposed method.  © 1993-2012 IEEE.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85135763066&doi=10.1109%2fTCST.2022.3193923&partnerID=40&md5=7abf28b32bf6a5dfc5b1ef94bb07b6b3,IEEE Transactions on Control Systems Technology,2023
Reachability Analysis Plus Satisfiability Modulo Theories: An Adversary-Proof Control Method for Connected and Autonomous Vehicles,"Connected and autonomous vehicles (CAVs) are expected to operate with safety guarantee in presence of adversaries from the Internet of Vehicles. This article proposes a control method named reachability analysis plus satisfiability modulo theories (RA-SMT) for CAVs against integrity attacks caused by bounded adversary. This method enables vehicles to possess the reach-avoid specification and strict control safety ensurance even in the worst case scenario. The introduction of state-feedback control decomposes the original complex problem into more manageable reachability analysis and adversary-free control strategy optimization. Precisely, zonotope sets are employed for reachability analysis, and the control strategy is optimally solved and verified simultaneously via SMT. This method is applicable to complex traffic scenarios with the help of SMT, which can describe various constraints flexibly and conveniently. Simulation results reveal the effectiveness and safety of the proposed method in the classical car-following scenario against bounded adversary under various conditions. Particularly, RA-SMT exhibits significantly improved control performance (around 16%) and computation efficiency (around 63%) compared with existing methods. Finally, the RA-SMT is implemented on an autonomous driving platform to validate its practicability. © 1982-2012 IEEE.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85128586472&doi=10.1109%2fTIE.2022.3165293&partnerID=40&md5=2bbb48660c4329c729e97f7b4d0f223e,IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics,2023
Q-learning-based routing inspired by adaptive flocking control for collaborative unmanned aerial vehicle swarms,"A collaborative unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) swarm can support various applications, including aerial surveillance and emergency communication. Owing to the high mobility, limited energy of UAVs, and frequent link breakages, data routing from remote UAVs to a base station may produce retransmissions, loops, energy holes, and long delay. In a UAV swarm network, therefore, relative mobility, path stability, and delay should be jointly taken into consideration to improve routing performance because they are highly coupled with each other. However, they are not properly exploited in the existing literature. To address these issues, in this paper, a Q-learning (QL)-based routing protocol inspired by adaptive flocking control (QRIFC) is proposed. The proposed adaptive flocking control algorithm generates optimal mobility with fairness in travel distance for each UAV to control the optimal node density. It also addresses the trade-off between aerial coverage and quality of service in connectivity by imposing constraints on the minimum separation distance and maximum allowable inter-UAV spacing using two-hop neighbor information. Additionally, it provides a stable link duration (LD) between neighboring UAVs and optimizes the control overhead. Furthermore, QL performs multi-objective optimization by utilizing a new state exploration and exploitation strategy to select an optimal routing path in terms of delay, stable path selection defined by predictive LD, and energy consumption. According to an extensive performance study, the proposed QRIFC outperforms existing routing protocols by 21-40 percent of average end-to-end delay and 9-23 percent of average packet delivery ratio, with less retransmissions. © 2023 Elsevier Inc.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85149734490&doi=10.1016%2fj.vehcom.2023.100572&partnerID=40&md5=f66160ecf38f808589669082ece6ec67,Vehicular Communications,2023
A Non-Optimization-Based Dynamic Path Planning for Autonomous Obstacle Avoidance,"This article presents a non-optimization-based framework for path planning and tracking for evasive maneuvers in autonomous cars. The framework exploits a two-layer approach where a path planner generates a reference trajectory that is then tracked by a path-tracking controller. A nested curvature preview controller (CPC) implements path tracking. In this article, we show how to describe the closed-loop performance of the controller. The quantification of the closed-loop performance in the frequency domain guides the generation of the evasive path. In this way, the algorithm generates a path that avoids the obstacle (if possible) accounting for both static and dynamic constraints. The proposed framework, thus, provides a non-optimization-based way to integrate the characteristics of the path tracker in the path-planner algorithm, thus avoiding the need to define cost functions and use the third-party optimizers. This article validates the proposed evasive maneuver strategy in simulation and on an instrumented vehicle. First, we test the trajectory tracker, showing that it tracks aggressive trajectories (with a lateral acceleration close to 1 g) with an error smaller than 30 cm. Subsequently, we integrate the curvature preview with the path generator and show the joint generation-tracking performance in two different scenarios.  © 1993-2012 IEEE.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85137596855&doi=10.1109%2fTCST.2022.3196880&partnerID=40&md5=83fa2f950ba884f81d0bdd46979c2d32,IEEE Transactions on Control Systems Technology,2023
The Effect of Vehicle Automation Styles on Drivers' Emotional State,"Self-driving vehicles promise many safety, mobility, and environmental benefits. However, users' lack of trust and acceptance may threaten the success and potential of this technology. Monitoring the driver's emotional state is one way to address this challenge. Empathetic automation can respond to the driver's state and improve the experience and acceptance of self-driving vehicle drivers. In this study, 24 participants rode in a self-driving vehicle simulator and experienced three automation styles (aggressive, moderate, conservative) and four intersection types (with and without a stop sign, and with and without traffic.) We identified the observed drivers' emotions from the video data and labeled the video frames using the dimensional and discrete emotion models to examine how automation behavior affects the driver's emotional state. We used multilevel Bayesian linear regression and multilevel Dirichlet regression to model the continuous and discrete emotions, respectively. The automation driving style effect varied for each participant. The same conditions provoked positive responses for some participants, and negative for others. Furthermore, the results showed that intersection type, the position within the intersection, and their interaction affected the driver's emotional state. This indicates that personalized driver state monitoring systems might enhance drivers' experience in self-driving vehicles.  © 2000-2011 IEEE.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85148422145&doi=10.1109%2fTITS.2023.3239880&partnerID=40&md5=062d983006d46633fec77ec1fbdfc6e6,IEEE Transactions on Intelligent Transportation Systems,2023
The OpenCDA Open-Source Ecosystem for Cooperative Driving Automation Research,"Advances in Single-vehicle intelligence of automated driving has encountered great challenges because of limited capabilities in perception and interaction with complex traffic environments. Cooperative Driving Automation (CDA) has been considered a pivotal solution to next-generation automated driving and smart transportation. Though CDA has attracted much attention from both academia and industry, exploration of its potential is still in its infancy. In industry, companies tend to build their in-house data collection pipeline and research tools to tailor their needs and protect intellectual properties. Reinventing the wheels, however, wastes resources and limits the generalizability of the developed approaches since no standardized benchmarks exist. On the other hand, in academia, due to the absence of real-world traffic data and computation resources, researchers often investigate CDA topics in simplified and mostly simulated environments, restricting the possibility of scaling the research outputs to real-world scenarios. Therefore, there is an urgent need to establish an open-source ecosystem (OSE) to address the demands of different communities for CDA research, particularly in the early exploratory research stages, and provide the bridge to ensure an integrated development and testing pipeline that diverse communities can share. In this paper, we introduce the OpenCDA research ecosystem, a unified OSE integrated with a model zoo, a suite of driving simulators at various resolutions, large-scale real-world and simulated datasets, complete development toolkits for benchmark training/testing, and a scenario database/generator. We also demonstrate the effectiveness of OpenCDA OSE through example use cases, including cooperative 3D LiDAR detection, cooperative merge, cooperative camera-based map prediction, and adversarial scenario generation.  © 2016 IEEE.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85149364422&doi=10.1109%2fTIV.2023.3244948&partnerID=40&md5=e5ba976b02deaaeeff1c6e58cf428d46,IEEE Transactions on Intelligent Vehicles,2023
Detecting UAV Presence Using Convolution Feature Vectors in Light Gradient Boosting Machine,"The growing number of Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) applications brings with it, a rising number of privacy concerns. The high availability of commercial drones is also increasing the need for strict regulations. As far away as we are from establishing such protocols to ensure that the most basic human right to privacy is not exploited, we are further away from enforcing them. Thus, there is a need for a generalised drone detection system to detect different drones operating in a broad range of Radio Frequencies (RF). Previous attempts to tackle this problem have been made using audio, video, radar, WiFi and RF signals. While all these methods have their own benefits and drawbacks, RF has various characteristics which make them suitable for practical applications on a large scale. In this paper, we propose a novel technique called the ConvLGBM model which combines the feature extraction capability of a Convolution Neural Network (CNN) with the high classification accuracy of the Light Gradient Boosting Machine (LightGBM). We develop and evaluate the classifications done by an optimal CNN and the LightGBM model and then compare both models with the ConvLGBM.  © 1967-2012 IEEE.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85144756376&doi=10.1109%2fTVT.2022.3227192&partnerID=40&md5=995cdb7e06d5eec5f9b73fe637925894,IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology,2023
Unmanned Aerial Vehicle as Encryption Key Distributor for Secure Communications in Smart Grid,"We use symmetric cryptography for secure communications with resource-limited smart grid control devices. We propose the novel idea of using the unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) as a physical courier to carry secret key bits generated at the control center to remote control devices. While distributing secret keys, the UAV may be attacked in an attempt to sabotage secure communications. The UAV may fly a longer route to avoid attackers but it has a limited onboard battery capacity and must visit each device within a time limit to prevent a secret key deficit. We formulate an optimization to find the lowest attack risk flight route for secret key distribution while taking into consideration key deficiency and battery capacity. Such optimization is NP-hard. We further propose an efficient algorithm to find a low-risk flight route in less than a second, even for a large power grid system with more than a hundred nodes. For large systems, we modify the proposed algorithm to find a low-risk flight route as well as to determine the required UAV flight duration and battery size. Extensive simulation results confirm the superiority of the proposed algorithm against a baseline scheme that is ignorant of attackers.  © 2014 IEEE.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85152908722&doi=10.1109%2fJIOT.2022.3227297&partnerID=40&md5=5aaeeefb1b836b5c51a042ad7de559d2,IEEE Internet of Things Journal,2023
A Triggerless Backdoor Attack and Defense Mechanism for Intelligent Task Offloading in Multi-UAV Systems,"In recent years, multiunmanned aerial vehicular systems (MUAVs) have become prevalent in divergent applications: agriculture, spectrum utilization, transportation, forest fire monitoring, and among others, due to their flexible, robust, and autonomous operational maneuver. Battery-powered multiunmanned aerial vehicles (MUAVs) systems possess limited computation and communication resources, significantly reducing their functional dimension by limiting mission time and range. To address this issue, we propose a federated deep reinforcement learning (FDRL)-based intelligent and decentralized task offloading scheme for resource-constrained UAVs that can enhance the operational capability of the MUAV systems. Moreover, the proposed FDRL scheme can improve offloading policy quality while preserving data privacy in MUAV. However, such intelligent systems may fall prey to backdoor attacks that can intervene in the system's regular operation causing rapid degradation of its performance. We introduce a novel triggerless backdoor attack scheme on intelligent task offloading UAVs and analyze its impact to gauge the resiliency of the offloading policy in the presence of an adversary. Then, we propose lightweight agnostic defense mechanisms to combat such backdoors in multi-UAV settings. The extensive simulation results show that the proposed attack and defense strategies are practical and efficient.  © 2014 IEEE.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85132533980&doi=10.1109%2fJIOT.2022.3172936&partnerID=40&md5=18471c4bee2199e01d85affad60a6821,IEEE Internet of Things Journal,2023
Reconfigurable Wireless Relaying With Multi-UAV-Carried Intelligent Reflecting Surfaces,"Intelligent reflecting surface (IRS) can reconfigure wireless environment to improve channel capacity and extend coverage. In this paper, we develop a reconfigurable wireless relaying system aided by multiple unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV)-carried intelligent reflecting surfaces (IRSs), where both the significant active and passive beamforming gain brought by base station (BS) and IRS and the flexibility of UAV is exploited to enhance multiuser downlink transmission. Specifically, we jointly optimize UAVs' placement, active beamforming and power allocation at the BS, and passive beamforming at the UAV-IRSs to maximize the weighted sum rate. To address the corresponding optimization problem, we decompose it into several subproblems, which are iteratively optimized. Based on simulation results, the proposed scheme achieves significant performance gains over the benchmark schemes.  © 1967-2012 IEEE.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85144751489&doi=10.1109%2fTVT.2022.3227623&partnerID=40&md5=78f9ee51ed269b97ab115d41d712d325,IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology,2023
Traffic Analysis Through Deep-Learning-Based Image Segmentation From UAV Streaming,"Alongside many traditional as well as novel applications, in the latest years, drones have been widely adopted as remote sensing platforms for road traffic monitoring in urban areas and on highways. The problem of traffic monitoring on Region of Interest (RoI) based on drone imagery is a challenging task, especially when the surveillance drone is constantly moving. In this work, two specific subtasks have been addressed. The goal of the first stage is to predict the RoI in drone imagery of traffic scenes using deep-learning (DL)-based approaches instead of traditional image processing; in this connection, the goal of the second task is to perform vehicle detection on the selected RoI. To ensure diversity and robustness, drone images with different altitudes, positions, and view points have been considered. To achieve these goals, two custom aerial data sets for RoI extraction and detection were built by collecting aerial sequences from flying unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) and by transmitting them to the base station leveraging 5G technology. Two different ad hoc DL-based architectures have been designed for the RoI extraction task to maximize the accuracy and inference speed, respectively, and have been evaluated on two different data sets: 1) a custom-built data set and 2) a Massachusetts roads data set. Finally, the models providing the best performance have been combined to further improve the overall results. Experimental tests show that the proposed framework represents a promising solution for drone-based road traffic monitoring in critical areas, exploiting imagery from a variety of viewing angles and altitudes.  © 2014 IEEE.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85142792943&doi=10.1109%2fJIOT.2022.3223283&partnerID=40&md5=7d1582110396aca2b622e00145578033,IEEE Internet of Things Journal,2023
AI-Empowered Trajectory Anomaly Detection and Classification in 6G-V2X,"The immense growth of Autonomous Vehicles (AVs) and networking technologies have paved the way for advanced Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS). AVs increase data demands from in-vehicle users, which pose a significant risk to the vehicular trajectory data and are extremely vulnerable to security threats. It is challenging to describe and detect the trajectory anomalies in urban motion behavior due to the enormous coverage and complexity of ITS in the V2X environment. Most existing systems rely on a restricted number of single detection strategies, such as determining frequent patterns and have limited accuracy in detecting anomalous trajectories. However, they focus only on outlier detection, failing to consider different patterns of anomalous trajectories. This paper proposes Efficient Trajectory Anomaly Detection and Classification (ETADC) framework in a 6G-V2X environment. The proposed ETADC framework employs the Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient algorithm (DDPG) to improve accuracy and efficiency by analyzing multiple strategies, namely driving speed, driving distance, driving direction, and driving time. The result analysis shows that the proposed ETADC technique outperforms the existing systems by 97% accuracy.  © 2000-2011 IEEE.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85137565916&doi=10.1109%2fTITS.2022.3197446&partnerID=40&md5=afb40b5faa792473feab61c1a3b0b0f6,IEEE Transactions on Intelligent Transportation Systems,2023
Autonomous Unwrapping of General Pallets: A Novel Robot for Logistics Exploiting Contact-Based Planning,"In recent years, robotics has been largely applied to improve the efficiency of logistic processes. Pallets cover a crucial role in the logistic flow, since they represent the main way to store and ship items. When put onto pallets, the items are wrapped with plastic films to protect them and prevent them from falling. Despite being the first and necessary operation for handling the stacked goods, unwrapping-the task of removing the plastic films wrapped around the goods-has not yet been satisfactorily automated. We propose the first robotic solution for autonomous unwrapping of generally shaped pallets, including both homogeneous and heterogeneous pallets. Force and torque measurements are exploited to retrieve information on the collisions between the end-effector and the wrapped items or the plastic film. Based on the contact information, we design a novel reactive planning strategy that makes the unwrapping task effective and robust on pallets with uncertain position or shape. We present the results of an extensive experimental campaign to validate the proposed method. Note to Practitioners-This work is motivated by the fact that unwrapping machines are not yet common on the market. The few commercial examples are usually bulky machines that lack the flexibility to adapt to different and irregularly shaped pallets. Thus, the crucial operation of removing the plastic film around palletized goods is still mainly performed by hand. Blade handling, ladders, and electrostatic shocks are sources of potential injury. We propose a flexible, autonomous unwrapping robot suitable for both cuboid and irregularly shaped pallets. The robot is composed of a robotic arm, a custom cutting end-effector, a vision module, and a suitable planning and control unit. The reduced dimensions allow it to be mounted on a mobile base. The robot has been successfully tested on different pallet configurations. However, extensive testing in real-world scenarios should be carried out to assess both reliability and time efficiency in more realistic working conditions. Moreover, real pallets can reach considerable heights. Thus, a prismatic joint should be integrated to address such cases. Finally, unwrapping in the presence of typical plastic straps and different types of film, e.g., the shrink one, is to be evaluated.  © 2004-2012 IEEE.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85133772900&doi=10.1109%2fTASE.2022.3182362&partnerID=40&md5=40f4eb96a8a854bcbad234a93f2aaa5e,IEEE Transactions on Automation Science and Engineering,2023
Dynamic UAV Deployment for Differentiated Services: A Multi-Agent Imitation Learning Based Approach,"Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) have been utilized to serve on-ground users with various services, e.g., computing, communication and caching, due to their mobility and flexibility. The main focus of many recent studies on UAVs is to deploy a set of homogeneous UAVs with identical capabilities controlled by one UAV owner/company to provide services. However, little attention has been paid to the issue of how to enable different UAV owners to provide services with differentiated service capabilities in a shared area. To address this issue, we propose a multi-agent imitation learning enabled UAV deployment approach to maximize both profits of UAV owners and utilities of on-ground users. Specially, a Markov game is formulated among UAV owners and we prove that a Nash equilibrium exists based on the full knowledge of the system. For online scheduling with incomplete information, we design agent policies by imitating the behaviors of corresponding experts. A novel neural network model, integrating convolutional neural networks, generative adversarial networks and a gradient-based policy, can be trained and executed in a fully decentralized manner with a guaranteed ϵ-Nash equilibrium. Performance results show that our algorithm has significant superiority in terms of average profits, utilities and execution time compared with other representative algorithms.  © 2002-2012 IEEE.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85118673567&doi=10.1109%2fTMC.2021.3116236&partnerID=40&md5=fac2c3fca5f55ddbcaea08aaeaaf574b,IEEE Transactions on Mobile Computing,2023
D2D-MAP: A Drone to Drone Authentication Protocol Using Physical Unclonable Functions,"With the continuous miniaturization of electronic devices and the recent advancements in wireless communication technologies, Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs), in general, and Small Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (SUAVs, a.k.a., drones), in particular, are becoming progressively used by the civilian sector within the context of a variety of applications, bringing great convenience to the public. However, due to their resource-constrained nature, risky environmental application, and wireless way of communication, drones are not immune from cyberthreats. As a consequence, the security of drones (SUAVs) has recently gained significant attention by the research community. In particular, when it comes to inter-drone communication. Although traditional cryptographic techniques may provide a certain level of security, they actually constitute a heavy burden on SUAVs due to their resource-constrained nature. In the light of enforcing the security of inter-drone communications, this paper proposes a lightweight drone-to-drone authentication protocol, called D2D-MAP, that uses PUF (Physical Unclonable Function) technology. We design the protocol and evaluate its resilience against various attacks. We use resource-constrained hardware to implement the authentication protocol and perform an evaluation of its performance. We show that the protocol's security and the obtained performance are prominent compared to state-of-the-art authentication protocols, and that they conform to SUAVs security and performance requirements.  © 1967-2012 IEEE.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85144011346&doi=10.1109%2fTVT.2022.3224611&partnerID=40&md5=459d48160edb0c4911a910a294b5679e,IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology,2023
An Accurate UAV 3-D Path Planning Method for Disaster Emergency Response Based on an Improved Multiobjective Swarm Intelligence Algorithm,"Planning a practical three-dimensional (3-D) flight path for unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) is a key challenge for the follow-up management and decision making in disaster emergency response. The ideal flight path is expected to balance the total flight path length and the terrain threat, to shorten the flight time and reduce the possibility of collision. However, in the traditional methods, the tradeoff between these concerns is difficult to achieve, and practical constraints are lacking in the optimized objective functions, which leads to inaccurate modeling. In addition, the traditional methods based on gradient optimization lack an accurate optimization capability in the complex multimodal objective space, resulting in a nonoptimal path. Thus, in this article, an accurate UAV 3-D path planning approach in accordance with an enhanced multiobjective swarm intelligence algorithm is proposed (APPMS). In the APPMS method, the path planning mission is converted into a multiobjective optimization task with multiple constraints, and the objectives based on the total flight path length and degree of terrain threat are simultaneously optimized. In addition, to obtain the optimal UAV 3-D flight path, an accurate swarm intelligence search approach based on improved ant colony optimization is introduced, which can improve the global and local search capabilities by using the preferred search direction and random neighborhood search mechanism. The effectiveness of the proposed APPMS method was demonstrated in three groups of simulated experiments with different degrees of terrain threat, and a real-data experiment with 3-D terrain data from an actual emergency situation.  © 2013 IEEE.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85130809097&doi=10.1109%2fTCYB.2022.3170580&partnerID=40&md5=b629feb29dcb69562b805bb5a9f3c5ae,IEEE Transactions on Cybernetics,2023
LiDAR-camera fusion: Dual transformer enhancement for 3D object detection,"Recently, the progress in autonomous driving tries to leverage the strong complementarity of LiDAR point clouds and RGB images to realize a high-efficient 3D object detection task. However, some works just simply decorate the raw point clouds or point-cloud features with camera clues in a hard way, which cannot fully exploit the relevance between the two-modal data. In this paper, we propose a dual-feature interaction module that adopts a soft-fusion strategy to give guidance for the LiDAR-camera feature fusion by interacting the LiDAR and camera features with Transformer. Compared with the hard-fusion method, this soft-fusion method can decorate the LiDAR feature with a reliable image feature. Additionally, we design an uncertainty-based 3D Intersection over Union (IoU) metric in the training process. This strategy aims at modeling the unreliability of 3D IoU scores to alleviate the bad effects caused by the coupling problem of 3D properties. Experiments conducted on the KITTI dataset achieve significant improvements in the 3D object detection and bird's eye view tasks when compared with the previous arts.

Multi-AUG three-dimensional path planning and secure cooperative path following under DoS attacks,"This article is concerned with the design of a three-dimensional path planning and secure event-triggered cooperative path following for multiple disk-type autonomous underwater gliders (AUGs) in the presence of underwater obstacles and denial-of service (DoS) attacks. A three-dimensional collision-free path planning method is firstly proposed by using a quantum-behaved adaptive particle swarm optimization method in the global path planning layer and an artificial potential field method in the local path planning layer. Secondly, a path variable update law is devised based on a three-dimensional line-of-sight guidance mechanism, which can achieve the cooperative control for networked AUGs, in addition, AUGs can stop at the target points automatically. Finally, an event-triggered mechanism is presented to achieve secure cooperative control for AUGs under the unreliable network environment in the presence of DoS attacks. The stability is validated based on the input-to-state stability theory. Simulation results and numerical analysis demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed integrated three-dimensional collision-free path planning and secure event-triggered cooperative path following method. © 2023 Elsevier Ltd",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85149305253&doi=10.1016%2fj.oceaneng.2023.113864&partnerID=40&md5=b90c1eb2a493b80ac9c5fb29b6b5b7d4,Ocean Engineering,2023
Autonomous Vehicles Security: Challenges and Solutions Using Blockchain and Artificial Intelligence,"The arrival of autonomous vehicles (AVs) promises many great benefits, including increased safety and reduced energy consumption, pollution, and congestion. However, these engines have many security and privacy issues that could undermine the expected benefits if not addressed. AVs will provide new opportunities for hackers to carry out malicious attacks, posing a great threat to the future of mobility and data protection. The research trend in this field indicates that combining Blockchain and AI could bring strong protection for AVs against malicious attacks. Blockchain and AI have different working paradigms, but when merged, they can empower each other, and solve many security and privacy issues of AVs. AI can optimise the construction of the Blockchain to make it more efficient, secure and energy-saving, where Blockchain provides data immutability and trust mechanism for AI-based solutions and makes them more transparent, trustful, and explainable. Although some research is being conducted on this area, the topic of applying Blockchain and AI for securing AVs is not deeply investigated. In this paper, we explore the possible application of an amalgamation of Blockchain and AI solutions for securing AVs. We first introduce a classification of security and privacy threats that may arise from the application of AVs. Then, we provide an overview of recent literature regarding Blockchain and AI usage for securing AVs. Finally, we highlight limitations and challenges that may face the integration of Blockchain and AI with AVs based on our systemic review and suggest potential future directions for research in this field.  © 2000-2011 IEEE.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85147277493&doi=10.1109%2fTITS.2023.3236274&partnerID=40&md5=371387d375b7428a610aefe68d629479,IEEE Transactions on Intelligent Transportation Systems,2023
A novel UAV path planning approach: Heuristic crossing search and rescue optimization algorithm,"Unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) path planning plays an important role in the flight process of an UAV, which needs an effective algorithm to deal with UAV path planning problem. The search and rescue optimization algorithm (SAR) is easy to implement and has the characteristics of flexible, but it has slow convergence speed and has not been applied to UAV path planning. To address these problems, a heuristic crossing search and rescue optimization algorithm (HC-SAR) is proposed. HC-SAR combines a heuristic crossover strategy with the basic SAR to improve the convergence speed and maintain the population diversity in the optimization process. Furthermore, a real-time path adjustment strategy is proposed to straighten the UAV flight path. In addition, cubic B-spline interpolation is used to smooth the generated path. Comprehensive experiments including two-dimensional and three-dimensional environments for different threat zone are conducted to validate the performance of HC-SAR. The results show that HC-SAR has a high convergence speed and can successfully obtain a safe and efficient path, and it significantly outperforms SAR, differential evolution (DE), ant lion optimizer (ALO), squirrel search algorithm (SSA) and salp swarm algorithm (SSA) in all the cases. These results suggest that the proposed algorithm can effectively serve as an alternative for solving UAV path planning problem. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85143497561&doi=10.1016%2fj.eswa.2022.119243&partnerID=40&md5=3b61ac67a8fcad5d0785ebe44dfef2bf,Expert Systems with Applications,2023
Fuzzy-Model-Based Lateral Control for Networked Autonomous Vehicle Systems under Hybrid Cyber-Attacks,"This article addresses the problem of lateral control problem for networked-based autonomous vehicle systems. A novel solution is presented for nonlinear autonomous vehicles to smoothly follow the planned path under external disturbances and network-induced issues, such as cyber-attacks, time delays, and limited bandwidths. First, a fuzzy-model-based system is established to represent the nonlinear networked vehicle systems subject to hybrid cyber-attacks. To reduce the network burden and effects of cyber-attacks, an asynchronous resilient event-triggered scheme (ETS) is proposed. A dynamic output-feedback control method is developed to address the underlying problem. Conditions are derived to obtain the output-feedback controller and resilient asynchronous ETS such that the closed-loop switched fuzzy system is globally exponentially stable. Examples are provided to demonstrate the effectiveness and merits of the proposed new control design techniques.  © 2013 IEEE.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85126517092&doi=10.1109%2fTCYB.2022.3151880&partnerID=40&md5=54e6fc129f420db3446955657af1f019,IEEE Transactions on Cybernetics,2023
Federated Imitation Learning for UAV Swarm Coordination in Urban Traffic Monitoring,"The popularization of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) has boosted various civil applications such as traffic monitoring, in which the effective coordination of the UAV swarm plays a significant role in expanding the monitoring range and enhancing the execution efficiency. However, due to the isolated local environments as well as the heterogeneous execution capabilities, it is challenging to achieve highly consistent actions. In this article, we incorporate the federated learning framework with the imitation learning technique to coordinate the UAVs' maneuvers by interactively imitating the leader UAV's operations. During the interagent global model download phase, we utilize the generative adversarial imitation learning (GAIL) model to accurately follow the leader UAV's operations by removing the biased estimates of imitation parameters. While in the intraagent local model training phase, we utilize the self-imitation learning (SIL) model to correct delicate imitation errors by virtue of the follower UAVs' own historical valuable experiences. In order to achieve more efficient distributed parameter interactions, we regularize the federated gradient updates and eventually yield coordinated swarm policies. We evaluate the proposed algorithm in the UAV-based traffic monitoring scenario. Evaluation results demonstrate the superiorities on training and execution efficiencies.  © 2005-2012 IEEE.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85135225448&doi=10.1109%2fTII.2022.3192675&partnerID=40&md5=ee272a338dedb71881c21d2c3d806d64,IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics,2023
Robust Image-Based Landing Control of a Quadrotor on an Unpredictable Moving Vehicle Using Circle Features,"This paper addresses the landing problem of a quadrotor on an unpredictable moving vehicle, using a robust image-based visual servoing (IBVS) method. The circle-based image moments are defined to construct image dynamics, and the passivity-like property of the circle features is preserved by reprojecting to the virtual image plane. The landing control system is decoupled into translation and rotation modules due to the rotation invariance of the proposed circle features. First, by exploiting the error transformation in the image space, a robust IBVS controller can overcome the lack of both the desired depth information of target features and the velocity feedback of the target. Next, an adaptive geometric attitude controller is developed directly using rotation matrices to avoid the singularities of Euler-Angles and the ambiguity of quaternions. One benefit of the proposed scheme is that it can potentially improve the camera visibility, guarantee the transient and steady-state behaviors in image space, and be efficiently implemented on the low-cost quadrotor. Finally, The stability analysis is presented using Lyapunov stability theory on cascaded systems, and the effectiveness of the proposed control strategy is demonstrated through simulations and experiments. Note to Practitioners-The motivation of this paper is to investigate a practical control strategy for the image-based landing control of underactuated quadrotors on an unpredictable moving vehicle. In most of the existing image-based landing control schemes for underactuated quadrotors, having the prior predictive model of the moving landing vehicle to provide a feed-forward compensation during the landing maneuver. However, due to the fact that the landing environment and vehicle are primarily stochastic, resulting in no predictive models are valid in practice. Therefore, this paper suggests a robust image-based landing control strategy without the model or state of the moving landing vehicle. In particular, a novel virtual circle feature, possessing the characteristic of rotation invariance, is designed for the landing of underactuated quadrotors, which decouples the landing system and simplifies the control design. Moreover, the image feature errors are directly retained within prescribed performance funnels in the image space. As a result, the transient and steady-state landing behaviors can be implicitly guaranteed in Cartesian space. The stability and convergence of the system are analyzed mathematically and the experiment using quadrotors provides promising results. In ongoing research, we are addressing the issues of collision avoidances and unknown disturbances to provide a more realistic setup for the autonomous deployment and recovery of underactuated quadrotors in GPS-denied environments.  © 2004-2012 IEEE.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85131836345&doi=10.1109%2fTASE.2022.3180506&partnerID=40&md5=f8bde676241b5d7e6c0ab2c1a0822822,IEEE Transactions on Automation Science and Engineering,2023
Active Reconfigurable Intelligent Surface-Assisted MISO Integrated Sensing and Communication Systems for Secure Operation,"Spectrum congestion has motivated the recent introduction of integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) systems where radar and communications functionalities co-exist and share the same spectrum. This is accompanied by extensive research in the area of reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (RIS), thanks to their ability to improve the ISAC systems. In this paper, the physical layer security of a multiuser multiple-input single-output (MU-MISO) ISAC system is investigated when the system is subject to eavesdropping by a malicious unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV). In particular, we propose using an active RIS to maximize the achievable secrecy rate of the system through jointly designing the radar receive beamformers, the active RIS reflection coefficients matrix and the transmit beamformers at the dual-function base station of the ISAC system. This is done while taking into account a minimum radar detection signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) and total system power budget constraints. The resulting non-convex optimization problem is tackled by exploiting fractional programming (FP) and majorization-minimization (MM) techniques to achieve a solution. Our numerical results show the superiority of active RIS to achieve the goal when compared with passive RIS or with an ISAC without an RIS. Results also show that passive RIS could still be a viable solution to achieve this goal but at the expense of a much larger needed size especially when lower power budgets are available.  © 1967-2012 IEEE.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85144783383&doi=10.1109%2fTVT.2022.3227319&partnerID=40&md5=a78ded9c9cf1037fe64c6d7a62125c8f,IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology,2023
Autonomous Underwater Environment Perceiving and Modeling: An Experimental Campaign With FeelHippo AUV for Forward Looking Sonar-Based Automatic Target Recognition and Data Association,"Seabed inspection is one of the most sought-after applications for autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs). Acoustical sensors, such as side-scan sonars and forward-looking sonars (FLSs), are commonly favored over optical cameras to carry out such a task. Indeed, sonars are not influenced by illumination conditions and can provide high-range data. However, due to the lack of features and low resolution, acoustical images are often hard to interpret with conventional automatic techniques, forcing human operators to analyze thousands of collected images to identify the so-called objects of potential interest (OPIs). In this article, we report the development of an automatic target recognition (ATR) methodology to identify and localize OPIs in FLS imagery. Such detections have been then exploited to realize a virtual world model with the probabilistic multiple hypothesis anchoring data association and model tracking algorithm. Distinct models of convolutional neural networks have been trained with a data set acquired in May 2019 at the Naval Support and Experimentation Centre (Centro di Supporto e Sperimentazione Navale - CSSN) basin in La Spezia, Italy. The ATR strategy has been successfully validated offline with the data gathered in October 2019 in the same site where the seabed targets were replaced and relocated. As regards the world modeling technique, it has been preliminarily tested on a simulated scenario built upon unmanned underwater vehicle Simulator. Finally, both the ATR and world modeling systems were on-field tested in October 2020 at the CSSN basin in a multivehicle architecture by employing an acoustical channel between FeelHippo AUV and an autonomous moving buoy.  © 1976-2012 IEEE.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85142771255&doi=10.1109%2fJOE.2022.3209719&partnerID=40&md5=49862702862b9d680694408336eb71e7,IEEE Journal of Oceanic Engineering,2023
Zonotopic resilient state estimation for unmanned surface vehicles subject to integrity attacks,"This work concerns the problem of resilient state estimation for unmanned surface vehicle systems subject to integrity attacks under peak-bounded perturbations. A novel resilient remote state estimation method is proposed based on zonotopic reachability analysis. The compromised sensors are identified based on the so-called predicted output set and zonotope support strip. Then, a resilient state reachable set is obtained by using the sensor data from the remaining benign measurements. For enhancing the performance of estimation, segment minimization is introduced to optimize the obtained state reachable set.

A Multiagent Mission Coordination System for Continuous Situational Awareness of Bushfires,"This paper devises a multi-Agent Mission Coordinating Architecture (MCA) to achieve continuous situational awareness (SA) in bushfires, which can help with quick detection and accurate response to the hazards. In this paper, we use Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) as instantiations of physical agents. MCA is a scalable architecture and aims to provide the UAVs with parallel mission plans, adopting a fire spread probability map and the Fuzzy C-means method to avoid mission overlap and duplicate information. The architecture is then enhanced by integrating a synchronized communication framework to facilitate UAVs' adaptive cooperation and total flight time optimization. Furthermore, integrating the communication framework minimizes the number of deployed UAVs to fully cover the same area, saving considerable cost and energy compared to the Parallel Mode. The scalability challenge of the Parallel Mode, determining the required number of UAVs to cover the entire area, and the efficiency of the mission planning algorithm are thoroughly investigated and compared to the performance of the Communication Mode. Finally, the simulation results prove the MCA's effectiveness in enhancing the UAVs' exploration capability, resulting in comprehensive monitoring of all affected areas. Note to Practitioners-The proposed architecture in this research could offer flexibility to increase the number of UAVs on demand without requiring a change and adjustment of the parameters. Furthermore, a synchronized communication framework enhances MCA, enabling all UAVs to share their resources and exploit residual battery time to assist each other, manage the overall operation time, and reduce the total operation cost.  © 2004-2012 IEEE.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85133781827&doi=10.1109%2fTASE.2022.3183233&partnerID=40&md5=872123bb97f0ae62e19d1aecc5328396,IEEE Transactions on Automation Science and Engineering,2023
Dynamic Reallocation Model of Multiple Unmanned Aerial Vehicle Tasks in Emergent Adjustment Scenarios,"Due to their strong risk tolerance, low manufacturing cost, and good maneuverability, unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) have been widely used in various fields. Among related challenges, coordinated task assignment is a key scientific issue for autonomous control of UAVs. In this article, based on the idea of fuzzy C-means clustering and the ant colony optimization algorithm, a cooperative multiple task reallocation problem with target precedence constraints for heterogeneous UAVs is proposed. The contributions of this research are the performance evaluation of the original algorithms in a dynamic context, consideration of changes in some attributes of the environment, and the extension of these algorithms to properly address more realistic dynamic emergent adjustment scenarios. According to the corresponding task reallocation strategy, the scenarios are divided into three categories: the complete redistribution strategy can effectively cope with scenarios where tasks have changed significantly, the partial adjustment strategy can induce partial responses to the changes of individual tasks, and group redistribution can effectively solve the problem of task target threat rating changes. The simulation results show that the dynamic reallocation model of multi-UAV tasks in dynamic emergent adjustment scenarios can achieve better performance to complete the corresponding tasks based on the proposed scheme. In addition, we deployed the developed graphical modeling and analysis software platform to implement the dynamic reallocation model of multi-UAV tasks in dynamic emergent scenarios, and the validity and reliability of the proposed task reallocation model were verified.  © 1965-2011 IEEE.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85135743752&doi=10.1109%2fTAES.2022.3195478&partnerID=40&md5=f1e8440cd65cc6298161821d5450fcd8,IEEE Transactions on Aerospace and Electronic Systems,2023
Pursuit-evasion game strategy of USV based on deep reinforcement learning in complex multi-obstacle environment,"Aiming at the confrontation game problems between pursuit-evasion unmanned surface vehicles under complex multi-obstacle environment, a pursuit-evasion game strategy is proposed. Firstly, the multi-obstacle environment is set up, and the gaming situation can be judged by the perception between pursuit-evasion USVs. For the pursuers, the model training is performed based on multi-agent deep reinforcement learning, so that they can quickly plan a reasonable obstacle avoidance and pursuit route, and form an effective encirclement posture before the evader approaches the target point. Meanwhile, the credit assignment problem among the members of the pursuing group is considered. For the evader, deep reinforcement learning is combined with imitation learning to train the escape model, so that it can reach the preset point in as short a time as possible and avoid the obstacles on the way. Finally, an adversarial-evolutionary game training method under multiple random scenarios is designed and combined with curriculum learning to iteratively update the pursuit and escape models. Through the detailed comparative analysis of the model training process and simulation experiments, it is proved that the proposed two types of models have higher convergence efficiency and stability, and they can have higher intelligence to pursue, escape and avoid obstacles respectively. © 2023 Elsevier Ltd",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85149063181&doi=10.1016%2fj.oceaneng.2023.114016&partnerID=40&md5=80d3e74a09dbaa57109e1ef089042fb7,Ocean Engineering,2023
Towards UAV-Based MEC Service Chain Resilience Evaluation: A Quantitative Modeling Approach,"Unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) and network function virtualization (NFV) facilitate the deployment of multi-access edge computing (MEC). In the UAV-based MEC (UMEC) network, virtualized network function (VNF) can be implemented as a lightweight container running on UMEC host operating system (OS). However, UMEC network is vulnerable to attack, which can result in resource degradation and even UMEC service disruption. Rejuvenation techniques, such as failover technique and live container migration technique, can mitigate the impact of resource degradation but their effectiveness to improve the resilience of UMEC services should be evaluated. This paper presents a quantitative modeling approach based on semi-Markov process to investigate the resilience of a UMEC service chain consisting of any number of VNFs executed in any number of UMEC hosts in terms of availability and reliability. Unlike existing studies, the semi-Markov model constructed in this paper can capture the time-dependent behaviors between VNFs, between host OSes, and between VNFs and host OSes on the condition that the holding times of the recovery and failure events follow any kind of distribution. We perform the sensitivity analysis to identify potential resilience bottlenecks. The results highlight that migration time is the parameter significantly affecting the resilience, which shed the insight on designing the UMEC service chain with high-grade resilience requirements. In addition, we carry out the numerical experiments to reveal that: (i) the type of failure time distribution has a significant effect on the resilience; and (ii) the resilience increases with decreasing number of VNFs, while the availability increases with increasing number of UMEC hosts and the reliability decreases with increasing number of UMEC hosts, which can provide meaningful guidance for the UAV placement optimization in the UMEC network.  © 1967-2012 IEEE.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85148422858&doi=10.1109%2fTVT.2022.3225564&partnerID=40&md5=edc40e63d1dba3e2be80a784557f2e63,IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology,2023
Robust Decision Making for Autonomous Vehicles at Highway On-Ramps: A Constrained Adversarial Reinforcement Learning Approach,"Reinforcement learning has demonstrated its potential in a series of challenging domains. However, many real-world decision making tasks involve unpredictable environmental changes or unavoidable perception errors that are often enough to mislead an agent into making suboptimal decisions and even cause catastrophic failures. In light of these potential risks, reinforcement learning with application in safety-critical autonomous driving domain remains tricky without ensuring robustness against environmental uncertainties (e.g., road adhesion changes or measurement noises). Therefore, this paper proposes a novel constrained adversarial reinforcement learning approach for robust decision making of autonomous vehicles at highway on-ramps. Environmental disturbance is modelled as an adversarial agent that can learn an optimal adversarial policy to thwart the autonomous driving agent. Meanwhile, observation perturbation is approximated to maximize the variation of the perturbed policy through a white-box adversarial attack technique. Furthermore, a constrained adversarial actor-critic algorithm is presented to optimize an on-ramp merging policy while keeping the variations of the attacked driving policy and action-value function within bounds. Finally, the proposed robust highway on-ramp merging decision making method of autonomous vehicles is evaluated in three stochastic mixed traffic flows with different densities, and its effectiveness is demonstrated in comparison with the competitive baselines.  © 2000-2011 IEEE.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85146241076&doi=10.1109%2fTITS.2022.3229518&partnerID=40&md5=941f16286d0bffab51abe29c29f160d6,IEEE Transactions on Intelligent Transportation Systems,2023
Robust Certificateless Authentication Protocol for the SAE J1939 Commercial Vehicles Bus,"Authentication for controller area network (CAN) buses in an intra-vehicular network involving electronic control units (ECUs) is a challenging factor. The Society of Automotive Engineers standard (SAE J1939) incorporating the ISO 11898-1 specification for the data link and physical layers of the standard CAN and CAN-flexible data rate (CAN-FD) handles communication among ECUs. The SAE J1939 is vulnerable to replay, masquerading and machine-in-the-middle (MITM) attacks. To prevent such attacks, there exist protocol suites for resource-constrained and resource-unconstrained nodes proposed in the literature which are not formally analysed. We formally analyse one of the comprehensive protocol suites using the state-of-the-art Tamarin automated validation tool. To mitigate the identified attacks, we propose two new authentication protocols. At first, we propose one pass authentication protocol for computationally restricted nodes. For nodes that are not restricted computationally, we present a certificateless signature-based authentication protocol. Additionally, we present a new certificateless key insulated manageable signature (CL-KIMS) scheme for signature-based authentication protocol. CL-KIMS ensures key insulation and random access key update properties, and assures self-healing property. The security of the proposed protocol suite and signature scheme is formally analysed using the random oracle model (ROM). Especially, CL-KIMS scheme is provably secure in the ROM against Type-I and Type-II adversaries. A detailed performance comparison and simulation study show that the proposed protocol suite has lesser communication overhead and ensures robust security as compared to the existing protocol suites.  © 1967-2012 IEEE.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85144810353&doi=10.1109%2fTVT.2022.3227281&partnerID=40&md5=5e4dbc874bb06c64dd402c36fe537c97,IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology,2023
Aerial Surveillance in Cities: When UAVs Take Public Transportation Vehicles,"This paper considers using unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) to survey important sites across a city. When the sites are relatively far from the UAVs' depot, the UAVs may not be able to reach many of the sites. Suppose that a UAV can take public transportation vehicles (PTVs) like a passenger. Then, it may reach a site that is unreachable by flying only. Based on this UAV-PTV scheme, we investigate a task-UAV assignment problem, which assigns a set of surveillance tasks to UAVs. We formulate a mixed-integer linear programming (MILP) problem that minimizes the overall energy consumption of UAVs, subject to that every site is surveyed by a certain number of UAVs during a given time window, and all UAVs successfully return to the depot. Considering that this problem is NP-hard, we present two sub-optimal solutions. The first solution orders the surveillance tasks according to the starting times of their time windows. Then, starting from the earliest one, it assigns the tasks one by one to UAVs. The second solution breaks the tasks into small non-overlapping groups. It then assigns tasks to UAVs group by group. The former solution quickly addresses the assignment problem, but it lacks the overall management of UAV resources. The latter improves this by assigning a group of tasks simultaneously, and it can control the computation complexity by limiting the group size. The comparison with the brute force method shows that the proposed solutions can achieve competitive performance in a reasonable time. Note to Practitioners-Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) have been widely used in surveillance missions. However, one challenge practitioners often meet is the limited flight duration. Commercial UAVs are in general powered by the onboard battery. Due to the restriction of payload, the battery capacity is constrained, which limits the UAVs' operation time. In this paper, we present the approach exploiting public transportation vehicles (PTVs). In our design, a UAV can take a public transportation vehicles such as buses, trams and trains on the roof and transfer between vehicles when necessary. With this UAV-PTV collaboration scheme, we consider how to efficiently assign surveillance tasks to UAVs. Due to the NP-hardness of the considered problem, two suboptimal algorithms are presented.  © 2004-2012 IEEE.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85132721940&doi=10.1109%2fTASE.2022.3182057&partnerID=40&md5=b86608d16af2c175fa54fd525ff18b9e,IEEE Transactions on Automation Science and Engineering,2023
GNSS Spoofer Localization for Vehicles Based on Doppler and Clock Drift Double Difference,"With the development of vehicle navigation, autonomous driving and unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV), increasing spoofing attacks of global navigation satellite systems (GNSS) have emerged towards vehicles, which can mislead users by false position, velocity and time (PVT) solutions, resulting in serious consequences. Spoofer localization is a necessary step to fundamentally address the spoofing attacks. Most of the conventional spoofer localization methods are based on time of arrival (TOA) or time difference of arrival (TDOA), where time synchronization is indispensable and therefore is hard to apply to the existing vehicles equipped with independent commercial receivers. To cope with this problem, in this paper we develop a flexible method for vehicles to locate a stationary spoofer based on Doppler and clock drift double difference (DCDD). DCDD is calculated using Doppler measurements and clock drift solutions of one vehicular receiver and another reference receiver. Generally, Doppler frequency of GNSS signals changes slowly with time, which releases the restriction for high-precision time synchronization. DCDD represents the Doppler frequency caused by the vehicle motion, from which the spoofer position can be estimated. Utilizing DCDD, an iterative weighted least squares (WLS) algorithm is used to solve the spoofer position, and a closed-form initial value is given to improve the convergence rate. We evaluate the localization performance by the derived Cramér-Rao lower bound (CRLB) in the presence of vehicle position and velocity errors. Simulations and field vehicle experiments are conducted to verify the feasibility and effective of the proposed method.  © 1967-2012 IEEE.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85144766313&doi=10.1109%2fTVT.2022.3226528&partnerID=40&md5=e04ba3da41fdf02c44321b48d1684cff,IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology,2023
AI-Empowered Speed Extraction via Port-Like Videos for Vehicular Trajectory Analysis,"Automated container terminal (ACT) is considered as port industry development direction, and accurate kinematic data (speed, volume, etc.) is essential for enhancing ACT operation efficiency and safety. Port surveillance videos provide much useful spatial-temporal information with advantages of easy obtainable, large spatial coverage, etc. In that way, it is of great importance to analyze automated guided vehicle (AGV) trajectory movement from port surveillance videos. Motivated by the newly emerging computer vision and artificial intelligence (AI) techniques, we propose an ensemble framework for extracting vehicle speeds from port-like surveillance videos for the purpose of analyzing AGV moving trajectory. Firstly, the framework exploits vehicle position in each image via a feature-enhanced scale-aware descriptor. Secondly, we match vehicle position and trajectory data from the previous step output via Kalman filter and Hungarian algorithm, and thus we obtain the vehicular imaging trajectory in a frame-by-frame manner. Thirdly, we estimate the vehicular moving speed in real-world via the help of perspective projection theory. The experimental results suggest that our proposed framework can obtain accurate vehicle kinematic data under typical port traffic scenarios considering that the average measurement error of root mean square deviation is 0.675 km/h, the mean absolute deviation is 0.542 km/h, and the Pearson correlation coefficient is 0.9349. The research findings suggest that cutting-edge AI and computer vision techniques can accurately extract on-site vehicular trajectory related data from port videos, and thus help port traffic participants make more reasonable management decisions.  © 2000-2011 IEEE.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85129428834&doi=10.1109%2fTITS.2022.3167650&partnerID=40&md5=faccbe0540c8bb1ecf5e89983f3fe9e3,IEEE Transactions on Intelligent Transportation Systems,2023
Mind the Gap! A Study on the Transferability of Virtual Versus Physical-World Testing of Autonomous Driving Systems,"Safe deployment of self-driving cars (SDC) necessitates thorough simulated and in-field testing. Most testing techniques consider virtualized SDCs within a simulation environment, whereas less effort has been directed towards assessing whether such techniques transfer to and are effective with a physical real-world vehicle. In this paper, we shed light on the problem of generalizing testing results obtained in a driving simulator to a physical platform and provide a characterization and quantification of the sim2real gap affecting SDC testing. In our empirical study, we compare SDC testing when deployed on a physical small-scale vehicle versus its digital twin. Due to the unavailability of driving quality indicators from the physical platform, we use neural rendering to estimate them through visual odometry, hence allowing full comparability with the digital twin. Then, we investigate the transferability of behavior and failure exposure between virtual and real-world environments, targeting both unintended abnormal test data and intended adversarial examples. Our study shows that, despite the usage of a faithful digital twin, there are still critical shortcomings that contribute to the reality gap between the virtual and physical world, threatening existing testing solutions that only consider virtual SDCs. On the positive side, our results present the test configurations for which physical testing can be avoided, either because their outcome does transfer between virtual and physical environments, or because the uncertainty profiles in the simulator can help predict their outcome in the real world.  © 1976-2012 IEEE.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85137585337&doi=10.1109%2fTSE.2022.3202311&partnerID=40&md5=0e58bbbbb04409ce8cb68f48780fa8f3,IEEE Transactions on Software Engineering,2023
A hybrid algorithm based on grey wolf optimizer and differential evolution for UAV path planning,"Autonomous navigation is significant to UAVs, especially in disaster scenarios. A Hybrid GWO and Differential Evolution (HGWODE) algorithm is developed to solve UAV path planning. In HGWODE, GWO and DE algorithms cooperate well to balance exploitation and exploration. The position-updated equation of GWO is improved, which makes alpha, beta, and delta wolves search around the alpha wolf, and omega wolves search around the top three wolves to boost the exploitation. A rank-based mutation strategy is implemented in DE algorithm to promote exploitation while maintaining the exploration capacity. We test HGWODE on CEC 2014 and UAV path planning. The proposed HGWODE is superior to GWO and several GWO variants when solving test functions and UAV path planning models. UAV path from HGWODE is smoother and shorter than its rivals. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85143494433&doi=10.1016%2fj.eswa.2022.119327&partnerID=40&md5=de9153caa6da0fc86174c2243d9d12ac,Expert Systems with Applications,2023
Reinforcement learning for energy efficiency improvement in UAV-BS access networks: A knowledge transfer scheme,"Recently the possibility of forming unmanned aerial vehicle base station (UAV-BS) network systems with energy harvesting capabilities to support persistent wireless access services for pedestrian users has been validated. Due to the need of sustaining wireless access services of the UAV-BSs, we investigate an optimal policy to maximize the overall energy utilization efficiency (renewable energy) of the UAV-BSs during their active in-flight network access operations. Since the natural sources of renewable energy (e.g., solar energy or wind energy harvesting) have stochastic properties with respect to the arrival rate of the dynamics of the unknown environment, we exploit an actor–critic reinforcement learning framework, which considers the continuous-valued states and action space for learning the best policy during interaction with the environment. To enhance and expedite the learning process, a transfer asynchronous advantage actor–critic (TA3C) algorithm is proposed, which enables UAV-BSs to transfer (i.e., share) knowledge gained in historical periods, during parallel task asynchronous executions on multiple instances of the environment. Numerical results reveal that the proposed TA3C algorithm surpasses the classic A3C and A2C algorithms in terms of throughput and optimal energy utilization efficiency. © 2023 Elsevier Ltd",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85147193258&doi=10.1016%2fj.engappai.2023.105930&partnerID=40&md5=acd1698f64551234f90196294900e96a,Engineering Applications of Artificial Intelligence,2023
An Optimal Layout Pattern-Based Solution Approach to the Extended Machine Layout Problem with Multirow Multicolumn Structure,"The machine layout problem (MLP) is to determine the optimal location arrangement of machines in a production system, usually in order to minimize the total material transmission distance. This article considers a type of MLP in an automated manufacturing system with unequal-Area machines, machine replicas, and taking multi-row multi-column layout structure. The aim is to determine the near-optimal machine layout and orbit layout simultaneously. We model the problem as a mixed-integer linear program by introducing the concept of orbit-based relative locations and using auxiliary binary variables, including relative location assignment variables, in-block relationship variables, and material routing variables. We further exploit the optimal layout patterns, based on which, when the relative locations of the machines and orbits are given, we can quickly derive the near-optimal absolute machine and orbit positions without solving a mixed-integer linear program. A two-layer hybrid heuristic method is proposed to solve the problem: The outer layer is a variable neighborhood search metaheuristic used to explore the solution space of the relative locations, while the inner layer is a recursive heuristic based on the optimal layout patterns. Experiments on instances of different sizes are conducted, and the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed algorithms are verified. Note to Practitioners-Many manufacturing systems, for example, those in the semiconductor industry, use automated guided vehicles running on orbits to transfer materials between machines. The design of such a manufacturing system consists of determining the numbers of vertical and horizontal orbits, their positions, and the positions of all machines. It is not unusual for there to be hundreds of machines. Furthermore, machines of the same type can be deployed non-Adjacently in an automated transfer context since materials can easily be transmitted to an arbitrary machine. The flexibility and complexity of the layout make this layout problem extremely difficult to solve. To the best of our knowledge, no dedicated study has been conducted on this issue. Additionally, state-of-The-Art methodologies for related machine layout problems cannot be extended to this problem, partly because one needs to consider the material routing problem explicitly on the orbit network. In this study, we reveal the optimal layout patterns given the relative locations of machines and orbits, and we develop a recursive heuristic that is thousands of times faster than solving the corresponding mixed-integer linear program. Our proposed two-layer hybrid heuristics can solve problems with hundreds of machines, while the inner-layer problem's precision is guaranteed to within 1%. We believe our algorithm can be used for machine and orbit layout design in flexible manufacturing systems where machine-To-machine material shipment is enables in a rectangular trasmission network.  © 2004-2012 IEEE.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85132709218&doi=10.1109%2fTASE.2022.3182031&partnerID=40&md5=e47626e69c37233610c0b199955f4bdd,IEEE Transactions on Automation Science and Engineering,2023
Off-Policy Learning-Based Following Control of Cooperative Autonomous Vehicles Under Distributed Attacks,"This paper investigates the resilient distributed secure output path following control problem of heterogeneous autonomous ground vehicles (AGVs) subject to cyber attacks based on reinforcement learning algorithm. Most existing results are subject to the same attack models for all communication channels, however multiple channels launched by different attackers are considered in this paper. First, a predictor-acknowledgement clock algorithm for each vehicle is proposed to judge whether the communication channel among neighboring vehicles is attacked or not by receiving or transmitting an acknowledgement. Then, a resilient distributed predictor is proposed to predict the pinning vehicle's state for each vehicle. In addition, a resilient local control protocol consisting of the feedforward state provided by the predictor and the local feedback state of each vehicle is developed for the output path following problem, which is further converted to the optimal control problem by designing a discounted performance function. Discounted algebraic Riccati equations (AREs) are derived to address the optimal control problem. An off-policy reinforcement learning (RL) algorithm is put forward to learn the solution of discounted AREs online without any prior knowledge of vehicles' dynamics. It is shown that the RL-based output path following control problem of AGVs imposed by cyber attacks can be achieved in an optimal manner. Finally, a numerical example is provided to verify the effectiveness of theoretical analysis.  © 2000-2011 IEEE.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85148418163&doi=10.1109%2fTITS.2023.3240731&partnerID=40&md5=9ecac0151f1a9af794a45db554080414,IEEE Transactions on Intelligent Transportation Systems,2023
Fast Tube Model Predictive Control for Driverless Cars Using Linear Data-Driven Models,"Model predictive control (MPC) has been widely applied to different aspects of autonomous driving, typically using nonlinear physically derived models for prediction. However, feedback control systems inherently correct for model errors, and thus in many applications it is sufficient to use a linear time-invariant (LTI) model for control design, especially when using robust control methods. This philosophy of approach appears to have been neglected in current driverless car research and is the research gap that we aim to address here. Namely, instead of deriving meticulous nonlinear physical models of vehicle dynamics and solving a correspondingly complex optimal control problem (OCP), we identify a low-order data-driven LTI model and handle its uncertainty via robust linear MPC methods. We develop a two-step control scheme for driverless cars based on tube MPC (TMPC), which introduces structural robustness, ensuring constraint compliance despite modeling error in the data-driven prediction model. Furthermore, we use fast optimization methods designed to exploit the special structure of the linear MPC problem. We evaluate the proposed control scheme using a vehicle model identified from real-world data and simulations in IPGCarmaker, where the model of the vehicle under control is inherently nonlinear and uses detailed 3-D physics. Our results show that an LTI model can be effectively used for the task of lane-keeping, that TMPC can prevent lane departure and possible collisions due to model uncertainty, and that linear models allow for several algorithmic improvements that can decrease computation time by an order of magnitude compared with naive MPC implementations.  © 1993-2012 IEEE.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85144086010&doi=10.1109%2fTCST.2022.3224089&partnerID=40&md5=2c596373841cdea79f6f70e56a80b284,IEEE Transactions on Control Systems Technology,2023
Wireless Distributed Consensus for Connected Autonomous Systems,"Connected critical autonomous systems (C-CASs) are envisioned to significantly change our life and work styles through emerging vertical applications, such as autonomous vehicles and cooperative robots. However, as the scale of the connected nodes continues to grow, their heterogeneity and cybersecurity threats are more eminent, and conventional centralized communications and decision-making methodology are reaching their limit. This article is the first exploration of a trustworthy and fault-tolerant framework for C-CAS for achieving hyperreliable global decision making in a trustless environment, where the connected sensors/nodes are less reliable due to either communication failure or local decision error (e.g., by sensing algorithm/AI, etc.). The proposed framework is based on two iconic distributed consensus (DC) mechanisms: 1) practical Byzantine fault tolerance (PBFT) and 2) Raft, under the proposed perception-initiative-consensus-action (PICA) protocol with wireless connections among the nodes. We first analytically derived consensus reliability in six different system models. The other fundamental performance metrics, such as the consensus throughput and latency, node scalability, and reliability gain are also analytically derived. These analytical results provide basic design guidelines for wireless DC (WDC) usage in the C-CAS systems. The results show that WDC significantly improves overall system reliability with the increasing number of participating nodes.  © 2023 IEEE.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85144775962&doi=10.1109%2fJIOT.2022.3229746&partnerID=40&md5=e0efa7e0007db2594c32fc69516f5e8e,IEEE Internet of Things Journal,2023
Fast Fixed-Time Output Multi-Formation Tracking of Networked Autonomous Surface Vehicles: A Mathematical Induction Method,"In this paper, we aim to exploit an effective way to solve the output multi-formation tracking problem of the networked autonomous surface vehicles (ASVs) in a fast fixed time manner. Specifically, addressing the output multi-formation tracking problem implies that 1) the networked ASVs are divided into multiple interconnected subnetworks with respect to multiple targets; 2) for each subnetwork, the outputs of the networked ASVs form a desired geometric formation with exchanging the local interactions. Besides, solving the fast fixed-time tracking problem in this paper implies that 1) the convergence time is independent of the initial conditions; 2) the system states are forced to reach the employed nonsingular fixed-time sliding surface in a prescribed time, which thus called fast fixed-time control. Then, based on a time-related function and a nonsingular fixed-time sliding surface, a hierarchical fast fixed-time control algorithm is proposed to solve the aforementioned problem within a fast fixed time being independent of the initial conditions. Furthermore, by employing the Lyapunov argument and mathematical induction, we present the sufficient conditions for fast fixed-time convergence of the tracking errors with respect to multiple targets. Finally, numerous simulation examples are presented to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed control algorithm.  © 1967-2012 IEEE.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85147233164&doi=10.1109%2fTVT.2022.3233887&partnerID=40&md5=d32f8be31a39f911a24c0c6761ebe675,IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology,2023
Learned Inertial Odometry for Autonomous Drone Racing,"Inertial odometry is an attractive solution to the problem of state estimation for agile quadrotor flight. It is inexpensive, lightweight, and it is not affected by perceptual degradation. However, only relying on the integration of the inertial measurements for state estimation is infeasible. The errors and time-varying biases present in such measurements cause the accumulation of large drift in the pose estimates. Recently, inertial odometry has made significant progress in estimating the motion of pedestrians. State-of-the-art algorithms rely on learning a motion prior that is typical of humans but cannot be transferred to drones. In this work, we propose a learning-based odometry algorithm that uses an inertial measurement unit (IMU) as the only sensor modality for autonomous drone racing tasks. The core idea of our system is to couple a model-based filter, driven by the inertial measurements, with a learning-based module that has access to the thrust measurements. We show that our inertial odometry algorithm is superior to the state-of-the-art filter-based and optimization-based visual-inertial odometry as well as the state-of-the-art learned-inertial odometry in estimating the pose of an autonomous racing drone. Additionally, we show that our system is comparable to a visual-inertial odometry solution that uses a camera and exploits the known gate location and appearance. We believe that the application in autonomous drone racing paves the way for novel research in inertial odometry for agile quadrotor flight. © 2016 IEEE.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85149364797&doi=10.1109%2fLRA.2023.3252342&partnerID=40&md5=e864733b8ce18e0429ec8a002a9055ad,IEEE Robotics and Automation Letters,2023
Adaptive Resilient Control for Cyber-Physical Systems Under Cyberattack and Input Saturation,"This article investigates the resilient control problem for nonlinear cyber-physical systems with hybrid cyberattacks and physical constraints, including aperiodic denial-of-service attacks, deception attacks, input saturation, and external disturbances. The underlying system is described by the fuzzy model by decomposing the nonlinear plant into some local linear subsystems. An input saturating integrator and an antiwindup compensator are introduced inside a dynamic output feedback fuzzy controller to handle the input saturation in both amplitude and rate. Within the resulting fuzzy-model-based control framework, a novel adaptive event-triggered-based resilient control method is proposed to ensure that the insecure and imperfect system is stochastically stable with an H∞ performance level.

Adaptive cylinder vector particle swarm optimization with differential evolution for UAV path planning,"Particle swarm optimization (PSO) algorithm has a potential to solve route planning problem for unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV). However, the traditional PSO algorithm is easy to fall into local optimum under the complicated environments with multiple threats. In order to improve the performance in different complicated environments, a novel and effective PSO algorithm with adaptive adjustment of the parameters, cylinder vector and different evolution operator, named ACVDEPSO, is proposed and demonstrated to be effective for route planning problem for UAV. In the proposed ACVDEPSO, the velocity of the particle is converted to its cylinder vector for the convenience of the path search. It is worth highlighting that the parameters of ACVDEPSO algorithm are automatically chosen by the time and the fitness values of the particles. Furthermore, a challenger based on differential evolution operator is introduced to reduce the probability of falling into local optimum and accelerate the algorithm convergence speed. The simulation experiments have been conducted in real digital elevation model (DEM) maps to test the performance of the ACVDEPSO. The experiment results validate that the optimization performance of the ACVDEPSO outperforms the other comparison methods, which can efficiently generate a higher quality path for UAV under the complicated 3D environments. © 2023",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85147607722&doi=10.1016%2fj.engappai.2023.105942&partnerID=40&md5=2cd85e330bd5e0862d21e97741e9d879,Engineering Applications of Artificial Intelligence,2023
Secure Computation Offloading for Marine IoT: An Energy-Efficient Design via Cooperative Jamming,"In smart ocean, the Marine Internet of Things (M-IoT) is ubiquitously used for data acquisition, communication connections, task computation, and so on. However, high-efficient energy consumption and secure yet low-latency transmission is subject to IoT devices' computation capacity and transmit power limitation, as well as wireless communication's broadcast characteristics. In this paper, we investigate the secure computation offloading in M-IoT with the assistance of unmanned surface vehicles (USVs) subject to the eavesdropping attack. In particular, we consider a scenario in which USVs are firstly scheduled to set up a high-quality communication link to the high altitude platform (HAP) and then exploited to provide cooperative jamming for the communication security at the physical layer when the HAP is performing computation offloading. We jointly optimize the USVs' positions, the duration of data uploading, the workload offloaded by HAP, the HAP's transmission power, and each USV's jamming signal power to minimize the system-wise energy consumption for completing the total workloads under the latency constraint. Despite the non-convexity, we decompose the problem vertically into a top problem that optimizes the USVs' positions and a bottom problem that optimizes the other variables. The Polyblock outer Approximation and bisection Search based algorithm (PAS-Algorithm) is proposed to alternatively optimize the variables in the bottom problem. And the Code bAsed croSs Entropy algorithm (CASE-Algorithm) is proposed to obtain the suboptimal solution to the formulated joint optimization problem. Numerical results validate the accuracy and effectiveness of our algorithms as well as the performance of optimizing the total energy consumption compared with the benchmark algorithms.  © 1967-2012 IEEE.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85146228622&doi=10.1109%2fTVT.2022.3231295&partnerID=40&md5=13b31e4407089515f976766158ecd939,IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology,2023
Automatic Vehicle Pollution Detection Using Feedback Based Iterative Deep Learning,"Air pollution is one of the major health hazards in modern times. Vehicle pollution is one of the major contributors to aerial contamination. Significant emphasis has been given by the researchers to identify the traffic pollutant sources. However, there is a need for a low-cost, automated solution for fast detection of polluting vehicles from the end of law enforcers. In this article, we have presented a novel deep learning based evaluation strategy that will identify the pollutant vehicle through on- road installed surveillance camera images. An enhanced image data set with notable variations has been prepared for training the models. Thereafter, a multi-model feedback process has been integrated. In contrast to the other deep learning approaches, the proposed framework has started with low labeled training data which is quite relevant in real-life scenarios. Subsequently, the size of the training samples has been increased using feedback. The evaluation of the framework has been performed with seven popular deep learning CNN models, i.e Inception-V3, MobileNet-V2, MobileNet-V3 (small), InceptionResNet-V2, VGG16, VGG19 and XceptionNet. Transfer learning has been exploited to distinguish the on- road pollutants and to provide proper surveillance in transport system. We have compared our method with recent state-of-the-art techniques. The results have demonstrated the superiority of the proposed framework in the road surveillance domain.

Road Shape Classification-Based Matching Between Lane Detection and HD Map for Robust Localization of Autonomous Cars,"Many map matching-based localization algorithms estimate the autonomous car's pose using a registration between lanes measured by a camera and the High-Definition (HD) map. However, the registration methods based on numerical optimization, such as the Iterative Closest Point (ICP) and Normal Distributions Transform (NDT), can cause underdetermined problems due to no unique solution when matching under-constrained lane shapes such as straight lines and circular arcs. This paper proposes a robust localization algorithm with centimeter-level accuracy by applying different matching techniques depending on the road shape. We proposed a road shape classification-based map matching algorithm to overcome the under-constrained problems, which have no unique solution due to insufficient constraints. The proposed algorithm classifies lane segments into line, arc, and clothoid curves considering their curvature characteristics. After that, we find correction information through a map matching and covariance estimation method using lane pairs with the same type of their shape. For the under-constrained shapes, the geometry-based map-matching algorithm and covariance estimation method are applied to avoid underdetermined results. Finally, the measurement calculated from the correction information and predicted pose of the ego-vehicle is exploited for the measurement update of the Extended Kalman Filter (EKF). The proposed method was quantitatively evaluated in the simulation environment, which contains various road shapes, and qualitatively validated for experimental data from an autonomous driving platform. The proposed algorithm shows more robust matching capability, efficient computation time, and higher accuracy than the localization system based on ICP-based lane matching.  © 2016 IEEE.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85141577397&doi=10.1109%2fTIV.2022.3218307&partnerID=40&md5=a6c355f5442ab1988eb781e2c03ef606,IEEE Transactions on Intelligent Vehicles,2023

A cyberattack detection method is designed by using extended Kalman filter, and the computational complexity of the cyberattack detection method is analyzed. In addition, sensor switching rules are developed to isolate the disturbance of cyberattacks. Then, the control problem of the AVs is formulated based on model predictive control. Input-to-state stability of the control system under cyberattacks is established, and a link between the tolerable attack intensity and the detection thresholds is clearly revealed.

Dynamic Scenario Representation Learning for Motion Forecasting With Heterogeneous Graph Convolutional Recurrent Networks,"Due to the complex and changing interactions in dynamic scenarios, motion forecasting is a challenging problem in autonomous driving. Most existing works exploit static road graphs to characterize scenarios and are limited in modeling evolving spatio-temporal dependencies in dynamic scenarios. In this letter, we resort to dynamic heterogeneous graphs to model the scenario. Various scenario components including vehicles (agents) and lanes, multi-type interactions, and their changes over time are jointly encoded. Furthermore, we design a novel heterogeneous graph convolutional recurrent network, aggregating diverse interaction information and capturing their evolution, to learn to exploit intrinsic spatio-temporal dependencies in dynamic graphs and obtain effective representations of dynamic scenarios.

Pistis: Replay Attack and Liveness Detection for Gait-Based User Authentication System on Wearable Devices Using Vibration,"Wearable devices-based biometrics has become mainstream in the biometric domain, especially in mobile computing, due to its convenience, flexibility, and potentially high user acceptance. Among various modalities, wearable devices-based gait recognition has been recognized as an effective user authentication method and employed in various applications, such as automated entry systems for home, school, work, vehicles, and automated ticket payment/validation for public transport. However, how secure wearable gait remains an open research question. In this study, we conduct a comprehensive security analysis of the wearable gait. Then, we demonstrate that gait itself is not robust against some attacking methods, such as spoofing or forgery. Therefore, we argue that an anti-spoofing mechanism is important for enhancing the security of wearable gait biometric systems. To this end, we proposed a novel authentication protocol called Pistis that embedded gait biometrics and a liveness detection mechanism that is aiming to detect various attacks of gait authentication systems. Our extensive experiments based on 50 subjects demonstrate that Pistis is effective in liveness detection and authentication performance enhancement, providing 100% accuracy for human and nonhuman detection, and 99.53% accuracy for user authentication.

Resource Allocation in a Secure Internet of Battle Vehicles Through RF Fingerprint Recognition,"In the internet of battle vehicles (IoBV), a few unauthorized users may attack and intrude on a network. The attackers who sneak into the network may maliciously occupy invaluable wireless resources that are supposed to serve authorized users. To guarantee the quality of service (QoS) of authorized users, we novelly propose an architecture of secure IoBV through the radio frequency (RF) fingerprint recognition technology and investigate the optimal resource allocation scheme under such an architecture.

Multi-Stage RF Emitter Search and Geolocation With UAV: A Cognitive Learning-Based Method,"This paper investigates the issue of searching and geolocating a radio frequency (RF) emitter with an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) in a rich scattering environment. The absence of knowledge of the characteristics of the target RF signals, the ground-to-air channels, and the potential geographical distribution of the RF emitter makes efficient trajectory planning (TP) and geolocating intractable. Since the average signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of the signal captured by the UAV changes across the search area, state-of-the-art TP is inapplicable due to the assumption of a single problem domain, according to the No Free Lunch (NFL) theorem. In contrast, we develop a cognitive multi-stage search and geolocation (CMSG) framework, which adjusts the adopted TP algorithms in various search stages. In the stage with extremely-low SNRs, a random-walk-based TP is proposed to avoid meaningless detours. For stages with higher SNRs, the TP follows policies optimized by a novel search method based on direction of arrival (DOA) estimation and reinforcement learning. To alleviate the impairment of unreliable DOA estimations, empirical emitter position estimations are exploited to find the best flight directions.

Optimizing Vehicle Re-Ordering Events in Coordinated Autonomous Intersection Crossings Under CAVs' Location Uncertainty,"Road intersections represent the primary bottleneck in transportation systems and connected autonomous vehicles (CAVs) have the potential to aleviate the problem through communication and coordination. As such, this work proposes a novel framework where, accounting for CAVs' location uncertainty, an intersection manager (IM) controls CAVs approaching a road crossing so as to maximize the number of admitted vehicles, while ensuring a guaranteed (tunable) level of safety. To fully exploit the communication links among the IM and the CAVs, several features are included in the proposed framework: (i) periodic re-optimizations of the CAVs' applied controls; (ii) periodic re-ordering of the intersection crossing sequence; and (iii) event-based control and ordering optimizations to achieve the best possible trade-off between complexity and performance. The proposed framework is able to improve both the number of admitted CAVs to the intersection and the CAVs' average speeds as compared to relevant state-of-the-art solutions. Importantly, when event-triggering is applied, most of the benefits introduced by periodic optimizations are retained, while at the same time the number of re-optimizations required are reduced by 47.6% (34.18%) during average (heavy) traffic conditions.  © 2016 IEEE.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85144772710&doi=10.1109%2fTIV.2022.3227588&partnerID=40&md5=60e53a5dbc261ea22303e2da16d6f58f,IEEE Transactions on Intelligent Vehicles,2023
Model vs system level testing of autonomous driving systems: a replication and extension study,"Offline model-level testing of autonomous driving software is much cheaper, faster, and diversified than in-field, online system-level testing. Hence, researchers have compared empirically model-level vs system-level testing using driving simulators. They reported the general usefulness of simulators at reproducing the same conditions experienced in-field, but also some inadequacy of model-level testing at exposing failures that are observable only in online mode. In this work, we replicate the reference study on model vs system-level testing of autonomous vehicles while acknowledging several assumptions that we had reconsidered. These assumptions are related to several threats to validity affecting the original study that motivated additional analysis and the development of techniques to mitigate them. Moreover, we also extend the replicated study by evaluating the original findings when considering a physical, radio-controlled autonomous vehicle. Our results show that simulator-based testing of autonomous driving systems yields predictions that are close to the ones of real-world datasets when using neural-based translation to mitigate the reality gap induced by the simulation platform. On the other hand, model-level testing failures are in line with those experienced at the system level, both in simulated and physical environments, when considering the pre-failure site, similar-looking images, and accurate labels. © 2023, The Author(s).",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85159854748&doi=10.1007%2fs10664-023-10306-x&partnerID=40&md5=6003004ccbd8550575f027f820422e45,Empirical Software Engineering,2023
Joint Optimization of Relay Selection and Transmission Scheduling for UAV-Aided mmWave Vehicular Networks,"To deal with the explosive growth of mobile traffic, millimeter-wave (mmWave) communications with abundant bandwidth resources have been applied to vehicular networks. As mmWave signal is sensitive to blockage, we introduce the unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV)-aided two-way relaying system for vehicular connection enhancement and coverage expansion. How to improve transmission efficiency and to reduce latency time in such a dynamic scenario is a challenging problem. In this paper, we formulate the joint optimization problem of relay selection and transmission scheduling, aiming to reduce transmission time while meeting the throughput requirements. To solve this problem, two schemes are proposed. The first one is the random relay selection with concurrent scheduling (RCS), a low-complexity algorithm implemented in two steps. The second one is the joint relay selection with dynamic scheduling (JRDS), which fully avoids relay contentions and exploits potential concurrent ability, to obtain further performance enhancement over RCS. Through extensive simulations under different environments with various flow numbers and vehicle speeds, we demonstrate that both RCS and JRDS schemes outperform the existing schemes significantly in terms of transmission time and network throughput. We also analyze the impact of threshold selection on achievable performance.  © 1967-2012 IEEE.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85147218571&doi=10.1109%2fTVT.2022.3233550&partnerID=40&md5=577ea3f4e962608e964cbc8930610e99,IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology,2023
Semantic-Aware Video Compression for Automotive Cameras,"Assisted and automated driving functions in vehicles exploit sensor data to build situational awareness, however, the data amount required by these functions might exceed the bandwidth of current wired vehicle communication networks. Consequently, sensor data reduction, and automotive camera video compression need investigation. However, conventional video compression schemes, such as H.264 and H.265, have been mainly optimised for human vision. In this paper, we propose a semantic-aware (SA) video compression (SAC) framework that compresses separately and simultaneously region-of-interest and region-out-of-interest of automotive camera video frames, before transmitting them to processing unit(s), where the data are used for perception tasks, such as object detection, semantic segmentation, etc. Using our newly proposed technique, the region-of-interest (ROI), encapsulating most of the road stakeholders, retains higher quality using lower compression ratio. The experimental results show that under the same overall compression ratio, our proposed SAC scheme maintains a similar or better image quality, measured accordingly to traditional metrics and to our newly proposed semantic-aware metrics. The newly proposed metrics, namely SA-PSNR, SA-SSIM, and iIoU, give more emphasis to ROI quality, which has an immediate impact on the planning and decisions of assisted and automated driving functions. Using our SA-X264 compression, SA-PSNR and SA-SSIM have an increase of 2.864 and 0.008 respectively compared to traditional H.264, with higher ROI quality and the same compression ratio. Finally, a segmentation-based perception algorithm has been used to compare reconstructed frames, demonstrating a 2.7% mIOU improvement, when using the proposed SAC method versus traditional compression techniques.  © 2016 IEEE.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85153533960&doi=10.1109%2fTIV.2023.3267443&partnerID=40&md5=1825b426ba036317f3bf51124dd34dfd,IEEE Transactions on Intelligent Vehicles,2023
Dependency Tasks Offloading and Communication Resource Allocation in Collaborative UAV Networks: A Metaheuristic Approach,"Nowadays, unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs)-assisted mobile-edge computing (MEC) systems have been exploited as a promising solution for providing computation services to mobile users outside of terrestrial networks. However, it remains challenging for standalone UAVs to meet the computation requirement of numerous users due to their limited computation capacity and battery lives. Therefore, we propose a collaborative scheme among UAVs to share the workload between them. Furthermore, this work is the first to consider the task topology of offloading in MEC-enabled UAVs networks while restricting their power consumption. We study the task topology, in which a task consists of a set of subtasks, and each subtask has dependencies upon other subtasks. In the real world, subtasks with dependencies must wait for their preceding subtasks to complete before being executed, and this affects the offloading strategy. Next, we formulate an optimization problem to minimize the average latency of users by jointly controlling the offloading decision for dependent tasks and allocating the communication resources of UAVs. The formulated problem is NP-hard and cannot be solved in polynomial time. Therefore, we divide the problem into two subproblems: 1) offloading decision problem and 2) communication resource allocation problem. Then, a metaheuristic method is proposed to find the suboptimal solution to the former problem, while the latter problem is solved by using convex optimization. Finally, we conduct simulation experiments to prove that our proposed offloading technique outperforms several benchmark schemes in minimizing the average latency of users for dependency tasks and achieving higher uplink transmission rates.  © 2014 IEEE.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85147202722&doi=10.1109%2fJIOT.2022.3233667&partnerID=40&md5=1099b66eff6f38ddb5665853a1e7f9d0,IEEE Internet of Things Journal,2023
Secure Cooperative Path Following of Autonomous Surface Vehicles Under Cyber and Physical Attacks,"This paper is concerned with the networked cooperative path following (CPF) problem for multiple autonomous surface vehicles (ASVs) subject to simultaneous cyber and physical attacks. First, to compensate the adverse effects of the physical-attack-induced bias injections, an extended state observer is designed to provide real-time estimates of the unmeasured velocities and unknown nonlinear terms. Next, to identify and handle various cyber attacks, a novel secure data transmission mechanism, featuring a secure transmitter and a secure receiver, is developed for each ASV. Then, a secure CPF control scheme, consisting of a networked cooperative kinematic control law and a networked kinetic control law, is presented. Furthermore, the observer error dynamics and networked CPF error dynamics are derived to account for the simultaneous network-induced delays, packet dropouts, physical attacks, and cyber attacks. The proposed control scheme is capable to preserve satisfactory secure tracking performance of the resulting CPF control system under a desired reference path even in the presence of external environmental disturbances, delays, packet dropouts, and malicious attacks. Finally, several case studies are provided to substantiate the effectiveness of the secure CPF control scheme.  © 2023 IEEE.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85159652035&doi=10.1109%2fTIV.2023.3270266&partnerID=40&md5=02e74b0a2a20b95051882523eb761910,IEEE Transactions on Intelligent Vehicles,2023
Automotive Cybersecurity Vulnerability Assessment Using the Common Vulnerability Scoring System and Bayesian Network Model,"As a promising technology, connected and autonomous vehicle (CAV) can reduce energy consumption and improve transportation safety. Nevertheless, as more enabling technologies are embedded in vehicles, the CAV is becoming more vulnerable to cybersecurity threats. Priority must be given to highly sensitive, life-threatening vulnerabilities. Therefore, an improved vulnerability assessment method for CAVs is proposed in this article, in which the common vulnerability scoring system (CVSS) and Bayes theory are adopted. Compared to the classical CVSS method, our scheme considers the impact of exploited vulnerabilities on the real world. In the meantime, a Bayesian network vulnerability classification model based on the CVSS CAV method is designed to resolve the problem that the CAVs' vulnerability dataset is small and incomplete. The case study as well as simulation results with different datasets or algorithms indicate that our proposal is effective for vehicle vulnerability evaluation.  © 2007-2012 IEEE.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85146219220&doi=10.1109%2fJSYST.2022.3230097&partnerID=40&md5=d4ea7167801234ebf2e18aeda72cd7bd,IEEE Systems Journal,2023
Reactive Symbolic Planning and Control in Dynamic Adversarial Environments,"Satisfying both safety and reachability requirements in dynamic adversarial environments is very challenging, particularly when little or no information about the dynamics and intentions of the adversarial objects is available. Therefore, this article addresses the problem of path planning and control of autonomous vehicles in a dynamic adversarial reach-avoid scenario with two noncooperative vehicles and their competitive objectives: 1) 'reaching a target and avoiding the other vehicle' for one of them, called attacker, and 2) 'protecting the target and capturing the opponent vehicle' for the other one, called defender. In the proposed solution, first, a discrete version of the problem is formulated and solved using linear temporal logic, temporal games, and $\mu$-calculus to construct winning discrete strategies that guarantee safety and reachability. A comprehensive discussion on the existence, correctness, and complexity analysis of the solution is also provided. Finally, a novel correct-by-design hybrid controller is designed to generate smooth control signals that preserve the satisfaction of safety and reachability.  © 1963-2012 IEEE.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85135767596&doi=10.1109%2fTAC.2022.3195431&partnerID=40&md5=9ee1b0edade98637beedf1494e99455d,IEEE Transactions on Automatic Control,2023
Flow-based intrusion detection system in Vehicular Ad hoc Network using context-aware feature extraction,"Autonomous transportation systems have an immense impact on the way of our day-to-day commute or traveling. Connectedness is an inseparable part of these systems, and it is possible through Intelligent Transportation Systems applications. These applications use a network system known as Vehicular Ad hoc Network (VANET). However, the safety that is provided by VANETs can be easily compromised by malicious users. Hence there is a need for an Intrusion Detection System (IDS). We designed an IDS model that can collect network data cooperatively from vehicles and Roadside Units (RSUs). For training the core of our proposed IDS we generated synthetic network data with the help of the widely used Network Simulator 3 (ns-3) and Simulation of Urban Mobility (SUMO) simulation tools. We also generated separate test data that is not just a split part of the training data. This ensures the elimination of the misleading performance result of an overfitted model. We employed a multi-class IDS using Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) with a novel feature extraction method known as Context-Aware Feature Extraction-Based CNN (CAFECNN). The CAFECNN model takes advantage of the collected network flow data to detect both passive and active types of attacks. The results show that the proposed model is stronger in identification of hard-to-detect passive attacks compared to traditional machine learning methods. We also evaluated the model using real-time simulations and observed an immediate improvement in the performance of the network despite the intruders, especially in terms of packet delivery ratio and network throughput. © 2023 Elsevier Inc.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85149460090&doi=10.1016%2fj.vehcom.2023.100585&partnerID=40&md5=4e556ecd5fde2d6634bb7c945678096d,Vehicular Communications,2023
AI Wings: An AIoT Drone System for Commanding ArduPilot UAVs,"Recent advances in drone and artificial intelligence (AI) technologies have enabled many innovative applications, such as package delivery, reconnaissance, and search and rescue, to name a few. In this article, we propose AI wings, an artificial intelligence of things (AIoT) drone system for commanding multiple unmanned aerial vehicles and deploying AI models. We integrated ArduPilot with the Android mobile platform, which equips DIY drones with AI computing power and 4G/5G connectivity. Embedded control software is developed to cooperate with the AI Wings cloud. Users can easily convert ArduPilot drones into AIoT drones using Android phones, and connect to a cloud server to create their own Internet of Drones. Our cloud server is also integrated with the drone simulation software AirSim for simulating drone missions in virtual reality (VR) worlds. The virtual simulation enables users to test software/hardware configurations as well as train AI models. Moreover, to ensure secure communication, we propose an authentication protocol based on elliptic-curve cryptography with pseudoidentities and time freshness check. In summary, AI Wings provides a cloud server for commanding drone fleets securely, software/hardware design for AIoT drones, and VR simulation for training and testing AI models. Users can install the AI models on the drones directly. To test the system, we built an experimental medical drone service, which delivers an automated external defibrillator to people with a sudden cardiac attack in the shortest time possible.  © 2007-2012 IEEE.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85135225348&doi=10.1109%2fJSYST.2022.3189011&partnerID=40&md5=e754027f5ec1ebe932628cb1a2b92b4b,IEEE Systems Journal,2023
A2 RID - Anonymous Direct Authentication and Remote Identification of Commercial Drones,"The recent worldwide introduction of RemoteID (RID) regulations forces all unmanned aircrafts (UAs), also known as drones, to broadcast in plaintext on the wireless channel their identity and real-time location, for accounting and monitoring purposes. Although improving drones' monitoring and situational awareness, the RID rule also generates significant privacy concerns for UAs' operators, threatened by the ease of tracking of UAs and related confidentiality and privacy concerns connected with the broadcasting of plaintext identity information. In this article, we propose anonymous direct authentication and remote identification (A2RID), a protocol suite for A2RID of heterogeneous commercial UAs. 2RID integrates and adapts protocols for anonymous message signing to work in the UA domain, coping with the constraints of commercial drones and the tight real-time requirements imposed by the RID regulation. Overall, the protocols in the 2RID suite allow a UA manufacturer to pick the configuration that best suits the capabilities and constraints of the drone, i.e., either a processing-intensive but memory-lightweight solution (namely, CS-2RID) or a computationally friendly but memory-hungry approach (namely, DS-2RID). Besides formally defining the protocols and formally proving their security in our setting, we also implement and test them on real heterogeneous hardware platforms, i.e., the Holybro X-500 and the ESPcopter, releasing open-source the produced code. For all the protocols, we demonstrated experimentally the capability of generating anonymous RemoteID messages well below the time bound of 1 s required by RID, while at the same time having quite a limited impact on the energy budget of the drone. © 2014 IEEE.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85148423845&doi=10.1109%2fJIOT.2023.3240477&partnerID=40&md5=2e1ba45ef403e304e9af910bba250423,IEEE Internet of Things Journal,2023
Towards uncertainty and sensitivity analysis for modal parameters identification during ice–structure interaction,"The integrity of offshore structures is prone to the threat of drifting sea ice. By exciting the natural frequencies of the ice–structure interaction system, severe vibrations may occur. For a better understanding of how dynamic ice–structure interaction affects the system properties, a stochastic subspace system identification technique, SSI-cov is introduced to identify modal parameters during dynamic ice–structure interactions. Due to the uncertain input variables of SSI-cov, the identified modal parameters suffer from the quantitative judgment of the analyst. To address this problem, this study proposes an uncertainty analysis (UA) framework to obtain estimates of modal parameters. This framework constitutes both a sensitivity analysis (SA) and a UA. First, SA is applied to pick up the input variables that contribute the most to the identified modal parameters. Next, the important variables are left free to vary over their range of existence to obtain the modal parameters’ uncertainties. The framework is applied to full-scale tests from Norströmsgrund lighthouse and model tests carried out in Hamburg Ship Model Basin (HSVA). The comparison with traditional automated modal parameter identification shows its superiority in terms of the accuracy of modal parameters. © 2023 The Authors",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85151858806&doi=10.1016%2fj.oceaneng.2023.114224&partnerID=40&md5=2843c52cf2570fc2bd511c8dc8dae195,Ocean Engineering,2023
A Deadlock-Free Hybrid Estimation of Distribution Algorithm for Cooperative Multi-UAV Task Assignment with Temporally Coupled Constraints,"This article addresses the cooperative multiunmanned aerial vehicles task assignment problem (CMTAP) with temporally coupled constraints and aims to find a feasible assignment to minimize the equivalent distances of all tasks. We first present a mixed-integer linear programming model of CMTAP. To solve the undesirable deadlocks of CMTAP, a Petri net amender is constructed based on a candidate solution, and a deadlock-free solution is equivalent to a feasible transition sequence that can be fired sequentially in the corresponding amender. With this amender, we present a Petri net-based deadlock amending method (PDAM) with polynomial time complexity to convert a deadlocked solution into a deadlock-free solution. Also, a deadlock-free hybrid estimation of distribution algorithm (DHEDA) is developed for CMTAP by embedding PDAM into the original EDA. To further improve the solution quality, we establish a local exploitation method, and an adaptive operational probability is used to balance the computational burden and local exploitation ability. Then, a match-up-based reassignment method is proposed to cope with time-sensitive targets. Finally, extensive computational experiments demonstrate that PDAM is more effective at solving deadlocks than graph-based methods, particularly for large-scale CMTAP, and DHEDA outperforms existing algorithms when solving CMTAP.  © 1965-2011 IEEE.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85144075318&doi=10.1109%2fTAES.2022.3224694&partnerID=40&md5=fccb2286de3cfc502c4cf646f91465ff,IEEE Transactions on Aerospace and Electronic Systems,2023
Anomaly detection and string stability analysis in connected automated vehicular platoons,"In this study, we develop a comprehensive framework to model the impact of cyberattacks on safety, security, and head-to-tail stability of connected and automated vehicular platoons. First, we propose a general platoon dynamics model with heterogeneous time delays that may originate from the communication channel and/or vehicle onboard sensors. Based on the proposed dynamics model, we develop an augmented state extended Kalman filter (ASEKF) to smooth sensor readings, and use it in conjunction with an anomaly detector to detect sensor anomalies. Specifically, we consider two detectors: a parametric detector, the χ2-detector, and a learning-based detector, the one class support vector machine (OCSVM). We investigate the detection power of all combinations of vehicle dynamics models (EKF and ASEKF) and detectors (χ2 and OCSVM). Furthermore, we introduce a novel concept in string stability, namely, pseudo string stability, to measure a platoon's string stability under cyberattacks and model uncertainties. We demonstrate the relationship between the pseudo string stability of a platoon and its detection rate, which enables us to identify the critical detection sensitivity/recall that the platoon's members should meet for the platoon to remain pseudo string stable. © 2023 Elsevier Ltd",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85151795511&doi=10.1016%2fj.trc.2023.104114&partnerID=40&md5=f8fff55b29a6ae0bbc059ee760f80ee7,Transportation Research Part C: Emerging Technologies,2023
MWCRSF: Mobility-based weighted cluster routing scheme for FANETs,"Flying Ad-Hoc Network (FANET) formed by a swarm of Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) is currently a trending research topic because of its capability in performing complex tasks more rapidly and efficiently. However, the high-speed mobility of UAVs, limited energy, and dynamically changing topology have led to critical challenges for the reliability of communication between UAVs, especially when designing routing schemes in FANET. In this paper, we introduce a Mobility-based Weighted Cluster Routing Scheme (MWCRSF) for FANET performance enhancement within the constraints of network resources. MWCRSF utilizes the high-level search efficiency of the Sparrow Search Algorithm (SSA) and a new clustering algorithm based on SSA is first proposed to set up the initial UAV clusters. A weighted sum-based algorithm is then proposed for Cluster Head (CH) selection, where the residual energy, node correlation degree, relative mobility, distance to the Base Station (BS), and average distance are adopted as the selection criteria. To keep the UAV clusters updated, an efficient cluster maintenance algorithm is proposed as well. In order to provide timely and reliable data transmission to the BS, the optimal next-hop route selection is performed considering the link lifetime, residual energy, and distance between nodes and BS. We exploit the power of skyline operators in multi-criteria decision-making to reduce the search space and improve the efficiency of CH selection and next-hop routing. The simulation results reveal that the proposed MWCRSF scheme outperforms the existing methods under different metrics including cluster lifetime, energy efficiency, throughput, and network lifetime. © 2023 Elsevier Inc.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85150510001&doi=10.1016%2fj.vehcom.2023.100603&partnerID=40&md5=dd29aa39b73b4d4d3113bd82fbe2485a,Vehicular Communications,2023
AUV-Assisted Stratified Source Location Privacy Protection Scheme Based on Network Coding in UASNs,"The position of the source is sensitive and critical information in underwater acoustic sensor networks (UASNs). In this study, a network coding-based scheme called the stratified source location privacy protection scheme (SSLP-NC) with autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV) is suggested for a strong adversary that can decode data. First, for the adversary with passive attacks, several fake source selection algorithms are suggested for two circumstances where the source is in the shallow and deep sea, respectively. Each node then utilizes a pseudo-random number generator to create sequences on a regular basis so that the key data can be delivered to the sink without interference. Then, for the adversary with the active attack, the node encrypts the source and fake data using the pre-existing pseudo-random number sequence as an encoding vector to thwart the adversary's decryption. Further, this work develops a relay node selection approach for transmitting the encoded data, which increases the variety of the data transmission pathways. Finally, this study includes a hole avoidance strategy that uses nodes or an AUV to address the potential hole issue. The simulation demonstrates that the SSLP-NC successfully fends off an adversary that can decode data packets, and performs better than the EECOR and DBR-MAC algorithms in terms of network safe time and packet delivery rate. © 2014 IEEE.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85148447671&doi=10.1109%2fJIOT.2023.3240179&partnerID=40&md5=8a3ed7e97689289bc01d19924a802b32,IEEE Internet of Things Journal,2023
Evaluation and Improvement of System-of-Systems Resilience in a Simulation of Wildfire Emergency Response,"Because of the increasing threat that wildfires pose, there is interest in leveraging new technologies to improve firefighting. Specifically, unmanned aerial systems (UAS) and UAS traffic management promise to improve firefighters' situational awareness, coordination, communications, safety, and strategy. While these technologies could be beneficial, there has been little formal investigation into how much benefit would occur and whether these benefits would outweigh hazards introduced by these systems. To better understand the impacts of these technologies, this article presents a high-level dynamic simulation for evaluating wildfire response performance and resilience incorporating fire propagation, surveillance and communication, response planning, and the resulting mitigation actions. This simulation is then used to study the impact of communications and surveillance improvement, considering 1) the effect on fire containment and ground crew injuries and 2) the effect of introduced and existing disruptive fault scenarios. Simulating this model over a large number of scenarios finds that these changes can improve containment and reduce ground crew injuries. While these improvements generalize over both existing and introduced single-fault scenarios and, thus, result in a more resilient system, they could be negated if the introduced communications infrastructure is prone to full-scale outages.  © 2007-2012 IEEE.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85132516748&doi=10.1109%2fJSYST.2022.3169125&partnerID=40&md5=41550ae470b7040d1b01466ba4725be2,IEEE Systems Journal,2023

Time-Driven and Privacy-Preserving Navigation Model for Vehicle-to-Vehicle Communication Systems,"Effective time-driven navigation is an operative way to alleviate traffic congestion, which is also a challenging problem in the Internet of Vehicles context. Most existing centralized navigation systems often cannot react promptly to real-time local traffic situations, while most existing distributed navigation systems are vulnerable to privacy attacks. To overcome these drawbacks, we propose a learning model that provides a provable guarantee of vehicles' privacy while still enabling efficient navigation under real-time traffic conditions. The proposed model adopts a novel multi-agent system with customized differentially private mechanisms.

Benchmark Evaluation of Hybrid Fixed-Flapping Wing Aerial Robot with Autopilot Architecture for Autonomous Outdoor Flight Operations,"This letter is focused on the benchmark evaluation and comparison of the flapping and fixed wing flight modes on an hybrid platform developed for the realization of autonomous inspection operations outdoors. The platform combines the high range and endurance of fixed-wing UAVs (unmanned aerial vehicles), with the higher maneuverability and intrinsic safety of flapping wing in the interaction with humans during the hand launch and capture. A unified model of the hybrid platform is derived for both configurations following the Lagrange formulation to express the multi-body dynamics and aerodynamic forces of the flapping wing and the propellers. The proposed control scheme exploits the similarities of both flight modes in the tail actuation and in the generation of thrust either with the flapping wings or the propellers, in such a way that it can be implemented on conventional autopilots, facilitating in this way the adoption of this type of aerial platforms. To evaluate and compare the performance of both modes, a set of benchmark tests and metrics are defined, including the energy efficiency in forward flight, trajectory tracking, hand launch and capture, and accuracy in visual inspection. Experimental results in outdoors validate the developed prototype, identifying the fixed/flapping transitions, and evidencing the higher energy efficiency of the flapping wing mode compared to the fixed wing.  © 2016 IEEE.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85161015174&doi=10.1109%2fLRA.2023.3280753&partnerID=40&md5=ef94a994991a13408052354203ef4b0f,IEEE Robotics and Automation Letters,2023

Ultra-Reliable Device-Centric Uplink Communications in Airborne Networks: A Spatiotemporal Analysis,"This article proposes an ultra-reliable device-centric uplink (URDC-UL) communication scheme for airborne networks. In particular, base stations (BSs) are mounted on unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) that travel to schedule UL transmissions and collect data from devices. To attain an ultra-reliable unified device-centric performance, the UL connection is established when the UAV-BS is hovering at the nearest possible distance from the scheduled device. The performance of the proposed URDC-UL scheme is benchmarked against a stationary UAV-centric uplink (SUC-UL) scheme where the devices are scheduled to communicate to UAV-BSs that are continuously hovering at static locations. Utilizing stochastic geometry and queueing theory, novel spatiotemporal mathematical models are developed, which account for the UAV-BS spatial densities, mobility, altitude, antenna directivity, ground-to-air channel, and temporal traffic, among other factors. The results demonstrate the sensitivity of the URDC-UL scheme to the ratio between hovering and traveling time. In particular, the hovering to traveling time ratio should be carefully adjusted to maximize the harvested performance gains for the URDC-UL scheme in terms of link reliability, transmission rate, energy efficiency, and delay. Exploiting the URDC-UL scheme allows IoT devices to minimize transmission power while maintaining unified reliable transmission. This preserves the device's battery and addresses a critical IoT design challenge.  © 1967-2012 IEEE.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85149409921&doi=10.1109%2fTVT.2023.3250757&partnerID=40&md5=8e0fedd9e166e1e41e45d7ecd0d25ef1,IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology,2023
Multi-Modal Sensor Fusion and Object Tracking for Autonomous Racing,"Reliable detection and tracking of surrounding objects are indispensable for comprehensive motion prediction and planning of autonomous vehicles. Due to the limitations of individual sensors, the fusion of multiple sensor modalities is required to improve the overall detection capabilities. Additionally, robust motion tracking is essential for reducing the effect of sensor noise and improving state estimation accuracy. The reliability of the autonomous vehicle software becomes even more relevant in complex, adversarial high-speed scenarios at the vehicle handling limits in autonomous racing. In this paper, we present a modular multi-modal sensor fusion and tracking method for high-speed applications. The method is based on the Extended Kalman Filter (EKF) and is capable of fusing heterogeneous detection inputs to track surrounding objects consistently. A novel delay compensation approach enables to reduce the influence of the perception software latency and to output an updated object list. It is the first fusion and tracking method validated in high-speed real-world scenarios at the Indy Autonomous Challenge 2021 and the Autonomous Challenge at CES (AC@CES) 2022, proving its robustness and computational efficiency on embedded systems. It does not require any labeled data and achieves position tracking residuals below 0.1 m.  © 2016 IEEE.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85159741849&doi=10.1109%2fTIV.2023.3271624&partnerID=40&md5=695b4d910e4ae35affbff29eeaffce7e,IEEE Transactions on Intelligent Vehicles,2023
Multi-UAV Cooperative Search Based on Reinforcement Learning With a Digital Twin Driven Training Framework,"This paper considers the cooperative search for stationary targets by multiple unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) with limited sensing range and communication ability in a dynamic threatening environment. The main purpose is to use multiple UAVs to find more unknown targets as soon as possible, increase the coverage rate of the mission area, and more importantly, guide UAVs away from threats. However, traditional search methods are mostly unscalable and perform poorly in dynamic environments. A new multi-agent deep reinforcement learning (MADRL) method, DNQMIX, is proposed in this study to solve the multi-UAV cooperative target search (MCTS) problem. The reward function is also newly designed for the MCTS problem to guide UAVs to explore and exploit the environment information more efficiently. Moreover, this paper proposes a digital twin (DT) driven training framework 'centralized training, decentralized execution, and continuous evolution' (CTDECE). It can facilitate the continuous evolution of MADRL models and solve the tradeoff between training speed and environment fidelity when MADRL is applied to real-world multi-UAV systems. Simulation results show that DNQMIX outperforms state-of-art methods in terms of search rate and coverage rate.  © 2023 IEEE.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85149414194&doi=10.1109%2fTVT.2023.3245120&partnerID=40&md5=792ad51d3636f646befa87e4f7d62982,IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology,2023
Noncooperative and Cooperative Urban Intelligent Systems: Joint Logistic and Charging Incentive Mechanisms,"Autonomous vehicles (AVs) have become an emerging crucial component of the intelligent transportation system (ITS) in modern smart cities. In particular, coordinated operations of AVs can potentially enhance the quality of public services, e.g., logistic and AV charging services. However, the joint logistic and AV charging scenario involves the sophisticated interactions between a large number of complicated agents, dynamic logistics, and electricity prices in real-world systems. Since AVs are individuals owned by different parties, the design of attractive incentive to motivate them to provide multiple public services becomes a fundamental issue. In this article, we develop an urban intelligent system (UIS) by exploiting the efficient incentive mechanisms, e.g., noncooperative and cooperative game-theoretic approaches, to motivate the AVs to provide logistic and charging services in UIS. For the noncooperative game approach, we formulate the interaction between the selfish AVs and the aggregator as a Stackelberg game. Meanwhile, the aggregator, known as the leader in the game, aims to decide the logistic and electricity trading prices, and then the AVs, executed as the followers, determine their service schedules. Furthermore, considering that all the players are willing to cooperate, we develop a cooperative potential game for the selfless AVs to maximize the social welfare of the UIS. These case studies demonstrate the effectiveness and practicability of proposed incentive mechanisms that can motivate EVs to provide high-quality logistic and charging services by maximizing their utilities. Also, both the proposed schemes provide significant system revenues than that of conventional system optimization-based approaches.  © 2014 IEEE.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85149362622&doi=10.1109%2fJIOT.2023.3244550&partnerID=40&md5=25126d9b97c4669754be9169669aba9e,IEEE Internet of Things Journal,2023
PCPNet: An Efficient and Semantic-Enhanced Transformer Network for Point Cloud Prediction,"The ability to predict future structure features of environments based on past perception information is extremely needed by autonomous vehicles, which helps to make the following decision-making and path planning more reasonable. Recently, point cloud prediction (PCP) is utilized to predict and describe future environmental structures by the point cloud form. In this letter, we propose a novel efficient Transformer-based network to predict the future LiDAR point clouds exploiting the past point cloud sequences. We also design a semantic auxiliary training strategy to make the predicted LiDAR point cloud sequence semantically similar to the ground truth and thus improves the significance of the deployment for more tasks in real-vehicle applications. Our approach is completely self-supervised, which means it does not require any manual labeling and has a solid generalization ability toward different environments. The experimental results show that our method outperforms the state-of-the-art PCP methods on the prediction results and semantic similarity, and has a good real-time performance.  © 2016 IEEE.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85161528527&doi=10.1109%2fLRA.2023.3281937&partnerID=40&md5=d5be15f7087bfc7ba62788a65d142821,IEEE Robotics and Automation Letters,2023
Learning When to Use Adaptive Adversarial Image Perturbations Against Autonomous Vehicles,"Deep neural network (DNN) models are widely used in autonomous vehicles for object detection using camera images. However, these models are vulnerable to adversarial image perturbations. Existing methods for generating these perturbations use the image frame as the decision variable, resulting in a computationally expensive optimization process that starts over for each new image. Few approaches have been developed for attacking online image streams while considering the physical dynamics of autonomous vehicles, their mission, and the environment. To address these challenges, we propose a multi-level stochastic optimization framework that monitors the attacker's capability to generate adversarial perturbations. Our framework introduces a binary decision attack/not attack based on the attacker's capability level to enhance its effectiveness. We evaluate our proposed framework using simulations for vision-guided autonomous vehicles and actual tests with a small indoor drone in an office environment. Our results demonstrate that our method is capable of generating real-time image attacks while monitoring the attacker's proficiency given state estimates. © 2016 IEEE.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85161009954&doi=10.1109%2fLRA.2023.3280813&partnerID=40&md5=36e8fcf635b4e3fb043cd222120fdd3f,IEEE Robotics and Automation Letters,2023
Positioning and Contour Extraction of Autonomous Vehicles Based on Enhanced DOA Estimation by Large-Scale Arrays,"As an important branch of Internet of Vehicles (IoV) systems, autonomous vehicle (AV) positioning based on direction-of-arrival (DOA) estimation has received extensive attention in recent years. In this article, an AV positioning method under unknown mutual coupling is proposed within the framework of a large-dimensional asymptotic theory (LAT). First, enhanced and closed-form DOA estimation is achieved by jointly exploiting large-scale uniform linear arrays (ULAs), Toeplitz rectification and the phase transformation result associated with the sample covariance matrix; second, a more reliable subset/set of DOAs is constructed according to the signal-to-noise at receivers; finally, robust AV positioning is achieved with the reliable subset/set. Motivated by satisfactory DOA estimation performance, an AV contour extraction scheme is developed with the aid of two antennas installed on an AV. The proposed method shows several salient advantages compared with existing methods, including improved resolution and accuracy, reduced computational complexity, robustness to mutual coupling and unreasonable DOA estimates, as well as the ability to effectively extract AV contour information. © 2014 IEEE.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85149387623&doi=10.1109%2fJIOT.2023.3244861&partnerID=40&md5=698f41cac12ad91ac7638d4244a54ea3,IEEE Internet of Things Journal,2023
Improve generalization of driving policy at signalized intersections with adversarial learning,"Intersections are quite challenging among various driving scenes wherein the interaction of signal lights and distinct traffic actors poses great difficulty to learn a wise and robust driving policy. Current research rarely considers the diversity of intersections and stochastic behaviors of traffic participants. For practical applications, the randomness usually leads to some devastating events, which should be the focus of autonomous driving. This paper introduces an adversarial learning paradigm to boost the intelligence and robustness of driving policy for signalized intersections with dense traffic flow. Firstly, we design a static path planner which is capable of generating trackable candidate paths for multiple intersections with diversified topology. Next, a constrained optimal control problem (COCP) is built based on these candidate paths wherein the bounded uncertainty of dynamic models is considered to capture the randomness of driving environment. We propose adversarial policy gradient (APG) to solve the COCP wherein the adversarial policy is introduced to provide disturbances by seeking the most severe uncertainty while the driving policy learns to handle this situation by competition. Finally, a comprehensive system is established to conduct training and testing wherein the perception module is introduced and the human experience is incorporated to solve the yellow light dilemma. Simulation results indicate that the trained policy can handle the signal lights flexibly meanwhile realizing smooth and efficient passing with a humanoid paradigm. Besides, APG enables a large-margin improvement of the resistance to the abnormal behaviors and thus ensures a high safety level for the autonomous vehicle. © 2023 Elsevier Ltd",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85159234520&doi=10.1016%2fj.trc.2023.104161&partnerID=40&md5=9c8248ef6293906a4712ada73e8901ea,Transportation Research Part C: Emerging Technologies,2023
A Survey on Safety-Critical Driving Scenario Generation - A Methodological Perspective,"Autonomous driving systems have witnessed significant development during the past years thanks to the advance in machine learning-enabled sensing and decision-making algorithms. One critical challenge for their massive deployment in the real world is their safety evaluation. Most existing driving systems are still trained and evaluated on naturalistic scenarios collected from daily life or heuristically-generated adversarial ones. However, the large population of cars, in general, leads to an extremely low collision rate, indicating that safety-critical scenarios are rare in the collected real-world data. Thus, methods to artificially generate scenarios become crucial to measure the risk and reduce the cost. In this survey, we focus on the algorithms of safety-critical scenario generation in autonomous driving. We first provide a comprehensive taxonomy of existing algorithms by dividing them into three categories: data-driven generation, adversarial generation, and knowledge-based generation. Then, we discuss useful tools for scenario generation, including simulation platforms and packages. Finally, we extend our discussion to five main challenges of current works- fidelity, efficiency, diversity, transferability, controllability- and research opportunities lighted up by these challenges. © 2000-2011 IEEE.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85153389003&doi=10.1109%2fTITS.2023.3259322&partnerID=40&md5=9a5f06c76040ab0569f028f7d729ffe6,IEEE Transactions on Intelligent Transportation Systems,2023
Neural-Network-Based Fuzzy Observer With Data-Driven Uncertainty Identification for Vehicle Dynamics Estimation Under Extreme Driving Conditions: Theory and Experimental Results,"We present a neural network based Takagi-Sugeno (TS) fuzzy observer to estimate the lateral speed (or sideslip angle) of nonlinear vehicle dynamics subject to modeling uncertainties and unknown inputs. To this end, we first propose a TS fuzzy reduced-order observer design, which can be implemented with low computation effort, for nonlinear systems. The stability and robustness of the observer scheme against the modeling uncertainty is guaranteed by the H filtering method. A data-driven approach is proposed to construct feedforward neural networks (NNs) for uncertainty approximation. This data-driven approach exploits a specific sliding mode observer (SMO) to identify the model uncertainty data from the collected training data. The NN-based uncertainty approximation is incorporated into the TS fuzzy observer structure to mitigate the effect of uncertainty and improve the estimation quality. Via Lyapunov's stability theory, design conditions of both the TS fuzzy reduced-order observer for dynamics estimation and the SMO for uncertainty identification are derived in terms of linear matrix inequalities. Experimental results obtained with the INSA autonomous vehicle on a real test track demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed TS fuzzy observer under various driving scenarios. Performance comparisons are also performed to illustrate the interest of using NN-based uncertainty approximation for the new reduced-order observer scheme, especially under extreme driving conditions. © 1967-2012 IEEE.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85149412216&doi=10.1109%2fTVT.2023.3249832&partnerID=40&md5=392539e05288a15271f13b50553f3203,IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology,2023

Power Allocation for Uplink Communications of Massive Cellular-Connected UAVs,"Cellular-connected unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) has attracted a surge of research interest in both academia and industry. To support aerial user equipment (UEs) in the existing cellular networks, one promising approach is to assign a portion of the system bandwidth exclusively to the UAV-UEs. This is especially favorable for use cases where a large number of UAV-UEs are exploited, e.g., for package delivery close to a warehouse. Although the nearly line-of-sight (LoS) channels can result in higher powers received, UAVs can in turn cause severe interference to each other in the same frequency band. In this contribution, we focus on the uplink communications of massive cellular-connected UAVs. Different power allocation algorithms are proposed to either maximize the minimal spectrum efficiency (SE) or maximize the overall SE to cope with the severe interference based on the successive convex approximation (SCA) principle. One of the challenges is that a UAV can affect a large area meaning that many more UAV-UEs must be considered in the optimization problem, which is essentially different from that for terrestrial UEs. The necessity of single-carrier uplink transmission further complicates the problem. Nevertheless, we find that the special property of large coherent bandwidths and coherent times of the propagation channels can be leveraged. The performances of the proposed algorithms are evaluated via extensive simulations in the full-buffer transmission mode and bursty-traffic mode. Results show that the proposed algorithms can effectively enhance the uplink SEs. This work can be considered the first attempt to deal with the interference among massive cellular-connected UAV-UEs with optimized power allocations.  © 2023 IEEE.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85149421979&doi=10.1109%2fTVT.2023.3244653&partnerID=40&md5=57701ff0515f7b6d19dca2c35bc3caf8,IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology,2023
Event-Triggered Adaptive Security Path Following Control for Unmanned Ground Vehicles Under Sensor Attacks,"This paper is concerned with the event-triggered adaptive security control (ET-ASC) for the path following of networked unmanned ground vehicles (UGVs) subject to sensor attacks. Firstly, a security model is well established to capture the dynamics of path following control of UGVs under sensor attacks. Then, the ET-ASC with respect to correction signal is proposed to mitigate the effects of such sensor attacks. In what follows, two theorems, which include both input to state stability (ISS) criterion and controller design method, are carefully derived for the path following control of UGVs under the proposed ET-ASC scheme. The advantage of the proposed ET-ASC scheme lies in that it can actively amend the sensor attacks in an adaptive way and exclude Zeno phenomenon naturally. At last, a verification simulation experiment are conducted to show the effectiveness of the proposed ET-ASC method.  © 1967-2012 IEEE.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85149375181&doi=10.1109%2fTVT.2023.3250709&partnerID=40&md5=3f1169ac035abcaab2a10e35d240488e,IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology,2023
Smart Underwater Pollution Detection Based on Graph-Based Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning Towards AUV-Based Network ITS,"The exploitation/utilization of marine resources and the rapid development of urbanization along coastal cities result in serious marine pollution, especially underwater diffusion pollution. It is a non-trivial task to detect the source of diffusion pollution, such that the disadvantageous effect of the pollution can be reduced. With the vision of 6G framework, we employ Autonomous Underwater Vehicle (AUV) flock and introduce the concept of AUV-based network. In particular, we utilize the Software-Defined Networking (SDN) technique to update the controllability of the AUV-based network, leading to the paradigm of SDN-enabled multi-AUVs network Intelligent Transportation Systems (SDNA-ITS). For SDNA-ITS, we utilize artificial potential field theories to model the control model. To optimize the system output, we introduce the graph-based Soft Actor-Critic (SAC) algorithm, i.e., a category of Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL) mechanism where each AUV can be regarded as a node in a graph. In particular, we improve the optimization model based on Centralized Training Decentralized Execution (CTDE) architecture with the assistance of the SDN controller, by which each AUV can efficiently adjust its speed towards the diffusion source. Further, to achieve exact path planning for detecting the diffusion source, a dynamic detection scheme is proposed to output the united control policy to schedule the SDNA-ITS dynamically. Simulation results demonstrate that our approaches are available to detect the underwater diffusion source when the actual scenario is taken into account and perform better than some recent research products.  © 2000-2011 IEEE.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85127752042&doi=10.1109%2fTITS.2022.3162850&partnerID=40&md5=fab72fd3f0520bf258f066cd65030659,IEEE Transactions on Intelligent Transportation Systems,2023

Sybil Attack Detection in Internet of Flying Things-IoFT: A Machine Learning Approach,"Sybil attack refers to the situation when a malicious node falsely claims to have numerous identities and is known to be one of the security threats to the Internet of Things (IoT). Due to recent increase usage of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) in various applications, Sybil attack has been identified as a threat to the flying ad hoc network (FANET) paradigm and its integration with the IoT to form the Internet of Flying Things (IoFT). In this article, we propose an intelligent Sybil attack detection approach for FANETs-based IoFT using physical layer characteristics of the radio signals emitted from the UAVs as detected by two ground nodes. A supervised machine learning approach is employed and experimented with several different classifiers available in the Weka workbench platform. The experiment was carried out based on two features of the radio signals, namely, the received signal strength difference (RSSD) and the Time Difference of Arrival (TDoA). Simulation results revealed that the proposed scheme can achieve a high correct classification accuracy of above 91% on average, even for smart malicious nodes with power control capability operating at power levels not directly trained. In addition to its high performance, the proposed scheme is also less susceptible to various attacks commonly carried out on the upper layers, such as data spoofing, due to the use of only intrinsically generated physical layer data. Furthermore, no additional communications overheads of the UAV nodes are required for the functionality of this scheme. © 2014 IEEE.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85151499804&doi=10.1109%2fJIOT.2023.3257848&partnerID=40&md5=1cebf65994bf194d64e6380247ecb921,IEEE Internet of Things Journal,2023
A Comparative Analysis of Deadlock Avoidance and Prevention Algorithms for Resource Provisioning in Intelligent Autonomous Transport Systems Over 6G Infrastructure,"6G is the future of intelligent connectivity artefacts with Artificial Intelligence (AI) at its backbone. The Multi-Access Edge Computing (MEC) based 6G enabled infrastructure helps in achieving the required zero latency for autonomous Intelligent Transport Systems (ITS) with features of low power consumption, lower end-to-end latency, minimal processing/transmission overheads, higher throughput and reliability. MEC are prone to a deadlock due to the limited amount of available computational resources, resulting in fatal delays in Vehicle-to-Vehicle (V2V), Vehicles to Road Side Unit (RSU) and RSU to ITS communication. The unresolved deadlock may entail higher energy consumption that can adversely affect the Quality of Service (QoS) in terms of safety and reliability with potential threats of causing fatal accidents. Therefore, it is almost imperative to resolve the deadlocks from MEC to comply with the QoS parameters of MEC based autonomous vehicles. The asserted goals can be achieved by employing an intelligent and adaptive deadlock resolution strategy. In this paper, a deadlock-aware, and collaborative edge decision algorithm has been proposed for facilitating the seamless communication of autonomous vehicles over MEC. Additionally, deadlock avoidance and prevention schemes have been evaluated using Bankers resource request avoidance algorithm, wound wait algorithm and wait-die algorithms for resource provisioning in collaborative MEC. Furthermore, the effectiveness of deadlock avoidance and prevention algorithms in real-time scenarios has been analyzed in MEC systems. The metrics used for a comparative analysis in this research include Round-trip time, Queue wait-time and CPU utilization. The proposed algorithm shows promising results when compared with prevalent techniques.  © 2000-2011 IEEE.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85130443201&doi=10.1109%2fTITS.2022.3169424&partnerID=40&md5=b8b442cde261f8aeb022fe30c43132f9,IEEE Transactions on Intelligent Transportation Systems,2023
Global-local hierarchical path planning scheme for unmanned surface vehicles under dynamically unforeseen environments,"Unmanned surface vehicles (USVs) should be allowed to respond to dynamic ocean environments and self-adjust their paths safely and efficiently. In this paper, considering the challenges posed by time-varying, partially unknown complex environments, a novel hierarchical motion planning framework is elaborately designed for a USV, which includes a global trajectory optimization and a local reactive collision avoidance strategy. By encapsulating the intricate nature of ocean environment, a global optimization path planning problem is developed to systematically strengthen the model's adaptability to the complex engineering problem. Incorporating adaptive elite selection and fuzzy probability set, an adaptive-elite GA with fuzzy inference (AEGAfi) is devised to fully exploit the underlying optimization problem, providing high-quality global paths. By applying virtual sensory vector onto the USV's sensing module, the COLREG-compliant local-reaction is achieved by governing feasible actions of USVs under dynamically unforeseen environments. Seamlessly bridged by the transition Clothoid path, the linkage between global optimization and dynamic-avoidance is strengthened by softening the replanning time restriction and maintaining path continuity. Eventually, the motion planning framework merits autonomous global-planning and local-reaction in an organically modular manner. Comprehensive simulations and comparisons in various ocean scenarios demonstrate the effectiveness and superiority of the proposed framework. © 2023 Elsevier Ltd",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85160316370&doi=10.1016%2fj.oceaneng.2023.114750&partnerID=40&md5=cfcd222a9bf20559fc6ccb65b1aab8b6,Ocean Engineering,2023
Development and testing of a navigation solution for Autonomous Underwater Vehicles based on stereo vision,"Autonomous Underwater Vehicles (AUVs) employed for inspection and monitoring applications require a reliable estimate of their navigation status to successfully accomplish the scheduled mission. Considering that they are typically endowed with vision systems to collect images of the surveyed environment, approaches based on Visual Odometry (VO) allow to utilise the optical payload also to perform robot navigation. Despite a large body of prior research, the topic of navigation based on stereo vision is still an open problem in the marine domain. Within this context, this paper proposes an underwater navigation framework utilising a stereo camera as a linear velocity sensor. The purpose is to assess the potentiality of a stereo vision system to indirectly measure the linear velocity of an AUV, and provide this information to the navigation framework of the vehicle. The proposed strategy consists in a visual inertial odometry solution fusing linear velocity estimates, derived from optical information, with attitude and depth measurements to retrieve the robot navigation status. Such linear velocity estimates are computed exploiting a stereo VO algorithm, relying on a 3D-to-2D approach, whose source code is made available online. The developed strategy is evaluated on real underwater datasets acquired during monitoring surveys performed by an AUV equipped with Doppler Velocity Log (DVL), bottom-looking stereo camera, inertial unit, and depth sensor. The results, obtained through a comparison with the DVL taken as benchmark, confirm the approach as feasible and exploitable in underwater inspection and monitoring contexts. © 2023 Elsevier Ltd",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85160399475&doi=10.1016%2fj.oceaneng.2023.114757&partnerID=40&md5=51a9c1f8c3fd56e546bead97771fc6e3,Ocean Engineering,2023
Hydrodynamic investigations of a cross-domain vehicle with the capability of high-speed cruising on water surface,"With the growing demands for marine resource exploitation and marine defense security deployment, unmanned surface vehicles (USVs) and autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs) are of great value in both civil and military fields. However, both USVs and AUVs can only operate in a single scenario, which is difficult for complex cross-domain missions. Here, we propose a cross-domain vehicle (CDV) with both high-speed mode as USV and diving mode as AUV. To obtain the capability of high-speed cruising on the water surface, two sets of well-tailored hydrofoils are employed for drag reduction by adjusting the attitudes of CDV. Numerical investigations are carried out to evaluate the hydrodynamic characteristics of the CDV at different velocities. Moreover, prototype tests are conducted in open water, demonstrating its technical feasibility and validating the numerical methods. The results demonstrate a maximum drag reduction of 43% and a significant improvement in longitudinal stability with elaborate design of the hydrofoils. The mechanism of the drag reduction is revealed by flow field analysis, which is a joint effect resulting from the inhibition of wave-making as well as the reduction of the wetted surface area. The current work has significant value for future improvement of CDVs. © 2023",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85153879930&doi=10.1016%2fj.oceaneng.2023.114688&partnerID=40&md5=c5af7b734cf9dad10312d20a0cda74ee,Ocean Engineering,2023
Deep Learning-Based Trajectory Planning and Control for Autonomous Ground Vehicle Parking Maneuver,"In this paper, a novel integrated real-time trajectory planning and tracking control framework capable of dealing with autonomous ground vehicle (AGV) parking maneuver problems is presented. In the motion planning component, a newly-proposed idea of utilizing deep neural networks (DNNs) for approximating optimal parking trajectories is further extended by taking advantages of a recurrent network structure. The main aim is to fully exploit the inherent relationships between different vehicle states in the training process. Furthermore, two transfer learning strategies are applied such that the developed motion planner can be adapted to suit various AGVs. In order to follow the planned maneuver trajectory, an adaptive learning tracking control algorithm is designed and served as the motion controller. By adapting the network parameters, the stability of the proposed control scheme, along with the convergence of tracking errors, can be theoretically guaranteed. In order to validate the effectiveness and emphasize key features of our proposal, a number of experimental studies and comparative analysis were executed. The obtained results reveal that the proposed strategy can enable the AGV to fulfill the parking mission with enhanced motion planning and control performance. Note to Practitioners - This article was motivated by the problem of optimal automatic parking planning and tracking control for autonomous ground vehicles (AGVs) maneuvering in a restricted environment (e.g., constrained parking regions). A number of challenges may arise when dealing with this problem (e.g., the model uncertainties involved in the vehicle dynamics, system variable limits, and the presence of external disturbances). Existing approaches to address such a problem usually exploit the merit of optimization-based planning/control techniques such as model predictive control and dynamic programming in order for an optimal solution. However, two practical issues may require further considerations: 1). The nonlinear (re)optimization process tends to consume a large amount of computing power and it might not be affordable in real-time; 2). Existing motion planning and control algorithms might not be easily adapted to suit various types of AGVs. To overcome the aforementioned issues, we present an idea of utilizing the recurrent deep neural network (RDNN) for planning optimal parking maneuver trajectories and an adaptive learning NN-based (ALNN) control scheme for robust trajectory tracking. In addition, by introducing two transfer learning strategies, the proposed RDNN motion planner can be adapted to suit different AGVs. In our follow-up research, we will explore the possibility of extending the developed methodology for large-scale AGV parking systems collaboratively operating in a more complex cluttered environment.  © 2004-2012 IEEE.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85133796546&doi=10.1109%2fTASE.2022.3183610&partnerID=40&md5=3b01d4f9fa2c8c5eaa76f4f021925452,IEEE Transactions on Automation Science and Engineering,2023
A novel path planning approach for AUV based on improved whale optimization algorithm using segment learning and adaptive operator selection,"A novel path planning approach for autonomous underwater vehicles is proposed in this paper. It seeks a better navigation path under complex terrain and uncertain ocean currents. On the one hand, this problem is converted into a deterministic optimization problem using the order relation of interval number and vector analysis method. On the other hand, the whale optimization algorithm using segment learning and adaptive operator selection is proposed to solve this problem. Firstly, the elite and edge sets are judged by fitness and Euclidean distance, respectively. Based on them, a dynamic partitioning strategy and a weighted mean strategy are used to construct virtual individuals. The virtual individuals are incorporated into the whale optimization algorithm to construct an evolutionary pool, which can realize the balance between exploration to exploitation to improve the search ability of the algorithm. Second, an adaptive operator selection mechanism considering individual preferences is added to the algorithm. This mechanism uses the operators’ historical information and future projections to guide the individual in choosing an appropriate evolutionary operator. The simulation results show that the robustness and search capability of the algorithm presented in this study are more potent than other comparative algorithms. © 2023 Elsevier Ltd",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85153609256&doi=10.1016%2fj.oceaneng.2023.114591&partnerID=40&md5=1f4d27494963661af3b9ded8d5214e4f,Ocean Engineering,2023
Multi-domain clustering pruning: Exploring space and frequency similarity based on GAN,"Network compression plays an important role in accelerating deep neural networks, especially in the application of edge devices such as unmanned cars and drones. Recently, pruning-based methods have been improved significantly, but they still suffer from low efficiency because most of them only pay attention to feature similarities in the space domain. In this paper, we propose a multi-domain structured pruning method based on clustering (MDCP) which seamlessly integrates sufficient information extraction and knowledge distillation within a GAN-based framework, to address these aforementioned limitations. Specifically, 1) to exhaustively analyze the features for reasonable pruning, we perform pruning taking both space and frequency information into account, which considering the spectral statistics to produce a more accurate pruning map; 2) to tackle the distance distortion problem caused by feature insufficiency, we further propose a clustering-based measurement mechanism to acquire pruning guidance under extreme conditions; 3) to avoid the dependence on labels and fine-tuning in previous works, a generative adversarial mechanism with two label-level losses is introduced, which further ensures the pruning efficiency and accuracy. Such a multi-domain clustering-based framework along with an adversarial and contrastive learning pattern significantly improves the pruning quality. Comprehensive experiments conducted on four benchmarks demonstrate that our MDCP method performs favorably against existing competitors. Notably, for CIFAR-10 dataset, our method on ResNet-110 outperforms the former state-of-the-art method (94.33%) in terms of top-1 accuracy (94.61%) and achieves a maximum parameter pruning rate (73.33%). © 2023 Elsevier B.V.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85154048829&doi=10.1016%2fj.neucom.2023.126279&partnerID=40&md5=6070aa9a1a99d7a69d98d2a2a7d0d862,Neurocomputing,2023
Secure Data Sharing With Flexible Cross-Domain Authorization in Autonomous Vehicle Systems,"As an increasingly prevalent technology in intelligent autonomous transportation systems, autonomous vehicle platoon has been indicated the ability to significantly reduce fuel consumption as well as heighten highway safety and throughput. However, existing efforts rarely focus on protecting data confidentiality and authenticity in autonomous vehicle platoons. How to ensure secure and high-fidelity platoon-level communication is still in its infancy. This paper makes the first attempt for efficient and secure communication across autonomous vehicle platoons. Specifically, we present PDSM-FC, the first privacy-preserving data share mechanism with flexible cross-domain authorization over distinctive platoons. The key insight of PDSM-FC is the design of a new ciphertext conversion technique, which allows a ciphertext to be easily converted into another type of ciphertext, facilitating efficient access by all entities holding the legitimate authorization. As a result, PDSM-FC can achieve high-fidelity data communication between two unique platoons in ciphertext, so as to complete specific tasks including platoon integration. Rigorous security analysis shows that PDSM-FC is secure against various attacks such as collusion, forgery and chosen-plaintext attacks. Moreover, theoretical evaluation and extensive experiments demonstrate the practicability of PDSM-FC in terms of functionality, storage and computation overheads.  © 2000-2011 IEEE.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85126539624&doi=10.1109%2fTITS.2022.3157309&partnerID=40&md5=6139fa14eac7947b08a6ee87e01a0b0f,IEEE Transactions on Intelligent Transportation Systems,2023
Bayesian Optimization Enhanced Deep Reinforcement Learning for Trajectory Planning and Network Formation in Multi-UAV Networks,"In this paper, we employ multiple UAVs coordinated by a base station (BS) to help the ground users (GUs) to offload their sensing data. Different UAVs can adapt their trajectories and network formation to expedite data transmissions via multi-hop relaying. The trajectory planning aims to collect all GUs' data, while the UAVs' network formation optimizes the multi-hop UAV network topology to minimize the energy consumption and transmission delay. The joint network formation and trajectory optimization is solved by a two-step iterative approach. Firstly, we devise the adaptive network formation scheme by using a heuristic algorithm to balance the UAVs' energy consumption and data queue size. Then, with the fixed network formation, the UAVs' trajectories are further optimized by using multi-agent deep reinforcement learning without knowing the GUs' traffic demands and spatial distribution. To improve the learning efficiency, we further employ Bayesian optimization to estimate the UAVs' flying decisions based on historical trajectory points. This helps avoid inefficient action explorations and improves the convergence rate in the model training. The simulation results reveal close spatial-temporal couplings between the UAVs' trajectory planning and network formation. Compared with several baselines, our solution can better exploit the UAVs' cooperation in data offloading, thus improving energy efficiency and delay performance.  © 1967-2012 IEEE.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85151556086&doi=10.1109%2fTVT.2023.3262778&partnerID=40&md5=deca3c543789337c710bbd293ce95db6,IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology,2023
Public Blockchain-Envisioned Security Scheme Using Post Quantum Lattice-Based Aggregate Signature for Internet of Drones Applications,"Due to high effectiveness and robust security protocols, lattice-based cryptography becomes a very broadly applicable optimistic post-quantum technique that is recently used in public key cryptosystem. An aggregate signature scheme enables a party to bundle a set of signatures together into a single short cryptographic signature, which can be verified by any verifier using the public information. In this paper, we provide a lattice-based aggregate signature scheme where the security depends on the difficulty of the Ring Learning-with-Error (Ring-LWE) problem. Next, we use the basic scheme in Internet of Drones (IoD) applications using the blockchain technology for secure and transparent data storage. The detailed security analysis and comparative study show that the proposed scheme provides superior security including resistance to quantum attacks and is efficient as compared to the existing state of art approaches. The testbed experimental results and the blockchain simulation demonstrate that the proposed scheme can be applied in real-life drones applications.  © 1967-2012 IEEE.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85151565908&doi=10.1109%2fTVT.2023.3260579&partnerID=40&md5=3aad4f9361d8a65345721c34109d43ab,IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology,2023
HOOPOE: High Performance and Efficient Anonymous Handover Authentication Protocol for Flying out of Zone UAVs,"The unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) in military and civilian systems access sensitive data via cellular networks and are ubiquitous. Therefore, the number of handovers may increase, and the process of sharing authentication keys between drones to new drones may be vulnerable to eavesdropping due to the wireless connectivity. For example, a UAV initially served by cell A may be handed over to cell B after a certain point. Therefore, Security and privacy concerns raise if there is a change in the flight path of the UAV due to wide-area connectivity traffic management, including authentication threats as well as the leakage of identity, location, and flying routes. Also, drones are resource-constrained devices that cannot perform extensive operations, leading to the inability to resist drone capture attacks and impersonation attacks. Therefore, this paper presents a high-performance and efficient anonymous handover authentication protocol to secure the drone traveling path. The protocol utilizes the advantages of the AES-RSA algorithm to provide efficient and secure key management and a fast verification and signature generation that speeds up drone authentication. The protocol's security was proved using the formal verification ROR model and automated security verifier ProVerif tool to validate the protocol resistance against various attacks and provided forward secrecy. In addition, the performance of the proposed protocol is evaluated using the OMNeT++ simulator in terms of communication, computation cost, energy consumption, packet drop ratio, end-to-end delay, and throughput. The results showed that the protocol achieves better security, efficiency, and performance than other protocols.  © 1967-2012 IEEE.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85151492734&doi=10.1109%2fTVT.2023.3262173&partnerID=40&md5=12a76528f6bf4336181134b2da3c1408,IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology,2023
Interference Analysis for UAV Radar Networks With Guard Zones Based on Stochastic Geometry,"Due to the increasing number of aerial radars and joint communication/sensing technologies, interference from uncoordinated radars will limit the target detection and ranging performance in the future. In this article, we investigate the interference behavior in an aerial radar network for sensing ground targets. We consider that the radars mounted on unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) that fly at a certain altitude are randomly distributed according to a two-dimensional homogeneous Poisson point process (HPPP), and that the propagation is modeled using a probabilistic line-of-sight channel model. For such a sensing network, we derive the distribution of the radar interference using a stochastic geometry based analysis. In particular, when Swerling I model is considered for radar cross-section area for the target, we derive the Laplace transform of the radar interference. To avoid a strong interference between neighboring radars, a guard zone is introduced within which the UAV radar transmission around the permitted active radar is inhibited. As the radar performance metric, we derive the successful ranging probability (SRP) of a given radar by exploiting the Laplace transform of radar interference. Using the analytic SRP, we show that we can optimize the radar network parameters such as the radius of the guard zone and the density of the active radars. In addition, we also discuss how the analytic SRP gives an insight into the spectrum utilization strategy for the UAV radar networks with the guard zones.  © 1965-2011 IEEE.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85147228164&doi=10.1109%2fTAES.2023.3236308&partnerID=40&md5=4f8aa311cb01e2ce0dca3f3e8432d9cb,IEEE Transactions on Aerospace and Electronic Systems,2023
Secure and Efficient UAV Tracking in Space-Air-Ground Integrated Network,"With the development of 5G and other communication techniques, the space-air-ground integrated network (SAGIN) is regarded as a promising solution to provide wide-range, cost-effective, and real-time wireless access. Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) Tracking plays a crucial role in guaranteeing the performance of SAGIN. However, UAV tracking still faces a series of challenges in the real-world deployment, especially in the case of the presence of malicious attackers, who may launch a series of attacks (e.g., message spoofing attack, routing misbehavior attack) to disrupt the systems. In this study, to enhance the security and efficiency of SAGIN when conducting object tracking, we propose a novel and secure object tracking system named SecTracker to overcome the emerging security problems in the SAGIN. Focusing on the unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) tracking, we design the Local Voting based Detection Module to defend the message spoofing attack and implement the Routing Evidence based Detection Module to defend the routing misbehavior attack. Besides, efficiency enhancement mechanisms (i.e., probabilistic detection algorithm and game theory based algorithm) are proposed in this paper to improve the efficiency of SecTracker. Considering the above-mentioned attacks, the overall tracking accuracy is improved from 88.16% in existing schemes to 96.64% in SecTracker, which demonstrates the effectiveness of the proposed system.  © 1967-2012 IEEE.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85149859492&doi=10.1109%2fTVT.2023.3253894&partnerID=40&md5=d9e51f4e598f6b7893e8a3031e490da3,IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology,2023
Model Predictive Control with Wind Preview for Aircraft Forced Landing,"Autonomous emergency landing capability of fixed-wing aircraft is essential for opening airspace for civil unmanned aviation. This article proposes a goal-oriented control scheme to exploit wind information for the benefit of forced landing. Different from general disturbances in a classic control system, a favorable wind would help aircraft to glide to a selected landing site more easily so increase the level of safety while an adverse wind may render a selected landing site infeasible. We formulate the forced landing problem with wind preview information in the framework of economic model predictive control (EMPC), which aims to maximize the aircraft's final altitude when reaching a target region. A double-layer model predictive control (MPC) scheme is adopted to lessen the computational burden and to increase the prediction time window for practical implementation, where a piecewise-constant disturbance-preview-based EMPC maximizes the altitude at the upper level, and a linear MPC is employed at the lower level to track the reference signal optimized by the upper-level planner. Moreover, the effectiveness of the goal-oriented optimal control scheme is illustrated by several case studies, where an unmanned aircraft is gliding toward potential landing sites under various conditions.  © 1965-2011 IEEE.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85147203978&doi=10.1109%2fTAES.2023.3235321&partnerID=40&md5=90970aaae7b0c8518d2b367b2a3d0c3d,IEEE Transactions on Aerospace and Electronic Systems,2023
Distributional and hierarchical reinforcement learning for physical systems with noisy state observations and exogenous perturbations,"Reinforcement learning has shown remarkable success in various applications, and in some cases, even outperforms human performance. However, despite the potential of reinforcement learning, numerous challenges still exist. In this paper, we introduce a novel approach that exploits the synergies between hierarchical reinforcement learning and distributional reinforcement learning to address complex sparse-reward tasks, where noisy state observations or non-stationary exogenous perturbations are present. Our proposed method has a hierarchical policy structure, where random rewards are modeled as random variables that follow a value distribution. This approach enables the handling of complex tasks and increases robustness to uncertainties arising from measurement noise or exogenous perturbations, such as wind. To achieve this, we extend the distributional soft Bellman operator and temporal difference error to include the hierarchical structure, and we use quantile regression to approximate the reward distribution. We evaluate our method using a bipedal robot in the OpenAI Gym environment and an electric autonomous vehicle in the SUMO traffic simulator. The results demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach in solving complex tasks with the aforementioned uncertainties when compared to state-of-the-art methods. Our approach demonstrates promising results in handling uncertainties caused by noise and perturbations for challenging sparse-reward tasks, and could potentially pave the way for the development of more robust and effective reinforcement learning algorithms in real physical systems. © 2023 Elsevier Ltd",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85160434823&doi=10.1016%2fj.engappai.2023.106465&partnerID=40&md5=870e2cedae15b9b67f1bbf6d16dd59b4,Engineering Applications of Artificial Intelligence,2023
Secrecy Rate Maximization by Cooperative Jamming for UAV-Enabled Relay System With Mobile Nodes,"In recent years, unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) have been widely used in wireless communications due to their low cost, small size, flexible deployment, and mobile controllability. However, because of the Line-of-Sight (LoS) communication links, the security threat is always a challenging problem to deal with. In particular, information stolen and leakage may happen in the presence of eavesdroppers. This article proposes a UAV-enabled system with a relay UAV and a jammer UAV, and certain mobile source and destination nodes in the presence of an eavesdropper to solve the secrecy rate maximization problem. In this system, the relay UAV transmits information between pairs of moving source nodes and moving destination nodes with interrupted communication channels due to blockage or long distance, and the jammer UAV interferes with eavesdropper to reduce the milked information through sending jamming signals. We establish an average secrecy rate maximization problem with trajectory and transmit power optimization under certain constraints for this system. Since this problem is nonconvex and reformulated as the Markov decision process (MDP), we use deep reinforcement learning (DRL) method to solve it. In this article, we adopt a proximal policy optimization (PPO) algorithm to find an optimal solution because it can deal with the model of continuous action space. According to our defined states, rewards, and actions in this specified MDP, this algorithm can autonomously learn to optimize the trajectory and power allocation of the UAVs to realize our goal. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed PPO-based average secrecy rate maximization algorithm is valid, effective and scalable.  © 2014 IEEE.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85153385860&doi=10.1109%2fJIOT.2023.3263191&partnerID=40&md5=412f3f0bde1c1928ed54173e6a77bdf5,IEEE Internet of Things Journal,2023
All-Day Object Tracking for Unmanned Aerial Vehicle,"Unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) has facilitated a wide range of real-world applications and attracted extensive research in the mobile computing field. Specially, developing real-time robust visual onboard trackers for all-day aerial maneuver can remarkably broaden the scope of intelligent deployment of UAV. However, prior tracking methods have merely focused on robust tracking in the well-illuminated scenes, while ignoring trackers' capabilities to be deployed in the dark. In darkness, the conditions can be more complex and harsh, easily posing inferior robust tracking or even tracking failure. To this end, this work proposes a novel discriminative correlation filter-based tracker with illumination adaptive and anti-dark capability, namely ADTrack. ADTrack firstly exploits image illuminance information to enable adaptability of the model to the given light condition. Then, by virtue of an efficient enhancer, ADTrack carries out image pretreatment where a target aware mask is generated. Benefiting from the mask, ADTrack aims to solve a novel dual regression problem where dual filters are online trained with mutual constraint. Besides, this work also constructs a UAV nighttime tracking benchmark UAVDark135. Exhaustive experiments on authoritative benchmarks and onboard tests are implemented to validate the superiority and robustness of ADTrack in all-day conditions.  © 2002-2012 IEEE.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85127471652&doi=10.1109%2fTMC.2022.3162892&partnerID=40&md5=d4fec4acec6ff065d207a79202148d15,IEEE Transactions on Mobile Computing,2023
Reinforcement learning-based multi-strategy cuckoo search algorithm for 3D UAV path planning,"Unmanned aerial vehicles are applied extensively in various fields due to their advantages of low-cost, high-maneuverability, and easy-operation. However, the path planning problem of unmanned aerial vehicles, which directly determines the flight safety and efficiency, still remains challenging when building and optimizing the path model. To further study the path planning problem, we firstly construct it as a constrained optimization problem. The objective function considers the costs of path length and threat, and the constraints involve the collision and turning angle. Additionally, we employ the theory of B-Spline curve to represent the planned paths to facilitate the optimization of established model. Then, aiming at the poor searchability and slow convergence speed of current optimization methods, we propose a reinforcement learning-based multi-strategy cuckoo search algorithm. Specifically, we establish an innovative reinforcement learning-based multi-strategy mechanism and a reinforced switch parameter based on the theory of reinforcement learning.

With the centralized management ability of the SDN technique, we propose the software-defined Centralized Training Decentralized Execution (CTDE) architecture based on the graph-based Soft Actor-Critic (SAC) algorithm to optimize the system control and management. To improve the computing and training efficiency, we embed the self-attention mechanism into the critic network construction, leading to a self-attention-based SAC algorithm.

Jamming-Enhanced Secure UAV Communications with Propulsion Energy and Curvature Radius Constraints,"A multi-unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs)-aided secure communication network is studied, where multiple information UAVs carrying temporary aerial base stations transmit confidential information to multiple authorized receivers (ARs), and a jammer UAV is employed to send artificial noise to multiple unauthorized receivers (URs) for mitigating information leakage. Some practical constrains including the inter-UAV interference among the information UAVs and the jammer UAV, the maximal available propulsion energy at UAVs, and the curvature radius limitations of UAVs' trajectories are concurrently taken into account. In order to maximize the minimum secrecy rate among the ARs, the AR scheduling, the UAVs' power allocation and the trajectories of UAVs are jointly optimized by formulating a multi-variable optimization problem. To solve the non-convex problem efficiently, we present a block coordinate descent (BCD)-based approach, where the penalty dual decomposition (PDD)-based algorithm is designed to optimize the AR scheduling, and successive convex approximation (SCA)-based algorithm is proposed to optimize the UAVs' power allocation and the trajectories of UAVs. The complexity of the presented BCD-based approach is analyzed, which achieves polynomial complexity. Simulation results show that imposing curvature radius limitations on the UAVs' trajectory design is effective to avoid sharp turning of UAVs. Moreover, as curvature radius increases, the system max-min secrecy rate decreases. Besides, the secrecy rate performance of the system can be enhanced by exploiting one jammer UAV to interfere with the URs.  © 1967-2012 IEEE.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85151555934&doi=10.1109%2fTVT.2023.3259723&partnerID=40&md5=7a1244eb49313c7983ead1f3097fbb9d,IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology,2023
Short-range air combat maneuver decision of UAV swarm based on multi-agent Transformer introducing virtual objects,"With the development of Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) swarm technology, there has been a growing interest in using Artificial Intelligence (AI) to drive UAV swarms for short-range air combat. However, due to the complexity of situation information in UAV swarm air combat, making accurate air combat decisions based on air combat situation information has become a challenge. In this paper, we propose the multi-agent Transformer introducing virtual objects (MTVO) to address this issue. First, the proposed approach designs a multi-agent Transformer network structure by exploiting the homogeneity feature of the UAV state information in the swarm. This structure enables the structured processing of complex situation information. Specifically, the local situation information of each UAV is calculated by self-attention, which reduces the size of the swarm situation information while retaining the information of key UAVs. This approach reduces the difficulty of processing UAV swarm situation information. Moreover, we add a virtual object to the UAV swarm information to assist in calculating the weight distribution of the local situation. The weighted fusion of local situations allows us to obtain a more effective representation of the global situation, which serves as the basis for more accurate air combat maneuver decisions.

Optimal feedback control law for automated vehicles in the presence of cyberattacks: A min–max approach,"While automated vehicles (AVs) are expected to bring a wide range of benefits to future transportation systems, emerging AV technologies open a door for cyberattacks, where a select number of AVs are compromised to drive in an adversarial manner. This could result in network-wide increases in traffic congestion and energy consumption, degrading the performance of transportation systems. Hence, it is necessary to develop attack mitigation strategies for AVs as AVs gradually become a reality. However, this is rather challenging due to the lack of knowledge of adversaries. Limited prior studies have assumed attacks with a given probability distribution without considering their malicious intention, which is far from realistic due to the adversarial nature of potential attacks. In this study, we derive an optimal feedback control law for AVs in the presence of cyberattacks. Notably, attacks are only assumed to have a bounded magnitude without being subject to any specific statistical distribution, which is not only of theoretical interest but also relaxes the assumptions seen in prior studies. More importantly, to deal with lack of knowledge of malicious attacks, we, for the first time, formulate a min–max control problem to minimize the worst-case disturbance to traffic flow. Specifically, we present a mathematical framework for describing mixed-autonomy traffic involving AVs and human-driven vehicles (HVs), considering two typical types of attacks, namely false data injection attack on sensor measurements and malicious attack on AV control commands. Based on the framework presented, we derive a set of necessary conditions of optimality for the min–max control problem, based on which an iterative computational algorithm is developed for determining the optimal control (driving) strategy of AVs. The effectiveness of the proposed approach is demonstrated via extensive numerical simulations. © 2023 Elsevier Ltd",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85162972496&doi=10.1016%2fj.trc.2023.104204&partnerID=40&md5=3a26659cc0868dbbdc2f5b591990f6ac,Transportation Research Part C: Emerging Technologies,2023

This paper proposes a real-time planning and collision avoidance method based on deep reinforcement learning for USVs in complex environments. Firstly, a novel reward function is designed, which transforms the collision avoidance problem into a deep reinforcement learning strategy solution problem that includes distance, direction, speed, and GOLREGs constraints, it ensures the smooth and safe operation of the USV. Secondly, inefficient exploration and exploitation methods make it difficult for intelligent agents to discover key information in the environment, high value experience is obtained through the designed layered sampling exploration mechanism in this article, the intelligent agent learns effective control strategies through this mechanism, which accelerates the convergence of the strategies and reduces the waste of computing resources. Finally, a real-time collision avoidance simulation platform for the USV is established, and experimental results of different exploration mechanisms are compared, the efficiency of the layered sampling exploration mechanism has been verified. The simulation scenarios from easy to difficult are designed, and the results indicate that the USV can complete real-time planning and collision avoidance tasks in complex environments. © 2023",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85161301168&doi=10.1016%2fj.oceaneng.2023.115018&partnerID=40&md5=9af2d414e0c06dd0e5f327261e40a832,Ocean Engineering,2023
Unmanned surface vehicle navigation through generative adversarial imitation learning,"In the artificial intelligent and big data technology era, the marine industry among others is inevitably developing in this direction, aiming at becoming autonomous and completing tasks without relying on human involvement while providing safety. The technology of small unmanned surface vehicles (USVs) is relatively mature but with a large development potential and wide research interest expecting significant benefits such as safety and high efficiency in shipping and transportation systems. This article addresses these issues and utilizes an imitation learning algorithm to resolve autonomous navigation for USVs even in complex environmental conditions. We formulate the trajectory modeling as a data-driven imitation learning problem where we employ a state of the art imitation learning algorithm. Experiments are performed in a particular simulated environment tailored to match the specific weather conditions of the local area. The simulation results show the potential of the proposed imitation learning scheme to create advanced intelligent agents for USVs under real-world environmental settings, and USV actuation constraints that allow to predict trajectories with high accuracy and safety. In addition, we evaluated the method's robustness in generating successful trajectories under environmental conditions that differed from those encountered during training, thereby promoting knowledge reusing without the need for retraining. © 2023 Elsevier Ltd",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85162032237&doi=10.1016%2fj.oceaneng.2023.114989&partnerID=40&md5=6bbcedd95fd6699e54f1e93440f11ae7,Ocean Engineering,2023
SeqOT: A Spatial-Temporal Transformer Network for Place Recognition Using Sequential LiDAR Data,"Place recognition is an important component for autonomous vehicles to achieve loop closing or global localization. In this article, we tackle the problem of place recognition based on sequential 3-D LiDAR scans obtained by an onboard LiDAR sensor. We propose a transformer-based network named SeqOT to exploit the temporal and spatial information provided by sequential range images generated from the LiDAR data. It uses multiscale transformers to generate a global descriptor for each sequence of LiDAR range images in an end-to-end fashion. During online operation, our SeqOT finds similar places by matching such descriptors between the current query sequence and those stored in the map. We evaluate our approach on four datasets collected with different types of LiDAR sensors in different environments. The experimental results show that our method outperforms the state-of-the-art LiDAR-based place recognition methods and generalizes well across different environments. Furthermore, our method operates online faster than the frame rate of the sensor. © 1982-2012 IEEE.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85146218107&doi=10.1109%2fTIE.2022.3229385&partnerID=40&md5=16ddad0c8452e6d814fa73c4dee939aa,IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics,2023
An Attentive Spatio-Temporal Learning-Based Network for Cardiovascular Disease Diagnosis,"Automated diagnosis of cardiovascular diseases (CVDs) has become an imperative need for remote or in-hospital heart monitoring. This is a challenging task because of the tenuous morphological variation of the electrocardiogram (ECG) signal across different cardiac diseases. Existing works have attempted to learn the diagnostic representation by capturing the lead-specific morphological variation of a multilead ECG signal. In this work, we have developed an attentive spatio-temporal learning network (ASTLNet) that can learn better diagnostic representation by exploiting the concurrent spatio-temporal variation of a multilead ECG signal. The ASTLNet consists of two modules, i.e., spatio-temporal representation learning (STRL) module and attentive spatio-temporal aggregation (ASTA) module. The STRL module is designed to learn the multiscale spatio-temporal representation, and the ASTA module is designed to aggregate the learned representation. Experiments on the three publicly available datasets, i.e., PTB, PTB-XL, and CPSC-2018, demonstrate that the proposed model can effectively learn the spatio-temporal variation of the ECG signal and gives superior performance compared to the state-of-the-art methods.  © 2022 IEEE.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85151508823&doi=10.1109%2fTSMC.2023.3257022&partnerID=40&md5=67990f3ab306f6e6c9ab6e46a45dc17b,"IEEE Transactions on Systems, Man, and Cybernetics: Systems",2023
Sailing efficiency optimization and experimental validation of a Petrel long-range autonomous underwater vehicle,"Long-range autonomous underwater vehicles (LRAUVs) generally carry limited energy during observation missions, making it critical to enhance sailing efficiency through optimization design. Therefore, it is essential to understand the relationship between the shape parameters, motion modes, and sailing efficiency. This study proposes a LRAUV energy consumption model considering the variation in seawater density and drive loss, to obtain higher accuracy. In the optimization design, a surrogate model based on the response surface method is applied to establish the functional relationship between shape parameters, sailing parameters, and sailing efficiency. According to the optimization results, the AUV mode shows better efficiency in shallow sea, while the glider mode is more suitable for deep-sea operation. For the AUV mode, the applicable working band increases with the working time at fixed depth and/but decreases with the increase of the angle of attack at fixed depth. For the glider mode, the applicable working band increases the buoyancy compensation coefficient. The hotel load has less impact on the applicable working band for both modes. Based on the proposed method, a Petrel LRAUV with an optimized shape and sailing efficiency is developed, which can also serve as a reference for the preliminary design of other LRAUVs. © 2023 Elsevier Ltd",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85153861813&doi=10.1016%2fj.oceaneng.2023.114604&partnerID=40&md5=371b5ebc47ca66355a4523f9f59261e3,Ocean Engineering,2023
Fast Reactive Mechanism for Desired Trajectory Attacks on Unmanned Aerial Vehicles,"Malware, exposed on the ground control station, can tamper with the unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) interaction information. It makes UAVs vulnerable to the desired trajectory attacks, which deteriorates the flight safety if no timely action is taken. Therefore, this article focus on fast reactive mechanism for desired trajectory attacks on UAVs. A fixed-time detection scheme is proposed based on fixed-time unknown inputs observer and trajectory tracking errors. Subsequently, a fixed-time sliding mode attack observer is developed to compensate the effect caused by attacks. Meanwhile, the estimation errors of attacks can be stabilized within fixed time.

AoI-Aware Resource Allocation for Platoon-Based C-V2X Networks via Multi-Agent Multi-Task Reinforcement Learning,"This paper investigates the problem of age of information (AoI) aware radio resource management for a platooning system. Multiple autonomous platoons exploit the cellular wireless vehicle-to-everything (C-V2X) communication technology to disseminate the cooperative awareness messages (CAMs) to their followers while ensuring timely delivery of safety-critical messages to the Road-Side Unit (RSU). To lower the computational load at the RSU and cope with the challenges of dynamic channel conditions, we exploit a distributed resource allocation framework based on multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL), where each platoon leader (PL) acts as an agent and interacts with the environment to learn its optimal policy. Motivated by the existing literature in RL, we propose two novel MARL frameworks based on the multi-agent deep deterministic policy gradient (MADDPG), named Modified MADDPG, and Modified MADDPG with task decomposition. Both algorithms train two critics with the following goals: A global critic which estimates the global expected reward and motivates the agents toward a cooperating behavior and an exclusive local critic for each agent that estimates the local individual reward. Furthermore, based on the tasks each agent has to accomplish, in the second algorithm, the holistic individual reward of each agent is decomposed into multiple sub-reward functions where task-wise value functions are learned separately. Numerical results indicate our proposed algorithms' effectiveness compared with other contemporary RL frameworks, e.g., federated reinforcement learning (FRL) in terms of AoI performance and CAM message transmission probability.  © 1967-2012 IEEE.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85151545935&doi=10.1109%2fTVT.2023.3259688&partnerID=40&md5=b53ee4a591341649569777b0abcde160,IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology,2023
Graph Neural Networks for Intelligent Transportation Systems: A Survey,"Graph neural networks (GNNs) have been extensively used in a wide variety of domains in recent years. Owing to their power in analyzing graph-structured data, they have become broadly popular in intelligent transportation systems (ITS) applications as well. Despite their widespread applications in different transportation domains, there is no comprehensive review of recent advancements and future research directions that covers all transportation areas. Accordingly, in this survey, for the first time, we provide an overview of GNN studies in the general domain of ITS. Unlike previous surveys, which have been limited to traffic forecasting problems, we explore how GNN frameworks have evolved for different ITS applications, including traffic forecasting, demand prediction, autonomous vehicles, intersection management, parking management, urban planning, and transportation safety. Also, we micro-categorize the studies based on their transportation application to identify domain-specific research directions, opportunities, and challenges, which have been missing in previous surveys. Moreover, we identify unique and undiscussed research opportunities and directions, which is the result of reviewing a wide range of transportation applications. The neglected role of edge and graph learning in ITS applications, developing multi-modal models, and exploiting the power of unsupervised and reinforcement learning methods for developing more powerful GNNs are some examples of such new discussions in this survey. Finally, we have identified popular baseline models and datasets in each transportation domain, which facilitate the development and evaluation of future GNN-based frameworks.  © 2000-2011 IEEE.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85151504119&doi=10.1109%2fTITS.2023.3257759&partnerID=40&md5=de23bdc265551157642bcbed5dbe0053,IEEE Transactions on Intelligent Transportation Systems,2023
SaCHBA_PDN: Modified honey badger algorithm with multi-strategy for UAV path planning,"The honey badger algorithm (HBA) is a meta-heuristic optimization algorithm that simulates the foraging behavior of honey badgers. Since the algorithm is prone to premature convergence when solving complex optimization problems. To improve the overall optimization performance of the basic HBA, this paper develops a modified HBA named SaCHBA_PDN based on the Bernoulli shift map, piecewise optimal decreasing neighborhood, and horizontal crossing with strategy adaptation and applies it to solve the unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) path planning problem. Firstly, the Bernoulli shift map is invoked to the HBA algorithm to change its initialization process, thus increasing the diversity of the population and speeding up the convergence speed. Secondly, a new piecewise optimal decreasing neighborhood strategy (PODNS) is proposed to address the shortcomings of unbalanced convergence of the traditional optimal neighborhood strategy. The proposed PODNS increases the optimization efficiency of HBA and enhances the local search ability to avoid falling into the local optimum. Finally, a novel horizontal crossing with strategy adaptation is introduced to balance exploration and exploitation and enhance the global optimization ability. These strategies collaborate to enhance HBA in accelerating overall performance. The superiority of SaCHBA_PDN is comprehensively verified by comparing it with the original HBA and numerous celebrated and newly developed algorithms on the well-known 23 classical benchmark functions and IEEE CEC2017 test suite, respectively. Experimental results show that SaCHBA_PDN has a better performance than other optimization algorithms. Furthermore, SaCHBA_PDN is used to solve a UAV path planning problem based on the threat source model and applied to circular and irregular obstacle scenarios as well as two-dimensional grid maps. Simulation results show that SaCHBA_PDN can obtain more feasible and efficient paths in different obstacle environments. © 2023 Elsevier Ltd",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85151035038&doi=10.1016%2fj.eswa.2023.119941&partnerID=40&md5=51835b594b4460b532803466f27b2c0a,Expert Systems with Applications,2023
Automatic Model-Based Dataset Generation for High-Level Vision Tasks of Autonomous Driving in Haze Weather,"Improving the performance of high-level computer vision tasks in adverse weather (e.g., haze) is highly critical for autonomous driving safety. However, collecting and annotating training sets for various high-level tasks in haze weather are expensive and time-consuming. To address this issue, we propose a novel haze generation model called HazeGEN by coupling the variational autoencoder and the generative adversarial network to automatically generate annotated datasets. The proposed HazeGEN leverages a shared latent space assumption based on an optimized encoder-decoder architecture, which guarantees high fidelity in the cross-domain image translations. To ensure that the generated image can truly facilitate high-level vision task performance, a semisupervised learning strategy is developed for HazeGEN to efficiently learn the useful knowledge from both the real-world images (with unsupervised losses) and the synthetic images generated following the atmosphere scattering model (with supervised losses). Extensive experiments and ablation studies demonstrate that training the model with our generated haze dataset greatly improves accuracy in high-level tasks such as semantic segmentation and object detection. Furthermore, one important but under-exploited issue is investigated to find out whether the developed dataset can be a good substitute for the real ones. Results show that the generated dataset has the most similar performance to the real-world collected haze dataset on multiple challenging industrial scenarios compared with prior works. © 2005-2012 IEEE.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85144072173&doi=10.1109%2fTII.2022.3224958&partnerID=40&md5=0d203c0741edd91bdbc8d5a81dc2adbd,IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics,2023
Secure Transmission Scheme Based on Joint Radar and Communication in Mobile Vehicular Networks,"Vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) communication applications face significant challenges to security and privacy since all types of possible breaches are common in connected and autonomous vehicles (CAVs) networks. As an inheritance from conventional wireless services, potential eavesdropping is one of the main threats to V2V communications. In our work, the anti-eavesdropping scheme in CAVs networks is developed through the use of cognitive risk control (CRC)-based vehicular joint radar-communication (JRC) system. In particular, the supplement of off-board measurements acquired using V2V links to the perceptual information has presented the potential to enhance the traffic target positioning precision. Then, transmission power control is performed utilizing reinforcement learning, the result of which is determined by a task switcher. Based on the threat evaluation, a multiple armed bandit problem is designed to implement the secret key switching procedure when it is needed.

A Learning-Based Nonlinear Model Predictive Controller for a Real Go-Kart Based on Black-Box Dynamics Modeling Through Gaussian Processes,"Lately, nonlinear model predictive control (NMPC) has been successfully applied to (semi-) autonomous driving problems and has proven to be a very promising technique. However, accurate control models for real vehicles could require costly and time-demanding specific measurements. To address this problem, the exploitation of system data to complement or derive the prediction model of the NMPC has been explored, employing learning dynamics approaches within learning-based NMPC (LbNMPC). Its application to the automotive field has focused on discrete gray-box modeling, in which a nominal dynamics model is enhanced by the data-driven component. In this manuscript, we present an LbNMPC controller for a real go-kart based on a continuous black-box model of the accelerations obtained by Gaussian processes (GP).

ParallelEye Pipeline: An Effective Method to Synthesize Images for Improving the Visual Intelligence of Intelligent Vehicles,"Virtual simulated scenes are becoming a critical part of autonomous driving. In the context of knowledge automation and machine learning, simulated images are widely used for visual environmental perception. However, even the most inspirational applications have not fully exploited the potential of simulated images in solving real-world problems. In this article, we propose a novel framework 'ParallelEye Pipeline,' which uses image-to-image translation and simulated images to automatically generate realistic synthetic images with multiple ground-truth annotations. Specifically, this method has three steps: first, we use Unity3D software to simulate driving scenarios and generate simulated image pairs (including raw images and six ground-truth labels) from the simulated scenes; second, advanced image-to-image translation algorithms can generate realistic and high-resolution synthetic images from simulated image pairs; third, we exploit publicly datasets, simulated images, and synthetic images to conduct experiments for visual perception.

A Robust CACC Scheme Against Cyberattacks via Multiple Vehicle-to-Vehicle Networks,"Cooperative Adaptive Cruise Control (CACC) is a vehicular technology that allows groups of vehicles on the highway to form in closely-coupled automated platoons to increase highway capacity and safety. The underlying mechanism behind CACC is the use of Vehicle-to-Vehicle (V2V) wireless communication networks to transmit acceleration commands to adjacent vehicles in the platoon. However, the use of V2V networks leads to increased vulnerabilities against faults and cyberattacks. Here, we address the problem of increasing the robustness of CACC schemes against cyberattacks by using multiple V2V networks and a data fusion algorithm. The idea is to transmit acceleration commands multiple times through different communication channels to create redundancy at the receiver side. We propose a data fusion algorithm to estimate of the true acceleration command, and isolate compromised channels. Finally, we propose a robust H_∞ controller that reduces the joint effect of fusion errors and sensor/channel noise in the platooning performance (tracking performance and string stability).

A Jamming Aware Artificial Potential Field Method to Counter GPS Jamming for Unmanned Surface Ship Path Planning,"Global positioning system (GPS) plays an important role in the path planning of unmanned surface ships. As we know, the civil GPS signal is not encrypted, and its structure is open. Meanwhile, the power strength of GPS signals arriving at receivers is weak. All of these make GPS vulnerable to jamming. GPS jamming attacks adversely affect the accuracy of the received GPS signals, thus affecting the path planning results of unmanned surface ships and even causing collisions. This article presents a jamming aware artificial potential field (JA-APF) method. The JA-APF method first determines whether GPS jamming exists in unmanned surface ships' surrounding environment by detecting the receivers' received signal strength and calculating the packet error rate. Then, the JA-APF method calculates the position range of the jamming source. Finally, the JA-APF method replans the path according to the resultant force of the attraction around the goal, the repulsion around obstacles, and the repulsion around multiple GPS jammers. Through the simulation, we determine the value of the repulsive potential factor of the jammer to optimize the path planning results of the JA-APF method and analyze the influence of the jamming power on the path planning results. The simulation results show that the JA-APF method can effectively solve the impact of GPS jamming on the results in the path planning process and recover as soon as possible.  © 2007-2012 IEEE.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85148433783&doi=10.1109%2fJSYST.2023.3237613&partnerID=40&md5=727f2986238c3c66e181b69111b4a871,IEEE Systems Journal,2023
Model-free finite-time formation containment control of underactuated UUVs subject to input delays and unknown interaction information,"This paper put forwards a model-free adaptive neural finite-time formation-containment (FC) control scheme for time-delayed underactuated unmanned underwater vehicles (UUVs) with unknown dynamic models and some interaction information under switching topologies. The UUVs are steered by multiple child leaders moving along with a root leader, where all leaders are virtual and defined by a new generalized dynamic. A novel autoregressive model-based state predictor is created for each UUV, which can construct future motion states online relying on current and stored states. Considering the containment layer, a finite-time super-twisting observer is used to recover the unavailable interaction information. Moreover, observer-based finite-time kinematic guidance laws employing only 3D positions of the neighboring UUVs are devised, together with protocols for completing formation in finite time. Aiming to accurately identify unknown dynamics and control gains simultaneously, estimator-based adaptive neural networks are introduced exploiting both historical and real-time data. Finally, model-free anti-disturbance finite-time kinetic control protocols are designed based on the data-driven adaptive neural networks and nonlinear tracking differentiators. It is proven that all signals of the closed-loop FC system are bounded, the deployed FC tracking can be achieved in finite time.

UAV-Assisted Wireless Backhaul Networks: Connectivity Analysis of Uplink Transmissions,"With the proliferation of wireless communication technologies, user equipments (UEs) in rural or disaster areas have data-transmission demand to upload their data to the core network. However, current networks lack coverage in rural or disaster areas due to the absence or damage of/to infrastructures. To address this issue, a promising solution is employing unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) as relays to assist the wireless backhaul of UEs to remote ground base stations (GBSs). For convenience, we call these networks as UAV-assisted wireless backhaul networks (UABNs). This paper aims to investigate the uplink transmission performance in UABNs. In particular, we analyze the connectivity of the two-hop uplink path from a reference UE to a remote GBS via a reference UAV. Compared with previous studies that mostly analyze single-hop transmissions, the investigation of the path connectivity of UABNs is more complex because of the location variation of UAVs as well as the complexity of the interference at the two-hop path. Considering the distribution of UEs, we exploit stochastic geometry to establish a theoretical model to analyze the path connectivity of UABNs. In our model, UEs form clusters according to a Poisson Cluster Process (PCP) and one UAV serves one UE cluster. Based on our model, the connectivity of a two-hop uplink path is finally derived by limiting the signal-to-noise-plus-interference (SINR) above a threshold. Theoretical values of the connectivity of UABNs match with simulation results, confirming the accuracy of the proposed analytical model. Our results also offer insightful implications for constructing and configuring UABNs. © 1967-2012 IEEE.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85153527625&doi=10.1109%2fTVT.2023.3268025&partnerID=40&md5=43fb9659115cd55cab3374b65493299e,IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology,2023
IRS-Enabled Secure G2A Communications for UAV System With Aerial Eavesdropping,"As one of the most promising new technologies in the upcoming 6G communication, intelligent reflecting surface (IRS) can significantly improve the reliability of wireless transmission and deal with the security threat in the presence of eavesdroppers by smartly reconfiguring the wireless propagation environment. However, existing research mainly focuses on terrestrial communication networks. In contrast, there is not much research on IRS-aided secure unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) communication problems, especially for ground-to-air (G2A) communication scenarios with air eavesdroppers that will bring greater security threats. In this article, we consider an IRS-assisted G2A communication network with an altitude-dependent Rician fading channel, where the ground base station (BS) transmits legitimate information to the UAV user in the presence of air eavesdroppers. The transmission power, active and passive beamforming, and UAV 3-D trajectory are jointly optimized to maximize the average secrecy rate. Due to the nonconvexity of the optimization problem, the block coordinate descent method is used to solve it. Specifically, the overall optimization problem is divided into four subproblems, and nonconvex subproblems are solved by successive convex approximation and semidefinite relaxation algorithms. Simulation results show that the proposed alternating optimization algorithm has a good convergence performance and can increase the average secrecy rate by 28% compared with the scenario without IRS assistance.  © 2007-2012 IEEE.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85141587680&doi=10.1109%2fJSYST.2022.3214813&partnerID=40&md5=4b29decb5158d82ceb4709b27187a253,IEEE Systems Journal,2023
Secrecy Rate Degradation of Ground-to-Air Collaborative Beamforming Due to UAV Jitter,"In this article, we consider the secure uplink transmissions from ground nodes to an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) receiver through analog collaborative beamforming (ACB).

ACB-based physical layer security (PLS) algorithm, where the virtual antenna array (VAA) elements are randomly selected at each transmit time unit, can effectively protect against eavesdropping attacks by creating artificial noise to the directions except the legitimate receiver (Bob). However, when Bob is mounted on the UAV, it can suffer from array gain loss due to jittering effects caused by airflow turbulence and mechanical vibration. Motivated by this issue, in this article, we investigate the impact of the UAV jitter on the secrecy performance. We derive the theoretical expressions of the secrecy rate both in the absence and presence of the jittering effects. Further, the simulation results show that the ACB-based PLS cannot guarantee non-zero secrecy rate even with the radial distance perturbations on the order of a few centimeters, especially when an eavesdropper (Eve) exists in close proximity to Bob. © 1967-2012 IEEE.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85153373503&doi=10.1109%2fTVT.2023.3266193&partnerID=40&md5=c040f970bfb457e63ed281422fc1fae3,IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology,2023
Study on a Boat-Assisted Drone Inspection Scheme for the Modern Large-Scale Offshore Wind Farm,"This study proposes a novel and comprehensive boat-assisted drone inspection scheme for offshore wind farms. Specifically, we develop a unique wireless communication model, a detailed wind turbine blade detection model, and a route planning scheme for the drone and boat to formulate the minimum energy consumption problem for drone inspection. Then, we demonstrate that this problem is a combinatorial optimization mixed-integer nonlinear programming problem, which we solve by decomposing the optimization problem into four subproblems. Moreover, an improved heuristic algorithm is constructed to solve the optimum energy consumption problem, exploiting these subproblems. The simulation results indicate that the proposed scheme achieves optimal energy consumption for boat-assisted drone inspection. Furthermore, compared with the existing methods, the proposed algorithm obtains the lowest total energy consumption and provides a higher route planning performance for the unmanned aerial vehicle and boat when utilized for offshore wind farm inspection.  © 2007-2012 IEEE.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85161030810&doi=10.1109%2fJSYST.2023.3272948&partnerID=40&md5=74f4b019c8f7ae0b48f40f60f01067cf,IEEE Systems Journal,2023
Secure IoU in Adversarial Environments: User Authentication and Performance Optimization,"The emerging UAV network suffers from severe security risks from attackers. If the attackers sneak into an Internet of UAV (IoU) network, they would occupy the scarce resources which should be allocated among authenticated users, degrading the communication performance. Therefore, a two-stage scheme is proposed to both enhance IoU security and optimize network resource allocation. In the first stage, a distributed radio-frequency fingerprinting-based authentication model with consensus voting is designed to enhance the IoU security. Moreover, in the second stage, a performance optimization problem in consideration of authentication accuracy is formulated to maximize the data rate. It is proved that the problem can be transformed into a potential game, which implies that the optimization of the overall network's utility equals the optimization of each individual's utility. Also, the existence of this game's Nash equilibrium (NE) is proved and an iterative algorithm is used to achieve its NE. Finally, simulation results show that that our proposed consensus-based authentication model improves recognition accuracy by 40% compared to the conventional Adaboost method under typical parameter settings, and our proposed algorithm can improve the network utility significantly. The effect of various parameters on the utility is also numerically verified. © 1967-2012 IEEE.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85153342311&doi=10.1109%2fTVT.2023.3266770&partnerID=40&md5=ee7e30defc9dee6b9255fcc479c7037d,IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology,2023
Aggregated Zero-Knowledge Proof and Blockchain-Empowered Authentication for Autonomous Truck Platooning,"Platooning technologies enable trucks to drive cooperatively and automatically, providing benefits including less fuel consumption, greater road capacity, and safety. To establish trust during dynamic platooning formation, ensure vehicular data integrity, and guard platoons against potential attackers in mixed fleet environments, verifying any given vehicle's identity information before granting it access to join a platoon is pivotal. Besides, due to privacy concerns, truck owners may be reluctant to disclose private vehicular information, which can reveal their business data to untrusted third parties. To address these issues, this is the first study to propose an aggregated zero-knowledge proof and blockchain-empowered system for privacy-preserving identity verification in truck platooning. We provide the correctness proof and the security analysis of our proposed authentication scheme, highlighting its increased security and fast performance. The platooning formation procedure is re-designed to seamlessly incorporate the proposed authentication scheme, including the 1st catch-up and cooperative driving steps. The blockchain performs the role of verifier within the authentication scheme and stores platooning records on its digital ledger to guarantee data immutability and integrity. In addition, the proposed programmable access control policies enable truck companies to define who is allowed to access their platoon records. We implement the proposed system and perform extensive experiments on the Hyperledger platform. The results show that the blockchain can provide low latency and high throughput, the aggregated approach can offer a constant verification time of 500 milliseconds regardless of the number of proofs, and the platooning formation only takes seconds under different strategies. The experimental results demonstrate the feasibility of our design for use in real-world truck platooning. © 2000-2011 IEEE.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85159843288&doi=10.1109%2fTITS.2023.3271436&partnerID=40&md5=c6d7beda0e1dc6664a6d9c3a88f3ed13,IEEE Transactions on Intelligent Transportation Systems,2023
Multitrajectory Model Predictive Control for Safe UAV Navigation in an Unknown Environment,"The problem of navigating an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) in an unknown environment is addressed with a novel model predictive control (MPC) formulation, named multitrajectory MPC (mt-MPC). The objective is to safely drive the vehicle to the desired target location by relying only on the partial description of the surroundings provided by an exteroceptive sensor. This information results in time-varying constraints during the navigation among obstacles. The proposed mt-MPC generates a sequence of position set points that are fed to control loops at lower hierarchical levels. To do so, the mt-MPC predicts two different state trajectories, a safe one and an exploiting one, in the same finite horizon optimal control problem (FHOCP). This formulation, particularly suitable for problems with uncertain time-varying constraints, allows one to partially decouple constraint satisfaction (safety) from cost function minimization (exploitation). Uncertainty due to modeling errors and sensors noise is taken into account as well, in a set membership (SM) framework. Theoretical guarantees of persistent obstacle avoidance are derived under suitable assumptions, and the approach is demonstrated experimentally out-of-the-laboratory on a prototype built with off-the-shelf components.  © 1993-2012 IEEE.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85141627994&doi=10.1109%2fTCST.2022.3216989&partnerID=40&md5=ca5d3d5501ff1efd806aa7c9932fc915,IEEE Transactions on Control Systems Technology,2023
QoS-Dependent Event-Triggered Control for UAVs on Cognitive Radio Networks Subject to Deception Attacks,"Based on cognitive radio (CR) networks, this paper considers event-triggered control for unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) systems subject to deception attacks. Two states (ON and OFF) are switched in CR networks. For the switched model, a new Quality of Service (QoS)-dependent event-triggered scheme (ETS) is proposed over CR networks under deception attacks. For a non-ideal QoS, more sensitive trigger parameters are required against deception attacks. For an ideal QoS, less sensitive trigger parameters are adjusted to reduce data transmissions. Based on the QoS-dependent ETS, a new switched system is modeled subject to deception attacks. By constructing the Lyapunov functional, the criteria are obtained to guarantee the exponential mean-square stability of UAV systems and the desired L_∞ performance. Moreover, an algorithm is developed to adjust the parameters of QoS-dependent ETS according to the QoS of CR network. Finally, an UAV system is utilized to show the effectiveness of the proposed approach. © 1967-2012 IEEE.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85159718641&doi=10.1109%2fTVT.2023.3271326&partnerID=40&md5=bffd65d03c942c26a2887e7cf1aa6311,IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology,2023
Anomaly Detection Against GPS Spoofing Attacks on Connected and Autonomous Vehicles Using Learning from Demonstration,"GPS spoofing attacks pose great challenges to connected vehicle (CVs) safety applications and localization of autonomous vehicles (AVs). In this paper, we propose to utilize transportation and vehicle engineering domain knowledge to detect GPS spoofing attacks towards CVs and AVs. A novel detection method using learning from demonstration is developed, which can be implemented in both vehicles and at the transportation infrastructure. A computational-efficient driving model, which can be learned from historical trajectories of the vehicles, is constructed to predict normal driving behaviors. Then a statistical method is developed to measure the dissimilarities between the observed trajectory and the predicted normal trajectory for anomaly detection. We validate the proposed method using two threat models (i.e., attacks targeting the multi-sensor fusion system of AVs and attacks targeting the intersection movement assist application of CVs) on two real-world datasets (i.e., KAIST and Michigan roundabout dataset). Results show that the proposed model is able to detect almost all of the attacks in time with low false positive and false negative rates. © 2000-2011 IEEE.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85159656211&doi=10.1109%2fTITS.2023.3269029&partnerID=40&md5=d6c71b417fc3d9e90d7307dc047612b3,IEEE Transactions on Intelligent Transportation Systems,2023
CAVIDS: Real time intrusion detection system for connected autonomous vehicles using logical analysis of data,"In recent times, Connected Autonomous Vehicles (CAVs) have been gaining popularity and have already begun to revolutionize the transport industry, mainly using real-time monitoring, analysis and exchange of data through In-Vehicle Networks (IVN). IVN can also interact with the outside world and roadside infrastructures. With all these advantages, certain weaknesses also creep in as the communication in IVN lacks proper security measures like encryption and authentication. These lack of security measures in IVN makes CAVs vulnerable to cyber-attacks which may have fatal consequences. The de facto standard for communication in IVN is known as Controller Area Network or CAN, and it also lacks said security features to protect CAN from outside threats like cyber attacks, sensor tempering etc. Real-time intrusion detection with minimal computational resources is the need of the hour to prevent disruptive consequences and fatal crashes. In this paper, we propose an intrusion detection method based on Logical Analysis of Data (LAD) which facilitates real-time intrusion detection in CAVs using minimal computational resources. LAD is a two-class classification technique which uses the concept of a partially defined Boolean function (pdBf) to extract different rules for classification from a historical dataset consisting of CAN messages only. Usually, the normal behaviour of any CAV is specified using the extracted rules, and any unusual behaviour that does not conform with the extracted rules is treated as an anomaly. In this paper, we have extracted rules for anomaly and treated all behaviours that do not conform with these extracted rules as normal. The proposed method outperforms many state-of-the-art approaches, which include other rule-based methods, machine learning and deep learning methods both in terms of F1 score and detection time. For CarChallenge 2020 dataset, the proposed method requires lesser than 47.5 μs for detection using a Raspberry Pi device, which is far less than the average time difference between two consecutive CAN messages and thus can be considered as real-time intrusion detection. Real-time intrusion detection is important in preventing any untoward incidents in CAVs. © 2023 Elsevier Inc.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85166525357&doi=10.1016%2fj.vehcom.2023.100652&partnerID=40&md5=ca6349385ed703e27c9360cc942a7fef,Vehicular Communications,2023
"Orientation-Aware Hierarchical, Adaptive-Resolution A Algorithm for UAV Trajectory Planning","Successful path planning for Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) in challenging environments with narrow openings, such as disaster areas, requires attitude to be considered. State-of-the-art methods incorporate attitude only in the refinement stage. We introduce a first-of-a-kind global minimum cost path search method based on A that considers attitude along the path. To make the problem tractable, our method exploits an adaptive and coarse-to-fine approach using global and local A runs, plus an efficient method to introduce the UAV attitude in the process. We integrate our method with an SE(3) trajectory optimisation method based on a safe-flight-corridor, yielding a complete path planning pipeline. Extensive evaluation is undertaken using the AirSim flight simulator under closed loop control in a set of randomised maps, allowing us to quantitatively assess our method. We show that it achieves significantly higher success rates than the baselines, at a reduced computational burden. © 2016 IEEE.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85168663030&doi=10.1109%2fLRA.2023.3308490&partnerID=40&md5=131d593ee0acaad3fd53829b43676337,IEEE Robotics and Automation Letters,2023
DeepManeuver: Adversarial Test Generation for Trajectory Manipulation of Autonomous Vehicles,"Adversarial test generation techniques aim to produce input perturbations that cause a DNN to compute incorrect outputs. For autonomous vehicles driven by a DNN, however, the effect of such perturbations are attenuated by other parts of the system and are less effective as vehicle state evolves. In this work we argue that for adversarial testing perturbations to be effective on autonomous vehicles, they must account for the subtle interplay between the DNN and vehicle states. Building on that insight, we develop DeepManeuver, an automated framework that interleaves adversarial test generation with vehicle trajectory physics simulation. Thus, as the vehicle moves along a trajectory, DeepManeuver enables the refinement of candidate perturbations to: (1) account for changes in the state of the vehicle that may affect how the perturbation is perceived by the system; (2) retain the effect of the perturbation on previous states so that the current state is still reachable and past trajectory is preserved; and (3) result in multi-target maneuvers that require fulfillment of vehicle state sequences (e.g. reaching locations in a road to navigate a tight turn). Our assessment reveals that DeepManeuver can generate perturbations to force maneuvers more effectively and consistently than state-of-the-art techniques by 20.7 percentage points on average. We also show DeepManeuver's effectiveness at disrupting vehicle behavior to achieve multi-target maneuvers with a minimum 52% rate of success.  © 1976-2012 IEEE.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85167811878&doi=10.1109%2fTSE.2023.3301443&partnerID=40&md5=1b36c270d99c8bc49db58ddd31c651d5,IEEE Transactions on Software Engineering,2023
Aerodynamic performance of aircraft wings with stationary vertical lift propellers,"Improvements in battery and motor technology are facilitating innovative aircraft configurations capable of vertical take-off and landing. Of these configurations, lift+cruise is popular for its inherent redundancy and the option to tailor separate propulsion systems for each flight regime. During cruise, the vertical flight propellers of a lift+cruise design are inactive and often exposed. Increasing the projected area of a body is understood to increase the drag, but the aerodynamic performance of an edgewise, stationary propeller and its influence on neighboring bodies is less clear. This study aimed to quantify the impact of two, tandem, edgewise and stationary propellers on the aerodynamic performance of a wing using wind tunnel measurements. The stationary position of the front and rear propellers were varied in 30∘ increments between 0-150∘, at angles of attack between -4∘ and 10∘. Results at Re = 4.3×105 showed the propellers and supporting systems had negligible influence on the lift. However, a drag increase of up to 30% was recorded when propeller positions were aligned perpendicular to the wing chord instead of parallel. Variations in the stationary position of the propeller altered the lift to drag ratio by up to 36% in a typical cruise configuration. © 2023 The Author(s)",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85168413728&doi=10.1016%2fj.ast.2023.108552&partnerID=40&md5=5a5b8cf61e26f93cedfe338307e3d1bd,Aerospace Science and Technology,2023
CARE: Confidence-Rich Autonomous Robot Exploration Using Bayesian Kernel Inference and Optimization,"In this letter, we consider improving the efficiency of information-based autonomous robot exploration in unknown and complex environments. We first utilize Gaussian process (GP) regression to learn a surrogate model to infer the confidence-rich mutual information (CRMI) of querying control actions, then adopt an objective function consisting of predicted CRMI values and prediction uncertainties to conduct Bayesian optimization (BO), i.e., GP-based BO (GPBO). The trade-off between the best action with the highest CRMI value (exploitation) and the action with high prediction variance (exploration) can be realized. To further improve the efficiency of GPBO, we propose a novel lightweight information gain inference method based on Bayesian kernel inference and optimization (BKIO), achieving an approximate logarithmic complexity without the need for training. BKIO can also infer the CRMI and generate the best action using BO with bounded cumulative regret, which ensures its comparable accuracy to GPBO with much higher efficiency. Extensive numerical and real-world experiments show the desired efficiency of our proposed methods without losing exploration performance in different unstructured, cluttered environments. © 2016 IEEE.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85171555965&doi=10.1109%2fLRA.2023.3313054&partnerID=40&md5=acc8f3f20db6e106f1c9fb6190ebfbc1,IEEE Robotics and Automation Letters,2023
AED: An black-box NLP classifier model attacker,"Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) have been successful in solving real-world tasks in domains such as connected and automated vehicles, disease, and job hiring. However, their implications are far-reaching in critical application areas. Hence, there is a growing concern regarding the potential bias and robustness of these DNN models. A transparency and robust model is always demanded in high-stakes domains where reliability and safety are enforced, such as healthcare and finance. While most studies have focused on adversarial image attack scenarios, fewer studies have investigated the robustness of DNN models in natural language processing (NLP) due to their adversarial samples are difficult to generate. To address this gap, we propose a word-level NLP classifier attack model called ”AED,” which stands for Attention mechanism enabled post-model Explanation with Density peaks clustering algorithm for synonyms search and substitution. AED aims to test the robustness of NLP DNN models by interpretability their weaknesses and exploring alternative ways to optimize them. By identifying vulnerabilities and providing explanations, AED can help improve the reliability and safety of DNN models in critical application areas such as healthcare and automated transportation. Our experiment results demonstrate that compared with other existing models, AED can effectively generate adversarial examples that can fool the victim model while maintaining the original meaning of the input. © 2023 Elsevier B.V.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85163840837&doi=10.1016%2fj.neucom.2023.126489&partnerID=40&md5=a284effe776837d5431473d4cc0f49de,Neurocomputing,2023
An adaptive law based online system identification of cropped delta unmanned aerial vehicles from flight tests,"Online system identification of an aircraft has multifaceted advantages, such as real-time health monitoring, fault detection and reconfiguration of control, to name a few. Researchers have utilized variants of the equation error method, which involves non-gradient-based computation to carry out online system identification, due to its feasibility for real-time implementation. However, it was found to be underperforming while handling high angles of attack as well as time-varying bias parameters. In the current manuscript, an attempt has been made to alleviate the aforementioned limitation by proposing a novel online system identification technique based on adaptive law and its applicability is demonstrated by using compatible flight data sets, acquired from two cropped delta wing unmanned aerial vehicles, pertaining to linear, moderately nonlinear, and near stall flight regimes. It is observed that the proposed method is able to predict unknown aerodynamic derivatives, irrespective of flight envelopes, if dynamic modes are adequately excited. Confidence in the estimated aerodynamic parameters is assured with the two-sigma error bound. It is noticed that the maximum relative standard deviation in the estimates obtained with the proposed method is less than the recursive least squares method and higher than the sequential least squares-recursive Fourier transform method in the linear flight regime. Simulated responses using the estimates obtained from aforementioned methods are compared with measured flight data, and it is witnessed that the simulated nondimensional lift coefficient with the proposed method has a relative offset of less than 34.2% w.r.t measured value in near-stall flight regimes, which is least among all three methods. © 2023 Elsevier Masson SAS",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85166305307&doi=10.1016%2fj.ast.2023.108526&partnerID=40&md5=0ee9e393eb2b27d9b3c088e7c20bb32c,Aerospace Science and Technology,2023
MacFormer: Map-Agent Coupled Transformer for Real-Time and Robust Trajectory Prediction,"Predicting the future behavior of agents is a fundamental task in autonomous vehicle domains. Accurate prediction relies on comprehending the surrounding map, which significantly regularizes agent behaviors. However, existing methods have limitations in exploiting the map and exhibit a strong dependence on historical trajectories, which yield unsatisfactory prediction performance and robustness. Additionally, their heavy network architectures impede real-time applications. To tackle these problems, we propose Map-Agent Coupled Transformer (MacFormer) for real-time and robust trajectory prediction. Our framework explicitly incorporates map constraints into the network via two carefully designed modules named coupled map and reference extractor. A novel multi-task optimization strategy (MTOS) is presented to enhance learning of topology and rule constraints. We also devise bilateral query scheme in context fusion for a more efficient and lightweight network. We evaluated our approach on Argoverse 1, Argoverse 2, and nuScenes real-world benchmarks, where it all achieved state-of-the-art performance with the lowest inference latency and smallest model size. Experiments also demonstrate that our framework is resilient to imperfect tracklet inputs.

Computation bits enhancement for IRS-assisted multi-UAV wireless powered mobile edge computing systems,"Mobile edge computing (MEC) and wireless energy transfer are two important paradigms to improve the computation bits and provide more cost-effective energy for low-power internet of things (IoT) devices. However, the performance of energy transfer and task offloading is significantly affected by propagation loss, and hence the links between IoT devices and transmitters are frequently blocked. To address this issue, in this paper, an intelligent reflecting surfaces (IRS) system is utilized to enhance the energy harvesting and task offloading performances in a multi-unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV)-assisted MEC system. Also, a power beacon (PB) is deployed in the coverage area to provide suitable and stable energy for UAVs via a laser charging system. The sum computation bits of all IoT devices are maximized by jointly optimizing transmit power, time allocation, the phase shift in the energy transfer stage, the phase shift in the task offloading stage, CPU frequency of IoT devices, and UAVs' trajectory. An alternate search method (ASM) is proposed to tackle the non-convexity of the formulated problem in which the closed-form expressions of transmit power, time allocation, the phase shift in the task offloading stage, and CPU frequency are derived. Also, the semidefinite relaxation (SDR) approach and successive convex approximation (SCA) methods are exploited to obtain the phase shifts in the energy transfer stage and UAVs' trajectory via CVX optimizer, respectively. The numerical evaluations confirm the performance gain of the proposed IRS-assisted multi-UAV MEC system compared to existing benchmark designs. © 2023 Elsevier Inc.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85168493733&doi=10.1016%2fj.vehcom.2023.100656&partnerID=40&md5=0fe81e31471c56490852e4382df4b0e8,Vehicular Communications,2023
RDMNet: Reliable Dense Matching Based Point Cloud Registration for Autonomous Driving,"Point cloud registration is an important task in robotics and autonomous driving to estimate the ego-motion of the vehicle. Recent advances following the coarse-to-fine manner show promising potential in point cloud registration. However, existing methods rely on good superpoint correspondences, which are hard to be obtained reliably and efficiently, thus resulting in less robust and accurate point cloud registration. In this paper, we propose a novel network, named RDMNet, to find dense point correspondences coarse-to-fine and improve final pose estimation based on such reliable correspondences. Our RDMNet uses a devised 3D-RoFormer mechanism to first extract distinctive superpoints and generates reliable superpoints matches between two point clouds. The proposed 3D-RoFormer fuses 3D position information into the transformer network, efficiently exploiting point clouds' contextual and geometric information to generate robust superpoint correspondences. RDMNet then propagates the sparse superpoints matches to dense point matches using the neighborhood information for accurate point cloud registration. We extensively evaluate our method on multiple datasets from different environments.

A novel and failsafe blockchain framework for secure OTA updates in connected autonomous vehicles,"Connected Autonomous Vehicles (CAVs) are becoming data centers on wheels, amassing petabytes of data. They require a combination of software and hardware systems to operate reliably and simply in real-time. However, due to the transient nature of Vehicle to Vehicle (V2V) and Vehicle to Infrastructure (V2I) networks and CAVs' dependency on a connected software system, we need a new paradigm for secure and immutable data exchange, which emulates smart contracts. For this reason, CAV manufacturers need to maintain the latest version of software to protect CAVs from system failure and cyber threats in real-time, which is difficult with traditional centralized management. The key challenges that we must overcome are the authentication and secure sharing of the Over-The-Air (OTA) software updates and the scalability of distribution at the level of CAVs. This paper proposes a secure and scalable software updates framework in a distributed manner for the CAVs, leveraging Blockchain (BC) with smart contract technology. The framework is able to overcome slow processing speed, which is one of the significant limitations of BC in terms of lower latency and less packet overhead with a high level of security against possible cyber-attacks. We use a salting-based hashing scheme over the traditional Elliptic Curve Cryptography (ECC) Key. This process ensures multi-factor authenticated protection from malicious transactions while downloading and installing any new feature update in CAVs. Moreover, by using Hyperledger BC, our framework provides cost-free transactions while successfully upgrading and deploying OTA software patches in any system of CAVs. This paper extends our previous work [51] by analysing our proposed BC framework's immutability and load management capability. Our simulation results show that our proposed framework is robust, secure, and failsafe for CAV manufacturers and end-users. © 2023 Elsevier Inc.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85168979639&doi=10.1016%2fj.vehcom.2023.100658&partnerID=40&md5=2ce080edde138d38a0e46dcb575a07af,Vehicular Communications,2023
A heterogeneous online/offline signcryption scheme for Internet of Vehicles,"With the rapid development of wireless communication and autonomous driving technologies, the Internet of Vehicles (IoV) technology has emerged to build a large network that supports interactive communication between vehicles, roadside infrastructure and the surrounding environment. This allows vehicle sensors to collect massive amount of data. However, data is at risk of attack. In order to ensure data security, in this paper, we design a heterogeneous online/offline signcryption (HGOOSC) scheme. This construction allows a sender in Certificateless Cryptography (CLC) to send messages to a receiver in Public Key Infrastructure (PKI). CLC has neither key escrow problem in Identity-Based Cryptography (IBC) nor public key certificate management problem in PKI. PKI is widely used in the Internet server to ensure its security. For signcryption, the online/offline technology can save a lot of time compared with the ordinary one. It can preprocess complex operations without the message and the receiver's identity in the offline phase. While in the online phase, it just needs some light operations with the message and the receiver's identity. In addition, the proposed scheme can provide the confidentiality, authentication, integrity and non-repudiation in the random oracle model under the Elliptic Curve Discrete Logarithm Problem (ECDLP). Comprehensive analysis shows that our design is the most efficient. Compared with other three schemes, for offline storage and ciphertext size, our scheme is optimal. For computational cost, our scheme reduces by 23%, 17% and 17%, respectively. Therefore, our design is suitable for the IoV application. © 2023 Elsevier Inc.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85165394393&doi=10.1016%2fj.vehcom.2023.100635&partnerID=40&md5=5d7517fefb47a182aa4ab503c65b1a90,Vehicular Communications,2023
Dynamic Path Planning Algorithm for Unmanned Surface Vehicle under Island-Reef Environment,"The marine environment surrounding islands and reefs exhibit significant time-varying characteristics, which require the path planning algorithm of an unmanned surface vehicle (USV) to have good environmental adaptability. To this end, a dynamic path planning algorithm for USV under an island-reef environment is proposed. The algorithm fully considers these environmental features, such as ocean currents, tides, and winds, to construct an environment model. The environment model is combined with the USV motion model to construct a path planning model under the constraint of environmental disturbance time windows. This approach ensures that the path planning model can adapt to the time-varying marine environment. At the same time, to improve the safety of USV navigation by effectively predicting and timely avoiding passing ships, the velocity obstacle method is introduced for establishing a collision risk assessment model that detects the threat level of passing ships in the vicinity of the USV. Based on the decision-making basis generated by the model, a path replanning model is constructed under the constraint of collision detection time windows. This improves the dynamic collision avoidance capability of the path replanning model. Furthermore, to speed up the solution speed and accuracy of the path planning model and the path replanning model, the multiobjective particle swarm optimization algorithm is improved in three aspects: particle coding method, particle update strategy, and external archive maintenance mechanism. Simulation results show that the algorithm can enable USV to safely avoid multiple close-range dynamic obstacles under maritime rules, while also demonstrating a high level of adaptability to the time-varying marine environment.  © 1965-2011 IEEE.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85163475979&doi=10.1109%2fTAES.2023.3286823&partnerID=40&md5=65e1f7226be88bd24620faf201f72388,IEEE Transactions on Aerospace and Electronic Systems,2023
Bandit-based data poisoning attack against federated learning for autonomous driving models,"In Internet of Things (IoT) applications, federated learning is commonly used for distributedly training models in a privacy-preserving manner. Recently, federated learning is broadly applied to autonomous driving for training intelligent decision models without disseminating local data remotely. Although federated learning provides a safer training manner for protecting data privacy in autonomous driving, the model training process is still vulnerable to poisoning attacks from vehicle client ends. It is beneficial to study poisoning attacks for enhancing the robustness of the training process to generate reliable decisions for safe driving. Until now, a few researches on poisoning attacks against classification models under federated learning scenarios have been proposed. However, those poisoning attacks against classification tasks cannot be directly applied to regression tasks in a federated learning framework, especially autonomous driving tasks such as steering angle control and brake control. The biggest challenge is that the output of non-linear regression models in federated learning is a dynamic sequential value decided by an online updated non-linear function. Thus, minor attacks can affect the overall non-linear function inference outputs leading to a failed stealthy attack. Based on existing challenges, this paper proposes an ATTack against Federated Learning based Autonomous Vehicle framework(ATT_FLAV) to evaluate and enhance the robustness of the federated learning-based autonomous driving models and take the steering angle control task as a representative non-linear regression task to illustrate the methodology. In the proposed framework, a bandit-based AttackRegion-UCB (AR-UCB) algorithm is designed for dynamic data poisoning attacks against the non-linear regression model. This is a black-box attack strategy that chooses the target attack label region dynamically in each federated learning round based on historical attack experiences. Compared with the attack performance of baseline poisoning attacks and the robustness under defense schemas, the proposed poisoning attack strategy can achieve superior attack performance via continuous data poisoning attacks against the federated learning framework. © 2023",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85157963087&doi=10.1016%2fj.eswa.2023.120295&partnerID=40&md5=726a36a65c1f0ef0e812e0117797a036,Expert Systems with Applications,2023
Dynamic UAV Swarm Confrontation: An Imitation Based on Mobile Adaptive Networks,"Cooperative unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) swarms could expand the mission capability of the single UAV and the overall combat effectiveness. We consider the dynamic scenarios where an UAV swarm confronts multiple maneuvering high-value targets (HVTs) and multiple maneuvering attackers. In such hostile scenarios, each UAV of the UAV swarm would generally strive to survive through collaboratively offending their opponents and self-defense from potential attacks. We consider modeling UAV swarms as biologically inspired mobile adaptive networks to imitate the dynamic confrontations of UAV swarms. It is essential to develop an efficient motion control mechanism underpinned by both target tracking and decision making so as to enhance the capability of UAV swarms. We formulate a distributed modularized framework incorporating collaboratively tracking multiple opponents, making successive and prompt decisions, and controlling motion mechanism for mobile adaptive networks. We develop the diffusion multitask interactive Kalman filter to efficiently track multiple preys (HVTs) and multiple predators (attackers). We further develop the collaborative decision making on prey pursuit or predator evasion such that each UAV would acquire early warnings and predictions of the most hypothetically threatening predators to enhance the effectiveness of self-defense. Moreover, we develop a composite motion control mechanism, such that each UAV would be steered toward the prey or away from any approaching predator in a self-organized manner at a variable speed. The modular design of the proposed framework would promote the affordability and adaptability of UAV swarms. Illustrative simulation results validate the efficacy of the proposed distributed framework and the underlying algorithms.  © 1965-2011 IEEE.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85162881420&doi=10.1109%2fTAES.2023.3288077&partnerID=40&md5=6008b2f9ca4a672b03dc4fbe1db73e56,IEEE Transactions on Aerospace and Electronic Systems,2023
Numerical study on hydrodynamic performance of an underwater propulsive wing propulsor,"The propulsive wing has an excellent aerodynamic performance due to boundary layer control. When propulsive wings are applied to unmanned underwater vehicles (UUVs), high hydrodynamic forces in both the horizontal and vertical directions significantly enhance UUV maneuverability. To investigate the hydrodynamic performance of a propulsive wing propulsor (PWP), the underwater flow field of the PWP is numerically simulated. The hydrodynamic performance of the PWP is subjected to comprehensive investigation in terms of its hydrodynamic efficiency, unsteady force, and wake evolution. A three-dimensional simulation is undertaken to briefly analyze spanwise effects on PWP hydrodynamic performance. The results show that the PWP delivers an excellent hydrodynamic performance with high hydrodynamic coefficients, where power load and propulsive efficiency before stall reach 4.4 and 0.23, respectively. The convergence of blade-shedding vortices at the bottom of the deflector provides vortex-induced lift but leads to high-frequency and high-amplitude fluctuations in PWP hydrodynamic forces. The amplitudes of the fluctuations are closely correlated to the vorticities of the blade-shedding vortices. The three-dimensional simulation results show that, before stall, spanwise effects on PWP hydrodynamic forces and the wake structure are limited. © 2023",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85164339679&doi=10.1016%2fj.oceaneng.2023.115293&partnerID=40&md5=75d6338dd93c5839c634465f507ee438,Ocean Engineering,2023
Threat potential field based Pursuit–Evasion Games for underactuated Unmanned Surface Vehicles,"Unmanned Surface Vehicles (USVs) have been widely applied in ocean engineering. However, there are few studies for Pursuit–Evasion Game based on USVs. Most relevant pursuit game strategies based on nonrepresentational agents are simple and do not consider the USV's underactuation. In order to solve this problem, this paper proposes a distributed pursuit game algorithm for USVs based on Threat potential fields (TPFs). The pursuit planning can be divided into three parts based on algorithm structure: First, according to the evader's information, the proposed algorithm can quantitatively establish a unique TPF for evaluating the danger of the evader. Second, in the TPF, energy peak and energy valley concepts are innovatively presented to provide suitable conditions for the hunters’ pursuit. Third, the pursuit game optimization model is established based on a TPF for the hunters’ game decision-making by considering the orientation, heading, and formation shape of the USVs in the pursuit process. The proposed game optimization model is then solved using the particle swarm optimization algorithm to obtain the strategies. Finally, the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm is demonstrated via numeric simulation of USVs. © 2023 Elsevier Ltd",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85165315314&doi=10.1016%2fj.oceaneng.2023.115381&partnerID=40&md5=4daea6608263f1a5690ae2f0ae673a1d,Ocean Engineering,2023
Secure Consensus of Multiagent Systems with DoS Attacks via Fully Distributed Dynamic Event-Triggered Control,"This article investigates the secure consensus problem of general linear multiagent systems with denial-of-service (DoS) attacks. Owning to the existence of DoS attacks, it is challenging to investigate the event-triggered control of multiagent systems in a fully distributed manner. This article presents a novel dynamic event-triggered mechanism to alleviate the limited communication resources. Moreover, the designed mechanism is fully distributed and scalable owing to the introduction of some adaptive coupling weights. Since the DoS attacks have been considered in the event-triggered rule design, a novel adaptive parameter with an additional exponential term is adopted to deal with DoS attacks. The Lyapunov design also introduces such a term for the subsequent stability analysis. Sufficient conditions guaranteeing the asymptotic consensus of the studied system are developed in light of the controller's parameters, duration, and frequency of the DoS attacks. Strict proof is provided to demonstrate that a secure consensus can be reached effectively under the proposed control mechanism. Furthermore, it is shown that the Zeno behavior can be excluded from the designed triggering mechanism. Finally, simulations on a multiagent system consisting of interconnected unmanned intelligent vehicles are conducted to verify the results.  © 2013 IEEE.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85163431749&doi=10.1109%2fTSMC.2023.3283969&partnerID=40&md5=a457874622a510749ba99782d152ea1c,"IEEE Transactions on Systems, Man, and Cybernetics: Systems",2023
L-Shape-Model-Based Vehicle Tracking With Joint Kinematic and Geometric Estimation Using Lidar,"In this article, the problem of tracking vehicles using lidar sensors mounted on an ego-vehicle is addressed. Due to line-of-sight limitations, the back (or front) of a vehicle as seen by the lidar on the ego-vehicle behind (or ahead of) it is often modeled as L-shaped. In this article, an L-shape-based vehicle tracking algorithm with joint kinematic and geometric estimation is presented. By feeding back tracking results to L-shape fitting, an L-shape detection method that is robust to outliers is proposed. In the L-shape tracker currently available in the literature, the kinematic and geometric states of the L-shape model are separately estimated and maintained. However, the kinematic and geometric states are not independent since the orientation of a vehicle influences its velocity. Also, the dependence between the kinematic and the geometric states is caused by anchor-point (the closest point on the vehicle being tracked) switching, which is required during changes in the relative position between vehicles. To address this limitation, the proposed L-shape tracker exploits this dependence and estimates the kinematic and geometric states jointly. The proposed L-shape-model-based tracking algorithm is evaluated and compared with the original algorithm using the real traffic data from the KITTI datasets. The results demonstrate the superiority of the proposed algorithm over the original algorithm in terms of L-shape detection and tracking accuracies. © 2023 IEEE.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85159719657&doi=10.1109%2fTAES.2023.3267763&partnerID=40&md5=532eb2da23ac40ba3115798d949df16a,IEEE Transactions on Aerospace and Electronic Systems,2023
Toward Optimal Deployment of UAV Relays in UAV-Assisted Internet of Vehicles,"The past decade has witnessed an explosive growth of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), which have attracted great attention in assisting Internet of Vehicles (IoV) communication systems thanks to the advantages of cost-effectiveness, high maneuverability, and flexible deployment. Yet several issues, such as UAVs' transmit power and energy resources as well as the high-speed mobility of IoV user equipment (VUE), pose challenges to the development of UAVs in UAV-assisted IoV. To provide reliable and high-throughput wireless links for VUEs in a given ground area, this article considers a scenario in which a ground VUE is facing difficulties in receiving service from a ground roadside unit (RSU) owing to possible sudden RSU malfunction or poor signal coverage. In this case, UAVs are generally deployed in the air, serving as relays to establish communication links between uncovered VUE and the neighboring RSU. To maximize the system capacity, we investigate the deployment problem of UAV relays under single-UAV relaying and multi-UAV relaying cases upon considering VUE mobility, and exploit the optimal deployment strategy of UAV relays under fixed total power consumption. Comprehensive simulation results verify that the proposed algorithm can outperform benchmark methods on significant critical indicators such as the average achievable user rate, and the outage probability. Also, evaluations and analyses have highlighted the effects of key system parameters (e.g., altitude, number, and transmit power of UAV relays) on optimal UAV relay deployment position and system performance.  © 1967-2012 IEEE.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85159818410&doi=10.1109%2fTVT.2023.3272648&partnerID=40&md5=b991c18eaf4ebce5338e4b3d50f2cd01,IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology,2023
A Protocol for Reliable Real-Time Wireless Communication of Large Data Samples,"In this article, we present a middleware protocol, that transmits larger-than-a-frame data samples within application real-time and reliability requirements over a lossy wireless channel. The protocol efficiently deploys an intelligent retransmission control that exploits the extended deadline requirements of a sample for frame-level scheduling. The transmission of such samples is placed in the context of the necessary integration of such external sensor data into the decision-making process of an autonomous vehicle. Therefore, we provide parameterization and access rules for communication links in resource-managed scenarios and lay out how to integrate the protocol into the popular DDS middleware. The performance of the parameterized links to satisfy their reliability requirements is studied and compared to error protection protocols in the current software stack. We base the evaluation on an OMNeT++ simulation, whereby an established wireless error model is used. The use case is placed in the context of collaborative sensing in a valet parking environment, where external infrastructure sensor data augments the autonomous vehicle's data processing chain via a lossy wireless link. Thereby, the use case adheres to the underlying safety requirements. Results show that if the protocol's awareness of the application requirements is used for parameterization, guarantees for reliability can be provided that outperform existing solutions. © 1967-2012 IEEE.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85159834674&doi=10.1109%2fTVT.2023.3275300&partnerID=40&md5=4f48c3d53e815ea072798ff323a8b9b2,IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology,2023
Unmanned-Aerial-Vehicle-Aided Integrated Sensing and Computation with Mobile-Edge Computing,"Integrated sensing and communication (ISAC), which enables the joint radar sensing and data communications, shows its great potential in many intelligent applications. In this article, we investigate the unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV)-aided ISAC with mobile-edge computing (MEC), where the ISAC device deployed on the UAV senses multiple targets with the sensing scheduling and offloads the radar sensing data to the edge-server to train a machine learning model for target recognition. The radar estimation information rate is utilized to measure the radar sensing performance. We aim to minimize a systemwise cost that includes both the UAV's energy consumption and the data collecting time, while satisfying the requirements on both the model training error and the radar sensing performance. We formulate a joint optimization problem of the sensing scheduling, the number of time-slots, the sensing power, the communication power, and the UAV trajectory. Despite the strict nonconvexity of the formulated problem, we propose an efficient algorithm for solving it. Our algorithm jointly leverages the vertical decomposition that exploits the layered structure of the formulated problem and the horizontal decomposition that utilizes the block coordinate descent (BCD) method.

A Repeated Unknown Game: Decentralized Task Offloading in Vehicular Fog Computing,"Offloading computation to nearby edge/fog computing nodes, including the ones carried by moving vehicles, e.g., vehicular fog nodes (VFN), has proved to be a promising approach for enabling low-latency and compute-intensive mobility applications, such as cooperative and autonomous driving. This work considers vehicular fog computing scenarios where the clients of computation offloading services try to minimize their own costs while deciding which VFNs to offload their tasks. We focus on decentralized multi-agent decision-making in a repeated unknown game where each agent, e.g., service client, can observe only its own action and realized cost. In other words, each agent is unaware of the game composition or even the existence of opponents. We apply a completely uncoupled learning rule to generalize the decentralized decision-making algorithm presented in [7] for the multi-agent case. The multi-agent solution proposed in this work can capture the unknown offloading cost variations susceptive to resource congestion under an adversarial framework where each agent may take implicit cost estimation and suitable resource choice adapting to the dynamics associated with volatile supply and demand. According to the evaluation via simulation, this work reveals that such individual perturbations for robustness to uncertainty and adaptation to dynamicity ensure a certain level of optimality in terms of social welfare, e.g., converging the actual sequence of play with unknown and asymmetric attributes and lowering the correspondent cost in social welfare due to the self-interested behaviors of agents. © 1967-2012 IEEE.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85159800796&doi=10.1109%2fTVT.2023.3275120&partnerID=40&md5=3b6c7a5e47dd572a5abf18d9c2472883,IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology,2023
UAV Target Detection for IoT via Enhancing ERP Component by Brain-Computer Interface System,"The increasing popularity of Internet of Things (IoT) devices provides a huge data source for intelligent identification. Images captured by the unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) are often exploited in target detection missions for search, rescue and fire prevention. However, without sufficient training samples, the machine learning method is usually difficult to meet application requirements. To solve the problem, a brain-computer interface (BCI) real-time system is applied to UAV target detection. In this study, a novel rapid serial visual presentation (RSVP) paradigm was formulated to present images, enhancing the ability for wide-area target detection. Since there is spatial correlation in captured images, joint decision for identical target can improve the recognition efficiency. To suppress interfering components and improve event-related potential (ERP) detection efficiency, an enhancing ERP component (EEC) algorithm is proposed. Both decision method and EEC algorithm are based on strictly statistical theory. RSVP task was performed by 12 subjects. The interference components and noise correlation were significantly reduced by the EEC algorithm. The target detection rate online was 86.6% while the false alarm rate was less than 5%. Besides, the joint decision strategy raised the area under curve (AUC) value from 0.876 to 0.963. The proposed BCI real-time system realizes the complementarity of human intelligence and IoT, ushering UAV target detection into the era of hybrid intelligence. © 2014 IEEE.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85159794062&doi=10.1109%2fJIOT.2023.3273163&partnerID=40&md5=cfd4bf54373231c0c8d1b3744a0e8491,IEEE Internet of Things Journal,2023
Achieving optimal-dynamic path planning for unmanned surface vehicles: A rational multi-objective approach and a sensory-vector re-planner,"Navigating unmanned surface vehicles (USVs) in the intricate and unpredictable oceanic environment poses an indispensable challenge for path planning, necessitating meticulous strategies and unwavering resolve. In this paper, under complex and unforeseen circumstances, a novel path planning framework incorporating the multi-objective optimization and a sensory-vector replanning strategy is created for a USV. First, by encapsulating the intricate nature of ocean environment and ship dynamics, a nonlinear multi-objective path planning problem is designed, thereby providing a comprehensive and in-depth portrayal of the underlying mechanism. By integrating the principles of candidate set random testing and adaptive crowding distance, an adaptive enhanced non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm (AENSGA-II) is devised to fully exploit the underlying optimization problem in constrained dynamics. To avoid over-subjective choice in the Pareto set, a fuzzy-linguistic satisfactory degree is deliberately designed, where the linguistic importance preference of the objectives is re-evaluated in the Pareto set, facilitating the decision-making. By inserting virtual sensory vector onto the USV, a seamless interface between global planning and COLREG-compliant replanning mechanism is devised, thereby contributing to the entire hierarchical scheme. Eventually, the framework merits autonomous global-planning and local-reaction in an organically way. Comprehensive simulations and comparisons in various ocean scenarios demonstrate the effectiveness and superiority of the proposed path planning framework. © 2023 Elsevier Ltd",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85169557929&doi=10.1016%2fj.oceaneng.2023.115433&partnerID=40&md5=3d099a71115570e7362ef478918e67f8,Ocean Engineering,2023
Coordinated Hierarchical Co-Optimization of Speed Planning and Energy Management for Electric Vehicles Driving in Stochastic Environment,"Active co-optimization of future speed profiles together with powertrain control is the optimal solution to further exploiting the energy benefit of electric vehicles (EVs) in real-world operation. However, with uncertainties in driving conditions and concerns about driving safety, speed planning results are cautious and with frequent speed variations, which deteriorates the energy economy of EVs in turn. To comprehensively optimize the energy economy and driving safety of EVs in a stochastic driving environment, this article develops a chance constraint model predictive control (CC-MPC) for co-optimizing the speed planning and powertrain control, which forms an advanced energy management method. To handle the instantaneous disturbance, a coordinated hierarchical method (CHM) is engineered for solving the CC-MPC. As suggested by simulation, the driving safety (measured by success rate) can be increased to 81% with the CC-MPC, which realizes a 62% improvement compared with situations without CC-MPC. Moreover, the proposed CC-MPC significantly mitigates the conflict between driving safety and the energy economy, and the worst deterioration of the energy economy is only 9.3%. Sacrificing merely 2.1% sub-optimality, CHM removes 86% computation loads, and the median of CPU time is merely 0.58s at each computation step (control interval 1s), which makes the CC-MPC promising for online implementation. © 1967-2012 IEEE.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85159793310&doi=10.1109%2fTVT.2023.3275583&partnerID=40&md5=36be9030facc562b9b3bcd55716a7499,IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology,2023
Robust Adversarial Attacks Detection Based on Explainable Deep Reinforcement Learning for UAV Guidance and Planning,"The dangers of adversarial attacks on Uncrewed Aerial Vehicle (UAV) agents operating in public are increasing. Adopting AI-based techniques and, more specifically, Deep Learning (DL) approaches to control and guide these UAVs can be beneficial in terms of performance but can add concerns regarding the safety of those techniques and their vulnerability against adversarial attacks. Confusion in the agent's decision-making process caused by these attacks can seriously affect the safety of the UAV. This article proposes an innovative approach based on the explainability of DL methods to build an efficient detector that will protect these DL schemes and the UAVs adopting them from attacks. The agent adopts a Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) scheme for guidance and planning. The agent is trained with a Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient (DDPG) with Prioritised Experience Replay (PER) DRL scheme that utilises Artificial Potential Field (APF) to improve training times and obstacle avoidance performance. A simulated environment for UAV explainable DRL-based planning and guidance, including obstacles and adversarial attacks, is built. The adversarial attacks are generated by the Basic Iterative Method (BIM) algorithm and reduced obstacle course completion rates from 97% to 35%. Two adversarial attack detectors are proposed to counter this reduction. The first one is a Convolutional Neural Network Adversarial Detector (CNN-AD), which achieves accuracy in the detection of 80%. The second detector utilises a Long Short Term Memory (LSTM) network. It reaches an accuracy of 91% with faster computing times compared to the CNN-AD, allowing for real-time adversarial detection.  © 2016 IEEE.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85165326408&doi=10.1109%2fTIV.2023.3296227&partnerID=40&md5=600b31c860f643e4c46b2fb9beaecac5,IEEE Transactions on Intelligent Vehicles,2023
UAV Path Planning for Target Coverage Task in Dynamic Environment,"Exploiting the possibility of an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) as a powerful tool for the Internet of Things applications, such as intelligent agricultural monitoring, intelligent transportation monitoring, etc., has gradually become a hot research topic at home and abroad. While some optimization algorithms have been devised to plan the flight route of UAVs, there are still some problems with the feasibility and effectiveness of these algorithms. This article presents a solution to the UAV path planning problem for target coverage task in a dynamic environment. The methodology applies a greedy allocation strategy for task assignment and an improved ant colony optimization algorithm based on variable pheromone (ACO-VP) for path planning. First, we specify the optimal number of UAVs for the task and allocate target points to each UAV, through the greedy allocation strategy. Then, to improve the efficiency of path planning, we adjust the pheromone update rule by introducing a variable pheromone enhancement factor and a variable pheromone evaporation coefficient into the ant colony optimization (ACO) algorithm. Moreover, paths are replanned when the coverage task changes due to the increase of new target points. This method is verified through simulations and compared with other algorithms. The results show that the ACO-VP algorithm is more efficient and effective for UAV path planning than others.  © 2014 IEEE.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85160226813&doi=10.1109%2fJIOT.2023.3277850&partnerID=40&md5=c64951f321204d3b5ae3bf071ec3b59d,IEEE Internet of Things Journal,2023
Trustworthy Sensor Fusion Against Inaudible Command Attacks in Advanced Driver-Assistance Systems,"There are increasing concerns about malicious attacks on autonomous vehicles. In particular, inaudible voice command attacks pose a significant threat as voice commands become available in autonomous driving systems. How to empirically defend against these inaudible attacks remains an open question. Previous research investigates utilizing deep learning-based multimodal fusion for defense, without considering the model uncertainty in trustworthiness. As deep learning has been applied to increasingly sensitive tasks, uncertainty measurement is crucial in helping improve model robustness, especially in mission-critical scenarios. In this article, we propose the multimodal fusion framework (MFF) as an intelligent security system to defend against inaudible voice command attacks. MFF fuses heterogeneous audio-vision modalities using VGG family neural networks and achieves the detection accuracy of 92.25% in the comparative fusion method empirical study. Additionally, extensive experiments on audio-vision tasks reveal the model's uncertainty. Using expected calibration errors, we measure calibration errors and Monte Carlo Dropout to estimate the predictive distribution for the proposed models. Our findings show empirically to train robust multimodal models, improve standard accuracy and provide a further step toward interpretability.

Robust Localization for Secure Navigation of UAV Formations Under GNSS Spoofing Attack,"Nowadays, aerial formations are frequently employed in outdoor scenarios to cooperatively explore and monitor wide areas of interest. In these applications, the vehicles are often exposed to relevant security vulnerabilities, as, for instance, the alteration of navigation signals from an attacker with map counterfeiting (if not even hijacking) purposes. In this work, we focus on an Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) formation that monitors an area, wherein navigation spoofing attacks may occur. Letting the UAVs cooperate and exploiting the redundancy in the available sensing information, a distributed procedure is proposed to i ) detect spoofing attacks, and ii ) support the navigation in adverse conditions. The validity of the designed approach is confirmed by numerical results. Aerial vehicles for outdoor operation are generally endowed with inertial measurements, relative ranging, and GNSS sensing capability. In this work, two cascaded estimation algorithms for concurrent GNSS spoofing detection and localization in a multi-UAV scenario is proposed, to attain robust navigation in areas subject to GNSS spoofing attacks. The attack detection leverages on information theoretic tools to provide a practical threshold test by checking the multimodal measurement consistency. The localization procedures exploit a decision logic relying on measurement reliability to combine information sources that are different in nature, for UAV self-localization in both safe and under-attack conditions.

The localization procedures exploit a decision logic relying on measurement reliability to combine information sources that are different in nature, for UAV self-localization in both safe and under-attack conditions.  © 2004-2012 IEEE.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85139494834&doi=10.1109%2fTASE.2022.3208662&partnerID=40&md5=6c8fcea099c51793677ce7995afc6d47,IEEE Transactions on Automation Science and Engineering,2023
Energy-Efficient General PoI-Visiting by UAV with a Practical Flight Energy Model,"Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) are being widely exploited for various applications, e.g., traversing to collect data from ground sensors, patrolling to monitor key facilities, moving to aid mobile edge computing. We summarize these UAV applications and formulate a problem, namely the general waypoint-based PoI-visiting problem. Since energy is critical due to the limited onboard storage capacity, we aim at minimizing flight energy consumption. In our problem, we pay special attention to the energy consumption for turning and switching operations on flight planning, which are usually ignored in the literature but play an important role in practical UAV flights according to our real-world measurement experiments. We propose specially designed graph parts to model the turning and switching cost and thus transfer the problem into a classic graph problem, i.e., general traveling salesman problem, which can be efficiently solved. Theoretical analysis shows that such problem transformation has the graph redefinition approximation ratio upper bound, max{ Θ /Δ,2max{Θ/δ,2}, where ΘΘ is related to the designed graph parts and Δδ is a constant. Finally, we evaluate our proposed algorithm by simulations. The results show that it costs less than 107% of the optimal minimum energy consumption for small scale problems and costs only 50% as much energy as a naive algorithm for large scale problems.  © 2002-2012 IEEE.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85136846237&doi=10.1109%2fTMC.2022.3199237&partnerID=40&md5=c199b00ecbfd29ea06bb16715233fc1c,IEEE Transactions on Mobile Computing,2023
Data Freshness Optimization Under CAA in the UAV-Aided MECN: A Potential Game Perspective,"As a promising enabler for edge intelligence, Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAV) have become more and more important in Mobile Edge Computing Networks (MECN), such as communication, computation, collection and control service supply. Although Age of Information (AoI) minimization is indispensable for fresh information collection and computation in the UAV-aided MECN, some attackers can launch attacks to deteriorate the availability of precious channel resources, such as revealed channel access attacks (CAAs). Moreover, recent research has not considered the system's active probability and security issues concurrently, e.g., CAA, in the average AoI minimization process. In this paper, to deal with this problem, we consider an AoI-oriented channel access problem under CAA with a game theory viewpoint. Firstly, to obtain a MECN-based AoI indicator under CAA, the system model with active probability consideration is established. Next, the channel access-based AoI minimization problem is formulated from the viewpoint of the Ordinary Potential Game (OPG). Furthermore, two algorithms called AACSD and DCASD are proposed to determine channel access strategies, by which the Nash Equilibrium (NE) solution of the OPG could be reached. Finally, experiments are conducted under homogeneous and heterogeneous parameter settings, and the simulation results evaluate the correctness and effectiveness of our proposals. © 2000-2011 IEEE.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85129358782&doi=10.1109%2fTITS.2022.3167485&partnerID=40&md5=66b9bc68508ed0fa09c02736745b0ab3,IEEE Transactions on Intelligent Transportation Systems,2023
Attribute-Based Data Sharing Scheme with Flexible Search Functionality for Cloud-Assisted Autonomous Transportation System,"The existing group public key encryption with equality test schemes could only support one-to-one data sharing and are not suitable for cloud-assisted autonomous transportation systems, which demand one-to-many data sharing. To tackle this problem efficiently, in this article, we put forward the group-attribute-based encryption with equality test (G-ABEET) scheme. The presented G-ABEET allows sensors equipped in vehicles to encrypt traffic data with an expressive access policy before sharing it. Only users with attributes required by the access policy ought to access the shared ciphertexts, thus achieving selective one-to-many data sharing. Meanwhile, the authorized cloud server could provide group users with equality tests over the ciphertexts, realizing ciphertext search ability. Furthermore, with the group mechanism, the G-ABEET scheme could resist offline message recovery attacks. Besides, in the standard model, we give rigorous security proof of the G-ABEET construction. The feasibility and efficiency of G-ABEET are demonstrated by experimental simulations. © 2005-2012 IEEE.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85148475230&doi=10.1109%2fTII.2023.3242815&partnerID=40&md5=71d50d0b0f201a1fbb703c680a39be0b,IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics,2023
Effects of vehicle dynamics on small UAS-gust encounters,"This study investigates the relative impacts of different gusts on representative small Uncrewed Air Systems through the use of a simple analytical model. The model uses basic vehicle characteristics, including planform area and mass, to account for the altitude gained during gust interactions. This is a missing component from most current fundamental gust studies, both experimental and numerical. The results show that the induced negative effective angle of attack created by the vertical motion of the vehicle has a significant countering effect on the gust and suggests that this effective angle of attack should be accounted for in future gust studies. Efforts are undertaken to determine the relative importance of accounting for this motion. This is done by investigating the impact of the induced negative angle of attack on the altitude trajectory. An equation is found using gust and vehicle characteristics to determine the critical gust ratio at a given gust development rate, which is the minimum gust ratio which will lead to vehicle stall. Lastly, an empirical relationship is derived to allow for the effective gust ratio conversion between fixed-model experiments and flying-vehicle gust interactions. © 2023",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85174582802&doi=10.1016%2fj.ast.2023.108679&partnerID=40&md5=c748f1cf6ac5e3f44fcd9f25c8cc2a01,Aerospace Science and Technology,2023
Lightweight and Bilateral Controllable Data Sharing for Secure Autonomous Vehicles Platooning Service,"Autonomous vehicle platoons are emerging as a promising solution to modern urban governance challenges, such as traffic congestion, air pollution, and fuel waste. As a data-driven paradigm, ensuring secure data sharing is a key challenge for autonomous vehicle platoon applications. However, existing research on secure data sharing of autonomous vehicles platoon suffers from practical weaknesses such as privacy leakage, lack of flexible data source identification, and inefficiency. Motivated by that, this article first proposes the LFBA scheme, which is the first fine-grained data sharing framework that supports bilateral access control and access policy hiding with lightweight and almost constant computational and storage resources consumption, this can be owed to the sophisticated algorithm structure we designed. We then construct an edge-Assisted deployment model over LFBA (EA-LFBA) to further improve efficiency and security against common attacks. We then provide the security proof for LFBA, and security analysis for EA-LFBA.

Data harvesting in uncharted waters: Interactive learning empowered path planning for USV-assisted maritime data collection under fully unknown environments,"Unleashing the potential of unmanned surface vehicles (USVs) for Underwater Internet-of-Things (UIoT) brings forth a vigorous new frontier, unlocking the innovative insights and paving the way towards the era of Smart Ocean. By leveraging the power of USVs, this paper dives into the path planning problem in oceanic data collection, particularly in fully unknown environments. First, by encapsulating the intricacies of USV-sensor communication channel and obstacle avoidance mechanism, a novel path planning model for data collection is meticulously formulated, providing a comprehensive and in-depth portrayal of the underlying dynamics. Secondly, integrating an environmental updating mechanism, an interactive learning approach is intentionally developed to enable USVs to fully exploit and explore the dynamic environments, employing a heuristically defined reward function to generate optimal waypoint sequence for USVs. Catering to the non-holonomic nature of USVs, the fast-discrete Clothoid path is introduced to formulate the USVs’ trajectories, whereby smooth maneuvering is achieved by governing feasible actions under kinematic constraints, maintaining the continuous alteration of curvature and course at turning points. The convergence capability of the method is proved both theoretically and demonstrated numerically. Extensive simulation and comparative evaluations under complex oceanic environments showcase its strong practical applicability, thereby demonstrating the promising potential of this approach in unlocking new opportunities for innovation and exploration in UIoT. © 2023 Elsevier Ltd",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85171143372&doi=10.1016%2fj.oceaneng.2023.115781&partnerID=40&md5=bcd3333887ea06023f89cbf73a48d28d,Ocean Engineering,2023
A Differential Fault Attack on Security Vehicle System Applied SIMON Block Cipher,"With the application of new technologies in vehicles such as wireless communications, microelectronics, Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Autonomous Vehicles (AV), there are lots of embedded hardware and software in vehicles, and so cryptographic technologies such as block ciphers are also applied to the vehicle system to protect its security and privacy. In order to better find potential security vulnerabilities and improve security of the vehicle system which applied SIMON block cipher, in this paper, a novel Differential fault attack (DFA) method is presented. By inducing a random bit fault in LT-4 (the fourth round from the last), we first demonstrate the process of identifying the fault-induced position. Then, on the basis of the determined position, we describe how to retrieve three rounds of keys by inducing only one round of faults. For retrieving the SIMON family, compared with previous DFAs under the random bit fault model, the lowest numbers of fault-induced and fault locations (or rounds) are required by our attack. In particular, when the key words m is 2 or 3, the proposed attack only needs to induce one round of faults. Finally, we carry out simulation verification and a comparison to illustrate the correctness and effectiveness of the proposed attack.  © 2000-2011 IEEE.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85127064170&doi=10.1109%2fTITS.2022.3157955&partnerID=40&md5=1c611a0a0ae74d99d7da78f116a86c0f,IEEE Transactions on Intelligent Transportation Systems,2023
Resilient Path Planning of Unmanned Aerial Vehicles Against Covert Attacks on Ultrawideband Sensors,"In this article, a resilient path planning scheme is proposed to navigate an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) to its planned (nominal) destination with minimum energy consumption in the presence of a strategic attacker. The UAV is equipped with the following two sensors: 1) a GPS sensor, which is vulnerable to spoofing attacks; 2) a well-functioning ultrawideband (UWB) sensor, which is possible to be deceived. It is shown that a covert attacker can significantly deviate the UAV's path without being detected by the UWB sensor by simultaneously corrupting the GPS signals and forging control inputs. The prerequisite for the attack occurrence is first discussed. Based on this prerequisite, an optimal attack scheme is proposed, which maximizes the deviation between the nominal destination and the real one. Correspondingly, an energy-efficient and resilient navigation scheme based on Pontryagin's maximum principle is formulated, which suppresses the above covert attacker effectively. Essentially, this problem can be seen as a Stackelberg game between a resilient path planner (defender) and a covert attacker. The effectiveness of our theoretical results is illustrated via two simulation examples.  © 2005-2012 IEEE.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85148415698&doi=10.1109%2fTII.2023.3240595&partnerID=40&md5=123f5324ca1689a7541405a7fa5b3cf6,IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics,2023
Distributed cooperative search method for multi-UAV with unstable communications,"In search-attack and search-rescue tasks performed by multiple unmanned aerial vehicles (multi-UAV), cooperative search plays an important part. The majority of approaches in use today assume that the UAV swarm's communication network is complete. However, these links are susceptible to environmental changes or adversary interference. Aiming at cooperative search in search-attack and search-rescue tasks, we propose a distributed cooperative search method for multi-UAV with unstable communications (DCS-UC), which is developed based on ant colony optimization (ACO). The proposed method presents three algorithms to enable the UAV swarm to conduct online cooperative search efficiently and safely. First, a pheromone matrix consensus update technique for usage in ACO is designed under switching and connected topology graphs. This approach can help each UAV's pheromone matrix achieve consensus, improving the UAV swarm's cooperative efficiency. Then, a position consensus update algorithm is presented where the position vector, including the positions of all the UAVs in each UAV, can achieve consensus under switching and connected topology graphs. Finally, a collision avoidance algorithm is developed using the determined consistent positions of all the UAVs to address the issue of collision avoidance for all the UAVs. This approach enables the UAV swarm to conduct cooperative search safely. Results from extensive physical simulations performed in Gazebo confirm the benefits of the proposed multi-UAV cooperative search method. © 2023",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85174400377&doi=10.1016%2fj.asoc.2023.110592&partnerID=40&md5=225c8cac54ae61071bf41b532d5db8d9,Applied Soft Computing,2023
Perceptual Interaction-Based Path Tracking Control of Autonomous Vehicles under DoS Attacks: A Reinforcement Learning Approach,"This paper considers the distributed optimal path tracking control problem of autonomous ground vehicles (AGVs) with matched uncertainties under denial-of-service (DoS) attacks. First, to solve the uncertain system parameters, an inverse reinforcement learning (RL) technique is PROPOSED to seek the optimal controller instead of directly solving the robust control problem, which can ensure that the designed controller is globally optimal with respect to the proposal performance function. An off-policy RL algorithm is further proposed to learn the optimal control solution online without requiring any knowledge of the vehicle dynamics. Then, to lower the communication load among vehicles, a perception-based optimal resilient controller and its corresponding perception-based static deadband condition are developed, respectively. Moreover, the perception-based dynamic deadband control mechanism is further exploited to consider the secure path tracking control problem. The proposed algorithms verify that the RL-based optimal path tracking control can be solved, and the occurrence of the Zeno phenomenon can be avoided. Finally, a numerical simulation is demonstrated to verify the effectiveness of the proposed approach.  © 1967-2012 IEEE.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85162897678&doi=10.1109%2fTVT.2023.3287272&partnerID=40&md5=183a8cb2848aa028d730027c2a829a5a,IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology,2023
UAV Trajectory and Multi-User Beamforming Optimization for Clustered Users Against Passive Eavesdropping Attacks with Unknown CSI,"This article tackles the fundamental passive eavesdropping problem in modern wireless communications in which the location and the channel state information (CSI) of the attackers are unknown. In this regard, we propose deploying an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) that serves as a mobile aerial relay (AR) to help ground base station (GBS) support a subset of vulnerable users. More precisely, our solution (1) clusters the single-Antenna users in two groups to be either served by the GBS directly or via the AR, (2) employs optimal multi-user beamforming to the directly served users, and (3) optimizes the AR's 3D position, its multi-user beamforming matrix and transmit powers by combining closed-form solutions with machine learning techniques. Specifically, we design a plain beamforming and power optimization combined with a deep reinforcement learning (DRL) algorithm for an AR to optimize its trajectory for the security maximization of the served users. Numerical results show that the multi-user multiple input, single output (MU-MISO) system split between a GBS and an AR with optimized transmission parameters without knowledge of the eavesdropping channels achieves high secrecy capacities that scale well with increasing the number of users.

Skip Connection YOLO Architecture for Noise Barrier Defect Detection Using UAV-Based Images in High-Speed Railway,"Noise barriers play a critical role in reducing noise and preventing foreign object from invading railway. Noise barrier structural defects such as rusted column, deteriorated mortar layer and other damages make its structure unstable, thereby threatening seriously railway operation safety. Unfortunately, existing noise barrier inspection methods still rely heavily on manual inspection, which are low-efficiency, subjective and difficult to detect the external structure of noise barriers. To solve these problems, this study proposes an automatic inspection manner for noise barrier using UAV images, and develops a fully convolutional network (FCN)-based noise barrier defect detection approach named skip connection YOLO detection network (SCYNet), which focuses on three aspects: network structure, loss function and data augmentation. First, a skip-connected feature structure Simi-BiFPN is incorporated into the network to fully fuse the features extracted from various scale layers without adding much computational overhead. Second, a NoiseIoU loss for bounding box regression is designed to improve existing IoU-based losses and get better performance on small dataset. Thirdly, a mixed sample data augmentation method named AutoFMix is proposed to eliminate the over-fitting issue caused by excessive similarity between samples, and further improve the detection accuracy. Finally, experiments conducted on the UAV railway noise barrier dataset show that the proposed SCYNet model achieves 92.2 mAP and 78.7 FPS, respectively, which outperform other models in terms of accuracy and processing speed. The fast-processing speed and high detection accuracy can quickly turn UAV images into useful information to assist railway maintenance, thereby improving the safety of train operation.  © 2000-2011 IEEE.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85165895324&doi=10.1109%2fTITS.2023.3292934&partnerID=40&md5=b8493b95011367dd32ae51c0e584af96,IEEE Transactions on Intelligent Transportation Systems,2023
SMART: Self-Morphing Adaptive Replanning Tree,"The letter presents an algorithm, called Self-Morphing Adaptive Replanning Tree (SMART), that facilitates fast replanning in dynamic environments. SMART performs risk-based tree-pruning if the current path is obstructed by nearby moving obstacle(s), resulting in multiple disjoint subtrees. Then, for speedy recovery, it exploits these subtrees and performs informed tree-repair at hot-spots that lie at the intersection of subtrees to find a new path. The performance of SMART is comparatively evaluated with eight existing algorithms through extensive simulations. Two scenarios are considered with: 1) dynamic obstacles and 2) both static and dynamic obstacles. The results show that SMART yields significant improvements in replanning time, success rate, and travel time. Finally, the performance of SMART is validated by a real laboratory experiment.  © 2016 IEEE.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85171570276&doi=10.1109%2fLRA.2023.3315210&partnerID=40&md5=8fa5827f9a98348042785b1e307bc6ed,IEEE Robotics and Automation Letters,2023
GoComfort: Comfortable Navigation for Autonomous Vehicles Leveraging High-Precision Road Damage Crowdsensing,"Recent years have witnessed rapid advances in autonomous driving technologies. Autonomous vehicles are more likely to be accepted if they drive comfortably to avoid potholes, bumps, and other road damage conditions, especially when there are elderly and disabled passengers on board. Traditionally, sensing road damage conditions is either labor-intensive by field investigation and reporting, or inaccurate by surveillance cameras and driving recorders due to limited perspective. In this paper, we propose GoComfort, a crowdsensing-based framework to provide low-cost and fine-grained comfortable navigation for autonomous vehicles with road damage identification leveraging high-precision road sensing data. First, we propose to exploit city-wide autonomous vehicle fleets as crowdsensing participants, and employ an edge-cloud-hybrid computing paradigm to efficiently collect high-precision road damage-related data, including 3D LiDAR point clouds and street view images. Second, we design an accurate road damage identification model fusing spatial structures of point clouds and texture features of street view images, and use an active learning-based method to address the sparse labels issue. Finally, we devise two comfortable navigation scenarios, i.e., fine-grained road damage avoidance and coarse-grained city-wide navigation, and propose a hierarchical road damage assessment diagram for comfortable route planning. Experiments using real-world road sensing data in Xiamen, China show that our approach identifies road damage conditions with an accuracy of 87.5%, and achieves a user acceptance rate of 93.8% in riding comfort evaluation, outperforming the state-of-the-art baselines.  © 2002-2012 IEEE.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85136855752&doi=10.1109%2fTMC.2022.3198089&partnerID=40&md5=a6bbd45312dbf9a4a05bd64c1b4af6d8,IEEE Transactions on Mobile Computing,2023
A multi-population co-evolutionary algorithm for green integrated process planning and scheduling considering logistics system,"Nowadays, green manufacturing is an increasingly significant theme in the worldwide industry fields. System integration can fully exploit the potential of subsystems to achieve satisfying green and low-carbon manufacturing. In particular, integrated process planning and scheduling (IPPS) can obtain better process routes and scheduling schemes to realize more efficient and less energy-consuming production by utilizing the complementary attributes of the process and scheduling subsystems. Additional consideration of the shop logistics system including task assignment of automated guided vehicles (AGVs) can improve shop productivity while ensuring the smooth running of the whole manufacturing system. Taking into account AGV transportation, this paper studies a green multi-objective IPPS problem considering logistics system (MO_IPPS_LS) to minimize the maximum completion time and energy consumption simultaneously. A multi-population co-evolutionary algorithm (MPCEA) is proposed with a novel integrated encoding method. The co-evolutionary framework can ensure the diversity of the populations through a backtracking mechanism and different evolutionary operators including modified critical-path based local searching. The proposed MPCEA is tested on the open benchmarks with different proportions of transport resources.

A novel hybrid Coyote–Particle Swarm Optimization Algorithm for three-dimensional constrained trajectory planning of Unmanned Aerial Vehicle,"Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) have been considered the future of transportation systems. However, mostly the reported optimizers struggle to estimate the flyable trajectories within acceptable accuracy and time bound under various constraints, particularly in a complex 3D environment. Therefore, this work proposes a novel hybrid optimizer (HCPSOA) by combining the Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) and Coyote Optimization Algorithm (COA). Further, the chaotic logistic map and dynamic weight adjustments have been incorporated to enhance the exploration–exploitation capabilities. After validating the promising performance of HCPSOA against popular metaheuristics (COA, PSO, Improved COA, Glowworm Swarm Optimization, and Hybrid Fireworks PSO) for several benchmark functions, the proposed HCPSOA has been employed to estimate the flyable path by formulating a novel cost function and smoothened by cubic B-spline curve. The simulated results reveal that the HCPSOA provide a non-colliding path with up to 10.00% lesser average cost for the considered real world scenario (map 3), which confirms its supremacy for the estimation of the safe and flyable relative to other compared algorithms. © 2023 Elsevier B.V.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85169903397&doi=10.1016%2fj.asoc.2023.110776&partnerID=40&md5=957543dc79ebd4914680cbe6bb67973b,Applied Soft Computing,2023

Secure Operations of Connected and Autonomous Vehicles,"With features of collaborative interaction and autonomous decision-making, connected and autonomous vehicles (CAVs) offer a viable solution for a sustainable and efficient future of transportation. However, with the development of CAVs, questions have been raised about weaknesses in cybersecurity and autonomous driving capabilities. In particular, CAVs provide new opportunities for cyberattackers, posing a significant threat to future road and vehicle data security. Therefore, this paper provides a comprehensive analysis of the cybersecurity environment of CAVs. First, we propose a systematic classification of six security threats from cybersecurity principles: false data, information theft, privilege escalation, block communication, and time delay. We review the cybersecurity environment of CAVs from a lifecycle perspective, covering aspects from development to accident, and present the existing cybersecurity countermeasures. These involve security standards designation, verification and validation of vehicle networks, resilient strategies for self-defined driving, and attack detection and digital forensics.

TAGKA: Threshold authenticated group key agreement protocol against member disconnect for UANET,"The development of unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) technology has been advancing rapidly and is widely applied in various domains. Compared to a single UAV, the multi-UAV system, known as the UAV Ad Hoc Network (UANET), can collaborate to accomplish complex tasks more efficiently. Due to the UAVs communicating through open wireless channels, they are vulnerable to various attacks. Group key agreement protocols are often used to guarantee the security of UANET communication. However, the high dynamics of UAVs and the instability of the wireless links often result in certain UAVs temporarily losing connection with the group, rendering them incapable of participating in the group key agreement process. Regrettably, existing literature on group key agreement does not consider this issue, which makes them not applicable to UANET. To address this issue, we propose a threshold authenticated group key agreement protocol (TAGKA) that can resist the disconnection of group members. Then, considering that the temporarily disconnected UAVs need to obtain the latest group key after the communication links are recovered, we design a group key recovery protocol. The security of the scheme is proved under the random oracle model. Moreover, formal security verification using the Tamarin and rigorous informal security analysis is also performed. Finally, we use NS-3 to simulate the protocol, and the experimental results show that our protocol can be effectively applied to UANET.  © 1967-2012 IEEE.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85162904047&doi=10.1109%2fTVT.2023.3287487&partnerID=40&md5=b3903842ebe427d3849105a43b00f97f,IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology,2023
Optimization of a Secure UAV-Based IoT: RF-Fingerprint Authentication and Resource Allocation,"Unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) technology has been developed to establish a mobile-edge computing (MEC) network for the Internet of Things (IoT). In the MEC network, users can reduce their latency by communicating and exchanging data with UAV-based edge servers.

Also, we propose a resource allocation scheme in the secure UAV-based MEC network.

Controller area network (CAN) bus without authentication and encryption mechanisms is a weakness of the in-vehicle network (IVN), and attackers always primarily target the CAN bus. Attacks on the AVs' CAN bus are more frequent because AVs have more external interfaces and sensors than ordinary vehicles. To address the abovementioned issues, this paper proposes a lightweight encryption and authentication scheme for the CAN bus of AVs using message authentication codes and Grain stream cipher. The scheme realizes efficient authentication between electronic control units and a counter re-synchronization protocol is used to ensure that authentication failure owing to counter inconsistency is prevented. Blom key management scheme is employed to rapidly distribute and update session keys, avoiding the complicated process of updating pairwise keys. In addition, considering the scalability of the IVN, a key distribution protocol for new nodes was provided. The security proof using Burrows-Abadi-Needham logic and security analysis prove that the proposed scheme can satisfy the security requirements of the IVN. In addition, performance analysis shows that the proposed scheme can meet real-time requirements and has little impact on the busload. © 1967-2012 IEEE.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85161040854&doi=10.1109%2fTVT.2023.3281276&partnerID=40&md5=88d11c96072c278961639027fd260289,IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology,2023
Smart Optimization Solution for Channel Access Attack Defense Under UAV-Aided Heterogeneous Network,"6G-based wireless communication system is poised to redefine the next-generation network landscape by enabling novel services and applications, such as intelligent link establishment, power control, data collection, transmission, and distribution. However, security issues, particularly recently revealed channel access attack (CAA), present significant challenges to performance optimization tasks in the heterogeneous wireless networks of 6G, namely, Age of Information (AoI) oriented Network (AoN), Throughput oriented Network (ToN), and Latency oriented Network (LoN). To address these challenges, this article presents a game theory-based smart optimization solution to enable unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV) to resist CAA within a 6G-based heterogeneous network. Our methodology begins by outlining the advantages and challenges associated with UAV usage, followed by the design of performance indicators and intelligent resource allocation schemes under the influence of CAA. Subsequently, we introduce definitions and categories within game theory, encompassing the concept and equilibrium of three typical game models. The efficacy of our proposed framework is validated through simulation results, which demonstrate the achievement of optimal AoI, enhanced throughput, and reduced latency compared with baseline methodologies when countering CAA in a UAV-assisted heterogeneous network.  © 2014 IEEE.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85161584577&doi=10.1109%2fJIOT.2023.3281942&partnerID=40&md5=c65cc27e07c34572a727f1357856bee4,IEEE Internet of Things Journal,2023
Distributed Adaptive Platoon Secure Control on Unmanned Vehicles System for Lane Change Under Compound Attacks,"This article concentrates on the distributed adaptive secure control on lane change maneuver of interconnected unmanned vehicular platoon (IUVP) system which is established base on vehicular ad-hoc network (VANET) technology, while the whole system exposed to compound cyber attacks, including Denial-of-Service (DoS) attack and replay attack. Firstly, with a VANET based information flow communication topology, an IUVP system including longitudinal and lateral dynamics is considered in this paper. Then a distributed secure platoon lane change control scheme is designed by using recursive method to guarantee the stability and robustness of the whole systems under compound attacks. An event triggered mechanism is designed to save communication bandwidth. The stability of the whole system is then verified via rigorous mathematical proof. Finally, the IUVP system is tested by utilizing MATLAB-Simulation of Urban Mobility (SUMO) joint simulation platform, the feasibility of the proposed strategy in relative realistic environment is confirmed, and provide the root mean square error to evaluate the safety control performance of the system. © 2000-2011 IEEE.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85171749583&doi=10.1109%2fTITS.2023.3291559&partnerID=40&md5=ac33873c51959b3c88ff9a3da4fe8d0c,IEEE Transactions on Intelligent Transportation Systems,2023
Deep Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning for Highway On-Ramp Merging in Mixed Traffic,"On-ramp merging is a challenging task for autonomous vehicles (AVs), especially in mixed traffic where AVs coexist with human-driven vehicles (HDVs). In this paper, we formulate the mixed-traffic highway on-ramp merging problem as a multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) problem, where the AVs (on both merge lane and through lane) collaboratively learn a policy to adapt to HDVs to maximize the traffic throughput. We develop an efficient and scalable MARL framework that can be used in dynamic traffic where the communication topology could be time-varying. Parameter sharing and local rewards are exploited to foster inter-agent cooperation while achieving great scalability. An action masking scheme is employed to improve learning efficiency by filtering out invalid/unsafe actions at each step. In addition, a novel priority-based safety supervisor is developed to significantly reduce collision rate and greatly expedite the training process. A gym-like simulation environment is developed and open-sourced with three different levels of traffic densities. We exploit curriculum learning to efficiently learn harder tasks from trained models under simpler settings. Comprehensive experimental results show the proposed MARL framework consistently outperforms several state-of-the-art benchmarks.  © 2000-2011 IEEE.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85163526642&doi=10.1109%2fTITS.2023.3285442&partnerID=40&md5=60dc095da47ae36bc59fa0e71b140972,IEEE Transactions on Intelligent Transportation Systems,2023
Resilient Countermeasures Against Cyber-Attacks on Self-Driving Car Architecture,"Self-driving cars, believed to be on track to become a seven trillion-dollar industry by 2050, are likely to be a popular mode of transportation in the near future, as the technology promises safety and efficiency. Significant advances have been made to achieve these objectives. However, the idea of a self-driving car completing its goals without human intervention in the presence of uncertainties is still posed with challenges. These challenges mostly relate to decision-making under uncertainties that could arise from transient faults or deliberate attempts to disrupt the system in favor of adversarial motives. Traditional schemes of hardening the system against known compromises will not suffice primarily because of the sophistication adversarial attempts have come to achieve and the rate at which new attacks are being devised. The problem demands a solution that is resilient to attacks and that would allow a self-driving vehicle to complete its designated task in the presence of attacks or faults. Several attempts have been made towards achieving resilience in autonomous vehicles. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work to give a thorough review on the resilient approaches adopted in the context and presents a taxonomy of such approaches. The paper also includes a brief introduction to the architecture of self-driving vehicles and its vulnerabilities in the presented context. This paper also discusses a novel approach using N-version programming for resilience.  © 2000-2011 IEEE.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85163440664&doi=10.1109%2fTITS.2023.3288192&partnerID=40&md5=4c6bc5da700169677f8d28326aa686c1,IEEE Transactions on Intelligent Transportation Systems,2023
A Model-Based Method for Enabling Source Mapping and Intrusion Detection on Proprietary Can Bus,"With the deep integration of the Internet of Things (IoT) technology and the increase of computational power and memory, vehicles can also serve as the infrastructures for Intelligent Transportation System (ITS), e.g., as fog nodes. However, when connecting vehicles to the internet, alongside with the benefits it brings, it also opens many new challenges such as security attacks. Controller Area Network (CAN) is one of the main in-vehicle communication protocols in modern cars. Its lack of sender verification mechanism makes CAN particularly vulnerable to cyber-attacks including masquerade attack. Fingerprinting Electronic Control Units (ECUs) based on hardware characteristics has been proved feasible and effective on defending CAN buses. However, most state-of-the-art works exploited the supervised learning algorithm to identify the transmitter based on the signal characteristics. This makes the decision process hard to understand, and it also limits the deployment on proprietary CAN bus without prior knowledge. To solve this, we design a novel clock-skew-based approach capable of pinpointing the sender and detecting intrusion on proprietary CAN bus. We take a single CAN frame as the object for measurement, and adjust the measuring process such that our approach can be independent of the transmission time of frames. Based on the statistical analysis of data from real vehicles, we propose a novel box-plot algorithm based on score mechanism to filter the raw data. Finally, the clock skews are estimated and accumulated to build a linear model for representing the transmitter ECU. The evaluation results on one CAN prototype and two production vehicles show that our approach is able to well identify and differentiate ECUs on the bus without prior knowledge. The data processed by the proposed box-plot algorithm can describe the hardware characteristics of ECUs precisely. We also show the ability of our approach to protecting the CAN bus against the masquerade attack. © 2000-2011 IEEE.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85125699308&doi=10.1109%2fTITS.2022.3153718&partnerID=40&md5=a662eed93bea96d094849e8e8632dce9,IEEE Transactions on Intelligent Transportation Systems,2023
E-Navigation: A Distributed Decision Support System With Extended Reality for Bridge and Ashore Seafarers,"A distributed decision support system has been developed to assist seafarers during several navigation tasks, for instance, in avoiding a collision with a detected obstacle in the sea and envisioning a future autonomous navigation system. In this paper, the decision support system is based on the results of a customized simulation model representing the ship's behavior, including hydrodynamics, propulsion, and control effects. Sensors monitor and collect the parameters of the environment and the ship onboard. The telemetry and the calculated route are visualized on a wearable visor exploiting augmented reality. Such context information is also replicated ashore through a narrow-band satellite link using an IoT publish-subscribe communication paradigm to allow one or more remote seafarers to supervise the situation in a virtual reality environment. Overall, the potential of the proposed system is presented and discussed for application in the context of autonomous navigation. © 2000-2011 IEEE.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85174824987&doi=10.1109%2fTITS.2023.3311817&partnerID=40&md5=8a9fa3444e9b03c00cc7eddd39a4a260,IEEE Transactions on Intelligent Transportation Systems,2023
Dynamic Watermarking for Cybersecurity of Autonomous Vehicles,"Autonomous vehicles (AVs) are rapidly proliferating. However, their future adoption is dependent on guarantees of their safety and security. Studies have shown that AVs are vulnerable to malicious cyberattacks with potentially lethal consequences. It is, therefore, imperative to deploy defensive techniques to enhance their cybersecurity. The method of dynamic watermarking (DW) has been proposed as an active technique for cyber-physical systems to detect cyberattacks. In this study, DW is implemented on an actual AV. It is shown that the DW technique is effective for timely detection of different types of attacks on the yaw rate measurement under autonomous operation, and thereby, allows recourse to measures such as stopping or pulling off to the side to prevent collisions.  © 1982-2012 IEEE.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85146223927&doi=10.1109%2fTIE.2022.3229333&partnerID=40&md5=4ea92be2c765c72ecc6f6003c09b7273,IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics,2023
Design and flight test of the fixed-flapping hybrid morphing wing aerial vehicle,"Bionic aircrafts have become a hot topic in the research on unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs). By mimicking the flight mechanics and wing morphology of living organisms, bionic aircraft not only improve aerodynamic performance, stealth, and convenience but also enable single aircraft to complete multiple specific tasks. To further improve the practical performance of bionic aircraft, a fixed-flapping hybrid morphing wing aerial vehicle (F-FWAV) is designed, and the aerodynamic and flight mechanics are studied. First, kinematic simulations are conducted on the designed F-FWAV, and the kinematic characteristics of the flapping wing are analyzed. Then, flight tests are conducted on the aircraft model, and time-domain and frequency-domain analyses were performed on the data of the pitch angle and roll angle during level flight, high angle of attack (AOA) maneuvering and landing, indicating that the pitch and roll angles of the F-FWAV are coupled. CFD numerical simulations are used to obtain the cruise points of the F-FWAV under different AOAs, frequencies, and freestream velocities. The results of the mutual interference between the fixed wing and flapping wing sections show that the flapping wing section provides more than 50 % of the lift of the entire flight process, and the downward flapping movement of the flapping wing section increases the edge vortex of the fixed wing section, thereby increasing the lift of the fixed wing section. © 2023",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85176413491&doi=10.1016%2fj.ast.2023.108705&partnerID=40&md5=c116540847c3caa3f8c8f982275b6f6b,Aerospace Science and Technology,2023
Development of quantum-enhanced authenticated key agreement protocol for autonomous vehicles,"Autonomous vehicle (AV) technology for self-driving has emerged as a promising solution to alleviate traffic congestion, reduce accidents, and optimize road capacity and fuel consumption. However, these sensors are vulnerable, making AVs susceptible to cyber threats. Consequently, security becomes an indispensable and integral facet of AV architecture. One such challenge is establishing a secure session key between the sensor device and other entities to ensure secure and authorized communication. While some existing schemes support pre-quantum era secure session key establishment within AV systems, post-quantum security's a discernible gap. This paper introduces an innovative quantum secure and highly efficient authentication and key agreement (AKA) scheme. We propose a cloud-centric three-factor authentication and key agreement system based on Ring Learning With Errors (RLWE) to provide robust authentication for both cloud and AVs. Furthermore, we have devised two distinct session keys within our authentication mechanism: one for secure remote control between users and AVs, and the other for ensuring enhanced privacy when accessing cloud-stored data via the cloud server. The efficacy of our proposed design is substantiated through a comprehensive comparative study that includes performance evaluation. Our proposed scheme has better efficiency than existing schemes and is suitable for the post-quantum era. © 2023 Elsevier Inc.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85178880116&doi=10.1016%2fj.vehcom.2023.100688&partnerID=40&md5=39062f2af5eb54c6b6fc185cb53f1f22,Vehicular Communications,2023
A ship trajectory prediction method based on GAT and LSTM,"Ship trajectory prediction plays an important role in ship route planning and collision avoidance in the development of autonomous ships. Previous models related to ship trajectory prediction have mainly focused on exploiting spatial and temporal correlation, but the accuracy and reliability of their predictions may be limited. To address this issue, this study introduces a graph attention network (GAT) and long short-term memory (LSTM) to predict ship trajectories. First, a graph network of ship trajectories is constructed based on the dependency relationship between ship trajectory data. GAT-LSTM uses GAT to extract the spatial features of ship trajectory data, while LSTM is introduced to learn the temporal features of ship trajectory data; finally, the prediction results are obtained. In this study, three real ship trajectory datasets from the AIS are used to verify the effectiveness of the proposed model and compare it with other prediction models. The experiments show that GAT-LSTM always obtains better values of the evaluation metrics than other prediction models. The model proposed in this study has high robustness in ship trajectory prediction, and the accurate prediction of ship trajectories has positive significance for maritime traffic control and safe navigation of ships. © 2023 Elsevier Ltd",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85176449951&doi=10.1016%2fj.oceaneng.2023.116159&partnerID=40&md5=4b1971048b29b35f2090d747415199fa,Ocean Engineering,2023
Research on the hydrodynamic performance of AUVs in small size open channel area,"When Autonomous Underwater Vehicles (AUVs) of different sizes sail in narrow water areas, their hydrodynamic performance is affected to varying degrees by boundaries. In this study, circulating water tank experiments and CFD simulations were conducted on three different-size ellipsoidal AUVs. The objective was to observe the influence of size on the hydrodynamics of AUVs moving at different speeds and different angles of attack in an open channel. Subsequently, a separate analysis was performed on the big size model under different sailing speeds to observe how the hydrodynamics are influenced by the boundaries of the open channel as the Froude number varies. Finally, a separate analysis was conducted to investigate the hydrodynamic effects of the open channel's free surface, bottom wall, and sidewalls on the model. It was found that the free surface has a bigger impact on an AUV's hydrodynamic performance than a solid wall. The findings show that the free surface has no effect on an AUV with a depth larger than 3.1D (AUV height D), and that hydrodynamic coefficients tend to be constant for W/B = 2.7 (channel width W, model width B) and higher. © 2023 Elsevier Ltd",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85175011529&doi=10.1016%2fj.oceaneng.2023.116190&partnerID=40&md5=dacd7ba96d8519b856d9efaea318de91,Ocean Engineering,2023
Replay attack detection and mitigation for cyber–physical systems via RADIR algorithm with encryption scheduling,"This paper investigates the security state estimation issue facing replay attacks in confidential cyber–physical systems. Smart sensor equipped with a power harvester transmits critical measurements to the remote estimator over wireless networks, in which the transmission modes include encrypted and normal. In order to complete the persistent threats, the adversary launches multi-stage discontinuous replay attacks to compromise the estimation process. In virtue of the designed label detection scheme, we transform attack detection into encryption scheduling optimization under the constraint of sensor energy harvesting and acquire a rigorous relationship between detection probability, attack duration, and encryption ratio. Different from most existing studies only focusing on attack detection, the localization of replay interval measured by detection immediacy is also analyzed. Subsequently, the optimal periodic encryption scheduling strategy is given to maximally determine the attack interval by adopting an optimization-based approach. Further, a complete algorithm of replay attack detection, isolation, and recovery (RADIR) is designed to minimize deterioration from multi-stage attacks, which can guarantee the estimated performance of the system as much as possible. Finally, the unmanned ground vehicle system is applied to validate the theoretical results, where the dataset of replay attacks is obtained by capturing the normal operation data of a moving vehicle. Also, we compare the optimal encryption strategy designed in this paper with general centralized and random scheduling strategies. © 2023",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85169901730&doi=10.1016%2fj.neucom.2023.126698&partnerID=40&md5=9045de542d12053d8745071b40e09c21,Neurocomputing,2023
Dynamic Object Classification of Low-Resolution Point Clouds: An LSTM-Based Ensemble Learning Approach,"In unmanned vehicle perception, dynamic object classification is applied to classify objects accurately and timely, providing decision-making for obstacle avoidance and planning. Low-resolution LiDAR is one of the most important sensors for this task. Unfortunately, the existing approaches perform unsatisfactorily due to the huge domain gap between low-resolution and high-resolution point cloud classification. Some schemes try to reduce the gap by fusing multi-scan information through SLAM or completing single-scan point clouds. However, these methods rely on high positioning accuracy or the wholeness of object data. To this end, differently, we propose a dynamic object classification method of low-resolution data from the perspective of time-series fusion. By modeling time series of sparse data, we indicate change rules of separate classification models for object representation. Subsequently, based on ensemble learning, our method performs feature-level fusion on multiple networks to exploit their different expression capabilities. Finally, we utilize long short-term memory to gradually classify dynamic objects. Besides, we also propose a dataset of the low-resolution point clouds and manually annotate the ground truth, which contains abundant samples of cars, pedestrians, and motorcycles. Through testing actual low-resolution data, the accuracy of our method is verified to improve a lot than the state-of-the-art approaches. © 2016 IEEE.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85174801436&doi=10.1109%2fLRA.2023.3324811&partnerID=40&md5=5eeb8b5ac3198280a79c51cb2a2c78d4,IEEE Robotics and Automation Letters,2023
Risk Assessment for Connected Vehicles Under Stealthy Attacks on Vehicle-to-Vehicle Networks,"Cooperative Adaptive Cruise Control (CACC) is an autonomous vehicle-following technology that allows groups of vehicles on the highway to form in tightly-coupled platoons. This is accomplished by exchanging inter-vehicle data through Vehicle-to-Vehicle (V2V) wireless communication networks. CACC increases traffic throughput and safety, and decreases energy consumption. However, the surge of vehicle connectivity has brought new security challenges as vehicular networks increasingly serve as new access points for adversaries trying to deteriorate the platooning performance or even cause collisions. In this manuscript, we propose a novel anomaly detection scheme that leverage real-time sensor/network data and physics-based mathematical models of vehicles in the platoon. Nevertheless, even the best detection scheme could lead to conservative detection results because of unavoidable modelling uncertainties, network effects (delays, quantization, communication dropouts), and noise. It is hard (often impossible) for any detector to distinguish between these different perturbation sources and actual attack signals. This enables adversaries to launch a range of attack strategies that can surpass the detection scheme by hiding within the system uncertainty. Here, we provide risk assessment tools (in terms of semi-definite programs) for Connected and Automated Vehicles (CAVs) to quantify the potential effect of attacks that remain hidden from the detector (referred here as stealthy attacks). A numerical case-study is presented to illustrate the effectiveness of our methods.  © 2000-2011 IEEE.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85165289904&doi=10.1109%2fTITS.2023.3292188&partnerID=40&md5=680a80b0fbfe20d0fe00af99ce8ef38e,IEEE Transactions on Intelligent Transportation Systems,2023
A Multicriteria-Based Forwarding Strategy for Interest Flooding Mitigation on Named Data Wireless Networking,"In wireless networks, the Named Data Networking (NDN) architecture maximizes contents' availability throughout multiple network paths based on multicast-based communication combined with stateful forwarding and caching in intermediate nodes. Despite its benefits, the downside of the architecture resides in the packet flooding not efficiently prevented by current forwarding strategies and mainly associated with the native flooding of the architecture or malicious packets from Interest Flooding Attack (IFA). This work introduces iFLAT, a multicriteria-based forwarding strategy for interest FLooding mitigATion on named data wireless networking. It follows a cross-layer approach that considers: (i) the Received Signal Strength (RSS) to adjust itself to the current status of the wireless network links, (ii) the network traffic (meInfo) to detect flooding issues and traffic anomalies, and (iii) a fake Interest Blacklist to identify IFA-related flooding. In doing so, the strategy achieves better efficiency on Interest flooding mitigation, addressing both native and IFA types of flooding. We evaluated the proposed strategy by reproducing a Flying Ad hoc Network (FANET) composed of Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) featured by the NDN stack deployed in all nodes. Simulation results show that iFLAT can effectively detect and mitigate flooding, regardless of its origin or nature, achieving greater packet forwarding efficiency than competing strategies. In broadcast storm and IFA scenarios, it achieved 25.75% and 37.37% of traffic reduction, whereas Interest satisfaction rates of 16.36% and 51.78% higher, respectively. © 2002-2012 IEEE.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85139436622&doi=10.1109%2fTMC.2022.3206167&partnerID=40&md5=2a98d66575c6d1910cc565a130d4d6dc,IEEE Transactions on Mobile Computing,2023
Security assessment of in-vehicle communication protocols,"As the automotive industry has progressed in recent years, in-vehicle networks have also changed. In contrast to traditional vehicles, modern vehicles communicate through connecting interfaces, Electronic Control Units (ECUs), sensors, and gateways over different communication channels called buses. While LIN, CAN, FlexRay, MOST, and Automotive Ethernet protocols facilitate vehicle communication, they expose vehicles to various security risks. Electronics in vehicles must be advanced to improve passenger safety, comfort, and vehicle performance. However, security issues must also be addressed to ensure vehicle resilience. This paper presents an in-depth and comprehensive analysis of the security issues associated with in-vehicle network protocols. We examine the feasibility, severity, and potential consequences of these security issues, which can be used to better understand the risks and vulnerabilities within in-vehicle networks. Furthermore, the paper examines existing solutions that aim to mitigate the identified attacks, including intrusion detection systems (IDSs), firewalls, authentication, and schedulers, while evaluating their effectiveness and drawbacks. Hence, we enable automotive security engineers to comprehend the current state of security measures used to protect in-vehicle networks and identify areas where further research is needed to develop more effective and tailored security solutions.

PIT: Progressive Interaction Transformer for Pedestrian Crossing Intention Prediction,"For autonomous driving, one of the major challenges is to predict pedestrian crossing intention in ego-view. Pedestrian intention depends not only on their intrinsic goals but also on the stimulation of surrounding traffic elements. Considering the influence of other traffic elements on pedestrian intention, recent work introduced more traffic element information into the model to successfully improve performance. However, it is still difficult to effectively capture and fully exploit the potential dynamic spatio-temporal interactions among the target pedestrian and its surrounding traffic elements for accurate reasoning. In this work, inspired by neuroscience that human drivers tend to make continuous sensory-motor driving decisions by progressive visual stimulation, we propose a model termed Progressive Interaction Transformer (PIT) for pedestrian crossing intention prediction. Local pedestrian, global environment, and ego-vehicle motion are considered simultaneously in the proposed PIT. In particular, the temporal fusion block and self-attention mechanism are introduced to jointly and progressively model the dynamic spatio-temporal interactions among the three parties, allowing it to capture richer information and make prediction in a similar way to human drivers. Experimental results demonstrate that PIT achieves higher performance compared with other state-of-the-arts and preserves real-time inference. © 2000-2011 IEEE.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85171738492&doi=10.1109%2fTITS.2023.3309309&partnerID=40&md5=09e675fd943691c4a89ff64a2d26a4bf,IEEE Transactions on Intelligent Transportation Systems,2023
IIDS: Intelligent Intrusion Detection System for Sustainable Development in Autonomous Vehicles,"Connected and Autonomous Vehicles (CAVs) enable various capabilities and functionalities like automated driving assistance, navigation and path planning, cruise control, independent decision making, and low-carbon transportation in the real-time environment. However, the increased CAVs usage renders the potential vulnerabilities in the Internet of Vehicles (IoV) environment, making it susceptible to cyberattacks. An Intrusion Detection System (IDS) is a technique to report network assaults by potential Autonomous Vehicles (AVs) without encryption and authorization procedures for internal and external vehicular communications. This paper proposes an Intelligent IDS (IIDS) to enhance intrusion detection and categorize malicious AVs using a modified Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) with hyperparameter optimization approaches for IoV systems. The proposed IIDS framework works in a 5G Vehicle-to-Everything (V2X) environment to effectively broadcast messages about malicious AVs. Thus IIDS aids in preventing collisions and chaos, enhancing safety monitoring in the traffic.

UAV-Assisted RSUs for V2X Connectivity Using Voronoi Diagrams in 6G+Infrastructures,"Sixth-generation networks and vehicular Ad hoc networks advancement brought us to the cusp of a new era. Autonomous Vehicles with a plethora of advanced applications require a substantially enhanced vehicle-to-everything communication network. The infrastructure should efficiently support hyper-fast, ultra-reliable, and low-latency massive data exchange. Roadside units were initially exploited as a promising communication solution to overcome this challenge. However, the challenging integration with the infrastructure led to the investigation of additional solutions. Unmanned aerial vehicles are one of the most dominant assistive solutions due to their inherent advantage of mobility. Moreover, air-to-air and ground-to-air networks are more efficient than ground-to-ground. Nevertheless, it is a prerequisite to leverage the potential of unmanned aerial vehicles to attain nationwide Vehicle-to-Everything connectivity.

Robust Perception Under Adverse Conditions for Autonomous Driving Based on Data Augmentation,"Many existing advanced deep learning-based autonomous systems have recently been used for autonomous vehicles. In general, a deep learning-based visual perception system heavily relies on visual perception to recognize and localize dynamic interest objects (e.g., pedestrians and cars) and indicative traffic signs and lights to assist autonomous vehicles in maneuvering safely.

The raindrops, light reflection, and low illumination pose a great challenge to robust object recognition. Thus, A robust and accurate autonomous driving system has attracted growing attention from the computer vision community. To achieve robust and accurate visual perception, we target to build effective and efficient augmentation and fusion techniques based on visual perception under various adverse conditions. The unpaired image-to-image (I2I) synthesis is integrated for visual perception enhancement and effective synthesis-based augmentation. Besides, we design a two-branch architecture to utilize the information from both the original image and the enhanced image synthesized by I2I. We comprehensively and hierarchically investigate the performance improvement and limitation of the proposed system based on visual recognition tasks and network backbones. An extensive experimental analysis of various adverse weather conditions is also included. The experimental results have demonstrated the proposed system could promote the ability of autonomous vehicles for robust and accurate perception under adverse weather conditions. © 2000-2011 IEEE.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85174833095&doi=10.1109%2fTITS.2023.3297318&partnerID=40&md5=c49893311b8d9d4d432c36cda76dca90,IEEE Transactions on Intelligent Transportation Systems,2023
The importance of V2X simulation: An in-depth comparison of intersection control algorithms using a high-fidelity communication simulation,"The rapid evolution of vehicle-to-vehicle and vehicle-to-infrastructure communication opens doors to various control algorithms, one particular domain being intersection control. Several researchers have proposed communication-based intersection control algorithms omitting traditional traffic lights with the promise of enhanced throughput and improved traffic safety. On the other hand, the majority of these algorithms ignore the uncertainties and delays of communication and overlook new cyberattack vectors that are opened by connected traffic. The present study employs a highly detailed simulation of vehicular communication to highlight the sensitivity of different autonomous intersection control algorithms (both centralized and decentralized) to communication-related imperfections. The paper investigates five different algorithms borrowed from the literature in a comparative way. This research focuses on traffic-related parameters such as average speed, occupancy, and network throughput while also analyzing communication-related parameters (e.g., packet loss, computational demand) and considering possible attack vectors. Simulation results suggest that even the simplest control logic is sensitive to communication failures, degrading intersection throughput below traditional intersection control or even compromising traffic safety. For centralized algorithms, in the presence of noise, average speeds drop significantly, suggesting reduced intersection throughput and even gridlock for the First Come First Serve algorithm. Decentralized algorithms can be heavily affected by incoming message orders, which can lead to dangerous situations. During the simulations, multiple collisions were registered for the Monte-Carlo Tree Search algorithm. More complex algorithms that rely on accurate prediction on vehicle trajectories are more sensitive to noise and even produce accidents in the simulation. In conclusion, regardless of control architecture, the evaluated algorithms require additional fallback solutions and redundancies to retain traffic safety. © 2023 The Author(s)",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85171987483&doi=10.1016%2fj.vehcom.2023.100676&partnerID=40&md5=63224e30a3baba782fbe1e7188ae4bc7,Vehicular Communications,2023
Adaptive Neuroevolution with Genetic Operator Control and Two-Way Complexity Variation,"Topology and weight evolving artificial neural network algorithms optimize the structure and weights of artificial neural networks (ANNs) simultaneously. The resulting networks are typically used as policy models for solving control and reinforcement learning (RL) type problems. This article presents a neuroevolution algorithm that aims to address the typical stagnation and sluggish convergence issues present in other neuroevolution algorithms. These issues are often caused by inadequacies in population diversity preservation, exploration/exploitation balance, and search flexibility. This new algorithm, called the adaptive genomic evolution of neural-network topologies (AGENT), builds on the neuroevolution of augmenting topologies (NEAT) concept. Novel mechanisms for adapting the selection and mutation operations are proposed to favorably control population diversity and exploration/exploitation balance. The former is founded on a fundamentally new way of quantifying diversity by taking a graph-theoretic perspective of the population of genomes and intergenomic differences. Further advancements to the NEAT paradigm occur through the incorporation of variable neuronal properties and new mutation operations that uniquely allow both the growth and pruning of ANN topologies during evolution. Numerical experiments with benchmark control problems adopted from the OpenAI Gym illustrate the competitive performance of AGENT against standard RL methods and adaptive HyperNEAT, and superiority over the original NEAT algorithm. Further parametric analysis provides key insights into the impact of the new features in AGENT. This is followed by evaluation on an unmanned aerial vehicle collision avoidance problem where maneuver planning models are learnt by AGENT with 33% reward improvement over 15 generations.  © 2020 IEEE.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85140766561&doi=10.1109%2fTAI.2022.3214181&partnerID=40&md5=049d8feac0dfb9bb2e586df2bb252070,IEEE Transactions on Artificial Intelligence,2023
Joint Optimization of Resource Allocation and Flight Trajectory for UAV-IoT Underwater Detecting Systems,"In a marine underwater object detecting system, sonobuoys collect underwater acoustic data and then wirelessly transmit it to an agile and controllable unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV), which, in turn, relays the raw data to the terrestrial computing center for further processing. However, constrained by the limitations in communication bandwidth and vehicle maneuverability, the UAV cannot fly over each sonobuoy to gather all the raw data within the prescribed period. In addition, to effectively detect the underwater object, we should also exploit diverse acoustical measurements of different sonobuoys (e.g., triangulation scheme) and maintain a certain level of throughput fairness among sonobuoys. Consequently, for efficient detection, both the bandwidth allocation and flight trajectory must be jointly optimized according to the importance of each sonobuoy. To this end, based on the α-fairness utility function, we design a bandwidth allocation strategy that assigns radio resource to a sonobuoy according to its weight. Similarly, in each searching round, the flying trajectory is also repeatedly optimized thus reducing the communication distances of those important sonobuoys. Moreover, in the proposed strategies, the weight of each sonobuoy and the α value are iteratively updated, which can progressively allow the UAV to fly more closely to those important sonobuoys to collect more effective data, thus significantly expediting the detecting process. Extensive simulation results have demonstrated the effectiveness of our proposed strategy, in that, compared with the benchmark strategies, it can detect underwater objects faster and more accurately . © 1967-2012 IEEE.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85164417347&doi=10.1109%2fTVT.2023.3292122&partnerID=40&md5=8cac9c8527c9bd4a8ec6c2fc99bc6ffb,IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology,2023
Infrastructure-Enabled GPS Spoofing Detection and Correction,"Accurate and robust localization is crucial for supporting high-level driving automation and safety. Modern localization solutions rely on various sensors, among which GPS has been and will continue to be essential. However, GPS can be vulnerable to malicious attacks and GPS spoofing has been identified as a high threat. With transportation infrastructure becoming increasingly important in supporting emerging vehicle technologies and systems, this study explores the potential of applying infrastructure data for defending against GPS spoofing. We propose an infrastructure-enabled framework using roadside units as an independent, secured data source. A real-time detector, based on the Isolation Forest, is constructed to detect GPS spoofing. Once spoofing is detected, GPS measurements are isolated, and the potentially compromised location estimator is corrected using secure infrastructure data. We test the proposed method using both simulation and real-world data and show its effectiveness in defending against various GPS spoofing attacks, including stealthy attacks that are proposed to fail the production-grade autonomous driving systems.  © 2000-2011 IEEE.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85166746307&doi=10.1109%2fTITS.2023.3298785&partnerID=40&md5=76e2217b44ee8c1da2ea5338d3bfd218,IEEE Transactions on Intelligent Transportation Systems,2023
RTA-IR: A runtime assurance framework for behavior planning based on imitation learning and responsibility-sensitive safety model,"Current research on artificial intelligence (AI) algorithms in safety–critical areas remains extremely challenging due to their inability to be fully verified at design time. In this paper, we propose an RTA-IR architecture, which bypasses the formal verification of the AI algorithm by incorporating runtime assurance (RTA) and provides safety assurances for the AI controllers of complex autonomous vehicles (such as those obtained using neural networks) without excessive performance sacrifice. RTA-IR consists of a high-performance and unproven advanced controller and two verifiable safety controllers and a decision module designed based on the Responsibility Sensitive Safety Model (RSS). The advanced controller is designed based on attention generating adversarial imitation learning(GAIL), which can imitate the efficient policies of experts from a set of expert demonstrations. RSS provides verifiable safety criteria and switching logic for the decision module, and RTA-IR provides safety for autonomous vehicles when the advanced controller produces unsafe control, as well as restoring control of the vehicle by the advanced controller under conditions that confirm safety. We tested and evaluated RTA-IR separately for two levels of traffic density in one driving task. Experiments have shown that RTA-IR exhibits superior performance in terms of both safety and efficiency compared to the baseline method. © 2023 Elsevier Ltd",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85162857773&doi=10.1016%2fj.eswa.2023.120824&partnerID=40&md5=b10d65bd5cb6156ec83a0339b5b9aeb2,Expert Systems with Applications,2023
Point2Lane: Polyline-Based Reconstruction With Principal Points for Lane Detection,"In this work, we observed that a nonlinear line could be expressed with a set of linear lines. We propose a novel lane detection method with polyline-based reconstruction based on this hypothesis. We define the optimal principal points with a new metric, the principal score, to generate the polyline. According to the principal score, we select principal points having a high influence on lane reconstruction and simply reproduce the target lane by connecting them. Additionally, conventional methods predict a fixed number of parameters to express each lane. However, this can limit an ability to represent a lane curvature and cause inaccurate detection results. Therefore, we set the number of principal points to be dynamically changed depending on the lane curvature to solve this problem. This allows the model to make flexible detection results reflecting the characteristics of each lane. We also propose a training strategy with a new piece-wise linear equation-based loss function. With this strategy, the model is fine-tuned to predict the principal points representing the curved parts of the lane well. Last, we propose a spatial context-aware feature flip fusion module to exploit the symmetric property of road images. This module helps the model selectively utilize the spatial context in the flipped feature map based on the lane density. We effectively reduce the adverse effects, especially the false positives of the existing feature flip fusion module misaligned on asymmetrical images. The experiments show that the proposed method provides competitive lane detection results compared to state-of-the-art methods.  © 2000-2011 IEEE.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85166330614&doi=10.1109%2fTITS.2023.3295807&partnerID=40&md5=7a6727da7654f95d47cd2e97f81a2c4f,IEEE Transactions on Intelligent Transportation Systems,2023
Deep Learning-Based Anomaly Detection for Connected Autonomous Vehicles Using Spatiotemporal Information,"Although connected mymargin autonomous vehicles (CAVs) hold great potential to improve driving safety and experience significantly, cybersecurity remains a critical concern. As the de-facto standard for in-vehicle networks, the Controller Area Network (CAN) carries messages and commands vital to the operation of the vehicle. However, due to a lack of security mechanisms, intruders are able to conduct devastating attacks on drivers and passengers over CAN. In order to safeguard CAVs, an Intrusion Detection System (IDS) can be deployed to monitor CAN network activities and detect suspicious behavior resulting from an attack. This paper proposes a prediction-based IDS framework for detecting anomalies and attacks on a CAN bus using temporal correlation of message contents. Two candidates are introduced as the prediction module. The first network is an LSTM that predicts time series data separately for each CAN ID, and the second is a ConvLSTM that predicts messages using correlated data of several CAN IDs. An attack is classified according to prediction errors by a Gaussian Naïve Bayes classifier. The proposed IDS is evaluated against other state-of-the-art one-class classifiers, including OCSVM, Isolation Forest, and Autoencoder, and three existing works, including ReducedInception-ResNet, NeuroCAN, and CANLite, using a real-world dataset, the Car Hacking Dataset. A comparison between the two suggested architectures and their use cases is given. Compared to baseline methods and related studies, the proposed method is shown to be more accurate and can achieve F-scores and detection accuracy of almost 100%.  © 2000-2011 IEEE.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85163723848&doi=10.1109%2fTITS.2023.3286611&partnerID=40&md5=9478ab01b92069ae94fd33b8ddcd0a00,IEEE Transactions on Intelligent Transportation Systems,2023
IRS-Assisted Anti-Jamming Transmission for an Integrated Satellite-UAV-Terrestrial Network With Imperfect CSI: A Game-Based Perspective,"In this article, an intelligent reflecting surface (IRS)-assisted integrated satellite-unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV)-terrestrial (SUT) Internet of Things (IoT) network faced with a smart jammer under imperfect channel state information (CSI) conditions is considered. We propose a Stackelberg game model to describe the adversarial relationship between the satellite, UAV, and IRS and the jammer, which are modeled as the leader and the follower, respectively. For the follower subgame, the jammer aims to minimize the jamming power while guaranteeing that the jamming energy efficiency surpasses a certain threshold. Under this setup, the Angle of Arrival (AoA)-based discretization method is utilized to address the imperfect CSI issue. Then, the use-and-then-forget method and the Lagrangian function are employed to obtain a closed-form expression for the jammer's power. Finally, a feasible jamming power solution is obtained by means of the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality. For the leader subgame, we aim to optimize the hybrid beamforming design of the satellite, UAV and IRS, with the goal of minimizing the total transmit power, while guaranteeing that the downlink received signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR) surpasses the minimum communication threshold. We propose an alternating optimization scheme, in which the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality, the AoA-based discretization method, and nonsmooth penalty functions are employed to alternately obtain the optimal satellite beamforming vector, UAV beamforming vector and IRS phase matrix when the other variables are fixed. Through our analytical and numerical results, the proposed beamforming scheme achieves a reduction of 16.9% in average power consumption compared with other benchmark schemes when obtaining the same anti-jamming performance.  © 2014 IEEE.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85162691206&doi=10.1109%2fJIOT.2023.3285216&partnerID=40&md5=cb38751ced4df37e96e9656cfac951f4,IEEE Internet of Things Journal,2023
CMX: Cross-Modal Fusion for RGB-X Semantic Segmentation With Transformers,"Scene understanding based on image segmentation is a crucial component of autonomous vehicles. Pixel-wise semantic segmentation of RGB images can be advanced by exploiting complementary features from the supplementary modality (X-modality). However, covering a wide variety of sensors with a modality-agnostic model remains an unresolved problem due to variations in sensor characteristics among different modalities. Unlike previous modality-specific methods, in this work, we propose a unified fusion framework, CMX, for RGB-X semantic segmentation. To generalize well across different modalities, that often include supplements as well as uncertainties, a unified cross-modal interaction is crucial for modality fusion. Specifically, we design a Cross-Modal Feature Rectification Module (CM-FRM) to calibrate bi-modal features by leveraging the features from one modality to rectify the features of the other modality. With rectified feature pairs, we deploy a Feature Fusion Module (FFM) to perform sufficient exchange of long-range contexts before mixing. To verify CMX, for the first time, we unify five modalities complementary to RGB, i.e., depth, thermal, polarization, event, and LiDAR. Extensive experiments show that CMX generalizes well to diverse multi-modal fusion, achieving state-of-the-art performances on five RGB-Depth benchmarks, as well as RGB-Thermal, RGB-Polarization, and RGB-LiDAR datasets. Besides, to investigate the generalizability to dense-sparse data fusion, we establish an RGB-Event semantic segmentation benchmark based on the EventScape dataset, on which CMX sets the new state-of-the-art.

Lifelong Vehicle Trajectory Prediction Framework Based on Generative Replay,"Accurate trajectory prediction of vehicles is essential for reliable autonomous driving. To maintain consistent performance as a vehicle driving around different cities, it is crucial to adapt to changing traffic circumstances and achieve lifelong trajectory prediction model. To realize it, catastrophic forgetting is a main problem to be addressed. In this paper, a divergence measurement method based on conditional Kullback-Leibler divergence is proposed first to evaluate spatiotemporal dependency difference among varied driving circumstances. Then based on generative replay, a novel lifelong vehicle trajectory prediction framework is developed. The framework consists of a conditional generation model and a vehicle trajectory prediction model. The conditional generation model is a generative adversarial network conditioned on position configuration of vehicles. After learning and merging trajectory distribution of vehicles across different cities, the generation model replays trajectories with prior samplings as inputs, which alleviates catastrophic forgetting. The vehicle trajectory prediction model is trained by the replayed trajectories and achieves consistent prediction performance on visited cities. A lifelong experiment setup is established on four open datasets including five tasks. Spatiotemporal dependency divergence is calculated for different tasks. Even though these divergence, the proposed framework exhibits lifelong learning ability and achieves consistent performance on all tasks.  © 2000-2011 IEEE.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85167809038&doi=10.1109%2fTITS.2023.3300545&partnerID=40&md5=74910e260a8d6273ff14f7f82c0250d9,IEEE Transactions on Intelligent Transportation Systems,2023
Hawk-Pigeon Game Tactics for Unmanned Aerial Vehicle Swarm Target Defense,"Unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) swarm target defense is a crucial and practical issue about group decision-making and cooperative control in multiagent systems. Hawk-pigeon game architecture is presented in this article to guide UAV swarm target defense. Firstly, a 6-degree-of-freedom UAV model is employed, and the control command converter is derived, which could be widely used in the transformation from the second-order integrator model to the 6-DOF UAV model. Moreover, the attack tactics and pursuit strategies of the defender UAVs are proposed inspired by the hawk's hunting mechanism, and the dynamic model of the attacker UAVs is formulated inspired by pigeon group homing behavior. Furthermore, the victory zone of the hawk-pigeon game is analyzed using the time of interception and explicitly exhibited in isochrones means. The proposed method is scalable and adaptive, adopting distributed decision-making to support large-scale UAV swarm engagement. Finally, comparative experiments in different scenarios demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method over state-of-the-art target-attacker-defender game methods on the win rate, the number of captures, and activity time.  © 2023 IEEE.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85149386902&doi=10.1109%2fTII.2023.3248075&partnerID=40&md5=e9b09c110ef5cb39a2184a9a140bbb52,IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics,2023
Two-Stage Intrusion Detection System in Intelligent Transportation Systems Using Rule Extraction Methods From Deep Neural Networks,"In recent years, intrusion detection systems (IDSs) are offering effective solutions to protect various types of cyber-attacks in different networks such as Internet of Vehicles (IoVs) network in Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS). Deep learning models have largely been leveraged by these intrusion detection systems to achieve better effectiveness results. However, deep learning models are black boxes, which limits their acceptability in decision systems. Also, they require powerful processing capabilities such as GPU, which limit their deployments in resource-constrained devices in IoV environment. To deal with these issues, we propose a two-stage IDS in ITS to discover suspicious network activity of In-Vehicles Networks (IVN) and vehicles to everything (V2X) networks. Our proposed IDS system uses rule extraction methods from deep learning models, i.e., deep neural networks in two stages. In the first stage, we analyze network traffic to distinguish between normal and attack traffic. If the traffic is found malicious, the second stage is invoked to identify the type of attack. To this end, we propose three variants of rule extraction. The first and the second variants are homogeneous, and they apply $DeepRed$ and $HypInv$ rule extraction methods in both stages respectively. The third variant is heterogeneous, and it applies $HypInv$ in the first stage to perform binary classification, and $DeepRed$ in the second stage to perform attack classification. The key idea is to combine the advantages of rule extraction technique and two-stage IDS architecture to resource consumption and improve classification accuracy. The proposed IDS model was tested using four benchmark datasets, i.e. ISCXIDS2012, CIC-IDS2017, and CSE-CIC-IDS2018 datasets are used for external network communications and the car hacking dataset are used for in-vehicle communications. The evaluation results show that the homogeneous $DeepRed$ is the optimal one in all cases of IDS system with an accuracy scores ranging between 92.43%-98.32% under CIC-IDS2017 dataset, between 91.32%-99.46% under CSE-CIC-IDS2018 dataset, and between 96.05%-99.21% under Car-hacking dataset.  © 2000-2011 IEEE.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85137913919&doi=10.1109%2fTITS.2022.3202869&partnerID=40&md5=934a5e953d9dee7859420f4dc2df5bfc,IEEE Transactions on Intelligent Transportation Systems,2023
Lightweight Blockchain-Based Secure Spectrum Sharing in Space-Air-Ground-Integrated IoT Network,"Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) will be widely deployed due to their flexibility, mobility, and miniaturization, providing the necessary support for spectrum sharing between different communication systems in the space-air-ground-integrated IoT network (SAGIN). However, there are potential security threats to spectrum sharing among different communication systems due to the openness of a wireless network, the unreliability of node behavior, and the trust barriers of the networks. In this article, a secure spectrum sharing scheme based on lightweight UAV-blockchain (LUBC) is proposed to address the above security issues. First, a spectrum sharing model based on the overlay mode is developed to improve the spectrum efficiency of SAGIN, where UAVs relay signals from the satellite to the ground users in exchange for spectrum access opportunities and serve their own users simultaneously in the nonorthogonal multiple access (NOMA) mode. Second, a secure spectrum sharing framework based on LUBC is proposed to solve the security and privacy issues of spectrum trading in SAGIN. Then, aiming at maximizing the primary user's throughput under the premise of meeting the minimum power allocation factor of UAV network, the spectrum auction based on NOMA is formulated as a multirelay selection optimization problem, which is solved by the blockchain-based sequential Vickrey auction mechanism. Finally, the security evaluation and numerical results are conducted to verify the security and effectiveness of the proposed spectrum sharing scheme for SAGIN.  © 2014 IEEE.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85162928761&doi=10.1109%2fJIOT.2023.3288121&partnerID=40&md5=da96d69ea0a7b39fa7866eedd3289bee,IEEE Internet of Things Journal,2023
B-UAVM: A Blockchain-Supported Secure Multi-UAV Task Management Scheme,"The advent of unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) swarm technology brings possibilities to help humans complete tasks in no man's land, such as deserts and rainforests. However, UAV network faces many cyber threats, where attackers can impersonate legitimate entities or tamper with UAV task data. For identity security, most of the existing methods use centralized authentication schemes, which have a single point of failure problem. For data security, the existing methods only secure the task data in the ground system, ignoring the data security in the air network. Therefore, the existing methods are not suitable for ubiquitous UAV scenarios. Blockchain secures data security while eliminating the single point of failure problem, and has been widely used in distributed scenarios. In this article, to secure entity identity and task data, we propose a blockchain-supported secure multi-UAV task management scheme (B-UAVM). Specifically, a three-layer blockchain structure is constructed to secure multitasks, and achieve ubiquitous control of UAV formations. Besides, six types of blocks and three types of transactions are designed to achieve safe processing and storage of task data and entity information. Furthermore, an improved practical byzantine fault tolerance (IPBFT) consensus mechanism and a UAV-formation-action-considered ground station consensus mechanism (UFAGS) are introduced in the Server Network and Ground Control Network, respectively, to accelerate the consensus. The experimental results show that the number of transactions generated per second (TPS) of B-UAVM is about 0.5× and 3.7× of the existing method when the block size or the number of blockchain nodes increases, respectively.  © 2014 IEEE.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85161085219&doi=10.1109%2fJIOT.2023.3279923&partnerID=40&md5=c88286ed8aefe8551afdf30c69cd0259,IEEE Internet of Things Journal,2023

CtRL-Sim: Reactive and Controllable Driving Agents with Offline Reinforcement Learning,"Evaluating autonomous vehicle stacks (AVs) in simulation typically involves replaying driving logs from real-world recorded traffic. However, agents replayed from offline data are not reactive and hard to intuitively control. Existing approaches address these challenges by proposing methods that rely on heuristics or generative models of real-world data but these approaches either lack realism or necessitate costly iterative sampling procedures to control the generated behaviours. In this work, we take an alternative approach and propose CtRL-Sim, a method that leverages return-conditioned offline reinforcement learning (RL) to efficiently generate reactive and controllable traffic agents. Specifically, we process real-world driving data through a physics-enhanced Nocturne simulator to generate a diverse offline RL dataset, annotated with various rewards. With this dataset, we train a return-conditioned multi-agent behaviour model that allows for fine-grained manipulation of agent behaviours by modifying the desired returns for the various reward components. This capability enables the generation of a wide range of driving behaviours beyond the scope of the initial dataset, including adversarial behaviours. We show that CtRL-Sim can generate realistic safety-critical scenarios while providing fine-grained control over agent behaviours. © 2024 Proceedings of Machine Learning Research.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-86000768560&partnerID=40&md5=115325a9b1fcb23c994a6af50538a810,Proceedings of Machine Learning Research,2024
Directly-trained Spiking Neural Networks for Deep Reinforcement Learning: Energy efficient implementation of event-based obstacle avoidance on a neuromorphic accelerator,"Spiking Neural Networks (SNN) promise extremely low-power and low-latency inference on neuromorphic hardware. Recent studies demonstrate the competitive performance of SNNs compared with Artificial Neural Networks (ANN) in conventional classification tasks. In this work, we present an energy-efficient implementation of a Reinforcement Learning (RL) algorithm using SNNs to solve an obstacle avoidance task performed by an Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV), taking a Dynamic Vision Sensor (DVS) as event-based input. We train the SNN directly, improving upon state-of-art implementations based on hybrid (not directly trained) SNNs. For this purpose, we devise an adaptation of the Spatio-Temporal Backpropagation algorithm (STBP) for RL. We then compare the SNN with a state-of-art Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) designed to solve the same task. To this aim, we train both networks by exploiting a photorealistic training pipeline based on AirSim. To achieve a realistic latency and throughput assessment for embedded deployment, we designed and trained three different embedded SNN versions to be executed on state-of-art neuromorphic hardware, targeting state-of-the-art. We compared SNN and CNN in terms of obstacle avoidance performance showing that the SNN algorithm achieves better results than the CNN with a factor of 6× less energy. We also characterize the different SNN hardware implementations in terms of energy and spiking activity. © 2023 The Authors",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85174806986&doi=10.1016%2fj.neucom.2023.126885&partnerID=40&md5=6f5f25ace19ea405a006991cc9c9ebef,Neurocomputing,2023
Hint-AD: Holistically Aligned Interpretability in End-to-End Autonomous Driving,"End-to-end architectures in autonomous driving (AD) face a significant challenge in interpretability, impeding human-AI trust. Human-friendly natural language has been explored for tasks such as driving explanation and 3D captioning. However, previous works primarily focused on the paradigm of declarative interpretability, where the natural language interpretations are not grounded in the intermediate outputs of AD systems, making the interpretations only declarative. In contrast, aligned interpretability establishes a connection between language and the intermediate outputs of AD systems. Here we introduce Hint-AD, an integrated AD-language system that generates language aligned with the holistic perception-prediction-planning outputs of the AD model. By incorporating the intermediate outputs and a holistic token mixer sub-network for effective feature adaptation, Hint-AD achieves desirable accuracy, achieving state-of-the-art results in driving language tasks including driving explanation, 3D dense captioning, and command prediction. To facilitate further study on driving explanation task on nuScenes, we also introduce a human-labeled dataset, Nu-X.

Rate-Informed Discovery via Bayesian Adaptive Multifidelity Sampling,"Ensuring the safety of autonomous vehicles (AVs) requires both accurate estimation of their performance and efficient discovery of potential failure cases. This paper introduces Bayesian adaptive multifidelity sampling (BAMS), which leverages the power of adaptive Bayesian sampling to achieve efficient discovery while simultaneously estimating the rate of adverse events. BAMS prioritizes exploration of regions with potentially low performance, leading to the identification of novel and critical scenarios that traditional methods might miss. Using real-world AV data we demonstrate that BAMS discovers 10 times as many issues as Monte Carlo (MC) and importance sampling (IS) baselines, while at the same time generating rate estimates with variances 15 and 6 times narrower than MC and IS baselines respectively. © 2024 Proceedings of Machine Learning Research.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-86000740580&partnerID=40&md5=3905a6e1669cacbc16e48c7d88d10a79,Proceedings of Machine Learning Research,2024
Autonomous Improvement of Instruction Following Skills via Foundation Models,"Intelligent instruction-following robots capable of improving from autonomously collected experience have the potential to transform robot learning: instead of collecting costly teleoperated demonstration data, large-scale deployment of fleets of robots can quickly collect larger quantities of autonomous data that can collectively improve their performance. However, autonomous improvement requires solving two key problems: (i) fully automating a scalable data collection procedure that can collect diverse and semantically meaningful robot data and (ii) learning from non-optimal, autonomous data with no human annotations. To this end, we propose a novel approach that addresses these challenges, allowing instruction-following policies to improve from autonomously collected data without human supervision. Our framework leverages vision-language models to collect and evaluate semantically meaningful experiences in new environments, and then utilizes a decomposition of instruction following tasks into (semantic) language-conditioned image generation and (non-semantic) goal reaching, which makes it significantly more practical to improve from this autonomously collected data without any human annotations. We carry out extensive experiments in the real world to demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach, and find that in a suite of unseen environments, the robot policy can be improved 2x with autonomously collected data. We open-source the code for our semantic autonomous improvement pipeline, as well as our autonomous dataset of 30.5K trajectories collected across five tabletop environments. © 2024 Proceedings of Machine Learning Research.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-86000794837&partnerID=40&md5=d6c046b29d8e28e2520503c9d82e3779,Proceedings of Machine Learning Research,2024
Lifelong Autonomous Fine-Tuning of Navigation Foundation Models in the Wild,"Recent works have proposed a number of general-purpose robotic foundation models that can control a variety of robotic platforms to perform a range of different tasks, including in the domains of navigation and manipulation. However, such models are typically trained via imitation learning, which precludes the ability to adapt autonomously through experience that the robot gathers on the job. In this work, our aim is to train general-purpose robotic foundation models in the domain of robotic navigation specifically with the aim of enabling autonomous self-improvement. We show that a combination of pretraining with offline reinforcement learning and a complete system for continual autonomous operation leads to a robotic learning framework that not only starts off with broad and diverse capabilities, but can further specialize and adapt those capabilities in the course of carrying out navigational tasks in a given deployment location. To our knowledge, this result demonstrates the first navigation robot foundation model to continually learn via autonomous interaction in open-world settings. © 2024 Proceedings of Machine Learning Research.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-86000748721&partnerID=40&md5=fb3cdb5005fc23b378e4a0be90d35f29,Proceedings of Machine Learning Research,2024
Shelf-Supervised Cross-Modal Pre-Training for 3D Object Detection,"State-of-the-art 3D object detectors are often trained on massive labeled datasets. However, annotating 3D bounding boxes remains prohibitively expensive and time-consuming, particularly for LiDAR. Instead, recent works demonstrate that self-supervised pre-training with unlabeled data can improve detection accuracy with limited labels. Contemporary methods adapt best-practices for self-supervised learning from the image domain to point clouds (such as contrastive learning). However, publicly available 3D datasets are considerably smaller and less diverse than those used for image-based self-supervised learning, limiting their effectiveness. We do note, however, that such 3D data is naturally collected in a multimodal fashion, often paired with images. Rather than pre-training with only self-supervised objectives, we argue that it is better to bootstrap point cloud representations using image-based foundation models trained on internet-scale data. Specifically, we propose a shelf-supervised approach (e.g. supervised with off-the-shelf image foundation models) for generating zero-shot 3D bounding boxes from paired RGB and LiDAR data. Pre-training 3D detectors with such pseudo-labels yields significantly better semi-supervised detection accuracy than prior self-supervised pretext tasks. Importantly, we show that image-based shelf-supervision is helpful for training LiDAR-only, RGB-only and multi-modal (RGB + LiDAR) detectors. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach on nuScenes and WOD, significantly improving over prior work in limited data settings.

OCCAM: Online Continuous Controller Adaptation with Meta-Learned Models,"Control tuning and adaptation present a significant challenge to the usage of robots in diverse environments. It is often nontrivial to find a single set of control parameters by hand that work well across the broad array of environments and conditions that a robot might encounter. Automated adaptation approaches must utilize prior knowledge about the system while adapting to significant domain shifts to find new control parameters quickly. In this work, we present a general framework for online controller adaptation that deals with these challenges. We combine meta-learning with Bayesian recursive estimation to learn prior predictive models of system performance that quickly adapt to online data, even when there is significant domain shift. These predictive models can be used as cost functions within efficient sampling-based optimization routines to find new control parameters online that maximize system performance. Our framework is powerful and flexible enough to adapt controllers for four diverse systems: a simulated race car, a simulated quadrupedal robot, and a simulated and physical quadrotor.

FREA: Feasibility-Guided Generation of Safety-Critical Scenarios with Reasonable Adversariality,"Generating safety-critical scenarios, which are essential yet difficult to collect at scale, offers an effective method to evaluate the robustness of autonomous vehicles (AVs). Existing methods focus on optimizing adversariality while preserving the naturalness of scenarios, aiming to achieve a balance through data-driven approaches. However, without an appropriate upper bound for adversariality, the scenarios might exhibit excessive adversariality, potentially leading to unavoidable collisions. In this paper, we introduce FREA, a novel safety-critical scenarios generation method that incorporates the Largest Feasible Region (LFR) of AV as guidance to ensure the REasonableness of the Adversarial scenarios. Concretely, FREA initially pre-calculates the LFR of AV from offline datasets. Subsequently, it learns a reasonable adversarial policy that controls the scene's critical background vehicles (CBVs) to generate adversarial yet AV-feasible scenarios by maximizing a novel feasibility-dependent adversarial objective function. Extensive experiments illustrate that FREA can effectively generate safety-critical scenarios, yielding considerable near-miss events while ensuring AV's feasibility. Generalization analysis also confirms the robustness of FREA in AV testing across various surrogate AV methods and traffic environments.

Agricultural UAV trajectory planning by incorporating multi-mechanism improved grey wolf optimization algorithm,"Unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) trajectory planning plays an essential role in agricultural production and biological control. To solve the agricultural UAV trajectory planning problem, a multi-mechanism collaborative improved grey wolf optimization algorithm (NAS-GWO) is proposed. In NAS-GWO, the evolutionary boundary constraint processing mechanism is introduced to update the position of the grey wolf individuals that cross the boundary in time to retain the position information of the optimal individuals to the largest degree to enhance the search accuracy of the algorithm. Then, the Gaussian mutation strategy and spiral function are used as perturbation mechanisms to help the algorithm jump out of the local optimum in time to strengthen the exploitation capability of NAS-GWO. Meanwhile, the improved Sigmoid function is used as a nonlinear convergence factor for balancing the exploitation and exploration of the NAS-GWO. By comparing NAS-GWO with ten advanced metaheuristic algorithms on 20 CEC2017 benchmark functions, the experimental results show that the NAS-GWO algorithm has superior merit seeking and robustness. Moreover, the agricultural UAV trajectory planning problem is solved using NAS-GWO. The experimental results show that the NAS-GWO algorithm plans a more viable and stable trajectory path in four different scale missions, while the most important is that it requires less cost. Among them, the algorithm reduces 27.93%, 38.15%, 32.32%, 34.11%, 10.63%, and 13.48% on average in cost function values compared to Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO), Whale Optimization Algorithm (WOA), Aquila Optimizer (AO), Differential Evolution (DE), Dung Beetle Optimizer (DBO), and Grey Wolf Optimization algorithm (GWO), thus proving the effectiveness and significance of NAS-GWO in the agricultural UAV trajectory path planning problem. © 2023 Elsevier Ltd",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85164692649&doi=10.1016%2fj.eswa.2023.120946&partnerID=40&md5=5c10d260c19b8aaf914d961ccef5c9bd,Expert Systems with Applications,2023
Completion Time Minimization for UAV-Enabled Surveillance Over Multiple Restricted Regions,"This work examines a UAV-enabled surveillance mission over multiple restricted regions and aims to determine the optimal UAV trajectory that minimizes the mission completion time. The UAV is prohibited from entering the restricted regions due to government regulations or adversarial concerns. However, during the surveillance of a region, the UAV can move along the region's boundary to reduce its distance to the next region once the local task is completed. To exploit this advantage, we propose a minimum completion time (MinTime) algorithm that first determines the visiting order of the regions by employing an approximate solution of the traveling salesman problem (TSP) and then optimizes the UAV trajectory over the sequence of restricted regions using dynamic programming. In the presence of obstacles, we further propose an obstacle-aware MinTime (OA-MinTime) algorithm that treats each obstacle as an additional restricted region with zero surveillance duration, allowing the UAV to avoid the obstacles in a more efficient manner. A modified TSP solution is also proposed by taking into consideration the additional distance required to circumvent the obstacles on each inter-POI path. Simulation results show that the proposed MinTime and OA-MinTime algorithms can significantly reduce the total completion time compared to conventional minimum-distance approaches.  © 2002-2012 IEEE.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85137556357&doi=10.1109%2fTMC.2022.3200732&partnerID=40&md5=ad6961dfb15f4699850caa3f047690ad,IEEE Transactions on Mobile Computing,2023
Robust Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning for Autonomous Vehicle in Noisy Highway Environments,"The field of research on multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) algorithms in self-driving vehicles is rapidly expanding in mixed-traffic scenarios where autonomous vehicles (AVs) and human-driven vehicles (HDVs) coexist. Most studies assume that all AVs can obtain accurate state information. However, in real-world scenarios, noisy sensor measurements have a significant impact. To address this issue, we propose an effective and robust MARL algorithm Multi-Agent Proximal Policy Optimization with Curriculum-based Adversarial Learning (CA-MAPPO) for situations where the observation perturbations are considered. The proposed approach incorporates adversarial samples during training and adopts a curriculum learning approach by gradually increasing the noise intensity. By evaluating the proposed approach in the ideal environment and scenarios under noise attacks with varying intensities, experiment results demonstrate that the proposed algorithm enables AVs to achieve a success rate of over 70% for the multi-lane highway on-ramp merging task, achieving a maximum average speed of up to over 19 m/s and performing significantly better than the state-of-the-art MARL algorithms such as MAPPO and MAACKTR. © 2024 L.

Heterogeneous UAV Task Allocation Using Shapley Value-Based Clustering,"In this paper, we propose a Shapley value-based approach for clustering unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) to handle heterogeneous missions. Our focus includes surveillance and reconnaissance (SR) missions and attack missions, with surveillance UAVs dedicated to SR missions and attack UAVs capable of handling both SR and attack missions. The parameters for UAV capabilities and mission requirements are set empirically, considering factors such as energy efficiency, speed, operating cost, priority, operation time, and risk level. By employing Shapley value calculations through a sampling-based method, we determine the marginal contribution of each UAV to various UAV-task clusters. This approach ensures that each cluster receives an equitable number of missions by minimizing Shapley value disparities between clusters. Simulation results demonstrate the effective allocation of UAVs to diverse missions while satisfying operational constraints. Overall, the proposed method effectively balances workload and resource utilization among UAVs, preventing over-concentration on specific UAVs and ensuring fair task distribution. © 2024 ICROS.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85214435726&doi=10.23919%2fICCAS63016.2024.10773174&partnerID=40&md5=6c0179b21ad8a47aee98fdeb6befbeb8,"International Conference on Control, Automation and Systems",2024
DTCLMapper: Dual Temporal Consistent Learning for Vectorized HD Map Construction,"Temporal information plays a pivotal role in Bird's-Eye-View (BEV) driving scene understanding, which can alleviate the visual information sparsity. However, the indiscriminate temporal fusion method will cause the barrier of feature redundancy when constructing vectorized High-Definition (HD) maps. In this paper, we revisit the temporal fusion of vectorized HD maps, focusing on temporal instance consistency and temporal map consistency learning. To improve the representation of instances in single-frame maps, we introduce a novel method, DTCLMapper. This approach uses a dual-stream temporal consistency learning module that combines instance embedding with geometry maps. In the instance embedding component, our approach integrates temporal Instance Consistency Learning (ICL), ensuring consistency from vector points and instance features aggregated from points. A vectorized points pre-selection module is employed to enhance the regression efficiency of vector points from each instance. Then aggregated instance features obtained from the vectorized points preselection module are grounded in contrastive learning to realize temporal consistency, where positive and negative samples are selected based on position and semantic information. The geometry mapping component introduces Map Consistency Learning (MCL) designed with self-supervised learning. The MCL enhances the generalization capability of our consistent learning approach by concentrating on the global location and distribution constraints of the instances. Extensive experiments on well-recognized benchmarks indicate that the proposed DTCLMapper achieves state-of-the-art performance in vectorized mapping tasks, reaching 61.9% and 65.1% mAP scores on the nuScenes and Argoverse datasets, respectively.

Time Series Anomaly Detection in Vehicle Sensors Using Self-Attention Mechanisms,"Connected autonomous vehicles (CAVs) offer significant enhancements in coordinated traffic and safety through real-time vehicle-to-vehicle or vehicle-to-infrastructure communications, establishing them as a potent tool for augmenting driving tasks. However, the extensive information-sharing framework inherent in CAVs amplifies the risk associated with sensor anomalies, posing challenges to the reliability and security of the system. Responding to this timely research challenge, this study proposes a novel anomaly detection method, namely Dual-channel Self-attention-based Convolutional Neural Network (DSA-CNN) for multivariate time series data. Through the introduction of the Dual-channel Self-attention Mechanism, DSA-CNN can progressively and autonomously extract spatiotemporal features from multivariate time series data. The proposed method was tested under a variety of common threatening sensor anomaly patterns of CAVs summarised in the literature, and evaluated under multiple different performance metrics. The results demonstrate its advantages in detecting minor anomalies and enhancing sensitivity, outperforming previously reported methods in the literature. Across all experimental scenarios, an average sensitivity improvement of 2.53% was observed, complemented by an average F1 score increase of 1.47%. In CAV settings, maintaining high sensitivity to ensure fewer undetected anomalies, alongside the ability to detect small anomalies, can be more important for the robustness and safety measures of CAV systems.  © 2024 IEEE.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85209365254&doi=10.1109%2fTITS.2024.3415435&partnerID=40&md5=eef5944eed6a1dda10eb83e79eed109e,IEEE Transactions on Intelligent Transportation Systems,2024
Resilient Cruise Control of Heterogeneous Platoons Against Byzantine Attacks: Theory and Experiment,"This article studies the problem of the resilient cruise control in heterogeneous vehicle platoons against f-local Byzantine attacks (BAs). Agents under BAs become traitors of the swarm, who try to mislead its neighbors while adopting wrong inputs. Thus, BAs are extremely challenging to be suppressed. This study introduces a novel hierarchical protocol characterized by a virtual twin layer (TL), motivated by the rationale of digital twin. This protocol separates the defense scheme against f-local BAs into two parts: one defense scheme against Byzantine edge attacks (BEAs) via the TL and another scheme against Byzantine node attacks (BNAs) via the cyber-physical layer (CPL). The TL employs a trusted-edge strategy, enhancing the network resilience by incorporating a minimal fraction of the key edges. It is rigorously proven that a TL topology meeting strong (2f+1) -robustness is sufficient for achieving distributed resilient estimation against BEAs. On the CPL, a series of decentralized chattering-free controllers is proposed, guaranteeing the resilient cruise tracking of heterogeneous platoons against exponentially unbounded BNAs. Besides, these controllers can achieve uniformly ultimately bounded convergence. The theoretical results' effectiveness and practicality are validated through a numerical simulation example and an unmanned ground vehicle experiment involving heterogeneous platoons against f-local BAs. © 2024 IEEE.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85210540814&doi=10.1109%2fTCYB.2024.3430324&partnerID=40&md5=d7ac371a909dcf46b5a1bb4305135820,IEEE Transactions on Cybernetics,2024
Demonstration Data-Driven Parameter Adjustment for Trajectory Planning in Highly Constrained Environments,"Trajectory planning in highly constrained environments is crucial for robotic navigation. Classical algorithms are widely used for their interpretability, generalization, and system robustness. However, these algorithms often require parameter retuning when adapting to new scenarios. To address this issue, we propose a demonstration data-driven reinforcement learning (RL) method for automatic parameter adjustment. Our approach includes two main components: a front-end policy network and a back-end asynchronous controller. The policy network selects appropriate parameters for the trajectory planner, while a discriminator in a Conditional Generative Adversarial Network (CGAN) evaluates the planned trajectory, using this evaluation as an imitation reward in RL. The asynchronous controller is employed for high-frequency trajectory tracking. Experiments conducted in both simulation and real-world demonstrate that our proposed method significantly enhances the performance of classical algorithms. © 2016 IEEE.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85209577396&doi=10.1109%2fLRA.2024.3495454&partnerID=40&md5=c7d96b281cb9c26432d8ec3955d0eb23,IEEE Robotics and Automation Letters,2024
Illumination Distribution-Aware Thermal Pedestrian Detection,"Pedestrian detection is an important task in computer vision, which is also an important part of intelligent transportation systems. For privacy protection, thermal images are widely used in pedestrian detection problems. However, thermal pedestrian detection is challenging due to the significant effect of temperature variation on the illumination of images and that fine-grained illumination annotations are difficult to be acquired. The existing methods have attempted to exploit coarse-grained day/night labels, which however even hampers the model performance. In this work, we introduce a novel idea of regressing conditional thermal-visible feature distribution, dubbed as Illumination Distribution-Aware adaptation (IDA). The key idea is to predict the conditional visible feature distribution given a thermal image, subject to their pre-computed joint distribution. Specifically, we first estimate the thermal-visible feature joint distribution by constructing feature co-occurrence matrices, offering a conditional probability distribution for any given thermal image. With this pairing information, we then form a conditional probability distribution regression task for model optimization. Critically, as a model agnostic strategy, this allows the visible feature knowledge to be transferred to the thermal counterpart implicitly for learning more discriminating feature representation. Experiment results show that our method outperforms the prior art methods, which use extra illumination annotations. Besides, as a plug-in, our method can averagely reduce about 2% MR on KAIST dataset, and improve about 1% mAP on FLIR-aligned and Autonomous Vehicles datasets without extra calculation for test.

CMGFA: A BEV Segmentation Model Based on Cross-Modal Group-Mix Attention Feature Aggregator,"Bird's eye view (BEV) segmentation map is a recent development in autonomous driving that provides effective environmental information, such as drivable areas and lane dividers. Most of the existing methods use cameras and LiDAR as inputs for segmentation and the fusion of different modalities is accomplished through either concatenation or addition operations, which fails to exploit fully the correlation and complementarity between modalities. This letter presents the CMGFA (Cross-Modal Group-mix attention Feature Aggregator), an end-to-end learning framework that can adapt to multiple modal feature combinations for BEV segmentation. The CMGFA comprises the following components: i) The camera has a dual-branch structure that strengthens the linkage between local and global features. ii) Multi-head deformable cross-attention is applied as cross-modal feature aggregators to aggregate camera, LiDAR, and Radar feature maps in BEV for implicit fusion. iii) The Group-Mix attention is used to enrich the attention map feature space and enhance the ability to segment between different categories. We evaluate our proposed method on the nuScenes and Argoverse2 datasets, where the CMGFA significantly outperforms the baseline.  © 2024 IEEE.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85209544884&doi=10.1109%2fLRA.2024.3495376&partnerID=40&md5=0d01343f96414564732bdeeff06b8c5a,IEEE Robotics and Automation Letters,2024
Joint Path Planning for Multiple Automated Vehicles in Lane-Free Traffic With Vehicle Nudging,"This article presents a joint trajectory optimization algorithm for a number of connected and automated vehicles in a lane-free traffic environment with vehicle nudging. A double double-integrator model is utilized for the longitudinal and lateral movements of each vehicle. The objective function consists of several sub-objectives that reflect corresponding, partially competing driving aspects and concerns, including passenger comfort, low fuel consumption, vehicle advancing at desired speed, collision avoidance, suppressing of infeasible maneuvers. Fixed and state-dependent control input bounds account for various technical limitations as well as for road boundary respect. The solution of the formulated joint Optimal Control Problem (OCP) is computed by use of a very efficient Feasible Direction Algorithm, which exploits the structure of the state equations to map the OCP into a reduced Nonlinear Programming Problem. To demonstrate the efficiency of the proposed approach, challenging scenarios are examined on a lane-free straight motorway stretch. The results of the centralized (joint) OCP are compared with a previously investigated decentralized approach where OCPs are employed separately for individual vehicles.  © 2024 IEEE.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85209348665&doi=10.1109%2fTITS.2024.3445501&partnerID=40&md5=6c9d9d39aba4a95d88a64f6b29a7bbe8,IEEE Transactions on Intelligent Transportation Systems,2024
Interval Type-2 Fuzzy Path Tracking Control for Autonomous Ground Vehicles Under Switched Triggered and Sensor Attacks,"This article focuses on the path tracking control problem for autonomous ground vehicles under switched triggered and sensor attacks. Firstly, an interval type-2 Takagi-Sugeno fuzzy model is established to effectively approximate the tire dynamic nonlinearities and varying velocity in the path tracking control system, in which the random deception attack encountered in the sensor is considered. Secondly, a novel switched triggered communication mechanism is presented to decrease the frequency of signal transmission and save the network resources. The switched triggered mechanism includes both the time-triggered mode and event-triggered mode, which obey a Bernoulli distribution. Then, based on a positive Lyapunov-Krasovskii functional and matrix inequalities, a set of conditions are developed for the path tracking controller design to achieve the asymptotic stability and performance requirements. Finally, experimental results are presented to evaluate and validate the performance of the proposed path tracking control method.  © 2024 IEEE.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85209389441&doi=10.1109%2fTITS.2024.3450182&partnerID=40&md5=2f15cb13c281bf487cfe643dbff418c4,IEEE Transactions on Intelligent Transportation Systems,2024
ReCAP: Protecting Cooperative Adaptive Cruise Control Against Multi-Channel Perception Adversary,"Cooperative Adaptive Cruise Control (CACC) is a fundamental connected vehicle application. In CACC, a vehicle coordinates its longitudinal movements to safely and efficiently follow the vehicle in front. The follower vehicle relies on a combination of sensory and communication inputs to identify the position, velocity, and acceleration of the preceding vehicle. Malicious subversion of these inputs can cause catastrophic accidents, string instability, and disruption in the transportation infrastructure. In this paper, we develop a security system, ReCAP, to provide real-time resiliency in CACC against adversarial subversion of both sensory and communication inputs. ReCAP makes use of a combination of techniques based on kinematics and machine learning to detect anomalous inputs, narrow down the source of subversion, and perform mitigation.

FedRSU: Federated Learning for Scene Flow Estimation on Roadside Units,"Roadside unit (RSU) can significantly improve the safety and robustness of autonomous vehicles through Vehicle-to-Everything (V2X) communication. Currently, the usage of a single RSU mainly focuses on real-time inference and V2X collaboration, while neglecting the potential value of the high-quality data collected by RSU sensors. Integrating the vast amounts of data from numerous RSUs can provide a rich source of data for model training. However, the absence of ground truth annotations and the difficulty of transmitting enormous volumes of data are two inevitable barriers to fully exploiting this hidden value. In this paper, we introduce FedRSU, an innovative federated learning framework for self-supervised scene flow estimation. In FedRSU, we present a recurrent self-supervision training paradigm, where for each RSU, the scene flow prediction of points at every timestamp can be supervised by its subsequent future multi-modality observation. Another key component of FedRSU is federated learning, where multiple devices collaboratively train an ML model while keeping the training data local and private. With the power of the recurrent self-supervised learning paradigm, FL is able to leverage innumerable underutilized data from RSU. To verify the FedRSU framework, we construct a large-scale multi-modality dataset RSU-SF. The dataset consists of 17 RSU clients and an additional 4 vehicle clients, covering various scenarios, modalities, and sensor settings. Based on RSU-SF, we show that FedRSU can greatly improve model performance in ITS and provide a comprehensive benchmark under diverse FL scenarios. To the best of our knowledge, we provide the first real-world LiDAR-camera multi-modal dataset and benchmark for the FL community.

Adapting Image Classification Adversarial Detection Methods for Traffic Sign Classification in Autonomous Vehicles: A Comparative Study,"Autonomous driving systems critically depend on accurately classifying traffic signs, a task that is jeopardized by adversarial attacks. This paper focuses on the relatively unexplored domain of Traffic Sign Classification (TSC) in the context of detecting adversarial attacks. We conduct a rigorous evaluation of six prominent adversarial example detection methods, each representing a distinct detection category and well-regarded within the research community. Our methodology involves adapting these techniques, originally developed for general image classification (IC), to the unique challenges posed by traffic sign images, characterized by their complexity due to factors like varying environmental conditions and a large number of classes. Our study reveals insights into their effectiveness, with the Natural Scene Statistics (NSS) method outperforming others with 83.42%, 86.42%, and 99.96% detection rates; 0.08%, 0.05%, and 0.04%, false positive rates; and 0.02sec, 0.01sec, and 0.02sec detection times for Chinese, Belgium and German traffic sign datasets, respectively. NSS’s superiority is crucial for autonomous vehicles. Our study also sheds light on the often-neglected aspect of detection time in IC, which plays a vital role in ensuring operational efficiency and safety for autonomous vehicles. Our research highlights the need for customized defense strategies tailored to the TSC domain, considering our evaluation’s findings. By identifying promising techniques for detecting adversarial attacks in TSC, we contribute to enhancing the safety and robustness of autonomous driving systems. This study fills a critical knowledge gap, providing valuable insights into understanding and defending against adversarial attacks, specifically in the TSC context. © 2000-2011 IEEE.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85208689719&doi=10.1109%2fTITS.2024.3435715&partnerID=40&md5=1dc023aba375dc2afde8a4f866e5dce8,IEEE Transactions on Intelligent Transportation Systems,2024
Analytical Characterization of Cyberattacks on Adaptive Cruise Control Vehicles,"While automated vehicles (AVs) are expected to revolutionize future transportation systems, emerging AV technologies also open the door for malicious actors to compromise intelligent vehicles. As the first generation of AVs, adaptive cruise control (ACC) vehicles are particularly vulnerable to cyberattacks. Although recent efforts have been made to understand the impact of attacks on transportation systems, little work has been done to systematically model and characterize the malicious nature of these attacks. In this study, we develop a general framework for modeling and synthesizing two types of candidate attacks on ACC vehicles: direct attacks on vehicle control commands and false data injection attacks on sensor measurements, with explicit characterization of their adverse effects. Based on linear stability analysis of car-following dynamics, we derive analytical conditions that characterize the malicious nature of potential attacks. This ensures a higher degree of realism in modeling attacks with adverse effects, as opposed to simply considering constant or random attacks. The conditions derived provide an effective method for synthesizing strategic candidate attacks on ACC vehicles. We conduct extensive simulations to examine the impacts of intelligently designed attacks on microscopic car-following dynamics and macroscopic traffic flow. Numerical results illustrate the attack mechanism, offering useful insights into understanding the vulnerability of future transportation systems. The methodology developed allows for further study of the widespread impact of strategically designed attacks on traffic cybersecurity, inspiring the development of efficient attack detection techniques and advanced vehicle controls. © 2024 IEEE.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85208710594&doi=10.1109%2fTITS.2024.3428988&partnerID=40&md5=a9652cb83d8763eb81848c487ab920bb,IEEE Transactions on Intelligent Transportation Systems,2024
BEV-TP: End-to-End Visual Perception and Trajectory Prediction for Autonomous Driving,"For autonomous vehicles (AVs), the ability for effective end-to-end perception and future trajectory prediction is critical in planning a safe automatic maneuver. In the current AVs systems, perception and prediction are two separate modules. The prediction module receives only a restricted amount of information from the perception module. Furthermore, perception errors will propagate into the prediction module, ultimately having a negative impact on the accuracy of the prediction results. In this paper, we present a novel framework termed BEV-TP, a visual context-guided center-based transformer network for joint 3D perception and trajectory prediction. BEV-TP exploits visual information from consecutive multi-view images and context information from HD semantic maps, to predict better objects’ centers whose locations are then used to query visual features and context features via the attention mechanism. Generated agent queries and map queries facilitate learning of the transformer module for further feature aggregation. Finally, multiple regression heads are used to perform 3D bounding box detection and future velocity prediction. This center-based approach achieves a differentiable, simple, and efficient E2E trajectory prediction framework. Extensive experiments conducted on the nuScenes dataset demonstrate the effectiveness of BEV-TP over traditional pipelines with sequential paradigms. © 2000-2011 IEEE.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85208807362&doi=10.1109%2fTITS.2024.3433591&partnerID=40&md5=e7ccd7f03435c65940470b0342f9f833,IEEE Transactions on Intelligent Transportation Systems,2024
Intelligent Finite-Time Protocol-Based Stabilization for Networked UMV Systems With DoS Attacks,"This study concentrates on the finite-time protocol-based stabilization for networked unmanned marine vehicle (UMV) systems with denial-of-service (DoS) attacks. To save limited communication resources, a novel event-driven protocol is proposed, in which Q-learning mechanism is adopted to adjust the threshold of the driven condition intelligently. In light of aperiodic DoS attacks, the corresponding switched system is constructed in light of the average dwell time strategy. Employing switching Lyapunov functional, sufficient conditions are made for finite-time boundedness of the UMV systems with disturbance, respectively, in which the relationship among the DoS parameter, the triggered parameter, the finite-time parameter, and the sampling period is accurately characterized. Moreover, the co-design approach of driven parameter and controller gain is proposed for the corresponding UMV systems. Finally, the benchmark UMV systems are shown to verify the effectiveness of the proposed strategy. © 2000-2011 IEEE.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85208691185&doi=10.1109%2fTITS.2024.3432919&partnerID=40&md5=afc47c49542e1cb1e73dd82f9b25c997,IEEE Transactions on Intelligent Transportation Systems,2024
A Novel Machine Learning-Based Trust Management Against Multiple Misbehaviors for Connected and Automated Vehicles,"Connected and Automated Vehicles (CAVs) are exposed to various threats in the dynamic, open and multidomain network. Applying machine learning-based trust management for CAVs becomes imperative to capture complex features and adapt to dynamic situations. To deal with multiple misbehaviors and real traffic scenarios challenges, a trust management method for CAVs is proposed with data fusion, trust factor computation and two-tier trust prediction. First of all, three types of features on CAVs are analyzed, including spatio-temporal logic features, behavioral features and traffic flow features. Then, data fusion methods that combine beacon messages with map and detector data are proposed to enhance trust-related data. A multi-dimensional trust factor computation approach is then introduced using statistical methods. Finally, per-minute and multi-minute machine learning-based trust prediction methods are performed at the node level using the computed trust labels from each beacon. The results showed the effectiveness and real-time capability of the data fusion process, as well as the completeness of the trust factor computation. The trust prediction results showed both high performance at the per-minute level with models like XGBoost and further improved performance at the multi-minute level with deep learning models. © 2000-2011 IEEE.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85208739628&doi=10.1109%2fTITS.2024.3422423&partnerID=40&md5=d4aadfd2f08c9db18f2c3c2696a14a9a,IEEE Transactions on Intelligent Transportation Systems,2024
Exploring Diversity-Based Active Learning for 3D Object Detection in Autonomous Driving,"3D object detection has recently received much attention due to its great potential in autonomous vehicle (AV). The success of deep learning based object detectors relies on the availability of large-scale annotated datasets, which is time-consuming and expensive to compile, especially for 3D bounding box annotation. In this work, we investigate diversity-based active learning (AL) as a potential solution to alleviate the annotation burden. Given limited annotation budget, only the most informative frames and objects are automatically selected for human to annotate. Technically, we take the advantage of the multimodal information provided in an AV dataset, and propose a novel acquisition function that enforces spatial and temporal diversity in the selected samples. We benchmark the proposed method against other AL strategies under realistic annotation cost measurements, where the realistic costs for annotating a frame and a 3D bounding box are both taken into consideration. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method on the nuScenes dataset and show that it outperforms existing AL strategies significantly.  © 2024 IEEE.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85208260767&doi=10.1109%2fTITS.2024.3463801&partnerID=40&md5=274c04934a506fdf5385f1673cf0d27d,IEEE Transactions on Intelligent Transportation Systems,2024
Human-Vehicle Shared Steering Control for Obstacle Avoidance: A Reference-Free Approach with Reinforcement Learning,"Although artificial intelligence has made tremendous progress recently, there remain various technical issues and ethical problems before autonomous vehicles can be available to the general public. In the interim, collaboration between automated systems and human drivers becomes a promising solution, where the merits of machine intelligence and human intelligence are blended in a complementary way. To this end, the paper proposes a reference-free human-vehicle shared control framework based on reinforcement learning. Firstly, a personalized human-like driver agent is derived from highway driving data by means of generative adversarial imitation learning integrated with Gaussian mixture model. The driver model is responsible for real-time interaction with the reinforcement learning agent to relieve the burden of human operators in the course of training. Then, a copilot agent learns the policies to cooperatively control the vehicle steering based on three distinct implementations for the search of the best coordination strategy. Heuristic reward functions are designed to guide the agent policy optimization for multi-objective equilibrium between driver synchronization against intervention. To verify the control performance of the proposed shared driving system, simulation experiments with driver models and human-in-the-loop tests with real-life participants are conducted in the end of this paper. The results demonstrate that the shared steering control method can effectively follow human intentions, facilitate driving goals, improve road safety and reduce driver's workload simultaneously in the challenging dynamic obstacle avoidance scenarios.  © 2000-2011 IEEE.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85209104102&doi=10.1109%2fTITS.2024.3420894&partnerID=40&md5=0b63a5776518b7a8f1521c7d734d8134,IEEE Transactions on Intelligent Transportation Systems,2024
Joint Scene Flow Estimation and Moving Object Segmentation on Rotational LiDAR Data,"LiDAR-based scene flow estimation (SFE) and moving object segmentation (MOS) are important tasks with broad-ranging applications in autonomous driving, such as traffic surveillance, motion analysis, obstacle avoidance, etc. Most existing works address SFE and MOS separately, ignoring the underlying shared geometric constraints and their inherent correlation. This article rethinks LiDAR-based SFE and MOS tasks, providing our key insight that jointly addressing them can tackle challenges in both tasks, and their solutions can reinforce one another to improve the performance of both. Based on this insight, we introduce a novel framework that exploits shared geometric constraints by explicitly partitioning the scene into static and moving regions and subsequently estimating flow differently for these regions. A lightweight and interpretable neural network dubbed SFEMOS is proposed. It employs an encoder and two specially designed head modules for each task, achieving MOS without relying on prior poses and online point-wise flow estimation for 360-degree point clouds. Due to the absence of public datasets for concurrently evaluating both tasks, we generate ground truth flow data using MOS labels from SemanticKITTI. Additionally, we establish a new dataset using a rotational LiDAR mounted on our own autonomous vehicle. Evaluation results on both datasets validate the superior performance of our proposed SFEMOS.

High-Sample-Efficient Multiagent Reinforcement Learning for Navigation and Collision Avoidance of UAV Swarms in Multitask Environments,"Multiagent reinforcement learning (MARL) algorithms have shown promise in the Internet of Things devices, such as unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) swarms. However, the dynamic nature of large-scale swarm systems, with constantly changing numbers of agents and observed neighbors, poses challenges for MARL adaptation. Existing approaches struggle to extract meaningful features and require a substantial number of experience samples, resulting in low-sample efficiency and high-risk ratios. Moreover, these methods are effective in task-specific scenarios and fail to perform well in multitask settings. To overcome these challenges, this study proposes a high-sample efficient and scalable MARL approach for UAV swarms. The proposed approach incorporates a hypernetwork-based embedding attention (HEA) mechanism for the state representation of the policy network and a multiencoder gated transformer with a multilayer attention (MEGTrMA) mechanism for the value function. The HEA automatically generates weights for each agent to adapt to dynamic scenarios, enhancing representation ability and adaptability while reducing the cost of trial and error for improved learning efficiency. The MEGTrMA captures the contribution of each agent to the global observation, establishing long-term dependencies among them and facilitating stable policy learning in multitask scenarios. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed method is scalable, generalizable, and high-sample efficient. Compared to learning from scratch, our method significantly reduces training time to less than one-fifth of the initial time by progressively increasing the number of UAVs and their corresponding neighbors. Additionally, the average number of collisions is reduced by an order of magnitude for large-scale UAV swarms. © 2014 IEEE.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85208751946&doi=10.1109%2fJIOT.2024.3409169&partnerID=40&md5=a6ca27232af96360eda27fd428264a4d,IEEE Internet of Things Journal,2024
Human-Inspired Anticipative Cruise Control for Enhancing Mixed Traffic Flow,"Introducing the human driver’s intelligence of interpreting and anticipating preceding traffic conditions into automated driving control is crucial for improved driving experience. Existing human-like automated driving systems imitate human driver’s reactive control patterns without reflecting anticipative behaviors. These systems involve either online solving predictive optimization or offline training machine learning techniques, which are computationally expensive and impractical for current production vehicles. Additionally, these systems are less effective in traffic environments with lean vehicular connectivity. This paper proposes a practical human-inspired anticipative cruise control for connected automated vehicles (CAVs) that not only respects human drivers’ reactive driving preferences but exploits their anticipative capabilities to enhance mixed traffic flow. Two major contributions are (i) learning the reactive control objective from a segment of the human driving trajectory based on a recovery matrix; and (ii) data-enabled preceding traffic anticipation leveraging the behavioral theory of linear systems, which provides the estimated motion of immediate preceding vehicle (IPV) at a personalized anticipation horizon, considering the downstream traffic trends from a distant connected human-driven vehicle (CHV). The proposed control strategy is evaluated on a human-in-the-loop (HiL) driving simulator. Results validate its real-time implementation potential in (a) learning human-like reactive driving control; (b) improving traffic flow energy economy by 4.58%; (c) enhancing traffic efficiency by attenuating latent traffic fluctuations. Moreover, result reveals that the capability of mitigating traffic fluctuations is affected by the anticipation horizon, which can be adaptably learned from human driver’s timely guidance by virtue of their intelligence of adaptability to dynamic traffic conditions. © 2000-2011 IEEE.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85208698690&doi=10.1109%2fTITS.2024.3438211&partnerID=40&md5=10928d58adc8f99c1fbb8d6b209a6b7f,IEEE Transactions on Intelligent Transportation Systems,2024
A Secure Personalized Federated Learning Algorithm for Autonomous Driving,"Federated learning (FL) is a promising technology for autonomous driving, enabling connected and autonomous vehicles (CAVs) to collaborate in decision-making and environmental perception while preserving privacy.

Specifically, we first propose a personalized local training round allocation algorithm to balance energy costs and accelerate model convergence. Next, in order to further guarantee security, we embed an attack module based on Gini impurity.

A Bounded Rationality-Aware Car-Following Strategy for Alleviating Cut-In Events and Traffic Disturbances in Traffic Oscillations,"Neighboring human-driven vehicles (HDVs) frequently perform uncertain cut-in maneuvers, posing a threat to the safety and efficiency of autonomous vehicles (AVs), particularly in traffic oscillation scenarios characterized by AVs experiencing speed disturbances. In this paper, we propose an AV car-following strategy based on bounded rationality-aware reinforcement learning (BRARL) to handle cut-in maneuvers. The approach can handle scenarios involving simultaneous cut-in preclusion and cut-in yielding. Considering the limited rationality of human drivers during lane change, this strategy incorporates a bounded rationality-based game process to restrict discretionary cut-ins while safeguarding AV's interests, including efficiency, safety, and comfort. The well-designed RL framework captures the exhibited randomness of both the cut-in and preceding HDVs, enabling the AV to effectively handle cut-in maneuvers and reduce speed disturbances. Simulated experiments demonstrate the high generalization capability of our strategy in reducing preceding speed disturbances (e.g., achieving a minimum reduction of 34.5% in traffic disturbances compared to two baselines), and preventing discretionary cut-in maneuvers.  © 2000-2011 IEEE.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85209103909&doi=10.1109%2fTITS.2024.3424447&partnerID=40&md5=10ecb3365a9820a14134bc417b47a293,IEEE Transactions on Intelligent Transportation Systems,2024

To obtain high exploration efficiency, we propose a large-region-aware exploration route optimization strategy that prioritizes exploring large regions while also considering exploring nearby small regions. To safely and completely explore uneven terrains, our planner fully introduces traversability information to extract unknown regions and assess exploration safety levels. The safety levels are then integrated into the design of the exploration strategy to ensure safe robotic exploration.

Path Planning Optimization of Smart Vehicle With Fast Converging Distance-Dependent PSO Algorithm,"Path planning is a crucial technology and challenge in various fields, including robotics, autonomous systems, and intelligent transportation systems. The Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) algorithm is widely used for optimization problems due to its simplicity and efficiency. However, despite its potential, PSO has notable limitations, such as slow convergence, susceptibility to local minima, and suboptimal efficiency, which restrict its application. This paper proposed a novel strategy called the Distance-Dependent Sigmoidal Inertia Weight PSO (DSI-PSO) algorithm to address slow convergence in path planning optimization. This innovative algorithm is inspired by neural network activation functions to achieve faster convergence. In DSI-PSO, each particle computes a distance metric and leverages a sigmoid function to adaptively update its inertia weight. Beyond improving convergence speed, this approach also addresses path-planning challenges in autonomous vehicles. In intelligent transportation systems, effective path planning enables smart vehicles to navigate, select optimal routes, and make informed decisions. The goal is to identify a collision-free path that satisfies key criteria such as shortest distance and smoothness. This methodology not only accelerates convergence but also maintains a balance between exploration and exploitation. The effectiveness of the DSI-PSO algorithm is tested using thirteen distinct unimodal and multimodal benchmark functions, serving as rigorous test cases. Additionally, the algorithm's realworld applicability is evaluated through a smart vehicle simulation, assessing its ability to identify safe and efficient paths while minimizing overall path length. The results demonstrate the superiority of the DSI-PSO algorithm over conventional PSO approaches, with significantly enhanced convergence rates and robust optimization performance.  © 2020 IEEE.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85207910831&doi=10.1109%2fOJITS.2024.3486155&partnerID=40&md5=fe822c5ad9baffa0d5b821a152a32083,IEEE Open Journal of Intelligent Transportation Systems,2024
Leveraging Single-Bounce Reflections and Onboard Motion Sensors for Enhanced 5G Positioning,"5G-based mmWave wireless positioning has emerged as a promising solution for autonomous vehicle (AV) positioning in recent years. Previous studies have highlighted the benefits of fusing line-of-sight (LoS) 5G signals with an Inertial Navigation System (INS) for an improved positioning solution. However, the highly dynamic environment of urban areas, where AVs are expected to operate, poses a challenge, as non-line-of-sight (NLoS) communication can deteriorate the 5G mmWave positioning solution and lead to erroneous corrections to the INS. To address this challenge, we exploit 5G single-bounce reflections (SBRs) and LoS signals to improve positioning performance in dense urban environments. In addition, we integrate the proposed 5G-based positioning with a low-cost inertial measurement unit (IMU) and a wheel encoder. Moreover, the integration is realized using an unscented Kalman filter (UKF) as an alternative to the widely utilized extended Kalman filter (EKF) within the 5G-based positioning research community. We performed two test trajectories in the dense urban environment of downtown Toronto, Canada. For each trajectory, quasi-real 5G measurements were generated using a ray-tracing tool incorporating 3D map scans of real-world buildings, allowing for realistic NLoS and multipath scenarios. For the same trajectories, real motion data were collected from two different low-cost IMUs. Our integrated positioning solution was capable of maintaining a level of accuracy below 30 cm for approximately 97% of the time, which is superior to the accuracy level achieved when SBR signals are not considered, which is only around 92% of the time. © 2024 IEEE.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85207888526&doi=10.1109%2fTITS.2024.3480525&partnerID=40&md5=e5f26c0b7b6647829059f9fe7f0f1d63,IEEE Transactions on Intelligent Transportation Systems,2024
A Balanced Collision Avoidance Algorithm for USVs in Complex Environment: A Deep Reinforcement Learning Approach,"The collision avoidance in real-time is crucial for unmanned surface vehicles (USVs) in a complex environment. Traditional methods make it hard to ensure the balance of control decisions. To balance safety and practicality, a collision avoidance algorithm based on deep reinforcement learning (DRL) and a two-level incentive reward based on the principle of complementarity is proposed. To address the vital sparse reward problem of Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient (DDPG), the trajectory evaluation function of the dynamic window algorithm (DWA) is referred to construct the primary reward strategy, and a secondary incentive reward is constructed based on velocity obstacle (VO) to eliminate potential collision risks.

A Secure Self-Certified Broadcast Authentication Protocol for Intelligent Transportation Systems in UAV-Assisted Mobile Edge Computing Environments,"Unmanned Aerial Vehicle(UAV)-assisted mobile edge computing(MEC) ensures continuous MEC services by promptly restoring overloaded or disabled MEC infrastructure. Equipped with sufficient computing resources, UAVs deploy to areas needing MEC, such as task offloading and entertainment services. However, in areas with paralyzed edge nodes, vehicle users are unable to verify the legitimacy of UAVs as they cannot access to the trusted authority(TA). Furthermore, the integrity of UAV-assisted MEC environments can be compromised by malicious attackers, as all network participants rely on wireless communication for their interactions. Many authentication schemes have been proposed for UAV environments. However, these schemes encounter a problem of having to communicate through TA for authentication with vehicle users, which makes them difficult to apply to UAV-assisted MEC environments. Therefore, we propose a new broadcast authentication protocol, which can recover MEC services using MEC-equipped UAVs. The proposed protocol can provide UAVs and vehicle users with high reliability via a self-certified public-key cryptosystem, which can verify the legitimacy of the communication partner without the TA. Moreover, we guarantee the user privacy and preserve sensitive information using biohash technology. We verify the security robustness of the proposed protocol using various simulation tool, informal, and formal analyses. We also estimate the practical deployment of the proposed protocol using 'Network Simulator-3'. Moreover, we estimate the computation and communication overheads and compare with other existing protocols. The results show that the proposed protocol is feasible and provides users with convenient and seamless intelligent transportation services in UAV-assisted MEC environments. © 2000-2011 IEEE.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85207630323&doi=10.1109%2fTITS.2024.3428491&partnerID=40&md5=4148f1b1dc89b2e2029292558980b504,IEEE Transactions on Intelligent Transportation Systems,2024
Kernel-Based Metrics Learning for Uncertain Opponent Vehicle Trajectory Prediction in Autonomous Racing,"Autonomous racing confronts significant challenges in safely overtaking Opponent Vehicles (OVs) that exhibit uncertain trajectories, stemming from unknown driving policies. To address these challenges, this study proposes heterogeneous kernel metrics for Deep Kernel Learning (DKL), designed to robustly capture the diverse driving policies of OVs, and carry out precise trajectory predictions along with the associated uncertainties. A key virtue of the proposed kernel metrics lies in their ability to align similar driving policies and disjoin dissimilar ones in an unsupervised manner, given the observed interactions between the Ego Vehicle (EV) and OVs. The efficacy of the proposed method is substantiated through experimental studies on a 1/10th scale racecar platform, demonstrating improved prediction accuracy and thereby safely overtaking against OVs. Furthermore, our method is computationally efficient for onboard computing units, affirming its viability in fast-paced racing environments.  © 2016 IEEE.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85207895334&doi=10.1109%2fLRA.2024.3486178&partnerID=40&md5=8eb602fee747a12232e9b5b9c56716ee,IEEE Robotics and Automation Letters,2024
Dynamic Event-Triggered Fuzzy Adaptive Resilient Consensus Control for Nonlinear MASs under DoS Attacks,"In this article, the adaptive fuzzy dynamic event-triggered output feedback resilient consensus control issue is investigated for nonlinear multiagent systems (MASs) subject to denial-of-service (DoS) attacks. Fuzzy logic systems (FLSs) are employed to model uncertain agents, and a state observer is constructed to estimate unmeasurable states. An event-triggered distributed resilient observer is designed to save the communication resources between agents, and estimate the unknown leader and its high-order derivatives in case of the communication topology being interrupted by DoS attacks. By the designed state observer and distributed resilient observer, a dynamic event-triggered resilient consensus control method is presented. It is proved that the controlled MASs are stable, and the followers can track the leader under DoS attacks. Moreover, the Zeno behavior can be excluded. Finally, we apply the developed resilient consensus control algorithm to multiple unmanned surface vehicles (USVs), the simulation results verify its effectiveness.  © 2024 IEEE.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85207047382&doi=10.1109%2fTSMC.2024.3426931&partnerID=40&md5=e1cbaed1b6de58c155f03f0df8b59b46,"IEEE Transactions on Systems, Man, and Cybernetics: Systems",2024
UADA3D: Unsupervised Adversarial Domain Adaptation for 3D Object Detection With Sparse LiDAR and Large Domain Gaps,"In this study, we address a gap in existing unsupervised domain adaptation approaches on LiDAR-based 3D object detection, which have predominantly concentrated on adapting between established, high-density autonomous driving datasets. We focus on sparser point clouds, capturing scenarios from different perspectives: not just from vehicles on the road but also from mobile robots on sidewalks, which encounter significantly different environmental conditions and sensor configurations. We introduce Unsupervised Adversarial Domain Adaptation for 3D Object Detection (UADA3D). UADA3D does not depend on pre-trained source models or teacher-student architectures. Instead, it uses an adversarial approach to directly learn domain-invariant features. We demonstrate its efficacy in various adaptation scenarios, showing significant improvements in both self-driving car and mobile robot domains.  © 2016 IEEE.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85208094064&doi=10.1109%2fLRA.2024.3487489&partnerID=40&md5=2bbdbf60e563baff28fce37b8f37d837,IEEE Robotics and Automation Letters,2024
Cooperative Localization for Asynchronous AUVs Using Time Difference of Communication in Underwater Anchor-Free Environments,"The asynchronization among autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs) is inevitable due to the inherent offsets and drifts in clocks, which critically degrades the accuracy of AUV cooperative localization (CL), especially in underwater anchor-free environments. This article designs a novel relative measurement representation called time difference of communication (TDOC) to eliminate the impact of asynchronization, which only requires one-way inter-AUV communications at different time steps even in the presence of large asynchronization. By exploiting TDOC, a joint spatial-temporal CL model is established with specially constructed measurement vectors, and a CL method, termed TDOC-CL, is proposed. It transforms the nonlinear observations into a weighted least-square (WLS) formation and is solved via iterative optimization, where various coupled uncertainties (i.e., measurement biases, measurement noises, and position errors) are involved and analyzed. Moreover, to compensate the accuracy degradation caused by the uncertainties, the TDOC-CL with bias reduction and error compensation, named iTDOC-CL-BREC, is further designed. In addition, the hybrid Cramér-Rao lower bound (HCRLB) is derived as the performance benchmark to evaluate the localization behaviors. Simulations and field experiments show that iTDOC-CL-BREC can provide higher localization accuracy compared with state-of-the-art methods, especially for long-duration tasks.  © 2013 IEEE.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85208204591&doi=10.1109%2fTCYB.2024.3447121&partnerID=40&md5=9eba7f9eedf6c67487044f91415db0f6,IEEE Transactions on Cybernetics,2024
SwissCheese: Fine-Grained Channel-Spatial Feature Filtering for Communication-Efficient Cooperative Perception,"Cooperative perception is an effective way for connected autonomous vehicles (CAVs) to surpass their sensing limitations, by sharing information like intermediate features extracted from images or point clouds with each other. To reduce bandwidth consumption, feature filtering is adopted by existing methods to share only the most valuable information. However, these methods assume that the features on the same channel across all spatial regions or those in the same spatial regions across all the channels are equally important. This assumption results in coarse-grained feature filtering, which greatly decreases the cooperative perception performance. To solve this problem, this paper proposes a fine-grained channel-spatial feature filtering scheme, named SwissCheese, for communication-efficient cooperative perception. The key idea of SwissCheese is to exploit the disparity in semantic information on features between different spatial regions on different channels. Specifically, a fine-grained collaborative attention module is developed to jointly learn fine-grained attention along the channel-spatial dimensions. Moreover, a dual-dimensional feature selection strategy that selects sparse features for transmission based on the current available bandwidth is designed to achieve optimal perception performance. Experiment results show that SwissCheese significantly reduces the transmission data size by 90% with a subtle loss in perception performance. © 2024 IEEE.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85207868621&doi=10.1109%2fTITS.2024.3480359&partnerID=40&md5=cafe8fbaa6fd56dca7bb2a031b69606b,IEEE Transactions on Intelligent Transportation Systems,2024
Explainable AI for Safe and Trustworthy Autonomous Driving: A Systematic Review,"Artificial Intelligence (AI) shows promising applications for the perception and planning tasks in autonomous driving (AD) due to its superior performance compared to conventional methods. However, highly complex AI systems exacerbate the existing challenge of safety assurance of AD. One way to mitigate this challenge is to utilize explainable AI (XAI) techniques. To this end, we present the first comprehensive systematic literature review of explainable methods for safe and trustworthy AD. We begin by analyzing the requirements for AI in the context of AD, focusing on three key aspects: data, model, and agency. We find that XAI is fundamental to meeting these requirements. Based on this, we explain the sources of explanations in AI and describe a taxonomy of XAI. We then identify five key contributions of XAI for safe and trustworthy AI in AD, which are interpretable design, interpretable surrogate models, interpretable monitoring, auxiliary explanations, and interpretable validation. Finally, we propose a conceptual modular framework called SafeX to integrate the reviewed methods, enabling explanation delivery to users while simultaneously ensuring the safety of AI models.  © 2000-2011 IEEE.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85207766711&doi=10.1109%2fTITS.2024.3474469&partnerID=40&md5=b6d9a2e49f4de2bdeeac474dd431439f,IEEE Transactions on Intelligent Transportation Systems,2024
RLBA-UAV: A Robust and Lightweight Blockchain-Based Authentication and Key Agreement Scheme for PUF-Enabled UAVs,"Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) integrated with the internet of things (IoT) guarantee useful advantages such as facilitating ground communications in regions where the availability of connectivity is restricted owing to physical obstacles. However, the data transmitted by sensors and IoT embedded in UAVs are facing new security issues and privacy challenges with the known security attacks over time. To address these security attacks and threats and meet lightweight UAV communication requirements, a secure and lightweight authentication and key agreement (AKA) scheme is essential. Recently, researchers have designed a lightweight blockchain-enabled AKA scheme with privacy-preserving for UAVs to provide useful and reliable services. However, we prove that the existing scheme is fragile to various security attacks and does not ensure mutual authentication. Thus, we propose a robust and lightweight blockchain-based AKA scheme for PUF-enabled UAVs, called RLBA-UAV to enhance the security problems of the existing scheme. We demonstrate the security of RLBA-UAV by using informal/formal security analyses such as the ROR oracle model and AVISPA simulation. Moreover, we demonstrate the performance comparison analysis between RLBA-UAV and related schemes for UAVs. We demonstrate an implementation of a network simulator (NS) 3 compliant with IEEE 802.11p standards to show its validation and feasibility that RLBA-UAV is appropriate for practical UAVs. Thus, RLBA-UAV offers enhanced security and operational efficiency compared to related schemes and can be applied to practical blockchain-based AKA systems for UAVs.  © 2000-2011 IEEE.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85207888166&doi=10.1109%2fTITS.2024.3480029&partnerID=40&md5=bd4c9664f9f23cbcb26bb97461ace75c,IEEE Transactions on Intelligent Transportation Systems,2024
A Cyberattack Detection-Isolation Algorithm for CAV Under Changing Driving Environment,"Under a changing driving environment, a Connected Autonomous Vehicle (CAV) platoon relies strongly on the acquisition of accurate traffic information from neighboring vehicles as well as reliable commands from a centralized supervisory controller through the communication network. Even though such modalities are imperative to ensure the safe and efficient driving performance of CAVs, they led to multiple security challenges. Thus, a cyberattack on this network can corrupt vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) and vehicle-to-infrastructure (V2I) communication, which can lead to unsafe or undesired driving scenarios. Hence, in this paper, we propose a cyberattack detection-isolation algorithm comprised of a unified V2V and V2I cyberattack detection scheme along with a V2I isolation scheme for CAVs under changing driving conditions. The proposed algorithm is constructed using a bank of residual generators with Lyapunov function-based performance guarantees, such as disturbance-to-state stability, robustness, and sensitivity. Finally, we showcase the efficacy of our proposed algorithm through extensive Monte-Carlo simulations using real-world highway and urban driving data. The results show that the proposed algorithm can enhance the cybersecurity of CAVs by detecting cyberattacks on CAV platoons and isolating infrastructure-level traffic manipulation.  © 2000-2011 IEEE.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85207772720&doi=10.1109%2fTITS.2024.3475952&partnerID=40&md5=2e7e9dce58ed2928351730dabf4a00b1,IEEE Transactions on Intelligent Transportation Systems,2024
ReMAV: Reward Modeling of Autonomous Vehicles for Finding Likely Failure Events,"Autonomous vehicles are advanced driving systems that revolutionize transportation, but their vulnerability to adversarial attacks poses significant safety risks. Consider a scenario in which a slight perturbation in sensor data causes an autonomous vehicle to fail unexpectedly, potentially leading to accidents. Current testing methods often rely on computationally expensive active learning techniques to identify such vulnerabilities. Rather than actively training complex adversaries by interacting with the environment, there is a need to first intelligently find and reduce the search space to only those states where autonomous vehicles are found to be less confident. In this paper, we propose a black-box testing framework ReMAV that uses offline trajectories first to efficiently identify weaknesses of autonomous vehicles without the need for active interaction. To this end, we introduce a three-step methodology which i) uses offline state action pairs of any autonomous vehicle under test, ii) builds an abstract behavior representation using our designed reward modeling technique to analyze states with uncertain driving decisions, and iii) uses a disturbance model for minimal perturbation attacks where the driving decisions are less confident. Our reward modeling creates a behavior representation that highlights regions of likely uncertain autonomous vehicle behavior, even when performance seems adequate. This enables efficient testing without computationally expensive active adversarial learning. We evaluated ReMAV in a high-fidelity urban driving simulator across various single- and multi-agent scenarios. The results show substantial increases in failure events compared to the standard behavior of autonomous vehicles: 35% in vehicle collisions, 23% in road object collisions, 48% in pedestrian collisions, and 50% in off-road steering events. ReMAV outperforms two baselines and previous testing frameworks in effectiveness, efficiency, and speed of identifying failures. This demonstrates ReMAV's capability to efficiently expose autonomous vehicle weaknesses using simple perturbation models.  © 2024 The Authors.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85207005727&doi=10.1109%2fOJITS.2024.3479098&partnerID=40&md5=0a6f8645e0cbb9a031517a0a9421ca72,IEEE Open Journal of Intelligent Transportation Systems,2024
Latency-Free Driving Scene Prediction for On-Road Teledriving With Future-Image-Generation,"Teledriving could serve as a practical solution for handling unforeseen situations in autonomous driving. However, the latency of transmission networks remains a prominent concern. Despite advancements like 5G networks, delays in remote driving scenes cannot be entirely eradicated, potentially leading to unwanted incidents. While a few attempts have been made to address this issue by predicting the future driving scenes, these efforts have been restricted in their ability to accurately foresee clear and relevant driving scenarios. This study presents a method to predict a latency-free future driving scene. Unlike prior approaches, our method incorporates the command signal of a remote driver into the prediction network, as well as the past driving video frames and vehicle status. As a result, we can accurately predict relevant and clear latency-free future driving scenes. A combination of convolutional long short-term memory (ConvLSTM) and generative adversarial networks (GAN) was utilized in a deep neural network to predict the future driving scenes based on latency. The dataset was gathered from on-road teledriving experiments, with a maximum vehicle speed of 53 km/h and a driving route length of approximately 1.3 km. The dataset used to train the deep neural network was gathered from on-road teledriving experiments. The proposed method can estimate the future driving scene for up to 0.5 s, surpassing the performance of both baseline video prediction methods and a method that does not utilize the input command of the driver. ©2000-2011 IEEE.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85205786053&doi=10.1109%2fTITS.2024.3435481&partnerID=40&md5=197f1046b10e234e72d942d36d90a0a1,IEEE Transactions on Intelligent Transportation Systems,2024
Sociality Probe: Game-Theoretic Inverse Reinforcement Learning for Modeling and Quantifying Social Patterns in Driving Interaction,"Autonomous vehicles (AV) are consistently criticized for their inadequacies in harmoniously interacting with human-driven vehicles (HV), primarily attributed to the lack of sociality, a key human trait that balances individual and group rewards. Understanding sociality is essential for smooth AV navigation but remains challenging. To address this, we propose a Game-Theoretic Inverse Reinforcement Learning (GT-IRL) approach to quantify individualized sociality in driving interaction. Our approach identifies the sociality-preference parameters of a pre-designed reward function that integrates the ego agent's rewards and the group rewards shared by all the interacting agents. Instead of presuming an agent is propelled by the maximization of its own rewards, the game-theoretical mechanism is utilized within the IRL structure to capture the fact that human drivers take into account others' interests. We validated our method using human driving data from an unprotected left-turn scenario. The results demonstrate that the proposed GT-IRL outperforms state-of-the-art methods in better reproducing the evolution of the left-turn interaction at both semantic and trajectory levels. Additionally, cross-dataset analysis reveals variations in sociality due to geographical differences (China vs. the U.S.) and the nature of the interacting entities (AV vs. HV or HV vs. HV).  © 2000-2011 IEEE.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85205259058&doi=10.1109%2fTITS.2024.3461162&partnerID=40&md5=fb14487ed608c9a8dd813e6e24180c56,IEEE Transactions on Intelligent Transportation Systems,2024
DOEPatch: Dynamically Optimized Ensemble Model for Adversarial Patches Generation,"Object detection is a fundamental task in various applications ranging from autonomous driving to intelligent security systems. However, recognition of a person can be hindered when their clothing is decorated with carefully designed graffiti patterns, leading to the failure of object detection. To achieve greater attack potential against unknown black-box models, adversarial patches capable of affecting the outputs of multiple-object detection models are required. While ensemble models have proven effective, current research in the field of object detection typically focuses on the simple fusion of the outputs of all models, with limited attention being given to developing general adversarial patches that can function effectively in the physical world. In this paper, we introduce the concept of energy and treat the adversarial patches generation process as an optimization of the adversarial patches to minimize the total energy of the 'person' category. Additionally, by adopting adversarial training, we construct a dynamically optimized ensemble model. During training, the weight parameters of the attacked target models are adjusted to find the balance point at which the generated adversarial patches can effectively attack all target models. We carried out six sets of comparative experiments and tested our algorithm on five mainstream object detection models. The adversarial patches generated by our algorithm can reduce the recognition accuracy of YOLOv2 and YOLOv3 to 13.19% and 29.20%, respectively. In addition, we conducted experiments to test the effectiveness of T-shirts covered with our adversarial patches in the physical world and could achieve that people are not recognized by the object detection model. Finally, leveraging the Grad-CAM tool, we explored the attack mechanism of adversarial patches from an energetic perspective. © 2005-2012 IEEE.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85205300542&doi=10.1109%2fTIFS.2024.3468908&partnerID=40&md5=44d77b5aaf3b28d59ab6344d72d02cd3,IEEE Transactions on Information Forensics and Security,2024
VAuth: Robust Lightweight Mutual Authentication Protocol Preserving User's Anonymity for VANET With FPGA Implementation,"Many applications that are developed for the Intelligent Transport System to ensure safety, efficiency and comfort, depend on communication among mobile vehicular nodes, road side units, fog servers, and trusted authority.

Risk-Aware Net: An Explicit Collision-Constrained Framework for Enhanced Safety Autonomous Driving,"Motion planning is a vital part of autonomous driving. To ensure the safety of autonomous vehicles, motion planning algorithms need to precisely model potential collision risks and execute essential driving maneuvers. Drawing inspiration from the human driving process, which involves making preliminary decisions based on an initial assessment of the driving scenario and subsequently generating refined trajectories, this study presents a two-step framework to replicate this process. In the first step, we use a learning-based network to create an initial plan. To model potential collision risks, we introduce a corridor-based constraint that considers the environment and trajectory information. By combining imitation loss with corridor-constrained loss through supervised learning, we incorporate driving heuristics into the plan. In the second step, we refine the plan using an optimization-based pose refinement module. This module optimizes the trajectory at a point level to create the final, improved path. To validate our approach, we trained and evaluated our methodology using the large-scale Lyft dataset. The results show that our method outperforms other baseline approaches by reducing collision rates and discomfort rates.  © 2024 IEEE.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85205826472&doi=10.1109%2fLRA.2024.3471448&partnerID=40&md5=69ffcedc528d3659d747489330d4d096,IEEE Robotics and Automation Letters,2024

"A Survey on Recent Advancements in Autonomous Driving Using Deep Reinforcement Learning: Applications, Challenges, and Solutions","Autonomous driving (AD) endows vehicles with the capability to drive partly or entirely without human intervention. AD agents generate driving policies based on online perception results, which are crucial to the realization of safe, efficient, and comfortable driving behaviors, particularly in high-dimensional and stochastic traffic scenarios. Currently, deep reinforcement learning (DRL) techniques to derive and validate AD policies have witnessed vast research efforts and have shown rapid development in recent years. However, a comprehensive interpretation and evaluation of their strengths and limitations concerning the full-stack AD tasks remain uncharted. This paper presents a survey of this body of work, which is conducted at three levels. First, it analyzes the multi-level AD task characteristics and delves deeply into the current DRL methodologies primarily employed in AD. Second, a taxonomy of the literature studies is constructed from the system perspective, identifying six modes of DRL model integration into an AD architecture that span the entire spectrum of AD policy processes, from perception understanding and decision-making to motion control, as well as verification and validation. Each literature review comprehensively encompasses the main elements of designing such a system, including modeling partially observable environments, state and action spaces, reward structuring, and the design and training methodologies of neural network models.

BASUV: A Blockchain-Enabled UAV Authentication Scheme for Internet of Vehicles,"Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) have emerged as pivotal roles within internet of vehicles (IoV), serving as mobile base stations. However, while expanding coverage and improving mobility, the deployment of UAVs also poses a threat to the integrity and privacy of sensitive data due to open wireless communication channels in IoV. Therefore, preventing unauthorized access and data tampering is critically important between UAVs and vehicles. For the authenticity and legitimacy of the UAV certificate, existing authentication approaches may lead to significant challenges in key management overhead or dependence on a trusted third party. In this paper, a blockchain-based authentication scheme for UAV-assisted IoV system (BASUV) is proposed. This solution enables dependable UAV registration and authentication services, and permits the dynamic addition and removal. Specifically, blockchain is introduced to achieve the decentralized management and distributed trust of the UAV certificate ledger. Furthermore, to prevent information tampering and identity deception, we design CMPES, a novel combined scheme based on multiple public key generators (PKGs) for encryption and signature. Identical key pair in encryption and signature can reduce key generation and management overhead.

Resilient Consensus for Discrete-Time Multiagent Systems With a Dynamic Leader and Time Delay: Theory and Experiment,"The ever-present cyber-attacks have posed a significant challenge to consensus of multiagent systems (MASs), due to their capability of compromising agents. These threats underscore the critical need to design control strategies that can endow MASs with resilience. In this article, we address resilient consensus problems for first- and second-order discrete-time MASs, considering the presence of malicious agents, a dynamic leader, and communication delay. First, a resilient controller is designed for first-order MASs, and sufficient conditions are derived based on existing robust graph concepts to achieve consensus with ultimately bounded error. Next, since the derived error bound grows factorially with the system scale, a novel graph structure and a modified controller are proposed to limit the growth to a linear rate. Building upon the obtained results, an estimator-based control framework is introduced to solve resilient consensus problems for second-order MASs. Finally, comparative simulations and practical experiments based on unmanned ground vehicles and unmanned-aerial-vehicles are conducted to validate the effectiveness and practicability of the proposed control methods.  © 2013 IEEE.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85205000956&doi=10.1109%2fTCYB.2024.3464490&partnerID=40&md5=5d81ddc6e48219c937e5b6ca7b792507,IEEE Transactions on Cybernetics,2024
Fast 3-D Radio Map Reconstruction via Cross Tensor Approximation,"3-D radio maps provide significantly richer information than their 2-D counterparts in spectrum cartography. However, reconstruction methods for 3-D radio maps remain underexplored. Classic methods, such as spatial interpolation and matrix completion, can be adapted for 3-D scenarios, but they are often computationally intensive and require a substantial number of sampling measurements. To address these challenges, we propose a novel and efficient 3-D radio map reconstruction paradigm inspired by cross tensor approximation (CTA). During the measurement phase, only piecewise straight-line paths are required, making this method well-suited for the flying trajectories of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs). In the reconstruction phase, we utilize the inherent tensor structure of 3-D radio maps by employing the fiber sampling tensor decomposition (FSTD) algorithm, which ensures high-quality and computationally efficient reconstruction from the measurements. To further reduce the number of measurements, we introduce a new algorithm called interpolation-integrated FSTD (II-FSTD). This algorithm builds on the original FSTD yet exploits the smoothness of radio maps to incorporate interpolation, thereby reducing the required measurement frequency. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that the proposed paradigm can reconstruct 3-D radio maps with high quality, using fewer measurements and less computational time compared to state-of-the-art techniques. Notably, in scenarios with lower measurement frequency, II-FSTD outperforms other methods, achieving superior reconstruction performance.  © 2024 IEEE.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85204396201&doi=10.1109%2fJIOT.2024.3454817&partnerID=40&md5=d1c1b6d72e50d257413114fcd077b99a,IEEE Internet of Things Journal,2024
Imagination-Augmented Hierarchical Reinforcement Learning for Safe and Interactive Autonomous Driving in Urban Environments,"Hierarchical reinforcement learning (HRL) incorporates temporal abstraction into reinforcement learning (RL) by explicitly taking advantage of hierarchical structures. Modern HRL typically designs a hierarchical agent composed of a high-level policy and low-level policies. The high-level policy selects which low-level policy to activate at a lower frequency and the activated low-level policy selects an action at each time step. Recent HRL algorithms have achieved performance gains over standard RL algorithms in synthetic navigation tasks. However, these HRL algorithms still cannot be applied to real-world navigation tasks. One of the main challenges is that real-world navigation tasks require an agent to perform safe and interactive behaviors in dynamic environments. In this paper, we propose imagination-augmented HRL (IAHRL) that efficiently integrates imagination into HRL to enable an agent to learn safe and interactive behaviors in real-world navigation tasks. Imagination is to predict the consequences of actions without interactions with actual environments. The key idea behind IAHRL is that the low-level policies imagine safe and structured behaviors, and then the high-level policy infers interactions with surrounding objects by interpreting the imagined behaviors. We also introduce a new attention mechanism that allows the high-level policy to be permutation-invariant to the order of surrounding objects and to prioritize our agent over them. To evaluate IAHRL, we introduce five complex urban driving tasks, which are among the most challenging real-world navigation tasks. The experimental results indicate that IAHRL enables an agent to perform safe and interactive behaviors, achieving higher success rates and lower average episode steps than baselines. © 2000-2011 IEEE.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85204943863&doi=10.1109%2fTITS.2024.3457776&partnerID=40&md5=a90ea4090790e727ffaa1937d550bece,IEEE Transactions on Intelligent Transportation Systems,2024
Action Robust Reinforcement Learning for Air Mobility Deconfliction Against Conflict Induced Spoofing,"Increased dynamic drone usage has increased complexity in aerial navigation and often demands distributed local deconfliction. Due to the high velocities and few landmarks, robust deconfliction relies on precise positioning and synchronization. However, intentional spoofing attacks aimed at inducing navigation conflicts threaten the reliability of conventional techniques. Here, we address these concerns by establishing a baseline on the impact of novel conflict-inducing spoofing attacks on existing geometric navigation methods. Based on the impact of the attacks on the navigation, reinforcement learning (RL) strategy is used to counter the effects of spoofing attacks. In order to counter the effect of spoofing in randomized dynamic airspace conditions, a zero-sum action-robust (ZSAR) RL based on mixed Nash equilibrium objective is used. The proposed methodology yields an improved number of conflict-free paths while reducing average conflicts compared to existing state of the art RL strategies, thus making it suitable for deploying autonomous aircrafts. © 2000-2011 IEEE.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85205009274&doi=10.1109%2fTITS.2024.3454354&partnerID=40&md5=f7b9894733327ac9f4b8f6d9bc8e8bbb,IEEE Transactions on Intelligent Transportation Systems,2024
Toward Robust 3D Perception for Autonomous Vehicles: A Review of Adversarial Attacks and Countermeasures,"At present the perception system of autonomous vehicles is grounded on 3D vision technologies along with deep learning to process depth information. Although deep learning models for 3D perception give promising results, recent research demonstrates that they are also vulnerable to adversarial attacks similar to deep learning models trained on 2D images. As a result, it is essential to further explore the vulnerabilities of 3D perception models in autonomous vehicles and find methods to cope with the risks associated with these adversarial vulnerabilities, in order to improve the social acceptance of commercial autonomous vehicles. This study aims to provide an in-depth overview of the recent adversarial attacks and countermeasures against 3D perception models on autonomous vehicles. Further, challenges associated with the research domain and future research directions are highlighted to make autonomous vehicles robust against adversarial attacks. © 2000-2011 IEEE.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85204556265&doi=10.1109%2fTITS.2024.3456293&partnerID=40&md5=ae1cc70c773df7906724ef353adbfa95,IEEE Transactions on Intelligent Transportation Systems,2024
SpotAttack: Covering Spots on Surface to Attack LiDAR-Based Autonomous Driving Systems,"LiDAR significantly contributes to autonomous driving systems (ADSs) through its perception, prediction and decision layers. Recent research has focused on implementing adversarial attack on LiDAR-based ADS by generating perturbed point cloud adversarial samples. However, most state-of-the-art attacks focus on stationary scenarios, making it difficult to apply them in dynamic scenarios with multiframe point clouds. In this article, we introduce SpotAttack, a novel adversarial attack that targets specific areas of a vehicle's surface using distributed patches. Unlike traditional adversarial mechanism that mislead the object classification through pixel perturbations, our designed spots decrease the reflectivity of LiDAR rays, causing the point clouds in these patches to be obscured. As a result, the 3-D object detection network will produce incorrect pose estimations based on the adversarial point cloud samples. To ensure the effectiveness of SpotAttack in dynamic scenarios, we establish a position matrix for multiobjective optimization and adopt genetic algorithm (GA) to address the nondifferentiable issue in spots generation. We conduct extensive experiments in three typical scenarios, and the results demonstrate that the proposed attack can manipulate LiDAR perception and influence ADS decision making.  © 2024 IEEE.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85203451677&doi=10.1109%2fJIOT.2024.3452694&partnerID=40&md5=72733fb2eff1d854cacf7b4d756f1a16,IEEE Internet of Things Journal,2024
Towards AutoAI: Optimizing a Machine Learning System with Black-box and Differentiable Components,"Machine learning (ML) models in the real world typically do not exist in isolation. They are usually part of a complex system (e.g., healthcare systems, self-driving cars) containing multiple ML and black-box components. The problem of optimizing such systems, which we refer to as automated AI (AutoAI), requires us to jointly train all ML components together and presents a significant challenge because the number of system parameters is extremely high and the system has no analytical form. To circumvent this, we introduce a novel algorithm called A-BAD-BO which uses each ML component's local loss as an auxiliary indicator for system performance. A-BAD-BO uses Bayesian optimization (BO) to optimize the local loss configuration of a system in a smaller dimensional space and exploits the differentiable structure of ML components to recover optimal system parameters from the optimized configuration. We show A-BAD-BO converges to optimal system parameters by showing that it is asymptotically no regret. We use A-BAD-BO to optimize several synthetic and real-world complex systems, including a prompt engineering pipeline for large language models containing millions of system parameters. Our results demonstrate that A-BAD-BO yields better system optimality than gradient-driven baselines and is more sample-efficient than pure BO algorithms.

Competition-Awareness Partial Task Offloading and UAV Deployment for Multitier Parallel Computational Internet of Vehicles,"Vehicular edge computing is poised to meet the requirements of emerging applications in Internet of Vehicles (IoV) by offloading computation tasks from resource-limited vehicles to edge. However, the space-time-dynamic offloading demands of vehicle users (VUs) can hardly be satisfied only by road side units (RSUs) due to their fixed resource deployment and incomplete coverage. To this end, in this article, we design a multitier IoV system, where RSU, parked cars, and unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) serve as edge platforms to offer computing services. To fully utilize the multitier resources, the tasks generated by VUs can be split into multiple parts and executed in parallel on local processors as well as edge servers. Under this arrangement, we formulate a joint UAV deployment and partial task offloading problem to minimize the system cost, which includes processing delay, energy consumption, and rental price. We then develop a heuristic UAV deployment method to optimize the coverage of multitier network. Moreover, a distributed task offloading approach based on multiagent deep reinforcement learning is proposed to achieve cooperative decision makings and load balancing, thereby overcoming the adversarial competition among VUs. Experimental evaluations reveal that compared to state-of-the-art schemes that rely on a centralized controller, the proposed approach achieves superior performance with higher implementation efficiency while avoiding extra information exchange overhead. © 2007-2012 IEEE.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85203878403&doi=10.1109%2fJSYST.2024.3439746&partnerID=40&md5=359ab4cf82fb82cfadfbf61246449b50,IEEE Systems Journal,2024
Sum-Rate Maximization for D2D-Enabled UAV Networks With Seamless Coverage Constraint,"This article investigates sum-rate maximization while achieving seamless coverage with the minimum number of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) in a device-to-device (D2D)-enabled UAV network. Toward this end, we formulate it as a nonlinear and nonconvex optimization problem, and then propose a max-rate-min-number (MRMN) scheme to solve this optimization problem. First, we derive UAV's coverage radius which can depict the maximum coverage for user equipments, and then implement the optimal deployment for UAV swarm by exploiting the disk covering theory. Furthermore, we apply the coalitional game theory to design the cooperative strategy between UAV swarm and ground equipments. Finally, a coalition formation algorithm is presented for achieving maximum system sum-rate while reducing the number of UAVs under seamless coverage constraint. Extensive simulation results are provided to validate the effectiveness of our proposed MRMN scheme, and also illustrate that the scheme can improve the system sum-rate and reduce the number of deployed UAVs. Meanwhile, we further conduct a performance comparison between our scheme and the existing benchmark schemes.  © 2014 IEEE.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85203642491&doi=10.1109%2fJIOT.2024.3454365&partnerID=40&md5=53ac53958aead9bf2a60917f1d8fdac5,IEEE Internet of Things Journal,2024
Hacking Predictors Means Hacking Cars: Using Sensitivity Analysis to Identify Trajectory Prediction Vulnerabilities for Autonomous Driving Security,"Adversarial attacks on learning-based multi-modal trajectory predictors have already been demonstrated. However, there are still open questions about the effects of perturbations on inputs other than state histories, and how these attacks impact downstream planning and control. In this paper, we conduct a sensitivity analysis on two trajectory prediction models, Trajectron++ and AgentFormer. The analysis reveals that between all inputs, almost all of the perturbation sensitivities for both models lie only within the most recent position and velocity states. We additionally demonstrate that, despite dominant sensitivity on state history perturbations, an undetectable image map perturbation made with the Fast Gradient Sign Method can induce large prediction error increases in both models, revealing that these trajectory predictors are, in fact, susceptible to image-based attacks. Using an optimization-based planner and example perturbations crafted from sensitivity results, we show how these attacks can cause a vehicle to come to a sudden stop from moderate driving speeds. © 2024 M.

Linear Stability of Heterogeneous Traffic Flow Incorporating V2X Communication and Intraplatoon Spatial Distribution,"This article provides a comprehensive analysis of the effects of connected and automated vehicles (CAVs) market penetration rate, spatial distribution, and V2X communication on the stability of heterogeneous traffic flow. We explore stability variations across different scenarios by developing a car-following model and analyzing stability conditions. Our findings show that increasing CAV market penetration enhances traffic flow stability by expanding the stable speed range and reducing the unstable speed range. Additionally, we investigate the influence of CAV spatial distribution and V2X communication on traffic flow stability. The results reveal that forming CAV platoons reduces intervehicle interference, thus improving stability. Furthermore, V2X communication enhances traffic flow stability by enabling more accurate prediction and control of car-following behaviors. We also examine the impact of cyberattacks on heterogeneous traffic flow, finding that such attacks cause unnecessary accelerations, decelerations, and delays, thereby increasing accident risks. Finally, we acknowledge the study's limitations and propose future research directions, including nonlinear stability analysis of heterogeneous traffic flow and developing effective control strategies to mitigate the adverse effects of cyberattacks.  © 2014 IEEE.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85204152101&doi=10.1109%2fJIOT.2024.3456841&partnerID=40&md5=f2224c8598a05d9829f4bd67fe4bec7e,IEEE Internet of Things Journal,2024
A Roadmap to the Integration between Systems Engineering and Circular Design to Develop Sustainable Industrial Product,"The achievement of sustainable development goals requires implementing a design approach to the industrial product development aimed to reduce waste, and to increase value, in accordance to principles of the 'circular economy.' To mitigate the product obsolescence rate, the design activity aims at making the product multifunctional, its life longer and its maintainability more effective. Moreover, the product must be easily reparable, adaptable to operating conditions, friendly updatable, and reusable after decommissioning. Those targets affect the design methodology, and require some suitable tools. This article investigates how the 'model-based systems engineering' is applied to the 'circular design,' to provide a sustainable product life, and to regenerate the system, while decommissioning. Particularly, the direct experience of machine designer of industrial product, being the result of material processing and manufacturing, is considered. Are matter of discussion the identification of some issues related to sustainability and decommissioning, the methodologic tools useful to integrate the two approaches, the impact on the metamodeling activity, and the interoperable tool chain exploited.

Verification of Neural Reachable Tubes via Scenario Optimization and Conformal Prediction,"Learning-based approaches for controlling safety-critical autonomous systems are rapidly growing in popularity; thus, it is important to provide rigorous and robust assurances on their performance and safety. Hamilton-Jacobi (HJ) reachability analysis is a popular formal verification tool for providing such guarantees, since it can handle general nonlinear system dynamics, bounded adversarial system disturbances, and state and input constraints. However, it involves solving a Partial Differential Equation (PDE), whose computational and memory complexity scales exponentially with respect to the state dimension, making its direct use on large-scale systems intractable. To overcome this challenge, neural approaches, such as DeepReach, have been used to synthesize reachable tubes and safety controllers for high-dimensional systems. However, verifying these neural reachable tubes remains challenging. In this work, we propose two different verification methods, based on robust scenario optimization and conformal prediction, to provide probabilistic safety guarantees for neural reachable tubes. Our methods allow a direct trade-off between resilience to outlier errors in the neural tube, which are inevitable in a learning-based approach, and the strength of the probabilistic safety guarantee. Furthermore, we show that split conformal prediction, a widely used method in the machine learning community for uncertainty quantification, reduces to a scenario-based approach, making the two methods equivalent not only for verification of neural reachable tubes but also more generally. To our knowledge, our proof is the first in the literature to show a strong relationship between the highly related but disparate fields of conformal prediction and scenario optimization. Finally, we propose an outlier-adjusted verification approach that harnesses information about the error distribution in neural reachable tubes to recover greater safe volumes. We demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed approaches for the high-dimensional problems of multi-vehicle collision avoidance and rocket landing with no-go zones. © 2024 A. Lin & S.

RIS-Empowered Topology Control for Decentralized Federated Learning in Urban Air Mobility,"Urban air mobility (UAM) expands vehicles from the ground to the near-ground space, envisioned as a revolution for transportation systems. Comprehensive scene perception is the foundation for autonomous aerial driving. However, UAM encounters the intelligent perception challenge: high-perception learning requirements conflict with the limited sensors and computing chips of flying cars. To overcome the challenge, federated learning (FL) and other collaborative learning have been proposed. It enables resource-limited devices to conduct onboard deep learning (DL) collaboratively. But traditional FL relies on a central integrator for DL model aggregation, which is difficult to deploy in dynamic UAM environments. The fully decentralized learning schemes may be the intuitive solution while the convergence of decentralized learning cannot be guaranteed. Accordingly, this article explores reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (RISs)-empowered decentralized FL (DFL), taking account of topological attributes to facilitate the DFL performance with convergence guarantee. Several DFL topological criteria are proposed for optimizing the transmission delay and convergence rate. Subsequently, we innovatively leverage the RIS link construction and deconstruction ability to remold the current network based on the proposed topological criteria. This article rethinks the functions of RIS from the perspective of the network layer. Furthermore, a deep deterministic policy gradient-based RIS phase shift control algorithm is developed to reshape the communication network. Simulation experiments are conducted over MobileNet-based multiview learning to verify the efficiency of the DFL framework.  © 2014 IEEE.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85203554363&doi=10.1109%2fJIOT.2024.3453964&partnerID=40&md5=5cd2371377b9054077d8b5dd9b2e8b38,IEEE Internet of Things Journal,2024
Balanced Reward-inspired Reinforcement Learning for Autonomous Vehicle Racing,"Autonomous vehicle racing has attracted extensive interest due to its great potential in autonomous driving at the extreme limits. Model-based and learning-based methods are being widely used in autonomous racing. However, model-based methods cannot cope with the dynamic environments when only local perception is available. As a comparison, learning-based methods can handle complex environments under local perception. Recently, deep reinforcement learning (DRL) has gained popularity in autonomous racing. DRL outperforms conventional learning-based methods by handling complex situations and leveraging local information. DRL algorithms, such as the proximal policy algorithm, can achieve a good balance between the execution time and safety in autonomous vehicle competition. However, the training outcomes of conventional DRL methods exhibit inconsistent correctness in decision-making. The instability in decision-making introduces safety concerns in autonomous vehicle racing, such as collisions into track boundaries. The proposed algorithm is capable to avoid collisions and improve the training quality. Simulation results on a physical engine demonstrate that the proposed algorithm outperforms other DRL algorithms in in collision avoidance, achieving safer control during sharp bends, and higher training quality among multiple tracks. © 2024 Z.

UAV Dynamic Service Function Chains Deployment Based on Security Considerations: A Reinforcement Learning Method,"The efficient and secure management of resources within flying ad-hoc networks (FANETs) poses formidable challenges. FANETs constitute a pivotal element of the space-air-ground-integrated network (SAGIN), employing network virtualization (NV) technology in tandem with service function chain (SFC) to facilitate end-to-end network services, akin to terrestrial networks. Nonetheless, the transient, dynamic nature of FANETs coupled with their susceptibility to network attacks engenders considerable complexity in the placement of SFCs within these networks. To address the rationality and security of resource allocation for SFC placement, this article proposes a reinforcement learning algorithm that sets strict security-level restrictions on the placement process and fully extracts the key features in FANETs. Additionally, a multilayer policy network is devised to dynamically perceive alterations in the FANET environment and compute an optimal SFC placement strategy. The proposed algorithm exhibits real-time adaptability to the dynamic environment, quantifies influential factors during placement, and achieves dynamic SFC placement. To assess the efficacy of the algorithm, three evaluation metrics - namely, SFC placement success rate, long-term average revenue, and long-term revenue cost ratio - are formulated and extensively evaluated through a plethora of experiments. Comparative analysis against alternative algorithms demonstrates enhancements of 20.6%, 15.3%, and 12.1% in the aforementioned metrics, respectively.

L2-Gain-Based Path Following Control for Autonomous Vehicles Under Time-Constrained DoS Attacks,"Autonomous vehicles (AVs) are being enhanced by introducing wireless communication to improve their intelligence, reliability and efficiency. Despite all of these distinct advantages, the open wireless communication links and connectivity make the AVs' vulnerability to cyber-attacks. This paper proposes an L2 -gain-based resilient path following control strategy for AVs under time-constrained denial-of-service (DoS) attacks and external interference. A switching-like path following control model of AVs is first built in the presence of DoS attacks, which is characterized by the lower and upper bounds of the sleeping period and active period of the DoS attacker. Then, the exponential stability and L2 -gain performance of the resulting switched system are analyzed by using a time-varying Lyapunov function method. On the basis of the obtained analysis results, L2 -gain-based resilient controllers are designed to achieve an acceptable path-following performance despite the presence of such DoS attacks. Finally, the effectiveness of the proposed L2 -gain-based resilient path following control method is confirmed by the simulation results obtained for the considered AVs model with different DoS attack parameters.  © 2024 IEEE.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85203104339&doi=10.1109%2fTITS.2024.3422028&partnerID=40&md5=3b466b967290d25455bac05e5a87f339,IEEE Transactions on Intelligent Transportation Systems,2024
Kite-Inspired Deadlock-Free Deploying for UAV Swarm-to-Swarm in GNSS-Denied Environment,"In a global navigation satellite system (GNSS) denied environment, unmanned-aerial-vehicle (UAV) clusters and adversarial targets do not have precise positional information. In contrast, targets keep high mobility and try to hide from surveillance. These accumulated complex scenarios can cause difficulty in tracking, monitoring, and attacking (or rescuing) target swarms. To solve these problems, we organize the self-organizing UAV clusters to involve topology construction, routing, communication deployment, and collaborative control. We aim to reduce reliance on control bases and achieve coordinated completion of relevant tasks. We propose a series of task scheduling and UAV deployment strategies to address the dynamic changes of obscured target positions in real scenarios. Meanwhile, to confront poorly understood target swarms, we introduce an UAV network connectivity structure like a kite, which only fixes a single node - ""the control base.""Based on the distance between control bases and targets, we propose two modified classical evolution algorithms to search for the optimal solution set to expand the kite-like topology step by step. At the same time, a depth-first search-based unlocking algorithm is designed to unlock the target matrix that satisfies the UAV model constraints while considering a new deadlock scenario of multitarget saturation task scheduling. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed comprehensive multitask scheduling algorithm exhibits good convergence and provides high-efficiency online and offline solutions for deployment.  © 2014 IEEE.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85202751275&doi=10.1109%2fJIOT.2024.3449634&partnerID=40&md5=65ead37767b769aba16bb70438ae7472,IEEE Internet of Things Journal,2024
Human-Assisted Resilient Coordination for Automated Platoon With False Data Injection Attack,"This paper investigates the resilient platooning problem of connected and automated vehicles (CAVs) under false-data injection (FDI) attacks. These attacks can alter the system state of any vehicle within a platoon at any time, presenting a significant challenge. To tackle this, we introduce a human-assisted resilient coordination (HARC) approach for CAVs, comprised of three core modules: a joint attack detection mechanism, a human-assisted coordination scheme, and a distributed optimization-based control module. The attack detection approach monitors vehicles at two distinct levels - local communication and global communication. Our human-assisted coordination strategy is designed not only to respond efficiently to attacks but also to ensure seamless coordination of the vehicle platoon, thereby preventing accidents and enhancing flexibility. By incorporating human input, we bolster the resilience and security of platoon coordination. Moreover, we present a distributed optimization-based control technique tailored specifically for constrained CAVs. A resilience constraint is designed and incorporated into the optimization problem, thereby empowering CAVs to identify adversarial communication channels via a localized communication detector. We provide experimental results to showcase the effectiveness of our proposed approach and to highlight its implications for resilient platooning under FDI attacks.  © 1967-2012 IEEE.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85202760976&doi=10.1109%2fTVT.2024.3439569&partnerID=40&md5=358b84d2f87229cafa20526f09587092,IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology,2024
P-MapNet: Far-Seeing Map Generator Enhanced by Both SDMap and HDMap Priors,"Autonomous vehicles are gradually entering city roads today, with the help of high-definition maps (HDMaps). However, the reliance on HDMaps prevents autonomous vehicles from stepping into regions without this expensive digital infrastructure. This fact drives many researchers to study online HDMap generation algorithms, but the performance of these algorithms at far regions is still unsatisfying. We present P-MapNet, in which the letter P highlights the fact that we focus on incorporating map priors to improve model performance. Specifically, we exploit priors in both standard-definition map (SDMap) and HDMap. On one hand, we extract weakly aligned SDMap from OpenStreetMap and encode it as an additional conditioning branch. Despite the misalignment challenge, our attention-based architecture adaptively attends to relevant SDMap skeletons and significantly improves performance.

Ethical Alignment Decision Making for Connected Autonomous Vehicle in Traffic Dilemmas via Reinforcement Learning From Human Feedback,"Since the introduction of the trolley problem, the ethical decision-making conundrum has evolved from autonomous vehicles (AVs) to connected AVs (CAVs), continuing as a prominent challenge. When confronted with ethical dilemmas, CAVs must align their responses not merely with value-neutral human preferences but also with broader moral and ethical frameworks. Consequently, to ensure that CAVs do not engage in actions that contravene established human moral principles, it is imperative that the ethical considerations are meticulously integrated into their decision-making systems. In this article, we introduce an innovative multiscale multimodal ethical network (M2ENet), which aims to align the AV decision-making system with human ethical feedback in ethical dilemma scenarios. First, we extract morphological and dynamic features from sensory information and signal data, respectively, using multiscale multimodal representation. Additionally, ethical policy-based network is devised to enable AVs to comprehend ethical information, which includes the introduction of an ethical alignment factor to ethically align the feature matrix from human feedback. Furthermore, the accuracy of ethical interaction information is improved through coupled ethical module informed by human feedback. Finally, the efficacy of the system is demonstrated through three representative ethical dilemmas in traffic scenarios, employing both simulation experiments and hardware-in-the-loop testing. The simulation experiments reveal that our proposed model can generate decision-making strategies more aligned with human preferences in ethical traffic scenarios. In addition, in our hardware-in-the-loop tests, it is observed that the average percentage of ethical bias weights decreases by 45.06% after 150 episodes of training.  © 2014 IEEE.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85201776116&doi=10.1109%2fJIOT.2024.3447070&partnerID=40&md5=dac8c0b3197d665c366a57159005ed5f,IEEE Internet of Things Journal,2024
Exploiting Radio Frequency Characteristics With a Support Unmanned Aerial Vehicle to Improve Wireless Sensor Location Estimation Accuracy,"A lot of the devices in the Internet of Things are sensors responsible for capturing environmental information and relaying it to a system or network. Oftentimes, it is important to know the location of these sensors to better contextualize the information received from them. However, the sensors are purposely simple and cheap, meaning that conventional localization techniques, such as global navigation satellite systems are not feasible. Research has been done on using unmanned aerial vehicles to estimate the location of the sensors, but issues with signal strength fluctuation and location approximation because of it are still prevalent. In this work, we propose a new method for estimating the location of sensors by exploiting the characteristics of radio wave signal propagation and creating a new flight path design, a solution to minimize the impact of variation in measurements, a novel candidate point generation through signal strength analysis, and a method to find the location based on the candidates. Through a thought-out experiment, we show that the proposed algorithm is overall significantly better than the existing solution when it comes to identifying the location of outdoor sensors. © 2014 IEEE.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85201759238&doi=10.1109%2fJIOT.2024.3448394&partnerID=40&md5=5d717b4f22e534aa166aac5792e300e6,IEEE Internet of Things Journal,2024
Malicious Data Traceability and Throughput Optimization Using Blockchain (IOTA Smart Contracts) for Next Generation Internet of Vehicles,"The Internet of Vehicles (IoV) faces security threats from malicious entities that endanger vehicles. However, traditional centralized networks have limitations in scalability, latency, and security. Decentralized blockchain architectures provide an alternative, though conventional blockchains also have restrictions. We develop an architecture based on IOTA's Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) ledger tailored to IoV needs to enhance traceability, throughput, and security. The goal is to leverage IOTA's decentralized, high throughput, low latency design to overcome limitations in existing IoV networks. We propose an IOTA-based model using smart contracts for malicious data/user tracing and timing side-channels for attack detection. We adaptively schedule data to optimize throughput based on traffic conditions. Our simulations compare throughput, latency, and attack detection across varied scenarios. Our results demonstrate that the architecture enables automated security via decentralized consensus, avoiding centralized failures. The smart contracts facilitate real-time threat tracing and mitigation. Timing analysis reveals IOTA's ability to identify attacks through latency fluctuations. Optimized data transfer scheduling adapts to congestion levels. Overall, integrating reputation systems, smart contracts, and IOTA's innovations significantly improves security, efficiency, and scalability compared to centralized and blockchain IoV networks. This work advances IoV security by outlining a comprehensive blockchain solution leveraging IOTA's unique capabilities. The decentralized mechanisms enhance traceability and trust while optimizing performance tailored to vehicular demands.

Symmetry-Augmented Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning for Scalable UAV Trajectory Design and User Scheduling,"Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) as mobile base stations are recognized as effective means for emergency communications. The performance of such systems depends on the movement of UAVs and scheduling of ground users (GUs). However, devising an efficient algorithm to jointly optimize UAV trajectories and user scheduling is still challenging, especially in real-time scenarios lacking central controllers. Multi-agent deep reinforcement learning (MADRL) provides a promising solution to this problem. Nevertheless, as the numbers of UAVs and GUs increase, existing MADRL algorithms encounter scalability and sample efficiency issues. In this paper, we develop a novel symmetry-augmented MADRL approach for learning scalable UAV trajectory design and user scheduling policies. The core idea is to utilize symmetries to reduce the multi-agent state-action space and enhance sample efficiency. Specifically, we design a family of neural networks to learn individual policies, namely entity permutation equivariant policy networks (EP2Nets). EP2Nets effectively leverage the permutation symmetry to reduce redundancy in the state-action space. Additionally, we achieve data augmentation by exploiting rotational and reflection symmetries, further boosting sample efficiency. Finally, a Symmetric QMIX (SymmQMIX) algorithm is proposed by integrating the EP2Net and data augmentation method into the QMIX algorithm. Simulation results indicate that SymmQMIX significantly outperforms QMIX and other symmetry-enhanced algorithms, achieving a 4.5-fold increase in converged performance and a 100-fold improvement in sample efficiency. © 2002-2012 IEEE.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85200825813&doi=10.1109%2fTMC.2024.3437679&partnerID=40&md5=204d797daf05ea18726f38f0e48ba59f,IEEE Transactions on Mobile Computing,2024
Secure Offloading With Adversarial Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning Against Intelligent Eavesdroppers in UAV-Enabled Mobile Edge Computing,"Mobile edge computing (MEC) has attracted widespread attention due to its ability to effectively alleviate the cloud computing load and significantly reduce latency. However, the potential eavesdroppers challenge the security of the MEC systems and the rapid development of artificial intelligence (AI) has made this security situation more severe. In most existing studies, the eavesdroppers are non-intelligent and it is assumed that they are fixed or move in a simple manner. Obviously, there is a gap from such an assumption to the real conditions that the eavesdropping unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) may adjust their flight paths intelligently. To better reflect real-world scenarios, we consider a multi-UAV-assisted MEC system in the presence of intelligent eavesdroppers and propose an adversarial multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL)-based scheme for secure computational offloading and resource allocation. With this scheme, we aim to solve the zero-sum game between the legitimate UAVs and the eavesdropping UAVs, in which the two types of UAVs take turns acting as the agents of MARL to alternately optimize their respective opposing objectives. The simulation experimental results indicate that the proposed scheme significantly outperforms the existing baseline methods in dealing with the intelligent eavesdropping UAVs, and ensures high energy efficiency of Internet of Things (IoT) devices even in the worst-case scenario when dealing with potential eavesdropping threats.  © 2002-2012 IEEE.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85200803693&doi=10.1109%2fTMC.2024.3439016&partnerID=40&md5=074c3f9461992b1d9b7d75a16726e71b,IEEE Transactions on Mobile Computing,2024
Joint Computation Offloading and Multidimensional Resource Allocation in Air-Ground Integrated Vehicular Edge Computing Network,"The integration of vehicle edge computing (VEC) and air-ground integrated network is considered as a key technology to achieve autonomous driving. It exploits the ubiquitous service coverage and enables tasks to be offloaded to various components, such as high-altitude platform (HAP), unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV), and roadside unit (RSU). In this article, we address the challenge of minimizing the overall task offloading delay in the air-ground integrated VEC network through a joint multicomputation equipment selection and multidimensional resource allocation (JCESRA) problem. Considering the nonconvexity inherent in the problem, we employ the fundamental idea of the block coordinate descent (BCD) method to tackle it. Initially, we exclude the HAP and decompose the primal problem into three subproblems: 1) low-altitude computation equipment selection; 2) joint bandwidth and computation resource allocation; and 3) UAV trajectory design. The first subproblem, which involves integer programming, is solved by using the many-to-one matching method. Meanwhile, we utilize the CVX and successive convex approximation (SCA) method to solve the last two subproblems, respectively. Considering the matching externality, we utilize the coalition game method to deal with it. Based on the solutions of the three subproblems, the JCESRA algorithm without considering the HAP has been proposed. Subsequently, we consider the HAP into the problem. Because the task offloading decision and computation resource allocation of the HAP problem can be viewed as a knapsack problem, we utilize the dynamic programming method to solve it. Because some tasks are offloaded to the HAP, there are some redundant computation resources in UAVs and RSU. We reallocate the computation resources of UAVs and RSU to further reduce the task offloading delay. At last, we present the complete JCESRA algorithm. The simulation results unequivocally indicate that the proposed JCESRA algorithm outperforms other algorithms by significantly reducing the task offloading delay. 2024 IEEE.

A Secure Object Detection Technique for Intelligent Transportation Systems,"Federated Learning is a decentralized machine learning technique that creates a global model by aggregating local models from multiple edge devices without a need to access the local data. However, due to the distributed nature of federated learning, there is a larger attack surface, making cyber-attack detection and defense challenging. Although prior works developed various defense strategies to address security issues in federated learning settings, most approaches fail to mitigate cyber-attacks due to the diverse characteristics of the attack, edge devices, and data distribution. To address this issue, this paper develops a hybrid privacy-preserving algorithm to safeguard federated learning methods against malicious attacks in Intelligent Transportation Systems, considering object detection as a downstream machine learning task. This algorithm involves the edge devices (e.g., autonomous vehicles) and road side units to collaboratively train their model while maintaining the privacy of their respective data. Furthermore, this hybrid algorithm provides robust security against data poisoning-based model replacement and inference attacks throughout the training phase. We evaluated our model using the CIFAR10 and LISA traffic light dataset, demonstrating its ability to mitigate malicious attacks with minimal impact on the performance of main tasks.  © 2020 IEEE.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85200808064&doi=10.1109%2fOJITS.2024.3440876&partnerID=40&md5=c837fcdd7968cd8d3d1778c16df48d73,IEEE Open Journal of Intelligent Transportation Systems,2024
Decentralized Coordination for Multi-Agent Data Collection in Dynamic Environments,"Coordinated multi-robot systems are an effective way to harvest data from sensor networks and implement active perception strategies. However, achieving efficient coordination in a way that guarantees a target QoS while adapting dynamically to changes (in the environment and/or in the system) is a key open issue. In this paper, we propose a novel decentralized Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) algorithm for dynamic environments that allows agents to optimize their own actions while achieving some form of coordination. Its main underlying idea is to balance adaptively the exploration-exploitation trade-off to deal effectively with changes in the environment while filtering out outdated and irrelevant samples via a sliding window mechanism. We show both theoretically and through simulations that in dynamic environments our algorithm provides a log-factor (in terms of time steps) smaller regret than state-of-the-art decentralized multi-agent planning methods. We instantiate our approach to the problem of underwater data collection, showing in a variety of different settings that our approach greatly outperforms the best-competing approaches, both in terms of convergence speed and global utility.  © 2002-2012 IEEE.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85200260078&doi=10.1109%2fTMC.2024.3437360&partnerID=40&md5=572cfa51b03032a583b0a9e2e583fe37,IEEE Transactions on Mobile Computing,2024
BAKAS-UAV: A Secure Blockchain-Assisted Authentication and Key Agreement Scheme for Unmanned Aerial Vehicles Networks,"Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs, also known as Drones) have been widely employed in military defense and civilian service. However, as UAVs communicate over insecure open wireless channels, the security challenges and privacy concerns are becoming increasingly prominent. Moreover, some existing schemes to achieve authentication and key agreement (AKA) among UAVs are spliced with the assistance of two UAV-2-GCS mechanisms, which are not flexible enough to be applied in the Internet of Drones (IoD) scenarios. This article proposes a blockchain-assisted AKA scheme for UAVs networks (BAKAS-UAV) referred to as BAKAS-UAV, which addresses security and privacy concerns and overcomes high computational and communication costs in the IoD. A blockchain-based network model is presented in which the ground station acts as an edge node and manages the blockchain, which assists AKA. Based on the network model, both types of AKA mechanisms, UAV-2-GCS and UAV-2-UAV, are proposed, respectively. In particular, the ground control station (GCS) does not participate in the AKA of UAV-2-UAV process; only upon the process is completed the two UAVs synchronize the updated information with GCS. We also implement a smart contract as the authentication service, and the experimental implementation demonstrates the availability of our scheme in IoD. Physical unclonable functions (PUFs) is introduced on the UAVs side to defend against physical capture attacks and also to implement AKA mechanisms. The semantic security is proved formally based on the real-or-random (ROR) model, and the informal analysis shows that the scheme satisfies the demanded security requirements. The scheme's performance is evaluated by simulating the UAVs and GCS settings with Raspberry Pi 4B and MacOS platforms, respectively, with implementation of several cryptographic primitives. The experimental results show that BAKAS-UAV achieves high efficiency. © 2014 IEEE.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85200236436&doi=10.1109%2fJIOT.2024.3431879&partnerID=40&md5=ac13e054d104d69e64c18b0c91aba4d9,IEEE Internet of Things Journal,2024
ByCAN: Reverse Engineering Controller Area Network (CAN) Messages From Bit to Byte Level,"As the primary standard protocol for modern cars, the controller area network (CAN) is a critical research target for automotive cybersecurity threats and autonomous applications. As the decoding specification of CAN is a proprietary black-box maintained by original equipment manufacturers (OEMs), conducting related research and industry developments can be challenging without a comprehensive understanding of the meaning of CAN messages. In this article, we propose a fully automated reverse-engineering system, named ByCAN, to reverse engineer CAN messages. ByCAN outperforms the existing research by introducing byte-level clusters and integrating multiple features at both the byte and bit levels. ByCAN employs the clustering and template matching algorithms to automatically decode the specifications of CAN frames without the need for prior knowledge. Experimental results demonstrate that ByCAN achieves high accuracy in slicing and labeling performance, i.e., the identification of CAN signal boundaries and labels. In the experiments, ByCAN achieves slicing accuracy of 80.21%, slicing coverage of 95.21%, and labeling accuracy of 68.72% for the general labels when analysing the real-world CAN frames.  © 2024 IEEE.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85200245334&doi=10.1109%2fJIOT.2024.3435833&partnerID=40&md5=7306a811afa4345359c31babe30664a7,IEEE Internet of Things Journal,2024
Deep Reinforcement Learning-Based Resource Management for UAV-Assisted Mobile Edge Computing Against Jamming,"In mobile edge computing (MEC) systems, multiple unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) can be utilized as aerial servers to provide computing, communication, and storage services for edge users, called UAV-assisted MEC, which has emerged as a promising technology to improve both the computing and communication performances. Unlike existing works without considering jamming attacks, we investigate a multi-UAV-assisted-MEC scenario under multiple malicious jammers and then propose a resource management approach with the objective of minimizing both the system energy consumption and latency. Due to the time-varying nature of communication environments, we design a multi-agent deep reinforcement learning (MADRL)-based resource management approach to dynamically adjust the CPU frequency, communication bandwidth, and channel access selection of UAVs to enhance the system performance against jamming attacks. On this basis, in order to enhance the algorithm learning efficiency, we propose a multi-agent twin-delayed deep deterministic policy algorithm in combination with the prioritized experience replay mechanism (PER-MATD3) to effectively search for the joint resource management strategy under high-dimensional state and action spaces, where the time-varying channel state information and imperfect attack behavior information are also effectively trained to improve the learning capacity and convergence speed. Simulation and experimental results verify that the proposed approach can significantly decrease the overall system latency (i.e., computing and communication latency) and energy consumption compared to other benchmark algorithms under different real-world settings.  © 2002-2012 IEEE.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85200241000&doi=10.1109%2fTMC.2024.3432491&partnerID=40&md5=3771d3cf224d7e470e923f5cc810228a,IEEE Transactions on Mobile Computing,2024
Group Authentication and Key Establishment Scheme,"Group authentication is a technique that verifies the group membership of multiple users and establishes a shared secret key among them. Unlike the conventional authentication schemes that rely on a central authority to authenticate each user individually, group authentication can perform the authentication process simultaneously for all the members who participate. Group authentication has been found to be a suitable candidate for various applications in crowded in Internet of Things (IoT) environments, such as swarms of drones for agriculture, military, and surveillance, where a group of devices need to establish a secure authenticated communication channel among themselves. The recently presented group authentication algorithms mainly exploit Lagrange polynomial interpolation along with elliptic curve groups over finite fields. A polynomial interpolation-based group authentication scheme (GAS) has a vulnerability that allows malicious interruption by any single entity in the process. Moreover, this scheme requires each entity to obtain the tokens of all other entities, which is impractical in a large-scale setting. The cost of authentication and key establishment also depends on the number of users, creating a scalability issue. As a fresh approach to eliminate these issues, this work suggests the use of inner product spaces for group authentication and key establishment. The approach with linear spaces introduces a reduced computation and communication load to establish a common shared key among the group members. In addition to providing lightweight authentication and key agreement, this approach allows any user in a group to make a nonmember a member, which is expected to be useful for autonomous systems in the future. The scheme is designed in a way that the sponsors of such members can easily be recognized by anyone in the group. Unlike the other GASs based on Lagrange's polynomial interpolation, the proposed scheme does not provide a tool for adversaries to compromise the whole group's secrets by using only a few members' shares as well as it allows to recognize a nonmember easily, which prevents the denial-of-service attacks from which the former group authentication algorithms suffer.  © 2024 IEEE.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85200264075&doi=10.1109%2fJIOT.2024.3436652&partnerID=40&md5=5dbb98ba5077bb42731c333e4af1f070,IEEE Internet of Things Journal,2024
Wi-Fi-Based Real-Time UAV Localization: A Comparative Analysis Between RSSI-Based and FTM-Based Approaches,"Wi-Fi connectivity for localization purposes has been used for several years in the Internet of Things (IoT) context, where the (general) static nature of IoT devices allows to approximately localize them in known environments with low effort and implementation costs. While the accuracy of Wi-Fi localization for IoT applications can be considered as acceptable, the adoption of Wi-Fi-based localization for (a highly mobile) unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) has received limited attention. In this article, a low-cost and low-complexity system architecture is proposed and exploited to perform a comparative analysis between two Wi-Fi-based localization approaches: the traditional received signal strength indicator (RSSI) ranging and the more recent fine time measurement (FTM), based on the IEEE 802.11mc amendment. Our goal is to estimate and compare the efficacy of the proposed system for real-time positioning of a static or moving UAV, evaluating the impact of different filtering solutions on the localization accuracy. The obtained results show that FTM-based localization is more accurate, reducing the positioning error by 37% with respect to the RSSI-based positioning approach.

Adaptive Policy Learning for Connected Autonomous Vehicles Defending Malicious Access Requests by Graph Reinforcement Learning,"Access requests are used in cooperative tasks among connected and automated vehicles (CAVs). Authorization decisions are determined by dynamic trust values in trust value-based access control (TBAC). Manual policy management in TBAC faces challenges when dealing with massive amounts of access data and dynamic environments. Traditional machine learning methods fail to adequately represent the complex spatio-temporal, decentralized and independent access requests. Policy learning for connected autonomous vehicles by graph reinforcement learning (VPolicy-GRL) is proposed, enhancing the conventional deep Q network (DQN) with a graph neural network (GNN) framework. First, a novel three-layer framework of TBAC for CAVs is proposed. Second, trust relations among CAVs are represented as several spatio-temporal dynamic graphs, enabling context-aware authorization decisions. Malicious access requests are categorized into unauthorized access requests caused by Sybil attacks and interfering access requests caused by DoS attacks. Third, the DQN model for VPolicy-GRL is designed. Results demonstrate that VPolicy-GRL achieves superior feature abstraction with STGCN compared to graph convolutional network, which also obtains higher true rejection rates than Double DQN and DQN for both unauthorized and interfering access requests.

Deep Learning Security Breach by Evolutionary Universal Perturbation Attack (EUPA),"The potential for sabotaging deep convolutions neural networks classifiers by universal perturbation attack (UPA) has proved itself as an effective threat to fool deep learning models in sensitive applications such as autonomous vehicles, clinical diagnosis, face recognition, and so on. The prospective application of UPA is for adversarial training of deep convolutional networks against the attacks. Although evolutionary algorithms have already shown their tremendous ability in solving nonconvex complex problems, the literature has limited exploration of evolutionary techniques and strategies for UPA, thus, it needs to be explored on evolutionary algorithms to minimize the magnitude and number of perturbation pixels while maximizing the misclassification of maximum data samples. In this research. This work focuses on utilizing an integer coded genetic algorithm within an evolutionary framework to evolve the UPA. The evolutionary UPA has been structured, analyzed, and compared for two evolutionary optimization structures: 1) constrained single-objective evolutionary UPA; and 2) Pareto double-objective evolutionary UPA. The efficiency of the methodology is analyzed on GoogleNet convolution neural network for its effectiveness on the Imagenet dataset. The results show that under the same experimental conditions, the constrained single objective technique outperforms the Pareto double objective one, and manages a successful breach on a deep network wherein the average detection score falls to 0.446429. It is observed that besides the minimization of the detection rate score, the constraint of invisibility of noise is much more effective rather than having a conflicting objective of noise power minimization. © 2024 IEEE.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85199063619&doi=10.1109%2fTAI.2024.3429473&partnerID=40&md5=199c6c752858313c7a38a633ab37d16d,IEEE Transactions on Artificial Intelligence,2024
Dynamic Energy Management for UAV-Enabled VR Systems: A Tile-Based Collaboration Approach,"Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) have been envisioned as a promising technology to support wireless virtual reality (VR) applications. However, the huge energy consumption during the rendering process is challenging for UAV-enabled VR systems. The existing energy management strategies neglecting the dynamic and tiling features of VR tasks may not achieve optimal performance. To cope with these issues, we present a dynamic energy optimization framework for UAV-enabled VR systems. In the proposed framework, a tile-based collaborative rendering scheme for multi-UAVs is developed by exploiting the correlation among different tiles of VR users. Further, we formulate an optimization problem by jointly considering the collaboration decision, resource allocation, and UAV trajectory, aiming to reduce the long-term energy consumption under the motion-to-photon (MTP) latency requirement. Due to the tight coupling variables and the dynamic factors, the formulated problem is non-convex and difficult to tackle by adopting the traditional method. To this end, we first decompose the original problem into two sub-problems, i.e., the UAV trajectory and collaboration decision (UTCD) problem, and the resource allocation (RA) problem. Then, we design a dynamic UTCD algorithm based on deep reinforcement learning (DRL) and present an optimal RA algorithm based on the Lagrangian multiplier iterative (LMI) method. To enhance the solving efficiency, a block coordinate descent (BCD)-based solving method is introduced by embedding the RA algorithm in the learning environment of DRL. Finally, simulation results prove that the proposed scheme can obtain good performance for UAV-enabled VR systems. © 2024 IEEE.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85199108187&doi=10.1109%2fTVT.2024.3430311&partnerID=40&md5=0ccb8403dff7cafb0b3f5c3acfd819d5,IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology,2024

An RF-Visual Directional Fusion Framework for Precise UAV Positioning,"Anti-unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) systems are crucial for preventing unauthorized individuals from exploiting UAVs for illegal activities, including surveillance and attacks. Precise real-time positioning of small UAVs is the premise of the effective operation of anti-UAV systems. However, its performance is confined due to the small size of the target and its high susceptibility to disturbance caused by birds or other aircraft. To tackle this problem, a radio-frequency (RF)-visual directional fusion framework is proposed for precise UAV positioning. In the framework, radio signals are aligned with images by jointly calibrating the array antenna and camera. The spatial spectrum is extracted by an array antenna to concentrate on target areas within the image modal. Moreover, in order to improve the precision of joint calibration, a segmentation-based denoising method is proposed to remove the spectrum noise. Furthermore, a practical anti-UAV positioning platform is established, and two synchronized data sets, which include visual images and UAV RF signals, are collected on the platform. Experimental results demonstrate that our proposed framework improves positioning accuracy and robustness compared to the benchmark methods. © 2014 IEEE.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85199032305&doi=10.1109%2fJIOT.2024.3424271&partnerID=40&md5=a379912ac4be0f6bf9aab6ec63ddb639,IEEE Internet of Things Journal,2024
Dynamic Event-Triggered Distributed MPC for Heterogeneous UAVs-UGVs Against DoS Attacks,"In this study, we address the model predictive secure control challenge for a heterogeneous system composed of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) and unmanned ground vehicles (UGVs). Our objective is to cooperatively manage the UAVs-UGVs system to maintain equilibrium in the face of external disturbances and denial of service (DoS) attacks. We introduce a dynamic event-triggered distributed model predictive control (DET-Distributed MPC) approach. Initially, we integrate a robustness constraint into the distributed MPC framework, which incrementally tightens the states bounds, enhancing disturbance resilience. In addition, we devise a neighbor output sequence prediction mechanism to mitigate packet loss effects due to DoS attacks on communication channels. A dynamic event-triggered mechanism with adaptive triggering thresholds, responsive to DoS attack durations, is also developed. We establish sufficient conditions for the recursive feasibility of the MPC algorithm and the stability of the overall system. Comparative tests confirm the DET-Distributed MPC scheme's robustness and security efficacy.  © 2024 IEEE.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85198260767&doi=10.1109%2fTAES.2024.3422158&partnerID=40&md5=96bb75c9ec85a47b6905f229a3177289,IEEE Transactions on Aerospace and Electronic Systems,2024
Resilient Distributed Fixed-Time Tracking of Heterogeneous UAVs-UGVs Systems Against DoS Attacks,"The fixed-time cooperative control is investigated for heterogeneous multiagent systems (HMASs) containing multiple unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) and unmanned ground vehicles (UGVs) under Denial of Service (DoS) attacks and external perturbations. First, for the ease of collaborative tasks, an unified model is obtained in the XY plane by transforming the dynamical models of UAVs and UGVs. Then, a fuzzy switching observer is designed to achieve unavailable state estimation during the attack zone. In particular, in virtue of the character of DoS attacks, a novel fixed-time stability theory is set up. On this foundation, a distributed fixed-time secure tracking control strategy is raised by utilizing the adaptive approach to effectively defend against DoS attacks. Notably, distinct from the existing works on finite-time stability for HMASs, the present method exhibits some brilliant features, such as fast response, high accuracy, and attack resistance. Additionally, rational proofs have substantiated that the designed control scheme can not only ensure the boundedness of each closed-loop signal but also guarantee the synchronization error converges to a predefined small neighborhood near the origin in a fixed time. Ultimately, the validity of the proposed method is demonstrated by a representative simulation.  © 2013 IEEE.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85197629377&doi=10.1109%2fTSMC.2024.3408410&partnerID=40&md5=b33bbf25d734e10c113459b82011af25,"IEEE Transactions on Systems, Man, and Cybernetics: Systems",2024
Joint Trajectory and Primary-Secondary Transmission Design for UAV-Carried-IRS Assisted Underlay CR Networks,"A novel unmanned aerial vehicle-carried-intelligent reflecting surface (UAV-carried-IRS)-assisted underlay cognitive radio network (UAV-IRS-UCRN) is investigated, where dynamic UAV-carried-IRS inherits the advantages of IRS and adds a new motion dimension to flexibly assist the primary user (PU)-secondary user (SU) transmission, and both the PU and the SU enjoy seamless connectivity at all the times. A SU's average rate-maximized optimization problem is constructed under fully satisfying the service quality of PU. Since the strong coupling of the optimization variables makes solving this problem very tricky, the original problem is divided into the SU's transmitted power sub-problem, the phase shift matrix and the trajectory of UAV-carried-IRS sub-problems. Then, the sub-problems are solved by deriving the closed-form solution and exploiting semi-definite relaxation, charnes-cooper transformation and successive convex approximation techniques. Finally, a joint optimization algorithm based on alternating iterative framework is proposed to solve the original problem. Numerical results show that the performances of both PU and SU transmissions are significantly improved in contrast to only UAV-carried-IRS-assisted SU and fixed trajectory algorithms.  © 1967-2012 IEEE.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85198288386&doi=10.1109%2fTVT.2024.3425522&partnerID=40&md5=cfc71bf7518d37c9f834e90d871abd95,IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology,2024
Real-Time Collaborative Intrusion Detection System in UAV Networks Using Deep Learning,"Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) are being used extensively in various fields. UAVs provide various services to users, including monitoring, logistics, and sensing, because of their flexible deployment and dynamic reconfigurability. However, UAV networks have become more susceptible to malicious threats because of their multiconnectivity and openness. A great effort has been made to develop an effective intrusion detection system (IDS) based on machine-learning approaches for UAVs. Unfortunately, existing methods were unable to identify real time and zero-day attacks for UAV networks. This is due to that existing methods have still used obsolete data sets and past knowledge-based detection. Also, the shortcomings of standalone IDS render them unsuitable for defending UAV networks from potential security risks. Further, the lack of precise identification for compromised UAV nodes in UAV networks poses a critical security gap, risking the entire network's integrity with the compromise of a single node. Therefore, in this work, we propose an autonomous collaborative IDS (UAV-CIDS) with a feedforward convolutional neural network (FFCNN), which accurately identifies zero-day with high accuracy. The proposed solution takes into account encoded Wi-Fi traffic logs of three popular UAVs types: 1) DBPower UDI; 2) parrot Bebop; and 3) DJI spark. Evaluation results indicate that our FFCNN model has produced outstanding results based on the UAVIDS data set with 98.23% accuracy compared to existing models. After the detection of attacks, their mitigation is equally significant. In addition, we also design and implement real-time incident response handling against cyber-attacks on UAV Networks. The incident response handling will assist in minimizing the effects of a security breach, remediate vulnerabilities and systematically secure the entire UAV networks.  © 2024 IEEE.

SPR: Single-Scan Radar Place Recognition,"Localization is a crucial component for the navigation of autonomous vehicles. It encompasses global localization and place recognition, allowing a system to identify locations that have been mapped or visited before. Place recognition is commonly approached using cameras or LiDARs. However, these sensors are affected by bad weather or low lighting conditions. In this letter, we exploit automotive radars to address the problem of localizing a vehicle within a map using single radar scans. The effectiveness of radars is not dependent on environmental conditions, and they provide additional information not present in LiDARs such as Doppler velocity and radar cross section. However, the sparse and noisy radar measurement makes place recognition a challenge. Recent research in automotive radars addresses the sensor's limitations by aggregating multiple radar scans and using high-dimensional scene representations. We, in contrast, propose a novel neural network architecture that focuses on each point of single radar scans, without relying on an additional odometry input for scan aggregation. We extract pointwise local and global features, resulting in a compact scene descriptor vector. Our model improves local feature extraction by estimating the importance of each point for place recognition and enhances the global descriptor by leveraging the radar cross section information provided by the sensor. We evaluate our model using nuScenes and the 4DRadarDataset, which involve 2D and 3D automotive radar sensors. Our findings illustrate that our approach achieves state-of-the-art results for single-scan place recognition using automotive radars.  © 2016 IEEE.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85198311443&doi=10.1109%2fLRA.2024.3426369&partnerID=40&md5=b04388e0961451d6d365b71b46d28950,IEEE Robotics and Automation Letters,2024

Nevertheless, no much work has been devoted to the generation of datasets specifically designed to evaluate the adversarial robustness of neural models. This paper presents CARLA-GeAR, a tool for the automatic generation of photo-realistic synthetic datasets related to driving scenarios that can be used for a systematic evaluation of the adversarial robustness of neural models against physical adversarial patches, as well as for comparing the performance of different adversarial defense/detection methods. The tool is built on the CARLA simulator, using its Python API, and allows the generation of datasets for several vision tasks in the context of autonomous driving. The adversarial patches included in the generated datasets are attached to billboards or the back of a truck and are crafted by using state-of-The-Art white-box attack strategies to maximize the prediction error of the model under test.

An IoT-Based Deep-Learning Architecture to Secure Automated Electric Vehicles Against Cyberattacks and Data Loss,"In the realm of modern transportation, automated electric vehicles (AEVs) assume a seminal role in realizing the vision of intelligent and electrified mobility. The advancement of AEVs hinges on the utilization of smart Internet of Things (IoT) devices as indispensable components to propel their evolution. These devices not only amplify the operational capabilities of AEVs but also underpin their security in the face of escalating cyber threats. In this regard, this study proposes a novel IoT architectural paradigm, encompassing integration of model predictive control (MPC) and deep neural network (DNN) frameworks. The proposed architecture aims to enhance AEV performance, empowering them to counteract the disruptive impact of erroneous data intrusions that result from cyber breaches. To ensure the timely identification of potential threats without compromising privacy considerations, this study augments the framework to encompass trajectory prediction. This extension is achieved through dynamic programming (DP) to craft effective control strategies governing AEV motions, conjoined with DNNs adept in discerning deviations from projected behavioral norms within AEVs' control signals. This cohesive symbiosis propels the expeditious detection of anomalies indicative of potential security breaches. As data privacy remains a paramount consideration, this work employs Homomorphic Encryption, enabling anomaly score computation on encrypted data, thereby upholding privacy standards. Various test scenarios are conducted to emphasize the effectiveness of the proposed IoT architecture with MPC, DP, and DNN to improve the performance of the AEV. The results attest that the proposed approach can tackle cyberattacks and data loss effectively which enhances the production process and decision making.  © 2013 IEEE.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85197599278&doi=10.1109%2fTSMC.2024.3409314&partnerID=40&md5=f22f89e2490f434b7d68a4dc87460c2f,"IEEE Transactions on Systems, Man, and Cybernetics: Systems",2024
Safe Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning for Wireless Applications Against Adversarial Communications,"Based on the network observations and learning parameters shared by the neighboring learning agents, multi-agent reinforcement learning (RL) has to enhance the performance over adversarial communications, in which spoofing attackers send fake learning messages to fool the learning agent and thus degrade the performance of wireless applications. In this paper, we propose a safe multi-agent RL algorithm for wireless applications against adversarial communications, in which each learning agent chooses the cooperative agents to share the learning information and authenticates the received learning messages before integrating them into the RL state formulation and the learning parameter update. The communication policy distribution for the cooperative agent selection is formulated based on the long-term discounted reward and the sharing reputation for each neighboring agent, which is updated based on the authentication results to indicate the probability as a spoofing attacker. Neural networks are designed to estimate the long-term discounted reward and the sharing reputation for the learning agent with sufficient computational resources in large-scale wireless networks to enhance the agent selection security. As a case study, our proposed algorithm is implemented in the unmanned aerial vehicle swarm anti-jamming video transmission against spoofing attackers that send fake received jamming power as well as Q-values and neural network weights in the anti-jamming transmission policy learning.

Stealthy and Effective Physical Adversarial Attacks in Autonomous Driving,"In autonomous assistance systems, accurate camera vision is indispensable for driving safety. Featuring this safety-critical scenario, physical adversarial examples are arguably the most threatening. However, existing physical adversarial attacks are either conspicuous or ineffective, leaving a dilemma for balancing between attack effectiveness and stealthiness. In this paper, we put forth a new type of adversarial patch attack, leveraging the behavior characteristic of high-speed shutters in autonomous driving cameras. Instead of deploying static images onto real-world objects, we embed adversarial examples into videos and cast them with projectors. By delicately deciding the frame contents and display frequencies, the adversarial frame contents are almost invisible to humans, but high-speed shutters can capture them (see our demos (https://anonymous.4open.science/r/7003)). We demonstrate the attack feasibility by fooling traffic sign detectors, altering speed limit signs to be mis-detected or undetected, and hence manipulating the driving speed of victims. We conduct extensive experiments under various conditions, confirming that our new attack is effective and robust: It can deceive state-of-the-art detector models with success rates of 99% and over 90% in untargeted and targeted manners, respectively. Our further investigations unravel the transferability of our attack to other detectors in a black-box setting.  © 2005-2012 IEEE.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85197487586&doi=10.1109%2fTIFS.2024.3422920&partnerID=40&md5=43fe7ed5a23fba8e2f02d6ae2af2e0aa,IEEE Transactions on Information Forensics and Security,2024
Deep Reinforcement Learning With Dynamic Graphs for Adaptive Informative Path Planning,"Autonomousrobots are often employed for data collection due to their efficiency and low labour costs. A key task in robotic data acquisition is planning paths through an initially unknown environment to collect observations given platform-specific resource constraints, such as limited battery life. Adaptive online path planning in 3D environments is challenging due to the large set of valid actions and the presence of unknown occlusions. To address these issues, we propose a novel deep reinforcement learning approach for adaptively replanning robot paths to map targets of interest in unknown 3D environments. A key aspect of our approach is a dynamically constructed graph that restricts planning actions local to the robot, allowing us to react to newly discovered static obstacles and targets of interest. For replanning, we propose a new reward function that balances between exploring the unknown environment and exploiting online-discovered targets of interest. Our experiments show that our method enables more efficient target discovery compared to state-of-the-art learning and non-learning baselines. We also showcase our approach for orchard monitoring using an unmanned aerial vehicle in a photorealistic simulator.  © 2016 IEEE.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85197499543&doi=10.1109%2fLRA.2024.3421188&partnerID=40&md5=e80c3c5fdd49b3db1d2f628534839034,IEEE Robotics and Automation Letters,2024
Sparsely Connected Low Complexity CNN for Unmanned Vehicles Detection-Sensing RF Signal,"Unmanned aerial systems, namely drones, have greatly improved and expanded drastically over the years. Due to their efficiency and ease of use, drones have been utilized in a wide range of applications. Despite various potential uses, drones are also being utilized for illegal operations and exposing security threats to citizens. It is vital to install an effective anti-drone system to identify and defend against intruding malevolent drones to protect national security. Although there has been tremendous advancement in the development of machine learning to deploy lightweight architectures in the sensor industry, no such drone detection approach has yet been described in the literature. Therefore, this paper proposed a lightweight convolution neural network (CNN), namely RFDNet, to investigate the problem of 17 types of drone RF fingerprint classification problems in the low SNR regime. The network is configured with two principle modules, which are leveraged by the grouped and depth-wise convolution layers, incorporating accuracy improvement while keeping the complexity low. Notably, most existing networks fail to outstandingly detect drones at low SNR levels because the RF signal envelope is distorted and the transient information is lost in the noise. To solve this issue, we collected an open-source RF dataset that stores 17 types of drone RF signals at 30 dB SNR. To investigate the RF dataset at various SNR levels, we regenerate the dataset at different SNRs (i.e., -10dB to 30 dB SNR with the 5 dB interval) and analyze the performance of the proposed network. The empirical results show that RFDNet performed outstandingly compared to the existing deep learning-based drone detection methods and achieved an overall 99.07% accuracy at 15 dB signal-to-noise ratio (SNR).  © 1967-2012 IEEE.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85197560522&doi=10.1109%2fTVT.2024.3414437&partnerID=40&md5=1fab02a455917f028d0b4a32bf31d6fe,IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology,2024
An Auto-Upgradable End-to-End Preauthenticated Secure Communication Protocol for UAV-Aided Perception Intelligent System,"Unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV)-enabled intelligent systems are emerging and empowering real-time monitoring and modeling tasks. The security requirements in real-time UAV-enabled intelligent systems are data integrity, authenticity, traceability, tamper-proofing, and privacy. A secure channel established by authenticated key agreement (AKA) protocol can cover all the security requirements. However, no UDP-based lightweight pairing-free AKA protocol has been proposed for the UAV system. In this article, we propose a UDP-compatible Curve25519-infrastructural identity-based end-to-end pre-AKA protocol (UDP-IBE2E-pAKA) with system auto-upgrading and direct and lifecycle credential revocation as a lightweight and reliable UDP-based secure communication module for UAV-enabled networks, which perfectly fits the rapid mobility and extremely harsh work environments of UAVs. To protect UAV-enabled systems stable from DDoS attacks, we construct an efficient identity-based signature as a preauthentication mechanism for the verifier to directly authenticate the sender without any redundant operations. In addition, to prevent the corrupted UAV from monitoring and disrupting attacks, our protocol can revoke the malicious entities directly and immediately with a revocation list in the authentication phase. Moreover, online mode auto-upgradable algorithms are designed to achieve key exposure resistance in our protocol. The full proof of the authenticity and privacy are given in this article. The comprehensive comparison with other state-of-the-art end-to-end AKA protocols indicates that our protocol meets the most robustness and highest efficiency on Raspberry Pi 5.  © 2014 IEEE.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85196547155&doi=10.1109%2fJIOT.2024.3413010&partnerID=40&md5=df8a5e1cdd6249fff9e5a861b30bb7b2,IEEE Internet of Things Journal,2024
BeTAIL: Behavior Transformer Adversarial Imitation Learning From Human Racing Gameplay,"Autonomous racing poses a significant challenge for control, requiring planning minimum-time trajectories under uncertain dynamics and controlling vehicles at their handling limits. Current methods requiring hand-designed physical models or reward functions specific to each car or track. In contrast, imitation learning uses only expert demonstrations to learn a control policy. Imitated policies must model complex environment dynamics and human decision-making. Sequence modeling is highly effective in capturing intricate patterns of motion sequences but struggles to adapt to new environments or distribution shifts that are common in real-world robotics tasks. In contrast, Adversarial Imitation Learning (AIL) can mitigate this effect, but struggles with sample inefficiency and handling complex motion patterns. Thus, we propose BeTAIL: Behavior Transformer Adversarial Imitation Learning, which combines a Behavior Transformer (BeT) policy from human demonstrations with online AIL. BeTAIL adds an AIL residual policy to the BeT policy to model the sequential decision-making process of human experts and correct for out-of-distribution states or shifts in environment dynamics. We test BeTAIL on three challenges with expert-level demonstrations of real human gameplay in the high-fidelity racing game Gran Turismo Sport. Our proposed BeTAIL reduces environment interactions and improves racing performance and stability, even when the BeT is pretrained on different tracks than downstream learning.  © 2016 IEEE.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85196480643&doi=10.1109%2fLRA.2024.3416789&partnerID=40&md5=d80bd871daadb8697aea07b1b030a12b,IEEE Robotics and Automation Letters,2024

To avoid data conflict in the communication network with limited bandwidth, SCP modeled by discrete-time Markov chain is introduced to schedule the transmitted signals, which are subjected to deception attacks described by a random process. In addition, the mode-dependent observer and controller are utilized in line with the scheduling situations led by SCP. Moreover, the stochastic stability of the augmented dynamics is ensured by the presented sufficient condition. Meanwhile, the corresponding gain parameters of the observer and controller can be computed.

Task Scheduling and Trajectory Optimization Based on Fairness and Communication Security for Multi-UAV-MEC System,"Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) show significant potential in enhancing communication services within the mobile edge computing (MEC) system by taking their advantages on the flexible mobility and reliable line-of-sight links. However, in the scenarios with multiple UAV-MECs (UMs) operating concurrently, potential conflicts in their trajectories need to be mitigated. Thus, the 3-D trajectory needs to be properly designed in a highly reliable manner. Besides, such an infrastructure-free communication paradigm also exposes a potential risk of misuse by malicious parties, which allows them to eavesdrop on private communications, posing a threat to the security and privacy. Therefore, we consider a multi-UAV-assisted MEC communication system, where a UAV maliciously eavesdrops on the data transmission from the user devices (UDs) while a jammer is deployed on the ground to interfere with the eavesdropping channel. In specific, our objective is to minimize the energy consumption and latency while incorporating fairness metrics by optimizing the 3-D trajectories of UMs, transmission power of UDs, and the offloading strategies under the constraints of ensuring communication security and load fairness. Given the complexity of this mixed-integer nonconvex programming problem, we decompose the formulated problem into three subproblems. Specifically, at each time slot, we optimize the transmit power and offloading strategies using theoretical derivation and mathematical analysis, respectively. Additionally, a multiagent deep deterministic policy gradient (MADDPG) algorithm is employed to optimize the trajectories of UMs. Simulation results demonstrate that our proposed joint optimization algorithm successfully minimizes the system energy consumption and delay as compared to benchmarking schemes.  © 2014 IEEE.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85196074209&doi=10.1109%2fJIOT.2024.3412825&partnerID=40&md5=f19c76e6e5f986d8335ea27a0a77565f,IEEE Internet of Things Journal,2024

Factor Graph-Based Planning as Inference for Autonomous Vehicle Racing,"Factor graph, as a bipartite graphical model, offers a structured representation by revealing local connections among graph nodes. This study explores the utilization of factor graphs in modeling the autonomous racecar planning problem, presenting an alternate perspective to the traditional optimizationbased formulation. We model the planning problem as a probabilistic inference over a factor graph, with factor nodes capturing the joint distribution of motion objectives. By leveraging the duality between optimization and inference, a fast solution to the maximum a posteriori estimation of the factor graph is obtained via least-squares optimization. The localized design thinking inherent in this formulation ensures that motion objectives depend on a small subset of variables. We exploit the locality feature of the factor graph structure to integrate the minimum curvature path and local planning computations into a unified algorithm. This diverges from the conventional separation of global and local planning modules, where curvature minimization occurs at the global level. The evaluation of the proposed framework demonstrated superior performance for cumulative curvature and average speed across the racetrack. Furthermore, the results highlight the computational efficiency of our approach. While acknowledging the structural design advantages and computational efficiency of the proposed methodology, we also address its limitations and outline potential directions for future research.  © 2020 IEEE.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85197052537&doi=10.1109%2fOJITS.2024.3418956&partnerID=40&md5=7a6ec4d0ddca3b2066bf3b692e8f2d1c,IEEE Open Journal of Intelligent Transportation Systems,2024
Secure Ultra-Reliable and Low Latency Communication in UAV-Enabled NOMA Wireless Networks,"Combing unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) with nonorthogonal multiple access (NOMA) in ultra-reliable and low latency communication (uRLLC) is deemed as a new service category of 5G wireless networks. The openness nature of wireless environment makes security of information transmission unprecedentedly importance. Traditional cryptography methods cannot cater to uRLLC due to high complex design and processing delay. As a result, physical layer security (PLS) has been designed to secure information transmission by exploiting intrinsic property of wireless channel. However, many prior works ignored the role of UAV in study of PLS in uRLLC, and mobility of UAV deserves further investigation. This paper studies security and reliability performances of UAV-based uRLLC by using NOMA, where two kinds of users with different requirements are served, i.e., users with privacy and low latency requirement (PLR), and users with reliability and low latency requirement (RLR). With the tools of stochastic geometry, we formulate the secrecy rate, a popular metric in study of PLS, by establishing the closed-form expressions for static and dynamic UAV.

Efficient Adversarial Attack Strategy Against 3D Object Detection in Autonomous Driving Systems,"The reliability and robustness of 3D object detection play an instrumental role in the practical deployment of autonomous driving systems. Despite previous research indicating that adversarial examples can negatively affect 3D object detection models, leading to misinterpretations of the environment, these models still maintain the capability to detect the majority of objects within adversarially manipulated point clouds. To further probe into the adversarial robustness of these models, we propose an effective adversarial attack method named IoU-S attack in this paper. We meticulously formulate the adversarial loss to adversely affect the decision-making behavior (such as localization, etc.) of 3D object detection, thereby compromising its ability to accurately interpret the environment. Owing to the significant relevance of this adversarial loss to 3D object detection tasks, we have integrated the IoU-S attack into three attack paradigms: point cloud perturbation, detachment, and attachment. Comprehensive experiments on the widely accepted nuScenes dataset illustrate that the IoU-S attack outperforms existing attack methods in both white-box and black-box scenarios (https://github.com/haichen-ber/IoU-S-Attack). It reinforces its potential to serve as a valuable method in understanding and enhancing the robustness of 3D object detection models against adversarial attacks.  © 2024 IEEE.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85196069101&doi=10.1109%2fTITS.2024.3410038&partnerID=40&md5=e5fb0d7cd6f5ff283ac4e79ea533a8e0,IEEE Transactions on Intelligent Transportation Systems,2024
"Railway Intrusion Detection Based on Machine Vision: A Survey, Challenges, and Perspectives","Railway intrusion seriously threatens railway safety and can cause enormous loss of life and property. Therefore, railway intrusion detection is crucial for the safety of railway operation. Among the current methods of intrusion detection, machine vision-based methods have been widely used in railways, and have attracted close attention because of their great benefits. This paper proposes a comprehensive review of railway intrusion detection based on machine vision, covering ground monitoring, on-board inspection, and unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) inspection. First, this paper systematically reviews most of the studies over the past two decades and presents the survey in three parts. Second, by analyzing these studies and the requirements for railway monitoring, we summarize the major challenges that hinder railway intrusion detection based on machine vision. Finally, we propose several promising perspectives for railway intrusion detection based on machine vision by comprehensively considering the development of machine vision, sensors, and pattern recognition together with the needs of railway scenes.  © 2000-2011 IEEE.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85196716486&doi=10.1109%2fTITS.2024.3412170&partnerID=40&md5=b7a641d7f9d16441df200dc81d5363e4,IEEE Transactions on Intelligent Transportation Systems,2024
Edge-Based Event-Triggered Platooning Control of Heterogeneous Connected Automated Vehicles Under Replay Attacks,"This paper investigates the problem of secure platooning control of heterogeneous connected automated vehicles under replay attacks. An edge-based dynamic event-triggered mechanism (DETM) is developed to relieve the vehicle-to-vehicle communication burden among the connected platoon. Different from the widely used constant time headway policies, a refined constant time headway (RCTH) policy that leverages the relative velocity between adjacent vehicles is adopted to enhance platooning safety while preserving traffic efficiency. To deal with the discrepancy of vehicle dynamic parameters, heterogeneity compensators are developed for each platoon member to estimate the platoon leader's state. By virtue of the switching system theory, the desired parameters of heterogeneity compensators are designed and the tolerable condition of replay attacks is also established. Furthermore, sufficient design criteria are derived to obtain the local compensator-based controller gains under the proposed edge-based DETM and RCTH policy. It is further proved that Zeno freeness of the proposed edge-based DETMs is excluded. Finally, co-simulations of Matlab/Simulink and CarSim are carried out to verify the efficacy of the derived results.  © 2024 IEEE.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85197071461&doi=10.1109%2fTVT.2024.3420451&partnerID=40&md5=b1508ddd5487c2f173d3e5a6f7d616fd,IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology,2024
Vehicular Ad Hoc Networks Topology Optimization for Autonomous Intersection Management System: A Periodic Intervention-Based Approach,"It is important to achieve the real-time and reliable vehicular ad hoc networks (VANETs) for the safety and efficiency of the autonomous intersection management (AIM) system. However, there are challenges in establishing the low-delay and robustness VANETs topology in a horizon due to the high mobility, intersection shelters and malicious attacks. This paper investigates the long-horizon VANETs networking problem with the objective of producing the robust topology in the process of routing paths planning. To achieve this goal, a centralized periodic intervention networking (CPIN) approach is proposed, which consists of three main modules: long-horizon information mapping, full-path routing modeling and proactive optimization mechanism. The first module aims to provide a spatio-temporal delay tensor, considering the mobility and the quality of service (QoS). The second module converts routing path planning into a combinatorial optimization problem to achieve long-horizon full-path routing. The third module introduces a proactive optimization mechanism based on node degree centrality to evolve the VANETs networking process toward high robustness. To find the optimal solution efficiently, we propose an improved Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) algorithm based on the operational characteristics of the AIM system. A series of simulation experiments are carried out to verify the effectiveness of CPIN. The results show that the CPIN outperforms the benchmark method in terms of time delay, wireless hops, and network robustness. Specifically, the CPIN reduces the average time delay by at most 44.4%-48.3% while ensuring relative high robustness.  © 2024 IEEE.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85196735675&doi=10.1109%2fTITS.2024.3412771&partnerID=40&md5=c49e99b0086597f0673c8e7196124fc8,IEEE Transactions on Intelligent Transportation Systems,2024
UAV-Aided Lifelong Learning for AoI and Energy Optimization in Nonstationary IoT Networks,"In this article, a novel joint energy and Age of Information (AoI) optimization framework for Internet of Things (IoT) devices in a nonstationary environment is presented. In particular, IoT devices that are distributed in the real-world are required to efficiently utilize their computing resources so as to balance the freshness of their data and their energy consumption. To optimize the performance of IoT devices in such a dynamic setting, a novel lifelong reinforcement learning (RL) solution that enables IoT devices to continuously adapt their policies to each newly encountered environment is proposed. Given that IoT devices have limited energy and computing resources, an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) is leveraged to visit the IoT devices and update the policy of each device sequentially. As such, the UAV is exploited as a mobile learning agent that can learn a shared knowledge base with a feature base in its training phase, and feature sets of a zero-shot learning method in its testing phase, to generalize between the environments. To optimize the trajectory and flying velocity of the UAV, an actor-critic network is leveraged so as to minimize the UAV energy consumption. Simulation results show that the proposed lifelong RL solution can outperform the state-of-art benchmarks by enhancing the balanced cost of IoT devices by 8.3% when incorporating warm-start policies for unseen environments. In addition, our solution achieves up to 49.38% reduction in terms of energy consumption by the UAV in comparison to the random flying strategy.  © 2014 IEEE.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85194890855&doi=10.1109%2fJIOT.2024.3406220&partnerID=40&md5=c57159eb093d42a1629eb7e410eb065e,IEEE Internet of Things Journal,2024
SR-Adv: Salient Region Adversarial Attacks on 3D Point Clouds for Autonomous Driving,"Autonomous driving safety based on LiDAR perception is increasingly becoming a hot spot. Specifically, 3D adversarial examples always make the prediction results of deep neural network models unpredictable, which poses a major security risk to autonomous driving systems. However, the vulnerability of 3D neural network models to adversarial examples is less explored. At present, existing adversarial attack methods often obtain 3D adversarial examples by perturbing the entire point cloud, which requires a large number of perturbed points, i.e. requires a large perturbation budget. In this paper, we propose a Salient Region Adversarial attack method (SR-Adv) to generate adversarial point clouds, by perturbing fewer regions and fewer points. To our knowledge, we are the first to propose region-based attacks for 3D point clouds. First, the proposed SR-Adv employs game theory to extract salient regions of point clouds. This mechanism assigns a value to each region to measure its importance to the 3D neural network model prediction results and realizes the vulnerability analysis of the 3D model. Second, we propose a novel optimization-based gradient attack algorithm to achieve adversarial attacks on salient regions. We evaluate the proposed SR-Adv attack method on the synthetic datasets ModelNet40 and ShapeNetPart as well as the real-world dataset KITTI and NuScenes. Experimental results show that the proposed SR-Adv achieves a state-of-the-art attack success rate and better imperceptibility by perturbing fewer points on 3D point clouds.  © 2024 IEEE.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85195372366&doi=10.1109%2fTITS.2024.3406153&partnerID=40&md5=c6086414978382098db2da3ae7859234,IEEE Transactions on Intelligent Transportation Systems,2024
IOOSC-U2G: An Identity-Based Online/Offline Signcryption Scheme for Unmanned Aerial Vehicle to Ground Station Communication,"With recent progress in Internet of Things technology, it is becoming more and more commonplace to use unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) for inconsiderable purposes. On the other hand, traditionally all of these UAV networks adopt a susceptible open wireless communication, rendering these systems vulnerable to attacks like eavesdropping, tampering, interrupting, and forging. The most effective way to address these security challenges is through signcryption. However, the current signcryption methods are computational and bandwidth intensive, making them unsuitable for the UAVs with limited resources and ground stations (GSs) handling a high volume of messages. To address these challenges, we propose a solution employing an identity-based online/offline signcryption scheme to secure communication from an UAV to GS, known as IOOSC-U2G. This scheme leverages elliptic curve cryptography without the need for time-intensive operations like bilinear pairing. During the online phase, the absence of point multiplication operations, already executed in the offline phase, significantly alleviates computational burdens. This optimization significantly reduces computational overhead throughout the entire signcryption process of messages. Moreover, the IOOSC-U2G scheme ensures the privacy of UAV identities during communication with GS. Additionally, the proposed scheme empowers the GS to verify multiple inputs at once through the batch verification method. We demonstrate that within the random oracle model, the IOOSC-U2G scheme guarantees security, specifically confidentiality and unforgeability, relying on the computational hardness assumptions of the elliptic curve inverse computational Diffie-Hellman problem and the elliptic discrete logarithm problem, respectively. Moreover, our scheme outperforms the current methods, particularly in computational and communication efficiency.  © 2024 IEEE.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85195375622&doi=10.1109%2fJIOT.2024.3407767&partnerID=40&md5=84f1d01d5a49ac5bf1c6d7a7e7eb1b5d,IEEE Internet of Things Journal,2024
A Distributed Multi-Vehicle Coordination Algorithm for Navigation in Tight Environments,"This work presents a distributed method for multi-vehicle coordination based on nonlinear model predictive control (NMPC) and dual decomposition. Our approach allows the vehicles to coordinate in tight spaces (e.g., busy highway lanes or parking lots) by using a polytopic description of each vehicle's shape and formulating collision avoidance as a dual optimization problem. Our method accommodates heterogeneous teams of vehicles (i.e., vehicles with different polytopic shapes and dynamic models can be part of the same team). Our method allows the vehicles to share their intentions in a distributed fashion without relying on a central coordinator and efficiently provides collision-free trajectories for the vehicles. In addition, our method decouples the individual-vehicles' trajectory optimization from their collision-avoidance objectives enhancing the scalability of the method and allowing one to exploit parallel hardware architectures. All these features are particularly important for vehicular applications, where the systems operate at high-frequency rates in dynamic environments. To validate our method, we apply it in a vehicular application, that is, the autonomous lane-merging of a team of connected vehicles to form a platoon. We compare our design with the centralized NMPC design to show the computational benefits of the proposed distributed algorithm.  © 1967-2012 IEEE.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85195408224&doi=10.1109%2fTVT.2024.3409687&partnerID=40&md5=51373e1a2c645e3d65eaeec3e69d7c58,IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology,2024
Distributed Fault-Tolerant Consensus Control of Vehicle Platoon Systems With DoS Attacks,"Vehicle platoon systems are regarded as autonomous vehicles in the platooning pattern, in which vehicles drive in sequence and maintain the desired inter-vehicle spacing. This paper investigates the platoon control problem of vehicle platoon dynamics under cyber-physical threats through the distributed fault-tolerant consensus control protocol. Complicated sensor and actuator faults in the physical layer and aperiodic denial-of-service (DoS) attacks in the cyber layer are modeled, respectively. Decentralized fault-estimation unknown input observers and event-triggered distributed anti-DoS-attack fault-tolerant consensus controllers are devised in a co-designed framework, thus maintaining not only the tolerance and resilience of platoon consensus errors and estimation errors but also the secure vehicle avoidance spacing by virtue of attack frequency and average dwelling time indicators.

Modeling and Simulation of Driving Risk Pulse Field and Its Application in Car Following Model,"For assisted driving or unmanned driving, various information acquisition and comprehensive and effective information utilization will make the driving assistance system and the driving measures more reliable. With the support of advanced information acquisition, information interaction and other technologies, measuring the risk threat capability of each traffic element, and using potential field theory and risk pulse theory can effectively describe the risk distribution in the road traffic environment, which is conducive to ensuring driving safety and the implementation of driving control. In this paper, we use the risk pulse energy to measure the threat ability of each traffic element, establish the corresponding driving risk pulse field based on the risk analysis of each traffic element, measure the overall risk performance and overall level of the road traffic environment from the perspectives of vector superposition and quantity superposition, and establish a unified driving risk pulse field model. The characteristics of the established driving risk pulse field model are simulated and described, including basic risk pulse energy, random risk pulse energy and relevant parameters. Taking GM model as an example, a car following model based on driving risk pulse field is established by combining driving risk pulse field with GM model. Finally, the simulation analysis of car following model considering driving risk pulse field is carried out by taking a typical car following scene as an example. The results show that the car following model considering the impact of driving risk pulse field has the following advantages: (i) It can take into consideration the impact of the front and rear vehicle motion state changes on the current vehicle driving. (ii) The headway can be adjusted according to the change of the risk pulse energy of the front and rear vehicles. (iii) It is able to select appropriate driving strategies according to the risk pulse energy level of the front and rear vehicles. The whole process aims to minimize the risk threat to the vehicles. (iv) Based on the description of the driving risk pulse field, the visualization of the driving environment risk can be realized, and we can directly see and understand the driving risk situation and facilitate the appropriate and reasonable driving measures.  © 2000-2011 IEEE.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85195371844&doi=10.1109%2fTITS.2024.3404933&partnerID=40&md5=6feb6c49aa873f9a23575f3da07fdcdc,IEEE Transactions on Intelligent Transportation Systems,2024
Landmark-Based Vehicle Self-Localization Using Automotive Polarimetric Radars,"Automotive self-localization is an essential task for any automated driving function. This means that the vehicle has to reliably know its position and orientation with an accuracy of a few centimeters and degrees, respectively. This paper presents a radar-based approach to self-localization, which exploits fully polarimetric scattering information for robust landmark detection. The proposed method requires no input from sensors other than radar during localization for a given map. By association of landmark observations with map landmarks, the vehicle's position is inferred. Abstract point- and line-shaped landmarks allow for compact map sizes and, in combination with the factor graph formulation used, for an efficient implementation. Evaluation of extensive real-world experiments in diverse environments shows a promising overall localization performance of 0.12m RMS absolute trajectory and 0.43° RMS heading error by leveraging the polarimetric information. A comparison of the performance of different levels of polarimetric information proves the advantage in challenging scenarios.  © 2000-2011 IEEE.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85195394027&doi=10.1109%2fTITS.2024.3397075&partnerID=40&md5=ccaa2e81b15702c81177637ae08b8830,IEEE Transactions on Intelligent Transportation Systems,2024
Multiple Unmanned Aerial Vehicles Coalition Formation and Control for Collaborative Defense Mission,"This article investigates the collaborative defense problem of multiple unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) in a 3-D space with an important area. A two-phase defense strategy is proposed for multiple defending UAVs (defenders) to cooperatively prevent the adversarial UAVs (intruders) from approaching the important area. In the first phase, considering that a single defender may lack the ability to neutralize an intruder independently, a game-theoretical-based coalition formation algorithm is proposed to drive defenders to form different-sized defending coalitions to neutralize multiple intruders with different abilities. In the second phase, once a defending coalition is established, a distributed enclosing control protocol is presented to guide the coalition members to collaboratively form an enclosing configuration around the detected intruder, the purpose of which is to restrict the movement of the intruder. Both the coalition formation algorithm and the enclosing control protocol are designed based on the local interactions with the neighboring defenders, which are scalable and executable. Simulation tests demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed strategy. Meanwhile, the scalability and flexibility of the proposed strategy are also discussed in detail. © 2024 IEEE.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85194095452&doi=10.1109%2fTAES.2024.3402658&partnerID=40&md5=46e86b66abb58e996031700b45401062,IEEE Transactions on Aerospace and Electronic Systems,2024
A Recurrent CNN for Online Object Detection on Raw Radar Frames,"Automotive radar sensors provide valuable information for advanced driving assistance systems (ADAS). Radars can reliably estimate the distance to an object and the relative velocity, regardless of weather and light conditions. However, radar sensors suffer from low resolution and huge intra-class variations in the shape of objects. Exploiting the time information (e.g, multiple frames) has been shown to help to capture better the dynamics of objects and, therefore, the variation in the shape of objects. Most temporal radar object detectors use 3D convolutions to learn spatial and temporal information. However, these methods are often non-causal and unsuitable for real-time applications. This work presents RECORD, a new recurrent CNN architecture for online radar object detection. We propose an end-to-end trainable architecture mixing convolutions and ConvLSTMs to learn spatio-temporal dependencies between successive frames. Our model is causal and requires only the past information encoded in the memory of the ConvLSTMs to detect objects. Our experiments show such a method's relevance for detecting objects in different radar representations (range-Doppler, range-angle) and outperform state-of-the-art models on the ROD2021 and CARRADA datasets while being less computationally expensive.  © 2000-2011 IEEE.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85195415935&doi=10.1109%2fTITS.2024.3404076&partnerID=40&md5=354b089b23e9b30413963863c2ffaad2,IEEE Transactions on Intelligent Transportation Systems,2024
Efficient Vehicular Collaborative Perception Based on Saptial-Temporal Feature Compression,"In collaborative perception, autonomous vehicles with limited perception capabilities can communicate with each other to achieve a more holographic and effective perception result. Real-world communication systems, however, are usually constrained by wireless communication resources or reliability and cannot handle the enormous real-time data transmissions to support the delay-sensitive collaborative perception. To resolve this issue, we propose an efficient vehicular Collaborative Perception method based on Spatial-temporal feature Compression (CPSC) that exploits the trade-off between perception performance and bandwidth consumption. It performs feature-level compression by focusing on critical regions of perceptual information in the spatial-temporal domain and adapts traffic according to network conditions. To the best of our knowledge, this paper presents the first work where temporal feature redundancy is considered for enhancing the efficiency of collaborative perception. To thoroughly evaluate CPSC, we conduct extensive experiments of collaborative 3D object detection tasks on the real-world dataset DAIR-V2X and the simulated dataset OPV2V. The results show that CPSC outperforms the SOTA collaborative perception methods by 2.91% for AP@0.7 in OPV2V dataset and 1.71% for AP@0.5 in DAIR-V2X dataset. Meanwhile, CPSC attains a communication volume reduction of more than 10 times while consistently outperforming the previous SOTA method. © 1967-2012 IEEE.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85195379758&doi=10.1109%2fTVT.2024.3403263&partnerID=40&md5=0072c512d3dbe9cf1346e161f2181ad1,IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology,2024

A UAV-Centric Improved Soft Actor-Critic Algorithm for QoE-Focused Aerial Video Streaming,"The increasing demand for uninterrupted connectivity emphasises the pivotal role of Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) in facilitating real-time video streaming, despite the challenges associated with highly dynamic air-to-ground communications. Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL)-based solutions (on-policy) are designed to optimize specific quality of experience (QoE) objectives, such as video quality and smoothness when networks fluctuate. However, they are vulnerable to different hyperparameters and have poor sample efficiency. To overcome this problem, we propose an improved off-policy soft actor-critic (SAC) solution, named I-SAC, which provides an exceptional exploration-exploitation trade-off for UAV-based aerial video streaming. I-SAC trains a neural network by jointly considering the video playback status, UAV flight metrics like altitude, velocity, and acceleration, as well as prior network conditions with the goal of maximizing the overall QoE. We design a new QoE metric that considers video quality, video quality oscillations, re-buffering, latency, and bandwidth utilization. We evaluate I-SAC with extensive real-world bandwidth settings, UAV flights, and multi-duration segment datasets. The trace-driven simulation results demonstrate that I-SAC significantly outperforms the closest on-policy and off-policy DRL-based alternative solutions in terms of QoE. Specifically, I-SAC achieves average QoE improvements of up to 54.32% under different testing scenarios. © 1967-2012 IEEE.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85194036875&doi=10.1109%2fTVT.2024.3396349&partnerID=40&md5=9c1523bc5c62948bd8f6643bae8e1c66,IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology,2024
Energy-Efficient 3-D UAV Ground Node Accessing Using the Minimum Number of UAVs,"Cooperative multiple unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) have been widely exploited in various applications, including data collection, forest monitoring, edge computing, and so on. Due to limited onboard storage and expensive hardware costs, reducing both the energy consumption and the number of UAVs is critical for these multi-UAV applications. However, existing studies primarily revolved around energy minimization in two-dimensional (2-D) scenarios, given a sufficient but fixed number of UAVs, and most of them considered specific application scenarios, resulting in poor generality. In contrast, this paper defines a generalized application scenario, in which multiple ground nodes (GNs) are accessed by multiple UAVs in three-dimensional (3-D) scenarios, and aims to minimize the energy consumption by employing the necessary (or equivalently minimum) number of UAVs and formulating a mix-integer nonconvex problem. To this end, this paper decomposes the problem into two subproblems: energy consumption minimization for a single UAV consecutively accessing any two GNs and energy-efficient multi-UAV GN-accessing path planning employing the minimum number of UAVs. The first subproblem is solved by applying the successive convex approximation (SCA) technique and the path discretization method, while the second subproblem is addressed by designing a three-stage approximation framework based on modified particle swarm optimization (MPSO) and greedy path assignment (GPA). Comprehensive simulations demonstrate the superior performance of the proposed method in terms of optimality and efficiency compared to several other counterparts. © 2002-2012 IEEE.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85194852025&doi=10.1109%2fTMC.2024.3405494&partnerID=40&md5=b53803e36ee710cd78dc62a5b287334d,IEEE Transactions on Mobile Computing,2024
OptiCloak: Blinding Vision-Based Autonomous Driving Systems Through Adversarial Optical Projection,"Studies have proven that applying patch stickers generated through adversarial training to target objects can effectively deceive classifiers or target detectors. These 'Print-and-paste' adversarial attacks however have three shortcomings. First, touching the target object physically is required, which may be infeasible in practice. Second, stickers might be taken as evidence to identify the attackers. Third, the attack effect decreases significantly in poor light, especially at long distances. To overcome above limitations, we introduce OptiCloak, a car vanishing attack, which fools the object detector (OD) of a vision-based autonomous driving systems with transient projection pattern. We establish three digital-to-physical mapping models to compensate the distortions caused by perspective deformation, double image, and partial light reflection in real world. Furthermore, to avoid adversarial functionality degeneration caused by the loss of patch details in long-range attacks, we utilize MeanShift Filtering to constrain the 'resolution' of pixels in a patch during training. We propose a gradient-free patch updating (GPU) approach, which utilizes ZO-AdaMM to approximate gradients and model parameters through the confidence scores of OD, making OptiCloak can work well in both the white-box and black-box scenarios. We deploy OptiCloak in real-world driving scenarios, and the extensive experimental results demonstrate that the OptiCloak achieves similar attack success rates (ASRs) as printed patches in bright environments, while significantly improving the attack performance in gloomy environments. This effect is validated across all settings, including different angles, imaging devices, and film transparency rates.

An Autonomous Attack Decision-Making Method Based on Hierarchical Virtual Bayesian Reinforcement Learning,"In response to the challenges of estimating missile launch timing during close-range unmanned autonomous air combat in the future, this article proposes an autonomous attack decision-making method based on hierarchical virtual Bayesian reinforcement learning (HVBRL). First, a six-degree-of-freedom (6-DOF) high-fidelity aircraft dynamics model, along with missile dynamics and guidance rate models, is constructed. Second, the HVBRL algorithm is introduced, where the low-level algorithm outputs control parameters and the high-level algorithm generates control commands. Given that the number of missile hits on a target under specific conditions follows a binomial distribution, a simple prior knowledge can be introduced through its conjugate prior, the Beta distribution, to avoid prolonged exploration of ineffective areas. Moreover, carrying only a limited number of missiles and predicting the number of hits by multiple virtual missiles in specific states through a neural network circumvent the computational complexity issue associated with carrying an excessive number of missiles. Finally, this article presents the low-level training algorithm, the high-level training algorithm, and the high-level self-play training algorithm. Experimental results show that our method significantly reduces the simulation computational complexity. Compared with the Monte Carlo method carrying 1000 missiles, the simulation speed of the high-level training algorithm is increased by 32.75 times, and that of the high-level self-play algorithm is increased by 23 times. Moreover, the estimated missile hit probability with bias can effectively guide the timing of missile launches in close-range air combat, which has significant implications for intelligent autonomous air combat decision-making and operational analysis.  © 1965-2011 IEEE.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85195381390&doi=10.1109%2fTAES.2024.3410249&partnerID=40&md5=f80e6728dae11bdecdf64b13fbdf1869,IEEE Transactions on Aerospace and Electronic Systems,2024
On the Prediction of the Sideslip Angle Using Dynamic Neural Networks,"With the growing interest in self-driving vehicles, safety in vehicle driving is becoming an increasingly important aspect. The sideslip angle is a key quantity for modern control systems that aim to improve passenger safety. It directly affects the lateral motion and stability of a vehicle. In particular, a large sideslip angle can cause the vehicle to experience oversteer or understeer, which can lead to loss of control and potentially result in an accident. For this reason, it is necessary to constantly monitor this quantity while driving in order to implement appropriate action if necessary. Sensors that directly measure this quantity are expensive and difficult to implement. In this paper, two neural networks to estimate the sideslip angle are proposed. The quantities that most influence the vehicle's sideslip angle were assessed. Furthermore, the neural networks can exploit data from previous instants of time for estimation purposes. In particular, the first uses lateral acceleration and steering wheel angle as input, the second uses longitudinal acceleration, lateral acceleration and yaw rate. Experimental tests carried out on manoeuvres that stimulate the sideslip angle have shown that, although the estimators use few measures, they are able to accurately estimate the quantity of interest. © 2020 IEEE.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85194839054&doi=10.1109%2fOJITS.2024.3405797&partnerID=40&md5=73f6e07d817e017d05fc56b25b3a22d0,IEEE Open Journal of Intelligent Transportation Systems,2024
AodeMar: Attention-Aware Occlusion Detection of Vessels for Maritime Autonomous Surface Ships,"For maritime autonomous surface ships (MASS), challenges exist in visual detection of occluded marine vessels since invisible occlusion is required to be inferred from locally unoccluded features which are weakly related to the entirety. In this paper, an attention-aware occlusion detection scheme of marine vessels, termed AodeMar, is originated from the viewpoint of MASS transportation. To this end, a position enhancement module is created by virtue of residual connections and coordinate attentions such that high-level semantics and spatial feature dependencies can be efficiently exploited, respectively, thereby accurately locating bounding boxes. Moreover, a multi-scale feature semantics correlation block is devised by combining spatial pyramid pooling and swin transformer-based self-attention encoder in order that the classification ability can be fertilized in both global and local sense. Experiments and comparisons show that the proposed AodeMar outperforms typical approaches including Faster R-CNN, SSD and YOLO series in terms of detection accuracy and robustness.  © 2000-2011 IEEE.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85194068358&doi=10.1109%2fTITS.2024.3398733&partnerID=40&md5=973350764ff6edbbd1967c9c06d1985d,IEEE Transactions on Intelligent Transportation Systems,2024
Optimized Routing Protocol Through Exploitation of Trajectory Knowledge for UAV Swarms,"Due to its strong flexibility and easy deployment, unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) swarm has been widely used in emergency communication, especially in the case when terrestrial infrastructures are no longer available. Within a UAV swarm, the design of routing protocol is one of the most challenging problems that enables cooperation among multiple UAVs to perform complex tasks in disaster areas. Nevertheless, the routing protocols reported so far have made the simplifying assumption that UAVs move randomly. In the context of mission-oriented scenarios, such as emergency communication in disaster areas, this assumption appears evidently impractical. On the contrary, for many UAV applications, the trajectories of UAVs are pre-planned. Disregarding trajectory information may result in routing protocols struggling to adapt to rapid changes in network topology. To break the bottleneck, we propose an efficient trajectory-based optimized routing protocol (TORP) for mission-oriented UAV swarm. Firstly, we model the packet routing problem using the concept of time-dependent graph. The objective is to maximize network performance, considering the power consumption and end-to-end (E2E) delay. The formulated problem is a binary linear programming (BLP) problem which is intractable to solve. Firstly, we propose a modified dynamically weighted Dijkstra's algorithm (MDWD). Based on the MDWD algorithm, we further propose an efficient optimization scheme to solve the problem. The simulation results demonstrate that our algorithm can make effective routing selections in dynamic UAV network, thereby improving the system performance in terms of packet delivery ratio, E2E delay and power consumption. © 2024 IEEE.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85194838896&doi=10.1109%2fTVT.2024.3405733&partnerID=40&md5=fce695a9e71d958f4e6c31bafbcad1ea,IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology,2024
Stability and Safety Analysis of Connected and Automated Vehicle Platoon Considering Dynamic Communication Topology,"Connected and automated vehicles (CAVs) can communicate with other CAVs through vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) communication technology which can improve the stability and safety performance of the platoon. However, the V2V communication could be unreliable as some factors such as hardware damage, packet loss, and cyber-attack, may lead to communication delay or failure. Considering that the communication topology of the platoon can vary dynamically due to these factors, it may result in instability and collision risk on the platoon. To mitigate the impact of communication delay or failure, the study introduces a dynamic weights optimization-based CAV following model (DWOC). It adopts the multi-predecessor following (MPF) mode with which vehicles can obtain the dynamic information of three predecessors and the corresponding information weights can be adjusted adaptively. The study formulates the string stability conditions of the model and validates the stability and safety impact on the platoon through a series of numerical experiments. The results indicate that DWOC can effectively improve the stability and safety performance under different communication delays. The findings suggest that the CAV manufacturers should account for the possible changes of the communication topology of the platoon. The proposed DWOC can serve as a reference in designing the CAV controller to ensure stability and improve safety of the platoon in reality under different communication delays.  © 2024 IEEE.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85194033587&doi=10.1109%2fTITS.2024.3398111&partnerID=40&md5=ade79ee28883cd36bbfbcf9b81974316,IEEE Transactions on Intelligent Transportation Systems,2024
Robust Beamforming and Phase Shift Optimization for RIS-Assisted UAV Multiuser MISO Communication Networks,"Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) are emerging as promising platforms to provide flexible and low-cost services for ground users of hard-to-reach areas in the era of 6G. Nevertheless, the limited battery life of UAVs poses a significant challenge when it comes to establishing reliable air-ground connections. A potential solution to address this challenge is to exploit reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (RIS), wherein RIS planes are affixed on UAVs to enhance energy efficiency. However, this scheme is subject to unwanted UAV oscillations. This paper presents a robust optimization framework for RIS-assisted UAV multiuser multiple-input single-output (MISO) communication networks while considering the practical undesired oscillations for UAV. Specifically, we formulate a weighted sum rate (WSR) maximization problem by jointly optimizing the transmit beamforming of the base station (BS) and the phase shift of RIS under UAV's undesired oscillations. To effectively tackle the intricate non-convex nature of the problem, we propose a robust block coordinate Lagrangian dual transform (RoBl) scheme by leveraging the block coordinate descent (BCD) and Lagrangian dual transform. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed scheme can achieve a superior WSR compared to the state-of-the-art benchmarks, and confirm the effectiveness and robustness of our proposed scheme.  © 2024 IEEE.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85192697053&doi=10.1109%2fTVT.2024.3398788&partnerID=40&md5=ad29b6bcf8b7d47a1235da69f8b12c20,IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology,2024
Caching on the Sky: A Multiagent Federated Reinforcement Learning Approach for UAV-Assisted Edge Caching,"As a promising solution to alleviate network congestion, mobile edge caching based on unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) has emerged and received intensive research interests, where users could download their desired contents from UAVs with much lower latency. As for the UAV-assisted edge caching, to improve the users' Quality of Experience while reducing the cost on content updating, how to jointly design the trajectory and caching strategy for UAVs is critical. However, considering the dynamics and uncertainty on the traffic environment, as well as the mutual effect among different UAVs, such joint design is nontrivial. In this article, we propose a collaborative joint trajectory and caching scheme for UAV-assisted networks under the dynamic and uncertain traffic environment. Unlike most existing work relying on model-based or single-agent methods, we develop a multiagent deep reinforcement learning (MADRL) approach to obtain the solution, where the specific content demand model is not needed and each UAV would learn the best decision autonomously based on its local observations. It can achieve the adaptive cooperation among different UAVs, while optimizing the overall network performance. Moreover, standing from the perspective on swarm intelligence, we further develop a dynamic clustering federated learning framework on the MADRL algorithm. By performing parameter fusion, each UAV can improve the learning efficiency.  © 2014 IEEE.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85193247249&doi=10.1109%2fJIOT.2024.3401219&partnerID=40&md5=3b297fc8cc87b286e6c018725babb09f,IEEE Internet of Things Journal,2024
FLASH-and-Prune: Federated Learning for Automated Selection of High-Band mmWave Sectors using Model Pruning,"Fast sector-steering in the mmWave band for vehicular mobility scenarios is a challenge because standard-defined exhaustive search over predefined antenna sectors cannot be assuredly completed within short contact times. This paper proposes machine learning to speed up sector selection using data from multiple non-RF sensors, such as LiDAR, GPS, and camera images in the mmWave radios with large codebooks. The contributions in this paper are threefold: First, we propose a multimodal deep learning architecture that fuses the inputs from these data sources and locally predicts the sectors for best alignment at a vehicle. Second, we propose FLASH-and-Prune, which combines the knowledge from multiple vehicles by aggregating the local model parameters and exploits model pruning to optimize the model parameter exchange overhead. Third, we present a pruning strategy that takes into account the distributed nature of federated learning to adaptively prune or retrieve model weights. We validate the proposed architecture on a real-world multimodal dataset collected from an autonomous car. We observe that FLASH-and-Prune incurs 29.25% and 35.89% less overhead in the uplink and downlink, respectively, compared to standard federated learning. © 2002-2012 IEEE.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85193274860&doi=10.1109%2fTMC.2024.3401046&partnerID=40&md5=b0c60e0f7da9e5f548780c74e3e533a7,IEEE Transactions on Mobile Computing,2024
An Automated Threat Intelligence Framework for Vehicle-Road Cooperation Systems,"Vehicle-road cooperation systems (VRCSs) use next-generation Internet technologies, including 5G, edge computing, and artificial intelligence to improve mobility, comfort, and travel efficiency. Internet of Vehicles (IoV) ecosystem serves as the technological backbone for VRCS by enabling seamless communication and data exchange between vehicles, infrastructure, and traffic management centers. This enables real-time, high-speed communication, efficient data processing, and enhanced security, fostering the development of autonomous driving, smart traffic management, and seamless connectivity within the VRCS ecosystem. At the same time, cyber attacks have become more complex, persistent, organized, and weaponized in IoV network. Threat intelligence (TI) has emerged as a prominent security approach to obtain a complete view of the dynamically growing cyber threat environment. On the other hand, modeling TI is a challenging task due to the limited labels available for different cyber threat sources. Second, most of the available designs require a large investment of resources and use handcrafted features, making the entire process error-prone and time-consuming. To tackle these challenges, this article presents TIMIF, a deep-learning-based TI modeling and identification framework for intelligent IoV and is based on three key modules: first, the proposed TIMIF adopts an automated pattern extractor (APE) module to extract hidden patterns from IoV networks. Employing its output, we design a TI-based detection (TIBD) module to detect abnormal behavior and TI-attack type identification (TIATI) module to identify attack types. Extensive experiments are carried out on three different publicly intrusion data sources, namely, HCRL-car hacking, ToN-IoT, and CICIDS-2017 to illustrate the utility of the TIMIF framework over some commonly used baselines and state-of-the-art techniques. © 2014 IEEE.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85192999647&doi=10.1109%2fJIOT.2024.3397652&partnerID=40&md5=1aed672e491fc6306b590539aa21f6c5,IEEE Internet of Things Journal,2024
Transmission Line Component Defect Detection Based on UAV Patrol Images: A Self-Supervised HC-ViT Method,"The unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) patrol inspection has become an efficient method to ensure the operation condition of transmission lines. The detection of key components with defects in transmission lines is a critical task in maintaining a power system's stability. However, the complex inspection environment and the imbalance between the number of normal component samples and that of defect samples significantly affect the detection accuracy. In this article, we present a novel method for defect detection in UAV patrol images, based on a hierarchical convolutional vision transformer (HC-ViT) and a simple contrastive masked autoencoder (SC-MAE). The HC-ViT backbone integrates the advantages of vision transformer and convolution, while the SC-MAE is a self-supervised learning method that extracts useful features from normal samples. By introducing the normal features into the backbone, we enhance the performance of the defect detection task. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our method through experiments, and show that it can leverage a large amount of unlabeled normal images, reducing the need for manual annotation. Our method offers a new way to exploit the potential features of patrol inspection images.  © 2024 IEEE.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85192200443&doi=10.1109%2fTSMC.2024.3386873&partnerID=40&md5=6a7f434b7941677966097b618a130d4f,"IEEE Transactions on Systems, Man, and Cybernetics: Systems",2024
Security-Enhanced Data Sharing Scheme With Location Privacy Preservation for Internet of Vehicles,"Data sharing plays an important role in assisting traffic management centers to obtain traffic operation status and make accurate traffic decisions. However, there are still many security problems associated with data sharing, such as privacy breaches. To address these problems, we propose a security-enhanced data sharing scheme with location privacy preservation for Internet of Vehicles, called SEDS. Specifically, the scheme first exploits an autonomous and controllable dynamic pseudonym mechanism to protect the privacy of vehicles' location, thereby preventing the leakage of vehicle trajectory information. Secondly, SEDS utilizes homomorphic encryption to aggregate data at the edge of the network to achieve privacy protection of data content. Thirdly, SEDS uses batch verification with privacy protection to achieve integrity and authenticity of data, and can effectively filter false data. Finally, SEDS applies blockchain technology to store shared data, which can guarantee the immutability of shared data. The security proof and analysis show that SEDS has security features, containing confidentiality, location privacy, authentication and data integrity, filtering false data and immutability. Experimental results exhibit that the SEDS is superior to other recently proposed schemes in terms of computational and communication overhead, as well as network performance. © 1967-2012 IEEE.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85192743880&doi=10.1109%2fTVT.2024.3393302&partnerID=40&md5=07c1b1519bca25c958a08efca913efb8,IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology,2024
UAV-Assisted Active Sparse Crowdsensing for Ground Signal Map Construction Based on 3-D Spatial-Temporal Correlation,"Mobile crowdsensing (MCS) has been applied for signal map construction in smart city. MCS leverages the mobility of users and the sensors embedded in mobile phones to collect and transfer sensing data. However, it is still costly for MCS to cover large-scale regions. Accordingly, data recovery algorithms are proposed, which allow participants to collect only few signal data and infer the remainder by leveraging spatialtemporal correlation of signals. However, existing work only considered the temporal and 2-D spatial correlation in the plane, while the altitude dimension is not exploited. In this article, we give an attempt to exploit the 3-D spatialtemporal correlation of signals to infer missing data and reconstruct ground signal map, where unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) can be used to collect signals from the air. Two UAV-assisted ground signal map construction schemes are proposed based on the propagation loss (PL) and convolution neural network (CNN). To further reduce the number of aerial samples required and reduce the cost incurred by UAV, a random-active sampling strategy is proposed to select more valuable signals in our work. Extensive simulations are performed which show that the proposed framework and schemes perform well under extremely high missing rate situations and outperform pure ground-based data recovery schemes. In addition, experiments for both indoor and outdoor are conducted to further verify the effectiveness of the proposed schemes.  © 2014 IEEE.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85193549558&doi=10.1109%2fJIOT.2024.3399409&partnerID=40&md5=4e862778aa729abbf140ba5943a00e15,IEEE Internet of Things Journal,2024
Covert Communication in Large-Scale Multi-Tier LEO Satellite Networks,"We leverage covert communication to enhance the security of a large-scale multi-tier Low Earth Orbit (LEO) satellite network against vigilant adversarial terrestrial Base Stations (BSs) aiming at detecting satellite transmissions. This approach involves deploying massive LEO satellites at different altitudes around Earth to form a multi-tier network serving as a backhaul for near-ground Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) that provide network services to terrestrial mobile users. Meanwhile, terrestrial BSs attempt to detect satellite transmissions based on their own received signal powers. To evade detection, the LEO satellite network performs power control to obscure the satellite transmission within the co-channel interference among the LEO satellites. We formulate a two-stage Stackelberg game to model the conflict dynamics between the terrestrial BSs and the LEO satellite network. In this game, the terrestrial BSs act as non-cooperative followers at the lower stage aiming to minimize their detection errors. On the other hand, the LEO satellite network acts as the leader at the upper stage aiming to maximize its utility while ensuring communication covertness. In contrast to existing works that focus on a small set of network nodes, our study considers a large-scale multi-tier LEO satellite network and employs stochastic geometry to model the spatial distribution of network nodes. To achieve the Stackelberg equilibrium, we develop a bi-level algorithm based on Successive Convex Approximation (SCA) and golden-section search. Our numerical results provide practical insights, revealing a trade-off in leveraging co-channel interference (i.e., while it improves the communication covertness of satellite transmission, it simultaneously degrades the link reliability). © 2002-2012 IEEE.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85192998506&doi=10.1109%2fTMC.2024.3396793&partnerID=40&md5=9a28d587523a0ae13a3a10cb9357e97a,IEEE Transactions on Mobile Computing,2024
Resilient Prediction-Based and Event-Triggered Control for CPSs under DoS Attacks,"This article studies the input-to-state stability (ISS) problem of cyber-physical systems (CPSs) subject to unknown disturbance and malicious denial-of-service (DoS) attacks. A resilient event-triggering mechanism is first proposed to reduce unnecessary network resource consumption. Then, a novel predictive control protocol is put forward to skillfully compensate for lost signals of CPSs during the case of DoS attacks. It is shown that the resulting closed-loop CPSs can achieve ISS under the proposed control update protocol. One of the key advantages of our proposed control protocol is that the missing information can be compensated, and the CPSs thus, can tolerate more unfavorable DoS attacks. Moreover, an intuitive minimum interevent time is provided so as to exclude the Zeno execution of control signals. Finally, a simulation example on unmanned ground vehicle is presented to verify the effectiveness of the proposed control protocols.  © 2005-2012 IEEE.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85192691203&doi=10.1109%2fTII.2024.3396298&partnerID=40&md5=b16dba8144ac52b213615da0208557d1,IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics,2024
Adaptive Cruise Control Utilizing Noisy Multi-Leader Measurements: A Learning-Based Approach,"A substantial number of vehicles nowadays are equipped with adaptive cruise control (ACC), which adjusts the vehicle speed automatically. However, experiments have found that commercial ACC systems which only detect the direct leader amplify the propagating disturbances in the platoon. This can cause severe traffic congestion when the number of ACC-equipped vehicles increases. Therefore, an ACC system which also considers the second leader further downstream is required. Such a system enables the vehicle to achieve multi-anticipation and hence ensure better platoon stability. Nevertheless, measurements collected from the second leader may be comparatively inaccurate given the limitations of current state-of-the-art sensor technology. This study adopts deep reinforcement learning to develop ACC controllers that besides the input from the first leader exploits the additional information obtained from the second leader, albeit noisy. The simulation experiment demonstrates that even under the influence of noisy measurements, the multi-leader ACC platoon shows smaller disturbance and jerk amplitudes than the one-leader ACC platoon, indicating improved string stability and ride comfort. Practical takeaways are twofold: first, the proposed method can be used to further develop multi-leader ACC systems. Second, even noisy data from the second leader can help stabilize traffic, which makes such systems viable in practice.  ©2024 The Authors.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85192216560&doi=10.1109%2fOJITS.2024.3395149&partnerID=40&md5=07f75e5313440e39c51b031860c8317d,IEEE Open Journal of Intelligent Transportation Systems,2024
Multi-AUV Collaboration-Assisted Location Privacy Protection Scheme in Unknown Marine Environments,"With the increase in the status of the ocean, the development of ocean resources is a priority, as is ocean security. Ocean security contains several aspects, such as equipment security, data security, military security, and so on. Location privacy protection of ocean equipment during data collection missions in unknown environments is investigated and a multiple autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs) collaboration-assisted location privacy-preserving scheme is proposed in this thesis. In an unknown environment, several AUVs gather together to form a swarm to perform regional detection and defense missions. The swarm may face potential active and passive attacks, and the leader AUV is in the priority of protection. In this case, the follower AUVs deploy nodes in an unknown environment to make a rough sense. Then, the nodes build a Voronoi diagram based on their own perceptions to form a graph. Based on this graph, the AUV divides the nodes into regions by density-based spatial clustering of applications with noise (DBSCAN) and uses rapidly exploring random trees (RRT) to plan the path in an unknown environment. Finally, the fake data along with the randomness of the moving follower AUV contribute to the location privacy-preserving during the regional detection and defense mission. Compared with the previous two schemes, the simulation results of the proposed method show some advantages in certain metrics.  © 2014 IEEE.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85192987185&doi=10.1109%2fJIOT.2024.3397858&partnerID=40&md5=cfe06438bb1ddb2ba05b930e211af056,IEEE Internet of Things Journal,2024
Optimal Transmit Power and Hovering Location for UAV Covert Communication in IoT Systems,"Internet of Things (IoT) play a paramount role in every aspect of our daily lives. Due to more diverse human needs, the future IoT networks are expected to be highly dynamic and heterogeneous with assistance of mobile nodes, such as unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs). However, the broadcast and openness nature of wireless communication and high-mobile characteristic of UAV can cause security threats to UAV-assisted IoT systems. For this sake, we consider exploiting covert communication to provide such a system with a higher level communication security, which can prevent the legitimate transmission being detected by the adversary monitor. Specifically, this article jointly optimizes the transmit power and hovering location of the UAV to guarantee communication security in the IoT system. We maximize the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of the legitimate receiver in presence of a malicious warden, with constraints of communication covertness, the UAV's spatial location and maximum transmit power. Particularly, the UAV's location is represented in terms of angles, rather than the commonly used distance, in most of the literature. The optimal location is determined in two steps. The simulation results show that the proposed optimization schemes can effectively find the optimal hovering location and transmit power of the UAV to maximize the receiver's SNR under the covertness constraint. The optimal hovering location is directly above the line connecting the legitimate receiver and the warden, and in close proximity within the small region directly above the receiver, which has implications for other analogous research scenarios or practical applications of UAV. © 2014 IEEE.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85192208812&doi=10.1109%2fJIOT.2024.3394593&partnerID=40&md5=90c8dfdc41defdf74e4ad4330e0dac41,IEEE Internet of Things Journal,2024
CCID-CAN: Cross-Chain Intrusion Detection on CAN Bus for Autonomous Vehicles,"Autonomous vehicles (AVs) rely on controller area network (CAN), which ensures the communication between massive electronic control units (ECUs) and passenger safety. Although CAN is a lightweight and reliable broadcast protocol, its vulnerability has caused CAN to confront serious security threats. Adversaries and malicious organizations can impair CAN bus in a variety of ways, such as injecting malicious messages into CAN bus. These malicious messages can directly intervene the functions inside AVs. Therefore, this article proposes a novel cross-chain-based intrusion detection for CAN bus (CCID-CAN) model that uses rule-based valid bit index (VBIN) model for initial intrusion detection on CAN bus inside AVs, followed by the Kalman filter and Naïve Bayes model for detecting attacks missed in the VBIN, where a cross-chain mechanism implements the exchange of attack logs among connected AVs that may not trust each other so as to optimize the Naïve Bayes detector. Afterwards, a series of experiments against several types of attacks are conducted on real vehicle supported by XPeng, and the results reveal that the CCID-CAN model outperforms existing models in terms of detection performance, time overhead, and memory footprint. In addition, attack log exchange for cross-chain networks in this proposed model is of high performance in latency, memory footprint, and throughput. © 2014 IEEE.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85191304512&doi=10.1109%2fJIOT.2024.3393122&partnerID=40&md5=9decf5900bf29c2a5f456534585b9daa,IEEE Internet of Things Journal,2024

Toward Intelligent Lightweight and Efficient UAV Identification With RF Fingerprinting,"The inherent flexibility of small unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) enables their deployment across various emerging markets. Unauthenticated UAVs pose a significant threat if they intrude into aviation-sensitive areas. To address this issue, deep learning (DL)-based radio frequency fingerprint identification (RFFI) has been developed as a promising approach for identifying illegal UAVs. However, these commonly used DL-based methods demand high computation and storage requirements, which are not suitable for the deployment of RFFI. In this article, we propose an efficient and low-complexity RFFI method for UAV identification. Specifically, we design a lightweight backbone network consisting of lightweight multiscale convolution (LMSC) blocks that can significantly reduce the model size and enhance the feature extraction ability. The simulation results indicate that our proposed UAV RFFI method outperforms other state-of-the-art and popular DL-based RFFI methods in terms of both identification performance and complexity. The identification accuracy surpasses that of all other methods at low signal-to-noise ratios (SNRs) and achieves nearly 100% accuracy at high SNRs. To further enhance model efficiency, we employ data truncation in our experimental simulations, demonstrating that a sample length of 2000 is sufficient to retain high identification performance. Additionally, we incorporate the Mixup regularization strategy, which improves accuracy without increasing the complexity, especially as sample length decreases. © 2014 IEEE.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85192138666&doi=10.1109%2fJIOT.2024.3395466&partnerID=40&md5=e49086c6a0c2f672f82c1a0d9e40bb0e,IEEE Internet of Things Journal,2024
Design of Intelligent Control Under Machine Learning Supervision and Signal Compression Mechanism Design for NCSs Under DoS Attacks,"This short paper addresses the challenge of network congestion in T-S fuzzy networked control systems (NCSs) caused by denial of service (DoS) attacks and quality of service (QoS) queuing mechanisms. Firstly, a novel signal compression mechanism is introduced to mitigate network congestion. The trigger threshold is optimized using a mini-batch descent gradient algorithm, effectively reducing bandwidth utilization. Furthermore, tailored Lyapunov-Krasovskii functions (LKFs) are established for the system, and we propose an intelligent event-triggered controller (IETC) under machine learning supervision.

Offloading of Tasks With Tight Delay Requirements via Combined Half and Full Duplex UAV Relays,"In this paper, we focus on offloading of computationally demanding tasks with tight processing delay requirements (hundreds of ms) from user equipments (UEs) to multi-access edge computing servers while exploiting unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) as relays. Traditionally addressed problem jointly optimizing an offloading decision and an association of the UEs to the UAVs is, in our work, enriched by optimization of the relaying via UAVs through selection between half-duplex (HD) and full-duplex (FD) under a constraint on the maximum processing delay of individual tasks. To solve this complex problem, we also optimize the length of relaying time slots in HD and the transmission power allocation for the UEs and the UAVs in FD. Then, we transform the problem to one-to-many matching and propose a low-complexity greedy algorithm for the joint offloading decision and UEs association solved together with the duplex selection. We show that our proposal reduces the sum energy consumed by the UEs and UAVs for the tasks offloading by up to 40% compared to related works.  © 1967-2012 IEEE.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85191811470&doi=10.1109%2fTVT.2024.3393552&partnerID=40&md5=ef86decdbab55264663c9e1a862a7b43,IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology,2024
Multichain-Assisted Lightweight Security for Code Mutated False Data Injection Attacks in Connected Autonomous Vehicles,"Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITSs) comprise a whole infrastructure of conventional vehicles, Connected Autonomous Vehicles (CAVs), roadside units, and communication equipment. As a result, a variety of smart sensors, cloud, and edge services are used. Due to the Vehicle-to-Everything (V2X) communication involved in these, the infrastructure becomes prone to security attacks. The most common of these is False Data Injection Attack (FDIA), which causes serious consequences upon driving decisions of a CAV. Blockchain is an ascending technology to provide proficient data security solutions; however, its implementation in securing CAV data is restricted due to its parallel reliance on cloud services. Furthermore, a standalone blockchain is prone to transaction verification delay and reduced transaction throughput, which is intolerable in the fast-paced CAV communication. This paper presents a novel framework enabling multichain, an open-source blockchain platform. Components of the proposed framework include multiple blockchains running on CAVs. The hashing algorithm operates on their Basic Safety Messages (BSMs), inputted to it as blockchain transactions. Our findings reveal that this multichain framework eliminates reliance on cloud services by devising a fully decentralized security solution against stealthy FDIAs that jeopardize a CAV's lane-changing. It provides an economy-building point for the CAV-metaverse by incentivizing the participating CAVs. Further, it manages transactions by employing multiple parallel blockchains for enhanced throughput. CAVs perform these security checks in as low as a few milliseconds compared to the existing centralized and computationally intensive frameworks.  © 2000-2011 IEEE.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85190749954&doi=10.1109%2fTITS.2024.3382313&partnerID=40&md5=2ed9dcf886c10546f1c1cf9b8d58df2d,IEEE Transactions on Intelligent Transportation Systems,2024
VADGAN: An Unsupervised GAN Framework for Enhanced Anomaly Detection in Connected and Autonomous Vehicles,"The utilization of Connected and Autonomous Vehicles (CAVs) is on the rise, driven by their ability to provide vehicular services such as enhancing vehicle safety, aiding in intelligent decision-making, and ensuring continuous operation. CAVs achieve their objectives by employing wireless Vehicle-to-Everything (V2X) communication within Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS) to establish connections with vehicles within the same network and roadside units. However, it has been observed that certain vehicles violate network constraints by transmitting erroneous messages, resulting in abnormal behaviour. Consequently, there is a growing need for a system that can verify the accuracy of information broadcast by each vehicle regarding its vehicle coordinates (along with relevant data depending on the application) at designated frequencies and under authorized pseudo-identities. Addressing the limitations faced by prior generative AI model applications, such as Variational Autoencoders (VAEs), this paper presents an unsupervised anomaly detection framework using Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) optimized for CAVs. Our framework tested across LSTM, RNN, and GRU architectures shows superior performance with LSTM, focusing on vehicle dynamics-position, speed, acceleration, and heading-to effectively identify 11 specific attack types, marking a significant advancement in anomaly detection for CAVs. © 1967-2012 IEEE.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85190746685&doi=10.1109%2fTVT.2024.3388591&partnerID=40&md5=7059d271f2a697ebfb5a1b98f7e96502,IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology,2024
USV Fleet-Assisted Collaborative Data Backup in Marine Internet of Things,"With the rapid development of artificial intelligence technology, unmanned surface vehicles (USVs) in marine Internet of Things (MIoTs) have become an important paradigm for marine environment exploration. However, in MIoTs, when collecting environmental information, USVs face a series of threats, such as engine failure, grounding, collision, etc., resulting in damage to shipboard memory, vessel breakage and sinking, which may cause loss or damage of stored data. The USV fleet consisting of multiple USVs is recently advocated to enable collaborative communication and storage resource sharing. As such, in this article, the USV fleet-assisted data backup scheme for the damaged USVs is proposed to guarantee the availability of stored data. First, a data backup framework for USV fleets is designed, where the USVs are classified into high-risk USVs and low-risk USVs according to the damage risk probability of sailing. Within the USV fleet, high-risk USVs (i.e., requesters) back up data to low-risk USVs (i.e., assistants) during emergency times. Second, the coalition game based on cost sharing is utilized to incentivize individual USVs to form the optimal USV fleets by maximizing the expected revenues, where the cost sharing fashion effectively ensures the stability of the coalitions. Finally, the joint optimization problem of the requesters' allocating data decisions and the assistants' receiving data decisions is formulated to maximize the average amount of data backup. The predictor-corrector interior point method (PIPM) and Q-learning method are leveraged to derive the reasonable solution for the formulated problem, with achieving the optimal allocating data decision and receiving data decision. Extensive simulation results demonstrate that the proposed scheme outperforms the benchmark schemes in terms of individual expected revenue, participation degree and the average amount of data backup. © 2014 IEEE.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85190725623&doi=10.1109%2fJIOT.2024.3386606&partnerID=40&md5=4bac3522e517332e15e14d5411c7f2a2,IEEE Internet of Things Journal,2024
Resilient Coverage by Teams of Quadrotor UAVs: Theory and Experiments,"We address the problem of coverage of a given environment by a team of quadrotor unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) with limited sensing capabilities. The objective is to develop a control strategy for spreading the UAVs across the environment for monitoring purposes. We do not assume the availability of a central controller for UAV coordination, and the UAVs cooperate by exchanging information via a communication network. By considering possible cyberattacks acting on the UAV network, we propose a resilient distributed control scheme such that the UAVs locally compute their position set points to achieve an overall coverage configuration despite the malicious behaviors of some attacked UAVs. By relying on the Voronoi diagram-based coverage technique, we first address possible attack scenarios that can deteriorate a covering mission. Then, we consider a generalized Voronoi diagram-based coverage scheme that shows resilience against cyberattack scenarios. We also design an adaptive control strategy ensuring the convergence of the UAVs to a desired coverage configuration, whereas the UAV parameters (inertial matrix, drag coefficient, and so on) are not known. Mathematical analysis, simulation, and real-world experimental results show the effectiveness of the proposed distributed resilient control scheme.  © 1993-2012 IEEE.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85191801071&doi=10.1109%2fTCST.2024.3389350&partnerID=40&md5=5450d5c3279c944d9a03d0a1af1489a6,IEEE Transactions on Control Systems Technology,2024
Cyberattack Monitoring Architectures for Resilient Operation of Connected and Automated Vehicles,"The deployment of connected and automated vehicles (CAVs) may enhance operations and safety with little human feedback. Automation requires the use of communication and smart devices, thus introducing potential access points for adversaries. This paper develops a prototype real-time monitoring system for a vehicle to infrastructure (V2I) based CAV system that generates cyberattack data for CAV operations under realistic traffic conditions. The monitoring system detects any deviations from the normal operation of CAVs using a long-short term memory (LSTM) neural network proposed by the authors and reverts the system back to a safe state of operation using a set of countermeasures. The proposed algorithm was also compared to convolutional neural network (CNN) and other classical algorithms. The monitoring system detected three different emulated cyberattacks with high accuracy. The LSTM showed the highest accuracy of 98% and outperformed the other algorithms. Further, the performance of the monitoring systems was assessed in terms of the impact on traffic stream stability and safety. The results reveal that a fake basic safety message (BSM) attack on even a single CAV causes the traffic stream to become significantly unstable and increase safety risk without the monitoring system. The monitoring system, however, reverts the system to a safe state of operation and reduces the negative impacts of cyberattacks. The monitoring system improves flow stability by an average of 38% as quantified through acceleration variation and volatility. This is comparable to the base case without attacks. The findings have implications for the design of future resilient systems.  © 2024 The Authors.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85191353701&doi=10.1109%2fOJITS.2024.3391830&partnerID=40&md5=0ec1cf711de11e535290ab80cd4f26e4,IEEE Open Journal of Intelligent Transportation Systems,2024
Security Analysis for Autonomous Ground Vehicle under Stealthy Sensor Attacks,"Lateral stability is a remarkably critical metric for the autonomous ground vehicle (AGV), and its loss is probable to cause a fatal accident. Various vehicular sensors, which play a key role in the lateral stability system, are coordinated to monitor the AGV's driving states. However, sensor attacks will inevitably push the AGV's lateral stability system into a insecure situation. In this paper, therefore, we investigate the security and insecurity conditions of the AGV under sensor attacks. Firstly, the dynamics output control protocol and the anomaly detector are developed in the lateral stability system. Then, we analyze the stealthiness of sensor attacks from the given detector's viewpoint. To describe how much the AGV is influenced by sensor attacks, we propose an equivalence condition associated with state variations. Besides, it is shown that internal states of the dynamics lateral controller are immune to stealthy sensor attacks. Secondly, we give a necessary and sufficient condition about the insecurity of AGV, which also motivates us how to design parameters to ensure cyber-security. Finally, we give a simulation to demonstrate the feasibility of the presented methodology. Specifically, we design a self-generated stealthy attack sequence, in which this sequence does not involve utilizing the system data in real-time. © 1967-2012 IEEE.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85190749284&doi=10.1109%2fTVT.2024.3387737&partnerID=40&md5=9acd3ecaa426d0bb7193cf20194f0c1a,IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology,2024

Pedestrian Crossing Intention Prediction Based on Cross-Modal Transformer and Uncertainty-Aware Multi-Task Learning for Autonomous Driving,"Accurate prediction of whether pedestrians will cross the street is prevalently recognized as an indispensable function of autonomous driving systems, especially in urban environments. How to utilize the complementary information present in different types of data (or modalities) is one of the major challenges. This paper makes the first attempt to develop a cross-modal transformer-based crossing intention prediction model merely using bounding boxes and ego-vehicle speed as input features. The cross-modal transformer can leverage self-attention and cross-modal attention to mine the modality-specific and complementary correlation. A bottleneck feature fusion is presented to obtain the compressed feature representation. To facilitate the network training, we further put forward a novel uncertainty-aware multi-task learning method that jointly predicts the future bounding box as well as crossing action such that the commonalities and differences across two tasks can be exploited. To evaluate the proposed method, extensive comparative experiments and ablation studies are performed on two benchmark datasets. The results demonstrate that by only using the bounding box and ego-vehicle speed as input features, our model is on a par with other state-of-the-art approaches that rely on more inputs, and even achieves superior performance in most cases.

Adaptive Safety Distance for Collision Avoidance Based on a Full Braking Activation Parameter,"In this paper, we propose an adaptive safety distance that is adjusted along the uncertain braking duration of the object vehicle resulting in an improvement of driving comfort. In the real world, the object vehicle decelerates for uncertain duration, while the conventional strategies assume that the object vehicle decelerates until full stop. By imposing a constraint on the ego vehicle to stop simultaneously with the object vehicle, the driving comfort is enhanced by activating full braking (FB) only when it is necessary. To accomplish these, two concepts are proposed; effective collision avoidance (ECA) condition and full braking activation parameter (FBAP). ECA refers to a strategy in which the ego vehicle stops simultaneously with the object vehicle to account for its uncertain deceleration duration. FBAP is suggested to determine when to activate FB by adjusting the duration of partial braking (PB). Virtual experiments are conducted strictly with various scenarios to validate the performance of the proposed FBAP-based safety distance. The test results demonstrate that the suggested FBAP-based safety distance is applicable to a wide range of driving speeds, improving driving comfort and performing collision avoidance compared to conventional methods.  © 2024 IEEE.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85190763151&doi=10.1109%2fTITS.2024.3386165&partnerID=40&md5=818dab0c4eb9bb11ced9c50c45a4977f,IEEE Transactions on Intelligent Transportation Systems,2024
Intelligent Decision-Making Method for AUV Path Planning Against Ocean Current Disturbance via Reinforcement Learning,"With the development of society and the economy, low-carbon and low-energy means of exploiting marine resources are receiving increasing attention. Autonomous path planning is a fundamental capability for IoT autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV) to carry out ocean exploration tasks. Currently, the main issue lies in the numerous disturbances and uncertainties present in the marine environment during practical applications, which can significantly impact path planning, leading to high-energy consumption and carbon emissions. To address this challenge, this article presents a sustainable reinforcement learning algorithm for handling time-varying current disturbances to achieve low-carbon AUV path planning, which is delineated into three steps. First, a 3-D time-varying current environment is established as the environmental framework for reinforcement learning, and the dynamic model of the AUV is formulated. Second, to enhance training efficiency and reduce AUV's energy consumption, this article puts forth the ocean current disturbance rejection PPO (OCDRP) algorithm, which incorporates tidal current information to enhance the AUV's resilience to time-varying currents. Lastly, expectile regression methods are introduced to facilitate the algorithm's convergence. Experimental results confirm the efficacy of the proposed algorithm and its adaptability to time-varying currents, making it an efficient, adaptable, and low-carbon sustainable path planning approach.  © 2014 IEEE.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85189634872&doi=10.1109%2fJIOT.2024.3384476&partnerID=40&md5=c2fb3a5dc346bdc99c2079d132902918,IEEE Internet of Things Journal,2024
PHY-Layer Authentication Exploiting Channel Sparsity in MmWave MIMO UAV-Ground Systems,"This paper exploits the efficient channel modeling and channel sparsity to propose a novel Physical (PHY)-layer authentication framework for a Millimeter Wave (mmWave) Multiple-Input Multiple-Output (MIMO) Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV)-ground system. Inspired by the Image Processing theory, we first explore a new Laplace prior approach for the efficient modeling of angular-domain mmWave MIMO channels. With the help of the new channel model, we then reveal the channel sparsity in the concerned system exhibiting a nice spatial correlation property. By a joint use of channel sparsity correlation, efficient sparsity feature extraction with Expectation Maximization (EM)/Generalized Approximate Message Passing (GAMP) algorithms and hypothesis testing, we thus devise a new authentication framework for the concerned system.

Progressive Critical Region Transfer for Cross-Domain Visual Object Detection,"— Well-trained visual object detectors are generally confronted with a severe performance decline when deployed in a novel driving scenario due to the impact of domain shift. Despite excellent improvements in unsupervised domain adaptive object detection achieved by adversarial training, those approaches fail to capture the transfer core underlying the holistic scenes. To solve this problem, we propose a progressive critical region transfer framework for cross-domain visual object detection. Specifically, we exploit a potential foreground mining (PFM) module and a semantic-specific RoI aggregation (SRA) module to improve the robustness of the cross-domain detection framework. Upon the critical regions in the broad sense, the PFM module first highlights the foreground regions by reweighting the hierarchical feature maps in sequence, and then modifies location biases at the downstream position of the backbone network for more accurate upstream predictions. Deep into the critical regions in the narrow sense, the SRA module concentrates on establishing an appropriate matching between batch-wise RoIs and all semantic centers, and further strengthens the aggregation of cross-domain identical semantic with the complement of context references. Together these modules are obligated to transform the adaptation importance from the whole scope to the latent foreground areas, and afterward to the informative regions of interest along the detection pipeline. Experiments show that our progressive critical region transfer framework achieves a state-of-the-art performance in adverse weather, camera configuration, and complicated scene adaptation, which outperforms the baselines by 19.4%, 5.0%, and 6.1%, respectively. © 2024 IEEE.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85190168509&doi=10.1109%2fTITS.2024.3382841&partnerID=40&md5=86207ee2e37f8828c01cf4d49577ca84,IEEE Transactions on Intelligent Transportation Systems,2024
TrajPRed: Trajectory Prediction With Region-Based Relation Learning,"— Forecasting human trajectories in traffic scenes is critical for safety within mixed or fully autonomous systems. Human future trajectories are driven by two major stimuli, social interactions, and stochastic goals. Thus, reliable forecasting needs to capture these two stimuli. Edge-based relation modeling represents social interactions using pairwise correlations from precise individual states. Nevertheless, edge-based relations can be vulnerable under perturbations. To alleviate these issues, we propose a region-based relation learning paradigm that models social interactions via region-wise dynamics of joint states, i.e., the changes in the density of crowds. In particular, region-wise agent joint information is encoded within convolutional feature grids. Social relations are modeled by relating the temporal changes of local joint information from a global perspective. We show that region-based relations are less susceptible to perturbations. In order to account for the stochastic individual goals, we exploit a conditional variational autoencoder to realize multi-goal estimation and diverse future prediction. Specifically, we perform variational inference via the latent distribution, which is conditioned on the correlation between input states and associated target goals. Sampling from the latent distribution enables the framework to reliably capture the stochastic behavior in test data. We integrate multi-goal estimation and region-based relation learning to model the two stimuli, social interactions, and stochastic goals, in a prediction framework. We evaluate our framework on the ETH-UCY dataset and Stanford Drone Dataset (SDD). We show that diverse prediction benefits from region-based relation learning. The predicted intermediate location distributions better fit the ground truth when incorporating the relation module. Our framework outperforms the state-of-the-art models on SDD by 27.61%/18.20% of ADE/FDE metrics.

"Design, Field Evaluation, and Traffic Analysis of a Competitive Autonomous Driving Model in a Congested Environment","Recently, numerous studies have investigated cooperative traffic systems using the communication among vehicle-to-everything (V2X). Unfortunately, when multiple autonomous vehicles are deployed while exposed to communication failure, there might be a conflict of ideal conditions between various autonomous vehicles leading to adversarial situation on the roads. In South Korea, virtual and real-world urban autonomous multi-vehicle races were held in March and November of 2021, respectively. During the competition, multiple vehicles were involved simultaneously, which required maneuvers such as overtaking low-speed vehicles, negotiating intersections, and obeying traffic laws. In this study, we introduce a fully autonomous driving software stack to deploy a competitive driving model, which enabled us to win the urban autonomous multi-vehicle races. We evaluate module-based systems such as navigation, perception, and planning in real and virtual environments. Additionally, an analysis of traffic is performed after collecting multiple vehicle position data over communication to gain additional insight into a multi-agent autonomous driving scenario. Finally, we propose a method for analyzing traffic in order to compare the spatial distribution of multiple autonomous vehicles. We study the similarity distribution between each team's driving log data to determine the impact of competitive autonomous driving on the traffic environment.

Zero-X: A Blockchain-Enabled Open-Set Federated Learning Framework for Zero-Day Attack Detection in IoV,"The Internet ofVehicles (IoV) is a crucial technology for Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS) that integrates vehicles with the Internet and other entities. The emergence of 5G and the forthcoming 6G networks presents an enormous potential to transform the IoV by enabling ultra-reliable, low-latency, and high-bandwidth communications. Nevertheless, as connectivity expands, cybersecurity threats have become a significant concern. The issue has been further exacerbated by the rising number of zero-day (0-day) attacks, which can exploit unknown vulnerabilities and bypass existing Intrusion Detection Systems (IDSs). In this paper, we propose Zero-X, an innovative security framework that effectively detects both 0-day and N-day attacks. The framework achieves this by combining deep neural networks with Open-Set Recognition (OSR). Our approach introduces a novel scheme that uses blockchain technology to facilitate trusted and decentralized federated learning (FL) of the Zero-X framework. This scheme also prioritizes privacy preservation, enabling both CAVs and Security Operation Centers (SOCs) to contribute their unique knowledge while protecting the privacy of their sensitive data. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work to leverage OSR in combination with privacy-preserving FL to identify both 0-day and N-day attacks in the realm of IoV. The in-depth experiments on two recent network traffic datasets show that the proposed framework achieved a high detection rate while minimizing the false positive rate. Comparison with related work showed that the Zero-X framework outperforms existing solutions.  © 1967-2012 IEEE.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85190354655&doi=10.1109%2fTVT.2024.3385916&partnerID=40&md5=a2f92d507baaa62c938075e8e15e4a61,IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology,2024
Blockchain-Assisted Lightweight Authenticated Key Agreement Security Framework for Smart Vehicles-Enabled Intelligent Transportation System,"Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS) supported by smart vehicles have revolutionized modern transportation, offering a wide range of applications and services, such as electronic toll collection, collision avoidance alarms, real-time parking management, and traffic planning. However, the open communication channels among various entities, including smart vehicles, roadside infrastructure, and fleet management systems, introduce security and privacy vulnerabilities. To address these concerns, we propose a novel security framework, named blockchain-assisted lightweight authenticated key agreement security framework for smart vehicles-enabled ITS (BASF-ITS), which ensures data protection both during transit and while stored on cloud servers. BASF-ITS employs a combination of efficient cryptographic primitives, including hash functions, XOR operator, ASCON, elliptic curve cryptography, and physical unclonable functions (PUF), to design authenticated key agreement schemes. The inclusion of PUF significantly enhances the system's resistance to physical attacks, preventing tampering attempts. To ensure data integrity when stored on the cloud, our framework incorporates blockchain technology. By leveraging the immutability and decentralization of the blockchain, BASF-ITS effectively safeguards data at rest, providing an additional layer of security. We rigorously analyze the security of BASF-ITS and demonstrate its strong resistance against potential security ass aults, making it a robust and reliable solution for smart vehicle-enabled ITS. In a comparative analysis with contemporary competing schemes, BASF-ITS emerges as a promising approach, offering superior functionality traits, enhanced security features, and reduced computation, communication, and storage costs. Furthermore, we present a practical implementation of BASF-ITS using blockchain technology, showcasing the computational time versus the ""transactions per block""and the ""number of mined blocks"", confirming its efficiency and viability in real-world scenarios. Note to Practitioners-This article is motivated by designing an efficient, lightweight, and anonymous blockchain-enabled authenticated security framework that can fix the security and privacy concerns in insecure environments for ITS applications, such as automated road speed enforcement, collision avoidance alarm systems, and traffic planning and management, etc. Authenticated key agreement schemes are extensively used to secure communications in the ITS environment. However, the existing state-of-the-art schemes are not efficient in terms of performance, are not resilient against potential security attacks, and do not support anonymity, untraceability, and unlinkability. Therefore, we propose the authenticated security framework to secure communication among the participating entities in the ITS environment. It utilizes efficient cryptographic primitives, such as hash function, XOR-operator, ASCON, elliptic curve cryptography, and PUF. It is shown that the proposed framework can be deployed as a robust tool to address the ITS security problems efficiently. Moreover, the proposed framework is lightweight and efficient and can be easily deployed in various ITS applications and other resource-constrained environments. However, the participating entities, such as vehicles and roadside units, must be PUF-enabled to deploy the proposed framework.  © 2004-2012 IEEE.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85189621544&doi=10.1109%2fTASE.2024.3381068&partnerID=40&md5=92798b9c082fc60a3ae7c37057643e68,IEEE Transactions on Automation Science and Engineering,2024
Zak-Transform-Based Adaptive Interference Extraction Method for GNSS Interference Mitigation,"Unmanned aerial vehicles rely heavily on global navigation satellite systems (GNSSs) for positioning and navigation when performing tasks. At the same time, low-cost GNSS jammers can pose a severe threat to the use of GNSSs. Interference affects the work of GNSS receivers and even causes GNSS positioning to fail, thereby increasing the possibility of drone mission failure. Aiming at the current common chirp interference, this article proposes an interference mitigation method based on the Zak transform to mitigate the impact of interference on GNSS receivers. The proposed method takes advantage of the sparsity of the interfering signal at the Doppler shift axis of the delay-Doppler domain to obtain an estimation of the interference signal, which is then subtracted from the received GNSS signal to remove the interference. Simulation results show that the proposed method is more effective in mitigating interference than other methods reported in the literature.  © 1965-2011 IEEE.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85189783515&doi=10.1109%2fTAES.2024.3382674&partnerID=40&md5=8ab2fa7b7eebebff9b1a95da3cda55db,IEEE Transactions on Aerospace and Electronic Systems,2024
Real-Time In-Situ Passive Acoustic Array Beamforming From the AutoNaut Wave-Propelled Uncrewed Surface Vessel,"This article presents the first demonstration of beamforming, detection, and bearing estimation of an underwater acoustic source from an eight-element thin line hydrophone array towed behind the AutoNaut wave-propelled uncrewed surface vessel. This has been achieved in situ and in real time during an experimental sea trial off the coast of Plymouth, U.K. A controlled acoustic source was towed from a support vessel while emitting seven tonals with frequencies between 480-1630 Hz and source levels between 93-126 dB. This allowed the detection performance of the array to be assessed and demonstrated for an acoustic source with known bearing and range. In postprocessing, the shape of the array was estimated using a cubic spline model, exploiting measurements from pressure and three-axis compass sensors integrated at each end of the array. The beamforming was repeated using the estimated array shape to infer the hydrophone positions, which resulted in a median improvement of 0.38 dB and maximum of 5.8 dB in the MUSIC beamforming output, and a potential reduction in the left/right bearing estimation ambiguities. The outcomes of this work demonstrate that the AutoNaut is an effective platform for towed array passive acoustic monitoring.  © 2024 IEEE.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85190168410&doi=10.1109%2fJOE.2024.3365169&partnerID=40&md5=b62479912325c210bb97fb7389389115,IEEE Journal of Oceanic Engineering,2024
Public Transit for Special Events: Ridership Prediction and Train Scheduling,"Many special events, including sports games and concerts, often cause surges in demand and congestion for transit systems. Therefore, it is important for transit providers to understand their impact on disruptions, delays, and fare revenues. Ridership after large sporting events is distinct from many other ridership patterns due to the high density of ridership localized to a few nearby stations. This paper provides the following novel methodology for long-Term planning of large-event, post-game ridership by 1) predicting the total post-game ridership; 2) combining the total prediction with historical trends to forecast the passenger flow curve at nearby stations after the game; and 3) estimating the required train frequencies to serve these customers with minimal passengers left behind by each train. Additionally, this paper proposes a suite of data-driven techniques that together create a data-driven pipeline to exploit Automated Fare Collection (AFC) data for evaluating, anticipating, and managing the performance of transit systems. This paper includes a case study where the proposed pipeline is used to generate an adjusted train schedule for the post-game period and simulated with the rail ridership data from the Metropolitan Atlanta Rapid Transit Authority (MARTA). The simulation results highlight how the proposed schedules based on the estimated required post-game train frequencies could significantly improve post-game congestion and wait time. Furthermore, the results show that the long-Term post-game demand forecasts could be an effective tool for tactical planning decisions such as the number of additional trains and operators that are needed during post-game periods compared to the regularly scheduled timetables.  © 2000-2011 IEEE.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85189516855&doi=10.1109%2fTITS.2024.3373634&partnerID=40&md5=788de208377405e2f802d9d8f1a03db8,IEEE Transactions on Intelligent Transportation Systems,2024
Effects of Foreground Augmentations in Synthetic Training Data on the Use of UAVs for Weed Detection,"This study addresses the issue of black-grass, a herbicide-resistant weed that threatens wheat yields in Western Europe, through the use of high- resolution Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) and synthetic data augmentation in precision agriculture. We mitigate challenges such as the need for large labeled datasets and environmental variability by employing synthetic data augmentations in training a Mask R-CNN model. Using a minimal dataset of 43 black-grass and 12 wheat field images, we achieved a 37% increase in Area Under the Curve (AUC) over the non-augmented baseline, with scaling as the most effective augmentation. The best model attained a recall of 53% at a precision of 64%, offering a promising approach for future precision agriculture applications. © NLDL 2024.

Loop closure with a low power millimeter wave radar sensor using an autoencoder,"In this paper, we will consider place recognition, more commonly know as loop closure, with a low resolution single-chip millimeter wave (mmWave) radar in indoor environments. It is an essential part in simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM) systems to avoid drift. By using a novel method to create descriptors or latent codes with an autoencoder in combination with exploiting the temporal similarity between our latent codes, we are able to successfully extract loop closures with a radar-only system without requiring ground truth.

Adaptive SNDO-STSM Hierarchical Robust Control of Autonomous Underwater Vehicle: Theory and Experimental Validation,"This article mainly investigates the depth tracking problem for an underactuated autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV), considering system dynamic uncertainties and unknown external disturbances. First, a three-layer hierarchical control system is developed for the underactuated AUV, enhancing system flexibility and control performance. Second, an adaptive line-of-sight guidance law is presented, which estimates the attack angle and mitigates the influence of unknown disturbances on the guidance layer. Third, a finite-time control law based on second-order sliding-mode algorithm is proposed along with a modified sliding surface-based nonlinear observer for approximating complex uncertainties. This provides additional robustness to overcome intense transient impact. Furthermore, the sensitivity to precise modeling and the chattering phenomenon in actuators are relaxed. In addition, an adaptive saturation compensator is given to overcome the adverse effects caused by control input saturation constraints without singularities. Finally, the proposed hierarchical control system is validated in practice based on a lightweight AUV prototype. Comparative experiments are conducted under the influence of various types of complicated time-varying disturbances. The experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness and advantages of the proposed control system in practical scenarios.  © 2024 IEEE.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85189304562&doi=10.1109%2fTIE.2024.3376817&partnerID=40&md5=82e8a0caaa3b9155ea7271e763d169a5,IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics,2024
UAV-Assisted MEC System With Mobile Ground Terminals: DRL-Based Joint Terminal Scheduling and UAV 3D Trajectory Design,"In this paper, we investigate an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV)-assisted edge computing network in a sophisticated three-dimensional (3D) scenario, e.g., a post-disaster urban area with multiple mobile ground terminals (GTs) for resilience. The mission of the UAV is to first collect a set of computation tasks from multiple GT sources, then process them and make joint decisions (computation results) which are finally transmitted to another set of GT destinations. An efficient design is provided aiming at minimizing the total time cost including costs for the task offloading, computations, and decision transmissions, via jointly designing the UAV's trajectory and the scheduling of communications from and to different GTs. In particular, we take into account the practical assumptions on the GTs' mobility, on the obstacle avoidance to 3D buildings, and on that the UAV is possible to fly among buildings, i.e., the flying altitude can be lower than the buildings' heights. To address the established complex and non-convex problem, we first provide a problem transformation by exploiting Markov decision process (MDP), and then propose a deep reinforcement learning (DRL) approach-based solution with a multi-step dueling DDQN (D3QN) method. As a result, an efficient solution is achieved, where the UAV acts as the agent to continuously explore and improve its mobile strategy during interacting with the environment under the proposed method. The simulation results show the advantages of the proposed 3D trajectory design in comparison to a 2D one. In addition, the results confirm the robustness of the proposed design in terms of different GTs' mobility models and UAV flying height/area limits, and illustrate the superiority of unrestricted feasible domains for the UAV flight.  © 1967-2012 IEEE.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85189331309&doi=10.1109%2fTVT.2024.3367624&partnerID=40&md5=f6f86b984c616586cad2eb6306fc039e,IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology,2024
Distributed Cooperative Strategy of UAV Swarm Without Speed Measurement under Saturation Attack Mission,"In this article, a distributed cooperative strategy based on a saturation attack mission (SAM) with an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) swarm is investigated. Little research has been conducted in this area, especially in relation to aerial moving targets. First, the mathematical model of the UAV swarm and the problem of distributed fencing under SAM are established, respectively. Second, aimed at the target's defense system, a calculation model of assigned UAVs is designed to ensure that the minimum number of UAVs is required to carry out the mission. Then, considering one situation that the entire swarm is not loaded speed measurement and at least one UAV can detect the moving-target's position, a distributed cooperative control scheme without a preset formation is proposed. It includes a distributed position observer and a fencing controller, which inspired by swarm behaviors and consensus theory. Furthermore, the speed information of each UAV is replaced by introducing an auxiliary state. This controller realizes target-fencing without collision between UAVs. Finally, the effectiveness of the developed strategy is demonstrated through numerical simulations.  © 1965-2011 IEEE.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85190167617&doi=10.1109%2fTAES.2024.3382627&partnerID=40&md5=52dbd8a54e35339d689362c7ede9eddf,IEEE Transactions on Aerospace and Electronic Systems,2024
Unmanned Aerial Vehicle Aided Batteryless Covert Communications: A Robust Design Against Cooperative Hostile Detection,"An unmanned-aerial-vehicle (UAV) is exploited for securely collecting sensing data from massively deployed batteryless devices on the ground. Specifically, signals emitted by the UAV have the following functions: jamming hostile wardens (HWs) and powering legitimate devices (LDs). The transmit power of both the LDs and the UAV as well as the UAV's flying trajectory are jointly optimised for maximising the uplink throughput of data collection, while ensuring that the uplink transmissions of LDs to the UAV cannot be detected by HWs. The formulated optimisation problem is difficult to solve due to its non-convexity. Therefore, a successive convex approximation (SCA) based alternating optimisation (AO) is proposed for obtaining a near-optimal solution. In our design, the UAV does not need the exact locations of the HWs, while it is robust to the optimal cooperative detection among the HWs with a greedy scheduling (GS) based algorithm. The numerical results demonstrate that the uplink-throughput can be substantially improved by our joint design. © 2024 IEEE.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85190170502&doi=10.1109%2fTVT.2024.3384445&partnerID=40&md5=8c38000be87d50c1c01c44f895116a8e,IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology,2024
Cloth-Changing Person Re-Identification with Invariant Feature Parsing for UAVs Applications,"Recently, deep learning-based intelligent vehicle control systems have played an important role in real-time road conditions assessment applications. It relies primarily on unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) for specific target retrieval, especially Cloth-Changing Person Re-identification (CC-ReID) technology, to provide support for road observations and environmental monitoring. Existing CC-ReID methods mainly focus on the invariant features of the front and rear views that are independent of clothing; among them, global color enhancement is a commonly used strategy. However, this method usually reduces the chromatism between the target foreground and background, which can easily lead to the loss of features unrelated to clothing and reduce the model's performance. To solve this problem, this article proposes a data augmentation framework with Local Invariant Feature Transformation and Clothing Adversarial Parsing (LIFTCAP) for CC-ReID. The proposed framework is equipped with a Local Invariant Feature Transition (LIFT) module and a Clothes Adversarial Parsing (CAP) module. The former aims to extract invariant features for the same person with different clothes using the local transition manners. CAP is devoted to finding adversarial associations and parsing contour differences between clothing styles. Subsequently, a feature correlation strategy is alternately implemented between the two modules to complete the optimization procedure. Extensive experiments were conducted on the public CC-ReID datasets (LTCC and PRCC), demonstrating the superiority of our proposed method over the latest methods. Furthermore, our method achieved competitive performance, particularly on a surveillance video dataset (CCVID). In addition, based on the LIFTCAP strategy, the proposed algorithm can achieve a time efficiency as low as O(n) for detecting specific targets when deployed on a UAV server (Feisi X200) for real-time road conditions assessment and monitoring applications. © 1967-2012 IEEE.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85190342845&doi=10.1109%2fTVT.2024.3388249&partnerID=40&md5=bff6396140c5effd3cc518d871262ec1,IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology,2024
State Estimation Adaptable to Cyberattack Using a Hardware Programmable Bank of Kalman Filters,"Sensor-estimator systems provide critical information on the state of cyber-physical plants. Often, these units operate in an environment of constrained computational resources. This condition makes them vulnerable to cyberattacks that aim especially to degrade their processing capability and effectively incapacitate them. In the event that computational nodes are lost, an approach to adapt the estimator's algorithm and reprogram the adapted form on the surviving hardware is presented. To prepare the sensor-estimator system for degradation, the following co-design steps are developed: 1) the estimation algorithm, a bank of Kalman filters (KFs), is distributed so that multiple elemental filters are implemented on a collection of field-programmable gate arrays (FPGAs) and 2) the matrix operations of the conventional KF are programmed on the FPGAs using Faddeeva's elimination. After the attack, adaptation of the filter bank is realized by leveraging dynamic partial reconfiguration (DPR) of the surviving FPGAs. A high-authority agent monitors the likelihood of all elemental filters, a measure of which filters currently provide the best estimates, and replaces the least likely elements of the bank with the most likely ones. The latter are loaded onto the freed-up fabric of the remaining FPGAs, while these units are running other elemental filters in order to process sensor data without interruption. We have demonstrated their method on a prototype system that uses a radar sensor to estimate the kinematics of a maneuvering unmanned surface vehicle (USV).  © 1993-2012 IEEE.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85190170337&doi=10.1109%2fTCST.2024.3378991&partnerID=40&md5=9fd142f56eeddca07e3d4d1e5e15798e,IEEE Transactions on Control Systems Technology,2024
Time-Series Anomaly Detection in Automated Vehicles Using D-CNN-LSTM Autoencoder,"— It is reasonable to expect Connected and Automated Vehicles (CAVs) to revolutionize the intelligent world owing to the swapping of seamless and real-time data. Although CAVs provide many benefits to the environment and society, new challenges in term of security, privacy, and safety are emerged by anomalies, errors, cyber-security attacks, or malicious activities that led to accidents with fatal victims. This paper tackles the anomaly detection problem by introducing a novel framework in multisensor CAVs, which applies an efficient data preprocessing and deep learning method. In this paper, two preprocessing methods have been used and compared in the deep learning based models. The main contributions of this paper compared to previous works include two fundamental tasks. First, the quality of time series data is improved in the preprocessing phase by Differencing (DIFF) or Moving Standard Deviation (MSD). Second, the applied deep learning method is based on an autoencoder where a combination of Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) is utilized as the autoencoder architecture, which is referred to as D-CNN-LSTM Autoencoder in this paper. The D-CNN-LSTM Autoencoder method optimizes the anomaly detection rate for all of the anomalies, specifically in the case of low magnitude anomalies, enhancing F1-score up to 18.12% in single types of anomalies and 32.83% in mixed types of anomalies. The experimental results indicate the superiority of the proposed method for time series anomaly detection over the state-of-the-art and benchmark methods. © 2024 IEEE.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85189551719&doi=10.1109%2fTITS.2024.3380263&partnerID=40&md5=fe1188fd6590d7e75dcf2ebf9e4337dc,IEEE Transactions on Intelligent Transportation Systems,2024
Provably and Physically Secure UAV-Assisted Authentication Protocol for IoT Devices in Unattended Settings,"As the core subject of IoT applications, IoT devices have faced numerous security challenges. Especially for IoT devices deployed in remote or harsh environments, they are often unattended for long periods, making it difficult to share the sensing data and susceptible to potential physical attacks. While aerial assistance methods represented by unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) can solve the problem of data sharing at a low cost, it is necessary to establish a secure channel between ground control stations, UAVs, and IoT devices due to the sensitivity of the sensing data. Recently, Physical Unclonable Function (PUF) has been proven to provide unique identity identification for devices using its tamper-proof feature. In this paper, we propose a lightweight UAV-assisted authentication and key agreement protocol for unattended IoT devices, ensuring secure communication and physical tamper-proof requirements. However, our work does not stop there. We noticed that some existing PUF-based authentication schemes misunderstand the ability of PUF, which leads to these schemes cannot actually provide physical protection. We analyzed the security vulnerabilities of these schemes and proposed rules that should be followed when designing authentication protocols using PUF. In addition, for the first time, we put forward the formal definitions and proof methods for PUF in the formal proof of the security protocol, which avoided the unreasonable initial assumptions adopted in the proof of the existing schemes. We extended Mao-Boyd (MB) logic and comprehensively analyzed the proposed protocol. We also evaluate the performance of the proposed scheme, and the results show that the proposed scheme has certain advantages in communication and computation overhead compared with existing schemes.  © 2005-2012 IEEE.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85188916189&doi=10.1109%2fTIFS.2024.3379861&partnerID=40&md5=adc6e0e8a8a57c5e1eac92d2eb93ddfa,IEEE Transactions on Information Forensics and Security,2024
Secure and Safe Control of Connected and Automated Vehicles Against False Data Injection Attacks,"This paper studies the secure and safe control problem of connected and automated vehicles (CAVs) with false data injection (FDI) attacks. A secure and safe controller with a novel surrounding vehicles' state estimator and an attack detector is proposed. The state estimation for surrounding vehicles is collectively processed by combining the deep neural network-based predictions with model-based estimations. Additionally, a weight in the loss function is proposed for more accurate predictions of vehicles that are closer to the ego vehicle. For attack detection, a novel scheme that utilizes control outcomes to train detection actions is proposed. Different from the objectives of existing detectors, the reward for the proposed detector is designed to encourage the CAV to fully utilize the observations. A reward setting and the decision preference of the ego vehicle are theoretically analyzed. The effectiveness of the proposed algorithm is validated in an open simulation environment.  © 2024 IEEE.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85188455586&doi=10.1109%2fTITS.2024.3371072&partnerID=40&md5=1cdacf146805fe88eab9ba5fc29f8221,IEEE Transactions on Intelligent Transportation Systems,2024
PhaDe: Practical Phantom Spoofing Attack Detection for Autonomous Vehicles,"Despite their prevalence and indispensability in the perception modules of autonomous vehicles, cameras have shown susceptibility to numerous attacks. Among them, the phantom spoofing attack is of significant concern. In such attacks, malefactors employ electronic display devices like projectors and display monitors to generate deceptive objects, thereby duping the object detectors in autonomous vehicles. However, existing detection methodologies are narrowly focused on a single device category, ignoring the multitude of devices that could be leveraged for attacks. Furthermore, the artificial modality-based solution presently in use lacks efficacious fusion mechanisms. In response to these limitations, we propose PhaDe, a practical deep learning-based system adept at detecting phantom spoofing attacks from a variety of and even unfamiliar attack devices. Our approach introduces two image processing techniques to construct artificial modalities and further advances a multi-head self-attention MSA-based fusion module for more versatile integration of disparate modalities. To boost the generalization capacity of our system against novel, unseen attacks, we incorporate two representation-level losses to align feature distributions from various domains. Evaluations conducted on our own dataset, encompassing fake objects from several device types, attest to the efficacy of our system. Our results indicate an accuracy of 98.80% on familiar domains and a detection success rate of 94.03% on unfamiliar domains. Additionally, PhaDe demonstrates a swift response time, fulfilling the practicality requisites.  © 2005-2012 IEEE.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85187975192&doi=10.1109%2fTIFS.2024.3376192&partnerID=40&md5=636c884712a6d2031f450a162c91a2b3,IEEE Transactions on Information Forensics and Security,2024
Target Tracking with Circumnavigation Scheme Using Discrete Bearing and Control Input,"Exploiting proper controller and bearing-only measurement to perform the target tracking with unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) has become a popular trend due to the convenience of a single bearing sensor and the flexibility of UAVs. This article revisits the slowly moving target circumnavigation problem with UAV modeled as a first-order integrator, presenting results in three aspects. First, we focus on the problem with discrete bearing data and control input, illustrating the principle parameter conditions for system convergence. Second, a thorough convergence analysis from a different perspective for a typical algorithm is presented, resulting a more accurate conclusion upon the target-circumnavigation system convergence. Third, based on the estimation property, an algorithm that exploits the rough information of the target velocity is proposed, which significantly accelerates the estimation error convergence rate and improves the estimation performance. Simulation results are given that validate the conclusion that the estimation error and UAV distance can be unbounded when the target velocity is specially designed under common assumptions in the literature, which corrects the conclusion in the existing work, and also validates that the proposed algorithm possesses estimation performance obviously superior to that of existing algorithms, especially for situation with constant-velocity target.  © 1965-2011 IEEE.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85188420080&doi=10.1109%2fTAES.2024.3379491&partnerID=40&md5=41f6d8d4e1d316f06de62fe3127a5260,IEEE Transactions on Aerospace and Electronic Systems,2024
Graph Convolutional Flocking Control for Unmanned Aerial Vehicles With Packet Dropouts,"Flocking control of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) plays a vital role in numerous applications with its adaptability, decentralization, and self-organization. Despite advances, the control performance of present approaches will deteriorate in practical applications due to the disregard of the strong coupling of the complexity of the UAVs (e.g., nonlinearity and strong coupling), agent interaction, and network quality (e.g., time delay and packet dropouts). To address this problem, we propose a novel graph convolutional flocking strategy for nonlinear UAV systems in the event of stochastic packet dropouts over the communication network. Different from the existing methods that only rely on a nominal model, this article formulates the flocking control problem from the perspective of an underlying graph, and exploits the graph convolution to generate a contextualized representation of the spatiotemporal state-control space. A predictive model of packet dropouts is generated with the state-control sequences in the learned representation space. Consequently, a graph convolutional flocking controller including a packet dropout predictive compensation module is proposed. The stability of the closed-loop system is verified by Lyapunov theory. Simulation and physical-world experimental studies for flocking control of a multiquadcopter system are performed to verify the effectiveness of our proposed strategy. © 2024 IEEE.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85188506807&doi=10.1109%2fTIE.2024.3370972&partnerID=40&md5=57e20e09a70088f97e8125505e595833,IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics,2024
USAF-IoD: Ultralightweight and Secure Authenticated Key Agreement Framework for Internet of Drones Environment,"The use of Internet of Drones (IoD) technology has surged across various domains such as logistics, surveying, industrial inspections, emergency response, security, infrastructure monitoring, crop management, and more. However, real-time communication with drones or Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) in the IoD environment occurs over an insecure open channel, making it susceptible to various security and privacy vulnerabilities, including unauthorized access, data interception, denial of service attacks, and privacy concerns. Due to their unique characteristics, including long transmission distances, unstable communication environments, resource limitations, and the highly dynamic nature of UAVs, ensuring the security and privacy of IoD systems is of paramount importance for the success of IoD-based applications. Furthermore, drones are resource-constrained devices, and employing expensive security solutions is impractical, as it would significantly reduce the operational capacity of drones. In this paper, we present the design of an ultralightweight, secure, and robust user-authenticated key agreement framework for the IoD environment, named USAF-IoD. The proposed USAF-IoD is developed by incorporating authenticated encryption (ASCON), cryptographic hashing, XOR operations, and the use of physical unclonable functions (PUFs). PUFs are employed to enhance resistance against physical tampering attacks. The security analysis reveals that the proposed USAF-IoD meets the essential security requirements of the IoD environment. The comparative analysis further highlights the effectiveness of the proposed USAF-IoD, notably excelling in terms of security and functionality characteristics when compared to existing benchmark schemes, and showcasing competitive performance in computation, communication, and energy overheads.  © 1967-2012 IEEE.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85188009089&doi=10.1109%2fTVT.2024.3375758&partnerID=40&md5=994139cf49d163a1fb1135181b83a698,IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology,2024
Sonar Image Generation by MFA-CycleGAN for Boosting Underwater Object Detection of AUVs,"Acquiring large amounts of high-quality real sonar data for object detection of autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs) is challenging. Synthetic data can be an alternative, but it is hard to generate diverse data using traditional generative models when real data are limited. This study proposes a novel style transfer method, i.e., the multigranular feature alignment cycle-consistent generative adversarial network (CycleGAN), to generate sonar images leveraging remote sensing images, which can alleviate the dependence on real sonar data. Specifically, we add a spatial attention-based feature aggregation module to preserve unique features by attending to instance parts of an image. A pair of cross-domain discriminators are designed to guide generators to produce images that capture sonar styles. We also introduce a novel cycle consistency loss based on the discrete cosine transform of images, which better utilizes features that are evident in the frequency domain. Extensive experimental results show that the generated sonar images have better quality than CycleGAN, with improvements of 15.2% in IS, 56.9% in FID, 42.6% in KID, and 7.6% in learned perceptual image patch similarity, respectively.

Graph Matching-Based Spatiotemporal Calibration of Roadside Sensors in Cooperative Vehicle-Infrastructure Systems,"Sensors, such as cameras, millimeter-wave radar, and LiDAR, are widely deployed in cooperative vehicle-infrastructure systems. The demand for calibration of initial installation, damage replacements, and unstable installation has risen dramatically. Traditional methods require on-site operation and road closure; thus, repeated calibration can severely affect traffic conditions and expose operational personnel to potential safety threats. As more and more autonomous vehicles (AVs) flood the roads, this paper proposes an automatic calibration framework of roadside sensors by leveraging the high-precision positioning and perception data of AVs. First, we design a graph-based target-matching algorithm using an AV's surrounding traffic perception data to identify the AV of interest from a dataset of multiple target trajectories recorded by roadside sensors. A line search algorithm is then designed to adjust the clock delay between sensors and establish the temporal correspondence, where a Gaussian process is applied to estimate the vehicle state in continuous time. Finally, we develop a least squares optimization model to complete the final calibration with the AV positioning data. The influence of measurement noise and missed detections on the proposed calibration framework are analyzed in simulated scenarios based on a Next Generation SIMulation (NGSIM) dataset, and the practicability is validated based on real-world data collected at Donghai Bridge, Hangzhou Bay Bridge, and DAIR-V2X dataset. It is shown that the proposed target matching algorithm can identify an AV trajectory from roadside sensor data with 20%-90% higher accuracy than baseline models, and the framework can accurately estimate the spatial and temporal parameters even with poor data quality. The mean least squares error of the trajectory alignment reaches centimeter-level accuracy.  © 2024 IEEE.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85188516723&doi=10.1109%2fTITS.2024.3374281&partnerID=40&md5=b89bcb6298ed2c41b5f26b5eafc3ab1c,IEEE Transactions on Intelligent Transportation Systems,2024
Anti-Watermarking Stealthy Deception Attacks Against Networked Unmanned Surface Vehicles,"This paper investigates the problem of designing stealthy deception attacks against networked unmanned surface vehicles (USVs) equipped with watermarking detection modules. To overcome the limitations of the existing attack methods affected by watermarking technology, an anti-watermarking stealthy deception attack method is proposed, where two auxiliary estimators are designed to indirectly estimate the compromised system state such that the proposed attacks can deteriorate the performance of USVs without being detected by watermarking modules. Compared with the existing results, the proposed method exhibits better stealthiness. To improve the attack performance, an exponential deception signal model with adjustable parameters is designed, and its destructiveness is analyzed under different conditions. A simulation example is given to demonstrate the effectiveness and superiority of the proposed method.  © 2000-2011 IEEE.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85188950558&doi=10.1109%2fTITS.2024.3374971&partnerID=40&md5=8786a84ac7e23e3dc2df679343bfa80d,IEEE Transactions on Intelligent Transportation Systems,2024
"Joint Sensing, Communication, and Computation in UAV-Assisted Systems","This article proposes a joint sensing, communication, and computation (JSCC) framework in unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV)-assisted systems, where multifunctional terminal devices (TDs) can perform high-accuracy radar sensing as well as offload computation data to an airborne mobile-edge computing (MEC) server over the same frequency band. The key objective of the JSCC framework is to simultaneously minimize the transmitted sensing beampattern matching error whilst maximizing the minimum computation efficiency of TDs. This problem is formulated as a multiobjective optimization problem (MOOP) that jointly optimizes the transmit beampattern, computation offloading, and UAV trajectory. To achieve the computation-sensing tradeoff region, we first transform the MOOP into a single-objective optimization problem (SOOP) via the ϵ1-constraint method. To make it more tractable, a generalized Dinkelbach's and successive convex approximation (GD-SCA) algorithm is proposed. Specifically, GD-SCA transfers the nonconvex max-min fractional programming in the resultant SOOP by introducing a general auxiliary polynomial via generalized Dinkelbach's algorithm. Thereafter, the transmit beampattern, computation offloading, and UAV trajectory optimization are decoupled into two nested subproblems, which can be iteratively solved by invoking the successive convex approximation (SCA) method to handle the remaining nonconvex components. The proposed GD-SCA can obtain high-quality suboptimal solutions of the original MOOP. We validate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm by considering two multiple access techniques, i.e., nonorthogonal multiple access (NOMA) and space-division multiple access (SDMA). Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed algorithm can achieve an improved computation-sensing tradeoff region compared to conventional schemes especially when exploiting NOMA. Moreover, the multifunctional performance can be significantly improved while stringently guaranteeing both radar sensing and computation offloading requirements.  © 2024 IEEE.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85187400743&doi=10.1109%2fJIOT.2024.3362937&partnerID=40&md5=b5bf47772792c517891280e8aa08f143,IEEE Internet of Things Journal,2024
Designing Anonymous Key Agreement Scheme for Secure Vehicular Ad-Hoc Networks,"Presently, the Vehicular Ad-hoc Network (VANET) is very important for the entire traffic management system. The 5th Generation (5G) enables VANET and Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS) to connect devices in the million/sqkm range with improved performance, incredible transmission speed (terabit), and less cost to serve a vast, transformative, and diverse automobile sector. To ensure security and avoid the free flow of information in highly scalable, dynamic 5G, there are many challenges to restrict unauthenticated users access and proper key agreements with fine-grained access control. Here, a lightweight biometrics-based dynamic Anonymous Key Agreement Scheme (AKAS) with a fine-grained authentication feature is proposed to address challenges related to the restriction of unauthenticated users access and proper key agreement with fine-grained access control specifically for Vehicle-to-Vehicle (V2V) communication in VANET. In the proposed scheme, registered and authorized users can access services or information as per access privilege only. We have simulated our scheme using Automated Validation of Internet Security Protocols (AVISPA), Simulation of Urban MObility (SUMO), OMNET++ (Objective Modular Network Testbed in C++), and performed formal security analysis using the Real-or-Random (ROR) oracle model. Analysis and simulation results show that our scheme is secured against various well-known attacks. Further, we have compared the security and efficiency of our scheme with the existing schemes and found that our proposed protocol is more secure, lighter, 5G-friendly, scalable, and even faster than the other related schemes.  © 2024 IEEE.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85188522068&doi=10.1109%2fTITS.2024.3373253&partnerID=40&md5=19a227c8a7f36e122751ef110a0db016,IEEE Transactions on Intelligent Transportation Systems,2024

Anti-Jamming Colonel Blotto Game for Underwater Acoustic Backscatter Communication,"Underwater acoustic backscatter communication, which allows an underwater sensor node (USN) to communicate with the surface sink node (SN) by reflecting the acoustic signal from the SN, is a promising solution for enabling the Internet of Underwater Things. However, underwater backscattering is vulnerable to jamming attacks, especially from a gliding autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV) that can inject jamming signal to the underwater acoustic channel accordingly. This article considers the attack-defense interactions between the AUV jammer and the SN defender in their transmit power allocations of jamming signals and acoustic signals over multiple USNs. We formulate the strategic power allocation problem for the SN and AUV as an asymmetric anti-jamming Colonel Blotto (CB) game model with a finite budget of total transmit powers. In particular, the competitive interactions between the SN and the AUV is modeled as the competition of two players in the game for limited resource budgets over the battlefield set. We analyze the mixed-strategy Nash equilibrium to the game, and obtain the closed-form performance bound of the defense power allocation strategy. Numerical results show the superiority of the proposed CB game based multi-USN secure transmission scheme as compared to the benchmarks in terms of the expected sum-utility. © 1967-2012 IEEE.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85188000591&doi=10.1109%2fTVT.2024.3367935&partnerID=40&md5=5e4bb6937f8d1b13ed544ecdf90c30f9,IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology,2024
BioKA-ASVN: Biometric-Based Key Agreement Scheme for Air Smart Vehicular Networks Using Blockchain Service,"Air Smart Vehicular Networks (ASVNs) have become increasingly essentials in military and commercial industries in recent years, where drones are deployed to interact among each other via wireless medium in airspace due to their agility and versatility. ASVNs can form a closed loop from data perception to final execution by integrating communication devices, computation tools, and control modules. However, the used unencrypted and publicly available navigational signals like Global Positioning System (GPS) and communication over (public) insecure Internet connections, including wireless networks and WiFi, make ASVNs vulnerable to security breaches. Attackers can easily gain access to a drone's configuration and take control remotely, by launching various attacks such as GPS spoofing, false sensor data injection, maldrone malware injection, eavesdropping, man-in-the-middle, Denial-of-Service (DoS), replay, forgery, and Skyjack attacks. This paper proposes a robust and efficient multi-factor biometric-based security mechanism using blockchain as a service to address the security and privacy breaches in ASVNs. A comparative study demonstrates that the proposed scheme provides superior security and better functionality features with low communication and computation overheads as compared to the existing analogous schemes. The feasibility of the proposed scheme in real-life drone applications is also demonstrated through a real-time testbed and blockchain simulation. Furthermore, a detailed security analysis using the automated software validation tool, namely Scyther, verifies the proposed scheme's significant level of security.  © 1967-2012 IEEE.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85188935996&doi=10.1109%2fTVT.2024.3380392&partnerID=40&md5=e290dd10dd4d6b191709db0660bdcf4c,IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology,2024
Hybrid Trajectory Planning for Connected and Autonomous Vehicle Considering Communication Spoofing Attacks,"In this study, we introduce a novel hybrid trajectory planning algorithm for autonomous driving, specifically designed to mitigate the risks posed by spoofing attacks on Connected and Autonomous Vehicles (CAVs). The research begins by assessing the safety implications of attacks and developing an adaptive safety model that is grounded in the fundamental assessment of state and decision data. This model incorporates the establishment of a posterior probability distribution for decision data, rooted in the pre-existing prior distribution but adjusted to account for the influence of spoofing attacks. The adjustment is achieved through Bayesian maximum posterior estimation, thereby refining the model to better adapt to potential threats. The adaptive safety model is then optimized dynamically, taking into consideration a set of indices - safety, comfort, and efficiency - that are critical to trajectory planning. In the subsequent phase, we introduce a composite trajectory planning algorithm that integrates a lateral trajectory selection sampling method with a longitudinal trajectory optimization approach. The adaptive safety model is seamlessly integrated into the trajectory planning process, influencing target position selection, the setting of constraints, and the formulation of the optimization objective function. The results demonstrate that the algorithm effectively limits the average standard deviation of lateral displacement to 0.5851 and achieves a significant increase in longitudinal speed growth rate, by up to 7.30%, surpassing the performance of benchmark algorithms. The proposed solution consistently delivers optimal safety and efficiency across various scenarios and under different parameter conditions.  © 2024 IEEE.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85188523613&doi=10.1109%2fTITS.2024.3373818&partnerID=40&md5=cd8e817789f3eab89da5768df947b804,IEEE Transactions on Intelligent Transportation Systems,2024
A Secure UAV Cooperative Communication Framework: Prospect Theory Based Approach,"Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) have attracted extensive attention from both industry and academia owing to their high mobility, line-of-sight (LoS) characteristics of air-to-ground (A2G) channels, and low cost. However, the broadcast nature of wireless transmission and the LoS characteristics of A2G channels are vulnerable to eavesdropping attacks, which leads to severe security issues. To enhance the security of UAV communication, we propose a framework that multiple UAVs cooperate to resist attacks (MURA). Specifically, we first introduce an efficient incentive scheme based on the coalition game to motivate UAVs to participate in a coalition. By forming a grand coalition, we demonstrate that each individual UAV can maximize its utility. Additionally, we propose a secure UAV communication scheme designed to counter eavesdropping attacks. Two distinct types of scenarios are considered in UAV communication. In a completely rational scenario, in which participants make decisions aiming to maximize their utility, we utilize the Stackelberg game to model the interactions between UAVs and attacker. The existence and uniqueness of the equilibrium solution are proved, and the equilibrium solution is obtained. In the context of an imperfectly rational scenario, we employ the prospect theory (PT) to effectively capture the underlying rationality exhibited by the players. The PT valuations of the players, i.e., UAV and attacker, are deduced in detail. Meanwhile, the convergence of the PT valuations of UAV and attacker is proved. Finally, extensive simulation results show that the proposed scheme can effectively improve the utility of legal UAVs and ensure the security of the UAV networks compared with benchmarks.  © 2024 IEEE.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85186101883&doi=10.1109%2fTMC.2024.3367124&partnerID=40&md5=50513cdd051710f426c01f63e8730211,IEEE Transactions on Mobile Computing,2024
Connected and Autonomous Vehicles in Web3: An Intelligence-Based Reinforcement Learning Approach,"'Read-write-own' based Web3 has been proposed as a promising user-centric Internet to open the new generation of the World Wide Web, where Web3 users can independently manage data and derive value from creating content without relying on intermediaries. Connected and autonomous vehicles (CAVs) in Web3 can trade models in a self-controlled and decentralized credible way, which is a fundamentally and principally innovation based on novel architecture. Effectively implementing such paradigms involves proper model trading strategies. However, reinforcement learning (RL)-based strategies face challenges of poor generalization ability, low feasibility, and the exploration-exploitation dilemma. It is also difficult to define an explicit and appropriate reward function. Therefore, in this paper, we propose an intelligence-based reinforcement learning (IRL) approach for CAVs in Web3. We present a framework to enable model transactions between CAVs. Also, we provide a decentralized identifier (DID)-based identity management system for resource description and data verification to access Web3, followed by the mechanism and supporting smart contracts. Furthermore, we formulate the model trading issue as an active inference to form higher-level cognition about the environment without rewards. Then we use IRL to solve it. And we use 'intelligence,' a high-level indicator, to quantify the efficiency of such cognition. It can evaluate the difference between the predicted state and the real state in policy exploration. The proposed scheme shows good generalization and can auto-balance exploration and exploitation, simultaneously achieving outperforming performance on the model trading issue with no rewards. In simulations, the performance of the proposed scheme is compared with existing methods.  © 2000-2011 IEEE.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85184327756&doi=10.1109%2fTITS.2024.3355179&partnerID=40&md5=798d7cba5e654290c6c1087e3d4c021c,IEEE Transactions on Intelligent Transportation Systems,2024
A Scheme for Protecting Source Location Privacy Based on Hierarchical Structure in Smart Ocean,"In the process of data acquisition of underwater acoustic sensor networks (UASNs), the safety of the network is threatened by the disclosure of source node location information. So how to protect the security and privacy of source node location is the main challenge faced by UASN security. To realize this taeget, a hierarchical structure-based algorithm for protecting source location privacy (HSSLP) is proposed in this paper. Firstly, it is proposed to divide UASNs into dynamic and static layers based on Ekman drift model. Location privacy protection schemes suitable for source nodes located in different layers have been proposed separately. In the static layer, k-means clustering separates the nodes into groups, and the source node's location privacy is protected using fake source node and phantom nodes, while auxiliary cluster head and sleep scheduling mechanism are used to save node energy. Nodes in the dynamic layer, whose positions are prone to change, are no longer clustered. The source node makes use of inducing nodes to take adversaries away from the source node, enhancing the privacy and security of the source node with minimal energy expenditure. Finally, autonomous underwater vehicles (AUV) need to support the cluster head in collecting data combined in the static layer and data uploaded in the dynamic layer. Based on the communication range of AUV, the network is segmented into areas, and when the AUV receives warning messages while traveling, it changes its route to lead the adversary to an area remote from the source node. Simulation results show that the proposed algorithm owns the capacity to balance the relationship between network security, transmission delay, and node energy consumption. To be more specific, the HSSLP algorithm improves the safety time by about 50%, reduces the delay by about 20% and saves the node energy by about 36% as compared to the DIS-PLP algorithm.  © 2000-2011 IEEE.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85184331311&doi=10.1109%2fTITS.2024.3355456&partnerID=40&md5=9802195d0db04b7d84fd14cc23bd0e3b,IEEE Transactions on Intelligent Transportation Systems,2024
A UAV-Assisted Authentication Protocol for Internet of Vehicles,"— As a component of the Intelligent Transportation System (ITS), Internet of Vehicles (IoV) is becoming increasingly important in the management and construction of urban transportation as it can provide users with a range of applications related to traffic accident warnings, entertainment information, collaborative driving and real-time road information through communication devices on vehicles. However, with the increasing variety of services in the IoV, the growing demand for user traffic and the advances in Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) technology, UAV is introduced into the IoV as a solution, which can relieve the pressure on the communication infrastructure in the network, provide emergency communication services and improve the performance of network services. Due to the openness of IoV and the high-speed movement of vehicles, authentication and privacy issues are among the most pressing issues in IoV. Therefore, the paper proposes a secure and effective authentication protocol for UAV-assisted IoV. The protocol utilises elliptic curve cryptography to assure the security of the authentication. The protocol undergoes proof of security, Burrows-Abadi-Needham (BAN) logic analysis and informal security analysis to ensure secure and mutual authentication, and have a good resistance to known attacks. Furthermore, performance analysis and comparison are conducted to evaluate the efficiency of our protocol. The results indicate that our protocol has superior advantages in overhead. © 2024 IEEE.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85186968680&doi=10.1109%2fTITS.2024.3360251&partnerID=40&md5=f48c7c9299f6066f1b9d9e1170593b6e,IEEE Transactions on Intelligent Transportation Systems,2024
Turning Noises to Fingerprint-Free 'Credentials': Secure and Usable Drone Authentication,"Drones have been widely used in various services, such as delivery and surveillance. Authentication forms the foundation of the security of these services. However, drones are expensive and may carry important payloads. To avoid being captured by attackers, drones should keep a safe distance from the verifier before authentication succeeds. This makes authentication methods that only work in very close proximity not applicable. Our work leverages drone noises for authentication. While using sounds for authentication is highly usable, how to handle various attacks that manipulate sounds is an unresolved challenge. It is also unclear how to ensure robustness under various environmental sounds. Being the first in the literature, we address the two major challenges by exploiting unique characteristics of drone noises. We thereby build an authentication system that does not rely on any drone sound fingerprints, keeps resilient to attacks, and is robust under environmental sounds. An extensive evaluation demonstrates its security and usability.  © 2024 IEEE.

ESMU: Efficient and Secure High-Precision Map Upload and Update Scheme in Intelligent IoT System,"With the development of autonomous driving technology, the accuracy requirements for electronic maps are becoming increasingly high.And high-precision maps, as a key carrier of intelligent IoT System in the field of transportation, has become a necessity for autonomous driving. The drawing of high-precision maps cannot be separated from the data collection of convoys, but there are security issues, such as pseudo mobility attacks and low-data privacy in this process. Therefore, a hybrid authentication architecture for map collection vehicles and base stations (BSs) based on alliance blockchain is proposed. This architecture has significant effectiveness in resisting mobile pseudo BS attacks, achieving authentication of access point vehicles by mobile BSs. At the same time, in order to effectively adapt to high-precision map scenarios, the proposed key distribution strategy and high-precision map update method are both lightweight.

Neurodynamics-Based Attack-Defense Guidance of Autonomous Surface Vehicles Against Multiple Attackers for Domain Protection,"This article investigates an adversarial domain protection scenario involving multiple defending underactuated autonomous surface vehicles (ASVs) against an equal number of attacking ASVs in an obstructive environment. The defending ASVs can only obtain the positions of the attacking ASVs susceptible of stochastic measurement noises. A three-layer attack-defense guidance structure is proposed such that the defending ASVs are able to intercept the attacking ASVs with collision-free behaviors. In the first layer, an auction theory is utilized to achieve the attack-defense matching that efficiently assigns multiple defending ASVs to corresponding attacking ASVs in a distributed manner. In the second layer, an adaptive attack-defense guidance method is proposed, enabling each underactuated defending ASV to implement the appropriate guidance law aligned with the optimal interception point. In the last layer, a quadratic programming problem is formulated using speed-heading-constraint control barrier functions, and a neurodynamics optimization approach is employed to achieve real-time resolution of the optimal attack-defense guidance signal. The stability and safety analyses show that the system error is practically stochastic input-to-state stable, and the system is guaranteed to be safe. Experiment results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed neurodynamics-based attack-defense guidance method for domain protection. © 2024 IEEE.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85187261933&doi=10.1109%2fTIE.2024.3360603&partnerID=40&md5=962ac919a5d3d7fc21e1bc2bfe044a34,IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics,2024
Multi-Process Federated Learning With Stacking for Securing 6G-V2X Network Slicing at Cross-Borders,"Being part of the 6G ecosystem vision, Connected and Automated Vehicles (CAVs) will enjoy sophisticated tailored services offering road safety and entertainment for users. As one of the 6G cornerstones, Network Slicing (NS) allows the creation of various customized 6G-V2X (Vehicle-to-Everything) use cases on the same physical infrastructure. However, 6G-NS advances can open up breaches to cyber-attacks aiming to break 6G-V2X Network slices to inflict maximum damage on CAVs and their users. Crossing borders, where CAVs leave their V2X-NS (V2X Network Slice) in the Home Mobile Network Operator (H-MNO) toward a similar V2X-NS in the Visited MNO (V-MNO), is an attractive opportunity to exploit by attackers. Detecting and mitigating attacks, in this case, becomes a priority, confronted by NS requirements and MNOs not ready to share their private data. To this end, this paper proposes a 3GPP-compliant privacy preservation collaborative learning scheme for 6G-NS security, focusing on V2X-NS cross-border areas. Our scheme leverages multi-process Federated Learning (FL) architecture to build efficient V2X-NS security-related models while preserving 6G V2X-NS isolation. In addition, it uses differential privacy-enabled stacking to build up attack detection knowledge at the V2X-NSs and MNOs levels while ensuring privacy preservation. We conducted an experimental study on the 5G-NIDD dataset, which is one of the most realistic publicly available 5G datasets. Our results demonstrate that multi-process FL with stacking can deliver high accuracy while ensuring isolation between 6G-V2X-NSs and privacy preservation between H-MNO and V-MNO.  © 2000-2011 IEEE.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85187006638&doi=10.1109%2fTITS.2024.3367388&partnerID=40&md5=1d0cfde5bfa21cd1ddf205745245fded,IEEE Transactions on Intelligent Transportation Systems,2024
Guard-Net: Lightweight Stereo Matching Network via Global and Uncertainty-Aware Refinement for Autonomous Driving,"Stereo matching is a prominent research area in autonomous driving and computer vision. Despite significant progress made by learning-based methods, accurately predicting disparities in hazardous regions, which is crucial for ensuring safe vehicle operation, remains challenging. The limitations of methods based on Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) are most noticeable in textureless regions and repetitive patterns, leading to unreliable predictions. Furthermore, calculating disparities for boundaries and thin structures, where the disparity jump phenomenon is prominent remains difficult. To address these issues, we propose a lightweight stereo matching architecture that focuses on obtaining real-Time and high-precision disparity maps in hazardous areas. We exploit an efficient global enhanced path to provide global representations in ill-posed regions, where CNN-based approaches often struggle. Second, our model integrates local and global features to generate more reliable cost volume. Finally, our innovative uncertainty-Aware module refines disparity, making full use of high-frequency detailed information and uncertainty attention, effectively preserving complex structures. Comprehensive experimental studies on SceneFlow demonstrate our method outperforms state-of-The-Art methods, achieving an End-Point Error (EPE) of 0.47 with only 3.60M parameters. The effectiveness of our method speed-Accuracy trade-off is further confirmed by competitive results obtained from the KITTI 2012 and KITTI 2015 experiments.

Control Layer Security: Exploiting Unobservable Cooperative States of Autonomous Systems for Secret Key Generation,"The rapid growth of autonomous systems (ASs) with data sharing means new cybersecurity methods have to be developed for them. Existing computational complexity-based cryptography does not have information-theoretical bounds and poses threats to superior computational attackers. This post-quantum cryptography issue indeed motivated the rapid advances in using common physical layer properties to generate symmetrical cipher keys (known as PLS). However, PLS remains sensitive to attackers (e.g., jamming) that destroy its prerequisite wireless channel reciprocity. When ASs are in cooperative tasks (e.g., rescuing searching, and formation flight), they will behave cooperatively in the control layer. Inspired by this, we propose a new security mechanism called control layer security (CLS), which exploits the correlated but unobservable states of cooperative ASs to generate symmetrical cipher keys. This idea is then realized in the linearized UAV cooperative control scenario. The theoretical correlation coefficients between Alice's and Bob's states are computed, based on which common feature selection and key quantization steps are designed. The results from simulation and real UAV experiments show i) an approximately 90% key agreement rate is achieved, and ii) even an Eve with the known observable states and systems fails to estimate the unobservable states and the secret keys relied upon, due to the multiple-to-one mapping from unobservable states (pitch, roll and yaw angles) to the observable states (3D trajectory).

Mitigating Motion Sickness with Optimization-Based Motion Planning,"The acceptance of automated driving is under the potential threat of motion sickness. It hinders the passengers' willingness to perform secondary activities. In order to mitigate motion sickness in automated vehicles, we propose an optimization-based motion planning algorithm that minimizes the distribution of acceleration energy within the frequency range that is found to be the most nauseogenic. The algorithm is formulated into integral and receding-horizon variants and compared with a commonly used alternative approach aiming to minimize accelerations in general. The proposed approach can reduce frequency-weighted acceleration by up to 11.3% compared with not considering the frequency sensitivity for the price of reduced overall acceleration comfort. Our simulation studies also reveal a loss of performance by the receding-horizon approach over the integral approach when varying the preview time and nominal sampling time. The computation time of the receding-horizon planner is around or below the real-time threshold when using a longer sampling time but without causing significant performance loss. We also present the results of experiments conducted to measure the performance of human drivers on a public road section that the simulated scenario is actually based on. The proposed method can achieve a 19% improvement in general acceleration comfort or a 32% reduction in squared motion sickness dose value over the best-performing participant. The results demonstrate considerable potential for improving motion comfort and mitigating motion sickness using our approach in automated vehicles.  © 2016 IEEE.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85186310217&doi=10.1109%2fTIV.2023.3289854&partnerID=40&md5=c16a7b42a92f0fff414a49318b950038,IEEE Transactions on Intelligent Vehicles,2024
RIS-Assisted UAV-Enabled Green Communications for Industrial IoT Exploiting Deep Learning,"Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT), regarded as an important technology for Industry 4.0, has the capability to connect massive IoT devices anywhere and at anytime in manufacturing industry. Enabling such a huge network requires message delivering among sensors, actuators, controllers, and the remote control to be seamless and reliable. However, IIoT wireless environment typically faces challenges such as blockage caused by IoT obstacles. To tackle the above issue, the unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) and the reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS) are exploited in this article, which can provide favorable air-to-ground links and further rebuild the wireless channels. Moreover, the device-to-device (D2D) communication technique is introduced to enable direct information exchange between IoT devices. Specifically, we consider both the communication between the UAV and the cellular users (e.g., fixed IoT infrastructures) as well as the communication between D2D users (e.g., mobile IoT devices). Instead of only considering throughput, we focus on energy efficiency (EE) optimization for D2D users while guaranteeing the quality of service for cellular users, since energy-efficient transmission or green communication is important for IIoT scenarios. The transmit power, channel allocation parameters, and RIS's reflection coefficients are jointly optimized to maximize EE for D2D users. To solve the formulated optimization problem, both centralized and distributed optimization algorithms based on deep neural networks are provided. Simulation results show that the introduction of RIS can significantly improve system performance. Moreover, the proposed algorithms can approximate the optimal solutions without the need of exhaustive search.  © 2014 IEEE.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85186971863&doi=10.1109%2fJIOT.2024.3369687&partnerID=40&md5=099baf9f273e74cd31143a78f04530cf,IEEE Internet of Things Journal,2024
Active Learning-Based Model Predictive Coverage Control,"The problem of coverage control, i.e., of coordinating multiple agents to optimally cover an area, arises in various applications. However, coverage applications face two major challenges: 1) dealing with nonlinear dynamics while respecting system and safety critical constraints and 2) performing the task in an initially unknown environment. We solve the coverage problem by using a hierarchical framework, in which references are calculated at a central server and passed to the agents' local model predictive control (MPC) tracking schemes. Furthermore, to ensure that the environment is actively explored by the agents a probabilistic exploration-exploitation tradeoff is deployed. In addition, we derive a control framework that avoids the hierarchical structure by integrating the reference optimization in the MPC formulation. Active learning is then performed drawing inspiration from Upper Confidence Bound (UCB) approaches. For all developed control architectures, we guarantee closed-loop constraint satisfaction and convergence to an optimal configuration. Furthermore, all methods are tested and compared on hardware using a miniature car platform. © 1963-2012 IEEE.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85185390091&doi=10.1109%2fTAC.2024.3365569&partnerID=40&md5=0697b11146bf2f94d9a1e8ed9623ba6b,IEEE Transactions on Automatic Control,2024
Sustainability Opportunities and Ethical Challenges of AI-Enabled Connected Autonomous Vehicles Routing in Urban Areas,"The advent of Connected Autonomous Vehicles (CAVs) paves the way to a new era of urban traffic control and management, driven by Artificial Intelligence (AI)-enabled strategies. This advancement promises significant improvements in infrastructure use optimization, traffic delay reduction, and overall sustainability. The autonomous driving capabilities of CAVs, coupled with the communication technology, allow vehicles to play an active role in urban traffic control: they can follow tailored instructions and can act as highly accurate moving sensors for traffic authorities. However, such improved capabilities come at the cost of unprecedented vulnerabilities to cyber exploitation, and with the concrete potential to increase social and economic disparities. As an extension of TIV-DHW (Distributed/Decentralized Hybrid Workshop) on ERS (Ethics, Responsibility, and Sustainability), this letter explores how the AI-enabled routing methodology can enhance urban transportation sustainability while also discussing its ethical implications and challenges. © 2016 IEEE.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85181569846&doi=10.1109%2fTIV.2023.3345661&partnerID=40&md5=2fb0bde336c049ff2b6935c2c6117371,IEEE Transactions on Intelligent Vehicles,2024
A Cross-Scale Hierarchical Transformer With Correspondence-Augmented Attention for Inferring Bird's-Eye-View Semantic Segmentation,"As bird's-eye-view (BEV) semantic segmentation is simple-to-visualize and easy-to-handle, it has been applied in autonomous driving to provide the surrounding information to downstream tasks. Inferring BEV semantic segmentation conditioned on multi-camera-view images is a popular scheme in the community as cheap devices and real-time processing. The recent work implemented this task by learning the content and position relationship via Vision Transformer (ViT). However, its quadratic complexity confines the relationship learning only in the latent layer, leaving the scale gap to impede the representation of fine-grained objects. In view of information absorption, when representing position-related BEV features, their weighted fusion of all view feature imposes inconducive features to disturb the fusion of conducive features. To tackle these issues, we propose a novel cross-scale hierarchical Transformer with correspondence-augmented attention for semantic segmentation inference. Specifically, we devise a hierarchical framework to refine the BEV feature representation, where the last size is only half of the final segmentation. To save the computation increase caused by this hierarchical framework, we exploit the cross-scale Transformer to learn feature relationships in a reversed-aligning way, and leverage the residual connection of BEV features to facilitate information transmission between scales. We propose correspondence-augmented attention to distinguish conducive and inconducive correspondences. It is implemented in a simple yet effective way, amplifying attention scores before the Softmax operation, so that the position-view-related and the position-view-disrelated attention scores are highlighted and suppressed. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method has state-of-the-art performance in inferring BEV semantic segmentation conditioned on multi-camera-view images.  © 2000-2011 IEEE.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85182934292&doi=10.1109%2fTITS.2023.3348795&partnerID=40&md5=f9c91bdfc0404eeca82717fffc125ecc,IEEE Transactions on Intelligent Transportation Systems,2024
Evolutionary Decision-Making and Planning for Autonomous Driving: A Hybrid Augmented Intelligence Framework,"Recently, thanks to the introduction of human feedback, Chat Generative Pre-trained Transformer (ChatGPT) has achieved remarkable success in the language processing field. Analogically, human drivers are expected to have great potential in improving the performance of autonomous driving under real-world traffic. Therefore, this study proposes a novel framework for evolutionary decision-making and planning by developing a hybrid augmented intelligence (HAI) method to introduce human feedback into the learning process. In the framework, a decision-making scheme based on interactive reinforcement learning (Int-RL) is first developed. Specifically, a human driver evaluates the learning level of the ego vehicle in real-time and intervenes to assist the learning of the vehicle with a conditional sampling mechanism, which encourages the vehicle to pursue human preferences and punishes the bad experience of conflicts with the human. Then, the longitudinal and lateral motion planning tasks are performed utilizing model predictive control (MPC), respectively. The multiple constraints from the vehicle's physical limitation and driving task requirements are elaborated. Finally, a safety guarantee mechanism is proposed to ensure the safety of the HAI system. Specifically, a safe driving envelope is established, and a safe exploration/exploitation logic based on the trial-and-error on the desired decision is designed. Simulation with a high-fidelity vehicle model is conducted, and results show the proposed framework can realize an efficient, reliable, and safe evolution to pursue higher traffic efficiency of the ego vehicle in both multi-lane and congested ramp scenarios.  © 2000-2011 IEEE.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85182935151&doi=10.1109%2fTITS.2023.3349198&partnerID=40&md5=eb551b617b833772911b4a495fb84f76,IEEE Transactions on Intelligent Transportation Systems,2024
X-ray image analysis for explosive circuit detection using deep learning algorithms,"X-ray imaging technologies find applications across various domains, including medical imaging in health institutions or security in military facilities and public institutions. X-ray images acquired from diverse sources necessitate analysis by either trained human experts or automated systems. In cases where concealed electronic cards potentially pose threats, such as in laptops harboring explosive triggering circuits, conventional analysis methods are challenging to detect, even when scrutinized by skilled. The present investigation is centered on the utilization of deep learning algorithms for the analysis of X-ray images of laptop computers, with the aim of identifying concealed hazardous components. To construct the dataset, some control cards such as Arduino, Raspberry Pi and Bluetooth circuits were hidden inside the 60 distinct laptop computers and were subjected to X-ray imaging, yielding a total of 5094 X-ray images. The primary objective of this study is to distinguish laptops based on the presence or absence of concealed electronic cards. To this end, a suite of deep learning models, including EfficientNet, DenseNet, DarkNet19, DarkNet53, Inception, MobileNet, ResNet18, ResNet50, ResNet101, ShuffleNet and Xception were subjected to training, testing, and comparative evaluation. The performance of these models was assessed utilizing a range of metrics, encompassing accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, precision, f-measure, and g-mean. Among the various models examined, the ShuffleNet model emerged as the top-performing one, yielding superior results in terms of accuracy (0.8355), sensitivity (0.8199), specificity (0.8530), precision (0.8490), f-measure (0.8322), and g-mean (0.8352). © 2023 Elsevier B.V.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85180362802&doi=10.1016%2fj.asoc.2023.111133&partnerID=40&md5=9ffe7f59e9d92251a0cb5cd3f0ffe68d,Applied Soft Computing,2024
Distributed Data-Driven Control for a Connected Autonomous Vehicle Platoon Subjected to False Data Injection Attacks,"In this paper, we consider the need for deployment in the long-distance safe longitudinal formation control task when the connected autonomous vehicle (CAV) platoon is subjected to malicious cyber attacks. To ensure the safe, orderly, stable and efficient driving performance of the vehicle platoon, a novel distributed data-driven control (DDDC) approach for a homogeneous connected autonomous vehicle platoon under false data injection (FDI) attacks is investigated. First, an FDI attacks detection and compensation mechanism is designed to detect whether the received position signals are under attack or not and compensate the attacked position signals. Then, a novel DDDC approach for the vehicle platoon longitudinal formation control is developed by using the compensation data from the designed attack compensation mechanism and a dynamic linearization data model. Theoretical analysis verifies that the proposed DDDC method can ensure the internal stability (IS) and string stability (SS) of the homogeneous platoon subjected to FDI attacks. Finally, the effectiveness and practicality of the proposed DDDC approach are validated through a group of comparative simulations subjected to random FDI attacks of equal frequency and magnitude. Note to Practitioners - This work aims to solve the vehicle platoon long-distance safe longitudinal formation control task subjected to malicious FDI attacks. FDI attacks can achieve their destructive purposes by processing intercepted information and injecting false data into the original information. Existing literature overly relies on a priori knowledge of network attacks, yet in practice it is difficult to capture the true intentions of attackers in advance. For multi-channel V2V communication networks, it is even more important to design a resilient and accurate distributed controller strategy for such unpredictable and specific network attacks. Therefore, this paper proposes a data-driven distributed longitudinal formation control strategy with attack detection and compensation mechanism. The proposed strategy is shown to be able to ensure the safe longitudinal formation control task for the homogeneous CAV platoon suffering from FDI attacks. In addition, the stability of the CAV platoon is then investigated while the attacked signals are detected and cleaned, and it is shown to guarantee the internal stability of a single vehicle and the string stability of the platoon.  © 2004-2012 IEEE.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85181576670&doi=10.1109%2fTASE.2023.3345369&partnerID=40&md5=dc50cffd4465c39cce84e1375d2d1297,IEEE Transactions on Automation Science and Engineering,2024
Event-Triggered Distributed Intelligent Learning Control of Six-Rotor UAVs under FDI Attacks,"Aiming at the six-rotor unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) subjected to false data injection (FDI) attacks, an event-triggered-based distributed intelligent learning control strategy is proposed in this article. The reinforcement learning algorithm which is designed based on neural networks (NNs) is introduced to achieve intelligent optimal control. Under the actor-critic-identifier frame, three kinds of NNs are used to realize the control action, evaluate the system performance, and estimate the unknown dynamic, respectively. Then, an improved event-triggered strategy including a decreasing function of the consensus error is designed to reduce the waste of resources while decreasing the adverse impact on tracking control performance as far as possible, which also does not exhibit Zeno behavior. Furthermore, an adaptive compensation control scheme is given, which can effectively compensate for the negative impacts brought by the FDI attacks existing in information interaction among UAVs. Despite the impact of lumped disturbances and FDI attacks, the proposed disturbance-observer-based distributed intelligent learning control strategy can still guarantee that all signals in the closed-loop UAV systems are bounded, and all follower UAVs can track the signal of the leader UAV. Finally, some simulation verification diagrams are shown to test the feasibility of the designed control strategy. © 2020 IEEE.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85182349699&doi=10.1109%2fTAI.2024.3351095&partnerID=40&md5=b418165e4213bd81f1c230b2012171dc,IEEE Transactions on Artificial Intelligence,2024
A Privacy-Preserving-Based Distributed Collaborative Scheme for Connected Autonomous Vehicles at Multi-Lane Signal-Free Intersections,"This paper proposes a privacy-preserving distributed collaboration (PPDC) scheme for connected autonomous vehicles (CAVs) to cross signal-free intersections based on the cloud, while securing the private data of the vehicles. Firstly, this paper converts the cooperation problem into a multi-objective problem that aims to improve the efficiency of traffic and fuel economy. Secondly, to prevent the privacy of the transmitted data of vehicles from being inferred by untrusted cloud servers or external attackers, an affine masking-based privacy strategy is designed. Specifically, the vehicle first uploads the encrypted state data to the cloud with the affine masking method. Then the cloud returns the control input by solving the newly constructed optimization problem, which is different but equivalent to the original problem. Then the vehicle calculates the real control input by the inverse affine masking mechanism. Simulation examples show that the proposed PPDC scheme can guarantee collision avoidance and the privacy protection of transmitted data of CAVs, improve traffic efficiency as well as fuel economy, and avoid extensive computation burden.  © 2000-2011 IEEE.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85182928001&doi=10.1109%2fTITS.2023.3346395&partnerID=40&md5=fab46a70caae8530dd13c620ca119b16,IEEE Transactions on Intelligent Transportation Systems,2024

Accuracy-Aware Cooperative Sensing and Computing for Connected Autonomous Vehicles,"To maintain high perception performance among connected and autonomous vehicles (CAVs), in this paper, we propose an accuracy-aware and resource-efficient raw-level cooperative sensing and computing scheme among CAVs and road-side infrastructure. The scheme enables fined-grained partial raw sensing data selection, transmission, fusion, and processing in per-object granularity, by exploiting the parallelism among object classification subtasks associated with each object. A supervised learning model is trained to capture the relationship between the object classification accuracy and the data quality of selected object sensing data, facilitating accuracy-aware sensing data selection. We formulate an optimization problem for joint sensing data selection, subtask placement and resource allocation among multiple object classification subtasks, to minimize the total resource cost while satisfying the delay and accuracy requirements. A genetic algorithm based iterative solution is proposed for the optimization problem.

UGEN: UAV and GAN-Aided Ensemble Network for Post-Disaster Survivor Detection Through ORAN,"Post-disaster scene understanding frameworks are increasingly crucial in Search And Rescue (SAR) operations. Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) provide an efficient means to carry out the task of scene understanding due to the higher altitudes at which they function. However, complex environments in post-disaster scenarios make it difficult for UAVs to detect humans or objects accurately. Inefficient object detection mechanisms lead to low accuracy for object detection tasks. Hence, to mitigate these issues, we propose a UAV and GAN-aided Ensemble Network (UGEN) framework for efficient ORAN-based post-disaster survivor detection. This approach deploys a Context-Conditional Generative Adversarial Network (CCGAN)-based model to remove occlusion in the images obtained from the UAVs. The UGEN framework classifies entities present in the visual scope of the UAV using a semantic segmentation framework deployed on the CCGAN-enhanced images, resulting in a pixel-level prediction of entities present in the post-disaster images. An ensemble network comprising a combination of single-stage and multi-stage detectors detects survivors present in the post-disaster scenario, thereby combining the benefits of both architectures, resulting in a reduced false negative rate and improved performance. An Open Radio Access Network (ORAN) executes data propagation between the UAV and the ground station for reduced transmission latency. The proposed model achieved a survivor detection accuracy of 96.7%. © 1967-2012 IEEE.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85181562908&doi=10.1109%2fTVT.2023.3349312&partnerID=40&md5=f959d0e78031a715254a14be08270382,IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology,2024
Safety Constrained Trajectory Optimization for Completion Time Minimization for UAV Communications,"In recent years, unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) are considered to be integrated into wireless communication systems because of their tremendous advantages in mobility, cost, maneuverability, etc. In some real UAV-assisted communication scenarios, the dynamics of the environment, such as the roaming of served users, make it hard to obtain an optimal trajectory before the UAV is dispatched. Implanting an intelligent control policy into UAVs for distributed task execution is necessary to complete the task. In this article, a UAV trajectory design problem is investigated for an orthorgonal-frequency-division-multiplexing (OFDM) wireless sensor network, which is dynamic because mobile sensors may randomly roam within a certain range. The UAV is expected to balance task efficiency with the safety constraint with a pretrained onboard control policy. Compared to prior works, this work requires the policy to adapt to randomly generated obstacle maps, and also assumes that the UAV has no prior knowledge of the obstacles before it is dispatched, which brings about challenges to the problem. The motivation comes from adversarial environments without the specific obstacle distribution beforehand, such as a disaster area. The problem is formulated as a constrained Markov decision process (CMDP) model, which incorporates the safety constraint compared to a basic Markov decision process. Due to the assumption of randomized obstacle distribution and lack of prior knowledge, existing algorithms for CMDP can not be applied directly. To tackle this issue, we enhance the reinforcement learning (RL) algorithm with a safety control mechanism to derive our novel safe RL (Safe RL) algorithm, which is based on the framework of the Lagrangian method. Compared to former algorithms about CMDP, our algorithm eliminates the premise that the safety model is known, the agent is able to learn safety judgment from scratch through its interactions with the environment. Simulation results demonstrate that our proposed algorithm outperforms the benchmark algorithm under the problem's setup.  © 2024 IEEE.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85182944765&doi=10.1109%2fJIOT.2024.3355906&partnerID=40&md5=d343227ccb80098793d2458cb7131fbc,IEEE Internet of Things Journal,2024
Fooling Decision-Based Black-Box Automotive Vision Perception Systems in Physical World,"Autonomous vehicles use deep neural networks (DNNs) to build powerful vision perception systems, which provide a theoretical foundation for automated vehicle control. Due to the inherent vulnerability of DNNs, many research works have implemented white-box attacks against automotive vision perception systems in the physical world. However, successful black-box attacks (especially decision-based) in the physical world are rarely mentioned because it is difficult to implement a physical-world adversarial attack without internal knowledge about the vision perception systems. In this paper, we propose PRAD, an end-to-end framework that transfers the existing decision-based black-box adversarial attack algorithms (as the backbone of the framework) targeting the digital domain to the physical world for the first time. Specifically, T(cdot) is first introduced to simulate the real environment changes, e.g., angle, distance, slight shaking, illumination, etc. Then, and crucially, PRAD bridges the non-differentiable black-box attack and the differentiable T(cdot) by the L_{1} loss function. We use the traffic sign recognition system in the vision perception system as an object to conduct comprehensive experiments, including different environmental conditions, black-box attack backbones, models, and datasets. The results demonstrate that the generated adversarial examples in the decision-based black-box setting can fool the commercial traffic sign recognition system into outputting designated misclassifications with high success rates and strong robustness in the physical world (average 90% in target attacks and nearly 100% in non-target attacks), which outperforms the state-of-the-art homogeneous attack methods.  © 2000-2011 IEEE.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85182938594&doi=10.1109%2fTITS.2023.3347860&partnerID=40&md5=77f83db6caaa6c8e0c25ef591163937e,IEEE Transactions on Intelligent Transportation Systems,2024
Fusion-Based Event-Triggered H∞ State Estimation of Networked Autonomous Surface Vehicles With Measurement Outliers and Cyber-Attacks,"This paper investigates the fusion-based event- triggered H∞ state estimation of autonomous surface vehi- cles (ASVs) against measurement outliers and cyber-attacks. To release communication burden, a novel fusion-based event- triggered mechanism (FETM) dependent on the fusion of historical system outputs is proposed. There exist two advantages of this mechanism: 1) the use of fusion signal is able to avoid the information loss between two sampling instants and reduce the redundant triggering events resulted from system disturbances and noises; 2) by requiring the error signal in the triggering condition not only lager than a lower threshold but also less than an upper threshold, the false triggering events incurred by measurement outliers also can be discarded. Then, a time-varying delay system is established to represent the event-triggered H∞ state estimation error system with network-induced delays. Then, sufficient conditions are deduced for solving H∞ estimator gain and triggering matrix of FETM. Lastly, some simulation results are given to illustrate the merits of the theoretical method.  © 2000-2011 IEEE.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85182953864&doi=10.1109%2fTITS.2024.3350536&partnerID=40&md5=4087b55af465099be181441f1c123676,IEEE Transactions on Intelligent Transportation Systems,2024
Dynamic Event-Triggered Model Predictive Control Under Channel Fading and Denial-of-Service Attacks,"This article presents a model predictive control (MPC) design based on dynamic event-triggered mechanism (DETM). In the sensor-to-controller channel, the networks are unreliable in the sense that the transmitted signals may suffer from channel fading which is characterized by a stochastic process. In the controller-to-actuator network, the Denial-of-Service (DoS) attacks are taken into consideration whose dynamic behavior is described by a binary Markov process. Moreover, the external disturbance is considered. First, a DETM is employed to schedule the data transmission with the aim of reducing the communication burden. Then, an H∞-type cost function is applied in the MPC design to improve the system's robustness against disturbance. Different from the conventional MPC, the novelty of developed MPC is that it can improve the communication efficiency and enhance the robustness against these network-induced issues simultaneously. At last, the validity and superiority of the proposed technique are demonstrated by simulation studies. Note to Practitioners - With the development of information technologies, the practical control systems are highly integrated with wireless networks. In such case, the network-induced issues are very important. For example, in the platooning control of automated vehicles, the conventional time-triggered control scheme leads to unnecessary waste of communication resource and thus heavy communication burden. Especially, this issue becomes particularly important when the number of vehicles increases. This article was motivated by this and it suggests a new control design based on DETM. Moreover, in control systems, it is necessary to utilize the state measurement to compute control signals. However, when the measured state information is affected by DoS attacks and channel fading, the system performance and even stability will be seriously damaged. Furthermore, the external disturbances widely exist in practical engineering. Considering the influence of these issues, this paper studies the design of MPC. The obtained results aim to provide a helpful reference for the controller design under various network-induced issues, involving bandwidth constraints, DoS attacks and channel fading. It is expected that the proposed MPC design can be applied to more practical engineering systems. © 2023 IEEE.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85176334731&doi=10.1109%2fTASE.2023.3325534&partnerID=40&md5=562a31906faeaac02feda1b9fd05cee4,IEEE Transactions on Automation Science and Engineering,2024
An Interpretable Image Denoising Framework via Dual Disentangled Representation Learning,"Various unfavourable conditions such as fog, snow and rain may degrade image quality and pose tremendous threats to the safety of autonomous driving. Numerous image-denoising solutions have been proposed to improve visibility under adverse weather conditions. However, previous studies have been limited in robustness, generalization ability, and interpretability as they were designed for specific scenarios. To address this problem, we introduce an interpretable image denoising framework via Dual Disentangled Representation Learning (DDRL) to enhance robustness and interpretability by decomposing an image into content factors (e.g., objects) and context factors (e.g., weather conditions). DDRL consists of two Disentangled Representation Learning (DRL) blocks. In each DRL block, an input image is deconstructed into the latent content distribution and the weather distribution by minimizing their mutual information. To mitigate the impacts of weather styles, we incorporated a content discriminator and adversarial objectives to learn the decomposable interaction between two DRL blocks. Furthermore, we standardized the weather feature space, enabling our method to be applicable to various downstream tasks such as diverse degraded image generation. We evaluated DDRL under three weather conditions including fog, rain, and snow. The experimental results demonstrate that DDRL shows competitive performance with good generalization capability and high robustness under numerous weather conditions.

Although the application of these technologies facilitates our lives, they also bring a series of vulnerable interfaces (such as 5G, Bluetooth, and WiFi), which pose a significant security threat to existing in-vehicle networks. To address these threats, researchers have proposed two mainstream schemes, including message authentication and intrusion detection system (IDS), where the scheme of message authentication needs to occupy the limited bandwidth of controller area network (CAN) bus. Furthermore, most IDSs either cannot locate the sender of the attack, fail to detect aperiodic malicious frames, or require prior knowledge of which CAN identifiers (IDs) belong to which electronic control units (ECUs). To address these weaknesses, we propose a practical voltage-based IDS named IdentifierIDS for real in-vehicle networks. To the best of our knowledge, it is the first scheme to detect intrusions by establishing a voltage fingerprint for each ID without the need for prior knowledge. This allows IdentifierIDS to detect both periodic and aperiodic malicious frames without occupying the limited bandwidth of the CAN bus. As a self-learning IDS, it can adapt to different in-vehicle networks without the need for customization for them. Experiments on three real vehicles demonstrate the robustness of our scheme in different in-vehicle networks. © 2023 IEEE.

Threat Assessment Strategy of Human-in-the-Loop Unmanned Underwater Vehicle Under Uncertain Events,"Gls UUV is an intelligent underwater platform that can operate autonomously. However, it is difficult for unmanned underwater vehicle (UUV) to make correct decisions timely and independently in the face of uncertain events. Therefore, it is necessary to assess the threat of uncertain events and guide UUV to make timely and accurate decisions. This article studies the threat assessment strategy of a human-in-the-loop UUV under uncertain events. First, the uncertain events are classified according to their characteristics, and the Bayesian network (BN) is constructed by taking the characteristic variables of uncertain events as neurons. Then, the human experiences are combined with the genetic optimization algorithm to determine the BN parameters. According to the reasoning of the BN, the threat of uncertain events is evaluated. Finally, according to the threat assessment results, the PSO and A/B model are used to replan the task. The proposed algorithm uses BN to represent uncertain events and introduces human experiences to optimize network parameters, eliminating subjective bias and improving the accuracy of threat assessment. At the same time, the task replanning strategy is introduced to ensure the security of UUV. Four typical UUV tasks are designed, and the trigger elements of uncertain events are set in the simulation to verify the performance of the proposed algorithm. The simulation and experiment results show that a UUV can accurately assess the threat level of uncertain events during the task execution process when using the proposed strategy. The safety of the human-in-the-loop UUV operation is guaranteed by task replanning. © 2013 IEEE.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85173006705&doi=10.1109%2fTSMC.2023.3311778&partnerID=40&md5=00b3d5b27258383d62aecc39a81861db,"IEEE Transactions on Systems, Man, and Cybernetics: Systems",2024
Performance Analysis and Design of Intelligent Optimising Integral-Based Event-Trigger Control for Autonomous Ground Vehicles under DoS Attacks,"This study investigates the stability of an autonomous ground vehicle dynamics model in the presence of novel denial of service (DoS) attacks. An algorithm that utilizes an asymmetric Lyapunov-Krasovskii function to reduce decision variables effectively is proposed. By partitioning the LKF for asymmetric LKF trimming, we ensure a tighter upper bound on the remaining part of the function using appropriate integral inequalities. Additionally, an improved alternating direction algorithm (ADA) is employed to optimize the threshold selection problem while considering initial constraints. Subsequently, we design an intelligent integral-based event-triggering controller (IIETC) that incorporates random trigger signal loss to guarantee AGV stability.

A cyber-physical social system for autonomous drone trajectory planning in last-mile superchilling delivery,"Logistics drones are theoretically advantageous in automating last-mile delivery activities, but practically challenging in urban environments, including public concerns about risk of crashes and privacy. In view of the above concerns existing in the trajectory planning of logistics drones, this paper presents a parallel automatic delivery model following the cyber-physical social system (CPSS) for the last mile delivery of superchilling products, revealing the social value of logistics drone operations. Considering the operational constraints of logistics drone, a multi-objective optimisation model is established to balance the social value, energy efficiency and productivity of using logistics drones in the last-mile superchilling delivery. To effectively achieve the above optimisation, improved strategies, including the material exchange mechanism based on the random proportion rule and the Universe-Particle search strategy, are developed, resulting in an improved two-stage heuristic algorithm. Finally, simulation experiments are carried out in a simulated environment with 154 buildings, and compared with other frontier algorithms used for unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) trajectory planning. The results show that the proposed framework can effectively reduce the threats to public life safety and improve the energy efficiency of logistics drones, while ensuring the productivity in the delivery process. © 2023 Elsevier Ltd",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85179487660&doi=10.1016%2fj.trc.2023.104448&partnerID=40&md5=f36ac5004f438bd94e7fb0425d7aebbe,Transportation Research Part C: Emerging Technologies,2024
Goal-Guided and Interaction-Aware State Refinement Graph Attention Network for Multi-Agent Trajectory Prediction,"Multi-agent trajectory prediction plays a pivotal role for intelligent transportation and autonomous driving. Modeling the social interaction among agents and revealing the inherent relationship between interaction and future trajectory are crucial for accurate trajectory prediction. To address these challenges, this letter proposes a goal-guided and interaction-aware state refinement graph attention network (SRGAT) for multi-agent trajectory prediction. Specifically, the trajectory sequence of individual agent is firstly converted into a compact representation by exploiting Transformer encoder and gated recurrent unit (GRU). Then, a social state refinement (SSR) module for modeling social influence between agents is proposed to include more interaction-related features. Subsequently, multiple goals are predicted for each agent, followed by another goal-guided SSR module to incorporate goal information into social interaction. Finally, the multimodal trajectory is forecasted by fusing the features from forward and backward GRU. Experiments on public benchmark datasets are carried out to evaluate the effectiveness of our model. The results demonstrate the superior performance of our model compared with the state-of-the-art methods.  © 2016 IEEE.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85177058824&doi=10.1109%2fLRA.2023.3331651&partnerID=40&md5=cec0de64610251bbd6692d8496c0e2c6,IEEE Robotics and Automation Letters,2024
An Anti-Spoofing Model Based on MVM and MCCM for a Loosely-Coupled GNSS/INS /LiDAR Kalman Filter,"GNSS/INS/LiDAR-based Multi-Sensor Fusion (MSF) systems facilitate the efficient integration of multiple navigation sensors to deliver stable and dependable positioning outcomes in Autonomous Vehicles (AVs). Generally, AVs are bound to operate in diverse scenarios. However, state-of-the-art spoofing attack algorithms can identify vulnerable periods of MSF systems and execute aggressive GNSS spoofing in certain specific scenarios with high success rates. The present study proposes a security defense algorithm for MSF systems based on an enhanced Kalman filter, incorporating the Measurement Variance Monitoring (MVM) and Minimum Constraint of Covariance Matrix (MCCM) model. MVM effectively constrains the impact of GNSS signals with large positioning errors, thereby mitigating the adverse effects caused by spoofing attacks. MCCM fully leverages LiDAR information between two consecutive GNSS signals to enhance the credibility of LiDAR measurements, thus improving the positioning correction capability. Furthermore, considering the diverse application environments of AVs, this paper primarily focuses on sensor uncertainty variation and validates different models in varying scenarios. Ultimately, real-world data demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed anti-spoofing model, which can significantly mitigate positioning errors caused by GNSS spoofing attacks without affecting navigation accuracy. © 2016 IEEE.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85178027531&doi=10.1109%2fTIV.2023.3335356&partnerID=40&md5=e4003bab467b87d5c56e1dbe18bf232a,IEEE Transactions on Intelligent Vehicles,2024
R3O: Robust Radon Radar Odometry,"Being able to measure and track positions of mobile systems is an important capability in many applications, autonomous driving being one major example. With the Robust Radon Radar Odometry algorithm, this article presents an approach for estimating the odometry of vehicles based on radar data only. The algorithm embodies a robust method for estimating the change in orientation as a key feature. The odometry algorithm is under the realm of direct methods, and it exploits properties of the Fourier transform for decoupling the changes in orientation from the changes in translation. In the first step, the Radon transform along with phase-correlation, outlier removal, robust measure of central tendency, keyframe selection and graph optimization are used in order to achieve a robust method for estimating the change in orientation, next the translation is estimated with the support of phase-correlation. The algorithm's performance was evaluated with real world data. Significant improvements in position and orientation error in terms of relative pose error and the KITTI odometry error metric are shown as compared to other direct methods for radar based odometry.  © 2016 IEEE.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85174819950&doi=10.1109%2fTIV.2023.3324941&partnerID=40&md5=add40704c54d9712b4f0b3a5896f3f69,IEEE Transactions on Intelligent Vehicles,2024
REDFormer: Radar Enlightens the Darkness of Camera Perception with Transformers,"Enhancing the accuracy and reliability of perception systems in automated vehicles is critical, especially under varying driving conditions. Unfortunately, the challenges of adverse weather and low-visibility conditions can seriously degrade camera performance, introducing significant risks to vehicle safety. To address these concerns, in this study, we introduce a novel transformer-based 3D object detection model named 'REDFormer'. By exploiting bird's-eye-view camera-radar fusion, the REDFormer offers a more practical and financially viable solution for tackling low-visibility conditions. We validate our model using the comprehensive nuScenes dataset, incorporating camera images, multi-radar point clouds, weather information, and time-of-day data. In comparative analyses, our model surpasses state-of-the-art benchmarks in both classification and detection accuracy. An in-depth ablation study further elucidates the individual contributions of each model component in overcoming the challenges posed by weather and lighting conditions. Experimental results specifically highlight the model's significant performance improvements, demonstrating a 31.31% increase in accuracy under rainy conditions and a 46.99% enhancement during nighttime scenarios, affirming REDFormer's potential as a robust and cost-effective solution for automated vehicles.  © 2016 IEEE.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85177081440&doi=10.1109%2fTIV.2023.3329708&partnerID=40&md5=09e8e6cb32a90495d731e3fdbd3afd3c,IEEE Transactions on Intelligent Vehicles,2024
Cybersecurity on Connected and Automated Transportation Systems: A Survey,"Connected and automated vehicles (CAVs) provide various valuable and advanced services to manufacturers, owners, mobility service providers, and transportation authorities. As a result, a large number of CAV applications have been proposed to improve the safety, mobility, and sustainability of the transportation system. With the increasing connectivity and automation, cybersecurity of the connected and automated transportation system (CATS) has raised attention to the transportation community in recent years. Vulnerabilities in CAVs can lead to breakdowns in the transportation system and compromise safety (e.g., causing crashes), performance (e.g., increasing congestion and reducing capacity), and fairness (e.g., vehicles fooling traffic signals). This paper presents our perspective on CATS cybersecurity via surveying recent pertinent studies focusing on the transportation system level, ranging from individual and multiple vehicles to the traffic network (including infrastructure). It also highlights threat analysis and risk assessment (TARA) tools and evaluation platforms, particularly for analyzing the CATS cybersecurity problem.

Opposition-based differential evolution for synchronized control of multi-agent systems with uncertain nonlinear dynamics,"Multi-agent systems (MAS) have gained increasing research attention in recent years due to their wide applications in cooperative control of autonomous vehicles, sensor networks, robotics, etc. However, designing effective distributed control strategies for MAS with complex dynamics remains challenging. This paper proposes an improved differential evolution (DE) based cooperative control strategy to stabilize and synchronize MAS with uncertain nonlinear dynamics. Specifically, we develop a new mutation strategy inspired by opposition-based learning to enhance the exploration ability and adopt an adaptive parameter mechanism to balance exploration and exploitation. Moreover, a distributed sliding mode term is incorporated in the control input to counteract uncertainties and external disturbances. Rigorous stability analysis shows that the closed-loop MAS can achieve synchronization under the proposed control strategy. Extensive simulations demonstrate that compared to other state-of-the-art DE algorithms and cooperative control methods, the proposed strategy achieves lower synchronization error, control cost, higher convergence speed, and higher accuracy for MAS with different scales, dynamics, and uncertainties. © 2023 Elsevier B.V.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85178353632&doi=10.1016%2fj.asoc.2023.111044&partnerID=40&md5=464c296cea26e741483aa1514e25d2bc,Applied Soft Computing,2024
Hydrodynamics of a Remora-inspired autonomous underwater vehicle approaching and docking to a benchmark submarine,"Autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs) are applied in a variety of industries to increase the efficiency and safety of maritime operations. Traditional docking and recovery techniques for AUVs, however, can be inefficient. Therefore, the development of a dynamic underwater recovery mechanism for AUVs is now needed. Recent research has investigated the symbiotic relationship between the remora fish and the shark from a hydrodynamic perspective. Numerical simulations have demonstrated that by exploiting the boundary layer and adverse pressure gradient regions around the shark, the resistance experienced by remora fish can be significantly reduced. Inspired by this, an AUV was designed, and numerical simulations were conducted to investigate the impact of various attachment locations. Moreover, simulations were performed to investigate the hydrodynamic characteristics of the AUV during the docking process, specifically when it enters the boundary layer of the submarine and approaches it. The boundary layer flow, which influences the AUV's resistance, can also provide a force that attract the AUV towards the submarine. This research identifies an optimal attachment location and investigates the effects on the AUV when two underwater vehicles of significantly different sizes are in close proximity. It supports further study to develop a dynamic underwater docking operation. © 2023 The Authors",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85179433686&doi=10.1016%2fj.oceaneng.2023.116447&partnerID=40&md5=f035b42c1b266359a21537372bd6af23,Ocean Engineering,2024
Fast adversarial attacks to deep neural networks through gradual sparsification,"Deep learning networks, emerging machine learning models that present beyond human-level performance in terms of accuracy, are critically vulnerable to adversarial attacks. This vulnerability limits the utilization of deep learning architecture in many real-world safety-critical applications such as autonomous vehicles, medical diagnosis, sensitive industrial systems, etc. Adversarial attacks are methods to measure the robustness of different architectures and can be used to evaluate the suitability of a model to be used in a safety-critical situation. White-box sparse adversarial attacks can unhide interesting features of deep learning networks by identifying critical elements in the input pattern to design black-box attacks. This motivated us to design a new algorithmic procedure to design sparse adversarial attacks to feed-forward neural networks based on sparsity regularization. The proposed method comes with the gradual sparsification which starts by designing a dense attack and prone it until a desired level of sparsity is attained. We evaluate the performance of the proposed algorithm in designing attacks on convolutional neural networks and attention-based architectures for image classification task using three non-smooth sparsity-promoting regularizers. Compared to the state-of-the-art sparse attack schemes, we show that the proposed method can significantly decrease the time needed to design the attack, while the perturbation distortion is unchanged or reduced in some cases. © 2023 Elsevier Ltd",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85175555427&doi=10.1016%2fj.engappai.2023.107360&partnerID=40&md5=2d25eac86a5089f5b5a47616d0ac2abe,Engineering Applications of Artificial Intelligence,2024
Game-Theoretic Human-Machine Shared Steering Control Strategy under Extreme Conditions,"Human-machine shared control is a necessary transitional stage from manual to fully autonomous driving. A novel game-theoretic shared control strategy is proposed to ensure driving safety under extreme conditions. Specifically, a differential game framework is employed to mathematically model the dynamic human-machine interaction. The shared controller is developed based on the nonlinear vehicle dynamics and model predictive control (MPC). The piecewise affine (PWA) approach is utilized to linearly approximate the vehicle system and derive the Nash equilibrium solution of the game problem. Furthermore, a linear weighted shared driving strategy is designed to dynamically allocate the driving weight based on the level of driving risk and human-machine conflict. Simulation results in extreme conditions verify that the shared control strategy can fully exploit tire force to alleviate the driver's burden and compensate for the driver's misoperation, improving lateral stability.  © 2016 IEEE.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85174829013&doi=10.1109%2fTIV.2023.3322137&partnerID=40&md5=29910f10ca292087a69957cb22e9d6b2,IEEE Transactions on Intelligent Vehicles,2024
On the use of filament-based free wake panel methods for preliminary design of propeller-wing configurations,"With distributed propulsion and electric vertical take-off and landing aircraft on the rise, fast and accurate methods to simulate propeller slipstreams and their interaction with aircraft components are needed. In this work, we compare results obtained with a filament-based free wake panel method to experimental and previously validated numerical data. In particular, we study a propeller-wing configuration at zero angle of attack and the aerodynamics of the blade-resolved slipstream interaction with the wing. We use a prescribed wake on the wing and a free wake on the propeller, which greatly accelerate the computations. Results indicate that, while forces are overpredicted due to the inviscid nature of the panel method, the free wake is able to capture the slipstream deformation and shearing with remarkable success.

SynerFill: A Synergistic RGB-D Image Inpainting Network via Fast Fourier Convolutions,"Map inpainting is an important technology in the production of maps for autonomous driving vehicles. In recent years, scholars have often used methods such as point cloud inpainting, RGB image inpainting, and depth inpainting to repair maps. However, these methods require high computational power and result in longer algorithmic processing times.

Detection and Mitigation of Position Spoofing Attacks on Cooperative UAV Swarm Formations,"Detecting spoofing attacks on the positions of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) within a swarm is challenging. Traditional methods relying solely on individually reported positions and pairwise distance measurements are ineffective in identifying the misbehavior of malicious UAVs. This paper presents a novel systematic structure designed to detect and mitigate spoofing attacks in UAV swarms. We formulate the problem of detecting malicious UAVs as a localization feasibility problem, leveraging the reported positions and distance measurements. To address this problem, we develop a semidefinite relaxation (SDR) approach, which reformulates the non-convex localization problem into a convex and tractable semidefinite program (SDP). Additionally, we propose two innovative algorithms that leverage the proximity of neighboring UAVs to identify malicious UAVs effectively. Simulations demonstrate the superior performance of our proposed approaches compared to existing benchmarks.

On the Real-World Adversarial Robustness of Real-Time Semantic Segmentation Models for Autonomous Driving,"The existence of real-world adversarial examples (RWAEs) (commonly in the form of patches) poses a serious threat for the use of deep learning models in safety-critical computer vision tasks such as visual perception in autonomous driving. This article presents an extensive evaluation of the robustness of semantic segmentation (SS) models when attacked with different types of adversarial patches, including digital, simulated, and physical ones. A novel loss function is proposed to improve the capabilities of attackers in inducing a misclassification of pixels. Also, a novel attack strategy is presented to improve the expectation over transformation (EOT) method for placing a patch in the scene. Finally, a state-of-the-art method for detecting adversarial patch is first extended to cope with SS models, then improved to obtain real-time performance, and eventually evaluated in real-world scenarios.

Collaborative Honeypot Defense in UAV Networks: A Learning-Based Game Approach,"The proliferation of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) opens up new opportunities for on-demand service provision anywhere and anytime, but also exposes UAVs to a variety of cyber threats. Low/medium interaction honeypots offer a promising lightweight defense for actively protecting mobile Internet of things, particularly UAV networks. While previous research has primarily focused on honeypot system design and attack pattern recognition, the incentive issue for motivating UAVs' participation (e.g., sharing trapped attack data in honeypots) to collaboratively resist distributed and sophisticated attacks remains unexplored. This paper proposes a novel game-theoretical collaborative defense approach to address optimal, fair, and feasible incentive design, in the presence of network dynamics and UAVs' multi-dimensional private information (e.g., valid defense data (VDD) volume, communication delay, and UAV cost). Specifically, we first develop a honeypot game between UAVs and the network operator under both partial and complete information asymmetry scenarios. The optimal VDD-reward contract design problem with partial information asymmetry is then solved using a contract-theoretic approach that ensures budget feasibility, truthfulness, fairness, and computational efficiency. In addition, under complete information asymmetry, we devise a distributed reinforcement learning algorithm to dynamically design optimal contracts for distinct types of UAVs in the time-varying UAV network. Extensive simulations demonstrate that the proposed scheme can motivate UAV's cooperation in VDD sharing and improve defensive effectiveness, compared with conventional schemes. © 2005-2012 IEEE.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85174818083&doi=10.1109%2fTIFS.2023.3318942&partnerID=40&md5=75018162ec67995c64eee25f28b5afca,IEEE Transactions on Information Forensics and Security,2024
Non-Intrusive Security Assessment Methods for Future Autonomous Transportation IoV,"The security of the Internet of Vehicles (IoV) has always been a concern. The constantly changing IoV data under varying traffic conditions made it unsuitable for the IoV to adopt traditional anti-attack techniques. In the absence of protections, attackers can use in-car communication as a target to compromise the safety of passengers, hence the instancy to detect the security state of the IoV. However, currently available solutions require modifications to the original hardware of the IoV and are therefore very limited in applicability. In this paper, we propose a security assessment method for IoV based on Microcontroller Unit (MCU) chip temperature, called SAMCT. Specifically, we first record the MCU chip temperatures of IoV device in different security states and analyze the relationship between them. Second, the fingerprint dataset is built using the temperature residuals. Third, to forecast the security standing of IoV devices, an integration regression model based on Self-Encoders is suggested. Lastly, in order to facilitate the effectiveness of the SAMCT, a Cloud-Edge-End framework is designed with the technology of model adaptive partitioning. Results from the experiments, which were carried out on the Raspberry Pi 4B and Stm32 hardware platforms, demonstrate that the Mean Squared Error (MSE) of the SAMCT is only 0.00104 and that the execution efficiency improvement under the Cloud-Edge-End framework is significant.  © 2023 IEEE.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85173375040&doi=10.1109%2fTASE.2023.3316224&partnerID=40&md5=49e76c93c7d9fd4548a563637a302939,IEEE Transactions on Automation Science and Engineering,2024

ESUAV-NI: Endogenous Security Framework for UAV Perception System Based on Neural Immunity,"Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) represent an essential component of advanced intelligent equipment that can be used as an aerial perception system by installing various sensors such as vision, hearing, touch, taste, and smell to achieve intelligently integrated perception of environments. However, these perception system with environmental information may be threatened by various internal and external attacks, causing a great challenge to the security of the UAV. The original security system relied on an expert knowledge base to prevent attacks, but the weaknesses of lacking proactivity and flexibility are gradually exposed. The strong resistance and survivability of biological systems can be used to fill this capability gap and provide new ideas for the security of the UAV perception system. Therefore, an endogenous security framework (ESUAV-NI) based on the neural system and immune system is proposed in this article.

A Human-Machine Agent Based on Active Reinforcement Learning for Target Classification in Wargame,"To meet the requirements of high accuracy and low cost of target classification in modern warfare, and lay the foundation for target threat assessment, the article proposes a human-machine agent for target classification based on active reinforcement learning (TCARL_H-M), inferring when to introduce human experience guidance for model and how to autonomously classify detected targets into predefined categories with equipment information. To simulate different levels of human guidance, we set up two modes for the model: the easier-to-obtain but low-value-type cues simulated by Mode 1 and the labor-intensive but high-value class labels simulated by Mode 2. In addition, to analyze the respective roles of human experience guidance and machine data learning in target classification tasks, the article proposes a machine-based learner (TCARL_M) with zero human participation and a human-based interventionist with full human guidance (TCARL_H). Finally, based on the simulation data from a wargame, we carried out performance evaluation and application analysis for the proposed models in terms of target prediction and target classification, respectively, and the obtained results demonstrate that TCARL_H-M can not only greatly save labor costs, but achieve more competitive classification accuracy compared with our TCARL_M, TCARL_H, a purely supervised model - long short-term memory network (LSTM), a classic active learning algorithm - Query By Committee (QBC), and the common active learning model - uncertainty sampling (Uncertainty). © 2012 IEEE.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85148445264&doi=10.1109%2fTNNLS.2023.3236944&partnerID=40&md5=087710331f1cc0a744f14de8fc4640ba,IEEE Transactions on Neural Networks and Learning Systems,2024
Formation Control for an UAV Team with Environment-Aware Dynamic Constraints,"State-of-the-art literature on constrained multiagent system operations can only deal with constant or at best time-varying constraint requirements. Such constraint formulations cannot respond well to the dynamic environment and presence of external agents outside of the multiagent system. In this work, we consider a formation tracking problem for a group of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) in the presence of a physical attacker. The safety/performance constraint functions are environment-aware and dynamic in nature, whose formulation depends on certain path parameters and presence of the attacker. The dependence on path ensures adaptation to the dynamic operation environment. The dependence on the attacker ensures swift adjustment based on the relative distances between the attacker and agents. UAV desired paths and desired path speeds can also be both path- and attacker-dependent. Composite barrier functions have been proposed to address the constraint requirements. Neural network is used to approximate unknown attacker velocity, where the ideal weight matrix is learned by adaptive laws. Besides, unknown system parameters and external disturbances are estimated by adaptive laws. The proposed formation architecture can ensure formation tracking errors converge exponentially to small neighborhoods near the equilibrium, with all constraint requirements met. At the end a simulation study further illustrates the proposed scheme and demonstrates its efficacy.  © 2016 IEEE.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85164800979&doi=10.1109%2fTIV.2023.3295354&partnerID=40&md5=a5a96ede3d8379d8ca69154a74b7de4c,IEEE Transactions on Intelligent Vehicles,2024
Simultaneous Scheduling of Processing Machines and Automated Guided Vehicles via a Multi-View Modeling-Based Hybrid Algorithm,"The flexible job-shop co-scheduling problem (FJCSP) for processing machines and automated guided vehicles (AGVs) in a flexible manufacturing system (FMS) has attracted more attention with the aim of improving production efficiency. In FMS, AGVs in charge of transporting jobs realize the flexible linkage of operations between different processing machines. The added interdependence between transporting and processing tasks brings more difficulties than the traditional flexible job-shop scheduling problem (FJSP). In this paper, the mathematical model of FJCSP is formulated to minimize the makespan. Considering the feature similarity of FJCSP with FJSP and AGV-routing problem in different cases, a multi-view modeling-based hybrid algorithm consisting of an estimation of distribution algorithm (EDA) and an ant colony optimization (ACO) is proposed. In EDA, a probability model abstracts the information in superior solutions about the operation sequencing and the rule selection for scheduling machines and AGVs. In ACO, a job-path pheromone model and an AGV-path pheromone model are designed to jointly select the job-machine-AGV combination with shorter processing time and transportation time. In the proposed hybrid algorithm, EDA and ACO generate solutions independently and achieve cooperation by sharing elites. An adaptive parameter is designed to regulate the use of the two methods to adapt to the varying demands of multi-view modeling in different cases and search stages. Furthermore, a local search with a three-layer operator based on the critical path method is proposed to balance exploration and exploitation in solution space. Finally, computational experiments involving a case study verified the advantage of the multi-view modeling-based hybrid algorithm in comparison with the state-of-The-Art approaches. Note to Practitioners-This paper was motivated by the optimization problem of scheduling machines and automated guided vehicles (AGVs) in flexible manufacturing system (FMS). In FMS with AGVs, the transportation stages for jobs by AGVs significantly impact the overall production efficiency of the FMS and cannot be overlooked. This paper suggested a hybrid evolutionary algorithm using an estimation of distribution algorithm (EDA), an ant colony optimization (ACO) and a local search algorithm based on the critical path method. In the proposed hybrid algorithm, an adaptive parameter is introduced to regulate the utilization of EDA and ACO in generating a new population. This paper presents a mathematical characterization of the scheduling problem and subsequently outlines the step-by-step design of the hybrid algorithm. Computational experiments, including a case study, demonstrate that the hybrid algorithm exhibits adaptability to various instances and outperforms state-of-The-Art approaches.  © 2004-2012 IEEE.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85167804808&doi=10.1109%2fTASE.2023.3301656&partnerID=40&md5=85db322e87086ac2e2aa8564a9dc5cea,IEEE Transactions on Automation Science and Engineering,2024
Automatic Seabed Target Segmentation of AUV via Multilevel Adversarial Network and Marginal Distribution Adaptation,"The real-time segmentation results of side-scan sonar (SSS) images can realize the intelligent perception of autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs). However, there remains a compelling challenge that the models trained with training data may not generalize well in practical applications due to the various marine conditions/working devices. This article proposes a real-time cross-domain segmentation adaptation scheme for SSS images based on adversarial training via min-max training to distribute SSS images in the output space and marginal distribution adaption to improve the segmentation performance by minimizing the measured distribution distance. To further enhance the adapted model, the multilayer feature discriminators are established to realize the fine-grained alignment. Experiments on the real-world SSS datasets demonstrate that our proposed model outperforms state-of-the-art methods and achieves the actual industrial application for AUV.  © 1982-2012 IEEE.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85149379757&doi=10.1109%2fTIE.2023.3247737&partnerID=40&md5=9ab797efc95fdac25f808d507cadbc9c,IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics,2024
Explosive Cyber Security Threats During COVID-19 Pandemic and a Novel Tree-Based Broad Learning System to Overcome,"The rapid spread of the COVID-19 has not only affected personal health and economy, but also revolutionized people's lifestyles. As more people turn to work and socialize online, the development of unmanned technologies based on the Internet of Vehicles (IoV), such as unmanned delivery, unmanned vehicles, unmanned transportation, etc., will become an inevitable trend. However, all kinds of intelligent terminals for unmanned equipment require a large amount of data interaction with devices such as cloud servers, mobile terminals, and roadside terminals, which poses cyber security risks. Furthermore, the outbreak of COVID-19 has prompted people to put forward higher demands for the security of network communications. Unfortunately, the current intrusion detection methods based on machine learning still have weaknesses such as low accuracy and low efficiency when faced with unbalanced data distribution. To solve the above problems, we propose a novel Tree-based BLS (TBLS) intrusion detection method according to the idea of ensemble learning and decision tree (CART and J48). The performance of TBLS was tested on the NSL-KDD dataset and the UNSW-NB15 dataset respectively, which contain a variety of malicious traffic types for attacks on the IoV. The results show that our proposed method can achieve higher accuracy rate and lower false alarm rate, compared with the existing 16 solutions.  © 2000-2011 IEEE.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85127468845&doi=10.1109%2fTITS.2022.3160182&partnerID=40&md5=c5337d1334468300dd4bce45c2800836,IEEE Transactions on Intelligent Transportation Systems,2024
Event-Triggered Adaptive Bipartite Secure Consensus Asymptotic Tracking Control for Nonlinear MASs Subject to DoS Attacks,"This paper proposes an adaptive bipartite secure consensus asymptotic tracking control scheme based on event-triggered strategy for the nonlinear multi-agent systems (MASs) under denial-of-service (DoS) attacks. First, by incorporating the concept of shortest path into the hierarchical algorithm, the bipartite consensus control problem in the presence of unbalanced communication topology is successfully addressed. Further, an anti-attack bipartite control strategy by designing the improved forms of the tracking errors and virtual controllers is proposed under DoS attacks. Then, a modified event-triggered mechanism based on the relative threshold strategy is proposed, which can ensure that the bipartite consensus tracking errors converge to zero asymptotically by utilizing the Barbalat's Lemma. Under the Lyapunov stability theory, it is guaranteed that the outputs of all agents can reach agreement with an identical magnitude but opposite signs and all the signals of the closed-loop MASs are bounded. Finally, the simulation results on the model of damping pendulums are given to verify the efficiency of the proposed secure controller. Note to Practitioners-In this paper, the adaptive bipartite secure consensus asymptotic tracking control problem is considered for nonlinear MASs subject to DoS attacks, whose models can describe many critical applications, such as bidirectional formation of unmanned vehicles and robots. The research on the secure tracking control problem will be rather complicated yet challenging if the DoS attacks of the communication channels are taken into account in the insecure complex network environment. In addition, the event-triggered mechanism is used to reduce the usage of communication resources, which makes the proposed control scheme more easier to implement and more friendly for control engineers.  © 2004-2012 IEEE.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85163550610&doi=10.1109%2fTASE.2023.3286794&partnerID=40&md5=33f0d3f70f54c29b7d23fcde1fef2494,IEEE Transactions on Automation Science and Engineering,2024
Robust Trajectory and Offloading for Energy-Efficient UAV Edge Computing in Industrial Internet of Things,"Efficient data processing and computation are essential for the Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) to empower various applications, which can be significantly bottlenecked by the limited energy capacity and computation capability of the IIoT nodes. In this article, we employ an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) as an edge server to assist IIoT data processing, while considering the practical issue of UAV jittering. Specifically, we propose a joint design on trajectory and offloading strategies to minimize energy consumption due to local and edge computation, as well as data transmission. We particularly address UAV jittering that induces Gaussian-distributed uncertainties associated with flying waypoints, resulting in probabilistic-form flying speed and data offloading constraints. We exploit the Bernstein-type inequality to reformulate the constraints in deterministic forms and decompose the energy minimization to solve for trajectory and offloading separately within an alternating optimization framework. The subproblems are then tackled with the successive convex approximation technique. Simulation results show that our proposal strictly guarantees robustness under uncertainties and effectively reduces energy consumption as compared with the baselines.  © 2005-2012 IEEE.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85151320327&doi=10.1109%2fTII.2023.3256375&partnerID=40&md5=7e9870fbd75513930df67a7763f8955a,IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics,2024
3D Trajectory Optimization for Multimission UAVs in Smart City Scenarios,"There is a definite possibility that, in a recent future, Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) will form the backbone of any smart city in terms of automation and networking. One approach to extend the UAVs' resources spectrum is to provide a mean for them to opportunistically recharge and connect to otherwise unreachable networks: provide Training and Recharge Areas (TRAs). In these dedicated areas, the UAVs could dock to Energy and Data Dispensers (EDD) devices to resupply their batteries and exploit a high-speed connection. To autonomously move through the smart city while accomplishing a set of given tasks but, at the same time, consider visiting the EDDs, is part of a tridimensional trajectory planning problem that needs to be addressed. In this paper, we formally define the combinatorial optimization problem representing the trajectory planning. We consider the case in which more than one UAV can be connected with the same EDD at the same time, by properly addressing the assignment of the bandwidth. Through simulative investigation, realistic values for the solution of the optimization problem are found. The behavior of the proposed model is compared with an 'online' approach that does not require the same resources and knowledge and whose evaluation and comparison with the 'offline' approach are performed through network simulation. © 2002-2012 IEEE.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85140733690&doi=10.1109%2fTMC.2022.3215705&partnerID=40&md5=ed69b6fb3aa3ad4d19769f358e49bf12,IEEE Transactions on Mobile Computing,2024
Hierarchical Traffic Management of Multi-AGV Systems With Deadlock Prevention Applied to Industrial Environments,"This paper concerns the coordination and the traffic management of a group of Automated Guided Vehicles (AGVs) moving in a real industrial scenario, such as an automated factory or warehouse. The proposed methodology is based on a three-layer control architecture, which is described as follows: 1) the Top Layer (or Topological Layer) allows to model the traffic of vehicles among the different areas of the environment; 2) the Middle Layer allows the path planner to compute a traffic sensitive path for each vehicle; 3) the Bottom Layer (or Roadmap Layer) defines the final routes to be followed by each vehicle and coordinates the AGVs over time. In the paper we describe the coordination strategy we propose, which is executed once the routes are computed and has the aim to prevent congestions, collisions and deadlocks. The coordination algorithm exploits a novel deadlock prevention approach based on time-expanded graphs. Moreover, the presented control architecture aims at grounding theoretical methods to an industrial application by facing the typical practical issues such as graphs difficulties (load/unload locations, weak connections,⋯), a predefined roadmap (constrained by the plant layout), vehicles errors, dynamical obstacles, etc. In this paper we propose a flexible and robust methodology for multi-AGVs traffic-aware management. Moreover, we propose a coordination algorithm, which does not rely on ad hoc assumptions or rules, to prevent collisions and deadlocks and to deal with delays or vehicle motion errors.  © 2023 IEEE.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85161033336&doi=10.1109%2fTASE.2023.3276233&partnerID=40&md5=af737fb7c9971ea16bf537d46a859831,IEEE Transactions on Automation Science and Engineering,2024
Joint Optimization for Covert Communications in UAV-Assisted NOMA Networks,"In this article, we investigate the design of the trajectory of an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) and the transmit power of ground users to improve covert communications against a flying warden in UAV-assisted non-orthogonal multiple access networks, where the legitimate UAV can simultaneously collect the messages from the multiple ground users in a secure manner. Taking the channel uncertainty into account, we derive the analytical expressions of the optimal normalized detection threshold, the minimum detection error probability (DEP), and the security-guaranteed transmit power constraint for the ground users that are exploited to ensure a high DEP at the warden UAV. Subsequently, the design to maximize the average covert achievable rate (CAR) subject to the constraints of flight speed, initial and final locations, transmit power, and detection performance is formulated as a non-convex optimization problem. To obtain a high-quality solution to the design problem at hand, an iterative block coordinate descent-based successive convex approximation method is proposed. From the theoretical analysis, we find that a greater channel estimation uncertainly or a lower effective received power ratio at the warden UAV is beneficial in enhancing the system covertness towards the warden UAV. Moreover, when the successful detection probability of the warden UAV is sufficiently small, the maximum effective received power ratio is linearly and positively correlated to the detection success probability. Besides, extensive simulations are presented to verify the covert performance advantages brought by the proposed method.  © 1967-2012 IEEE.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85168712348&doi=10.1109%2fTVT.2023.3308718&partnerID=40&md5=8acd934a049a33041f60392d996f0e5b,IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology,2024
Fully Distributed Hierarchical et Intrusion-and Fault-Tolerant Group Control for MASs with Application to Robotic Manipulators,"This paper studies group synchronization tracking problem for a class of high-order multi-agent systems (MASs) with nonidentical and unknown direction faults (NUDFs) under multiple cyber attacks (i.e., denial-of-service (DoS) attacks and false data injection attacks (FDIAs)). Be motivated by this, a fully distributed hierarchical (cyber layer and physical layer) Zeno-free event-triggered (ET) intrusion-and fault-tolerant controller is presented based on Nussbaum-type gain technique, where a positive inter-event time exists in the state-dependent asynchronous ET mechanism (ETM). The constructed virtual cyber layer realizes the interaction among different agents so as to avoid the interaction in physical processes and thus reduce the error propagation. This two layer controller greatly increase the flexibility of the controller design compared with single-layer control strategies. In addition, a novel Nussbaum function stability lemma (Lemma 4) is developed for the first time. Based on this lemma, the fully distributed adaptive controller can adjust the direction of the input to match the fault direction with the help of Nussbaum function. Finally, a robotic manipulator example demonstrates the effectiveness and merit of the proposed control scheme.Note to Practitioners-In industrial processes, NUDFs and cyber attacks often occur in many different systems, which usually lead to performance degradation or even serious accidents. Typically, NUDFs affect the performance of chemical and industrial processes, circuits, and sensors. Meanwhile, in driverless vehicle platoon, attackers change the control signal through the wireless network, and then issue emergency braking commands, etc. Therefore, this paper designs a fully distributed hierarchical ET intrusion-and fault-tolerant scheme for high-order MASs that are usually used to model ship dynamics, robotic manipulators, and quarter-car active suspension. The control scheme gives solutions to the problem of NUDFs, multiple cyber attacks, and network bandwidth limitations at different layers, and effectively integrates the physical and cyber layers to achieve group synchronization. Meanwhile, a new event-triggered mechanism under the framework of group synchronization is developed to save communication resources. Robotic manipulator simulation studies verify the validity of the proposed scheme.  © 2004-2012 IEEE.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85159824827&doi=10.1109%2fTASE.2023.3270489&partnerID=40&md5=7af017bdbfa8630354fdd346301d9ee7,IEEE Transactions on Automation Science and Engineering,2024
An Effective Dynamic Constrained Two-Archive Evolutionary Algorithm for Cooperative Search-Track Mission Planning by UAV Swarms in Air Intelligent Transportation,"Target search, localization and tracking by unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) swarms have attracted much attention recently in research and industrial applications. Consequently, there is a high demand for effective mission planning methods for UAV swarms in air transportation. However, it's difficult to obtain the real-time mission planning in the uncertain dynamic environment. In response to tackle the problem, we model the mission planning problem in the uncertain dynamic environment as a dynamic multi-constraint and multi-objective optimization problems (DMCMOP) and propose the dynamic constrained two-archive evolutionary algorithm (DCTAEA) to realize the efficient mission planning. The proposed method can reconstruct the convergence archive (CA) and the diversity archive (DA) adaptively, and introduce the dynamic self-adaptive penalty mechanism into the CA updating, DA updating and the mating selection, which utilizes valuable infeasible solutions and promote population convergence. Consequently, the proposed algorithm can balance convergence, diversity and feasibility simultaneously. Comprehensive experiments on the real scenes and benchmark problem demonstrate that, compared with state-of-the-art algorithms, the proposed algorithm has the superiority and effectiveness.  © 2000-2011 IEEE.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85165914273&doi=10.1109%2fTITS.2023.3295401&partnerID=40&md5=85e5011a7ce5e7fa6d2e39e780cd7373,IEEE Transactions on Intelligent Transportation Systems,2024
Evaluation Framework for Electric Vehicle Security Risk Assessment,"Electric Vehicles (EVs) seem promising for future transportation to solve environmental concerns and energy management problems. According to Reuters, global car makers plan to invest over half a billion in more efficient and intelligent EVs and batteries. However, there are several challenges in EV mass production, including cybersecurity. Due to the cyber-physical nature of EVs and charging stations, their security and trustworthiness are ongoing challenges. In this study, we identify gaps in the security profiling of EVs and categorize them into five components: 1) charging station security, 2) information privacy, 3) software security, 4) connected vehicle security, and 5) autonomous driving security. Our study provides a comprehensive analysis of identified vulnerabilities, threats, challenges and attacks for different EV security aspects, along with their possible surface/subsurface and countermeasures. We develop a comprehensive security risk assessment framework by first using EV security profiles and mapping identified vulnerabilities to a well-known threat model, STRIDE. Then, we classify the risk levels associated with each vulnerability by setting ground criteria for the impact and likelihood of the threats. Finally, we validate our risk assessment framework by applying the same criteria to eight real-world EV attack scenarios. As a result, researchers can adapt the proposed risk assessment framework to discover threats and assess their risks in EVs and charging station ecosystems.  © 2000-2011 IEEE.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85171780829&doi=10.1109%2fTITS.2023.3307660&partnerID=40&md5=c9c04212a17e55a66be4193487f56ba7,IEEE Transactions on Intelligent Transportation Systems,2024
Deep Attention Recognition for Attack Identification in 5G UAV Scenarios: Novel Architecture and End-to-End Evaluation,"Despite the robust security features inherent in the 5G framework, attackers will still discover ways to disrupt 5G unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) operations and decrease UAV control communication performance in Air-to-Ground (A2G) links. Operating under the assumption that the 5G UAV communications infrastructure will never be entirely secure, we propose Deep Attention Recognition (DAtR) as a solution to identify attacks based on a small deep network embedded in authenticated UAVs. Our proposed solution uses two observable parameters: the Signal to Interference plus Noise Ratio (SINR) and the Received Signal Strength Indicator (RSSI) to recognize attacks under Line-of-Sight (LoS), Non-Line-of-Sight (NLoS), and a probabilistic combination of the two conditions. Several attackers are located in random positions in the tested scenarios, while their power varies between simulations. Moreover, terrestrial users are included in the network to impose additional complexity on attack detection. Additionally to the application and deep network architecture, our work innovates by mixing both observable parameters inside DAtR and adding two new pre-processing and post-processing techniques embedded in the deep network results to improve accuracy. We compare several performance parameters in our proposed Deep Network. For example, the impact of Long Short-Term-Memory (LSTM) and Attention layers in terms of their overall accuracy, the window size effect, and test the accuracy when only partial data is available in the training process. Finally, we benchmark our deep network with six widely used classifiers regarding classification accuracy. The eXtreme Gradient Boosting (XGB) outperforms all other algorithms in the deep network, for instance, the three top scoring algorithms: Random Forest (RF), CatBoost (CAT), and XGB obtain mean accuracy of 83.24 %, 85.60 %, and 86.33% in LoS conditions, respectively. When compared to XGB, our algorithm improves accuracy by more than 4% in the LoS condition (90.80% with Method 2) and by around 3% in the short-distance NLoS condition (83.07% with Method 1).  © 1967-2012 IEEE.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85167841335&doi=10.1109%2fTVT.2023.3302814&partnerID=40&md5=82d0b0642a61110163c0fd3499ce9543,IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology,2024
Vehicle Motion Control beyond and Within the Stability Limits for 4WD Electric Vehicles,"Autonomous vehicles with controllers capable of tracking path and speed in the largest possible operational domain, i.e., beyond and within the stability limits, provide significant safety potential. Dual-motor 4WD electric vehicles (EVs), a configuration already in mass production, can enable speed control when operating beyond the stability limits. This article presents a dynamic inversion-based path/speed tracking control law for this drivetrain topology, solving the nonlinear model inversion in a less computationally troublesome iterative way. The characteristics of vehicle input couplings are exploited to make this unified controller comprehensibly track the desired sideslip only when the sideslip dynamic is unstable. To allow the potentials of 4WD EVs to be fully unleashed, the prioritisation between path-tracking and yaw stabilisation, and the lower bounds of speed when the vehicle operates beyond the limits, are discussed. The framework is then validated in simulation for a reference path with both slowly changing segments and highly dynamic segments.  © 2016 IEEE.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85171578969&doi=10.1109%2fTIV.2023.3312318&partnerID=40&md5=b791dd53d8dd49f635ecdd0216f98875,IEEE Transactions on Intelligent Vehicles,2024
Scalable-MADDPG-Based Cooperative Target Invasion for a Multi-USV System,"This article concentrates on proposing a scalable deep reinforcement learning (DRL) method for a multiple unmanned surface vehicle (multi-USV) system to operate cooperative target invasion. The multi-USV system, which is made up of multiple invaders, needs to invade target areas in a specified time. A novel scalable reinforcement learning (RL) method called Scalable-MADDPG is proposed for the first time. In this method, the scale of the multi-USV system can be changed at any time without interrupting the training process. Then, to mitigate the policy oscillation after applying Scalable-MADDPG, a bi-directional long-short-term memory (Bi-LSTM) network is constructed. Moreover, an improved ϵ-greedy strategy is proposed to help balance the exploration and exploitation in RL. Furthermore, to enhance the robustness of the optimal policy, Ornstein-Uhlenbeck (OU) noise is added in this improved ϵ-greedy strategy during the training process. Finally, the scalable RL method is used to help the multi-USV system perform cooperative target invasion under complex marine environments. The effectiveness of Scalable-MADDPG is demonstrated through three experiments.  © 2012 IEEE.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85171566744&doi=10.1109%2fTNNLS.2023.3309689&partnerID=40&md5=e6e1695c8f78c4c50c484cdfc09a498d,IEEE Transactions on Neural Networks and Learning Systems,2024
A Car-Following Model Considering Missing Data Based on TransGAN Networks,"Car-following behavior is closely related to the longitudinal control of the vehicle, affecting the safety of the vehicle and traffic flow stability. In order to interact with the preceding vehicle, the target vehicle usually collects the driving data of the preceding vehicle. However, data acquisition devices often face malfunctions caused by various unpredictable disruptions, resulting in missing value problems. This may cause the target vehicle to make wrong control decisions. Given this situation, a new car-following(CF) model considering missing data based on Transformer-Generative Adversarial Networks (TransGAN) is proposed. Firstly, Transformer Network with multi-head attention is used to deeply extract the potential features from incomplete vehicle state data, which can filter important information from the input and focus on these, while capturing long distance dependencies. Secondly, a Generative Adversarial Network is constructed. The Generator generates the future multi-step control states of the target vehicle based on the features extracted by Transformer Network. The Discriminator with a fully connected network is applied to simultaneously ensure the generation accuracy. Finally, our proposed model was trained and tested on a publicly available NGSIM I-80 dataset. Compared with other existing advanced works, our model can fit the actual control states of the target vehicle with higher accuracy under different data missing rates of the preceding vehicle, which demonstrates that the proposed method effectively improves the robustness of vehicle longitudinal car-following control under missing data.  © 2016 IEEE.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85159642265&doi=10.1109%2fTIV.2023.3270336&partnerID=40&md5=45290c3061cc09b19b50a7862acdcadb,IEEE Transactions on Intelligent Vehicles,2024
Fully Distributed Secure State Estimation for Nonlinear Multi-Agent Systems Against DoS Attacks: An Edge-Pinning-Based Method,"This paper investigates the fully distributed secure state estimation problem of nonlinear multi-Agent systems (MASs) against denial-of-service (DoS) attacks. The design of state observer depends on the relative measurement outputs between neighboring agents rather than the absolute ones of agents themselves. To cooperatively estimate system states with the influence of DoS attacks in a fully distributed scenario, an edge-pinning-based synchronous update strategy for coupling weights is proposed. The purpose of adopting edge pinning method is to adjust partial coupling weights between neighboring agents instead of all ones, which can effectively reduce estimation complexity and save computing resources, especially for large-scale MASs. Further, an edge-pinning-based asynchronous update strategy for coupling weights is designed to meet different actual demands. Then, the security state estimation schemes under synchronous and asynchronous update strategies are proposed without utilizing any global information, such as the Laplacian matrix of communication graph or its smallest nonzero eigenvalue, and so on. Finally, a simulation example is provided to verify the theoretical results. Note to Practitioners-This paper addresses the distributed secure state estimation problem for nonlinear MASs, which plays an important role in unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) formation, intelligent transport systems, smart grids, and so on. The absolute measurement outputs of agents themselves are usually unavailable in practical situations, so the relative measurement outputs between neighboring agents are used to design observers. Moreover, to overcome the difficulty that global information is unavailable in industrial applications with DoS attacks, the edge-pining-based synchronous and asynchronous update strategies for coupling weights are proposed in a fully distributed scenario.  © 2004-2012 IEEE.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85165255069&doi=10.1109%2fTASE.2023.3293844&partnerID=40&md5=b605cd6a82c38f95c0ea89925afde162,IEEE Transactions on Automation Science and Engineering,2024
Hitchhiker: A Quadrotor Aggressively Perching on a Moving Inclined Surface Using Compliant Suction Cup Gripper,"Perching on the surface of moving objects, like vehicles, could extend the flight time and range of quadrotors. Suction cups are usually adopted for surface attachment due to their durability and large adhesive force. To seal on a surfaces, suction cups must be aligned with the surface and possess proper relative tangential velocity. However, quadrotors' attitude and relative velocity errors would become significant when the object surface is moving and inclined. To address this problem, we proposed a real-time trajectory planning algorithm. The time-optimal aggressive trajectory is efficiently generated through multimodal search in a dynamic time-domain. The velocity errors relative to the moving surface are alleviated. To further adapt to the residual errors, we design a compliant gripper using self-sealing cups. Multiple cups in different directions are integrated into a wheel-like mechanism to increase the tolerance to attitude errors. The wheel mechanism also eliminates the requirement of matching the attitude and tangential velocity. Extensive tests are conducted to perch on static and moving surfaces at various inclinations. Results demonstrate that our proposed system enables a quadrotor to reliably perch on moving inclined surfaces (up to 1.07m/s and 90°) with a success rate of 70% or higher. The efficacy of the trajectory planner is also validated. Our gripper has larger adaptability to attitude errors and tangential velocities than conventional suction cup grippers. The success rate increases by 45% in dynamic perches. Note to Practitioners-This paper was motivated by the problem of perching on moving inclined surfaces using quadrotors. It can be used for perching on the various angled surfaces of an automobile to save energy and enlarge flight distance. It can also be exploited in air-ground cooperative tasks. In recent years, various grippers and trajectory planning methods have been devised to enable quadrotors to perch on static inclined surfaces. These strategies can not be used for perching on moving inclined surfaces. The task poses high requirements for the efficiency of trajectory planning and the grippers' adaptability to pose errors. This paper proposes a real-time planning method to generate trajectories. The trajectories respect kinematic and motor lift constraints. They allow large attitude maneuvering of quadrotors. A multimodal search in a dynamic time-domain is developed to seek the minimum feasible time for the trajectory planner. Considering large pose errors in dynamic perching, a compliant gripper based on multiple independent suction cups is designed. The wheel and multidirectional layout of cups increase the adaptability to attitude and velocity errors. Results suggest that the proposed system is effective and reliable. In practice, our multiple cups would add weight penalty and increase the drag. The suction cups should be placed close to a quadrotor's central axis to reduce the drag and disturbance in flow. The proposed system relies on an external motion capture system. In future research, we will focus on onboard sensing and control methods to achieve perching on moving inclined surfaces outdoors.  © 2004-2012 IEEE.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85153349913&doi=10.1109%2fTASE.2023.3263558&partnerID=40&md5=2bd44052428f3ccda83b33b81be3ddf6,IEEE Transactions on Automation Science and Engineering,2024
Secure Event-Triggered Sliding Control for Path Following of Autonomous Vehicles under Sensor and Actuator Attacks,"Sensor and actuator attacks, which propagate the injected false data through CAN bus, make real threats to the security of the control of autonomous vehicles. This article attempts to solve the secure event-triggered path following control problem of autonomous vehicles subject to both sensor and actuator attacks. Firstly, a more general physical security model is established to characterize the impacts of sensor and actuator attacks on measurements and control actions. Then, feedback linearization method based on Lie derivative is exploited to linearize the established nonlinear attacked model. Thus, the nonlinear path following control is transformed into a linear case which will facilitate to the following networked-based analysis and design. Based on the established secure model, the event-triggered control scheme is utilized to alleviate communication burden under sampled-data control framework. Furthermore, the sliding control design is augmented to mitigate the malicious impacts caused by such false data injection attacks due to its inherent robustness to abnormal attack signal. Remarkably, the proposed secure sliding control can be plugged into the original control scheme rather than changing its existing control structure. Criteria for formal stability analysis and controller design are also provided and expressed in terms of some numerically tractable linear matrix inequalities. Finally, both simulation and experimental verification cases are shown to verify the composite control scheme.  © 2016 IEEE.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85161038139&doi=10.1109%2fTIV.2023.3278697&partnerID=40&md5=fffb7325b0fab27697ffb429903c1d12,IEEE Transactions on Intelligent Vehicles,2024
An Efficient Self-Evolution Method of Autonomous Driving for Any Given Algorithm,"Autonomous vehicles are expected to achieve self-evolution in the real-world environment to gradually cover more complex and changing scenarios. Reinforcement learning focuses on how agents act in the environment to maximize the cumulative reward, with a great potential to achieve self-evolution ability. However, most of reinforcement learning algorithms suffer from a low sample efficiency, which greatly limits their application in autonomous driving. This paper presents an efficient self-evolution method for any given algorithm based on the combination of Soft Actor Critic (SAC) and Behavioral Cloning(BC). First, the states of the sample trajectory in the replay buffer are separated and input into the given algorithm (algorithm with fundamental performance) to get the output label of actions such that the SAC algorithm can be guided using BC to achieve fast iteration in the direction of optimization with existing basic performance. Then, the value iteration algorithm is combined to achieve the proportion allocation of mixed gradient feedback, in order to trade off exploitation and exploration. In addition, the proposed methodology is evaluated in simulation environment taking automated speed control as an example. Experiment results show that compared with SAC algorithm, the proposed method can realize more than three times of convergence efficiency improvement, while without destroying the exploration enhancement advantage of reinforcement learning algorithm, that is, the performance is improved by 20% compared with the given algorithm (Intelligent Driver Model, IDM). The proposed method can easily extended to improve any given model no matter it is model-based or learning-based algorithm.  © 2000-2011 IEEE.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85171557312&doi=10.1109%2fTITS.2023.3307873&partnerID=40&md5=9726f8e26547b80dea44b337c1ca8992,IEEE Transactions on Intelligent Transportation Systems,2024
Pose and Shape Estimation of Humans in Vehicles,"As autonomous driving technologies advance, occupants are expected to be free from driving, diversifying interaction scenarios with vehicles. Despite the growing importance of in-vehicle occupant monitoring systems, most existing systems focus on the face or head tracking of occupants, and only a few studies have attempted to detect their poses. In this paper, we present the first in-vehicle environment-specialized framework for the joint estimation of 3D human pose and shape from a single image. To this end, we introduce a new dataset called Human In VEhicles (HIVE), which contains a large collection of synthesized humans with different shapes and poses in vehicle images. HIVE provides RGB and NIR in-vehicle image pairs with ground-truth 2D and 3D pose and shape annotations, respectively. In addition, to exploit the different characteristics of humans in vehicles and unconstrained environments, we present a new pose prior penalizing poses that deviate from in-vehicle poses. The pose prior is derived using a variational autoencoder trained with in-vehicle human pose data. By using the proposed HIVE dataset and pose prior along with an elaborately designed two-stage training procedure, our method exhibits significantly improved pose and shape estimation performance compared with state-of-the-art methods for real-world test images captured in vehicles under different conditions.  © 2000-2011 IEEE.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85168700915&doi=10.1109%2fTITS.2023.3306314&partnerID=40&md5=4e76fe286b3254c011a05c72cd2fe051,IEEE Transactions on Intelligent Transportation Systems,2024
Multi-Sensors Space and Time Dimension Based Intrusion Detection System in Automated Vehicles,"Recent developments in intelligence technologies have led to an explosion in the use of connected and automated vehicles (CAVs). Unfortunately, these autonomous vehicles face an increasing risk of vulnerability due to various attacks. Vehicle intrusion detection mechanisms are widely employed to mitigate the threats. Although some works have addressed this issue, few works consider situations that the attack detection may be fooled via simultaneous attacking multiple sensors. In this article, we propose a novel intrusion detection system integrated Space Dimension Model and Time Dimension Model based on sensor data fusion for countering both independent attack and confederate attack in automated vehicles. In Space Dimension Model, the correlations of multivariate in-vehicle sensor data among multiple sensors are utilized as the input of our optimized convolutional neural network (CNN) model. Especially, we construct vehicle state matrices to characterize the underlying correlation of data between each sensor and other sensors, and then input them into our network for classification. To describe the abrupt deviation caused by anomalous multivariate sensor data itself, we design Time Dimension Model to capture the sensor behaviors of vehicle state vectors at adjacent time by utilizing the Mahalanobis distance (MD) metric. Extensive empirical studies based on a real-world vehicular dataset demonstrate the effectiveness of our integrated anomaly detection mechanisms by a comparative analysis with two detection models that consider only Space Dimension and Time Dimension respectively. The method can outperform the related work under different scenarios 1) with the gain of up to 3.01% in accuracy and 3.04% in F1 score; 2) with ability of defending against confederate attack effectively.  © 1967-2012 IEEE.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85168752396&doi=10.1109%2fTVT.2023.3306345&partnerID=40&md5=06c4bdd190f245528eb7bc3826246ca2,IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology,2024
Underwater Motion Deblurring Based on Cascaded Attention Mechanism,"The images captured in the underwater scene frequently suffer from blur effects due to the insufficient light and the relative motion between the captured scenes and the imaging system, which severely hinders the visual-based exploration and investigation of the ocean. In this article, we propose a feature pyramid attention network (FPAN) to remove the motion blur and restore the blurry underwater images. FPAN incorporates the cascaded attention modules into the feature pyramid network, enabling it to learn more discriminative information. To facilitate the training of FPAN, we construct a weighted loss function, which consists of a content loss, an adversarial loss, and a perceptual loss. The cascaded attention module and the weighted loss function enable our proposed FPAN to generate more realistic high-quality images from the blurry underwater images. In addition, to deal with the lack of publicly available datasets in underwater image deblurring, we built two specific underwater deblurring datasets, namely Underwater Convolutional Deblurring Dataset and Underwater Multiframe Averaging Deblurring Dataset, to train and examine different deep learning-based networks. Finally, we conduct sea trial experiments on our autonomous underwater vehicle. Experimental results on two underwater deblurring datasets demonstrate that our proposed method achieves satisfactory results, which validates the potential practical values of our proposed method in real-world applications.  © 2022 IEEE.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85131572785&doi=10.1109%2fJOE.2022.3192047&partnerID=40&md5=bc62268a7a73c22f2c5ef9eea67caff6,IEEE Journal of Oceanic Engineering,2024
A Multilevel Electronic Control Unit Re-Encryption Scheme for Autonomous Vehicles,"Electronic control units (ECUs) connected by a controller area network (CAN) are used to perform various functions in modern vehicles. In the latest autonomous vehicles, redundant ECUs and a backup bus (different from CAN) are always equipped to prevent a single point of failure or network attack. However, due to the lack of protection measures of CAN bus, attackers can remotely intrude into the vehicle. Many schemes have proposed to use encryption to solve the security problem of CAN bus. Considering the current ECU storage space is limited, it is impossible to store all ECUs' keys. When a single point of failure or network attack against an ECU occurs, it is necessary for the backup ECU to process the messages related to the failed ECU. How to ensure that the backup ECU can decrypt the encrypted messages and at the same time securely isolates the backbone network from the backup network is an urgent issue to be solved. In order to solve the problem of forwarding and processing such messages under encryption conditions, we propose an efficient re-encryption scheme based on proxy re-encryption. The scheme is also suitable for cross-bus communication without backup networks. Burrows-Abadi-Needham (BAN) logic, random oracle model and Automated Validation of Internet Security Protocols and Applications (AVISPA) tool are utilized to prove that the scheme is secure. The scheme is simulated based on the MIRACL cryptography library on the computer and Raspberry Pi. The simulation results demonstrate that the proposed scheme is secure compared with the existing scheme.  © 2000-2011 IEEE.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85171802651&doi=10.1109%2fTITS.2023.3309817&partnerID=40&md5=b91fa8a586b364098e165b1f071342e1,IEEE Transactions on Intelligent Transportation Systems,2024
Autonomous Manipulation of an Underwater Vehicle-Manipulator System by a Composite Control Scheme With Disturbance Estimation,"This article addresses an autonomous manipulation problem for an underwater vehicle-manipulator system (UVMS) operating in a free-floating way while subjecting to unknown continuous disturbance. More specifically, a composite control scheme composed of disturbance observer (DOB), predictor model network (PM-Net), and nonlinear model predictive control (NMPC), is devised to improve the control performance of UVMS (i.e., unicycle-like UVMS actuated only in the surge, heave, and yaw for vehicle body) in the case of disturbance, model mismatch, and input saturation. A RBF-DOB is formulated by combining a DOB and a Radial Basis Function (RBF) neural network to estimate disturbance at the current step. Then, the PM-Network, composed of a disturbance predictor network and state predictor network, is developed based on long short-term memory (LSTM) network that predicts UVMS state sequences considering model mismatch and disturbance. The NMPC is deployed as a feedback control law to endow the input saturation of the UVMS and produce optimal control action. Compared with conventional DOB control methods using feed-forward compensation of disturbance, the primary merit of the proposed approach is that the disturbance estimated by RBF-DOB is utilized in the PM-Net to predict future UVMS state sequences, which are exploited on the NMPC's receding optimization. Finally, realistic simulation and relevant experiment are conducted to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method. Note to Practitioners - The motivation behind this article is the autonomous manipulation of an underwater vehicle-manipulator system subjected to unknown disturbance. However, it is not always feasible or straightforward to obtain the external disturbance and unmodeled dynamics for designing robust controllers. On the one hand, how to manipulate the disturbance into the designed controller to generate optimal control action rather than by using feed-forward compensation. On the other hand, the control input saturation often occurs in the UVMS control, especially under the disturbance rejection conditions, where it should be considered in the controller design. Currently, the predominant methods for UVMS control lack a control scheme that provides a complete and credible control strategy that takes the aforementioned issues into consideration. Motivated by the above analysis, this study provides a composite control scheme to deal with the dynamic uncertainties, unknown disturbance, and input saturation. The results of realistic simulation and relevant experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method. Hopefully, our control method can provide valuable theoretical and technical guidance to practicing marine engineers for controller design.  © 2004-2012 IEEE.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85147279477&doi=10.1109%2fTASE.2023.3236149&partnerID=40&md5=153d21c6351b76b9f89e915454ffbf07,IEEE Transactions on Automation Science and Engineering,2024
Fuzzy Finite-Time H∞Hybrid-Triggered Dynamic Positioning Control of Nonlinear Unmanned Marine Vehicles under Cyber-Attacks,"This article studies the fuzzy finite-time H∞ hybrid-triggered dynamic positioning (DP) control design issue of the nonlinear unmanned marine vehicles against cyber-attacks and ocean disturbances. The motion dynamics are firstly represented by the Takagi-Sugeno (T-S) fuzzy DP models. Secondly, for the purpose of obtaining the surge position, sway position, yaw angle and velocity of unmanned marine vehicles, a fuzzy state observer is proposed to estimate them.

Robust Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning Method Based on Adversarial Domain Randomization for Real-World Dual-UAV Cooperation,"A control system of multiple unmanned aerial vehicles (multi-UAV) is generally very complex when they complete a task in a closely-cooperative manner, e.g. two UAVs cooperatively transport a package of goods. Multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) offers a promising solution for such a complex control. However, MARL heavily relies on trial-and-error explorations, facing a big challenge in gathering real-world training data. Simulation environments are commonly used to overcome this challenge, i.e., a control policy is trained in a simulation environment and then transferred into a real-world system. But there often exists a gap between simulation and reality and thus a successful transfer is not guaranteed easily. The domain randomization method provides a workable way to bridge this gap. Nevertheless, the traditional one used in a policy training often suffers from slow convergence and results in an unstable decision policy. To address these issues, this article proposes an adversarial domain randomization method. It utilizes an adversarial generator as a 'nature player' to generate a more reasonable training environment so that the trained decision policy can deal with complex situations. Additionally, we improve the prioritized experience replay method by which we can sample those critical experiences, increasing the convergence speed of a training without decreasing the performance of the trained policy. We apply our method to a real-world task of dual-UAV cooperative transportation, and experiments illustrate its effectiveness compared to traditional ones.  © 2016 IEEE.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85168678669&doi=10.1109%2fTIV.2023.3307134&partnerID=40&md5=9aba98964c4c922574741b115f7657e9,IEEE Transactions on Intelligent Vehicles,2024
PDLC-LIO: A Precise and Direct SLAM System Toward Large-Scale Environments With Loop Closures,"As a key technology of autonomous driving, the high-precision vehicle localization is the prerequisite for automatic steer. With the advantage of accuracy and robustness, the Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR) is widely employed in Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM), which has been utilized to provide reliable positioning information. Compared with the experimental vehicles in the restricted laboratory driving circumstances, autonomous vehicles are devoted to actual roads and contain complicated activities, where closed loops can be noticed. In general, the accumulated error may be accumulated with the increasing of maneuver scope of SLAM. A distinct drift phenomenon may thus be incurred in the completed point cloud map and threaten the accuracy of positioning results. Focusing on this deficiency, a tightly-coupled LiDAR inertial odometry, named PDLC-LIO, is developed in this paper towards large-scale environments with close loops. A direct point cloud registration approach without extracting features has been introduced into this framework. Strategies including the pre-integration on the Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU), the direct scan match in local-scale, and an efficient fusion loop closure detection method with conditional detection are included to guarantee the precision. Also, the factor graph optimization is considered, and measurements from LiDAR odometry, IMU and loop closures can thus be integrated into the back-end optimization. The proposed method has been verified on both the public datasets and the test cases collected by our own autonomous driving experiment platform. Accurate experimental results can be obtained. Such results show that the performance including accumulated errors and the drift phenomenon outperforms the state-of-the-art algorithms LeGO-LOAM/ LIO-SAM /FAST-LIO2, and the loop closure detection rate can be promoted up to 75%.  © 2000-2011 IEEE.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85170540065&doi=10.1109%2fTITS.2023.3307439&partnerID=40&md5=ed2dbf864c22adf5b81b6a188cd917cc,IEEE Transactions on Intelligent Transportation Systems,2024
Cooperative Multi-Agent Jamming of Multiple Rogue Drones Using Reinforcement Learning,"The wide adoption and use of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) has created not only opportunities but also threats to the security of sensitive areas. Thus, effective and efficient counter-drone systems are required to protect these areas. This work tackles this issue by developing cooperative multi-agent jamming techniques using reinforcement learning (RL) to counter the operation of one or multiple rogue drones flying over a sensitive area. The aim of the proposed RL approach is to optimize the joint mobility and power control actions of the pursuer UAVs in order to maximize the received jamming power at the rogue drones aiming at disrupting communication links and sensing circuitry, while at the same time keeping the interference to surrounding pursuer agents below a predefined threshold. The effectiveness of the proposed approach in terms of scalability, learning speed, and agents' final joint performance is demonstrated through extensive simulation experiments for various agent and target configurations. © 2002-2012 IEEE.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-105002089728&doi=10.1109%2fTMC.2024.3409050&partnerID=40&md5=08b7cfb6d86d25da0f6422385cabe9a5,IEEE Transactions on Mobile Computing,2024
Causal Robust Trajectory Prediction Against Adversarial Attacks for Autonomous Vehicles,"Autonomous vehicles may mistakenly predict the future trajectories of neighboring vehicles when the trajectory prediction model is under attack. Recent works utilize adversarial training to mitigate the prediction errors of the trajectory prediction model under attacks. However, adversarial training exhibits high training costs and poor generality for different attack methods. Meanwhile, adversarial training improves the trajectory prediction performance under attacks by learning the adversarial examples, which leads to greater performance degradation in normal (without attacks) cases. In this article, to ensure the driving safety of autonomous vehicles, we propose a causal robust trajectory prediction method named CausalRobTra, which employs total direct effect (TDE) inference to defend trajectory predictors against adversarial attacks from the perspective of causal inference theory. First, we propose four directional metrics to evaluate the prediction errors of the trajectory prediction model under attacks. Then, we construct the causal graph of trajectory prediction under attacks and analyze the causalities among the nodes. Next, we conduct the counterfactual intervention on the history trajectory by replacing the history trajectory with the counterfactual trajectory to cut off the link between the history trajectory and the adversarial perturbation. Finally, we calculate TDE by subtracting the counterfactual prediction from the factual prediction to eliminate the impact of adversarial perturbation on the final prediction. Compared with the no-defense case, our method improves the performance by 13.4% under attacks and at the cost of 7.7% performance degradation on clean data. In addition, our method improves the performance by 20.6% on clean data compared with adversarial training and has a similar performance to adversarial training under attacks. Such an improvement can ensure the safety of autonomous vehicles under attacks and avoid many traffic accidents. Our CausalRobTra is a plug-and-play defense method that can be easily applied to any other trajectory prediction model. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method effectively improves the adversarial robustness of the trajectory prediction model under attacks at the expense of lower performance degradation in normal (without attacks) cases. © 2014 IEEE.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-105002089884&doi=10.1109%2fJIOT.2023.3342788&partnerID=40&md5=6655b3580c668cbf49398dbb00072e52,IEEE Internet of Things Journal,2024
An Anti-Congestion Interaction Mechanism Based Leaderless Formation Control for Unmanned Surface Vehicles With Communication Interruptions,"More credible communication reliability and more economical resource consumption are technological trends for multiple leaderless unmanned surface vehicles (USVs), while the realistic marine environment severely threatens system communication quality. Within this context, this paper investigates the leaderless formation control problem of USVs experiencing inter-vehicle communication interruptions. Concretely, by establishing the formation error system, the concerned leaderless formation control problem is tactfully transformed into the formation error consensus problem. Taking communication interruptions into account, a distributed controller is developed to achieve formation error consensus with intermittent inter-vehicle communications. Simultaneously, to endow the leaderless formation system with high economy, a novel intermittent dynamic interleaved periodic event-triggered mechanism (IDIPETM) is integrated into the controller synthesis, leaving the USVs to interact with each other only at preset periodic event-detecting instants. By assigning exclusive interleave bias to each vehicle, the proposed IDIPETM naturally eliminates the possibility that multiple USVs simultaneously broadcast information, thereby eradicating the communication congestion phenomenon inherent in the existing periodic event-triggered mechanisms. Finally, the theoretical analysis and simulation results are provided to evaluate the effectiveness and superiority of the proposed control scheme.  © 1967-2012 IEEE.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-105002090845&doi=10.1109%2fTVT.2024.3423478&partnerID=40&md5=cc18f5745aeef634c4c06246f6b18c0b,IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology,2024
All-Sky Autonomous Computing in UAV Swarm,"Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) play an essential role in emergency cases and adverse environments for applications like disaster detection and mine exploration. To process the massive volume of sensing data generated by various sensory payloads in these applications, existing works either compress deep learning (DL) models to conduct onboard computing, or offload raw data back to the resourceful ground station with the help of relay UAVs due to base station damage. However, the former sacrifices the inference accuracy of DL models (up to 10% accuracy loss), while the latter achieves high accuracy at the cost of significant latency, due to limited wireless communication resources in the multi-hop transmission. To address the problem, exploiting the resources of the UAV swarm including both task UAVs and relay UAVs, we build up an all-sky autonomous computing (ASAP) system to autonomously conduct collaborative computing in the swarm, to achieve both high accuracy and low latency of sensing data processing. In detail, we first propose a novel UAV swarm-native collaborative computing architecture, considering the general hierarchy and clustering structure of UAV swarms, as well as the characteristic of DL model execution. We then design an elastic efficient task scheduler to allocate computing tasks for UAVs, and update the scheduling scheme online when some UAVs are unavailable, with the aid of a lightweight and accurate DL inference performance predictor. Finally, we design an adaptive inter-UAV data compressor, to adapt to the limited and dynamic communication resources between UAVs. Experiment results on 24 airborne computers and five real-world UAVs show that, the proposed system can perform collaborative computing in a timely manner and effectively deal with situations when some UAVs become unavailable.  © 2002-2012 IEEE.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-105002089358&doi=10.1109%2fTMC.2024.3427420&partnerID=40&md5=0a68e994039eb9ea72fd460c83f82ae9,IEEE Transactions on Mobile Computing,2024
Ethical Decision-Making for the Inside of Autonomous Buses Moral Dilemmas,"The emergence of moral dilemmas inside autonomous buses can lead to unpredictable consequences for maneuver and amplify potential harms to passengers onboard. However, most existing approaches solely focus on ensuring ethical decision-making in scenarios outside of vehicles. To ensure ethical decision-making for autonomous buses when moral dilemmas occur inside, there are many urgent challenges that need to be addressed. First, the noncommensurability of ethical values presents difficulties in designing quantifiable environments and decision-making models. Moreover, ethical dilemmas involve multiple conflicting objectives, often necessitating the consideration of multiple moral theories to comprehensively evaluate different perspectives. Additionally, accurately representing these dilemmas and identifying optimal solutions that address conflicting objectives poses further challenges. This article proposes a general ethical decision-making system to handle ethical dilemmas inside autonomous buses. The system's design adheres to multiple ethical principles, and it comprises two stages: 1) develop a generative adversarial network (GAN) based human-value-aligned data collection scheme to gather representative moral values and generate comprehensive moral scenarios, which address the incommensurable ethical metrics issue; and 2) propose an ethical compliant multiobjective thresholded lexicographic Deep Q-learning method to ensure optimal policies that satisfy multiple ethical objectives. In a case study of autonomous bus route planning, our system outperforms benchmarks in showing a greater number and more evenly distributed policies in the Pareto Front and a 27% increase in coverage rate. Extensive experiments against nonethical systems show superior outcomes in convergence, average reward and cost. Finally, user studies demonstrate the system's accuracy and usability. © 2020 IEEE.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-105001208503&doi=10.1109%2fTAI.2024.3396415&partnerID=40&md5=1d9ea2b6a69727733434e2fb0923384a,IEEE Transactions on Artificial Intelligence,2024
MMPA: A modified marine predator algorithm for 3D UAV path planning in complex environments with multiple threats,"In this paper, we propose a modified Marine Predators Algorithm (MPA) for global optimization in complex environments with multiple threats, specifically targeting unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) path planning. Addressing the shortcomings of the original MPA, we introduce four innovative strategies, including adaptive parameter control, nonlinear inertia weight, Cauchy mutation operator-based randomization, and improved differential mutation strategy. These strategies not only significantly enhance the convergence speed while ensuring algorithm precision but also provide effective avenues for enhancing the performance of MPA. We successfully apply these modifications to UAV path planning scenarios in complex environments. To validate the proposed algorithm, we conduct comprehensive tests using 23 classical benchmark functions and compare its performance with six well-known algorithms. The experimental results demonstrate that MMPA excels in numerical optimization problems with various modes, exhibiting superior optimization performance. Moreover, in eight 3D Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) 22 path planning scenarios with diverse complexities, we demonstrate the superiority and robustness of MMPA in tackling practical problems.

Interval-valued fermatean fuzzy based risk assessment for self-driving vehicles,"The decision-making(DM) processes used by autonomous vehicle driving systems are separate from those of the users, allowing them to oversee and regulate the operations of the cars in expected and unforeseen circumstances. Although there are several advantages to using this technology, such as fewer accidents caused by human error and more efficient energy utilization, it is also evident that there are some risks involved. Hence, developing a risk assessment application for these systems will be advantageous given the hazards associated with autonomous cars and driving systems that must be tested and addressed. In this study, a new integrated FF-based MCDM methodology combining the Analytic Hierarchy Process(AHP), Technique for Order Preference by Similarity to Ideal Solution(TOPSIS), and Multi-Attributive Border Approximation Area Comparison (MABAC) methods is proposed as a new security model that will help decision-makers address the physical design and attack risks of autonomous vehicles, estimate their uncertainty, and control cyber risks Interval-valued Fuzzy Fermatean sets ten possibilities for autonomous vehicle driving systems assessed in the application based on six main criteria and fifteen sub-criteria.

Stealthy attack detection based on controlled invariant subspace for autonomous vehicles,"Autonomous driving offers a convenient and comfortable means of transportation, while the addition of external communication interfaces renders the vehicle communication more vulnerable to cyber attacks. In contrast to conventional attacks, well-designed stealthy attacks are more adept at evading conventional detectors. To address this problem, this paper proposes a robust detector based on controlled invariant subspace to identify stealthy attacks. This paper stands out not only by relying on the vehicle dynamics model for system state estimation, but rather by employing a real-time trajectory space generation method. Our detector develops a rapidly expanding random tree method based on offline incremental learning to generate trajectory subspace, and any trajectories that diverge from this subspace are identified as anomalies. Additionally, this paper designs distance measurement method that combines the linear quadratic regulation algorithm with a radial basis function neural network while also taking into account the vehicle's dynamic performance constraints. To assess the theoretical performance of the proposed detector, this paper presents rigorous proofs that demonstrate the asymptotical optimality of the generated trajectory and the robustness of the stealthy attack detection method based on controlled invariant subspace. Finally, simulation results demonstrate that the proposed robust detector can effectively identify stealthy attacks and outperforms advanced techniques in terms of accuracy and false-positive rate. © 2023 Elsevier Ltd",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85179130229&doi=10.1016%2fj.cose.2023.103635&partnerID=40&md5=48cc9c0614378f9de08f7a8b9badafe4,Computers and Security,2024
"IRS-Assisted Cognitive UAV Networks: Joint Sensing Duration, Passive Beamforming, and 3-D Location Optimization","In this article, to enhance the communication quality of cognitive unmanned aerial vehicle networks (CUAVNs), we investigate the intelligent reflecting surface (IRS)-Assisted CUAVNs, where a leading UAV (LUAV) is deployed for sensing spectrum and a group of following UAVs (FUAVs) transmit data to LUAV with the aid of IRS. Our objective is to maximize the achievable throughput of CUAVNs by jointly optimizing sensing duration, IRS passive beamforming, and LUAV's 3-D location, where LUAV's 3-D location is restricted by IRS, FUAVs, and primary user. For the IRS-Assisted single FUAV case, the intractable nonconvex optimization problem is resolved into three subproblems, which are solved by utilizing the bisection search method, the closed-form expression of the optimal IRS phase shift matrix and the successive convex approximation method, respectively. Finally, an efficient alternating optimization algorithm is developed to obtain a high-quality suboptimal solution. By exploiting the solutions of single FUAV, we further propose the throughput weighted sum (TWS) algorithm to solve the intricate nonconvex problem in IRS-Assisted multiple FUAVs case. To further reduce the complexity of TWS, the low-complexity location weighted sum (LWS) algorithm is proposed. Numerical results show that compared to the scheme without IRS assistance, the achievable throughput increases about 102% with the proposed single FUAV scheme, and over 88% with the proposed TWS-based multiple FUAVs scheme. Moreover, the performance gap between the low-complexity LWS and the TWS is less than 7%.  © 2014 IEEE.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85164669605&doi=10.1109%2fJIOT.2023.3293801&partnerID=40&md5=fb77d43c40a799ccd39aedbeb3d94890,IEEE Internet of Things Journal,2024
Dehazed Image Quality Evaluation: From Partial Discrepancy to Blind Perception,"Nowadays, vision oriented intelligent vehicle systems such as autonomous driving or transportation assistance can be optimized by enhancing the visual visibility of images acquired in bad weather conditions. The presence of haze in such visual scenes is a critical threat. Image dehazing aims to restore spatial details from hazy images. There have emerged a number of image dehazing algorithms, designed to increase the visibility of those hazy images. However, much less work has been focused on evaluating the visual quality of dehazed images. In this paper, we propose a Reduced-Reference dehazed image quality evaluation approach based on Partial Discrepancy (RRPD) and then extend it to a No-Reference quality assessment metric with Blind Perception (NRBP). Specifically, inspired by the hierarchical characteristics of the human perceiving dehazed images, we introduce three groups of features: luminance discrimination, color appearance, and overall naturalness. In the proposed RRPD, the combined distance between a set of sender and receiver features is adopted to quantify the perceptually dehazed image quality. By integrating global and local channels from dehazed images, the RRPD is converted to NRBP which does not rely on any information from the references. Extensive experiment results on both synthetic and real dehazed image quality databases demonstrate that our proposed methods outperform state-of-the-art full-reference, reduced-reference, and no-reference quality assessment models. Furthermore, we show that the proposed dehazed image quality evaluation methods can be effectively applied to tune parameters for image dehazing algorithms and have the potential to be deployed in real transportation systems. © 2016 IEEE.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85182943225&doi=10.1109%2fTIV.2024.3356055&partnerID=40&md5=1712cb8e17c1df7e0d18687c8c1650fc,IEEE Transactions on Intelligent Vehicles,2024
Secure Video Offloading in Multi-UAV-Enabled MEC Networks: A Deep Reinforcement Learning Approach,"Unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV)-enabled mobile-edge computing (MEC) has been widely applied in Internet of Things networks while the security risk of wireless computation offloading is still a challenging issue due to the openness nature of line-of-sight wireless channels between UAVs and edge devices (EDs). The existing secure offloading methods are not well targeted for video offloading in multi-UAV-enabled MEC networks since the joint potentiality of video distortion characteristics and multi-UAV flexible deployment in enhancing security is not exploited. In this article, we propose a secure video offloading strategy based on deep reinforcement learning (DRL) for a multi-UAV-enabled MEC system with a UAV eavesdropper. A joint optimization problem of resolution adjustment, offloading decision, computing capability allocation, communication resources orchestration, and multi-UAV position deployment is formulated to minimize system energy consumption under the constraints of offloading security, system latency, and users' quality of experience from the aspect of video frame analytic accuracy. Since the formulated problem is a high-dimensional nonlinear mixed-integer NP-hard problem, it is difficult to obtain the optimal solution via traditional optimization methods. To solve it, we propose a DRL algorithm (HRF-TD3) to instruct the agent to approach the optimal solution efficiently. The simulation results show that the proposed algorithm is superior to comparison algorithms in terms of system energy consumption, EDs' energy consumption, and system latency under the condition of wireless offloading security.  © 2014 IEEE.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85165246240&doi=10.1109%2fJIOT.2023.3296613&partnerID=40&md5=9b3a35c9a2b2c4a981f708f54dc3b37c,IEEE Internet of Things Journal,2024
Dynamic Event-Triggered Consensus Cost-Based Switching Control for UAV Formation with Disturbances,"This article focuses on the scene wherein some of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) are destroyed by enemy attacks or accidental crash, the number of plentiful UAVs will reduce, and the communication topology along with the formation construction will change. By calculating the global consensus cost of the UAV formation, a cost-based switching law is designed to determine whether the UAV formation is switched or not. As regards the limited capacity of the network bandwidth, this article designs a distributed dynamic event-triggered mechanism to alleviate the transmission burden. By taking the whole disturbances into account, distributed disturbance observers are established to eliminate the negative influence for each UAV. By means of Kronecker product technique, an integrated controller is conducted for each UAV, which can achieve the consensus for the formation switched system and compensate for the unknown disturbances. On these basis, a closed-loop system with the designed controller and switching law is proved to be exponentially stable. Additionally, the explicit expressions of the controller and disturbance observers gains are determined, respectively. Finally, a simulation based on the UAVs is performed to validate that the designed control algorithm is effective. © 2016 IEEE.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85181572370&doi=10.1109%2fTIV.2023.3344606&partnerID=40&md5=98f04b908e8c797e653f0fa012049411,IEEE Transactions on Intelligent Vehicles,2024
Stealthy Attack on Remote Control System with Local Controller and Its Countermeasures,"Cyber-physical systems (CPSs) driven by a local controller and a remote controller have been gaining significant research interest in recent years due to its application scenarios in practice, such as unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs). In this article, we consider the security issue in the remote control system with a local controller under stealthy attacks. Under this framework, one controller is designed locally based on the limited measurements collected by a local sensor, and the other controller is designed remotely and is transmitted to the actuator through a wireless communication channel, which may suffer malicious attacks due to its openness. To defend attacks on remote control signal, the K-L divergence-based detector or χ ^2 detector is often adopted. However, there may be attackers adopting stealthy attacks, which can bypass such detectors. Therefore, we analyze the existence of such attacks, and analytically characterize the worst-estimation performance degradation induced by the remote control signal attack. Further, we construct the optimal attack signal to achieve the upper bound on the estimation performance degradation. In addition, we also give countermeasures against such stealthy attacks. Simulations are provided to illustrate the proposed results.  © 2013 IEEE.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85181564235&doi=10.1109%2fTSMC.2023.3324366&partnerID=40&md5=79278ac67edad3aead14c4c608b8c106,"IEEE Transactions on Systems, Man, and Cybernetics: Systems",2024
Pilot Assignment and Power Control in Secure UAV-Enabled Cell-Free Massive MIMO Networks,"This article investigates the pilot assignment and power control (PC) problems for secure unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) communications in a cell-free massive multi-input-multioutput network with the user-centric scheme, where numerous distributed access points (APs) simultaneously serve multiple UAVs and terminal users. Meanwhile, there exists one UAV acting as an eavesdropper which can perform pilot spoofing attack. Considering a mixture of Rayleigh and Rician fading channels, the APs, respectively, perform minimum mean-square error estimation and distributed conjugate beamforming for uplink training and downlink data transmission. Using the random matrix theory, the closed-form expression for a tight lower bound on the achievable secrecy rate is derived, which enables the impact analysis of key parameters, such as power, antenna configuration, UAV height, etc. Taking into account both performance and complexity, a novel pilot assignment scheme is proposed by combining the weighted graphic framework and genetic algorithm, which can actualize global search with limited iterations. The max-min PC with security constraints is then studied in parallel, which can not only enhance the network fairness but also ensure the security. Accordingly, successive convex approximation and fractional optimization are jointly utilized to solve this nonconvex problem. Simulation results numerically verify the analytical results and indicate the superiority of the proposed pilot assignment and PC schemes.  © 2014 IEEE.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85165237166&doi=10.1109%2fJIOT.2023.3296736&partnerID=40&md5=e7de07a6b64784b51b9e1cee79d519ca,IEEE Internet of Things Journal,2024
Multiagent Reinforcement Learning in Controlling Offloading Ratio and Trajectory for Multi-UAV Mobile-Edge Computing,"In this article, a multiunmanned aerial vehicle-mobile-edge computing (UAV-MEC) network is proposed for mobile devices (MDs) located far from a terrestrial base station (BS)-MEC. In the UAV-MEC network, the MDs offload tasks to the UAV-MECs, followed by task offloading from the UAV-MECs to the BS-MEC. Each UAV-MEC aims to jointly optimize its energy consumption, queue stability, and the energy consumption of the MDs by controlling its trajectory and offloading ratio. Specifically, the trajectories of the UAV-MECs are controlled to locate themselves at the optimal positions where the transmission energy of the MDs is minimized. Additionally, the UAV-MECs consider the constraints of task processing time and queue stability in determining the amount of task to be offloaded. Thus, an independent proximal policy optimization (IPPO)-based offloading and trajectory control learning model (IM) is proposed to solve these problems, and a convex optimization model (CM) is also presented to show the optimality of the proposed IM. Specifically, in IM, a near-optimal trajectory control for the randomly located MDs is enabled by exploiting channel gain information only without resorting to accurate location information of the MDs. Furthermore, a dynamic offloading ratio control of each UAV-MEC is achieved by considering its queue dynamics. The simulation results show that the proposed IM jointly optimizes energy consumption and queue stability. Consequently, it outperforms other deep reinforcement learning (DRL)-based algorithms by achieving low energy consumption and long service duration. Moreover, it achieves similar performance to CM while requiring remarkably less time on action decision.  © 2014 IEEE.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85165254042&doi=10.1109%2fJIOT.2023.3296774&partnerID=40&md5=9f48364ccf9e9373c45be5f1d1b3cfe4,IEEE Internet of Things Journal,2024
TriBoDeS: A Tri-Blockchain-Based Detection and Sharing Scheme for Dangerous Road Condition Information in Internet of Vehicles,"Bad weather or environmental factors, particularly in remote mountain areas, may result in unsafe driving conditions and consequently road traffic accidents. As the deployment of large-scale sensing nodes for reporting road conditions is too expensive, the crowdsourcing method or reporting by sensors in vehicles themselves will be easier to deploy and more practical. However, those participant sensing methods impose some difficulties, such as fake information, reporter misbehavior, and timeliness. Thus, we propose a tri-blockchain-based Internet of Vehicles system, called TriBoDeS, to facilitate real-time information detection and sharing. It is designed to guarantee concurrency and security to dynamically store, manage, and share information uploaded by vehicles with great efficiency. Such information will be announced on the blockchain under the autonomous identification of vehicles in low-trust conditions. In order to ensure the software's security, TriBoDeS can monitor the software's state, detect identified malicious activities, and respond accordingly. To ensure data security, a role-based management mechanism is introduced to achieve fine-grained control over permissions, and confidence rules are established to guarantee the authenticity of the data. To demonstrate the applicability of the proposed scheme, we evaluate its performance (e.g., computing and communication overheads) and security (e.g., resiliency against common attacks) over a consortium blockchain. The experimental results demonstrate that, under the conditions of a sufficient number of vehicles, the TriBoDeS system is capable of real-time information sharing while ensuring the security of user information. Compared to conventional single-chain systems, the TriBoDeS system achieves a 2.75-time improvement in efficiency.  © 2014 IEEE.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85165343776&doi=10.1109%2fJIOT.2023.3297259&partnerID=40&md5=9fb0cfaf8780ec5754734fd71964cfc4,IEEE Internet of Things Journal,2024
Finite-Time Security Control of Networked Unmanned Marine Vehicle Systems Subject to DoS Attack,"The finite-time dynamic positioning controller design problem of the unmanned marine vehicle (UMV) system under switching DoS attacks is investigated. Firstly, an adaptive memory-based event-triggering communication mechanism (METCM) is designed to save networked resources in maritime environment. Second, the signals released by the communication mechanism are quantized to further reduce the bandwidth of the communication network. In addition, since adversary may have multiple attack strategies, thus a hierarchical semi-Markov process (HS-MP) is presented to capture the phenomenon of switching DoS attacks, which makes the attack model more realistic. Further, sufficient conditions are proposed for the finite-time boundedness (FTB) of the UMV system and some linear matrix inequalities are solved to determine the finite-time bounded controller gain. Finally, the effectiveness of the proposed control method is demonstrated by a simulation example. © 2016 IEEE.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85182364174&doi=10.1109%2fTIV.2024.3350246&partnerID=40&md5=568be1eb45c1a19bb8437f339c9a992d,IEEE Transactions on Intelligent Vehicles,2024
Vision-Based Topological Localization for MAVs,"Vision-based topological localization is recently emerging as a promising alternative to metric pose estimation techniques in robotic navigation systems. Contrarily to the latter, which suffer from a quick degradation of their performance under non-ideal conditions (e.g., scenes with poor illumination and low amount of textures), topological localization trades off precise metric positioning with a more robust and higher-level location representation. State-of-the-art works in this direction, however, often neglect the spatiotemporal relationships between poses that are naturally induced by robotic navigation. Furthermore, these techniques are nearly unexplored for autonomous flying platforms. Inspired by these considerations, in this work, we propose a vision-based topological localization approach designed for Micro Aerial Vehicles (MAVs) applications. Our strategy exploits the framework of graph recurrent neural networks to model the spatial and temporal dependencies and estimate the location of the robot with respect to a topological graph representing the environment. We demonstrate with experiments on different sets of scenarios, including scenes that considerably differ from those used in the training phase, that our approach is able to outperform state-of-the-art place recognition baselines.  © 2016 IEEE.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85179825563&doi=10.1109%2fLRA.2023.3341758&partnerID=40&md5=ffdb00e022a2a38199d96c1b9d0faf36,IEEE Robotics and Automation Letters,2024
Adaptive Coding and Modulation-Aided Mobile Relaying for Millimeter-Wave Flying Ad Hoc Networks,"The emerging drone swarms are capable of carrying out sophisticated tasks in support of demanding Internet of Things (IoT) applications by synergistically working together. However, the target area may be out of the coverage of the ground station (GS) and it may be impractical to deploy a large number of drones in the target area due to cost, electromagnetic interference, and flight-safety regulations. By exploiting the innate agility and mobility of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), we conceive a mobile relaying-assisted drone swarm network architecture, which is capable of extending the coverage of the GS and enhancing the effective end-to-end throughput. Explicitly, a swarm of drones forms a data-collecting drone swarm (DCDS) designed for sensing and collecting data with the aid of their mounted cameras and/or sensors, and a powerful relay-UAV (RUAV) acts as a mobile relay for conveying data between the DCDS and a GS. Given a time period, in order to maximize the data delivered while minimizing the delay imposed, we harness an $\epsilon $ -multiple-objective genetic algorithm ( $\epsilon $ -MOGA)-assisted Pareto-optimization scheme. Our simulation results demonstrate that the proposed mobile relaying is capable of delivering more data. As specific examples investigated in our simulations, our mobile relaying-assisted drone swarm network is capable of delivering 45.38% more data than the benchmark solutions, when a stationary relay is available, and it is capable of delivering 26.86% more data than the benchmark solutions when no stationary relay is available.  © 2014 IEEE.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85165256514&doi=10.1109%2fJIOT.2023.3296058&partnerID=40&md5=dae3d7136bbeec812404cde98e520c54,IEEE Internet of Things Journal,2024
LCPR: A Multi-Scale Attention-Based LiDAR-Camera Fusion Network for Place Recognition,"Place recognition is one of the most crucial modules for autonomous vehicles to identify places that were previously visited in GPS-invalid environments. Sensor fusion is considered an effective method to overcome the weaknesses of individual sensors. In recent years, multimodal place recognition fusing information from multiple sensors has gathered increasing attention. However, most existing multimodal place recognition methods only use limited field-of-view camera images, which leads to an imbalance between features from different modalities and limits the effectiveness of sensor fusion. In this letter, we present a novel neural network named LCPR for robust multimodal place recognition, which fuses LiDAR point clouds with multi-view RGB images to generate discriminative and yaw-rotation invariant representations of the environment. A multi-scale attention-based fusion module is proposed to fully exploit the panoramic views from different modalities of the environment and their correlations. We evaluate our method on the nuScenes dataset, and the experimental results show that our method can effectively utilize multi-view camera and LiDAR data to improve the place recognition performance while maintaining strong robustness to viewpoint changes. © 2016 IEEE.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85181569033&doi=10.1109%2fLRA.2023.3346753&partnerID=40&md5=48d2aebfa206167856c698df7d8eeaad,IEEE Robotics and Automation Letters,2024
On the Physical Layer Security of Automotive Dual-Function Radar-Communication Systems,"The automotive industry has witnessed flourishing development in the last few years with the hope of achieving fully autonomous driving. In parallel, dual-function radar-communication (DFRC) systems are being developed to tackle the spectrum scarcity challenge and integrate radar and communication transceivers into a unified system. However, with a DFRC system, critical information may be intercepted by unauthorized people in the target vehicle. Therefore, the physical layer security of the DFRC system needs to be given considerable attention. To improve the security of information transmission, artificial noise (AN) is used to interfere with eavesdroppers. The main objective of this work is to maximize the secrecy rate of vehicles subject to both radar signal-To-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR) and communication transmit power constraints. To overcome the difficulty caused by the existence of the nonconvex Shannon capacity formula in the formulated problem, we convert the secrecy rate optimization to an equivalent bi-convex optimization problem. Furthermore, due to the nonconvexity of the formulated design problem, we exploit an inexact block coordinate descent (IBCD) algorithm based on semi-definite Programming (SDP) to obtain the optimal solution. Moreover, to reduce the complexity of the SDP-based IBCD algorithm, a bi-search-based IBCD algorithm is employed for single target scenarios. Finally, numerical simulations are used to demonstrate the superiority of using the AN approach to enhance the performance of the DFRC system in terms of the secrecy rate.  © 2014 IEEE.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85166753843&doi=10.1109%2fJIOT.2023.3301771&partnerID=40&md5=5c1d61afb4b178b4893c91a1df3040cf,IEEE Internet of Things Journal,2024
A Location-Aware and Healing Attestation Scheme for Air-Supported Internet of Vehicles,"With the rapid technological advancement in the Internet of Things (IoT) and Internet of Vehicles (IoV), we witness exponential growth of Connected and Autonomous Vehicles (CAVs). However, these integrations of IoV with other technologies make the IoV network and its interaction between different network components highly complex. Therefore, ensuring the correct functioning of the firmware and software running on these next-generation vehicles becomes an essential requirement. A feasible method to address the aforementioned security issues is Remote Attestation (RA). However, the advancement in the attackers' approaches and the increased complexity, large network size, and vehicle mobility allow the attacks to bypass these security solutions, making RA less effective. In this paper, we propose LHASIoV, an attestation and healing protocol for IoV. LHASIoV has many features such as competent-wise (treats different entities of the system differently), geographical location-aware (traces forensics of security breaches and eases healing compromised vehicles), gradual healing (via slicing the healing software) of compromised vehicles, and resistance to single-point-of-failure. We provide proof-of-concept implementation and formal operational and security analysis for LHASIoV. To show its practical feasibility and effectiveness, we provide performance analysis by implementing it on the Omnetpp simulator. The simulation results show that for an IoV system that has 100 vehicles moving with a speed range of 15-25 mph, LHASIoV needed only 5.27 seconds to complete the vehicle's attestation. For this number of vehicles and compared to the existing protocols, LHASIoV reduced the communication and storage costs on average by 54.46% and 43.92%, respectively.  © 2000-2011 IEEE.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85174804147&doi=10.1109%2fTITS.2023.3316775&partnerID=40&md5=bf7f8af42378b16c02ceb76f3f6d587a,IEEE Transactions on Intelligent Transportation Systems,2024
In-Vehicle Digital Forensics for Connected and Automated Vehicles With Public Auditing,"Connected and autonomous vehicles produce a substantial amount of data that is essential for implementing advanced and intelligent features. Given the importance and the volume of in-vehicle data, storing it in the cloud for later extraction as critical evidence for vehicle digital forensics is a logical choice. However, ensuring the security of forensic data against tampering and forgery attacks throughout the process is a significant challenge. Existing solutions typically assume that vehicles will generate and upload the in-vehicle data to the cloud honestly. In reality, it may be necessary to prove whether the vehicle has uploaded authentic driving-related data in case of disputes about data authenticity. To address this issue, we propose an in-vehicle digital forensic scheme with public auditing, enabling anyone to perform a public auditing algorithm to check whether the data has been modified. The proposal is based on a process-oriented data integrity proof method that enables a vehicle to generate public verifiable integrity proof. Furthermore, we evaluated the practicality of our scheme by assessing its computational and communication overhead. In terms of computational cost, our proposed scheme demonstrates a power consumption of 0.0385 kWh per 100 km at a speed of 60 km/h. Regarding communication delay, our method exhibits a 50.1% decrease compared to similar approaches.  © 2014 IEEE.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85171583356&doi=10.1109%2fJIOT.2023.3310578&partnerID=40&md5=c60bacbf4c030cc89d3da0161a45e6ed,IEEE Internet of Things Journal,2024
"Privacy-Aware Remote Identification for Unmanned Aerial Vehicles: Current Solutions, Potential Threats, and Future Directions","The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) recently introduced a new standard, namely, remote identification, to improve accountability for unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) operations.

Unknown Threats Detection Methods of Smart Contracts,"With the explosive growth of blockchain platforms and applications, security threats of blockchain also occur frequently. As a decentralized application deployed on the blockchain, smart contracts help the blockchain realize safe and efficient information storage, asset management, and value transfer. Therefore, smart contracts play a vital role in the security of the blockchain. In recent years, security threats against smart contracts have increased, not only causing huge economic losses but also impacting the credit system of the blockchain. Therefore, many researchers have carried out corresponding research on the security threats of smart contracts. Common threat detection methods include formal verification, symbolic execution, fuzzing, etc. Most of these methods are only for known threats, while there is not much work on detecting unknown threats.

Secured and Cooperative Publish/Subscribe Scheme in Autonomous Vehicular Networks,"In order to save computing power yet enhance safety, there is a strong intention for autonomous vehicles (AVs) in future to drive collaboratively by sharing sensory data and computing results among neighbors. However, the intense collaborative computing and data transmissions among unknown others will inevitably introduce severe security concerns. Aiming at addressing security concerns in future AVs, in this paper, we develop SPAD, a secured framework to forbid free-riders and promote trustworthy data dissemination in collaborative autonomous driving. Specifically, we first introduce a publish/subscribe framework for inter-vehicle data transmissions. To defend against free-riding attacks, we formulate the interactions between publisher AVs and subscriber AVs as a vehicular publish/subscribe game, and incentivize AVs to deliver high-quality data by analyzing the Stackelberg equilibrium of the game. We also design a reputation evaluation mechanism in the game to identify malicious AVs in disseminating fake information. Furthermore, for lack of sufficient knowledge on parameters of the network model and the user cost model in dynamic game scenarios, a reinforcement learning based algorithm with hotbooting is developed to obtain the optimal strategies of subscriber AVs and publisher AVs with free-rider prevention. Extensive simulations are conducted, and the results validate that our SPAD can effectively prevent free-riders and enhance the dependability of disseminated contents, compared with conventional schemes. © 2000-2011 IEEE.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85190174742&doi=10.1109%2fTITS.2023.3315052&partnerID=40&md5=f0e2a8ea722f3ea0fc380ad69f1ec329,IEEE Transactions on Intelligent Transportation Systems,2024
Area Surveillance with Low Detection Probability Using UAV Swarms,"Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) deployed as a swarm can offer a flexible and cost-efficient solution for surveillance missions in large-scale adversarial environments. UAV swarms possess superior real-Time surveillance capabilities in detecting time-sensitive targets with speed and security, surpassing alternative techniques such as satellites and ground-based sensors. However, the area surveillance problem in adversarial scenarios using UAV swarms necessitates careful consideration of factors such as swarm positioning, flight attitudes, antenna directionality, the threat posed by adversary detection systems (ADSs), and swarm network topology. To address this challenge, we propose the Integrated Low Detection Probability (ILDP) deployment method for UAV swarms, which incorporates the Danger Avoidance Distributed Motion control algorithm (DADM) for swarm collaboration and the Low Detection Probability Topology Control algorithm (LDPTC) for swarm networking. The DADM algorithm facilitates swarm cooperation in achieving area coverage and evading ADSs by leveraging neighboring, environmental, and threat information in adversarial scenarios. Furthermore, the LDPTC algorithm establishes a topology optimization model that comprehensively considers swarm distribution and the impact of directional antenna sidelobes to reduce transmitting energy leakage on the ground. Our strategy significantly decreases the detection probability of UAV swarms by ADSs, ensuring the operational effectiveness of UAV swarms in dynamic adversarial scenarios. Extensive simulations validate the superiority of our proposed ILDP method, demonstrating considerably lower detection probabilities compared to other approaches in static and dynamic adversary environments across various swarm scales. Moreover, our method excels in real-Time surveillance capabilities with lower computational complexity, freeing up computing resources for UAVs to fulfill additional tasks.  © 1967-2012 IEEE.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85173013357&doi=10.1109%2fTVT.2023.3318641&partnerID=40&md5=7ec9e061591d2935dc02145f7855bef2,IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology,2024

Chassis Global Dynamics-Oriented Trajectory Planning for Automated Vehicles,"The trajectory planning module generates optimal collision-free paths, which is essential to automated driving. Existing approaches have focused on traffic flow situations and the geometrical feasibility of local trajectories. However, high nonlinearity of vehicle dynamics could cause handling instability or even severe accidents in cases of tracking dynamic infeasible paths. Meanwhile, the variety and complexity of driving environments bring intractable challenges to safe trajectory planning. This article aims to address this crucial issue and proposes a chassis global dynamics-oriented trajectory planning scheme. This work designs comprehensive performance indices to represent handling dynamic status based on chassis dynamics modeling. As the basis of trajectory planning, a reference path is extracted from global digital map data, and the curvilinear coordinate frame is exploited. Numerical optimization is proposed to solve the trajectory planning problem. Thus, an optimal and dynamically feasible trajectory, which satisfies geometrical smoothness, chassis global dynamics indices, and feasible safety, can be generated and transformed. Various scenarios are involved in carrying out simulation tests, and those results demonstrate the excellent capability and effectiveness of the proposed scheme to provide optimal trajectories in a variety of driving situations.  © 2013 IEEE.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85176318699&doi=10.1109%2fTSMC.2023.3321881&partnerID=40&md5=51bb9850b4bcd362d115cf58d2ae541f,"IEEE Transactions on Systems, Man, and Cybernetics: Systems",2024
Outage Performance of Multitier UAV Communication With Random Beam Misalignment,"By exploiting the degree of freedom on the altitude, unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) communication can provide ubiquitous communication for future wireless networks. In the case of concurrent transmission of multiple UAVs, the directional beamforming formed by multiple antennas is an effective way to reduce co-channel interference. However, factors, such as airflow disturbance or estimation error for UAV communications, can cause the occurrence of beam misalignment. In this article, we investigate the system performance of a multitier UAV communication network with the consideration of unstable beam alignment. In particular, we propose a tractable random model to capture the impacts of beam misalignment in the 3-D space. Based on this, by utilizing stochastic geometry, an analytical framework for obtaining the outage probability in the downlink of a multitier UAV communication network for the closest distance association scheme and the maximum average power association scheme is established. The accuracy of the analysis is verified by Monte Carlo simulations. The results indicate that in the presence of random beam misalignment, the optimal number of UAV antennas needs to be adjusted to be relatively larger when the density of UAVs increases or the altitude of UAVs becomes higher.  © 2014 IEEE.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85166305708&doi=10.1109%2fJIOT.2023.3299279&partnerID=40&md5=9686451d61d7e439a1a932cbbec8277b,IEEE Internet of Things Journal,2024
Context-Aware Meta-RL With Two-Stage Constrained Adaptation for Urban Driving,"End-to-end driving based on reinforcement learning (RL) has emerged as a promising approach in autonomous driving, with the potential to surpass human drivers. However, the exploration and exploitation dilemma of RL leads to low sample efficiency and high computational costs to train an optimal driving model, and the environment feedback-oriented learning mode limits the model's ability to handle unseen traffic scenarios, especially when dealing with the highly varied tasks of urban driving. In this article, we proposed a context-aware meta-RL framework with two-stage constrained adaptation for challenging urban driving. Firstly, the context-aware state representation enhanced by historical behavior is construct to improve the learning efficiency and robustness, where the most efficient context encoder is selected among four different forms. Next, the end-to-end meta-driving model with high generalization ability is built through the parallel rollouts of multiple tasks and simplified meta-training procedure. Then, a two-stage constrained adaptation strategy is designed to quickly transfer the meta model to new tasks while maintaining good performance, where the meta-training data are reused through the context-based propensity estimation to constrain the optimization objective of new tasks. Extensive experiments are performed in CARLA simulator with various urban scenarios, and the results validate the superiority of our proposed models in both learning efficiencyand generalization compared to state-of-the-art algorithms.  © 1967-2012 IEEE.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85171592302&doi=10.1109%2fTVT.2023.3312495&partnerID=40&md5=255ec662f11625de62b8200e7497fc28,IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology,2024
"A Mechanism to Localize, Detect, and Prevent Jamming in Connected and Autonomous Vehicles (CAVs)","One of the challenges in Connected and Autonomous Vehicles (CAVs) and Vehicular Ad Hoc Networks (VANETs) is jamming attacks. These attacks present safety concerns and may render the whole communication network ineffective. Designing an anti-jamming solution for CAVs and VANETs is non-trivial because every jamming scenario presents itself with unique characteristics. In this paper, we extend our previous work in Alam (2021) by proposing a scheme that localizes jamming vehicles, maps the jammed area, and prevents the jamming vehicles from sending and/or receiving beacons in the network. To achieve these objectives, we apply Centroid Localization (CL), Graham Scan Hull Algorithm (GSHA), and bloom filter data structure. The novelties of our work are three-fold. 1) We dynamically change the X, Y positions and radii of the jamming vehicles. 2) We implement multiple jamming attack scenarios with multiple jammers and varying number of vehicles. 3) We prevent the jamming vehicles from sending messages in the network. Simulation results show that on average, our model achieves an accuracy of 97.77%, a precision of 99.14%, a recall of 93.54%, and an F1 score of 96.03% for all the attack scenarios implemented.  © 2000-2011 IEEE.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85173049909&doi=10.1109%2fTITS.2023.3314737&partnerID=40&md5=3c68646aa04e1995d28989f53e39854a,IEEE Transactions on Intelligent Transportation Systems,2024
SegTransConv: Transformer and CNN Hybrid Method for Real-Time Semantic Segmentation of Autonomous Vehicles,"Real-time and high-performance semantic segmentation is a crucial task in the scene understanding of autonomous vehicles. This paper focuses on this issue and proposes a transformer and convolutional neural networks (CNN) hybrid encoder-decoder structure SegTransConv. Firstly, we present a four-stage hierarchical encoder, and the feature extractor in each stage is composed of two transformer layers and CNN modules in series. In this way, the encoder better exploits the global contexts of the input and expands the receptive fields. In the U-shape decoder, the feature maps are upsampled through the proposed feature enhancement upsampling module (FE_Up). Then the knowledge distillation strategy is leveraged to improve the model performance under the guidance of the teacher network STDCNet. Finally, a novel evaluation metric is designed to comprehensively assess the accuracy, speed, floating-point operations (FLOPs), and parameters of real-time segmentation methods. Extensive experiments on two public datasets and self-collected images have evaluated the effectiveness of our method.

Velocity Consistency Checking Based GNSS Spoofing Detection Method for Vehicles,"Autonomous driving, unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), and various other vehicular navigation schemes heavily depend on the accurate position, velocity, and timing (PVT) information offered by global navigation satellite systems (GNSSs). Meanwhile, GNSS security is challenged by spoofing attacks that aim to deceive users by inducing false PVT solutions. Therefore, detecting these attacks on time is vital for vehicular navigation security. Spoofing attacks involve transmitting counterfeit signals from spoofers instead of authentic satellites, making it difficult to coordinate spatial information accurately. To this end, the Doppler shift, revealing spatial features between transmitters and receivers, is regarded as an effective metric for spoofing detection. Especially for vehicles, due to their motion relative to the spoofer, Doppler bias is appended to the raw measurement, providing an observable spoofing signature. Conventional approaches tend to directly monitor the Doppler bias but require complex requirements like static initialization, random motion, and multiple receivers. Moreover, the commonly utilized single-antenna assumption renders them ineffective against multi-antenna spoofing attacks. This paper proposes a new approach that indirectly exploits the Doppler bias by examining its adverse impact on velocity consistency. The introduced direct velocity determination (DVD) method calculates velocity directly from the Doppler measurements, which is then utilized for consistency-checking alongside the velocity obtained from the conventional pseudorange-aided approach. We thoroughly investigate the impact of Doppler bias on velocities and analyze their consistency across different scenarios. Field tests validate the effectiveness of the proposed method, surpassing previous Doppler-based methods and the widely used receiver autonomous integrity monitoring (RAIM) method.  © 1967-2012 IEEE.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85174822703&doi=10.1109%2fTVT.2023.3321522&partnerID=40&md5=403d3f49b62a139a0030d2179f9a9ee6,IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology,2024
Anchor-Free Multi-UAV Detection and Classification Using Spectrogram,"The advancements in unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) technology have brought immense convenience to society. However, unauthorized UAVs pose a serious threat to personal privacy, public safety, and aviation security. Therefore, accurate UAV detection and classification are crucial. Moreover, with the increased popularity of UAVs, the likelihood of multiple UAVs appearing in the same area simultaneously has also dramatically increased. Recent studies demonstrate that object detectors, such as FasterRCNN and YOLO, can be used to detect and classify multiple UAVs based on spectrograms. To our best knowledge, the object detectors are directly used to classify UAV without considering the characteristics of the UAV signal spectrogram, which results in a decrease in recognition performance. In this article, we analyze the characteristics of the UAV signal spectrogram in detail and conclude two problems, i.e., prior anchor mismatch and cross-domain detection, hindering the implementation of object detector for UAV recognition. To solve prior anchor mismatch, we propose an anchor-free detector based on keypoint and design a novel keypoints matching algorithm to improve recognition performance. To solve cross-domain detection, we propose an adversarial learning-based data adaptation method, which can generate domain-independent and domain-aligned features. Finally, the experiments adopt practical spectrogram and synthetic spectrogram to verify the superiority of the proposed anchor-free detector and the effectiveness of the proposed data adaptation method.  © 2014 IEEE.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85168718680&doi=10.1109%2fJIOT.2023.3306001&partnerID=40&md5=75e5e0ad53ef7f09d99a3d708762b8e5,IEEE Internet of Things Journal,2024
Enabling secure image transmission in unmanned aerial vehicle using digital image watermarking with H-Grey optimization,"Drone technology, also known as Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs), has advanced rapidly in the last decade owing to the huge number of users. This approach has an immense opportunity in areas like healthcare, agriculture, and forestry. However, the transmission of digital images via drone technology is associated with vulnerabilities and risks, due to a lack of efficient security solutions. Digital Image Watermarking (DIW) has emerged as a viable solution for digital image transmission in UAV applications. However, achieving robustness, security, and imperceptibility in a watermarking system at the same time is a difficult task. To address the aforementioned concerns, this paper proposes a secure digital image watermarking scheme in the hybrid DWT-SVD domain. The scaling factor is chosen adaptively from the hybrid Harmony-Grey Wolf (H-Grey) optimization algorithm to maintain a balance between imperceptibility and robustness. In addition, a novel symmetric cryptographic-based four-level encryption approach PSMD (Partitioning, Substituting, Merging, Division) is proposed to address UAV image security concerns by using Fibonacci and prime number series to generate two random keys. The proposed encryption scheme provides high security at low computational cost. The experimental results show that the visual quality and robustness are both high (Avg. PSNR = 41.27 dB and Avg. SSIM = 0.99, NC = 0.99, and BER = 0.0008 calculated for 100 images). The subjective and objective experimental analysis indicates that the proposed encryption scheme is highly secure and the computational cost is also low. The average embedding and extraction time is 0.25 s and 0.09 s It is resistant to various image processing attacks. A comparison with some of the most recent popular schemes confirms the scheme's effectiveness. The presented DIW can be used for copyright protection, UAV image transmission applications, military applications, and other purposes. © 2023 Elsevier Ltd",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85169563646&doi=10.1016%2fj.eswa.2023.121190&partnerID=40&md5=1ecf4cef502e24481cc4539d5e4cd95f,Expert Systems with Applications,2024
Low-Rank Sparse Generative Adversarial Unsupervised Domain Adaptation for Multitarget Traffic Scene Semantic Segmentation,"Semantic segmentation in diverse real-world traffic scenes is a challenging task for autonomous vehicles to have a reliable understanding of the outside environment. Although deep visual models show a remarkable performance on traffic scene segmentation, they need significant improvements when the source and target scene distributions are different. The weather and illumination differences between source and target datasets result in dramatic distribution shifts that degrade the target segmentation performance. This article develops an unsupervised domain adaptation (UDA) model to address complex domain shift problems where the dataset, weather, and illumination of source and target traffic scenes are different. We devise a sparse adversarial multitarget UDA approach to capture powerful domain-invariant features to segment traffic scenes in different conditions. First, a sparse representation of the source traffic scenes is captured via a new spectral low-rank dictionary learning technique in the latent space of a deep encoder-decoder segmentation architecture. The feature sparsity provides high generalization capacity for our deep feature extractor that enables us to compute complex visual patterns of source images. Then, the distribution of source sparse features is learned using a generative adversarial framework. Finally, the sparse representations of source and target scenes are aligned via a sparse domain-invariant feature extractor trained by min-max optimization. The aligned features serve as domain-invariant scene representations that can best describe both source and target scenes; hence providing deep domain adaptation for traffic scene semantic segmentation. Experiments on a real-world dataset indicate the superiority of the proposed model compared to the state-of-the-art methodologies.  © 2005-2012 IEEE.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85165925189&doi=10.1109%2fTII.2023.3291402&partnerID=40&md5=32528910732b1bf0876c7f5f9bfba3f2,IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics,2024
Enhanced Active Eavesdroppers Detection System for Multihop WSNs in Tactical IoT Applications,"In tactical Internet of Things (IoT) applications, the broadcast nature of wireless sensor networks (WSNs) makes it easy to eavesdrop on their traffic. Furthermore, adversaries can access the sensor nodes to intercept and eavesdrop on critical wireless transmission. Research in this area focuses on reducing the eavesdropping probability through specific methods, such as encryption and transmission power control. However, eavesdropper detection techniques in WSNs do not exist in the literature. This article proposes a novel enhanced active eavesdroppers detection (EAED) system for homogeneous multihop WSNs. The EAED system consists of a monitoring module and a detection engine module. The Monitoring module plays a vital role in the EAED system to provide accurate measurements for the detection engine module. We propose three monitoring architectures for this measurement: 1) static monitoring nodes; 2) unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs)-based monitoring; and 3) neighborhood monitoring. To find the optimal locations for static monitoring nodes, we use a genetic algorithm (GA). We also use the Hamiltonian path planning to calculate the flight path for UAVs. The detection engine module utilizes a lightweight anomaly detection method that employs the $Z$ -test method and runs on edge devices. We analyze and discuss the network overhead, advantages, and disadvantages of different monitoring architectures. According to the simulation results, the EAED system can detect active eavesdroppers with a high acrlong DR $({\ge }90\%)$ and a low false-positive rate $({\leq }5\%$ ) and outstanding performance ( ${\mathrm{ AUC}}\approx 0.97$ ).  © 2014 IEEE.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85171597141&doi=10.1109%2fJIOT.2023.3313048&partnerID=40&md5=247c8886e445f6ec38ef521e5792dd9b,IEEE Internet of Things Journal,2024
Event-triggered control strategy based on absolute velocity and relative position measurements for second-order nonlinear multi-agent systems under DoS attacks,"Consensus control in multi-agent systems (MASs) has wide-ranging applications in various domains. As the scope of applications continues to expand, ensuring the secure control of these systems to counter a diverse range of network attacks becomes highly necessary. Among these threats, Denial of Service (DoS) attacks have emerged as a major network security threat, capable of rendering targeted agents or networks unable to provide normal services. This paper presents an effective control protocol aiming to achieve leader-following consensus in a second-order MAS with event-triggered control mechanism and nonlinear dynamics under DoS attacks. The protocol utilizes absolute velocity and relative position measurements. The maximum attack frequency and duration of the DoS attacks have been obtained. Furthermore, the possibility of Zeno behavior is eliminated. Theoretical analysis demonstrates that, even under DoS attacks, consensus can be maintained among the leaders and followers within the MASs.

Cooperative pursuit with multiple pursuers based on Deep Minimax Q-learning,"Cooperative pursuit with multiple pursuers is critical in swarm missions. For example, in order to capture a faster-moving evader, it becomes necessary to deploy multiple unmanned aerial vehicles to form an encirclement and approach the evader. In this paper, a cooperative pursuit strategy is developed by utilizing reinforcement learning techniques and pursuit-evasion games. Firstly, we propose a novel surrounding algorithm to form a complete encirclement based on the dynamics of pursuit-evasion games. Based on this surrounding algorithm, we employ reinforcement learning techniques to train cooperative pursuit strategies to capture the evader by surrounding and approaching the evader. In pursuit-evasion games and other non-cooperative games, it is assumed that the opponent can model the others' behaviors, adapt its adversarial strategies, and exploit the others' weaknesses. The cooperative pursuit strategy needs to consider the adversarial strategies taken by the evader and counteract them. To address this issue, we employ a Deep Minimax Q-learning algorithm to simultaneously learn the evader's adversarial strategy and the cooperative pursuit strategy that cannot be exploited by the evader.

Flying IRS: QoE-Driven Trajectory Optimization and Resource Allocation Based on Adaptive Deployment for WPCNs in 6G IoT,"6G Internet of Things (IoT) is envisioned to provide large-scale network connections and high data transmission rates to satisfy the diverse needs of IoT nodes. The wireless powered communication network (WPCN) is the essential part of the future 6G IoT, which can provide nodes with reliable and efficient data and energy transmission. In complex environments, wireless power transmissions are inefficient due to transmission distance and obstacles. To address these concerns, we propose a novel quality of experience (QoE)-driven framework for aerial intelligent reflective surface (IRS)-assisted WPCN, which exploits the maneuverability of unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) to improve the network performance. In the framework, we construct a nonlinear satisfaction function to quantify the QoE and design an adaptive reflective units configuration scheme based on the QoE to reduce resource consumption (e.g., energy) while satisfying the QoE requirements. The optimization problem of maximizing average throughput is formulated by jointly optimizing the aerial IRS flight trajectory, node association variable, time slot allocation ratio, and IRS phase. The existence of coupling between optimization variables and the nonconvexity lead to the difficulty of solving the optimization problem directly. To effectively solve the above optimization problem, the block coordinate descent (BCD) algorithm is utilized to decompose the optimization problem into four subproblems to be solved separately. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed scheme can significantly enhance the throughput compared with other schemes.  © 2014 IEEE.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85174830554&doi=10.1109%2fJIOT.2023.3322266&partnerID=40&md5=d044a112d32cdbb6c5ef6d693d7af782,IEEE Internet of Things Journal,2024
Flexible and Secure Cross-Domain Signcrypted Data Authorization in Multi-Platoon Vehicular Networks,"Autonomous Vehicle Platooning (AVP) presents a promising approach to reducing energy expenses, improving traffic safety, and enhancing capacity. In multi-platoon vehicular networks, platoons can collaborate to ensure better data transfer reliability. However, the existing secure information-sharing methods between platoons face efficiency and security challenges. These challenges arise from (1) a lack of an efficient method to simultaneously ensure confidentiality, authenticity, and non-repudiation of the transmitted information; (2) difficulty in cross-domain dynamically sharing ciphertexts to multiple recipients is challenging. To overcome these challenges, we propose a Flexible Cross-domain Data Access Control (FC-DAC) system in this paper. Our FC-DAC system ensures confidentiality, authenticity, and non-repudiation of transmitted information while enabling high-efficiency ciphertext sharing between various platoons. Additionally, the FC-DAC solution allows vehicles with valid authorizations to access signcrypted information quickly and efficiently, even if they belong to different platoons.

Driving Visual Saliency Prediction of Dynamic Night Scenes via a Spatio-Temporal Dual-Encoder Network,"Driving at night is more challenging and dangerous than driving during the day. Modeling driver eye movement and attention allocation during night driving can help guide unmanned intelligent vehicles and improve safety during similar situations. However, until now, few studies have modeled a drivers' true fixations and attention allocation in specific night circumstance. Therefore, we collected an eye tracking dataset from 30 experienced drivers while they viewed night driving videos under a hypothetical driving condition, termed Driver Fixation Dataset in night (DrFixD(night)). Based on DrFixD(night) which includes multiple drivers' attention allocation, we proposed a spatio-temporal dual-encoder network model, named as STDE-Net, to improve saliency detection in night driving condition. The model includes three modules: i) spatio-temporal dual encoding module, ii) fusion module based on attention mechanism, and iii) decoding module. A convolutional LSTM is employed to learn the time connection of video sequences, and a convolution neural network combined pyramid dilated convolution is adopted to extract spatial features in the spatio-temporal dual encoding module. The attention mechanism is exploited to fuse the temporal and spatial features together and selectively highlight the significant features in night traffic scene. We compared the proposed model with other traditional methods and deep learning models, both qualitatively and quantitatively, and found that the proposed model can predict driver's fixation more accurately. Specifically, the proposed model not only predicts the main goals, but also predicts the important sub goals, such as pedestrians, bicycles and so on, showing excellent prediction of dimly lit targets at night. © 2000-2011 IEEE.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85174822378&doi=10.1109%2fTITS.2023.3323468&partnerID=40&md5=f313a6530d99d259e1d8436815d7cced,IEEE Transactions on Intelligent Transportation Systems,2024
Autonomous control of UAV trajectory based on RHC-Radau method in complex penetration combat environment,"Unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) systems are required to independently make timely and accurate attack and control strategies according to dynamic battlefield situations. To optimize the trajectory control of UAVs for ground penetration combat, a 3-degree-of-freedom model and a dynamic model of UAV were established. Considering the constraints of initial and terminal conditions and flight performance, the penetration combat model under multiple constraints is established. A dynamic radar cross section (RCS) threat model is demonstrated based on characteristics of RCS. Combined with the hp-adaptive-Radau pseudo-spectral method and the receding horizon control algorithm under the optimal control model, the flight time and the threat probability of the UAV to the combat area were taken as the objective functions.

Source Location Privacy Protection Algorithm Based on Polyhedral Phantom Routing in Underwater Acoustic Sensor Networks,"Based on the review of existing source location privacy protection technologies and research on underwater data transmission, numerous scholars have performed extensive work in the field of source location privacy protection. Further, current methods for protecting the source node location privacy in Internet of Underwater Things (IoUT), especially in underwater acoustic sensor networks (UASNs), suffer from several issues, including high data transmission energy consumption, short network lifespan, and inability to ensure data accuracy. Moreover, current common security research on UASNs considers only passive attacks and has fewer countermeasures for active attacks. To address these challenges, this article proposes a source location privacy protection algorithm based on polyhedral phantom routing in UASNs (PPR-USLP). First, the polyhedral phantom routing algorithm based on platonic solids is employed to introduce phantom nodes, which increases path diversity and protects the privacy of the source node, thereby thwarting passive attacks from adversaries and prolonging the life cycle of the network. Second, suitable relay nodes are selected by considering the peripheral status of the nodes, the data are collected by autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs) to reduce the waiting time of sensor nodes and reduce the energy consumption of data transmission. Furthermore, to ensure data integrity and defend against active attacks from adversaries, this article combines error correction coding, which enhances network resilience and security while improving throughput and achieving load balancing. The simulation results demonstrate that PPR-USLP exhibits favorable performance in terms of energy consumption, safety time, and data accuracy, effectively safeguarding the privacy of the underwater source locations.  © 2014 IEEE.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85173001407&doi=10.1109%2fJIOT.2023.3318567&partnerID=40&md5=d0841cf354df2e99ad5b5bc585383ca6,IEEE Internet of Things Journal,2024
AERO: Automotive Ethernet Real-Time Observer for Anomaly Detection in In-Vehicle Networks,"Automotive Ethernet enables high-bandwidth in-vehicle networking, facilitating the transmission of sensor data among electronic control units. However, the increasing connectivity and potential vulnerability inheritance in connected and autonomous vehicles expose them to security risks. To address this challenge, an intrusion detection system (IDS) capable of analyzing automotive Ethernet traffic and detecting anomalies is essential. In thisarticle, we propose automotive Ethernet real-time observer (AERO), an unsupervised network IDS designed to protect in-vehicle networks. AERO consists of three components: a feature extractor that constructs three multimodal features, a neural network for processing the extracted features, and an online anomaly detector that calculates outlier scores in real time. We evaluate the performance of AERO using the TOW-IDS automotive Ethernet intrusion dataset. The experimental results demonstrate that AERO achieves high detection performance across five different attack types and is highly applicable to automotive-grade devices for real-time anomaly detection.  © 2005-2012 IEEE.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85177034255&doi=10.1109%2fTII.2023.3324949&partnerID=40&md5=1bb1c19ff7f9439b20662d2e08956212,IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics,2024
Unleashing the two-dimensional benefits of connected and automated vehicles via dedicated intersections in mixed traffic,"The management of mixed traffic systems is critical to realize the benefits of connected and automated vehicles (CAVs). Generally, the benefits of CAVs can be categorized into the one-dimensional benefits of improving car-following performance and the two-dimensional benefits of efficiently addressing right-of-way conflicts. Researchers have proposed dedicated lanes that can exploit the one-dimensional benefits of CAVs, but the two-dimensional benefits remain unexplored in mixed traffic environments. To fully release the benefits of CAVs, we introduce an innovative approach for managing mixed traffic in road networks, known as the dedicated intersection strategy. Specifically, the dedicated intersection strategy refers to constructing two-dimensional CAV-dedicated right-of-way within the road network, achieving separation between CAVs and human driven vehicles (HDVs) at the intersection level. However, the deployment problem of dedicated intersections is an NP-hard problem. Therefore, we propose a bi-level solving framework, in which the upper level determines the dedicated intersection deployment scheme and the lower level solves the corresponding traffic assignment problem. To quickly find adequate deployment schemes, we propose an artificial bee colony based intelligent algorithm. Our numerical experiments demonstrate that the proposed algorithm can quickly find near-optimal dedicated intersection deployment schemes within a small number of iterations. Compared to regular intersections, the deployment of dedicated intersections in the road network can improve overall traffic system efficiency, particularly for CAVs. Finally, microscopic traffic simulation experiments further verify the superior performance of the proposed dedicated intersection strategy. © 2024 Elsevier Ltd",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85185404448&doi=10.1016%2fj.trc.2024.104501&partnerID=40&md5=eb96321fbb05af001b3dfb4c6f979d6c,Transportation Research Part C: Emerging Technologies,2024
Multiobjective Optimization of Space-Air-Ground-Integrated Network Slicing Relying on a Pair of Central and Distributed Learning Algorithms,"As an attractive enabling technology for next-generation wireless communications, network slicing supports diverse customized services in the global space-air-ground-integrated network (SAGIN) with diverse resource constraints. In this article, we dynamically consider three typical classes of radio access network (RAN) slices, namely, high-throughput slices, low-delay slices and wide-coverage slices, under the same underlying physical SAGIN. The throughput, the service delay, and the coverage area of these three classes of RAN slices are jointly optimized in a nonscalar form by considering the distinct channel features and service advantages of the terrestrial, aerial, and satellite components of acrshortpl SAGIN. A joint central and distributed multiagent deep deterministic policy gradient (CDMADDPG) algorithm is proposed for solving the above problem to obtain the Pareto-optimal solutions. The algorithm first determines the optimal virtual unmanned aerial vehicle (vUAV) positions and the interslice subchannel and power sharing by relying on a centralized unit. Then, it optimizes the intraslice subchannel and power allocation, and the virtual base station (vBS)/vUAV/virtual low Earth orbit (vLEO) satellite deployment in support of three classes of slices by three separate distributed units. Simulation results verify that the proposed method approaches the Pareto-optimal exploitation of multiple RAN slices, and outperforms the benchmarkers.  © 2014 IEEE.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85172989225&doi=10.1109%2fJIOT.2023.3319130&partnerID=40&md5=b87cf9881a672a548a926af556b1ba0c,IEEE Internet of Things Journal,2024
A deep reinforcement learning-based active suspension control algorithm considering deterministic experience tracing for autonomous vehicle,"As the challenges in autonomous driving become more complex and changing, traditional methods are struggling to cope. As a result, artificial intelligence (AI) techniques have gained widespread attention due to their potential in addressing these challenges. To investigate the application and performance of deep reinforcement learning (DRL) techniques in vertical control of autonomous vehicles, we propose an active suspension control algorithm that incorporates deterministic experience tracing (DET). The agent explores and learns deterministic policies by interacting with the environment and continuously exploring and exploiting the generated data. During this process, DET stores state and action data in a separate experience memory buffer over time. Additionally, DET processes this information into auxiliary rewards that decay based on temporal logic. This drives the agent to self-iterate and rapidly improve. DET allows AI techniques to incorporate temporal robustness into data-driven learning, resulting in improved generalization performance and optimized ride comfort in engineering applications. Simulation results demonstrated that DET improved control performance by 74.92%, 64.20%, and 54.64% compared to the deep deterministic policy gradient (DDPG), twin delayed deep deterministic policy gradient (TD3), and model predictive control (MPC) baselines, respectively. Furthermore, it achieved nearly a 90% improvement in ride comfort on random roads in classes A, B, and C across different speeds. Even on class D roads, the optimization remained around 85%, demonstrating its excellent generalization performance. © 2024 Elsevier B.V.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85184842755&doi=10.1016%2fj.asoc.2024.111259&partnerID=40&md5=e9028d5c519d3034451449370e29022b,Applied Soft Computing,2024
"Toward a Sustainable Internet of Underwater Things Based on AUVs, SWIPT, and Reinforcement Learning","Life on Earth depends on healthy oceans, which supply a large percentage of the planet's oxygen, food, and energy. However, the oceans are under threat from climate change, which is devastating the marine ecosystem and the economic and social systems that depend on it. The Internet of Underwater Things (IoUT), a global interconnection of underwater objects, enables round-the-clock monitoring of the oceans. It provides high-resolution data for training machine learning (ML) algorithms for rapidly evaluating potential climate change solutions and speeding up decision making. The sensors in conventional IoUT are battery powered, which limits their lifetime, and constitutes environmental hazards when they die. In this article, we propose a sustainable scheme to improve the throughput and enable wireless charging of underwater networks, enabling them to potentially operate indefinitely. The scheme is based on simultaneous wireless information and power transfer (SWIPT) from an autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV) used for data collection. We model the problem of jointly maximizing throughput and harvested power as a Markov decision process (MDP), and develop a model-free reinforcement learning (RL) solution. The model's reward function incentivises the AUV to find optimal trajectories that maximize throughput and power transfer to the underwater nodes while minimising its own energy consumption. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first attempt at using RL for this application. The scheme is implemented in an open 3-D RL environment specifically developed in MATLAB for this study. The performance results show up 207% improvement in energy efficiency compared to those of a random trajectory scheme used as a baseline model.  © 2014 IEEE.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85167401895&doi=10.1109%2fJIOT.2023.3319250&partnerID=40&md5=0aa6016b2787b8c32a91626c5cbe5683,IEEE Internet of Things Journal,2024
RPAU: Fooling the Eyes of UAVs via Physical Adversarial Patches,"Recently, Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) deployed with deep learning models have been widely applied both in civil and military. However, the vulnerability of the deployed model to adversarial attacks has raised security concerns. Previous studies have mainly explored adversarial attacks in the digital domain. While physical attacks have posed a more serious threat to UAVs. In this paper, we have explored a novel Robust Physical Attack against UAVs named RPAU, which directly threatens the flight safety of UAVs. Specifically, three attacks are proposed in RPAU: Hiding Attack (HA), Yaw Attack (YA), and Obstacle Attack (OA). To launch the attacks, we overcome three domain-design challenges, including continuous perturbation, digital-physical domain gap, and optimum perturbation generation. For continuous perturbation, we have introduced a nested patch that realizes attacks at any distance. Further, a series of transformations are considered to narrow the gap between the digital and physical domains. Then, we proposed a time-dependent mechanism for generating optimum perturbation. We conducted comprehensive experiments in the digital domain, simulation environment, and physical domain. The experimental results validate the robustness of the proposed framework. In the digital domain, RPAU outperforms the baseline by 54.9% average attack success rate (ASR). More importantly, RPAU is still effective in both the simulation environment and the physical domain, achieving an average ASR of 100%. © 2000-2011 IEEE.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85173332815&doi=10.1109%2fTITS.2023.3317054&partnerID=40&md5=b8d8d1e5a016455c7fb723ac6d185b11,IEEE Transactions on Intelligent Transportation Systems,2024

Optimizing Fault-Tolerant Quality-Guaranteed Sensor Deployments for UAV Localization in Critical Areas via Computational Geometry,"The increasing spreading of small commercial unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs, also known as drones) presents serious threats for critical areas, such as airports, power plants, and governmental and military facilities. In fact, such UAVs can easily disturb or jam radio communications, collide with other flying objects, perform espionage activity, and carry offensive payloads, e.g., weapons or explosives. A central problem when designing surveillance solutions for the localization of unauthorized UAVs in critical areas is to decide how many triangulating sensors to use, and where to deploy them to optimize both coverage and cost effectiveness. In this article, we compute deployments of triangulating sensors for UAV localization, optimizing a given blend of metrics, namely: coverage under multiple sensing quality levels, cost-effectiveness, and fault-tolerance. We focus on large, complex three-dimensional (3-D) regions, which exhibit obstacles (e.g., buildings), varying terrain elevation, different coverage priorities, and constraints on possible sensors placement. Our novel approach relies on computational geometry and statistical model checking and enables the effective use of off-the-shelf AI-based black-box optimizers. Moreover, our method allows us to compute a closed-form, analytical representation of the region uncovered by a sensor deployment, which provides the means for rigorous, formal certification of the quality of the latter. We show the practical feasibility of our approach by computing optimal sensor deployments for UAV localization in two large, complex 3-D critical regions, the Rome Leonardo Da Vinci International Airport (FCO) and the Vienna International Center (VIC), using NOMAD as our state-of-the-art underlying optimization engine. Results show that we can compute optimal sensor deployments within a few hours on a standard workstation and within minutes on a small parallel infrastructure. © 2013 IEEE.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85178026609&doi=10.1109%2fTSMC.2023.3327432&partnerID=40&md5=bddb2bcb04d397c3777c1df4d62630a1,"IEEE Transactions on Systems, Man, and Cybernetics: Systems",2024
CVTNet: A Cross-View Transformer Network for LiDAR-Based Place Recognition in Autonomous Driving Environments,"LiDAR-based place recognition (LPR) is one of the most crucial components of autonomous vehicles to identify previously visited places in GPS-denied environments. Most existing LPR methods use mundane representations of the input point cloud without considering different views, which may not fully exploit the information from LiDAR sensors. In this article, we propose a cross-view transformer-based network, dubbed CVTNet, to fuse the range image views and bird's eye views generated from the LiDAR data. It extracts correlations within the views using intratransformers and between the two different views using intertransformers. Based on that, our proposed CVTNet generates a yaw-angle-invariant global descriptor for each laser scan end-to-end online and retrieves previously seen places by descriptor matching between the current query scan and the prebuilt database. We evaluate our approach on three datasets collected with different sensor setups and environmental conditions. The experimental results show that our method outperforms the state-of-the-art LPR methods with strong robustness to viewpoint changes and long-time spans. Furthermore, our approach has better real-time performance that can run faster than the typical LiDAR frame rate does.  © 2005-2012 IEEE.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85172439470&doi=10.1109%2fTII.2023.3313635&partnerID=40&md5=b4502c2d783c594884cef38a648dcf0b,IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics,2024
Virtual-Mobile-Agent-Assisted Boundary Tracking for Continuous Objects in Underwater Acoustic Sensor Networks,"Aquatic environments confront mounting threats from diverse sources, among which the persistent migration of continuous objects (e.g., chemical contaminants) is a primary concern. While advances have been made in tracking these entities using underwater acoustic sensor networks (UASNs), full-scale monitoring is challenged by unpredictable sensor deployments. Though Autonomous underwater vehicles show promise, their prohibitive costs and operational complexities limit their broad adoption. To tackle these issues, this article introduces a novel search strategy named virtual mobile agent-assisted continuous object tracking (VMA-COT). Drawing inspiration from binary tree structures, VMA-COT refines the search from the entire network to targeted hierarchical boundary mapping cells. Each cell encompasses a Section of the object's boundary. A designated node within each cell evaluates information entropy at specified locations using a meticulously designed search sequence. By utilizing a feedback mechanism, grounded in the information entropy and the search sequence, VMA-COT progressively pinpoints the boundary. This methodology can be likened to a central node dispatching mobile agents in each cell. These agents, limited by a specific step range, adjust their trajectories for precise boundary delineation. Empirical tests and simulations demonstrate the effectiveness of VMA-COT, highlighting its efficiency, accuracy, and boundary node utilization.  © 2014 IEEE.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85174821773&doi=10.1109%2fJIOT.2023.3322280&partnerID=40&md5=988f2b0e4f914003b168cec4b653e1ec,IEEE Internet of Things Journal,2024
Quantum-Assisted activation for supervised learning in healthcare-based intrusion detection systems,"Intrusion detection systems (IDSs) are amongst the most important automated defense mechanisms in modern industry. It is guarding against many attack vectors, especially in healthcare, where sensitive information (patients medical history, prescriptions, electronic health records, medical bills/debts, and many other sensitive data points) is open to compromise from adversaries. In the big data era, classical machine learning has been applied to train IDS. However, classical IDS tend to be complex: either using several hidden layers susceptible to overfitting on training data or using overly complex architectures such as convolutional neural networks, long-short term memory systems, and recurrent neural networks. This article explored the combination of principles of quantum mechanics and neural networks to train IDS. A hybrid classical-quantum neural architecture is proposed with a quantum-Assisted activation function that successfully captures patterns in the dataset while having less architectural memory footprint than classical solutions. The experimental results are demonstrated on the popular KDD99 dataset while comparing our solution to other classical models. Impact Statement Intrusion detection systems are dynamic defenses against network breach attacks. Lately, machine learning has been leveraged to perform automated intrusion detection. However, classical machine learning needs a large amount of data and overly complex architectures to ""learn"" patterns from data. In this work, we leverage machine learning concepts to derive a novel quantum activation function that greatly simplifies neural architectural complexity while achieving same level of accuracy and performance. Our architecture is much simpler than state-ofthe-Art based classical systems, simpler to train, and easy to handle. © 2024 Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc..

Radar/visual fusion with fuse-before-track strategy for low altitude non-cooperative sense and avoid,"Non-cooperative Sense and Avoid is a critical technology for the safety and autonomy of Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAV). Standalone sensing solutions, i.e., only based on either visual cameras or radars, encounter challenges especially for vehicles flying at low altitude. To overcome this limit, sensor fusion strategies can play a key role. In this framework, this paper proposes a two-step radar/visual sensor fusion approach taking place both at detection and tracking level. The first step, named “Fuse-Before-Track”, consists in jointly using radar information and visual detections (provided by Convolutional Neural Network-based detectors) to remove uninteresting radar echoes thus improving ground clutter removal and speeding up the radar processing pipeline. At the second level, tracking takes place by exploiting the previously retrieved (confirmed) radar measurements and fusing visual detections to improve the solution accuracy. The proposed approach is tested on data collected during experimental flight tests where a ground-fixed multi-sensor setup (integrating a low size weight and power radar and a daylight camera) is used to detect and track a small UAV manually piloted to carry out approaching manoeuvres. Detection and tracking performance is assessed using, as a benchmark, a cm-level relative positioning solution retrieved by means of Carrier Phase Differential GNSS techniques. The implemented detection-level fusion approach ensures radar detection accuracy of meter level and meter-per-second level on range and range rate, respectively. In addition, the second level of fusion allows attaining sub-degree level errors in the angular and angular rates estimates at a tracking stage. Tracking data are finally used for conflict threat assessment, i.e., to get estimates of the distance and time at closest point of approach, with mean errors on the former of about 10 m in most encounters when the latter falls below 50 s. © 2024",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85185279890&doi=10.1016%2fj.ast.2024.108946&partnerID=40&md5=ffdecf787996c23c3762cfbd262ab3b6,Aerospace Science and Technology,2024
Effectiveness of ocean gliders in monitoring ocean acoustics and anthropogenic noise from ships: A systematic review,"Underwater noise emissions from marine vehicles contribute to increasing ocean ambient noise levels, which is a threat to marine ecosystems. Passive acoustic monitoring, normally performed using moored-anchored systems, is commonly used to assess ocean soundscapes, vessel noise, and the presence of marine species. A systematic literature review was conducted to explore the use of autonomous underwater gliders (AUG) as an alternative to traditional moored systems for monitoring and assessing ship noise levels. We conducted thorough searches in Scopus and Web of Science, following the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses guidelines. We considered 13 articles on ocean glider applications for passive surveys and 8 articles on challenges in assessing underwater ship noise levels. Our findings were supplemented with international standards and guidelines from classification societies. Gliders are effective platforms for ship noise signature assessment due to their low noise signature and extended autonomy. In addition, AUGs can perform a 3D scan of the water column salinity, temperature, and density, which are needed to estimate sound propagation loss accurately. Further research is required to assess the potential of AUGs for accurately estimating ship noise levels by integrating oceanographic and acoustic data. © 2024 The Authors",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85184508743&doi=10.1016%2fj.oceaneng.2024.116993&partnerID=40&md5=0273bd2d4b6e298c31e6d2749000f362,Ocean Engineering,2024
Smart Mobility Digital Twin Based Automated Vehicle Navigation System: A Proof of Concept,"Digital twins (DTs) have driven major advancements across various industrial domains over the past two decades. With the rapid advancements in autonomous driving and vehicle-to-everything (V2X) technologies, integrating DTs into vehicular platforms is anticipated to further revolutionize smart mobility systems. In this paper, a new smart mobility DT (SMDT) platform is proposed for the control of connected and automated vehicles (CAVs) over next-generation wireless networks. In particular, the proposed platform enables cloud services to leverage the abilities of DTs to promote the autonomous driving experience. To enhance traffic efficiency and road safety measures, a novel navigation system that exploits available DT information is designed. The SMDT platform and navigation system are implemented with state-of-the-art products, e.g., CAVs and roadside units (RSUs), and emerging technologies, e.g., cloud and cellular V2X (C-V2X). In addition, proof-of-concept (PoC) experiments are conducted to validate system performance. The performance of SMDT is evaluated from two standpoints: (i) the rewards of the proposed navigation system on traffic efficiency and safety and, (ii) the latency and reliability of the SMDT platform. Our experimental results using SUMO-based large-scale traffic simulations show that the proposed SMDT can reduce the average travel time and the blocking probability due to unexpected traffic incidents. Furthermore, the results record a peak overall latency for DT modeling and route planning services to be 155.15 ms and 810.59 ms, respectively, which validates that our proposed design aligns with the 3GPP requirements for emerging V2X use cases and fulfills the targets of the proposed design.  © 2016 IEEE.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85186075938&doi=10.1109%2fTIV.2024.3368109&partnerID=40&md5=51252c88b5663d47e9d3083eea382b5a,IEEE Transactions on Intelligent Vehicles,2024
Light-Driven Micro/Nanorobot for Biomimetic Optical Communication,"Light sensing and communication represent a vital link in the progress of biological evolution, helping organisms to respond to their environment and carry out survival activities. To simulate this process and exploit it in engineering applications, we develop a light-driven micro/nanorobotic system. Like the natural defense mechanisms of biological vision, these robots can mimic the sensitivity and responsiveness of living organisms to light stimuli. Additionally, the development of nanotechnology and molecular communication (MC) caters to the trend of the Internet of Bio-Nano Things. However, there are still difficulties in conducting systematic research at the experimental level in related scientific fields. To bridge the gap between the simulation of MC with micro/nanorobots and the construction of an experimental testbed, a complete micro/nano-scale communication platform is built by using customized optical microscopy equipment. We use Cu2O micro/nanorobots to imitate the natural properties of molecules, since under negative phototactic motion they are suitable for being a message carrier in MC. This is similar to the behavior of visual organisms that receive external light stimuli and convert them into biomolecular signals. Information is transmitted by controlling the self-driving of the micro/nanorobots with in-situ signals. We propose three low-complexity threshold-based detectors to recover information from the received signal. Experimental results show that the light-driven micro/nanorobots can meet the requirements of multi-directional manipulation. Through the implemented miniaturized observation testbed coupled with light-driven micro/nanorobots, microparticle-based information transmission is accomplished by utilizing the properties of micro/nanorobots.  © 2016 IEEE.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85182939332&doi=10.1109%2fLRA.2024.3355643&partnerID=40&md5=69b0159c52ba5be332facd92c8e5e8e5,IEEE Robotics and Automation Letters,2024
Learning two-dimensional merging behaviour from vehicle trajectories with imitation learning,"Merging behaviour is a fundamental yet challenging driving task which has significant impact on traffic flow operations. While numerous efforts have been made on the modelling of decision-making of lane-based merging behaviour, little was focusing on the simulation of the complete merging process, which generates two-dimensional merging trajectories allowing for the investigation of merging behaviour's impact on the traffic flow. This study thus aims to develop a two-dimensional data-driven simulation model for merging behaviour based on the emerging imitation learning framework for generating realistic vehicle trajectories and traffic characteristics. To account for the specific goal of merging vehicles (reaching the planned destination) and the presence of suboptimal behaviours in real traffic, we incorporate goal-conditioned and confidence-aware mechanisms into adversarial inverse reinforcement learning (is referred to as GC-AIRL) to learn the merging behaviour from real-traffic demonstrations. Using the vehicle trajectories data extracted from the NGSIM dataset, we demonstrate that the proposed model is capable of generating two-dimensional vehicle trajectories with superior efficiency, safety, and comfort performance compared to human drivers. The superiority of the GC-AIRL model is validated by comparing with several bench-marking models, including the basic AIRL model, generative adversarial imitation learning (GAIL) model, a reinforcement learning (RL) based model, and long short-term memory (LSTM) model. Moreover, we examine the transferability of the proposed model in producing merging behaviour at a new site that indicates its applicability in diverse environments.

A State-Decomposition DDPG Algorithm for UAV Autonomous Navigation in 3-D Complex Environments,"Over the past decade, unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) have been widely applied in many areas, such as goods delivery, disaster monitoring, search and rescue etc. In most of these applications, autonomous navigation is one of the key techniques that enable UAV to perform various tasks. However, UAV autonomous navigation in complex environments presents significant challenges due to the difficulty in simultaneously observing, orientation, decision and action. In this work, an efficient state-decomposition deep deterministic policy gradient algorithm is proposed for UAV autonomous navigation (SDDPG-NAV) in 3-D complex environments. In SDDPG-NAV, a novel state-decomposition method that uses two subnetworks for the perception-related and target-related states separately is developed to establish more appropriate actor networks. We also designed some objective-oriented reward functions to solve the sparse reward problem, including approaching the target, and avoiding obstacles and step award functions. Moreover, some training strategies are introduced to maintain the balance between exploration and exploitation, and the network is well trained with numerous experiments. The proposed SDDPG-NAV algorithm is capable of adapting to surrounding environments with generalized training experiences and effectively improves UAV's navigation performance in 3-D complex environments.

Security and Reliability Tradeoff of UAV Relays Assisted Cognitive Transmissions with Hardware Impairments,"In this article, we analyze the security and reliability tradeoff (SRT) performance of a unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) relays assisted cognitive network consisting of a cognitive source (S), multiple cognitive UAV relays (Rs), a cognitive destination (D) in the face of an eavesdropper (E). We consider a practical scenario where mutual interference exists between the primary users and cognitive users. In order to protect the wireless transmission against the eavesdropping attack, we propose two UAV relay selection schemes, namely, noninterference aware relay selection (NIARS) scheme and interference aware relay selection (IARS) scheme. Specifically, in the NIARS scheme, a relay having the best instantaneous (R-D) link (spanning from Rs to D) is selected to forward message. By contrast, a relay maximizing the main channel capacity is selected, which relies not only on the channel state informations (CSIs) of main links but also on the CSIs of the interference links. For the purpose of comparison, we present the round robin (RR) scheme as a baseline. To evaluate the SRT performance, we derive the closed-form intercept probability (IP) and outage probability (OP) expressions for RR, NIARS, and IARS schemes under the impact of hardware impairments (HIs) over Nakagami-m fading channels. Numerical results show that the proposed IARS and NIARS schemes perform better than RR scheme in terms of SRT performance. Additionally, the HI at D has a negative impact on SRT performance, while HI at E has a positive impact on SRT performance.  © 2014 IEEE.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85176354524&doi=10.1109%2fJIOT.2023.3327577&partnerID=40&md5=2510ceb182ccae562b3b0e892f4c8837,IEEE Internet of Things Journal,2024
Light-YOLOv5: A Lightweight Drone Detector for Resource-Constrained Cameras,"Critical infrastructures (CIs), such as military bases and airports, are putting a lot of attention into defending against attacks delivered via drones by deploying drone detection systems. However, the CI area might be very large, with no-fly zones extending to regions where it might not be possible to deploy a power line for resourceful cameras. To this aim, the CI might deploy an Internet of Things (IoT)-based surveillance camera system to capture drone images. However, these IoT cameras are resource-constrained devices that cannot support the currently available detectors. In this article, we propose Light-YOLOv5, a lightweight image-based drone detector for resource-constrained cameras. We make targeted improvements to YOLOv5, including the replacement of the backbone network, the introduction of the transformer module, and the design of a parallel mixed efficient attention module (PEAM). We show that our modifications allow for reduced network size while achieving better classification than other state-of-the-art solutions. To prove these claims, we expanded an already available data set of blurred drone images by adding clear images of aircraft and birds. Since airplanes and birds are easily confused as drones by image classifiers, our addition proves the effectiveness of our solution. Experiments show that Light-YOLOv5 can achieve a very good tradeoff between performance (74.8% mAP) and efficiency (170 FPS). Compared to YOLOv5, Light-YOLOv5 improves mAP by 4.1%, reduces the number of network parameters by 15.7%, can perform detection at 170 frames per second (FPS), and achieves an average accuracy rate of 93.8%.  © 2014 IEEE.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85181824089&doi=10.1109%2fJIOT.2023.3329221&partnerID=40&md5=142711fbe6a5a800a8b4560654de0673,IEEE Internet of Things Journal,2024
Lightweight Blockchain-Enhanced Mutual Authentication Protocol for UAVs,"With the rapid increase of data from unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), the security and privacy of data presents a severe challenge for UAV-based applications. Moreover, UAVs with constrained resources cannot be equipped with strong but complicated cryptographic primitives for authentication protocol design. Although some attempts have been made to deal with security and privacy issues for UAVs, most of the existing studies have been found numerous security vulnerabilities or own extreme communication/computation overheads. This article offers a lightweight and practical mutual authentication protocol solely comprised of bitwise XOR operations and one-way hash functions. Moreover, blockchain technology is utilized to alleviate the centralized trusted party (TA) issue. Then, security of our proposed authentication protocol is proved by widely adopted formal security proof - Real-or-Random model and informal security proof. The experimental results prove that the proposed protocol can achieve better security requirements (e.g., decentralized TA, replay attack defense, and session key security) with less communication cost (i.e., reduced by around 58.7% at most) and computation cost (i.e., reduced by around 98.9% at most) than related UAV authentication schemes.  © 2014 IEEE.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85174854455&doi=10.1109%2fJIOT.2023.3324543&partnerID=40&md5=a0b40a4c899f565356f83adc58f805a1,IEEE Internet of Things Journal,2024
3-D UAV Small Cell Base Station Positioning and Resource Allocation in Cellular Network: A Stochastic Optimization Approach,"Integrating unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) into wireless communication as aerial platforms to mount small cell base stations has grown rapidly in recent years. One of the main objectives of UAV integration into wireless networks is to optimize UAV deployment while meeting user expectations with the fewest UAVs. To ensure that users receive the requested data rate, management of UAV placement and user association is necessary due to the limited capacity of aerial base stations. Besides the user-base station distance, environmental conditions and propagation mode affect the data rate received by the users. When accounting for uncertain conditions, network management decisions become more realistic and productive. This article considers a random propagation mode for each link depending on the environmental conditions of the desired area. We exploit the stochastic programming framework to reflect propagation mode uncertainty in the optimization problem, which impacts the received data rate and path loss. The suggested mathematical formulation determines the minimum number of required UAVs, their 3-D positions, and the best user association strategy. The proposed model also includes interference-aware constraints for optimal radio resource allocation to base stations. The nonlinear path loss and line-of-sight (LoS) probability distribution functions in terms of the base station positions lead to a nonlinear formulation. We obtain a mixed-binary linear formulation by replacing nonlinear functions with their piecewise linear approximations and solve the model accurately using the CPLEX solver. The implementation results show that stochastic approaches provide more accurate diagnoses of the environment, as well as superior performance to deterministic optimization.  © 2014 IEEE.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85177053257&doi=10.1109%2fJIOT.2023.3329718&partnerID=40&md5=066499b885e2b3d65390fc17d9d4a879,IEEE Internet of Things Journal,2024
IC-GAN: An Improved Conditional Generative Adversarial Network for RGB-to-IR image translation with applications to forest fire monitoring,"This paper introduces a novel Deep Learning (DL) architecture for inferring temperature information from aerial true-color RGB images by transforming them into Infrared Radiation (IR) domain. This work is motivated by a few facts. First, off-the-shelf contemporary drones are typically equipped only with regular cameras. Second, IR heat-mapping cameras are costly and heavy for payload-limited drones. Third, additional communication channels and power supply would be needed when including IR cameras. Finally, IR cameras provide lower resolution and shorter distance ranges than RGB cameras. Therefore, learning-based translation of aerial IR recordings to RGB images can be extremely useful not only for new tests but also for offline processing of the currently available forest fire datasets with RGB images. We offer an Improved Conditional-Generative Adversarial Network (IC-GAN), where matched IR images are used as a condition to guide the translation process by the generator. The U-Net-based generator is concatenated with a mapper module to transform the output into a stack of diverse color spaces with learnable parameters. To avoid the unnecessary penalization of pixel-level disparities and achieve structural similarity, we include clustering alignment to the loss function. The proposed framework is compared against several state-of-the-art methods, including U-Net, Efficient U-Net, GAN, and Conditional-GAN from both subjective (human perception) and objective evaluation perspectives. The results support our method's efficacy, demonstrating a significant improvement of around 6% in PSNR, 15% in UQI, 9% in SSIM, and 23% in IoU metrics. © 2023 Elsevier Ltd",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85174153383&doi=10.1016%2fj.eswa.2023.121962&partnerID=40&md5=216c4042f272d428d06e5d7fa8a2f4c1,Expert Systems with Applications,2024
Causality-driven Testing of Autonomous Driving Systems,"Testing Autonomous Driving Systems (ADS) is essential for safe development of self-driving cars. For thorough and realistic testing, ADS are usually embedded in a simulator and tested in interaction with the simulated environment. However, their high complexity and the multiple safety requirements lead to costly and ineffective testing. Recent techniques exploit many-objective strategies and ML to efficiently search the huge input space. Despite the indubitable advances, the need for smartening the search keep being pressing. This article presents CART (CAusal-Reasoning-driven Testing), a new technique that formulates testing as a causal reasoning task. Learning causation, unlike correlation, allows assessing the effect of actively changing an input on the output, net of possible confounding variables. CART first infers the causal relations between test inputs and outputs, then looks for promising tests by querying the learnt model. Only tests suggested by the model are run on the simulator. An extensive empirical evaluation, using Pylot as ADS and CARLA as simulator, compares CART with state-of-the-art algorithms used recently on ADS. CART shows a significant gain in exposing more safety violations and does so more efficiently. More broadly, the work opens to a wider exploitation of causal learning beside (or on top of) ML for testing-related tasks.  © 2024 Copyright held by the owner/author(s).",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85191985111&doi=10.1145%2f3635709&partnerID=40&md5=ff8ace0c9bb6e6b17e2519d7d3c4d1c4,ACM Transactions on Software Engineering and Methodology,2024
FTDO-based adaptive fuzzy fixed-time tracking control for uncertain unmanned helicopter with output constraints,"During the actual flight of unmanned helicopters, there are widespread output constraints, system uncertainties and external disturbances, which bring significant threats to their safe flight. To keep the output constraints from violating predefined boundaries, the barrier Lyapunov function (BLF) is utilized in this paper. The system uncertainties are estimated by the fuzzy logic system (FLS). The compound disturbances composed of the external disturbances and the approximation errors caused by FLS are approximated by the fixed-time disturbance observers (FTDOs). According to the analysis of FTDOs and fixed-time stability theory, the observer errors and state errors converge to a region of the origin in fixed-time, and the appropriate parameters of FTDOs and controller are designed to ensure that the disturbance convergence time is faster than the one of the proposed controller, which further improves the stability of the system. Moreover, the convergence time of the FTDOs FTDOs and the proposed approach only depends on the design parameters under any initial conditions with constrained outputs. The performance of the proposed control approach is verified through the simulation results. © 2024 Elsevier Masson SAS",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85186718524&doi=10.1016%2fj.ast.2024.109019&partnerID=40&md5=e16217467584cb1ac18901e338ecf7cd,Aerospace Science and Technology,2024
An improved sand cat swarm optimization for moving target search by UAV,"Moving target search is a challenging dynamic path planning problem. In this scenario, unmanned aerial vehicles endeavor to locate a moving entity based on sensor information, utilizing the optimal path generated by a search algorithm. Based on the Bayesian principle, the task can be transformed into an optimization issue of the fitness function with the maximum probability of capturing the objective. In this study, an improved version of the sand cat swarm optimization algorithm, called the ISCSO search algorithm, is designed to tackle the moving target search issue effectively. Firstly, the presented ISCSO algorithm enhances the planning efficiency of the algorithm by encoding the unmanned aerial vehicle search path information into a set of motion paths through the motion-encoded mechanism. Secondly, the elite pooling strategy and the adaptive T-distribution are constructed to effectively improve the algorithm's ability to escape local optima and enhance its variability. Finally, ISCSO proposes a main architecture that seamlessly merges the search and attack methods of the sand cat swarm optimization algorithm, striking a balance between global and local search capabilities. To evaluate the superiority of the proposed algorithm, nine diverse search scenarios are constructed to verify its performance. The simulation results demonstrate that ISCSO achieves higher detection accuracy and offers more effective search paths for locating dynamic targets in comparison to other well-established metaheuristic algorithms.

A novel framework for detection and prevention of denial of service attacks on autonomous vehicles using fuzzy logic,"Every year, millions of people lose their lives due to road accidents, and countless others suffer from severe injuries. Moreover, these accidents cause economic losses worldwide. Primary reasons for these accidents include over speeding, doziness, distracted driving, drugs, and psychoactive substances. Many efforts are made to automate vehicles to save losses. Autonomous vehicles are expected to revolutionize transportation by reducing the likelihood of accidents resulting from human mistakes, increasing efficiency, and reducing congestion. Like any other computer-based system, autonomous vehicles can be susceptible to attacks that could compromise their safety, security, and privacy. Denial-of-Service (DoS) attack is a cyberattack that aims to disturb a network's typical or standard functioning. A successful DoS attack could cause the autonomous vehicle to malfunction or stop functioning altogether, leading to accidents or other safety risks. To mitigate the risk of DoS attacks, protective measures that have been proposed include encryption, firewalls, and intrusion detection systems. The previous approaches to detect and prevent Denial-of-Service (DoS) attacks in autonomous vehicles are associated with imprecise and inaccurate results and high computational costs. The main goal of this research is to present a novel approach that utilizes fuzzy logic to effectively detect and mitigate Denial of Service (DoS) attacks. The proposed approach has achieved 99.4% detection and prevention rate by attaining optimal levels of security with testing error upto 0.6%. Furthermore, comprehensive execution and validation of security measures have been conducted by adopting the attack surface and rules representation. The presented approach delivers more precise and accurate results while maintaining a lower computational cost than existing methodologies. In future the proposed scheme can be used for detection of other attacks in autonomous vehicles by incorporating relevant input variables and their respective ranges. © 2024 Elsevier Inc.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85185338090&doi=10.1016%2fj.vehcom.2024.100741&partnerID=40&md5=c7501f855a9b390c7503065d30437876,Vehicular Communications,2024
Path Planning for Heterogeneous UAVs with Radar Sensors,"Due to their flexibility and agility, unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) offer a promising approach to cluster planning within wireless sensor networks (WSNs). However, the limited battery capacity of a single UAV limits its application in many situations, such as searching in wild areas. In this article, we propose a computational scheme of cooperative path planning for heterogeneous UAVs based on Voronoi diagrams and intelligent swarm optimization algorithm. In this article: 1) Voronoi diagrams are used to model the field environment according to the radar sensor position; 2) an improved K-medoids algorithm based on the maximum empty circle property of the Voronoi diagram (Vor-K$-medoids) is proposed to complete the reconnaissance UAVs (RUAVs) domain cooperative search; and 3) a hyperbolic tangent heuristic function intelligent optimization algorithm is proposed to calculate the minimum risk path for the attack UAV (AUAV) according to the characteristics of the attack mission. The simulation results show that the proposed scheme integrates the properties of the Voronoi diagram, clustering algorithm, and path planning algorithm commendably. Compared with the traditional ant colony optimization (ACO), under the same number of iterations, the probability of obtaining the optimal track is improved by 14%, and the running time is shortened by 50.87%.The proposed scheme offers a practical and cost-effective approach for efficiently searching areas within large-scale radar sensors in real-world scenarios.  © 2014 IEEE.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85174821887&doi=10.1109%2fJIOT.2023.3324963&partnerID=40&md5=ed7a5ab8f0d804a351239d270806a015,IEEE Internet of Things Journal,2024
Generalizable Stable Points Segmentation for 3D LiDAR Scan-to-Map Long-Term Localization,"Mobile robots increasingly operate in real-world environments that are subject to change over time. Accurate and robust localization is, however, crucial for the effective operation of autonomous mobile systems. In this letter, we tackle the challenge of developing a generalizable learned filter for long-term localization based on scan-to-map matching, using only 3D LiDAR data. Our primary objective is to enhance the reliability of mobile robot localization in dynamic environments. To obtain a strong generalization capability of the learned filter, we exploit the discrepancy between scan and map data. Our approach involves applying sparse 4D convolutions on a joint sparse voxel grid that encompasses both, scan voxels and their corresponding map voxels. This allows us to segment scan points into stable and unstable points based on a predicted long-term stability confidence score for each scan point. Our experimental results demonstrate that utilizing the stable points for localization improves the performance of scan-matching algorithms, especially in environments where changes in appearance are frequent. By exploiting the discrepancy between scan and map voxels, we enhance the segmentation of stable points. As a result, our approach generalizes to new, unseen environments.  © 2016 IEEE.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85186106728&doi=10.1109%2fLRA.2024.3368236&partnerID=40&md5=c19596b6f47a961a0dc2933d8e1c37c8,IEEE Robotics and Automation Letters,2024
Diver Identification Using Anthropometric Data Ratios for Underwater Multi-Human-Robot Collaboration,"Recent advances in efficient design, perception algorithms, and computing hardware have made it possible to create improved human-robot interaction (HRI) capabilities for autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs). To conduct secure missions as underwater human-robot teams, AUVs require the ability to accurately identify divers. However, this remains an open problem due to divers' challenging visual features, mainly caused by similar-looking scuba gear. In this letter, we present a novel algorithm that can perform diver identification using either pre-trained models or models trained during deployment. We exploit anthropometric data obtained from diver pose estimates to generate robust features that are invariant to changes in distance and photometric conditions. We also propose an embedding network that maximizes inter-class distances in the feature space and minimizes those for the intra-class features, which significantly improves classification performance. Furthermore, we present an end-to-end diver identification framework that operates on an AUV and evaluate the accuracy of the proposed algorithm. Quantitative results in controlled-water experiments show that our algorithm achieves a high level of accuracy in diver identification.  © 2016 IEEE.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85187243562&doi=10.1109%2fLRA.2024.3366026&partnerID=40&md5=bdab0525415e6ffb6e28b5c7a0ccfabb,IEEE Robotics and Automation Letters,2024

Social Self-Attention Generative Adversarial Networks for Human Trajectory Prediction,"Predicting accurate human future trajectories is of critical importance for self-driving vehicles if they are to navigate complex scenarios. Trajectories of humans are not only dependent on the humans themselves, but also the interactions with surrounding agents. Previous works mainly model interactions among agents by using a diversity of polymerization methods that integrate various learned agent states hit or miss. In this article, we propose social self-attention generative adversarial networks (Social SAGAN), which generate socially acceptable multimodal trajectory predictions. Social SAGAN incorporates a generator that predicts future trajectories of pedestrians, a discriminator that classifies trajectory predictions as real or fake, and a social self-attention mechanism that selectively refines the most interactive information and helps the overall model to capture what to pay attention to.

Integrated Host- and Content-Centric Routing for Efficient and Scalable Networking of UAV Swarm,"Efficient and scalable networking is a key enabler of the Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) swarms, wherein multiple UAVs cooperatively execute complicated tasks. Despite the intermittent connections due to the UAV mobility, stable paths may exist temporally in periods like formation keeping, which is rarely considered or utilized in existing UAV routing designs. In this article, we propose an integrated host- and content-centric routing (IHCR) mechanism to harness the advantages of both routing mechanisms. Specifically, the routing information of stable paths is reused in a host-centric manner to reduce the flooding for path exploring. In addition, the route failure detection and re-routing are content-centric to adjust to the topology dynamics. The challenges lie in the inherent contradiction between host-centric and content-centric routing mechanisms (e.g., naming spaces) and the tradeoff between path reusing and re-routing. To overcome these challenges, we appropriately incorporate node names into content names and then fully exploit reusable paths via time-based route failure detection and delayed forwarding. Packet-level simulation results show that IHCR increases the packet delivery ratio by 60.1%, and enlarges the achievable network scale by 4.2 times compared to state-of-the-art routing mechanisms. © 2002-2012 IEEE.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85153799448&doi=10.1109%2fTMC.2023.3267451&partnerID=40&md5=d857ccae491333412b8ea6f48972a0a8,IEEE Transactions on Mobile Computing,2024

Imitation learning from imperfect demonstrations for AUV path tracking and obstacle avoidance,"Autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV) is widely used for complex underwater tasks such as seafloor exploration. In recent years, deep reinforcement learning (DRL) has been introduced to the AUV control due to its capability to improve the autonomy of AUV. However, it is usually very difficult to design an effective reward function for the DRL methods. Generative adversarial imitation learning (GAIL) can allow AUVs to learn control policies from expert demonstrations instead of pre-defined reward functions, but suffers from the deficiency of requiring optimal expert demonstrations and not surpassing the provided demonstrations. This paper builds upon the GAIL algorithm for AUV learning control policies from expert demonstrations. We proposed an importance reweighting generative adversarial imitation learning (WGAIL) algorithm by using confidence scores to indicate the optimality of the demonstrated trajectories, which can facilitate AUVs to learn control policies from expert demonstrations of different levels. Our experimental results on a simulated AUV system modeling Sailfish 210 of our lab in the Gazebo simulation environment show that an AUV trained via WGAIL can achieve a better performance than the one trained via GAIL with different levels of expert sub-optimal demonstrations. Moreover, control policies trained via WGAIL in simple tasks can generalize better to complex tasks than those trained via GAIL, greatly extending the applicability of the AUV learning from expert demonstrations. © 2024 Elsevier Ltd",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85186443756&doi=10.1016%2fj.oceaneng.2024.117287&partnerID=40&md5=7dc324ef4b239ca8cf1037cc207ebb91,Ocean Engineering,2024
Unmanned aerial vehicle intrusion detection: Deep-meta-heuristic system,"The UAV (Unmanned Aerial Vehicles) is an automatic aircraft, widely used several applications like emergency management, wildlife conservation, forestry, aerial photography, etc. The communication among the UAV is susceptible to security threats with several diverse attacks. The data sharing among the UAV and other vehicles is vulnerable to jamming and suspicious activities that disturbs the communication. To tackle the issue, IDS (Intrusion Detection System) is the significant system that monitors and identifies the suspicious activities in the communication network. To attain this, several conventional researchers attempted to accomplish better intrusion detection. However, classical models are limited by accuracy, noise and computation. To overcome the limitation, proposed method employs particular set of procedures for the intrusion detection in UAV with Intrusion UAV dataset. The dataset comprise of features like drone speed, height, width, velocity etc. Initially, in the respective approach, GG (Greedy based Genetic) algorithm for feature selection, which maintains the exact balance between the greediness and diversified population.

Leveraging Digital Twin and DRL for Collaborative Context Offloading in C-V2X Autonomous Driving,"Digital Twin (DT) technology, as a promising technology, can achieve the vehicular contexts mapping of the virtual world and physical world in a collaborative autonomous driving (CAD) system. DT technology is developed on the basis of C-V2X, 6G, Mobile Edge Computing (MEC), Machine Learning (ML) and other technologies, which can enable the creation of robust and reliable digital twin-based collaborative autonomous driving architectures, providing a platform for testing, validating, and refining autonomous driving systems in a highly efficient and safe manner. However, the future large-scale CAD system needs greater real-time processing and resource collaboration capability for autonomous vehicles (AVs). Especially considering the mobility of AVs, it puts higher demands on the management of AVs. In this article, we present a digital twin (DT)-based collaborative autonomous driving (DTCAD) three-layer architecture in C-V2X to provide better resource management of AVs. In order to improve the Quality of Service (QoS) and reduce the processing latency in large-scale CAD scenarios, a scalable Deep Reinforcement Learning and Mean Field Game method (DDPG-MFG) are proposed, where the dynamic and real-time interaction between AVs is approximated as a mean-field gaming process in DT resource allocation. Especially, to improve the interaction efficiency between AVs and CAD environment, we design more efficient exploitation and exploration algorithms for AVs. The CARLA simulation demonstrates our proposed algorithm significantly reduces the task offloading latency, and improves the average rewards by 28.5%, 3.5%, and 6.8%, compared with traditional DDPG, TD3, and AC, respectively. © 1967-2012 IEEE.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85177025404&doi=10.1109%2fTVT.2023.3333243&partnerID=40&md5=1a1c94594e55667d34b39474877ee540,IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology,2024
liteGAP: Lightweight Group Authentication Protocol for Internet of Drones Systems,"Over the past few years, the synergic usage of unmanned aerial vehicles (later drones) and Internet of Things (IoT) has successfully transformed into the Internet of Drones (IoD) paradigm, where the data of interest is gathered and delivered to the Zone Service Provider (ZSP) by drones for substantial additional analysis. Considering the sensitivity of collected information and the impact of information disclosure, information privacy and security issues should be resolved properly so that the maximum potential of IoD can be realized in the increasingly complex cyber threat environment. Ideally, an authentication and key agreement protocol can be adopted to establish secure communications between drones and the ZSP in an insecure environment. Nevertheless, a large group of drones authenticating with the ZSP simultaneously will lead to a severe authentication signaling congestion, which inevitably degrades the quality of service (QoS) of IoD systems. To properly address the above-mentioned issues, a lightweight group authentication protocol, called liteGAP, is proposed in this paper. liteGAP can achieve the authenticated key establishment between a group of drones and the ZSP concurrently in the IoD environment using lightweight operations such as hash function, bitwise XOR, and physical unclonable function (PUF). We verify liteGAP using AVISPA (a tool for the automatic verification of security protocols) and conduct formal and informal security analysis, proving that liteGAP meets all pre-defined security requirements and withstand various potential cyber attacks. Moreover, we develop an experimental framework and conduct extensive experiments on liteGAP and two benchmark schemes (e.g., GASE and rampIoD). Experimental findings show that liteGAP outperforms its counterparts in terms of computational cost as well as communication overhead.  © 1967-2012 IEEE.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85178014504&doi=10.1109%2fTVT.2023.3335839&partnerID=40&md5=28e3212d23c88803fe1d82c07794be4c,IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology,2024
Fractional Optimal Control for Malware Propagation in Internet of Underwater Things,"The Internet of Underwater Things (IoUT) relies on wireless communication devices that are arranged in an open underwater environment and can interact with other devices through acoustic communication technology. However, due to their limited resources and open underwater environment, IoUT has been suffering from a high risk of malware attacks. As the two main parts of IoUT, autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs) and underwater wireless rechargeable sensor networks (UWRSNs) are more favored by attackers and can be directly attacked by malware, which can lead to the cross-propagation of malware when AUVs and UWRSNs exchange information. To mitigate that threat, there is an urgent need to study the propagation patterns of malware and control their spread. Therefore, we establish a mathematical model based on the fractional-order theoretical framework to investigate the malware propagation patterns in two coupled networks (UWRSNs and AUVs). Then, we combine immune, charging, and quarantine delays in control and derive the optimal control strategies based on optimal control theory. Moreover, to improve the generality of control, we propose a machine learning (ML) controller that combines ML [e.g., deep neural network (DNN) and random forest (RF)] with control theory. Ultimately, our simulation experiments show that the proposed optimal control strategy is more effective in inhibiting the spread of malware while obtaining the minimum control cost under different fractional-order scenes. At the same time, the ML-based control results are close to the optimal control.  © 2014 IEEE.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85177084319&doi=10.1109%2fJIOT.2023.3331736&partnerID=40&md5=ed636199aff09df4387b0ea15832648b,IEEE Internet of Things Journal,2024
"UAV-Assisted IoT Applications, Cybersecurity Threats, AI-Enabled Solutions, Open Challenges With Future Research Directions","Unnamed Ariel Vehicle-assisted-Internet of Things (UAV-assisted IoT) applications have emerged as a powerful integrated technology, showcasing remarkable results in many domains with numerous advantages. However, this technology encounters several challenges, and security is one of them. Given that, authentication and verification of legitimate devices with data privacy pose key concerns in a wireless communication environment. Even though, the literature highlights the growing security threats of this technology, where attackers can easily compromise the existing authentication and data preservation schemes. Therefore, it is crucial for all involved stakeholders to address these concerns using Artificial Intelligence (AI), Machine Learning (ML), Deep Learning (DL), and Reinforcement Learning (RL) algorithms, as they offer cost-effective solutions. While some algorithms have been used in the literature to accurately and effectively predict, detect, and prevent vulnerabilities in this technology, they may not adequately handle modern or advanced security threats. Therefore, in this article, we provide a comprehensive survey of the existing literature from 2014 to 2022, specifically focusing on AI, ML, DL, and RL-enabled prototypes. Our goal is to highlight the contributions and limitations of the considered articles. Based on our observations, we will emphasize on the open challenges to set the stage for future research to enhance the security of this emerging technology. Moreover, to bridge this gap of all aspects of this technology, we will discuss layer-wise security threats and countermeasure schemes following the TCP/IP stack. Finally, we will compare our work with existing review articles to demonstrate its novelty, uniqueness, and potential usefulness for the people working in this field.  © 2016 IEEE.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85170564384&doi=10.1109%2fTIV.2023.3309548&partnerID=40&md5=fa3227c664c6a40e5438d4d145a8db84,IEEE Transactions on Intelligent Vehicles,2024
DivaCAN: Detecting in-vehicle intrusion attacks on a controller area network using ensemble learning,"The controller area network (CAN) protocol is a critical communication mechanism in vehicular systems. However, the widespread adoption of this protocol has introduced vulnerabilities to in-vehicle communication channels, making them susceptible to various security threats, including denial-of-service, fuzzy, and impersonation attacks. There is thus an urgent need to develop effective security measures to counter these threats. Unfortunately, existing approaches to attack detection suffer from shortcomings such as suboptimal accuracy and high false-positive rates. Herein, we propose a novel methodology to address these limitations, DivaCAN. DivaCAN leverages an ensemble of classifiers, including deep neural networks, the multi-layer perceptron, the light gradient-boosting machine, extra trees, random forest, and Bagging, along with k-nearest neighbors, for intrusion-attack recognition on the CAN bus. The DivaCAN model was thoroughly evaluated, and its exceptional performance, which surpasses that of the latest methodologies, was demonstrated. It was found to achieve a precision of 94.93%, a recall of 94.98%, and an F1 score of 94.97%. One notable aspect of this research is the emphasis on achieving a low false-positive rate, which is often overlooked by other methodologies. Additionally, the DivaCAN model was found to exhibit an acceptable execution time of 406 s, highlighting the importance of considering both accuracy and efficiency when evaluating the performance of classification models. This study thus significantly enhances the security of in-vehicle communication on the CAN protocol. DivaCAN is a robust and accurate intrusion-detection system that addresses the pressing need for effective security measures in vehicular systems. © 2024 Elsevier Ltd",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85182734874&doi=10.1016%2fj.cose.2024.103712&partnerID=40&md5=c8fdb13a29d093320c3ba59d7bd2784a,Computers and Security,2024
A Privacy-Preserving Collaborative Jamming Attacks Detection Framework Using Federated Learning,"Jamming attacks are becoming increasingly common and pose a significant threat to the security and reliability of wireless sensor networks (WSNs). These attacks can be difficult to detect, as they often operate in a stealthy manner, disrupting communication between sensors. Artificial intelligence (AI) techniques have the potential to be highly effective in detecting jamming attacks. However, the adoption of AI-based techniques for detecting jamming attacks has been limited due to the scarcity of up-to-date and accurate data of these attacks. Privacy-aware collaboration among agents is expected to be essential in building robust AI-based models for detecting jamming attacks in WSNs. In this context, we propose a novel framework that uses collaborative federated learning (FL) to enable privacy-aware distributed learning among multiple agents without sharing their sensitive data. This can be particularly important in jamming attack detection, where data may contain sensitive information that should not be shared. In addition, we design a novel secure aggregation scheme to protect the FL aggregation service from reverse-engineering attacks. The effectiveness of our proposed framework was tested using the public Wireless Sensor Networks Dataset (WSN-DS) that includes four types of well-known jamming attacks (i.e., constant jamming, reactive jamming, random jamming, and deceptive jamming). The results of a thorough experiment using the WSN-DS data set demonstrate the effectiveness and high accuracy/F1-score (99%) in detecting jamming attacks while also maintaining participant privacy.  © 2014 IEEE.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85178053508&doi=10.1109%2fJIOT.2023.3333870&partnerID=40&md5=81ff1927ee14a42aeb725cd067f0f0ce,IEEE Internet of Things Journal,2024
Collaborative Data Acquisition for UAV-Aided IoT Based on Time-Balancing Scheduling,"The emergence of the Internet of Things (IoT) has revolutionized various domains by enabling seamless connectivity and real-time data exchange between connected IoT devices. However, in sparse deployment scenarios where sensor nodes (SNs) are sparsely distributed, ensuring low data delivery latency becomes a significant challenge. Our research aims to address this issue by utilizing unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) to support IoT networks. In the existing UAV-aided IoT systems, all UAVs are required to return to the base station (BS) to deliver data, which results in significant data delivery latency. To overcome this limitation, we propose a collaborative data acquisition model that uses air-to-air data relay between UAVs. By leveraging the mobility and agility of UAVs, the proposed system facilitates efficient data relay between SNs and the BS. To further optimize the performance of the system, we present a time-balancing scheduling data acquisition (TSDA) scheme. This scheme combines a centripetal-based relay pairing method for UAVs to achieve seamless data relay and a joint scheduling scheme to minimize the hovering time during data delivery. Through extensive simulations, we demonstrate that the proposed TSDA scheme can achieve lower data delivery latency in sparse deployment scenarios compared to existing data acquisition schemes. In addition, the joint scheduling scheme can significantly reduce the hovering time of UAVs so that the collaborative relaying advantage can be better exploited.  © 2014 IEEE.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85179829158&doi=10.1109%2fJIOT.2023.3339136&partnerID=40&md5=c249551222de2fcc0bec9e012c32c9cf,IEEE Internet of Things Journal,2024
AI-Based Sensor Attack Detection and Classification for Autonomous Vehicles in 6G-V2X Environment,"Autonomous Vehicles (AVs) mainly rely on sensor data and are anticipated to transform the transportation sector. The abnormal sensor readings generated by malicious cyberattacks or defective vehicle sensors can result in deadly crashes. This paper proposes a Sensor Attack Detection and Classification (SADC) framework in a 6G-V2X environment to examine the cybersecurity concern for AVs against sensor attacks. The SADC framework employs GPS and LiDAR sensor attack detectors and the Pattern-based Attack Classification (PAC) algorithm. It combats new-age cyberattacks and provides an accurate sensor attack detection and classification mechanism in AVs. A protocol-based attack detection scheme in SADC is developed to identify the abnormal source sensor based on the detector’s results. The PAC algorithm classifies malicious sensors by analyzing different strategies: instant, constant, bias, and gradual drift. The results show that the SADC framework has a 0.98% higher accuracy than the existing counterparts in detecting attacks and classifying them efficiently.. © 2023 IEEE.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85178002682&doi=10.1109%2fTVT.2023.3334257&partnerID=40&md5=020937b39b791d8f22e41c46ac9c1a46,IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology,2024
Adversarial deep reinforcement learning based robust depth tracking control for underactuated autonomous underwater vehicle,"In this paper, an adversarial deep reinforcement learning-based control method is proposed to address the issue of robust depth tracking of an underactuated autonomous underwater vehicle in the presence of intrinsic coupled dynamics and external disturbances. First, long-short-term-memory neural network is presented to memorize and predict the changes in the state of vehicle, and a cascaded multilayer perception projects the output into action space of vehicle. Subsequently, adversarial deep reinforcement learning scheme is applied to the training of control agent by introducing an adversary which counteracts the control behavior, whereby the agent is enabled to learn the control strategy in different distributions of state transition. For evaluation of the performance, a control agent is pre-trained in simulation environment based on the reliable digital model of a real vehicle, and the simulation environment is paced at one iteration per second to align with real-time operations to ensure the portability of training result. Furthermore, the training cost is also extremely reduced. Finally, experiments are conducted with time-varying disturbances to further prove the feasibility of the proposed learning-based control scheme on a prototype of underwater vehicle in towing tank. Moreover, comparative experiment results show the better robustness performance of the learning-based control agent than that of classic line-of-sight based proportional–integral–derivative and adaptive line-of-sight based proportional–integral–derivative controllers in different scenarios. © 2023 Elsevier Ltd",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85181166595&doi=10.1016%2fj.engappai.2023.107728&partnerID=40&md5=c781429bef47521b335c311c9945fa3c,Engineering Applications of Artificial Intelligence,2024
Resilient Control for Networked Unmanned Surface Vehicles With Dynamic Event-Triggered Mechanism Under Aperiodic DoS Attacks,"This article investigates the problem of resilient dynamic event-triggered control for networked unmanned surface vehicles (USVs) with external disturbance in the presence of transmission delay and aperiodic DoS attacks. First, a network-based USV control system model is constructed and converted into a state space. Second, a resilient dynamic event-triggered scheme is designed to save system communication resources under aperiodic DoS attacks. Third, to ensure the security of the networked USV control system and to block communication with unknown jamming signals, a time-delay switching system model based on resilient event-triggered mechanism under aperiodic DoS attack is established. Then, by combining the Lyapunov method and linear matrix inequalities (LMIs), the criterion for asymptotic stability analysis and controller synthesis conditions of the resulting switching system is derived.

A Subarray Selection Scheme for Cellular-Connected UAV With Conformal Phased Array Antenna,"In this article, the millimeter wave (mmWave) cellular-connected unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) equipped with conformal phased array antennas in cylindrical shape is investigated, where the UAV acts as an aerial user and served by the base station (BS). Although the cylindrical conformal array (CCA)-enabled UAV can achieve the full spatial coverage and fully exploit the beam gain with directional antenna elements, the curved carrier of conformal array forces the cellular-connected UAV to activate only a portion of antenna elements rather than activating the entire of them to mitigate the severe aerial-ground interference from other BSs. The subarray selection problem is formulated to maximize signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR) with nonlinear antenna radiation patterns. To handle the nonlinearity of objective problem, we propose a low-complexity subarray selection scheme based on the genetic algorithm (GA), which utilizes only the information that UAV can acquire in practical scenarios. The simulation results demonstrate that the proposed subarray selection scheme always shows higher SINR and achievable rate compared to the benchmark schemes. Specifically, the proposed subarray selection scheme shows an achievable rate that is about 2% higher than the accelerated particle swarm optimization (APSO) algorithm, and its computational complexity is only about 25%. In addition, the proposed scheme has near optimal performance while having only about 10.4% complexity compared to the optimal subarray obtained through the full search.  © 2014 IEEE.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85184830764&doi=10.1109%2fJIOT.2023.3337875&partnerID=40&md5=f90f5b1cbff339f8191b05f4439f3ee4,IEEE Internet of Things Journal,2024
Event-Based Distributed Secure Control of Unmanned Surface Vehicles with DoS Attacks,"This study investigates the distributed secure control problem of multiple unmanned surface vehicles (USVs) in the presence of wave-induced disturbances and unified abrupt and incipient rudder angle faults in physical layer, and aperiodic Denial-of-Service (DoS) attacks in cyber layer. Multi-USVs with rudder angle fault and DoS attack modeling are first established. Then, the decentralized unknown input observer (UIO)-based fault estimation and distributed secure control approach is developed in a co-designed framework for multi-USVs with cyber-physical threats. Advantages of the proposed secure scheme are: 1) actuator faults, DoS attacks, and event-Triggering strategies with varying action instants, durations, and locations are synchronously addressed and 2) the criteria of exponential consensus are derived by virtue of attack frequency and average dwelling time technique without prior knowledge of unknown wave-induced perturbation bounds and elimination of Zeno behavior in an event-based mechanism.

An Efficient Approach With Dynamic Multiswarm of UAVs for Forest Firefighting,"This article proposes the multiswarm cooperative information-driven search and divide and conquer mitigation control (MSCIDC) approach for faster detection and mitigation of forest fires by reducing the loss of biodiversity, nutrients, soil moisture, and other intangible benefits. A swarm is a cooperative group of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) flying together to search and quench the fire areas effectively. The multiswarm cooperative information-driven search uses a two-stage search comprising cooperative information-driven exploration and exploitation for quick/accurate detection of fire locations. The search level is selected based on the thermal sensor information about the potential fire area. The dynamic nature of swarms acquired from global regulative repulsion and merging between swarms reduces the detection and mitigation time compared to the existing methods. The local attraction among the swarm members helps the nondetector members reach the fire location faster, and divide-and-conquer mitigation control ensures a nonoverlapping fire sector allocation for all members quenching the fire. The performance of the MSCIDC has been compared with different multi- UAV methods using a simulated pine forest environment. The Monte-Carlo simulation results indicate that the MSCIDC reduces the average forest area burnt by 65% and mission time by 60% compared to the best case of the multi- UAV approaches, guaranteeing a faster and more successful mission.  © 2013 IEEE.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85184314950&doi=10.1109%2fTSMC.2024.3352660&partnerID=40&md5=4a6d6346b7ed0a1065ff5f7bbceda9ce,"IEEE Transactions on Systems, Man, and Cybernetics: Systems",2024
UAV-Aided Secure Communication With Imperfect Eavesdropper Location: Robust Design for Jamming Power and Trajectory,"This paper exploits the mobility of an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) to improve the physical layer (PLS) security against potential eavesdropping scenarios, where the sensitive data transmitted from a ground base station (GBS) to multiple information receivers (IRs) is easily eavesdropped by multiple non-colluding eavesdroppers (Eves). Specifically, the UAV is employed as a friendly jammer to transmit artificial noise to degrade the wiretap channels. By leveraging the UAV's mobility and the possibility of establishing line-of-sight links, the UAV can move close to the Eves and opportunistically jam them. Especially, two practical factors, namely, the imperfect location information of Eves and the existence of no-fly zones are considered. Since only the partial position information of the Eves can be known, as the worst case, the minimum average secrecy rate of IRs is robustly optimized by jointly designing the trajectory and jamming power of the UAV, and the transmission power of the GBS to ensure the security of all IRs. However, the formulated problem with coupled variables is non-convex and intractable. As such, an efficient alternative iterative suboptimal algorithm is proposed to solve this problem by applying the block coordinate descent, successive convex approximation, slack variables, and mathcal {S}-Procedure. Numerical results reveal that the proposed robust algorithm can substantially improve the max-min average secrecy rate, and the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm is further verified by comparing it with three benchmark schemes.  © 1967-2012 IEEE.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85181572608&doi=10.1109%2fTVT.2023.3347769&partnerID=40&md5=0ffc3036a4f824d4629aa556876b17a5,IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology,2024
Double-loop LQR depth tracking control of underactuated AUV: Methodology and comparative experiments,"In this paper, a double-loop depth tracking control scheme based on linear quadratic regulator (LQR) is proposed for underactuated autonomous underwater vehicles (AUV). The motivation is to address the problem that the classic single-loop LQR depth controller which is easy to use in practice yet cannot effectively overcome the underactuated AUV features and complex disturbances. First, a double-loop depth control framework is proposed which divides complex disturbances into outer-loop kinematic disturbances and inner-loop dynamic disturbances. Second, the adaptive line-of-sight (ALOS) guidance law is designed in the outer loop to account for the underactuated characteristics. The depth tracking error is converted to the desired pitch and the kinematic disturbance caused by the unknown angle of attack is compensated. Furthermore, based on the linear model in the inner-loop, a concise LQR method is designed to track the desired pitch. Meanwhile, an extended state observer (ESO) is introduced to estimate dynamic disturbances such as model nonlinearity, uncertainty and external environmental disturbances. Finally, the proposed scheme is validated by tank test and compared with the single-loop LQR method. The experiment results show that the proposed double-loop depth tracking method can effectively overcome complex disturbances and the depth tracking accuracy is increased by 83%. © 2024 Elsevier Ltd",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85187557557&doi=10.1016%2fj.oceaneng.2024.117410&partnerID=40&md5=ec10f7b38e99c508508716e2bd3d3083,Ocean Engineering,2024
MMAF-Net: Multi-view multi-stage adaptive fusion for multi-sensor 3D object detection,"In this paper, we propose a 3D object detection method called MMAF-Net that is based on the multi-view and multi-stage adaptive fusion of RGB images and LiDAR point cloud data. This is an end-to-end architecture, which combines the characteristics of RGB images, the front view of point clouds based on reflection intensity, and the bird's eye view of point clouds. It also adopts a multi-stage fusion approach of “data-level fusion + feature-level fusion” to fully exploit the strength of multimodal information. Our proposed method addresses key challenges found in current 3D object detection methods for autonomous driving, including insufficient feature extraction from multimodal data, rudimentary fusion techniques, and sensitivity to distance and occlusion. To ensure the comprehensive integration of multimodal information, we present a series of targeted fusion methods. Firstly, we propose a novel input form that encodes dense point cloud reflectivity information into the image to enhance its representational power. Secondly, we design the Region Attention Adaptive Fusion module utilizing an attention mechanism to guide the network in adaptively adjusting the importance of different features. Finally, we extend the 2D DIOU (Distance Intersection over Union) loss function to 3D and develop a joint regression loss based on 3D_DIOU and SmoothL1 to optimize the similarity between detected and ground truth boxes.

Underactuated MSV path following control via stable adversarial inverse reinforcement learning,"Model-based control approaches are inadequate to solve the marine surface vehicle (MSV) path-following problem, especially under adverse environments. To effectively deal with the MSV path-following problem, model-free deep reinforcement learning (DRL) based methods have been developed. However, defining an efficient reward function for DRL in path following tasks is rather difficult. Providing expert demonstration is often easier than designing effective reward functions. Thus, we propose a model-free stable adversarial inverse reinforcement learning (SAIRL) algorithm that only adopts the state of MSV and reconstructs the reward function from the expert demonstration. The SAIRL algorithm is designed to guarantee the prescribed MSV path following accuracy and training stability. It utilizes an alternative loss function and dual-discriminator framework to dissolve the issue of policy collapse, which arises due to the vanishing gradient of the discriminator. Simulations and experiments have validated that the SAIRL algorithm outperforms other baseline algorithms in terms of path-following accuracy and stability of convergence. © 2024 Elsevier Ltd",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85186318389&doi=10.1016%2fj.oceaneng.2024.117368&partnerID=40&md5=2f118ba662ae105cf9a5130e8d0d10ce,Ocean Engineering,2024
Stochastic Non-Autoregressive Transformer-Based Multi-Modal Pedestrian Trajectory Prediction for Intelligent Vehicles,"Pedestrian trajectory prediction, which aims at predicting the future positions of all pedestrians in a crowd scene given their past trajectories, is the cornerstone of autonomous driving and intelligent transportation systems. Accurate prediction and fast inference are both indispensable for real-world applications. In this paper, we propose a stochastic non-autoregressive Transformer-based multi-modal trajectory prediction model to address the two challenges. Specifically, a novel graph attention module dedicated to joint learning of social and temporal interaction is proposed to explore the complex interaction among pedestrians while integrating sparse attention mechanism, pedestrian identity, and temporal order contained in the trajectory data. By doing so, the interaction across temporal and social dimensions can be simultaneously processed to extract abundant context features for prediction. Besides, to accelerate inference speed, we put forward a stochastic non-autoregressive Transformer model with multi-modal prediction capability where each future trajectory can be inferred in a parallel fashion, therefore, resulting in diverse trajectory predictions and less computational cost. Extensive experiments and ablation studies are performed to evaluate our approach. The empirical results demonstrate that the proposed model not only produces high prediction accuracy but also infers with fast speed.

Optimization of high-speed fixed-wing UAV penetration strategy based on deep reinforcement learning,"The penetration decision of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) is one of the key components for UAVs to detect or strike crucial targets in adversarial environments. Presently, most methods lack research on penetration decisions under unknown interception information. The executing UAV for decision-making is generally a simplified three-degree-of-freedom model. The decision format is often simplified to path point optimization, lacking control over the stability of complex model attitudes and exhibiting relatively poor robustness. This paper proposes a penetration relative motion theory and aircraft control method based on the six-degrees-of-freedom UAV model to reduce response errors between algorithm control decisions and actual flight control. Using a Markov decision process, a UAV penetration decision control method based on an attitude-overload control loop is designed. This method combines reinforcement learning techniques to enable autonomous penetration decision-making and control for UAVs facing active defense scenarios, enhancing the autonomy, accuracy, and generalization of UAV online decision-making. The paper concludes by implementing autonomous decision-making and control for UAV penetration through the integration of interceptor trajectory prediction with proximal policy optimization. This method reduces the dependency of penetration strategies on interceptor information, ensuring both the generalization ability of penetration strategy models under uncertain information and the consistency of decision stability. Through simulations and experiments, we verified that the penetration strategy based on the pre-sampling PPO method improves the penetration effect by 15.44 % on average and the hit rate by 18.48 %. Moreover, the probability of penetration in different scenarios exceeds 70 %, and the penetration effect is improved by more than 10 % in the case of multiple interceptors. This paper also analyzes the impact of interceptor spatial distribution and the quantity of interceptors on the effectiveness of UAV penetration decision-making. © 2024 Elsevier Masson SAS",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85189663621&doi=10.1016%2fj.ast.2024.109089&partnerID=40&md5=b22775659beaef29e68e902bd4d513de,Aerospace Science and Technology,2024
A PUF and Fuzzy Extractor-Based UAV-Ground Station and UAV-UAV Authentication Mechanism with Intelligent Adaptation of Secure Sessions,"It is crucial that communication between an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) and the ground station (GS) be secure, and both devices should mutually authenticate each other to ensure that an adversary cannot obtain communicated information. Moreover, dynamically adapting the session time of an authenticated session can decrease the idle time of a session and consequently reduce the window of opportunity for an adversary to interfere with the communication link. In light of these considerations, we design a physically unclonable function (PUF) and fuzzy extractor-based UAV-GS authentication mechanism called UAV Authentication with Adaptive Session (UAAS). In UAAS, both UAV-GS and UAV-UAV authentication are two-way. We use a Thompson Sampling (TS)-based approach to intelligently adapt the duration of a session. Both formal and informal security proofs are presented along with a computation and communication cost analysis to analyze the performance of UAAS. It is noted that UAAS is secure against various well-known attacks and has a lower communication cost than several baseline mechanisms. Due to the noise reduction that occurs in PUFs, the computational cost of UAAS is higher than that of baselines that ignore noise. Also, our simulation shows that UAAS significantly outperforms baselines when it comes to network performance.  © 2002-2012 IEEE.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85162700722&doi=10.1109%2fTMC.2023.3284216&partnerID=40&md5=7f70ea29fdfd970031c4b2003aa40783,IEEE Transactions on Mobile Computing,2024
UAV Coverage Path Planning With Quantum-Based Recurrent Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient,"This study proposes quantum-based deep deterministic policy gradient (Q-DDPG) and quantum-based recurrent DDPG (Q-RDDPG) schemes for time-series optimization in UAV communications. Herein, Q-DDPG-based actor-critic reinforcement learning is utilized to optimize action selections in a large state and continuous action space. In this scheme, quantum models are exploited to reduce computational complexity and training loss. As a particular case, Q-DDPG and Q-RDDPG are employed for trajectory optimization and dynamic resource allocation in UAV communications. The results demonstrate that Q-DDPG and Q-RDDPG schemes achieved higher rewards with lower training losses compared to classical DDPG. © 1967-2012 IEEE.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85181578178&doi=10.1109%2fTVT.2023.3347219&partnerID=40&md5=e563d40a0be3bc00018ad1e7ca514f13,IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology,2024
A GPU-accelerated 3dBEM supporting the optimization of actively morphing flapping-foil thrusters with application to AUV propulsion,"In recent years, flapping thrusters have been getting attention as an eco-friendly alternative to conventional propellers for autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs) mainly due to their low-frequency operation, advanced maneuverability, and high efficiency. Their operating principle mimics the thrust-producing kinematics found among efficient swimmers in the aquatic environment. The present work focuses on the analysis and optimization of flapping systems with active morphing features for increased performance. The two optimization studies refer to a realistic AUV propulsion scenario for a wing thruster with active hydrofoil-section adjustment, spanwise bend and twist morphing capabilities. A gradient descent approach based on sequential quadratic programming (SQP) is used for optimal tuning of design variables (planform shape, kinematics) targeting efficiency maximization under thrust and effective angle of attack constraints. For the evaluation of each candidate thruster the unsteady boundary element solver 3dBEM is developed and used for wing performance prediction. The solver exploits GPU parallel computation techniques to reduce computational time and enable fast optimization. Results indicate that the optimal thruster with chordline/spanwise bending is 25% more efficient, whereas the same result for the wing with spanwise bending and twist profiles is up to 8.8%. The 3dBEM solver can support the preliminary design process of morphing flapping-foil thrusters. © 2024 Elsevier Ltd",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85187962809&doi=10.1016%2fj.oceaneng.2024.117513&partnerID=40&md5=f9072f1824f926893bd9beb3fe43020b,Ocean Engineering,2024
TBAC: A Tokoin-Based Accountable Access Control Scheme for the Internet of Things,"Overprivilege Attack, a widely reported phenomenon in IoT that accesses unauthorized or excessive resources, is notoriously hard to prevent, trace and mitigate. In this paper, we propose TBAC, a Tokoin-Based Access Control model enabled by blockchain and Trusted Execution Environment (TEE) technologies, to offer fine-grained access control and strong auditability for IoT. TBAC materializes the virtual access power into a definite-amount, secure and accountable cryptographic coin, termed 'tokoin' (token+coin), and manages it using atomic and accountable state-transition functions in a blockchain. A tokoin carries a fine-grained policy defined by the resource owner to specify the requirements to be satisfied before an access is granted, and the behavioral constraints that describe the correct procedure to follow during access. The strong-auditability is achieved with blockchain and a TEE-enabled trusted access control object (TACO) to ensure that all access activities are securely monitored and auditable. We prototype TBAC by implementing all its functions with well-studied cryptographic primitives over different blockchain platforms, building a TACO on top of the ARM Cortex-M33 TEE microcontroller, and constructing a user-friendly APP for regular users. A case study is finally presented to demonstrate how TBAC is employed to enable autonomous and secure in-home cargo delivery.  © 2002-2012 IEEE.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85172988386&doi=10.1109%2fTMC.2023.3316622&partnerID=40&md5=eed154c9b106e951b781ec2ad35370ce,IEEE Transactions on Mobile Computing,2024
In-Vehicle Network Intrusion Detection System Using CAN Frame-Aware Features,"With the advancement of connected and automated vehicles (CAVs), drivers now have access to convenient features such as lane-keeping, cruise control, and more. The electronic control units (ECUs) equipped within vehicles communicate with each other through the controller area network (CAN). However, since the CAN does not possess any security mechanisms, it becomes a target for adversaries to attack. In light of this, a significant amount of research regarding intrusion detection systems (IDSs) has focused on detecting such maliciously injected CAN packets. Nevertheless, most existing machine learning-based IDSs neither calculate the exact time intervals of the CAN packets nor utilize the counter information. Precise timing intervals are a crucial feature for detecting spoofing, fuzzing, and replay attacks, and counter information is also a significant feature that can detect fuzzing and replay attacks. Therefore, in this paper, we propose a methodology for extracting two detection features that are aware of CAN frame characteristics: The interframe space (IFS) between two consecutive CAN packets, and the counter information of a CAN data payload (i.e., data field). Using these features, we introduce decision tree-based IDS. We evaluate the proposed features with popular decision tree-based models such as random forest and extreme gradient boosting (XGBoost). The results show that our proposed IDS can detect maliciously injected CAN packets with an F1 score of 99.54% in binary classification and 97.99% in multi-class classification, which are higher scores than what existing machine/deep learning-based IDSs achieve. Additionally, we measure the detection time of our proposed IDS in both online and offline testing environments.  © 2000-2011 IEEE.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85174843725&doi=10.1109%2fTITS.2023.3323622&partnerID=40&md5=670604822a2d9dac54cbd621dddecc63,IEEE Transactions on Intelligent Transportation Systems,2024
SAFENESS: A Semi-Supervised Transfer Learning Approach for Sea State Estimation Using Ship Motion Data,"Autonomous vessels have been identified as a promising innovation in advancing marine transportation, providing an effective means to mitigate the risk of accidents, pollution incidents, and carbon dioxide emissions. Accurate sea state estimation (SSE) plays a critical role in facilitating onboard decision-making and optimizing operational efficiency for autonomous ships. Traditional SSE approaches relying on external sensors, such as wave buoys and wave radars, are limited by cost considerations. Model-based methods are highly relying on the understanding of human knowledge to ships. Data-driven models also provide promising solutions, but their generalization is low. To address this challenge, a semi-supervised transfer learning approach for SSE (SAFENESS) is proposed. The model is trained using sufficient data in the source ship and limited data from the target ship and finally applied to the target ship. A data alignment algorithm is utilized to use the limited data of the target ship. To enhance the learning capability of the framework, two attention mechanisms are proposed, and a multi-class adversarial discriminator is introduced that can align the distributions of different domains. The effectiveness of our approach is validated through comprehensive comparisons with eleven established transfer learning methods, demonstrating the superiority of our model. The competitiveness of the proposed attention modules is verified by comparing them with state-of-the-art attention modules. The significance of each component and the influence of key parameters have been thoroughly explored in the ablation and sensitivity analysis. Our method has potential applications in maritime safety, navigation, and operation optimization.  © 2000-2011 IEEE.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85181559831&doi=10.1109%2fTITS.2023.3326281&partnerID=40&md5=d77a03916c49786a4686ab3c09d0db24,IEEE Transactions on Intelligent Transportation Systems,2024
Evaluating the security of CAPTCHAs utilized on Bangladeshi websites,"A number of attacks such as spamming, email-address harvesting, dictionary attacks, brute-force attacks, credential surfing attacks, DOS attacks and others can be executed relatively easily if the target system cannot differentiate between requests coming from a real human user and those generated artificially by bots. In order to distinguish between human users and bots, the Completely Automatic Public Turing Test (CAPTCHA) has been used for almost 20 years. Nevertheless, CAPTCHA can be easily broken if it lacks security features. Consequently, the motivation for utilizing CAPTCHA is undermined. This article proposes a framework that can evaluate the security aspects of text CAPTCHAs. The effectiveness of the framework is validated by using a generalized attack method consisting of pre-processing and utilizing an Optical Character Recognition (OCR) library such as Tesseract OCR. We have carried out a systematic study of existing CAPTCHAs utilized on Bangladeshi websites. We have studied 238 Bangladeshi websites and found that only 44 websites used a CAPTCHA mechanism. Then, we have assessed the security levels of the selected text CAPTCHAs by the proposed framework. As per our analysis, we have found that there are 29 different CAPTCHA schemes being adopted on Bangladeshi websites and among them 23 are vulnerable to automated attacks. In order to address these issues, we also present a number of recommendations. © 2024 Elsevier Ltd",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85186268307&doi=10.1016%2fj.cose.2024.103774&partnerID=40&md5=2ef439f978bb2e20a9f19c2af1ff833b,Computers and Security,2024
Sea-IoUTracker: A more stable and reliable maritime target tracking scheme for unmanned vessel platforms,"Background: As mankind continues to exploit marine resources, there is a growing need to use unmanned surface vessel (USV) platforms for maritime security and surveillance of the operational environment at sea. Satellite remote sensing imagery is now the most common means used for maritime surface security surveillance. Satellite images are susceptible to cloud cover, while camera-equipped USVs can prevent the effects caused by cloud cover. However, there are virtually no vision-based target tracking solutions for the USV perspective. Methods: This paper proposes a tracking solution for multiple target tracking at sea named Sea-IouTracker. It can address the potential problems when the USVs are at sea, such as the target loss, anchor frame drift and even serious Re-ID phenomena due to wind and waves and other environmental effects. We chose Sort as the basic tracking framework and we picked Buffered-IoUs based on two different buffer scales instead of traditional IoUs for matching targets in neighbouring frames. And the innovation of the neighbouring frame matching mechanism lies on that the position of the Buffered-IoU is predicted using a motion prediction model and matched with the next detection frame because both matches are unsuccessful. This method increases the stability of the tracking model and reduces the phenomenon of re-ID. We have also developed a detector that adaptively fuses image features for the tracking scheme. The detector proposed is based on the ASFF (Adaptively Spatial Feature Fusion) detector head, CBAM (Convolutional Block Attention Module) and Yolov7 baseline for maritime target detection. Results and Conclusions: This paper verifies that the Sea-IoUTracker can achieve MOTA = 77.5, ID SW = 1.5% when tracking multiple targets on the MOT17 dataset. We have also proved our detector proposed is superior to other SOTA detectors in accuracy when detecting sea surface targets in the Singapore Maritime Dataset (SMD). We have also verified that the target tracking scheme proposed in this paper outperforms to the current state-of-the-art(SOTA) tracker C-BIoU (Yang et al., 2022) Tracker and ByteTrack based on four tracking video sequences in SMD. In this case, the accuracy is improved by about 2% with respect to the latter, while the ID SW phenomenon is reduced by about 20%. © 2024 Elsevier Ltd",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85186710515&doi=10.1016%2fj.oceaneng.2024.117243&partnerID=40&md5=10ab3707f18757e5142d0147f1ae9841,Ocean Engineering,2024
Α tool for requirements engineering using ontologies and boilerplates,"The most popular technique for specification requirements is natural language. The disadvantage of natural language is ambiguity. Boilerplates are syntactic patterns which limit the ambiguity problem associated with using natural language to specify system/software requirements. Also, using boilerplates is considered a useful tool for inexperienced engineers to define requirements. Using linguistic boilerplates, constrains the natural language syntactically. Furthermore, a domain-specific ontology is used to constrain requirements semantically, as well. In requirements specification, using ontologies helps to restrict the vocabulary to entities, properties, and property relationships which are semantically related. The above results in avoiding or making fewer mistakes. This work makes use of the combination of boilerplate and ontology. Usually, the attributes of boilerplates are completed with the help of the ontology. The contribution of this paper is that the whole boilerplates is stored in the ontology and attributes and fixed elements are part of the ontology. This combination helps to correct semantically and syntactically requirement construction. This paper proposes a tool based on a domain-specific ontology and a set of predefined generic linguistic boilerplates for requirements engineering. We create a domain-specific ontology and a minimal set of boilerplates for an ATM (Automated Teller Machine). We carried out an experiment in order to obtain evidence for the effectiveness and efficiency of our method. The experiment took the form of a case study for the ATM domain and our proposed method was evaluated by users. The contribution and novelty of our methodology is that we created a tool for defining requirements that integrates boilerplate templates and an ontology. We exploit the boilerplate language syntax, mapping them to Resource Description Framework triples which have also a linguistic nature. © 2023, The Author(s).",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85177452198&doi=10.1007%2fs10515-023-00403-y&partnerID=40&md5=dc942858f27b3c87de33b9035a5b72fb,Automated Software Engineering,2024
Learning-Based Autonomous Channel Access in the Presence of Hidden Terminals,"We consider the problem of autonomous channel access (AutoCA), where a group of terminals tries to discover a communication strategy with an access point (AP) via a common wireless channel in a distributed fashion. Due to the irregular topology and the limited communication range of terminals, a practical challenge for AutoCA is the hidden terminal problem, which is notorious in wireless networks for deteriorating throughput and delay performances. To meet the challenge, this paper presents a new multi-agent deep reinforcement learning paradigm, dubbed MADRL-HT, tailored for AutoCA in the presence of hidden terminals. MADRL-HT exploits topological insights and transforms the observation space of each terminal into a scalable form independent of the number of terminals. To compensate for the partial observability, we put forth a look-back mechanism such that the terminals can infer behaviors of their hidden terminals from the carrier-sensed channel states as well as feedback from the AP. A window-based global reward function is proposed, whereby the terminals are instructed to maximize the system throughput while balancing the terminals' transmission opportunities over the course of learning. Considering short-packet machine-type communications, extensive numerical experiments verified the superior performance of our solution benchmarked against the legacy carrier-sense multiple access with collision avoidance (CSMA/CA) protocol. © 2002-2012 IEEE.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85161571451&doi=10.1109%2fTMC.2023.3282790&partnerID=40&md5=9bab4bebbd3ba832b39911501ddd3f27,IEEE Transactions on Mobile Computing,2024
Hierarchical vector transformer vehicle trajectories prediction with diffusion convolutional neural networks,"In dynamic and interactive autonomous driving scenarios, accurately predicting the future movements of vehicle agents is crucial. However, current methods often fail to capture trajectory uncertainty, leading to limitations in trajectory prediction performance. To address these limitations, this paper introduces the hierarchical vector transformer diffusion model, a novel trajectory prediction method that prioritizes both speed and accuracy. The proposed model decomposes the traffic scene modeling into local patches and global interactions, allowing for the acquisition of relevant environmental and global information. Moreover, a local diffusion encoder is employed to effectively capture the aleatoric uncertainty. The proposed model utilizes an adaptive graph structure to exploit the spatial and temporal relationships inherent in the trajectory data. By employing a graph diffusion process, the model effectively captures dynamic features from the historical trajectory information. Moreover, the model demonstrates adaptability by dynamically adjusting to diverse trajectory data and scenarios, thereby enabling the generation of predicted trajectories that are uncertainty aware. This approach contributes to more effective and efficient modeling of dynamic autonomous driving scenarios. Experimental results demonstrate the superior speed and accuracy of the proposed method compared to existing approaches for trajectory prediction. The proposed method significantly enhances prediction accuracy, achieving results of ADE 0.68 and FDE 1.02 on the Argoverse dataset. In comparison to the baseline model, there are notable improvements in ADE and FDE by 0.03 and 0.06, respectively. It is noteworthy that this method also reduces the inference time by 7% when compared to the currently fastest method. © 2024",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85187207191&doi=10.1016%2fj.neucom.2024.127526&partnerID=40&md5=81ba678d5b7aac7998ea27db813fa76b,Neurocomputing,2024
Nonreciprocal interactions in crowd dynamics: Investigating the impact of moving threats on pedestrian speed preferences,"Nonreciprocal interaction crowd systems, such as human–human, human–vehicle, and human–robot systems, often have serious impacts on pedestrian safety and social order. A more comprehensive understanding of these systems is needed to optimize system stability and efficiency. Despite the importance of these interactions, empirical research in this area remains limited. Thus, in our study we explore this underresearched area, focusing on scenarios where nonreciprocity plays a critical role, such as mass stabbings, which pose a substantial risk to public safety. We conducted the first experiments on this system and analysed high-accuracy data obtained from these experiments. Specifically, we conduct laboratory experiments on three scenarios: single exits, dual exits, and obscured chases. Then, we introduce an equation to describe the mechanism behind a direct threat zone, which significantly affects pedestrian behaviour. The extent of the direct threat zone is determined by the speed of the moving threat and the radius of danger occurrence. The equation can provide insights for different nonreciprocal interaction crowd systems, where the subjects of the nonreciprocal interactions can be a pedestrian, an autonomous robot or a vehicle. We further categorize potential threats into direct, adjacent, and rear-view zones, quantifying the level of threat for pedestrians. Our study revealed that a pedestrian's desired velocity correlated positively with potential threat intensity, increasing until near the direct threat zone. An emerging steady state is observed when escape routes are blocked by moving threats. This deviation affects the density–velocity relationship, making it distinct from the general relationship. This deviation signifies unique pedestrian behaviour in the presence of moving threats. Additionally, the rate of change in the angle for pedestrian motion in various desired directions is synchronized. This indicates the emergence of collective intelligence in nonreciprocal interaction crowd systems. As a result, our study may constitute a pioneering step towards understanding nonreciprocal interactions in crowd systems through laboratory experiments. These findings may enhance pedestrian safety and inform not only government crowd management strategies but also individual self-protection measures. © 2024 Elsevier Ltd",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85189432763&doi=10.1016%2fj.trc.2024.104586&partnerID=40&md5=2d41367cfbcf02d8bf41fe4c3ba25564,Transportation Research Part C: Emerging Technologies,2024
Performance Degradation Estimation Mechanisms for Networked Control Systems Under DoS Attacks and its Application to Autonomous Ground Vehicle,"This article examines the mechanisms by which aperiodic denial-of-service (DoS) attacks can exploit vulnerabilities in the TCP/IP transport protocol and its three-way handshake during communication data transmission to hack and cause data loss in networked control systems (NCSs). Such data loss caused by DoS attacks can eventually lead to system performance degradation and impose network resource constraints on the system. Therefore, estimating system performance degradation is of practical importance. By formulating the problem as an ellipsoid-constrained performance error estimation (PEE) problem, we can estimate the system performance degradation caused by DoS attacks. We propose a new Lyapunov-Krasovskii function (LKF) using the fractional weight segmentation method (FWSM) to examine the sampling interval and introduce a relaxed, positive definite constraint to optimize the control algorithm. We also propose a relaxed, positive definite constraint that reduces the initial constraints to optimize the control algorithm. Next, we introduce an alternate direction algorithm (ADA) to solve the optimal trigger threshold and design an integral-based event-triggered controller (IETC) to estimate the error performance of NCSs with limited network resources. Finally, we verify the effectiveness and feasibility of the proposed method using the Simulink joint platform autonomous ground vehicle (AGV) model.  © 2013 IEEE.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85164424292&doi=10.1109%2fTCYB.2023.3286878&partnerID=40&md5=d8b732c8e72c740b93c8cb3851b4bcf6,IEEE Transactions on Cybernetics,2024
Metacognitive Decision-Making Framework for Multi-UAV Target Search Without Communication,"This article presents a metacognitive decision-making (MDM) framework inspired by human-like metacognitive principles. The MDM framework is incorporated in unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) deployed for decentralized stochastic search without communication for detecting and confirming stationary targets (fixed/sudden pop-up) and dynamic targets. The UAVs are equipped with multiple sensors (varying sensing capability) and search for targets in a largely unknown area. The MDM framework consists of a metacognitive component and a self-cognitive component. The metacognitive component helps to self-regulate the search with multiple sensors addressing the issues of 'which-sensor-to-use,' 'when-to-switch-sensor,' and 'how-to-search.' Based on the information gathered by sensors carried by each UAV, the self-cognitive component regulates different levels of stochastic search and switching levels for effective searching, where the lower levels of search aim to localize a target (detection) and the highest level of a search exploit a target (confirmation). The performance of the MDM framework with two sensors having a low accuracy for detection and increased accuracy to confirm targets is evaluated through Monte Carlo simulations and compared with six decentralized multi-UAV search algorithms (three self-cognitive searches and three self and social-cognitive-based searches). The results indicate that the MDM framework can efficiently detect and confirm targets in an unknown environment.  © 2013 IEEE.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85187297862&doi=10.1109%2fTSMC.2024.3358060&partnerID=40&md5=d9e2536ae7b4de32ed0ae23b33519734,"IEEE Transactions on Systems, Man, and Cybernetics: Systems",2024
Improving Physical Layer Security for multi-UAV Systems Against Hybrid Wireless Attacks,"Multiple unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) systems are increasingly used in civilian and military applications. However, due to the open and broadcast nature of wireless communications, the control and non-payload communication (CNPC) between UAVs and ground control stations (GCSs) is vulnerable to physical (PHY) and medium access control (MAC) layer wireless attacks, such as eavesdropping, jamming, and spoofing. In this paper, we investigate the secure remote control (RC) issue in multi-UAV systems from a physical layer security (PLS) perspective. We propose a secure RC mechanism based on John Boyd's OODA loop and introduce cooperative jamming (CJ) from UAVs to safeguard control data from GCS. To quantify the uncertainty of wireless attacks from aerial and terrestrial potential attackers, we first introduce the Nakagami-m fading model and a mixed line-of-sight (LoS) / non-line-of-sight (NLoS) probability model to characterize hostile air-to-ground (A2G) channels. We then derive the conditions for successful attacks including passive/active eavesdropping, jamming and spoofing, and formulate the risks of each attack and the overall CJ efficiency based on secrecy outage probability (SOP). To optimize the trade-off between risk costs and CJ power consumption for various situations, we propose three levels of control schemes (centralized, partially centralized, and distributed) applicable at GCS or UAVs, and design three decision-making methods with differing complexities. Through simulations, we evaluate the performance of the proposed mechanism under a general scenario that provides diverse physical conditions, threat levels, and security requirements.  © 1967-2012 IEEE.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85179106714&doi=10.1109%2fTVT.2023.3337154&partnerID=40&md5=e8cc135e661518618e39befe9d923ef6,IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology,2024
RSFVC: Robust Biometric-Based Secure Framework for Vehicular Cloud Networking,"Vehicular cloud networking (VCN) is a new study area that combines vehicular cloud computing (VCC) and information-centric networking. By utilizing VCC technologies, it is effectively use in road security and traffic control. The benefits of VCC in VCN are superior, including faster turnover times, scalability, flexibility, cost savings, greater collaborations, advanced security, the prevention of data loss, data security, minimal maintenance, limitless storage capacity, traffic information aggregation, etc. VCN is an intelligent networking system that manages autonomous traffic, system security, privacy, and vehicle control capabilities. During communication, various adversary types have the potential to compromise the security and privacy of these networks. To preserve their security, privacy, confidentiality, and integrity, such systems require an authentication framework. The paper presents an elliptic curve cryptography (ECC) and biometrics-based secure authenticated framework for VCN. The suggested protocol accomplishes all security, privacy, and other criteria for secure communications against active and passive attackers. It is also demonstrated, both formally and informally, that the proposed framework is secure, correct and efficient. The study further establishes, using the simulation tool AVISPA, that the proposed protocol is secure against man-in-The-middle and replay attacks. Additionally, the study uses BAN logic to demonstrate how the mutual authentication property is proven. In VCN, the proposed protocol efficacy is evaluated and compared to other similar protocols within the study. The results show that the proposed framework is secure and efficient in terms of computation and communication overheads. Consequently, the proposed protocol will be advantageous for VCN.  © 2000-2011 IEEE.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85174828325&doi=10.1109%2fTITS.2023.3322960&partnerID=40&md5=ef203c4e3abe46a2339185a63a6a11ff,IEEE Transactions on Intelligent Transportation Systems,2024
Multi-Objective Optimization for UAV Swarm-Assisted IoT With Virtual Antenna Arrays,"Unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) network is a promising technology for assisting Internet-of-Things (IoT), where a UAV can use its limited service coverage to harvest and disseminate data from IoT devices with low transmission abilities. The existing UAV-assisted data harvesting and dissemination schemes largely require UAVs to frequently fly between the IoTs and access points, resulting in extra energy and time costs. To reduce both energy and time costs, a key way is to enhance the transmission performance of IoT and UAVs. In this work, we introduce collaborative beamforming into IoTs and UAVs simultaneously to achieve energy and time-efficient data harvesting and dissemination from multiple IoT clusters to remote base stations (BSs). Except for reducing these costs, another non-ignorable threat lies in the existence of the potential eavesdroppers, whereas the handling of eavesdroppers often increases the energy and time costs, resulting in a conflict with the minimization of the costs. Moreover, the importance of these goals may vary relatively in different applications. Thus, we formulate a multi-objective optimization problem (MOP) to simultaneously minimize the mission completion time, signal strength towards the eavesdropper, and total energy cost of the UAVs. We prove that the formulated MOP is an NP-hard, mixed-variable optimization, and large-scale optimization problem. Thus, we propose a swarm intelligence-based algorithm to find a set of candidate solutions with different trade-offs which can meet various requirements in a low computational complexity. We also show that swarm intelligence methods need to enhance solution initialization, solution update, and algorithm parameter update phases when dealing with mixed-variable optimization and large-scale problems. Simulation results demonstrate the proposed algorithm outperforms state-of-the-art swarm intelligence algorithms and also show that the proposed method can reduce time and energy costs significantly compared with the benchmark strategies based on multi-hop and long-range flight.  © 2023 IEEE.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85165868952&doi=10.1109%2fTMC.2023.3298888&partnerID=40&md5=b4e0a6ecc7d4935d86253a51e21a3160,IEEE Transactions on Mobile Computing,2024
Timeliness and Secrecy-Aware Uplink Data Aggregation for Large-Scale UAV-IoT Networks,"Due to the inherent characteristics of system extensibility and implementation flexibility, unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV)-assisted data aggregations will play an essential role in Internet of Things (IoT) networks, where both communication security and timeliness are of high priority. In this article, we study uplink data aggregation in cooperative jamming-aided large-scale UAV-IoT networks under the threat of eavesdroppers. By employing stochastic geometry, we derive performance metrics related to the age of information (AoI) and secrecy outage probability (SOP) in a system-level manner, and formulate the combat between legitimate entities (i.e., IoT devices and cooperative jammers) and eavesdroppers as a two-stage Stackelberg game. To solve the formulated game, the backward induction method is utilized to obtain the Stackelberg equilibrium (SE) iteratively. Specifically, we first obtain the minimum detection error probability for the eavesdropper by optimizing its detection threshold using the successive convex approximation (SCA) technique. Subsequently, the minimization of AoI violation probability and SOP for the legitimate entity is achieved using the proposed tighter α branch and bound (T-α BB) method by jointly optimizing the transmit powers of the typical IoT device and cooperative jammers as well as the deployment altitude of the typical UAV. Extensive numerical results demonstrate that the proposed solution converges rapidly, with the timeliness and secrecy metrics decreasing by 25.1%, 33.1%, 35.9%, and 37.6% compared to the benchmark scheme in suburban, urban, dense urban, and high-rise urban environments, respectively.  © 2014 IEEE.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85183619105&doi=10.1109%2fJIOT.2024.3357123&partnerID=40&md5=d97904aa574895b70e9e2c47de0d0812,IEEE Internet of Things Journal,2024
A Blockchain-Based Distributed and Intelligent Clustering-Enabled Authentication Protocol for UAV Swarms,"Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) are operated remotely without the presence of a unified system of identity authentication, and wireless communications in untrusted environments can cause the loss of valuable data carried by UAVs. Traditional UAV authentication mechanisms are centralized approaches, which suffer from a single point of failure problem and may incur high complexity computations. Therefore, it is crucial to establish a distributed authentication mechanism between the ground station controller (GSC) and a UAV. Moreover, in case of UAV swarms, the high mobility of the UAVs affects the stability of UAV communications, which leads to the degradation of the UAV authentication performance. Addressing these challenges, we design a blockchain-based distributed authentication mechanism, known as SwarmAuth, for UAV swarms, where the GSC and UAVs follow a mutual authentication approach using physical unclonable functions (PUFs), and the K-means clustering-based intelligent approach is used to dynamically create location-based clusters. The blockchain helps store UAVs' authentication information in an immutable storage and the associated smart contracts provide a convenient access control model. The security analysis of SwarmAuth is carried out through both formal and informal proofs considering general attacks. Experimental evaluation shows that SwarmAuth can assure trustworthy communications and improve the network performance. © 2023 IEEE.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85173416664&doi=10.1109%2fTMC.2023.3319544&partnerID=40&md5=75c7c7f1d79fa2da3216deb766b53224,IEEE Transactions on Mobile Computing,2024
Privacy-Preserving Data-Enabled Predictive Leading Cruise Control in Mixed Traffic,"Data-driven predictive control of connected and automated vehicles (CAVs) has received increasing attention as it can achieve safe and optimal control without relying on explicit dynamical models. However, employing the data-driven strategy involves the collection and sharing of privacy-sensitive vehicle information, which is vulnerable to privacy leakage and might further lead to malicious activities. In this paper, we develop a privacy-preserving data-enabled predictive control scheme for CAVs in a mixed traffic environment, where human-driven vehicles (HDVs) and CAVs coexist. We tackle external eavesdroppers and honest-but-curious central unit eavesdroppers who wiretap the communication channel of the mixed traffic system and intend to infer the CAVs' state and input information. An affine masking-based privacy protection method is designed to conceal the true state and input signals, and an extended form of the data-enabled predictive leading cruise control under different data matrix structures is derived to achieve privacy-preserving optimal control for CAVs. Numerical simulations demonstrate that the proposed scheme can protect the privacy of CAVs against attackers without affecting control performance or incurring heavy computations. © 2000-2011 IEEE.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85178030566&doi=10.1109%2fTITS.2023.3329484&partnerID=40&md5=f651b88e8a198e7d176b1d5e97dc345c,IEEE Transactions on Intelligent Transportation Systems,2024
Domain Adaptation of Anchor-Free object detection for urban traffic,"Modern detectors are mostly trained under single and limited conditions. However, object detection faces various complex and open situations in autonomous driving, especially in urban street scenes with dense objects and complex backgrounds. Due to the shift in data distribution, modern detectors cannot perform well in actual urban environments. Using domain adaptation to improve detection performance is one of the key methods to extend object detection from limited situations to open situations. To this end, this article proposes a Domain Adaptation of Anchor-Free object detection (DAAF) for urban traffic. DAAF is a cross-domain object detection method that performs feature alignment including two aspects. On the one hand, we designed a fully convolutional adversarial training method for global feature alignment at the image level. Meanwhile, images can generally be decomposed into structural information and texture information. In urban street scenes, the structural information of images is generally similar. The main difference between the source domain and the target domain is texture information. Therefore, during global feature alignment, this paper proposes a method called texture information limitation (TIL). On the other hand, in order to solve the problem of variable aspect ratios of objects in urban street scenes, this article uses an anchor-free detector as the baseline detector. Since the anchor-free object detector can obtain neither explicit nor implicit instance-level features, we adopt Pixel-Level Adaptation (PLA) to align local features instead of instance-level alignment for local features. The size of the object has the greatest impact on the final detection effect, and the object scale in urban scenes is relatively rich. Guided by the differentiation of attention mechanisms, a multi-level adversarial network is designed to perform feature alignment of the output space at different feature levels called Scale Information Limitation (SIL). We conducted cross-domain detection experiments by using various urban streetscape autonomous driving object detection datasets, including adverse weather conditions, synthetic data to real data, and cross-camera adaptation. The experimental results indicate that the method proposed in this article is effective. © 2024 Elsevier B.V.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85187778984&doi=10.1016%2fj.neucom.2024.127477&partnerID=40&md5=07d217af315202b413af44970065171b,Neurocomputing,2024
ODFa2: Overall Defense Framework Against Cyber-Attacks on Intelligent Connected Vehicles,"Autonomous driving, as an emerging technology, is developing rapidly. However, a number of obstacles appear to be holding back the widespread adoption of autonomous driving. Cybersecurity issues, which have a significant impact both technically and psychologically on people's willingness to use autonomous driving, are one of the most significant barriers. Attackers have adopted increasingly diverse threat methods, increasing cyber-attacks. Despite these threats, global standards have been developed for road vehicle safety and cybersecurity. These standards are intended to guide manufacturers of automotive systems. For instance, the ISO and SAE have jointly released the international standard ISO/SAE 21434 (Road Vehicles - Cybersecurity Engineering) for road vehicle cybersecurity. However, focusing on the development of onboard systems alone when examining the application of these standards is not sufficient. Currently, we lack a methodology to directly apply the ISO/SAE 21434 standard to automotive system engineering projects. In particular, the overall framework of cybersecurity design for intelligent connected vehicle systems needs to be developed. This paper proposes an overall cybersecurity assurance framework (ODFa{}^{2}) based on the ISO/SAE 21434 standard to assist system engineers in understanding security risks, evaluating the feasibility of attack implementation, and determining the trade-off methods for security countermeasures. We illustrate through a case study how this model-based framework may be applied to cybersecurity engineering in intelligent connected vehicles and mobility service platforms. Furthermore, the results of comparative experiments indicate that the proposed strategy optimization algorithm outperforms existing algorithms in terms of time efficiency under certain conditions.  © 1967-2012 IEEE.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85182373555&doi=10.1109%2fTVT.2023.3345156&partnerID=40&md5=4245aacde48cdd0b6ec8b5b8fc504592,IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology,2024
Neural-Network-Based Adaptive Fault-Tolerant Cooperative Control of Heterogeneous Multiagent Systems With Multiple Faults and DoS Attacks,"In this article, the issue of adaptive fault-tolerant cooperative control is addressed for heterogeneous multiple unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) and unmanned ground vehicles (UGVs) with actuator faults and sensor faults under denial-of-service (DoS) attacks. First, a unified control model with actuator faults and sensor faults is developed based on the dynamic models of the UAVs and UGVs. To handle the difficulty introduced by the nonlinear term, a neural-network-based switching-type observer is established to obtain the unmeasured state variables when DoS attacks are active. Then, the fault-tolerant cooperative control scheme is presented by utilizing an adaptive backstepping control algorithm under DoS attacks. According to Lyapunov stability theory and improved average dwell time method by integrating the duration and frequency characteristics of DoS attacks, the stability of the closed-loop system is proved. In addition, all vehicles can track their individual references, while the synchronized tracking errors among vehicles are uniformly ultimately bounded. Finally, simulation studies are given to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.  © 2012 IEEE.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85162618973&doi=10.1109%2fTNNLS.2023.3282234&partnerID=40&md5=e0b39fb2ee5d1d77e6aff672e672226e,IEEE Transactions on Neural Networks and Learning Systems,2024
K-L Divergence-Based Detection of Attacks on Remote Control: The Utilization of Local Information,"This article explores the security control in a remote control system driven by local and remote controllers. By utilizing the information of the local controller (namely, local information, including its mean and error variance), we propose a new actuator-side detector that can prevent performance degradation caused by attacks on the remote control signal, which is transmitted to the actuator through wireless communication. Besides, it can also overcome the difficulties when a standard Kullback-Leibler divergence detector fails to detect such attacks before the control signal is input into the system due to the unavailability of innovation z_k or measurement y_k. Subsequently, we characterize the corresponding impacts of different attack patterns on the estimation performance under the proposed detector. Based on this, we offer a compensation mechanism to improve the performance of the remote estimator under the attack. Finally, simulations are provided to illustrate the developed results.  © 2005-2012 IEEE.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85190166179&doi=10.1109%2fTII.2024.3379672&partnerID=40&md5=a5857baf200e7cdfb232e3dea1671e7a,IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics,2024
Collect Spatiotemporally Correlated Data in IoT Networks with an Energy-Constrained UAV,"Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) are promising tools for efficient data collections of sensors in Internet of Things networks. Existing studies exploited both spatial and temporal data correlations to reduce the amount of collected redundant data, in which sensors are first partitioned into different clusters, a master sensor in each cluster then collects raw data from other sensors and compresses the received data. An energy-constrained UAV finally collects the maximum amount of compressed data from different master sensors. We however notice that the compressed data from only a portion of clusters are collected by the UAV in the existing studies, while the data from other clusters are not collected at all. In this article, we study a problem of finding a data collection trajectory for an energy-constrained UAV, so that the accumulative utility of collected data is maximized, where the accumulative utility measures the quality of spatiotemporally correlated data collected from different clusters. We propose a novel [1/(6+ϵ )] -approximation algorithm for the problem, where ϵ is a given constant with ϵ > 0. Experimental results with real data sets show that the accumulative utility by the proposed algorithm is at least 23% larger than those by the existing studies, and the number of clusters collected by the proposed algorithm is from 45% to 105% larger than those by the existing studies.  © 2014 IEEE.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85188905716&doi=10.1109%2fJIOT.2024.3370295&partnerID=40&md5=35f693b4c5c8b236acbc683cbab727a0,IEEE Internet of Things Journal,2024
MTL-PIE: A multi-task learning based drone pilot identification and operation evaluation scheme,"As one of the most promising industries, consumer-grade Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs), also known as drones, have changed our lives. Although significant progress in drones has been made, adversary impersonation attacks still pose severe risks to flying drones. In addition, authorized pilot miss-operations also has become a critical factor leading to drone flight accidents. To validate the pilot's legal status and remind the authorized pilot about their miss-operations, we propose a multi-task learning-based drone pilot identification and operation evaluation scheme named MTL-PIE. Specifically, we first present qualitative and quantitative guidelines to evaluate pilot operation proficiency. Then, we design a pilot identification module and an operation evaluation module to resist pilot impersonation attacks and assess pilot operation proficiency, respectively. Finally, we propose a soft-parameter sharing mechanism to transfer knowledge between two modules and a dynamic weight-adjusting algorithm to prevent domain-dominant problems. Numerical results show that MTL-PIE can verify pilot legal status with an accuracy of 95.36% (outperforming our previous work with a margin of 2%-3%) and act as assessors to evaluate pilot operation proficiency with an accuracy of 94.47%. Note that MTL-PIE needs only 35 ms to verify pilot legal status and assess pilot operation proficiency; it has great potential to reduce drone flight accidents. © 2024 Elsevier Inc.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85188528301&doi=10.1016%2fj.vehcom.2024.100760&partnerID=40&md5=984d00f390ec5c9e0e3f298ae528b32e,Vehicular Communications,2024
Hunter: Tracing anycast communications to uncover cross-border personal data transfers,"Cross-border personal data transfers are heavily regulated worldwide, with data protection authorities imposing huge fines on organizations that fail to meet their strict compliance requirements. However, network-level optimizations such as anycast addresses were not designed with personal data in mind, and their use may unwittingly divert personal data out of a legal boundary. This paper describes Hunter, an automated method to trace anycast communications and identify those threatening data protection compliance. We have applied Hunter in the wild to a set of Android apps to discover that all apps observed sending personal data to anycast addresses eventually carry out international transfers but fail to disclose them in their privacy policies. Our findings suggest that using anycast addresses to transmit personal data generally results in data protection compliance issues. © 2024 The Author(s)",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85189536142&doi=10.1016%2fj.cose.2024.103823&partnerID=40&md5=9c8e2150643d2b49859aff5853eadcf4,Computers and Security,2024
Lane Segmentation Data Augmentation for Heavy Rain Sensor Blockage Using Realistically Translated Raindrop Images and CARLA Simulator,"Lane segmentation and Lane Keeping Assist System (LKAS) play a vital role in autonomous driving. While deep learning technology has significantly improved the accuracy of lane segmentation, real-world driving scenarios present various challenges. In particular, heavy rainfall not only obscures the road with sheets of rain and fog but also creates water droplets on the windshield or lens of the camera that affects the lane segmentation performance. There may even be a false positive problem in which the algorithm incorrectly recognizes a raindrop as a road lane. Collecting heavy rain data is challenging in real-world settings, and manual annotation of such data is expensive. In this research, we propose a realistic raindrop conversion process that employs a contrastive learning-based Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) model to transform raindrops randomly generated using Python libraries. In addition, we utilize the attention mask of the lane segmentation model to guide the placement of raindrops in training images from the translation target domain (real Rainy-Images). By training the ENet-SAD model using the realistically Translated-Raindrop images and lane ground truth automatically extracted from the CARLA Simulator, we observe an improvement in lane segmentation accuracy in Rainy-Images. This method enables training and testing of the perception model while adjusting the number, size, shape, and direction of raindrops, thereby contributing to future research on autonomous driving in adverse weather conditions.  © 2016 IEEE.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85190731284&doi=10.1109%2fLRA.2024.3390587&partnerID=40&md5=1a695977604ce825e74da46cab6a603f,IEEE Robotics and Automation Letters,2024
A Regret-Informed Evolutionary Approach for Generating Adversarial Scenarios for Black-Box Off-Road Autonomy Systems,"Developing autonomous vehicles (AVs) that operate in diverse and demanding environments is a difficult challenge. Two fundamental tools that can accelerate this process are testing an AV in diverse simulated environments and identifying core system weaknesses. While most efforts focus on improving these tools for on-road AVs, this letter focuses on an analogous set of tools for off-road AVs. A method called Black-Box Adversarially Compounding Regret Through Evolution (BACRE) is proposed for identifying adversarial scenarios using an evolutionary algorithm guided by a novel regret-based metric for general navigation tasks. A black-box approach is often preferable when system complexity can be diverse, like with off-road AVs, and when whole-system testing is required. A custom simulation platform is also provided to assist with the automated testing of AVs in diverse, unstructured environments. Numerical experiments demonstrate that BACRE's evolutionary process gradually increases scenario complexity to degrade vehicle performance (an effective and explainable process that comparable methods cannot achieve). Consequently, BACRE can streamline AV development by finding weaknesses at any development stage. © 2016 IEEE.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85190169452&doi=10.1109%2fLRA.2024.3387109&partnerID=40&md5=eb93ebe243da50e6455038a43c4e99b6,IEEE Robotics and Automation Letters,2024
Authentication and Key Agreement Based on Three Factors and PUF for UAV-Assisted Post-Disaster Emergency Communication,"For unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs)-assisted post-disaster emergency communication networks, UAVs serve as relay nodes of air-based backup network to support transmission of rescue messages to emergency communication vehicles (ECVs), while ECVs provide on-site ground communication and connectivity to the command center (CC) of the rescue operation. Existing works seldom emphasize communication security, such as authenticity of communicating parties and integrity of message content. In this connection, authentication and key agreement (AKA) protocols are promising solutions for achieving communication security. However, the traditional approaches to endpoint security and entity authentication of principals may not be practical in emergency situations, in which network equipment and security modules are exposed to an open and untrusted physical environment. Besides, there is a lack of attention to the study of privacy impacts resulted from the physical loss of UAVs. More importantly, cyber attacks and excessive overhead may deteriorate AKA availability. Motivated by the above challenges, we propose an AKA protocol, namely, AKAEC, which is based on three-factor (i.e., smart card, biometrics, and password) and physically unclonable function (PUF) for protecting UAVs-assisted emergency communication. Specifically, AKAEC includes ECV-to-UAV (E2U) and UAV-to-UAV (U2U), where the former achieves secure emergency communication between ECV and UAV, while the latter realizes secure emergency communication between UAV and UAV. We then provide a formal security proof under the real-or-random (ROR) model and formal security verification by automated validation of Internet security protocol and application. This is followed by a security analysis to show that AKAEC meets the security goals defined for emergency situations. Finally, the performance of AKAEC is evaluated from communication overhead and computational overhead.  © 2014 IEEE.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85194403574&doi=10.1109%2fJIOT.2024.3371101&partnerID=40&md5=d70e80dd1704ea7e9c5db025091efb15,IEEE Internet of Things Journal,2024
IoV-6G+: A secure blockchain-based data collection and sharing framework for Internet of vehicles in 6G-assisted environment,"The growing need for wide and ubiquitous accessibility to advanced Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS) has led to the evolution of conventional Vehicle to Everything (V2X) paradigms into the Internet of Vehicles (IoVs). Next-generation IoVs establish seamless connections among humans, vehicles, Internet of Things (IoT) devices, and service platforms to enhance transit efficiency, road safety, and environmental conservation, with notable advancements in IoV technologies, specifically in secure data exchange and user privacy protection. Additionally, Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) are envisioned as scalable and adaptable solutions for comprehensive IoV service coverage. The current approaches in IoV mainly concentrate on local infrastructure setups, overlooking the potential of infrastructure-less IoVs that lack extensive edge facilities. Also, the transmission of data over public channels by vehicles equipped with servers is susceptible to interception and tampering by malicious attackers. Moreover, the substantial amount of real-time data generated by vehicles, IoT devices, travelers, and social interactions pose a significant strain on servers as well as latency issues. To address these security concerns, this research suggests a secure-lightweight data collection and sharing framework for 6G-assisted smart transportation using blockchain and UAV, called IoV-6G+. The process entails drones collecting information and transmitting it to dedicated edge servers that securely aggregate the information and generate transactions on a cloud server. A cloud server securely collects data from edge servers, creates transactions, combines them into blocks, and then confirms and adds these blocks to the blockchain through a voting-based consensus method in a peer-to-peer network of cloud servers. Additionally, the security analysis of our proposed IoV-6G+ is assessed using the “Informal and formal (i.e., Scyther Tool, and Real-or-Random (RoR) Model) methods”, showcasing its efficacy in delivering a secure and efficient authentication mechanism for IoV. Moreover, the proposed IoV-6G+ exhibits lower computational and communication costs as well as energy consumption, along with enhanced security features, when compared to existing authentication frameworks. © 2024 Elsevier Inc.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85191792673&doi=10.1016%2fj.vehcom.2024.100783&partnerID=40&md5=c393ec89a16f1b25dff528338bc52fe6,Vehicular Communications,2024
Enhancing vehicular platoon stability in the presence of communication Cyberattacks: A reliable longitudinal cooperative control strategy,"This study proposes a reliable longitudinal distributed control strategy for connected and automated vehicles (CAVs) in the presence of communication cyberattacks. The proposed strategy is designed to utilize dependable measurements from onboard sensors to evaluate the reliability of vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) information and enhance the platoon string stability in an integrated manner. Specifically, this paper proposes a real-time reliability evaluation mechanism for the ego vehicle based on sensing and communication information from multiple predecessors, employing an upper-tailed chi-squared test. The mechanism is then incorporated into a distributed multi-predecessor linear feedback controller to adaptively weigh the preceding vehicles’ information, ensuring robustness against cyberattacks and maintaining the string stability of the vehicular platoon. To better understand the whole framework, sufficient conditions of true string stability and pseudo string stability are theoretically derived, unveiling the disturbance amplification jointly impacted by measurement accuracy of onboard sensors, cyberattack severity in V2V communication, and control parameters. Numerical experiments are conducted to validate the controller across various types of communication cyberattacks.

Fuzzy Adaptive Event-Triggered Resilient Formation Control for Nonlinear Multiagent Systems Under DoS Attacks and Input Saturation,"This article studies the fuzzy adaptive event-triggered resilient formation (RF) control problem for nonlinear multiagent systems (MASs) subject to denial-of-service (DoS) attacks and input saturation. Fuzzy logic systems (FLSs) are adopted to identify unknown subsystems, and a fuzzy state estimator is established to address the issue resulted from unmeasurable states. A distributed RF filter is proposed to estimate the unknown leader and obtain the n -order derivative of the estimated leader under DoS attacks. To save limited communication resource and reduce the number of controller updates, a switching event-triggered mechanism (SETM) is introduced. Then, a fuzzy event-triggered RF control algorithm is designed via backstepping control method. It is demonstrated that the controlled MASs are stable and formation errors converge even subject to DoS attacks and input saturation.

Trustworthy autonomous driving via defense-aware robust reinforcement learning against worst-case observational perturbations,"Despite the substantial advancements in reinforcement learning (RL) in recent years, ensuring trustworthiness remains a formidable challenge when applying this technology to safety-critical autonomous driving domains. One pivotal bottleneck is that well-trained driving policy models may be particularly vulnerable to observational perturbations or perceptual uncertainties, potentially leading to severe failures. In view of this, we present a novel defense-aware robust RL approach tailored for ensuring the robustness and safety of autonomous vehicles in the face of worst-case attacks on observations. The proposed paradigm primarily comprises two crucial modules: an adversarial attacker and a robust defender. Specifically, the adversarial attacker is devised to approximate the worst-case observational perturbations that attempt to induce safety violations (e.g., collisions) in the RL-driven autonomous vehicle. Additionally, the robust defender is developed to facilitate the safe RL agent to learn robust optimal policies that maximize the return while constraining the policy and cost perturbed by the adversarial attacker within specified bounds. Finally, the proposed technique is assessed across three distinct traffic scenarios: highway, on-ramp, and intersection. The simulation and experimental results indicate that our scheme enables the agent to execute trustworthy driving policies, even in the presence of the worst-case observational perturbations. © 2024 Elsevier Ltd",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85191985184&doi=10.1016%2fj.trc.2024.104632&partnerID=40&md5=408b743c24a8ea705b76e60d1ab8e06c,Transportation Research Part C: Emerging Technologies,2024
Optimal design of adaptive model predictive control based on improved GWO for autonomous vehicle considering system vision uncertainty,"The tuning issue of the parameters and the system uncertainty represent big challenges in most engineering applications. In this regard, a new tuning approach is developed for adaptive model predictive control (AMPC) of autonomous vehicles (AVs). The proposed control strategy tackles the uncertainty issue of the vision system due to the variation of the velocity, road curvature, time delay, and look ahead distance. The proposed AMPC is designed depending on a new improved grey wolf optimizer (IGWO) algorithm with different learning procedures and fitness-distance balance (FDB) approach to equilibrium the exploration and exploitation manners of the original GWO. This development of GWO based on FDB can increase the capability of the GWO for global search and avoid trapping in local states. Furthermore, the proposed IGWO does not require more adjustable parameters that can enhance the convergence to the best global solution rapidly. The new IGWO is compared with recent optimization algorithms such as the mayfly optimization algorithm (MA), chimp optimization algorithm (COA), dynamic arithmetic optimization algorithm (DAOA), whale optimization algorithm (WOA), jaya algorithm (JA), archimedes optimization algorithm (AOA), and equilibrium optimizer (EO) as well as the original GWO. Besides, the performance of the designed AMPC is compared with the fuzzy logic proportional integral (FLPI) controller and the traditional MPC. Various test scenarios are performed to assert the robustness and effectiveness of the designed AMPC against the variation of the velocity, road curvature, time delay, and look ahead distance. The results emphasize that the proposed AMPC can perform the best damping response with an overshoot of around 1.3 m and a settling time of around 1.12 s less than the FLPI controller and the traditional MPC. © 2024 Elsevier B.V.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85190300532&doi=10.1016%2fj.asoc.2024.111581&partnerID=40&md5=67a6554bfe2a5f9ab2df56cf942f2862,Applied Soft Computing,2024

EML-PSP: A novel ensemble machine learning-based physical security paradigm using cross-domain ultra-fused feature extraction with hybrid data augmentation scheme,"Seismic signals classification has many real-time applications related to monitoring and collecting information for investigations, public safety, and prevention of security breaches. We cross-amalgamated the seismic signals with acoustic data augmentation/feature extraction techniques, keeping the beneficial effects of each domain. In this context, we have identified the human walk from that of an animal by manipulating the seismic response. This work presents a robust automated system for surveillance against noisy environments for the classification of seismic events, which is trained to exploit the collected geo signals, namely the physical security dataset (PSD). In this context, an ensemble machine learning-based integrated physical security paradigm (EML-PSP) framework is proposed for automatically classifying humans and animals on seismic signals through a cross-domain ultra-fused feature extraction (UFFE) module using numerous speech-related feature extraction approaches. For the model to learn considerably, we have introduced a hybrid augmentation module (HAM) to synthesize realistic seismic signals based on multiple acoustic augmentation schemes. The ensemble features with enhanced discrimination power have been used to train ensemble algorithms like light-gradient boosted machine (LGBM), random forest-, and adaptive boosting-models. The exhaustive comparison of the proposed solution has been carried out with other state-of-the-art methods. On exploiting the UFFE-based features, the performance of the LGBM ensemble outnumbered other classifiers with an F1-Score of 0.9961 ± 0.0031. The Matthews correlation coefficient and accuracy were 0.9841 ± 0.0127 and 99.4111 ± 0.0047 percent, respectively. The geo sensor's PSD results illustrated that the EML-PSP framework has adequate physical security and surveillance prospects. © 2023 Elsevier Ltd",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85179851271&doi=10.1016%2fj.eswa.2023.122863&partnerID=40&md5=facbb4dc5def09c8e3db855889a5ed6e,Expert Systems with Applications,2024
Intrusion Detection for Unmanned Aerial Vehicles Security: A Tiny Machine Learning Model,"Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) are vulnerable to network attacks. Designing an effective intrusion detection system (IDS) for UAVs is crucial. However, UAVs have limited computing resources and need to deal with massive amounts of network data, which further increases the difficulty of detection. Moreover, most existing IDSs have large parameters. In this study, we develop a tiny machine learning-based IDS to solve the above issue. We first establish an improved fuzzy rough set (FRS) model based on adaptive neighborhoods. Then, using the proposed FRS model, we employ a feature selection (FS) method to select optimal features and reduce the overall computational cost of the IDS. Furthermore, we proposed a tiny intrusion detection model that attains high-precision detection via shallow deep learning. Additionally, the proposed method can address intrusion detection problems in scenarios with partial data missing. According to the evaluations, the proposed method can effectively address intrusion detection in UAVs.  © 2014 IEEE.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85184320708&doi=10.1109%2fJIOT.2024.3360231&partnerID=40&md5=63511fdaa3f3caa0f88265d74f130e05,IEEE Internet of Things Journal,2024
Joint UAV Deployment and User Scheduling for Wireless Powered Wearable Networks,"The integration of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) and wireless power transfer (WPT) is promising to provide charging and communication services to on-ground devices. However, traditional studies focus on UAVs at a fixed height to provide services for devices, ignoring their flexibility. To fully exploit the potential of UAVs in wearable networks, we take the height of UAVs into consideration to maximize the network throughput and minimize the task completion time. Considering the UAV coverage and energy constraints, we formulate the service time allocation and UAV height control optimization problem as a constrained Markov decision process (CMDP). Then, we propose a Lagrangian-based proximal policy optimization (PPO)-CMDP algorithm to optimize the primal pair-based policy. Finally, simulation evaluation shows that our proposed algorithm has significant advantages in terms of network throughput and service fairness.  © 2014 IEEE.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85184308679&doi=10.1109%2fJIOT.2024.3360078&partnerID=40&md5=8175b8b8191873caa80664431477ea6b,IEEE Internet of Things Journal,2024
Robust Secure Precoding for UAV-Aided Multi-Beam Satellite NOMA Communications,"The wide coverage and broadcasting characteristics of satellite communications lead to multi-beam downlinks being vulnerable to security threats, such as eavesdropping, hacking and illegal access. This article takes into account the case of multiple users and an eavesdropper (Eve) in the target beam. In particular, we consider the deployment of an unmanned aerial vehicle to generate artificial noise in order to confuse Eve, while acting as a relay for the legitimate users. In addition, a non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) strategy is used to support multi-user communication and to improve the transmission rate. Considering the constraints due to quality of service, total and per-beam transmit power of the satellite, two robust secure precoding algorithms are presented to maximize the minimal achievable secrecy rate of the legitimate users for both non-critical and critical applications. Since the formulated optimization problems are non-convex, we first use the arithmetic-geometric mean inequality to solve the non-convex constraint of the successive interference cancellation decoding order, and the logarithmic parameter form is addressed by using the first-order Taylor series expansion. Besides, the secure outage probability constraint of the critical case is effectively resolved by applying the Bernstein-type inequality/decomposition-based large deviation inequality. Moreover, semi-definite relaxation and penalty function optimization methods are adopted to design the transmit power of the satellite in two cases, respectively. Simulation results verify the effectiveness and superiority of the proposed robust precoding design methods. © 1967-2012 IEEE.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85182924140&doi=10.1109%2fTVT.2024.3349686&partnerID=40&md5=f76f7055d0409c82fa6bd6b8d0b45b76,IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology,2024
Path Planning of Autonomous Mobile Robot in Comprehensive Unknown Environment Using Deep Reinforcement Learning,"In real-world situations, some unavoidable problems like significant dependence on environment information, long inference time and weak anti-disturbance ability are often involved in path planning of autonomous mobile robot (AMR) under unknown environments. To solve these issues, this article proposes an improved deep reinforcement learning-based path-planning algorithm to find out an optimized path for a class of AMRs. First, the path planning of AMR is described as a Markov decision process framework, and the double deep Q network (DDQN) is utilized to obtain the optimal adaptive solutions of AMR's path planning. Second, a comprehensive reward function integrated with heuristic function is designed to navigate the AMR into the target area. Afterwards, an optimized deep neural network with an adaptive ϵ-greedy action selection policy is designed to deal with the tradeoff between exploration and exploitation, thus further to improve the global searching capability and the convergence performance for the AMR path planning. Moreover, Bezier curve theory is utilized to smooth the planned path. Finally, the comparative simulations are carried out to validate our proposed path-planning algorithm. The results show that, compared with DQN, A*, RRT, and APF algorithms, our improved DDQN algorithm can produce safer and shorter global paths in comprehensive unknown environments. Meanwhile, the IDDQN algorithm has strong adaptability to random disturbances in unknown environments.  © 2014 IEEE.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85188437630&doi=10.1109%2fJIOT.2024.3379361&partnerID=40&md5=229b4eb159b0b83c6276b953f6c6fd20,IEEE Internet of Things Journal,2024
Event-Based Intermittent Formation Control of Multi-UAV Systems Under Deception Attacks,"This article investigates the problem of event-based intermittent formation control for multi-UAV systems subject to deception attacks. Compared to the available research studies on multi-UAV systems with continuous control strategy, the proposed intermittent control strategy saves a large amount of computation resources. An average method is introduced in developing the event-triggered mechanism (ETM) such that the amount of unexpected triggering events induced by uncertain disturbances is greatly reduced. Moreover, such a mechanism can further decrease the average data-releasing rate, thereby alleviating the burden of network bandwidth. Sufficient conditions for multi-UAV systems with deception attacks to achieve the predefined formation are obtained with the aid of Lyapunov stability theory. Finally, the validity of the proposed theoretical results is demonstrated via a simulation example.  © 2012 IEEE.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85144812179&doi=10.1109%2fTNNLS.2022.3227101&partnerID=40&md5=d1cb394b4777c2172de8e870c4c3fa31,IEEE Transactions on Neural Networks and Learning Systems,2024
Secure Sampled-Data Consensus of Multi-Agent Systems under Asynchronous Deception Attacks with Application to Unmanned Surface Vehicles,"This paper studies the secure sampled-data consensus of multi-agent systems (MASs) under asynchronous independent deception attacks and multiplicative control gain disturbances by developing the looped Lyapunov-Krasovskii functional (LKF) approach. Because of the openness and shareability of communication network, as well as the time delay in the process of data transmission, two independent deception attacks with asynchronous phenomenon are considered in the sensor-to-controller (SC) and controller-to-actuator (CA) channel of MAS communication network. Furthermore, a coupled memory-based sampled-data control scheme is proposed and fractional-delay states on sampling intervals are introduced to construct an improved delay-dependent looped LKF. Therefore, a relaxed condition with lower conservatism is established to asymptotically ensure the secure sampled-data consensus of MASs in mean square under our designed control protocol. Finally, a simulation test applied to unmanned surface vehicles is conducted to validated the performance of designed control strategy.  © 2000-2011 IEEE.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85177996691&doi=10.1109%2fTITS.2023.3330995&partnerID=40&md5=dc3ddb000b0465ebcbbc92303e76c027,IEEE Transactions on Intelligent Transportation Systems,2024
A Lightweight and Anonymous Application-Aware Authentication and Key Agreement Protocol for the Internet of Drones,"The drone technology has continuously been evolving since the beginning of the first decade of the 21st century with exceptional growth over the last several years. To pave the way for an interoperable aerial-ground communication platform, the Internet of Drones (IoD) framework has emerged to systematically organize a batch of drones to collect multiple application-specific data simultaneously and report them to a close ground station. As the collected data might contain sensitive information, people become more critically aware of data security and privacy issues associated with IoD applications. Authentication and key agreement protocols are able to protect IoD data from unauthorized access. However, the recent schemes fail to distinguish between types of data during the authentication and key establishment process, which leads to data leakage that sensitive data are being accessed by unauthorized entities. To address the data leakage issue and fill the research gap, this article proposes a lightweight and anonymous application-Aware authentication and key agreement protocol (also called liteA4) for IoD systems. The fundamental idea of liteA4 is that the ground station and the drone perform data type-Aware mutual authentication and establish separate session keys for different types of data before the drone delivers the collected data to the ground station. The major techniques, such as hash function, bitwise xor, and physical unclonable function (PUF), are used to implement liteA4. We select the Automated Validation of Internet Security Protocols and Applications (AVISPAs) tool to verify the security of liteA4 in the cyber-Threat environment. We also set up a simulation framework and conduct comprehensive and comparative experiments to validate the performance of liteA4. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that liteA4 not only is a safe and reliable protocol in the adversarial setting but also provides better results than its counterpart approaches in terms of communication overhead, computational time, storage cost, as well as energy consumption. © 2014 IEEE.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85186072848&doi=10.1109%2fJIOT.2024.3367799&partnerID=40&md5=8b4b49af2f53924047ee750972779f23,IEEE Internet of Things Journal,2024
Model Predictive Formation Tracking-Containment Control for Multi-UAVs With Obstacle Avoidance,"This article investigates the formation tracking-containment control problem for multiple unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), while considering collision avoidance in the three-dimensional (3-D) environment. A distributed model predictive formation control method is developed for UAVs with obstacle avoidance. Unlike most existing trajectory tracking control schemes, the proposed method is derived from a smooth shifting function and a distributed Lyapunov-based model predictive controller, together with two collision-free functions, to obtain an improved control algorithm with the following characteristics: 1) the swarm system of UAVs realizes the cooperative hunting process from tracking formation to containing formation, fencing a target to their convex hull; 2) the Lyapunov-based model predictive formation control method inherits the stability properties of backstepping technique and adopts the receding horizon optimization of model predictive control (MPC) technique; and 3) by exploiting the Lyapunov-based MPC algorithm and collision-free functions, the swarm system of UAVs can avoid collision with obstacles or collision with each other in 3-D scenarios with multiple obstacles. Finally, the simulation and comparison results confirm that the proposed controller outperforms the traditional backstepping controller in terms of safety and tracking performance.  © 2013 IEEE.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85187251265&doi=10.1109%2fTSMC.2024.3354893&partnerID=40&md5=db9313b2555da02922e5bba1ab3bc9e2,"IEEE Transactions on Systems, Man, and Cybernetics: Systems",2024
Distributional Soft Actor-Critic-Based Multi-AUV Cooperative Pursuit for Maritime Security Protection,"Unauthorized underwater vehicles (UUVs) pose a serious threat to maritime security. To preserve maritime security, it is essential to pursue these UUVs. The majority of traditional pursuit methods are based on known environmental dynamics. However, the underwater environment is too complicated and unpredictable to describe these dynamics accurately. This study developed a novel online decision-making technique called multi-agent distributional soft actor-critic (MADA) to handle the issue of underwater cooperative pursuit. The method constructs a control-oriented framework based on multi-agent reinforcement learning that can map autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV) observations to pursuit actions. Multiple AUVs can combine to make prompt pursuit decisions. Then, the proposed method combines distributional soft actor-critic and curriculum learning to improve the success rates of multiple AUVs in pursuing UUVs. Experimental results show that the MADA can obtain a better cooperative pursuit strategy.  © 2000-2011 IEEE.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85181570451&doi=10.1109%2fTITS.2023.3341034&partnerID=40&md5=dd4ef000da4ec7b2673f0030017b2c90,IEEE Transactions on Intelligent Transportation Systems,2024
Transferability of Adversarial Attacks on Tiny Deep Learning Models for IoT Unmanned Aerial Vehicles,"In the realm of miniature machine learning for Internet of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), the security concerns of machine-learning models are obvious, especially when it comes to adversarial attacks. Models can become confused and their performance is undermined by the introduction of meticulously crafted distortions. These attacks can even infiltrate a variety of models, bringing greater security risks. To understand how it works and mitigate its effects, our research focuses on scrutinizing the transferability of adversarial attacks in the expanding context of miniature machine learning for UAVs. In this article, we introduce a formula to help measure the transferability of adversarial attacks and explore ways to improve the transferability and effectiveness of adversarial attacks (e.g., a combination of attack techniques), and provide visualizations to vividly illustrate the repercussions of adversarial instances across a spectrum of attack intensities, helping facilitate more intuitive exploration and analysis of the results. For instance, our findings demonstrate that even subtle perturbations directed at specific attributes can lead to a significant decrease in model accuracy. We also evaluate the success rates of various attack algorithms and validate the proposed evaluation methodology for measuring transferability. And the outcomes unveiled in this study make noteworthy strides in fostering a profound comprehension of the transferability of adversarial attacks in the distinct realm of miniature machine learning for UAVs. Robust defense mechanisms, which ensure the impregnability of IoT-enabled UAV systems, can be cultivated by pinpointing the most efficacious attack strategies and evaluating their transferability.  © 2014 IEEE.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85177025116&doi=10.1109%2fJIOT.2023.3329954&partnerID=40&md5=142d553980c14d55f7467eb888b36b54,IEEE Internet of Things Journal,2024
Exploiting Label Uncertainty for Enhanced 3D Object Detection from Point Clouds,"Accurate detection of objects from LiDAR point clouds is crucial for autonomous driving and environment modeling. However, uncertainties in ground truth labels due to occlusions, sparsity, and truncation can hinder model training and performance. This paper introduces two strategies to address these issues: 1) Soft Regression Loss (SoRL) and 2) Discrete Quantization Sampling (DQS). SoRL utilizes Gaussian distributions for object predictions, measuring uncertainty based on the probability of ground truth labels within these distributions. This method effectively accounts for deviations in object location and orientation. Meanwhile, DQS introduces uncertainty scores for dynamic sample selection, aiming to refine the quality of positive samples for regression. Based on the proposed modules, we design a lightweight multi-stage object detection framework. Notably, these modules can enhance existing 3D object detection methods without affecting significantly inference speeds. Experiments over benchmark datasets show the effectiveness of our method, especially for cars in sparse point clouds. © 2000-2011 IEEE.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85181558242&doi=10.1109%2fTITS.2023.3334873&partnerID=40&md5=f1f2e6b4785cd0d834f7b52569841334,IEEE Transactions on Intelligent Transportation Systems,2024
Spoofing Detection for LiDAR in Autonomous Vehicles: A Physical-Layer Approach,"Recent years have witnessed the ever-growing interest and adoption of autonomous vehicles (AVs), thanks to the latest advancement in sensing and artificial intelligence (AI) technologies. The LiDAR sensor is adopted by most AV manufacturers for its high precision and high reliability. Unfortunately, LiDARs are susceptible to malicious spoofing attacks, which can lead to severe safety consequences for AVs. Most current work focuses on protecting LiDAR against spoofing attacks by using perception model-level defense methods, whose effectiveness unfortunately depends on the correctness of the LiDAR's sensing outcome. A spoofer thus can elude from these methods as long as it fabricates points that maintain the right contextual relationship held by the legitimate points. In this article, we propose to use the signal's Doppler frequency shift to verify the sender of the signal and detect potential spoofing attacks. To this end, we first thoroughly analyze the working principle of LiDAR and conduct real-world experiments to deeply understand and reveal the vulnerability of LiDAR sensors. We then prove that the Doppler frequency shifts of legitimate and spoofing signals present different characteristics, which can be used to fundamentally protect the LiDAR sensing outcome. For better demonstration purposes, we consider three attack models, including static attacker, moving attacker, and moving attacker with control of both velocity and signal frequency. For each of the models, we first show how the spoofing attack is performed and then present our countermeasures. We then propose a statistical spoofing detection framework to jointly consider the impact of short-term uncertainty in vehicle velocity, which can provide more accurate spoofing detection results in realistic environments. Extensive numerical results are provided in a wide range of settings and road conditions.  © 2014 IEEE.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85187013205&doi=10.1109%2fJIOT.2024.3371378&partnerID=40&md5=6a86f67375bc62308ad1cd39b0ffe19f,IEEE Internet of Things Journal,2024
A Multiobjective Optimization Algorithm for Safety and Optimality of 3-D Route Planning in UAV,"Finding a feasible path for an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) in a complex environment is a crucial part of any UAV mission planning system. Many algorithms have been developed to identify optimal or nearly optimal pathways for UAVs; however, the vast majority of those algorithms do not deal with this problem as multiobjective. Therefore, this study is presented to propose a new multiobjective optimization technique, namely the hybrid slime mould algorithm (HSMA), based on hybridizing the slime mould algorithm with a new updating mechanism to strengthen its performance when applied to tackle the multiobjective path planning problem in 3-D space. This algorithm employs Pareto optimality to tradeoff between various objectives. Those objectives include path optimality for minimizing the fuel cost and consumed time to reach the target location, flying away from threats to ensure safe operation, and finally the smooth cost to assess the climbing and turning rates. HSMA was evaluated using six benchmarking scenarios with various difficulty levels and compared to several recently published and well-established algorithms to show its effectiveness for several performance metrics, such as the convergence curve, Wilcoxon rank-sum test, and inverted generational distance metric. The experimental findings expose that HSMA is more effective than all the compared optimizers in terms of all performance metrics. Hence, it is the best alternative for efficiently creating high-quality pathways for UAVs.  © 1965-2011 IEEE.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85187289068&doi=10.1109%2fTAES.2024.3364139&partnerID=40&md5=2600b10a68d00ab971a8b829ab6a55b1,IEEE Transactions on Aerospace and Electronic Systems,2024

Giant Could Be Tiny: Efficient Inference of Giant Models on Resource-Constrained UAVs,"Giant models, characterized by their billions or even trillions of parameters, has demonstrated unprecedented capabilities in handling complex tasks on artificial intelligence (AI)-driven unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), such as disaster relief, aerial navigation, and manipulation. However, there is an open challenge about the mismatching between the massive computation and memory requirements of giant models and the limited resources on UAVs. Existing works either pose privacy concerns with offloading methods or compromise model accuracy with various model compression techniques. In this article, we fill the gap by exploiting the Mixture-of-Expert (MoE) model architecture that decouples giant models into multiple tiny experts, so that UAVs can dynamically load a few experts that best match their current input. We consider a general scenario of several edge servers feeding experts to multiple UVAs and formulate a core problem of expert selection and UAV-edge association. Due to the high complexity of this problem, we propose a solution, termed GESolver, based on graph learning, which automatically solves the problem by learning the complicated interaction between edge servers, UAVs, as well as their required experts. We evaluate our proposed method with three popular MoE-based models under various problem settings.

Worst Perception Scenario Search via Recurrent Neural Controller and K-Reciprocal Re-Ranking,"Achieving excellent generalization on perceiving real traffic scenarios with diversity is the long-term goal for building robust autonomous driving systems. A recent theoretical study shows that the generalization on the worst-group of test samples is far more difficult than others. Therefore, we propose to discover potential shortness of certain perception module by analyzing its worst-scenario performance. However, with the benchmark datasets growing huge and tremendous, exhaustive searching for the worst perception scenario (WPS) seems to be time consuming and unnecessary. To address this, we present an automatic searching scheme empowered by reinforcement learning. In this case, worst scenario mining is formulated as the discrete search on the Visual Operation Design Domain (ODD), namely scenario representation, by optimizing LSTM-RNN controller with the worst-performance reward. Moreover, a time-efficient K-reciprocal re-ranking technique is utilized to match the predicted scenario parameters with existing test data. The proposed method has been validated by finding the most challenging scenarios for various vehicle detectors on KITTI, BDD100k and our own benchmark set EVB.

Passivity-based stabilizing controller for an underwater robot,"This paper introduces an innovative switching control method to stabilize the posture of an underwater robot. The method leverages the passivity property of the robot's open-loop dynamics and factors in inertial effects that could impact its motion. Its primary goal is to guide the robot's position to a user-defined small level set using a potential function, achieved through consecutive switching. Additionally, the method ensures the convergence of the robot's orientation angle to a desired value. By employing a passivity-based switching control approach, the robot alternates between two submanifolds while reducing the potential function during each switch, ultimately leading the robot's position to the potential function's minimum. Through exploiting the passivity property of the robot's dynamics, the method designs a controller to stabilize the robot's posture using a switching strategy guided by the potential function. Results indicate that this method effectively stabilizes the posture of the underwater robot, surpassing conventional control methods in terms of stability and convergence rate. © 2024 Elsevier Ltd",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85189497248&doi=10.1016%2fj.oceaneng.2024.117656&partnerID=40&md5=b6ccae40c28d6273a1c476eb10348771,Ocean Engineering,2024
Design of Tiny Contrastive Learning Network With Noise Tolerance for Unauthorized Device Identification in Internet of UAVs,"Artificial intelligence enhanced Internet of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) is a promising network to achieve the complicated vehicular tasks and construct intelligent communication networks. One of the critical tasks is to guarantee a secure network access while achieving tradeoff between accuracy and latency through lightweight deployment on resource-limited and hardware-constrained UAVs. To address this issue, a novel noise-tolerant radio frequency fingerprinting (NT-RFF) based on tiny machine learning (TinyML) scheme is proposed, which amalgamates contrastive learning and data augmentation, aiming to improve the generalization ability of unauthorized device identification (UDI). Particularly, we first exploit the augmentation technique to enhance the legitimate training data sets under the circumstance of varying signal-to-noise ratios, facilitating an enhanced and diversified data sets. Second, a synthesis of contrastive learning and supervised learning is employed to attain comprehensive global learning. We design a new contrastive loss criteria to capture relevant information from the samples collected over the air. Besides, we design a categorical cross-entropy loss criteria by which supervisory information can be leveraged from associated labels. Finally, quantification is utilized to enhance model efficiency and achieve an optimal balance between accuracy and latency within computing and energy resource-limited UAVs. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed tiny NT-RFF which only contains about 25-30% quantitative parameters can maintain excellent performance and improve the UDI accuracy greatly compared with the traditional machine learning-based RFF schemes.

BEVSOC: Self-Supervised Contrastive Learning for Calibration-Free BEV 3-D Object Detection,"3-D object detection based on multiview cameras and bird's-eye view (BEV) representation is a key task for autonomous driving, as it enables the perception systems to understand the surrounding scenes. However, most existing BEV representation methods rely on the projection matrix of camera intrinsic and extrinsic parameters, which requires a complex and time-consuming calibration process that may introduce errors and degrade the detection performance. Moreover, the calibration results may vary due to environmental changes and affect the stability of the detection system. To address this problem, we propose a calibration-free 3-D object detection method that leverages a group-equivariant convolutional network to extract features from multiview images and a projection network module to learn the implicit 3D-to-2D projection relationship for obtaining BEV representation. Furthermore, we employ contrastive learning (CL) to pretrain the projection network module without using manually annotated data. By exploiting the multiview camera data through CL, our proposed method eliminates the need for tedious calibration, avoids calibration errors, and reduces the dependence on a large amount of annotated data for calibration-free 3-D object detection. We evaluate our method on the nuScenes data set and demonstrate its competitive performance. Our method improves the stability and reliability of 3-D object detection in long-term autonomous driving.  © 2014 IEEE.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85188471878&doi=10.1109%2fJIOT.2024.3379471&partnerID=40&md5=07aa312c1aa60853f986a89932a42ecf,IEEE Internet of Things Journal,2024
Network-Based Modeling and Sampling Guaranteed Cost Control for Unmanned Surface Vehicle Systems under Stochastic Cyber-Attacks,"The future extensive usage of continuous measurable communication network for output feedback control in unmanned surface vehicle (USV) will inevitably increase the control cost, waste energy, and even reduce the system performance under stochastic cyber attacks. However, the existing study largely ignores the guaranteed cost control of USV under stochastic cyber attacks. To fill the knowledge gap, this paper attempts to focus on the guarantee cost control of USV systems by taking into account the finite measurable output sampling information and stochastic cyber attacks. Initially, a point output sampling control strategy based on finite measurable output sampling information is proposed, which has a strong application background and important theoretical research value in the field of power grid security. On this basis, a new stochastic composite system containing both system state and output sampling information is developed. Subsequently, a sampling-time-dependent Lyapunov function (LYFU) is exploited to ensure the workable criteria of the cost sampling controller, which can not only stabilize the stochastic composite system by means of the mean square exponential stability, but also reveal the upper bound (UPBO) of the quadratic cost function (COFU). Specially, in the strict sensu of minimizing the UPBO of the COFU, a meaningful design method for a suboptimal guaranteed cost output sampling controller is designed, which is a modulus-related LMI optimization algorithm. Finally, numerical simulation results of USV and additional vehicle lateral motion model are developed to demonstrate the validity and rationality of the proposed design method. © 2000-2011 IEEE.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85182928250&doi=10.1109%2fTITS.2023.3348841&partnerID=40&md5=a473006ff7771bc00e8dc8681869ee55,IEEE Transactions on Intelligent Transportation Systems,2024
Defense and Tolerance Technique Against Attacks and Faults on Leader-Following Multi-USVs,"This study explores the leader-following consensus tracking control issue of multiple unmanned surface vehicles (multi-USVs) in the presence of malicious connectivity-mixed attacks in the cyber layer, and concurrent output channel noises, sensor/actuator faults, and wave-induced disturbances in the physical layer. Sensor/actuator faults are initially modeled with unified incipient and abrupt features. Additionally, connectivity-mixed attacks are depicted using connectivity-paralyzed and connectivity-maintained topologies through nonoverlapping and switching iterations. The standardization and observer design in multi-USVs are incorporated to decouple the augmented dynamics and estimate unknown state, fault, and noise observations, and then a defense and fault-tolerant consensus tracking control approach is designed to accomplish the robustness to disturbances/noises, resilience to attacks, and tolerance to faults, simultaneously. The criteria for achieving leader-following exponential consensus tracking of multi-USVs with cyber-physical threats can be determined based on activation rate and attack frequency indicators. Comparative simulations outline the effectiveness and economy of the proposed defense and tolerance technique against sensor/actuator faults and cyber-attacks on multi-USVs.  © 2000-2011 IEEE.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85178034542&doi=10.1109%2fTITS.2023.3330570&partnerID=40&md5=f4316a02979e3ec2713db77c62808025,IEEE Transactions on Intelligent Transportation Systems,2024
Cyber-Physical Intrusion Detection System for Unmanned Aerial Vehicles,"The increasing reliance on unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) has escalated the associated cyber risks. While machine learning has enabled intrusion detection systems (IDSs), current IDSs do not incorporate cyber-physical UAV features, which limits their detection performance. Additionally, the lack of public UAV's cyber and physical datasets to develop IDS hinders further research. Therefore, this paper proposes a novel IDS fusing UAV cyber and physical features to improve detection capabilities. First, we developed a testbed that includes UAV, controller, and data collection tools to execute cyber-attacks and gather cyber and physical data under normal and attack conditions. We made this dataset publicly available. The dataset covers a range of cyber-attacks including denial-of-service, replay, evil twin, and false data injection attacks. Then, machine learning-based IDSs fusing cyber and physical features were trained to detect cyber-attacks using support vector machines, feedforward neural networks, recurrent neural networks with long short-term memory cells, and convolutional neural networks. Extensive experiments were conducted on varying complexity and range of attack training data to explore whether (a) fusion of cyber and physical features enhances detection performance compared to cyber or physical features alone, (b) fusion enhances detection when IDS is trained on a single attack type and tested on unseen attacks of varying complexity, (c) fusion enhances performance when the range of attack training data increases and models are tested on unseen attacks. Answering these research questions provides insights into IDS capabilities using cyber, physical, and cyber-physical features under different conditions. © 2000-2011 IEEE.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85181566533&doi=10.1109%2fTITS.2023.3339728&partnerID=40&md5=424a8abab1318b7d2dfb7fce4bd57057,IEEE Transactions on Intelligent Transportation Systems,2024
A Flexible Load Balancing Scheme in Multi-UAV-Enabled Wireless Networks,"Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) equipped with communication modules can act as mobile base stations. In this paper, we focus on load balancing in multi-UAV-enabled wireless networks, where UAVs serve ground user equipments (UEs) with time division multiple access (TDMA). The UEs have spatiotemporal heterogeneous requests to transfer data which need to be fulfilled in time, the unfinished part called unfinished user request. To improve the quality of service (QoS) and promote the overall system performance, we exploit the flexibility of UAVs to propose a flexible and efficient multi-UAV-enabled load balancing (MULB) scheme. Taking the load balancing effect into consideration, the network optimization problem is formulated as minimizing the maximum unfinished user request by jointly optimizing user association, UAV trajectory, and time slot allocation. Due to integer constraints and non-convexity, we exploit block coordinate descent (BCD) and successive convex approximation to solve it efficiently. Simulation results show that our proposed MULB scheme outperforms existing multi-UAV scheduling schemes in terms of not only the load balancing ability but also the overall system throughput. © 1967-2012 IEEE.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85183958322&doi=10.1109%2fTVT.2024.3356753&partnerID=40&md5=9b905da22fac8988b149d503501b6e23,IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology,2024
Bias-Compensation Augmentation Learning for Semantic Segmentation in UAV Networks,"In the realm of emergency disaster relief, it is paramount to attain a thorough comprehension of the semantic information associated with the local disaster scene for strategic rescue path planning and immediate rescue operations for affected individuals. Unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) networks are widely utilized for rapid data collection in the aftermath of disasters due to their flexibility and maneuverability, assisting in rescue decision-making. However, some disasters, such as seismic events and floods, have disrupted the initially structured ground shape information, leading to a disparate distribution of data collected by various UAV groups. This exposes traditional semantic segmentation models susceptible to shortcut bias, posing challenges in adapting to semantic segmentation tasks in disaster scenarios. Thus, this article proposes a bias-compensation augmentation learning-based semantic segmentation framework, which substantially enhances the extraction capability of semantic information. Initially, we exploit an artificial augmentation neural network for bias-awareness to determine the relative bias values of the collected image data. Subsequently, considering the limited computing power resources in UAV networks, we present a bias compensation computation offloading strategy to achieve a relatively balanced distribution of semantic information across UAV nodes, optimizing the tradeoff between network scheduling efficiency and model accuracy. We conduct reconstruction validation on the FloodNet data set, and a plethora of experimental results demonstrate that, compared to traditional methods, this approach greatly improves the accuracy of pixel-level semantic segmentation by over 86.5%. Moreover, the average combined processing time is also reduced by over 50%, enhancing the utilization efficiency of limited computational resources.  © 2014 IEEE.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85188463607&doi=10.1109%2fJIOT.2024.3373454&partnerID=40&md5=8542946921006a2702ab36442e1f710d,IEEE Internet of Things Journal,2024
Learning-Based Energy Minimization Optimization for IRS-Assisted Master-Auxiliary-UAV-Enabled Wireless-Powered IoT Networks,"This article investigates master-auxiliary unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs)-enabled wireless-powered Internet of Things (WPIoT) networks, which overcome the inflexibility and site selection issues caused by traditional fixed-point intelligent reflecting surface (IRS). Specifically, multiple rechargeable master UAVs (MUAVs) and IRS-integrated auxiliary UAVs (AUAVs) are applied in pairs to cooperatively charge and collect data from Internet of Things devices clustered in different subareas under cloud scheduling. Given the constraints of limited onboard battery capacity and complete data collection, we formulate a system energy minimization problem, which is then divided into three subproblems. We first utilize a pair of U-nets with quantization layers trained by deep unsupervised learning (DUL) to output discrete downlink (DL) and uplink (UL) IRS phases separately. Gradient functions with specific features are also proposed to solve nondifferentiable issue during training. Given the optimized IRS phase policies, off-policy deep reinforcement learning (DRL) is exploited to optimize intrasubarea data collection policy and intersubarea multi-UAV scheduling scheme. Two assistive techniques, positive transition initialization (PTI) and action mask, are proposed to guide the learning of the agent and alleviate the burden of optimization. Numerical results indicate that our proposed approach combining DUL with DRL can improve performance by more than 90% compared to the pure DRL method. Furthermore, our proposed master-auxiliary-UAV collaborative data collection scheme (MACS) can achieve better energy performance than homogeneous MUAV data collection scheme (HMCS) in cases with low-onboard battery capacity while halving task completion time.  © 2014 IEEE.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85188005806&doi=10.1109%2fJIOT.2024.3377430&partnerID=40&md5=7b33bbf8f58ecc6df08006ece3c1fc52,IEEE Internet of Things Journal,2024
Secure Transmission Design of RIS Enabled UAV Communication Networks Exploiting Deep Reinforcement Learning,"Reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS) enables performance enhancement of communication networks due to its significant reflective gain, which could also be used to strengthen secure transmission. In this article, we consider a RIS enabled unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) communication network, in which the UAV serves as a base station for a terrestrial legitimate user accompanied by a terrestrial eavesdropper. Specifically, security performance of the considered network is enhanced under both instantaneous and statistical eavesdropper channel state information (CSI). To maximize the average secrecy rate and minimize the secrecy outage duration, the trajectory and beamformer of UAV and the phase shift matrix of RIS are jointly optimized. For the instantaneous CSI scenario, we propose a successive convex approximation (SCA) based algorithm as a baseline solution, where the collective optimization problem is decomposed into three subproblems and solved separately. After that, benefiting from the state-of-the-art proximal policy optimization (PPO) algorithm, a deep reinforcement learning (DRL) based algorithm is developed to solve the average secrecy rate maximization problem from a holistic perspective. For the statistical CSI case, the close-form expression of secrecy outage probability (SOP) is derived to expound the secrecy outage duration. Since the secrecy outage duration minimization problem is hard to be solved via the SCA based algorithm, the developed DRL based algorithm is utilized again. Simulation results demonstrate that compared with benchmark algorithms, both the security performance and complexity of the proposed DRL based algorithm are competitive. © 1967-2012 IEEE.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85184023789&doi=10.1109%2fTVT.2024.3357821&partnerID=40&md5=9134b88687d0ac28492ef4781fe894cb,IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology,2024
Optimization of Placement and Resource Allocation in UAV-Aided Multihop Wireless Networks,"This article investigates the performance of cellular networks assisted by unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) acting as flying base stations (FlyBSs). We focus on a scenario with multihop relaying via FlyBSs to deliver data from a ground base station (GBS) to users in a challenging case with the channels reused at all hops to exploit radio resources efficiently. Our objective is to maximize the sum capacity of the users via an optimization of FlyBSs' position in 3-D, association of users to either GBS or to one of the FlyBSs, allocation of channels for communication at individual hops, and allocation of transmission power for all channels. Moreover, practical constraints on the FlyBSs' movement, transmission and propulsion power, and backhaul capacity are taken into account. Due to a nonconvexity and discreetness of the objective and some constraints, there is no optimal solution to the formulated problem. Thus, we propose an analytical solution based on an alternating optimization of an energy-efficient placement of the FlyBSs, channel allocation, user association, and transmission power. Each subproblem in the alternating optimization is substituted either by a linear programming (LP) problem through a change of variables, or by a convex problem via a conversion of the objective and constraints. The results show an increase in sum capacity by 35%-60% compared to related works while the FlyBSs' propulsion power consumption is not increased.  © 2014 IEEE.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85186106695&doi=10.1109%2fJIOT.2024.3369174&partnerID=40&md5=00de3f0ed3b0c522b9e615955cbcfbfa,IEEE Internet of Things Journal,2024
Privacy-Preserving Authentication Scheme for Connected Autonomous Vehicles,"Ensuring the security of the Internet of Vehicles (IoV) has been a challenging task, particularly due to the high mobility rate of the many elements in the network. With vehicles constantly moving and frequently exchanging data, authentication is crucial for maintaining security. We propose a new approach based on group authentication to handle authentication of several units simultaneously while protecting privacy in an IoV environment. The proposed protocol is designed to perform an authentication and handover process of multiple users within a predefined group. The group authentication based approach ensures privacy of users as the group members' identification is systematically redefined after each group exchange process. Thus, the proposed scheme is designed to offer a promising solution to security challenges within the IoV environment by simultaneously addressing scalability and protecting the privacy of user data. Additionally, our scheme is resistant to various types of attacks, including offline ID attacks, replay attacks, location spoofing attacks, and replay attacks. Comprehensive tests have been conducted and the results are presented in the analysis section, both in terms of the computational cost and the running times, which reveal that the proposed method demonstrates remarkable practicality when compared to the existing approaches. © 2000-2011 IEEE.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85180342111&doi=10.1109%2fTITS.2023.3338060&partnerID=40&md5=1aba8d49e04aaf18f0ae2c584ac5eb90,IEEE Transactions on Intelligent Transportation Systems,2024
MR-FFL: A Stratified Community-Based Mutual Reliability Framework for Fairness-Aware Federated Learning in Heterogeneous UAV Networks,"Fairness-aware federated learning (FFL) plays a crucial role in mitigating bias against specific demographic groups (e.g., gender, race, and occupation) during collaborative training. Along with the ever-emerging new attack paradigms like gradient leakage and model poisoning, the reliability of FFL also obtains lots of research attention. Either UAV nodes or FFL aggregators could be untrusted adversaries. Although multiple security mechanisms involving encryption, obfuscation, Byzantine-robustness, and detection have been proposed, concrete to UAV networks, the majority of existing solutions are unfeasible due to high heterogeneity and limited resources among participants. Hence, in this article, we propose mutually reliable FFL (MR-FFL), a stratified community-based framework to facilitate privacy protection (FFL aggregator's reliability) and poisoning elimination (client nodes' reliability) jointly for FFL in heterogeneous UAV networks. We first divide UAV nodes into both peer communities (PCs) and colleague communities (CCs) according to cross-participant similarity and task-oriented fitness, respectively. Thus, the arbitrarily settled learning tasks following fair principles can be efficiently completed by fine-tuned CCs, even in the presence of a large degree of heterogeneity among PCs. Then, we integrate community-specific differential privacy into the MR-FFL process, to achieve privacy amplification as well as efficient and personal collaborative training at the same time. More importantly, we proposed a community-based credit evaluation to resist poisoning attacks in heterogeneous environments. The results on several standard data sets also highlight the performance of MR-Fed in terms of fairness, accuracy, and integrity jointly.  © 2014 IEEE.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85183939261&doi=10.1109%2fJIOT.2024.3357779&partnerID=40&md5=09722d9e800290467d2576a2de64cefa,IEEE Internet of Things Journal,2024
Robust Indoor Positioning of Automated Guided Vehicles in Internet of Things Networks With Deep Convolution Neural Network Considering Adversarial Attacks,"The effectiveness of positioning techniques that utilize the receiver signal strength (RSS) is highly dependent on the instability of the received signal strength indicator (RSSI). Up to now, there is no strategy that effectively lowers the influence of such instability on the accuracy of positioning. Moreover, recent studies showed that indoor positioning techniques are vulnerable to noise in RSSI data and cyber-attacks, which make them more expensive. In this study, a new Internet of Things (IoT) paradigm is proposed for the indoor positioning of automated guided vehicles (AGVs) using a deep convolution neural network (CNN). The proposed method handles signal processing by converting the RSSI signal into an image. In which, the 1-D RSSI signal is converted into 2-D image data in order to generate the new features based on continuous wavelet transform (CWT), and then the proposed deep CNN is implemented for the indoor positioning system. The test results show that the proposed model can outperform other state-of-the-art positioning techniques with small position errors. Furthermore, the robustness of the proposed model is validated against various adversarial attacks. In addition, the proposed method can have a lower impact on RSSI change compared with other methods. © 1967-2012 IEEE.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85183964741&doi=10.1109%2fTVT.2024.3357780&partnerID=40&md5=b5a84a10239502890d7fd3e209ba310c,IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology,2024
A Security Enhanced Chaotic-Map-Based Authentication Protocol for Internet of Drones,"The Internet of Drones (IoD) extends the capabilities of unmanned aerial vehicles, enabling them to participate in a connected network. In IoD infrastructure, drones communicate not only among themselves but also with users and a control center. This interconnected communication framework holds promise for various applications, from collaborative decision-making to real-time data exchange. However, the expansion of communication in IoD also introduces new challenges, particularly in terms of security, privacy and authentication. Unfortunately, the current authentication protocols are inadequate in offering robust security features against various attacks in the IoD environment. To address these security issues and limitations, we proposed a secure protocol for the IoD environment using chaotic maps and hash functions. In addition, we also employed a physically unclonable function in the development of the proposed protocol. We assess the security of the protocol through both informal and formal security analysis. The formal security analysis is conducted through a widely used random or real (RoR) model. The informal analysis shows the rigorous security features against various attacks, such as masquerading, anonymity violation, and physical cloning attacks. Moreover, we compare the performance of the devised protocol with similar existing protocols across important performance parameters, such as communication overhead, computation overhead, and security features. The devised protocol provides a 67.86% and 17.80% reduction in computation and communication overheads, respectively, as compared to related protocols. The analysis demonstrates the proposed protocol's capacity to support secure communication in the IoD environment and satisfy desirable security attributes.  © 2014 IEEE.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85188881127&doi=10.1109%2fJIOT.2024.3379930&partnerID=40&md5=f123a13d392f25bf6e7f2bd21fe7eefe,IEEE Internet of Things Journal,2024
Post-Quantum Authentication Against Cyber-Physical Attacks in V2X-Based Autonomous Vehicle Platoon,"In this paper, we propose a platoon access authentication system for initial access process in autonomous vehicle platoons (AVPs) in which post-quantum encryption and signal processing techniques are employed to protect against both active and passive cyber-physical attacks. To avoid passive quantum cyber attacks, a quasi-cyclic moderate-density parity-check code is used to encode and decode AVP messages. Moreover, an independent component analysis-based signal separation technique is employed to eliminate the effect of high-power active cyber attacks on AVP messages. To measure the reliability of the system, we derive an analytical expression for the system failure probability, taking into account the influence of both the cyber and physical planes. The simulations show that the proposed system is effective against attacks and can help reduce system failures caused by intentional and unintentional adverse cyber-physical effects.

On the Performance of Cooperative IoT Using NOMA With Indoor-Outdoor Device Deployment,"This work studies applying power-domain downlink nonorthogonal multiple accesses (NOMA) to connect devices in urban environments to nearby Internet of Things (IoT). Therefore, attenuation caused by walls and other obstacles is exploited to treat indoor devices akin to far users in conventional NOMA.

To capture a wide range of small-scale fading scenarios, the outdoor channel is modeled using the generalized κ-μ fading. The performance of this system is analytically evaluated by deriving accurate closed-form expressions for the outage probability, erodic capacity, throughput, and energy efficiency.

MFGD3QN: Enhancing Edge Intelligence Defense Against DDoS With Mean-Field Games and Dueling Double Deep Q-Network,"Distributed Denial-of-Service (DDoS) attacks pose a serious threat to the stability and security of edge intelligence devices (EIDs). To solve this issue, we first describe the cost of edge intelligence environments in detail and introduce the mean-field term, edge intelligence repair speed, and DDoS attack intensity, which provide a theoretical basis for the subsequent model construction. Second, based on Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman backward and Fokker-Planck-Kolmogorov forward equations, a mean-field model is proposed. The optimal DDoS defense policy is then solved considering the strongest DDoS attack intensity and the best EID repair speed. Further, the focus is turned to the interaction between DDoS attackers and the edge intelligence environment. We give the update rule of the mean-field term and construct a mean-field game (MFG) model with a value function. Finally, we propose a multiagent deep reinforcement learning algorithm called MFGs with dueling double deep Q-learning network (MFGD3QN) to solve the optimal DDoS defense policy problem under the MFG model. In the experiment, we compare MFGD3QN with several benchmark algorithms and verify the superiority of the MFGD3QN algorithm in an edge intelligence environment.

Cooperative task allocation with simultaneous arrival and resource constraint for multi-UAV using a genetic algorithm,"In recent years, the application of multi-UAV cooperation systems has expanded across various domains. Enhancing the coordination performance of multi-UAV systems can be achieved through task allocation methods, typically relying on a hierarchical structure. This paper proposes a novel approach using a modified genetic algorithm (GA) to address the integrated task allocation and path planning problems for multi-UAV attacking multi-target. To create a more realistic mission scenario, multiple constraints, such as resource requirement and simultaneous target arrival, are considered. The modified GA incorporates tailored crossover and mutation operators that ensure compliance with the aforementioned constraints. Furthermore, an unlocking strategy is devised to prevent the occurrence of a chromosome deadlock condition, in which several UAVs become stuck in an infinite waiting state. Through simulation results, the modified GA is demonstrated to effectively delivers feasible solutions to the coupled task allocation and path planning problems, preserving the integrated nature of the optimization process.

Cascade fusion of multi-modal and multi-source feature fusion by the attention for three-dimensional object detection,"Three dimensional (3D) object detection using the camera and light detection and ranging (LiDAR) fusion model has received much attention for meeting the environmental sensing requirement in autonomous vehicles. Due to the intrinsic data difference and the uneven distribution of LiDAR data, integrating the camera and LiDAR to solve the problem of the uneven spatial distribution of LiDAR data is still challenging. This paper proposes a novel 3D detector, which decorates the point cloud voxels with the semantic features at multi-scale and fuses the multi-source features by cross-attention to improve the detection performance. Specifically, the multi-modal fusion aims to maintain the cross-modal consistency by using the frustum model to construct the correspondence between point voxels and image pixels at multi-scale. To fully exploit the geometric constraints of voxels, we developed a adaptive sampling radius module to dynamically select the sampling radius of the voxel set abstraction module based on softmax. Moreover, we propose a multi-source fusion module which utilizes the cross-attention and takes the raw point cloud's spatial distribution as the clue to fuse the features of point clouds, bird's eye view information and the aggregated voxels to obtain the multi-scale and multi-source fusion features.

UAV-Taken Wind Turbine Image Dehazing With a Double-Patch Lightweight Neural Network,"Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) offer a solution for remote inspection of wind turbines (WTs). However, in stormy weather conditions, the visual quality of UAV-taken images is affected by contaminated suspended atmospheric particles. To address this problem, a double-patch lightweight convolutional dehazing neural network (DPLDN) is proposed to reconstruct hazy images and enhance the image quality. Unlike other learning-based methods that measure transmission map and atmospheric light separately, the proposed DPLDN uses a transformed atmospheric scattering model to jointly transmission map and atmospheric light, employs depth-separable convolution instead of conventional convolution, and splits the image into double patches. In addition, a super-resolution reconstruction method is proposed to transform the processed low-resolution images into higher-quality images. Extensive experiments show that our proposed method has better dehazing performance compared to other state-of-the-art image dehazing techniques. Meanwhile, the applicability of the method in WT blade image segmentation is experimentally verified.  © 2014 IEEE.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85177032324&doi=10.1109%2fJIOT.2023.3331442&partnerID=40&md5=916243a6737caa1dabc5d3e3110714c9,IEEE Internet of Things Journal,2024
Exhaustive distributed intrusion detection system for UAVs attacks detection and security enforcement (E-DIDS),"Distributed intrusion detection systems (DIDS) are a specialized subset of conventional IDSs designed for implementation in distributed environments. Each IDS is integrated into distinct entities within a monitored network, potentially distributed across various locations. These participating IDSs can be configured to detect either a particular or multiple attack types. Although DIDS has found extensive application in diverse IoT systems, its utilization in unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) still needs to be explored. Consequently, it is imperative to devise a comprehensive framework tailored explicitly for UAVs. It combines multiple detection units to enhance security. Based on the insights gained from previous studies, we propose an exhaustive DIDS for UAVs security enforcement in this paper. Our proposed solution offers a robust and scalable security approach. Through distributing the workload across interconnected IDSs deployed on the UAV, our solution was optimized for UAVs attacks detection to achieve high detection performance while reducing the complexity. To the best of our insight, there is no recorded DIDS for UAVs security, and attack detection has been proposed and evaluated. Furthermore, our paper provides a detailed analysis, outlining the development basis and the achieved results. We performed multiple experiments over different cases using different datasets. The achieved experimental results demonstrate that the proposed IDS has significantly high accuracy detection and low loss rates. Our proposed E-DIDS efficiently detects multiple attacks on different UAVs subsets with good global accuracy that reached 98.6% and low resource consumption. © 2024 Elsevier Ltd",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85191898023&doi=10.1016%2fj.cose.2024.103878&partnerID=40&md5=3a83e8a685008a768a86eea3739cda08,Computers and Security,2024
Experimental and numerical study on the adjustment of twin hydrofoils of a variable-structure SWATH,"The form-changeable unmanned surface vehicles (USVs) have garnered considerable research interest due to their wide-ranging applicability and robust combat capabilities. This paper specifically addresses the longitudinal motion stability of a variable-structure Small Waterplane Area Twin-hull Ship (SWATH) equipped with twin hydrofoils, aiming to evaluate the impact of hydrofoils on sailing attitudes. Initially, model tests were systematically conducted under different form-states, both with and without hydrofoils, in calm water conditions. Subsequently, verification and validation of computational fluid dynamics (CFD) simulations were performed against the experimental results. Finally, strategies to mitigate bow-diving during high-speed tests were proposed based on the validated CFD simulations, focusing on adjusting hydrofoil attack angles. The test results indicate that with outwardly spreading struts, the bow tends to dip down more as speed increases. Model tests, combined with CFD simulations, serve as a reference for stable sailing at full speeds, presenting strategies for adjusting attack angles under varying form-states and speeds. Moreover, effective foil adjustment modes are identified to suppress bow-diving, considering thrust. Strategies for adjusting attack angles during the acceleration process are summarized, verifying the stability of the optimal 10° form-state at high speeds. © 2024",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85189756866&doi=10.1016%2fj.oceaneng.2024.117712&partnerID=40&md5=0c2c6648e6c6a50e075c4719e17d06ea,Ocean Engineering,2024
Unmanned Aerial Vehicle-enabled grassland restoration with energy-sensitive of trajectory design and restoration areas allocation via a cooperative memetic algorithm,"Grassland restoration is a crucial method for preventing ecological degradation in grasslands. Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) offer a promising solution to reduce extensive human labor and enhance restoration efficiency, given their fully automatic capabilities, yet their full potential remains exploited. This paper progresses this emerging technology for planning the grassland restoration. We undertake the first attempt to mathematically model the UAV-enabled restoration process as the maximization of restoration areas problem (MRAP). This model considers factors including limited UAV battery energy, grass seed weight, the number of restored areas, and their sizes. The MRAP is a composite problem involving trajectory design and area allocation, which are highly coupled and conflicting. Consequently, it requires solving two NP-hard subproblems: the variant Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP) and the Multidimensional Knapsack Problem (MKP) simultaneously. To address this complex problem, we introduce a novel cooperative memetic algorithm. The algorithm integrates an efficient heuristic algorithm, variant population-based incremental learning (PBIL), and a maximum-residual-energy-based local search (MRELS) strategy, referred to as CHAPBILM. The algorithm solves the two subproblems interlacedly by leveraging the interdependencies and inherent knowledge between them. The simulation results demonstrate that CHAPBILM successfully solves the MRAP on multiple instances in a near-optimal way. It also confirms the conflicts between trajectory design and area allocation. The effectiveness of CHAPBILM is further supported by comparisons with traditional optimization methods that do not exploit the interdependencies between the two subproblems. The proposed model and solution have the potential to be extended to other complex optimization problems in ecological protection and precision agriculture. © 2024",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85185195378&doi=10.1016%2fj.engappai.2024.108084&partnerID=40&md5=c6495af906e70a9c4828e3757e5fa2b4,Engineering Applications of Artificial Intelligence,2024
BWM Integrated VIKOR method using Neutrosophic fuzzy sets for cybersecurity risk assessment of connected and autonomous vehicles,"Connected and autonomous vehicles (CAVs) have gained significant importance in intelligent transportation systems. However, CAVs are associated with significant cyber-risks caused by different threat-agents, which require robust mitigation strategies for secure operation. Different categories of threat-agents come with varying resources, motivation, and skills that must be addressed effectively for the secure operation of CAVs. This study offers a comprehensive analysis of cybersecurity risks from different categories of threat-agents targeting CAVs. A novel hybrid multi-criteria decision making (MCDM) technique has been developed to prioritize the threat-agent categories as part of the cyber defense mechanism. In this study, the major threat-agent categories are identified from the existing literature and cybersecurity reports. Then expert opinion is collected on the likelihood and severity of cyber-attacks undertaken by different threat-agent categories. Single-valued neutrosophic fuzzy sets (SVNFS) are implemented to consolidate the subjectivity of the linguistic opinions given by the experts. Then Best-Worst Method (BWM) is used to determine the relative criteria weightage on the cyber-attack consequences. These weights are then supplied to the ViseKriterijum-ska Optimizacija I Kompromisno Resenj (VIKOR) method for ranking the categories of threat-agents based on the risk perceived by the experts. A case study is presented with five categories of threat-agents and five loss criteria targeting CAVs to validate the viability of the proposed model. The result shows that insider attackers pose maximum risk for cybersecurity of CAVs. The proposed technique will provide helpful insights to the decision-makers for formulating effective defense strategies against cyber-attackers. © 2024 Elsevier B.V.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85192143378&doi=10.1016%2fj.asoc.2024.111628&partnerID=40&md5=9558faa7f4bf7faa5b326822b3f38f28,Applied Soft Computing,2024
Innovative differential evolution algorithm with double-layer coding for autonomous underwater vehicles path planning in complex environments,"Path planning for autonomous underwater vehicles (AUV) involves determining a safe path that satisfies multiple constraints while minimizing path length in the complex environment. Specifically, it is quite essential to select to path points is essential to construct a feasible path, ensuring AUVs’ safe navigation past obstacles. However, the abundant path points significantly increase the computational cost and can easily lead to algorithm oscillations. This study employs a novel double-layer coding (DLC) model, which can remove the invalid path points. In addition, in order to solve the AUV path planning problem effectively in complex environments, an improved differential evolution (IDE) algorithm is proposed. Firstly, this study proposes a novel adaptive elite neighborhood learning (AENL) strategy to balance the exploitation and exploration abilities of IDE in solving complex problems. Secondly, a rank-guided crossover probability selection (RCPS) strategy is introduced to retain elite individuals’ information effectively. Finally, this study also explores a novel distance-greedy selection (DGS) strategy that enhances the diversity of the population while maintaining convergence accuracy. From the visualizing convergence process experiment and the ablation experiment, it can be concluded that IDE has a superior convergence capability and that the improvement strategies used have contributed positively. Moreover, by combining DLC with IDE to form DLC-IDE and comparing it with three state-of-the-art algorithms in three complex underwater environments with different hazard levels, the proposed algorithm exhibits higher robustness and superior availability. © 2024 Elsevier Ltd",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85189861131&doi=10.1016%2fj.oceaneng.2024.117806&partnerID=40&md5=12336718ac622e78de384371909b216d,Ocean Engineering,2024
UAV autonomous source seeking with cumulative exposure minimization in complex hazardous environments,"Considering autonomous searching for an unknown source in complex hazardous environments while balancing search efficiency and flight safety, this paper proposes a framework called source seeking with cumulative exposure minimization (SSCEM) for an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) equipped with gas sensors. First, the hazardous substance dispersion is formulated by using an isotropic plume model, and the stochastic sensor measurement in turbulent environments is modeled as a Poisson distribution. Second, the source term including the source location and release rate, is estimated by using a Bayesian inference framework. A particle filter is adopted to reduce the computational burden. Third, as cumulative exposure to hazardous fields can lead to airborne device failures and endanger flight safety, to achieve a reasonable trade-off among exploitation, exploration and flight safety, SSCEM for UAVs is proposed based on information theory and an interfered fluid dynamical system (IFDS), where heuristic action candidates in a continuous domain and a cost function considering cumulative exposure collectively drive the UAV to approach the unknown source location while reducing cumulative exposure, and no-fly zone avoidance is realized using the IFDS. Eventually, source seeking is efficiently performed by the UAV with no-fly zone avoidance and kinematic requirements being met, and comparative simulation results demonstrate the performance of SSCEM. © 2024 Elsevier Masson SAS",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85196828893&doi=10.1016%2fj.ast.2024.109330&partnerID=40&md5=6de79a9cf020a1a31d63709c72093e9b,Aerospace Science and Technology,2024
Shooting condition insensitive unmanned aerial vehicle object detection,"The increasing use of unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) devices in diverse fields such as agriculture, surveillance, and aerial photography has led to a significant demand for intelligent object detection. The key is in dealing with unconstrained shooting condition variations (e.g., weather, view, altitude). Previous data augmentation or adversarial learning based methods try to extract shooting condition invariant features, but they are constrained by the large number of combinations of different shooting conditions. To address this limitation, in this work we introduce a novel Language Guided UAV Detection Network Training Method (LGNet), capable of leveraging pre-trained multi-modal representations (e.g., CLIP) as learning structure reference, and as a model-agnostic strategy that can be applied in various detection models. The key idea is to remove language-described domain-specific features from the visual-language feature space, enhancing tolerance to variations in shooting conditions. Concretely, we fine-tune text prompt embedding about shooting condition and feed the fine-tuned text prompt embedding into CLIP-text encoder to obtain more accurate domain-specific features. By aligning the features from the detector backbone with those of the CLIP image encoder, we situate features within a visual-language space, while staying away from language-encoded domain-specific features to be domain-invariant. Extensive experiments demonstrate that LGNet, as a generic training plug-in, boosts the state-of-the-art performance on various base detectors. Specifically, it achieves an increase in the range of 0.9–1.7% in Average Precision (AP) on the UAVDT dataset and 1.0–2.4% on the VisDrone dataset, respectively. © 2024 Elsevier Ltd",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85183465319&doi=10.1016%2fj.eswa.2024.123221&partnerID=40&md5=952943883cc46228c75bd27483140b3d,Expert Systems with Applications,2024
Defense penetration strategy for unmanned surface vehicle based on modified soft actor–critic,"This paper investigates the defense penetration problem for unmanned surface vehicle (USV) with limited detection range under unknown defenders. A novel end-to-end defense penetration strategy is proposed for the USV based on modified soft actor–critic (MSAC). Specifically, the state–action space of the attacker is designed by combining the maneuvering model of USV and detection information. To guide the USV to reach the target area under the interception of defenders, the penetration reward is constructed. Then, the long short-term memory network (LSTM) is applied in the actor–critic network design. A dynamic training mechanism is proposed by combining curriculum learning and multi-memory pools, which aims to improve the success rate of defense penetration. Finally, simulation results validate the effectiveness and superiority of the proposed defense penetration method for the USV suffering from unknown defenders. The higher success rate can be guaranteed by using MSAC compared to the previous methods. © 2024 Elsevier Ltd",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85190457060&doi=10.1016%2fj.oceaneng.2024.117840&partnerID=40&md5=e8df3ec249f8c5da3ba59d0c31c6cde6,Ocean Engineering,2024
Longitudinal dynamic envelope solution and transition path optimization based on reachability analysis for fixed-wing VTOL UAVs,"Flight velocity and tilt angle are commonly employed to define the safe region for fixed-wing vertical take-off and landing (FW-VTOL) UAVs as they undergo tilting, referred to as the transition corridor. Nevertheless, the transition corridor only considers the aircraft's limitations in a quasi-stationary condition and ignores the additional constraints introduced by the aircraft's kinematic behavior. To obtain a more accurate safe state space, the concept of the dynamic envelope was proposed by previous researchers. The dynamic envelope of UAV represents the safe state space taking into account aerodynamic constraints and kinematic constraints. Solving the dynamic envelope has consistently remained a focal point of research in the field. This study introduces an innovative approach that employs reachability analysis to solve the dynamic envelope of the FW-VTOL UAV during the transition stage. Building upon this, it proposes a safety index for the transition path, optimized to determine the safest transition path. Subsequently, specific case studies verified the effectiveness of the solution process and optimization method. The designed optimal path enhances safety by 9.71% compared to the basic path, signifying its practical significance in mitigating risk during the transition stage of FW-VTOL UAVs. Furthermore, the attributes of the transition path are analyzed based on two aspects: (A) a comparison between the optimal transition path and the two-dimensional transition path with a constant angle of attack; (B) an examination of how key UAV design parameters influence the transition path's safety. Overall, the methodology and general rules proposed in this study provide a theoretical basis and technical support for improving the security of FW-VTOL UAVs in the transition stage. © 2024 Elsevier Masson SAS",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85196655882&doi=10.1016%2fj.ast.2024.109267&partnerID=40&md5=f9f87469020db84364ec1495cb3497d1,Aerospace Science and Technology,2024
Theory-data dual driven car following model in traffic flow mixed of AVs and HDVs,"To model the car following (CF) behavior of mixed traffic flow composed of autonomous vehicles (AVs) and human-driving vehicles (HDVs) in the future, this paper calibrated the lower control algorithm of AVs and proposed a model named theory-data dual driven stochastically generative adversarial networks (TDS-GAN) to describe the CF behavior of HDVs based on experimental data from mixed traffic flow. Firstly, the experimental scenario and collected data were introduced. Secondly, two transfer functions for the lower control algorithm of AVs were compared. Then, to account for the stochasticity of HDVs, the idea of physics-informed deep learning (PIDL) was used to improve generative adversarial networks (GAN) and integrate it with two-dimensional intelligent driver model (2D-IDM). Finally, the effectiveness of the model was verified from both a micro prediction and a macro simulation perspective. The influence of AVs on the stability of mixed traffic flow at different Market Penetration Rate (MPR) was also observed. The results show that TDS-GAN can effectively describe the following behavior and stochasticity of HDVs. When combined with CF model of AVs, it can depict the evolution of mixed traffic flow more accurately. Additionally, AVs can improve traffic flow stability under different penetration rates, and the effect is more significant with higher MPR. However, the introduction of AVs may not necessarily be positive in terms of road capacity. © 2024 Elsevier Ltd",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85198015891&doi=10.1016%2fj.trc.2024.104747&partnerID=40&md5=6b67d6e368fcb943eec4b8e019b04098,Transportation Research Part C: Emerging Technologies,2024
Finite-time fuzzy cooperative control for multi-AUV systems under cyber-attacks with hybrid unknown nonlinearities,"In this paper, we investigate the fuzzy cooperative control and collision-free problems of discrete-time multiple autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs) systems subject to unknown nonlinearities and constrained communication under cyber-attacks. A cooperative controller composed of three components is proposed for each AUV follower. The first component maneuvers the position and velocity for tracking desired signals by the feedback information. The repulsion part protects the AUV from collision with environmental obstacles or other vehicles. The remaining nonlinearities compensation term is employed to compensate for the system's nonlinearities. Notably, the fuzzy logic systems (FLSs) approximate the hybrid unknown term constituted by external disturbances, unmodeled dynamics and deceptive signals. Then, the unknown terms identification and cooperative control problems are transformed into an error system stability problem. Inequality conditions for finite-time bounded error signals are presented through stability analysis. Also, it is theoretically proven that the cooperative control objective with collision avoidance can be accomplished by using suitable controller parameters. Lastly, the simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness of the complete control framework. Comparisons of various scenarios also affirm the significance of the FLSs and repulsion control for the multi-AUV cooperative control system. © 2024 Elsevier Ltd",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85190306401&doi=10.1016%2fj.oceaneng.2024.117875&partnerID=40&md5=08693edfc2272deb4fe3f15fca55133f,Ocean Engineering,2024
Periodic event-triggered adaptive neural control of USVs under replay attacks,"This work aims to address the control issue of unmanned surface vehicles (USVs) under replay attacks, where the influence of internal/external uncertainties and actuator's physical constraints are taken into account. In the control design, a hyperbolic tangent function is used to replace the actuator saturation nonlinearity. To solve the design problem of mismatched unknown time-varying control gain caused by replay attacks, the single-parameter-learning technique is introduced, which avoids the operation of estimating for the unknown gain directly. To compensate for the effect of lumped uncertainties including attacks, unknown dynamics and external disturbances, the adaptive neural network with the finite covering principle is involved in the kinematic and dynamic channels, respectively. Furthermore, to reduce the update rate of actuator and alleviate the actuator wear, a periodic event-triggering mechanism (PETM) is established in the controller-actuator (C-A) channel. Finally, a periodic event-triggered (PET) adaptive neural tracking control solution for USVs under replay attacks is proposed, and it is verified that the control solution can force the trajectory of USVs to follow the reference trajectory even if there exists the effect of replay attacks. In addition, all signals in the closed-loop control system of USVs under replay attacks are bounded, and simulation and comparison results demonstrate the effectiveness of the control strategy. © 2024",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85192092987&doi=10.1016%2fj.oceaneng.2024.118022&partnerID=40&md5=3b4ac64ad9f72b4477d0e16768765438,Ocean Engineering,2024
M4SFWD: A Multi-Faceted synthetic dataset for remote sensing forest wildfires detection,"Forest wildfires are one of the most catastrophic natural disasters, which poses a severe threat to both the ecosystem and human life. Therefore, it is imperative to implement technology to prevent and control forest wildfires. The combination of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) and object detection algorithms provides a quick and accurate method to monitor large-scale forest areas. Nevertheless, most available datasets on forest wildfires comprise single-mode ground-fixed-angle pictures that inadequately represent the intricate terrain, high humidity, low visibility meteorological conditions, and multiscale light flux densities of forest wildfires. To address these limitations, we developed the Multiple scenarios, Multiple weather conditions, Multiple lighting levels and Multiple wildfire objects Synthetic Forest Wildfire Dataset (M4SFWD), which provides remote sensing data on forest fires across diverse terrain types, weather conditions, light flux densities as well as different numbers of wildfire objects. Researchers can employ this dataset to improve the efficacy of fire and smoke detection algorithms, promoting continuous forest monitoring. This paper presents a Multi-Faceted Synthetic Forest Wildfire Dataset based on Unreal Engine 5. We first constructed eight forest scenes with different terrains, weather conditions, and texture effects. We also simulated the light flux density at different times of the day by utilizing real-time ray tracing technology, which created realistic lighting and shadows. Secondly, we introduced a range of wildfire targets with varying scales and numbers into each scenario to enable multiple-angle shooting simulations from a UAV's viewpoint. During evening hours and in foggy conditions, many objects resemble wildfires. To enhance the dataset's precision and reliability for fire and smoke detection, 3,974 images were undergone pixel-level manual annotation using tools like labelImg. This annotation yielded 17,763 bounding boxes, which were subsequently statistically analyzed to ascertain their positions and proportions. Finally, we assessed the applicability of M4SFWD in single-stage, two-stage, and lightweight object detection algorithms by inputting the dataset into various algorithms with different parameter sizes. Based on the experimental results’ visualization, M4SFWD exhibited superior performance in scenarios with standard light flux density and large-scale wildfire objects. However, due to its complex contextual information and multiscale object features, false detections and missed detections occurred in other complex multi-faceted scenarios. Thus, optimizing the existing object detection algorithms will be necessary for future research.

Progressive virtual risk-based vehicle trajectory optimization in mixed traffic flow,"Ramp-merging zones have perennially served as bottlenecks for both safety and efficiency within road traffic. Addressing the inherent uncertainties and anomalous behaviors potentially exhibited by human-driven vehicles (HDVs) in mixed traffic flow, this study introduced a distributed merging control algorithm based on virtual risk assessment. Initially, we proposed a progressive vehicle projection method based on matching degree, formulated to engender smooth longitudinal accelerations. Building upon this foundation, a virtual risk-based longitudinal planning model named V-RQM was established, furnishing longitudinal accelerations with robust stability and safety to Connected and Autonomous Vehicles (CAVs). Results from four diverse simulation experiments corroborate that V-RQM is aptly versatile, suited for conventional one-dimensional car-following environments as well as pre-merging control in heterogeneous traffic flow. The model not only mitigates oscillatory amplitudes while sustaining high traffic efficiency but also exhibits commendable resilience against uncertainties and anomalies indigenous to mixed traffic flow. This research pioneers a novel model-driven approach to ramp-merging control, setting the stage for the full exploitation of CAV capabilities. © 2024 Elsevier Ltd",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85195395684&doi=10.1016%2fj.trc.2024.104701&partnerID=40&md5=13e56882cf54d98cd04f10accb6e0f65,Transportation Research Part C: Emerging Technologies,2024
Robust adaptive model-free depth tracking control of under-actuated LAUV with experimental results,"In this study a robust adaptive model-free depth tracking control scheme for the under-actuated lightweight autonomous underwater vehicle (LAUV) with guidance compensation and disturbance rejection, is presented. The proposed scheme includes a double-layer architecture including a kinematic guidance layer and a dynamic control layer. On the kinematic layer, the adaptive line-of-sight guidance with angle of attack compensation is employed to convert depth error into pitch error to address the under-actuated control issue. Additionally, a tracking differentiator is implemented to adjust the desired input parameters and to improve transient performance. On the kinetic layer, an improved model-free adaptive tracking algorithm based on I/O data-driven approaches is provided. The mathematical model is replaced by an approximate data model derived through dynamic linearization. In the proposed tracking scheme, an extended state observer in discrete time form is also incorporated to predict and compensate higher-order unmodeled dynamics and external disturbances. The proposed scheme has been validated through experimental results obtained from LAUV underwater maneuvering tests conducted in a towing tank. These results validate the algorithm's superiority and efficacy in achieving depth tracking control of LAUV, particularly in less accurate, complex and challenging modeling scenarios. © 2024 Elsevier Ltd",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85192499953&doi=10.1016%2fj.oceaneng.2024.117989&partnerID=40&md5=dabf7b078e575036395a970bf4b67ffa,Ocean Engineering,2024
Energy efficient coverage path planning for USV-assisted inland bathymetry under current effects: An analysis on sweep direction,"Effective coverage path planning for USVs is essential to optimize the performance of bathymetric surveys. Traditionally, it is well recognized that the best sweep direction for coverage path planning is the parallel direction that finds the minimum span of the region of interest (ROI). However, the results in this paper first reveals that it is not always the case when the water current is involved. In this paper, we first formulate an energy consumption estimation model for USV and introduce a novel coverage path planning strategy. Then, we investigate the relationship between sweep direction and USV energy consumption under the influence of water currents, referred to as the E-β curve. We then systematically analyze the variations of the E-β curve under different shapes of ROIs, various water current attacking angles, and different coverage strategies. Finally, the model is extended to more realistic scenarios involving non-convex ROIs. The practicality of the model is validated USV semi-physical model. The results indicate that, under water currents, our proposed model allows for an optimal sweep direction that minimizes the energy consumption of USVs. This contrasts with traditional methods, which fail to achieve the optimal energy cost. The results hold significant implications for the design of USV mapping strategies in inland river. © 2024 Elsevier Ltd",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85190884553&doi=10.1016%2fj.oceaneng.2024.117910&partnerID=40&md5=6a52fe9ae24db27e846ffe667647cbf7,Ocean Engineering,2024

In particular, this study formulates a mixed-integer linear programming model and introduces a novel discrete variant of the moth-flame optimization (MFO) algorithm, named DMFO, to address the scheduling problem. The DMFO algorithm incorporates several significant enhancements. Firstly, a population initialization method is proposed, which combines a nearest-neighbor-based adaptive heuristic and a random sorting technique to ensure the formation of a well-structured population. Secondly, the flame generation mechanism and spiral flight search processes within the MFO have been redefined to achieve a more optimal balance between exploration and exploitation. A neighborhood search mechanism is subsequently devised, employing the concept of neighborhood relevance to accelerate the convergence process. Additionally, a heuristic approach is introduced to reduce the computational cost. Moreover, a population regeneration mechanism is proposed to avoid the algorithm falling into a local optimum. To validate the effectiveness of the DMFO, a comparative analysis is conducted using a dataset of 110 real-world factory instances. In this analysis, eight well-established optimization algorithms are employed. The simulation results consistently demonstrate that the relative percentage deviation (RPD) value of the DMFO tends to approach 0% more closely compared to other algorithms, thereby substantiating the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm. © 2024 Elsevier B.V.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85196560860&doi=10.1016%2fj.asoc.2024.111846&partnerID=40&md5=34578e850114019a6cbff04726b7e36a,Applied Soft Computing,2024
Real-time lightweight drone detection model: Fine-grained Identification of four types of drones based on an improved Yolov7 model,"Recently, the rapid progress of artificial intelligence has enhanced the human-robot relationship through the development of several autonomous robots; such as drones. The overwhelming rise of drones has brought both relevant advantages and threatening risks into our daily lives. They are strongly deployed to achieve hard tasks and reach critical areas within a short period of time. In the past few years, drones' anarchic and malicious use has generated many incidents and accidents, causing far-reaching impacts. Due to their dual-edged nature, they are regarded as potential threats. Recognizing the type of flying drones represents a challenging task for anti-drone systems to reinforce airspace safety and security. To this end, we propose a novel lightweight model able to differentiate between the main types of drones in real-time using appropriate modules. To find the optimal compromise between size, performance and speed, a lightweight model is proposed based on Yolov7 with the incorporation of CNeB and C3C2 modules as well as the Re- Parameterization Decoupled (RePD) head structure. Further, a CNeB module is used to reduce the model's size and improve the model's performance, a C3C2 module to enhance the feature extraction and fusion and a Re- Parameterization Decoupled RePD to improve both the efficacy and accuracy of the prediction part while reducing the inference time. The experimental results show that the Yolov7-CNeB-C3C2-RePD meets the anti-drone requirements by improving the detection performance, minimizing the inference speed and reducing the model size. In comparison to other models, the developed has provided high results reaching 91.9% precision, 90.5% recall, 95% mAP@0.5, and 20.3 ms during the inference stage, which outperforms the other algorithms in the benchmark. Furthermore, the model has an average detection speed of 0.003 ms per image and a capacity to process 27.88 frames per second, thus satisfying the real-time requirements. © 2024 Elsevier B.V.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85195059302&doi=10.1016%2fj.neucom.2024.127941&partnerID=40&md5=7a04ab3ab690d294cd5d22ea7d3c0d88,Neurocomputing,2024
A hyper-heuristic with deep Q-network for the multi-objective unmanned surface vehicles scheduling problem,"This paper proposes a learning-based hyper-heuristic algorithm for the coverage path planning problem of multiple unmanned surface vehicles (USV). The makespan and coverage of the USVs are considered simultaneously. The proposed method does not need to specify the location of the mapping task points in advance; instead, the task allocation and path planning can be realized only based on the parameter information of the USV and the watershed. Considering the uncertainty in the actual mapping process, the triangular fuzzy numbers are used to represent the mapping time and mapping radius of USVs. In order to solve the multi-USV scheduling problem efficiently, this paper proposes an NSGA-II based on dueling double deep Q-network called NSGA-II-DQN. NSGA-II-DQN integrates ten effective global search operators and five local search operators, which can achieve a good balance between exploration and exploitation. Experiment results in various scenarios demonstrate that NSGA-II-DQN can efficiently search for travel paths covering the entire water area for multiple USVs in a short planning time. © 2024 Elsevier B.V.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85194872779&doi=10.1016%2fj.neucom.2024.127943&partnerID=40&md5=680a503ba3d4935d83551775d1e8b83a,Neurocomputing,2024
Covariance matrix adaptation evolution strategy based on ensemble of mutations for parking navigation and maneuver of autonomous vehicles,"Previous works have demonstrated the use of human-inspired frameworks to address autonomous vehicle parking. In such frameworks, autonomous vehicle parking is formulated as a two-stage optimization problem where the first stage involves the generation of initial waypoints which are consequently used to reduce the autonomous parking task into a local motion planning task. In the second stage, the local motion planning is solved as a classical optimization problem. However, the overall algorithmic performance in the second stage depends on the planning horizon used to formulate the local planning task. In this work, we show first that the state-of-the-art algorithms often employed in the second stage fail with an increase in the planning horizon. Motivated by the need for algorithms that are scalable to different planning horizons, this work proposes Covariance Matrix Adaptation Evolution Strategy (CMA-ES) with an ensemble of mutations for the second stage. Specifically, the proposed algorithm features an ensemble of Gaussian- and Cauchy-based mutations to facilitate an efficient blend of both exploitation and exploration that is crucial for both short and long horizons. Furthermore, to handle the associated constraints, Superiority of Feasible (SF) constraint handling technique is incorporated into the proposed algorithm. Performance analysis based on 24 parking missions conducted with planning horizons of 2 and 4 shows that the proposed algorithm is scalable to different planning horizons compared with three commonly employed state-of-the-art algorithms. © 2024 Elsevier Ltd",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85186487096&doi=10.1016%2fj.eswa.2024.123565&partnerID=40&md5=9ebb5fd2beac85813e447ef3a087c398,Expert Systems with Applications,2024
A novel Q-learning-based secure routing scheme with a robust defensive system against wormhole attacks in flying ad hoc networks,"Nowadays, unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) organized in a flying ad hoc network (FANET) can successfully carry out complex missions. Due to the limitations of these networks, including the lack of infrastructure, wireless communication channels, dynamic topology, and unreliable communication between UAVs, cyberattacks, especially wormholes, weaken the performance of routing schemes. Therefore, maintaining communication security and guaranteeing the quality of service (QoS) are very challenging. In this paper, a novel Q-learning-based secure routing scheme (QSR) is presented for FANETs. QSR seeks to provide a robust defensive system against wormhole attacks, especially wormhole through encapsulation and wormhole through packet relay. QSR includes a secure neighbor discovery process and a Q-learning-based secure routing process. Firstly, each UAV gets information about its neighboring UAVs securely. To secure communication in this process, a local monitoring system is designed to counteract the wormhole attack through packet relay. This system checks data packets exchanged between neighboring UAVs and defines three rules according to the behavior of wormholes. In the second process, UAVs perform a distributed Q-learning-based routing process to counteract the wormhole attack through encapsulation. To reward the safest paths, a reward function is introduced based on five factors, the average one-hop delay, hop count, data loss ratio, packet transmission frequency (PTF), and packet reception frequency (PRF). Finally, the NS2 simulator is applied for implementing QSR and executing different scenarios. The evaluation results show that QSR works better than TOPCM, MNRiRIP, and MNDA in terms of accuracy, malicious node detection rate, data delivery ratio, and data loss ratio. However, it has more delay than TOPCM. © 2024 Elsevier Inc.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85198201165&doi=10.1016%2fj.vehcom.2024.100826&partnerID=40&md5=ec002a72f46f48208a99ddf1d0ecfa6c,Vehicular Communications,2024
Dynamic event-triggered time-varying formation control for heterogeneous unmanned swarm systems with scaling attacks,"This paper addresses the problem of time-varying formation control for heterogeneous unmanned swarm systems (USSs) consisting of multiple unmanned aerial vehicles (UASs) and unmanned surface vehicles (USVs) based on a directional switching topology. Firstly, a novel USSs model is established, involving the effect of multiple network attacks, network bandwidth constraints and input saturation. In particular, a scaling attack model is proposed to account for denial-of-service (DoS) and deception attacks. Secondly, a distributed controller based on a dynamic event triggering mechanism is designed to reduce the communication load by adjusting the communication frequency between individuals, and the Zeno phenomenon is effectively avoided. Finally, the Lyapunov function is used to obtain sufficient conditions for system stability and bounds on the frequency and duration of network attacks. The experiments and comparison results verify the proposed strategy's effectiveness and superiority. © 2024 Elsevier Ltd",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85198521850&doi=10.1016%2fj.oceaneng.2024.118727&partnerID=40&md5=fddcb65c842354c623cef855cff38415,Ocean Engineering,2024
AUV path planning in a three-dimensional marine environment based on a novel multiple swarm co-evolutionary algorithm,"Autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs) are rapidly advancing in ocean exploration. High-performance path planning techniques are essential for AUVs. Path planning for AUVs is a multi-faceted challenge, necessitating careful consideration of safety, energy consumption and the influence of sea currents to ensure the development of a high-quality trajectory that satisfies all operational criteria. Existing path planning algorithms have problems such as incomplete consideration of influencing factors, computational complexity and weak applicability. Therefore, we propose a swarm intelligence optimisation algorithm based on multiple swarm co-evolution (MCO) to address the issue of AUV path planning in a three-dimensional marine environment. First, a three-dimensional marine environment model and the corresponding path evaluation mechanism are established. Second, the MCO rule is established to ensure that the MCO has balanced exploration and exploitation capabilities. A shared dynamic optimal particle between populations is introduced to ensure information exchange between populations. In addition, the cross-integration mutation strategy has been proposed for promoting the fusion of two populations of superior genes to ensure the inheritance of superior paternal genes to the offspring. Finally, four comparison experiments are designed, and the experiments compare eight commonly used intelligent search algorithms and improved versions. The results of the experiments proved that the MCO has excellent three-dimensional marine environment path planning capability, with robustness and search capabilities superior to other swarm intelligence optimisation algorithms. © 2024 Elsevier B.V.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85198017557&doi=10.1016%2fj.asoc.2024.111933&partnerID=40&md5=06acd886f21f78692d428bff13c21448,Applied Soft Computing,2024
Cooperative lane-changing for connected autonomous vehicles merging into dedicated lanes in mixed traffic flow,"Connected and automated vehicles (CAVs) have enormous potential to enhance traffic safety, efficiency, and emissions reduction. However, in the initial phases of CAV development, mixed traffic comprising CAVs and human-driven vehicles (HDVs) will inevitably coexist in the traffic system. To fully exploit the benefits of CAVs, dedicated lanes with independent rights of way will be established. This paper proposes an optimal control strategy for coordinating the mandatory lane-changing of CAVs from ordinary lanes to dedicated lanes. The strategy develops a centralized two-stage cooperative optimal control model to optimize the lane-changing sequence and trajectories of CAVs. In the first stage, a dynamic programming formulation is designed to determine the lane-changing sequence decisions. The model predictive control (MPC) controller is adopted to dynamically solve the optimal control problem with a fixed terminal state. In the second stage, we dynamically and cooperatively designed the longitudinal trajectories of related CAVs. The lateral trajectories of lane-changing CAVs are planned with a cubic polynomial. The objective function considers driving comfort and state tracking to ensure traffic smoothness. Simulation results show that: (1) the proposed strategy can improve the negative impact of lane-changing behavior under different traffic demand levels. (2) Compared to the benchmark approach, the proposed strategy can significantly enhance traffic efficiency and driving comfort, particularly in medium-traffic demand. The strategy can improve the average speed of CAVs by approximately 12 % and decrease the average acceleration by over 45 %. (3) The average fuel consumption is positively correlated with traffic demands and the difference in arrival speeds between lane-changing and dedicated lane CAVs. (4) The effectiveness of the strategy increases with the length of the lane-changing segment. However, the marginal benefit becomes negligible when the segment exceeds 300 m. Therefore, the findings of this paper can provide theoretical support for the cooperative control of CAVs in dedicated lanes of highways in the future. © 2024 Elsevier Ltd",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85192342178&doi=10.1016%2fj.eswa.2024.124163&partnerID=40&md5=7c8d0d8646c5a51655cf8075f2fc50de,Expert Systems with Applications,2024
A Q-learning based iterated local search algorithm for human-UAV cooperation in restoring transmission network,"The power transmission network is easily to be destroyed when natural or man-made disasters occur. Restoration of power supply under disaster environments faces difficulties since a large-scale network typically contains many uninspected faulty nodes. Utilizing unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) to inspect these unknown faulty nodes can significantly improve the efficiency for subsequent restoration work performed by human-teams. Nevertheless, efficient cooperation of UAV and human-team is a complicated work due to the complexity of network structure and correlation between UAV scheduling and human-team scheduling. In this paper, a mathematical model is established to describe the considered problem aiming at maximizing the restored power supply in a limited response time. Then a Q-learning based iterated local search (Q ILS) algorithm is proposed to formulate the collaborative scheduling problem. Firstly, an initialization method is designed to assign UAVs for inspecting unknown faulty nodes and human-teams for repairing faulty nodes, which ensures each unknown faulty node is inspected before maintenance. Secondly, searching operators including perturbation and local search procedures are designed to ensure exploration and exploitation capability. Thirdly, Q-learning method is utilized as a learning engine to guide the direction of solution evolution. Moreover, the parameters of Q ILS are calibrated by multi-factor analysis of variance method to determine proper values. The computational simulations and comparison experiments validate the superiority of proposed algorithm. © 2024 Elsevier Ltd",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85193582772&doi=10.1016%2fj.eswa.2024.124200&partnerID=40&md5=9a5ef425778b14c53155b7642d6c996c,Expert Systems with Applications,2024
Memory-based event-triggered path-following control for a USV in the presence of DoS attack,"This paper proposes a novel memory-based event-triggered path-following controller for unmanned surface vehicles (USVs) in the presence of denial of service (DoS) attacks and limited communication resources. In the guidance part, a double distance logical virtual ship (DDLVS) guidance law is developed to eliminate the accumulation error of the yaw angle velocity in the traditional LVS algorithm, and the USV will keep a smoother tracking performance for the curve reference path. In the control part, the memory-based event-triggered fusion control algorithm proposed in this paper incorporates the signal non-transmission phenomenon caused by DoS attacks into the event-triggered interval through a set of adaptive parameters. Consequently, the adverse affect caused by DoS attacks is solved in the process of designing the event-triggered control law. By combining the neural networks (NNs) and the dynamic surface control (DSC) techniques, the updating weights are significantly compressed. The proposed algorithm is with advantages of concise controller structure, low energy cost, and easy engineering implementation. All the error signals of the closed-loop system are proved to be semi-global uniform ultimate bound (SGUUB) by the Lyapunov analyses. Finally, through two numerical examples, including the comparative simulation and path following maneuver in Shuang island (an island distribute in Liaoning Dalian), are provided to verify the effectiveness of the proposed strategy. © 2024 Elsevier Ltd",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85197771197&doi=10.1016%2fj.oceaneng.2024.118627&partnerID=40&md5=7cee5e9738a5b348ae35f8eb05ce661d,Ocean Engineering,2024
A robust multi-stage intrusion detection system for in-vehicle network security using hierarchical federated learning,"As connected and autonomous vehicles proliferate, the Controller Area Network (CAN) bus has become the predominant communication standard for in-vehicle networks due to its speed and efficiency. However, the CAN bus lacks basic security measures such as authentication and encryption, making it highly vulnerable to cyberattacks. To ensure in-vehicle security, intrusion detection systems (IDSs) must detect seen attacks and provide a robust defense against new, unseen attacks while remaining lightweight for practical deployment. Previous work has relied solely on the CAN ID feature or has used traditional machine learning (ML) approaches with manual feature extraction. These approaches overlook other exploitable features, making it challenging to adapt to new unseen attack variants and compromising security. This paper introduces a cutting-edge, novel, lightweight, in-vehicle, IDS-leveraging, deep learning (DL) algorithm to address these limitations. The proposed IDS employs a multi-stage approach: an artificial neural network (ANN) in the first stage to detect seen attacks, and a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) autoencoder in the second stage to detect new, unseen attacks. To understand and analyze diverse driving behaviors, update the model with the latest attack patterns, and preserve data privacy, we propose a theoretical framework to deploy our IDS in a hierarchical federated learning (H-FL) environment. Experimental results demonstrate that our IDS achieves an F1-score exceeding 0.99 for seen attacks and exceeding 0.95 for novel attacks, with a detection rate of 99.99%. Additionally, the false alarm rate (FAR) is exceptionally low at 0.016%, minimizing false alarms. Despite using DL algorithms known for their effectiveness in identifying sophisticated and zero-day attacks, the IDS remains lightweight, ensuring its feasibility for real-world deployment. This makes our model robust against seen and unseen attacks. © 2024 The Author(s)",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85202843899&doi=10.1016%2fj.vehcom.2024.100837&partnerID=40&md5=96218c3e3bf89e409a0f219467818ea4,Vehicular Communications,2024
Risk assessment of maritime autonomous surface ships collisions using an FTA-FBN model,"Maritime autonomous surface ships (MASS), presenting the future of maritime transport, are attracting increasing attention from the international maritime community. The collision risk analysis of MASS reveals unsolved challenges, which without appropriate solutions, will result in the error prone development of the relevant risk control measures and policies. Among the challenges, two significant ones in the existing literature are the lack of historical failure data to realise quantitative risk assessment, and 2) the complex causal relationship among the relevant risk factors. This paper aims to develop a new Fault Tree Analysis-Fuzzy Bayesian Network (FTA-FBN) model to conduct the collision risk assessment of MASS with uncertainty in data. First, it establishes a causal relationship among the risk factors through an FTA. Secondly, mapping the obtained FTA diagram into a BN allows fault diagnosis and the identification of the most important factors influencing MASS collisions. In this process, a survey is conducted to collect the primary data for configuring the conditional probabilities of the relevant influential factors and quantifying the developed BN for risk diagnosis and prediction. Finally, the new model is verified by using sensitivity analysis and three axioms and then applied to conduct scenario-based risk prediction and diagnosis to generate insightful findings to guide MASS navigation safety. The results demonstrate that the FTA-FBN model realizes the simplification of the expert scoring process, reduces computational complexity, and addresses the challenge of constructing causal relationships between MASS collisions and their risk factors due to the scarcity of historical accident data. Additionally, the BN backward reasoning identifies key collision risks, including external physical attacks, inadequate training of shore-based operators, insufficient maintenance of ship equipment and systems, and cyber-security threats. The new model when being adapted, can provide a reference for the formulation of safe navigation policies and provide important insights for shipping companies to ensure the safe navigation of their ships and shipbuilders to optimise ship design. © 2024 The Authors",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85196709890&doi=10.1016%2fj.oceaneng.2024.118444&partnerID=40&md5=9a3d50fe5878443634b1e5cd26cbf2ae,Ocean Engineering,2024
Real-time fusion multi-tier DNN-based collaborative IDPS with complementary features for secure UAV-enabled 6G networks,"UAV-enabled Integrated Sensing and Communication (ISAC) in sixth-generation (6G) wireless networks has sparked significant research interest. UAVs are positioned as aerial wireless platforms, extending coverage and improving Sensing and Communication (S&C) services. However, integrating UAVs introduces vulnerabilities due to multi-connectivity, necessitating robust security measures. To address this, efforts are focused on developing effective Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS). Here ML-based IDSs depend on the most suited Machine Learning (ML) algorithms for improved detection accuracy. However, inadequate detection features frequently contribute to the limitations of detection accuracy in various emerging cyber-attacks. Our study explores attack traits in UAV-enabled 6G networks, using complementary detection features to enhance ML-based attack detection. Additionally, existing Deep Neural Network (DNN) solutions for UAVs-enabled 6G networks mainly use single models (e.g., CNN, SVM, CGAN) instead of multi-tier models, (e.g., Hybrid, Fusion, Ensemble). Here, although the use of a single model can be faster for computer systems, it is difficult to understand the growing complexity of intrusion patterns in data. Also, these single models might not be good at recognizing the unique patterns of less common issues in datasets. Thus, we propose a fusion multi-tier DNN-based Collaborative Intrusion Detection and Prevention System (CIDPS) for critical UAV-enabled 6G networks. This system boosts accuracy without sacrificing latency reductions. Our approach learns decision boundaries from imbalanced data points using preceding DNNs sequentially. Moreover, most existing research works do not focus on intrusion prevention methods and deployment frameworks for UAV networks. This research proposes effective IPS mechanisms and deployment architecture for CIDPS in UAV-enabled 6G networks. It incorporates a CIDPS with an emergency response protocol, neutralizing attacks upon anomaly detection. We validate our solution through diverse dataset experiments (UAVIDS-2020, NF-UQ-NIDS-v2, 5G-NIDD). Unlike traditional practices where IDS are simulated, we implement CIDPS on actual UAV devices (PX4 Vision Dev Kit V1.5, DJI mini se, DJI mini 3 pro) and real-world UAV networks. Our approach outperforms prior algorithms with a 99.25% attack classification accuracy, higher detection efficiency, and lower resource usage, exceeding 99.05% detection rates. © 2024 Elsevier Ltd",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85193462878&doi=10.1016%2fj.eswa.2024.124215&partnerID=40&md5=3151ec9dc6d9f558259e88ef9708dad8,Expert Systems with Applications,2024
UAV air combat autonomous trajectory planning method based on robust adversarial reinforcement learning,"The poor robustness of the air combat autonomous trajectory planning strategy (ATP) trained through vanilla reinforcement learning (RL) methods is attributed to its dependence on the source environment. When this ATP is transformed from the source to the target environment, it may fail to lead to an effective dogfight victory due to disturbances, which can potentially threaten the flight safety of the unmanned combat aerial vehicle (UCAV). In order to enhance the robustness of ATP, we propose a robust RL-based method for generating an ATP strategy. This method can effectively consider uncertainties in the state and potential model misspecifications. First, a jointly trained adversary is designed to apply disturbances in the environment, forming a two-player zero-sum game with the ATP agent. To solve this game problem and learn a robust ATP, the robust adversarial RL method (RARL) is applied. Additionally, in order to prevent non-convergence of strategies resulting from the introduction of the RARL algorithm, a curriculum learning method is proposed that emulates the way human pilots learn, gradually progressing from simpler to more challenging courses. Finally, a quantitative method for evaluating the robustness of the ATP is proposed, taking into consideration the differences in ATP performance between the source and target combat environments. The results of robustness estimations demonstrate that the RARL algorithm, which is proposed herein, effectively enhances the ATP's robustness. © 2024 Elsevier Masson SAS",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85199763574&doi=10.1016%2fj.ast.2024.109402&partnerID=40&md5=86f6607b8a52594f44b3e0771d51a743,Aerospace Science and Technology,2024
REACT: Autonomous intrusion response system for intelligent vehicles,"Autonomous and connected vehicles are rapidly evolving, integrating numerous technologies and software. This progress, however, has made them appealing targets for cybersecurity attacks. As the risk of cyber threats escalates with this advancement, the focus is shifting from solely preventing these attacks to also mitigating their impact. Current solutions rely on vehicle security operation centers, where attack information is analyzed before deciding on a response strategy. However, this process can be time-consuming and faces scalability challenges, along with other issues stemming from vehicle connectivity. This paper proposes a dynamic intrusion response system integrated within the vehicle. This system enables the vehicle to respond to a variety of incidents almost instantly, thereby reducing the need for interaction with the vehicle security operation center. The system offers a comprehensive list of potential responses, a methodology for response evaluation, and various response selection methods. The proposed solution was implemented on an embedded platform. Two distinct cyberattack use cases served as the basis for evaluating the system. The evaluation highlights the system's adaptability, its ability to respond swiftly, its minimal memory footprint, and its capacity for dynamic system parameter adjustments. The proposed solution underscores the necessity and feasibility of incorporating dynamic response mechanisms in smart vehicles. This is a crucial factor in ensuring the safety and resilience of future smart mobility. © 2024 The Author(s)",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85199489024&doi=10.1016%2fj.cose.2024.104008&partnerID=40&md5=655a476dedafe94241c1ff86f3bf6f34,Computers and Security,2024
HCFAIUN: A novel hyperelliptic curve and fuzzy extractor-based authentication for secure data transmission in IoT-based UAV networks,"IoT-based UAV networks comprise interconnected UAVs outfitted with sensors and microcontrollers to simplify data exchange in environments such as smart cities. In light of open-access communication landscapes, IoT-based UAV networks could pose security challenges, encompassing authentication vulnerabilities and the inadvertent disclosure of location and other confidential information to unauthorised parties. Henceforth, we have proposed a lightweight and secure authentication protocol: Hyperelliptic Curve and Fuzzy Extractor based Authentication in IoT-based UAV networks (HCFAIUN) leveraging Hyperelliptic Curve Cryptography(HCC), Fuzzy Extractor (FE), XOR operations and hash functions. HCC's maximum key size is 80 bits, differing from the 160-bit requirement of the elliptic curve, making it apt for UAVs with limited resources. The proposed scheme utilises biometrics traits of users to avoid exposing data from stealing smart devices using FE. This protocol facilitates the mutual authentication of users and UAVs, allowing them to exchange a session key for secure communication. The Hyperelliptic Curve (HC) scalar multiplication protects the user's private key from attackers, even in public channels. The obfuscation identity of the user and UAVs generated through the hash function and timestamp makes the external user and UAV anonymous. The efficacy of this proposed framework is examined using the Scyther verification tool and Random oracle model-based formal analysis, and informal analysis is also discussed, which validates its robustness against well-known potential physical and logical attacks. The performance analysis shows that the HCFAIUN scheme has lower computation, communication, and storage costs, i.e., 3.832 ms and 1456 bits and 1128 bits, respectively, compared to existing schemes. © 2024 Elsevier Inc.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85200245086&doi=10.1016%2fj.vehcom.2024.100834&partnerID=40&md5=da31511749311c39b2800edfc311bd7f,Vehicular Communications,2024
Fusion flow-enhanced graph pooling residual networks for Unmanned Aerial Vehicles surveillance in day and night dual visions,"Recognizing unauthorized Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) within designated no-fly zones throughout the day and night is of paramount importance, where the unauthorized UAVs pose a substantial threat to both civil and military aviation safety. However, recognizing UAVs day and night with dual-vision cameras is nontrivial, since red–green–blue (RGB) images suffer from a low detection rate under an insufficient light condition, such as on cloudy or stormy days, while black-and-white infrared (IR) images struggle to capture UAVs that overlap with the background at night. In this paper, we propose a new optical flow-assisted graph-pooling residual network (OF-GPRN), which significantly enhances the UAV detection rate in day and night dual visions. The proposed OF-GPRN develops a new optical fusion to remove superfluous backgrounds, which improves RGB/IR imaging clarity. Furthermore, OF-GPRN extends optical fusion by incorporating a graph residual split attention network and a feature pyramid, which refines the perception of UAVs, leading to a higher success rate in UAV detection. A comprehensive performance evaluation is conducted using a benchmark UAV catch dataset. The results indicate that the proposed OF-GPRN elevates the UAV mean average precision (mAP) detection rate to 87.8%, marking a 17.9% advancement compared to the residual graph neural network (ResGCN)-based approach. © 2024 The Author(s)",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85198925089&doi=10.1016%2fj.engappai.2024.108959&partnerID=40&md5=c45c404ccee0d8a0171218216b51d303,Engineering Applications of Artificial Intelligence,2024
Controller design and remote piloting training module development for unmanned cropped delta reflex wing configuration,"In this study, a cost-effective high-fidelity six-degree of freedom module augmented with an onboard controller is developed. The unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) under consideration is a wing-alone configuration with a cropped delta planform and reflex airfoil cross-section designed to perform manoeuvres at high angles of attack. The six-degree of freedom dynamics for the aforementioned configuration is developed based on Newtonian mechanics incorporating linear and nonlinear aerodynamic models to expand flight simulations in corresponding regimes. Aerodynamic stability and control parameters for the simulations are obtained from full-scale wind tunnel measurements and flight tests. It is observed that the linear aerodynamic model is valid in angle of attack (α) domain −5°≤α≤10°, followed by nonlinearity up to α≈21°, post which lift coefficient remains almost constant with angle of attack till 45°. The simulation model is validated with the corresponding flight data obtained from flight tests. A user-friendly graphical interface with real-time animation of UAV has been developed for the aforementioned configuration by integrating MATLAB and Flightgear environment with real-time control input from the hardware to enable the pilot for visual and tactile feedback, respectively. A controller based on total energy control is designed for velocity and altitude hold modes, while an attitude hold controller is designed for pitch and roll angle tracking to enable controller-in-the-loop remote piloting simulations. In order to enhance practical applicability, the designed module has been tested under various simulated wind conditions. It is noticed from the results that the steady-state error in attitude remains below 2% with a maximum overshoot of 5° from reference. The total energy controller achieves a zero steady-state error with a maximum overshoot of 2 m/s for velocity and 6 m for altitude, respectively. The developed module enhances remote piloting training, flight response assessment, and control algorithm testing for cropped delta planform UAVs. © 2024",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85201456001&doi=10.1016%2fj.ast.2024.109472&partnerID=40&md5=e98092649c7d3af91b1791bf9462409a,Aerospace Science and Technology,2024
OSTIS: A novel Organization-Specific Threat Intelligence System,"With the increasing complexity and frequency of cyber attacks, organizations recognize the need for a proactive and targeted approach to safeguard their digital assets and operations. Every industry faces a distinct array of threats shaped by factors such as its industrial objective, geographic footprint, workforce size, revenue, partnerships, and the extent of its digital assets. This results in a wide heterogeneity in threat landscapes, which necessitates tailored threat intelligence sources. While some security practitioners may gravitate towards extensive sources, relying solely on volume-based solutions often leads to “alert fatigue”. For this reason, organization-specific threat intelligence has acquired a growing importance in cybersecurity defense. This work presents a complete and novel framework called OSTIS (Organization-Specific Threat Intelligence System) for generating and managing organization-specific Cyber Threat Intelligence (CTI) data. Our approach identifies reliable security blogs from which we gather CTI data through a custom and focused Web Crawler. Relevant content from such sources is, then, identified and extracted using automated deep-learning models. Moreover, our AI-driven solution maps CTI data to specific domain scenarios, such as education, finance, government, healthcare, industrial control systems, and IoT. To validate and gain insights from the trained models, we also include an explainable AI (XAI, for short) task carried out by leveraging the SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) tool. This allows us to interpret the prediction process and discern influential content from data. The last step of our framework consists of the generation of an Organization Specific Threat Intelligence Knowledge Graph (OSTIKG), empowering organizations to identify and visualize attack patterns and incidents, promptly. To create this graph, we develop and adapt several techniques to extract diverse entities, including malware groups, campaigns, attack types, malware types, software tools, and so forth, and to identify relationships among them. Finally, through an extensive experimental campaign, we certify the validity and performance of all the components of our framework, which shows a 0.84 F1-score in the identification of relevant content, a 0.93 F1-score for the domain classification, and a 0.95 and 0.89 F1-score in the identification of entities and relations to build our OSTIKG graph. © 2024 Elsevier Ltd",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85199489442&doi=10.1016%2fj.cose.2024.103990&partnerID=40&md5=024524cd1e29828cefe89895ccdc5930,Computers and Security,2024
Resilient automated intersection control of connected vehicles under denial of service attacks,"This paper addresses the issue of automated intersection control for connected vehicles in the presence of Denial-of-Service (DoS) attacks. DoS attacks can disrupt the vehicular communication network, leading to increased service time and additional transmission delays, thereby raising a risk of collisions at intersections. To mitigate this problem, we propose a resilient automated intersection control system that ensures safe passage of connected vehicles through non-signalized intersections. First, we establish a communication topology that captures the information transmission between vehicles using a vehicle conflict graph. This topology serves as the basis for designing a distributed control protocol that enables conflict-free cooperation at intersections, taking into account the stochastic delays caused by DoS attacks. To synthesize a resilient controller for the automated intersection control system, we employ the polytopic overapproximation technique based on the real Jordan form. This technique allows us to model the system dynamics and uncertainties, enabling the derivation of a set of sufficient conditions for system stability. By solving a series of linear matrix inequalities, we obtain the controller gains that satisfy these stability conditions. Numerical examples are presented to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed control method. © 2024 Elsevier Ltd",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85199374783&doi=10.1016%2fj.engappai.2024.108950&partnerID=40&md5=77d96db25fdb423901834df1bbdbd75d,Engineering Applications of Artificial Intelligence,2024
Modeling lane changes using parallel learning,"This paper introduces an innovative approach to model the lane-change (LC) process of vehicles by employing parallel learning, seamlessly integrating conventional physical or behavioral models with data-driven counterparts. The LC process is divided into two distinct steps: the LC decision and the LC implementation, each independently modeled. For the LC decision model, a utility-based model is embedded into a neural network. Simultaneously, the LC implementation model incorporates a conventional car-following model, replicating the behavior of the new follower of the lane-changer, within the training process of a long-short-term memory model. Empirical trajectory data collected from unmanned aerial vehicles, which provides detailed information on the vehicles’ lane-changing process, serves as the basis for training and testing the proposed models. Additionally, data from a different site is employed to assess model transferability. Results demonstrate that the proposed models adeptly predict both LC decisions and implementations, outperforming baseline physical and behavioral models, as well as pure data-driven models, in terms of prediction accuracy and transferability. These findings highlight the significant potential of these models in improving the precision of microscopic traffic simulators. © 2024 Elsevier Ltd",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85203011017&doi=10.1016%2fj.trc.2024.104841&partnerID=40&md5=b04f6681effbbbf886dd5bbd904d7ee9,Transportation Research Part C: Emerging Technologies,2024
Generative adversarial networks enable outlier detection and property monitoring for additive manufacturing of complex structures,"Although additive manufacturing processes have matured in many areas, difficulties with regard to printing accuracy persist. Possible defects are, e.g., the generation of unwanted internal pores or a lack of fusion between layers. In general, defects result in a deviation between as-planned and as-built geometries. Assessing the influence of such deviations on effective (mechanical) properties requires either experimental testing or numerical investigation, both of which are often too complex for being used in time-critical production settings. Previous work with the Finite Cell Method (FCM) has shown that image-based computational homogenization can assist in principle in quality monitoring of produced parts by providing effective mechanical properties of as-built geometries. However, conducting FCM computations online for each and every part of a series production demands a prohibitive amount of computational resources. The paper at hand suggests a remedy to this problem by using generative adversarial networks. This manuscript presents an integrated computational workflow for outlier detection and property monitoring, which in principle consists of four steps: (i) Carry out experiments under varying process conditions and collect respective (micro)-structural images. (ii) Compute effective properties for these images using FCM. (iii) Compose a generative adversarial network (GAN) training dataset from those images that meet desired effective properties. (iv) Use the GAN discriminator to detect outliers in series production. To this end, the discriminator is used as a classifier on as-built parts to judge whether an as-built structure is acceptable or defective. The viability of the approach is demonstrated on additively manufactured lattice structures whose geometry is acquired after production via computed tomography. The methodology is not only applicable for automated property monitoring but potentially also for reliability estimates of neural network-based property predictors. © 2024 The Author(s)",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85199862368&doi=10.1016%2fj.engappai.2024.108993&partnerID=40&md5=48601113569c83fe664eb07512247fef,Engineering Applications of Artificial Intelligence,2024
Fault-tolerant security-efficiency combined authentication scheme for manned-unmanned teaming,"Manned-unmanned teaming (MUM-T) is an emerging network system which interconnects manned aerial vehicles (MAVs) with unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) to enhance mission effectiveness and reduce workloads. Like other wireless systems, MUM-T is prone to attacks from the open communication channel. Therefore, an authentication scheme is required to establish secure and trusted communication between the MAV and the UAV. However, existing schemes fail to provide adequate security features and necessary efficiency, mostly due to their incomprehensive threat modeling and improper use of authentication techniques. Moreover, traditional centralized architecture of the authentication server leads to the single point of failure (SPOF) problem, which jeopardizes the robustness and scalability of MUM-T. In this paper, we propose a fault-tolerant authentication scheme for MUM-T that will solve these problems. To enhance its security, we construct a new threat model consisting of adversary's capabilities, security features, and security challenges to ensure the security of a scheme under combination attacks. To preserve the highest possible efficiency, we propose the design principle of using lightweight primitives for authentication and applying public key operations in key establishment. To address the SPOF problem, we employ a distributed fault-tolerant mechanism to share registration information within authentication servers and defend against faulty nodes. As is demonstrated by the security proof and performance comparison, our scheme succeeds in improving security and reducing overall costs, which provides a better solution than existing schemes. © 2024 Elsevier Ltd",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85201182883&doi=10.1016%2fj.cose.2024.104052&partnerID=40&md5=c2d6ea3e045e1b56f912795fd92a25ae,Computers and Security,2024
AquaFeL-PSO: An informative path planning for water resources monitoring using autonomous surface vehicles based on multi-modal PSO and federated learning,"The preservation, monitoring, and control of large water resources has been a major challenge in recent decades. To ensure the quality of water resources, it is necessary to constantly monitor pollution levels. To meet this objective, this paper proposes an informative path planning for water resource monitoring, namely the AquaFeL-PSO algorithm, which uses autonomous surface vehicles, equipped with water quality sensors, based on a multi-modal particle swarm optimization, and the federated learning technique, with Gaussian process as a surrogate model. The proposed informative path planning has two phases, the exploration phase and the exploitation phase. In the exploration phase, the vehicles examine the surface of the water resource, and with the data acquired by the water quality sensors, an initial water quality model is estimated in the central server. In the exploitation phase, the area is divided into action zones using the model estimated in the exploration phase for a better exploitation of the contamination zones. To obtain the final water quality model of the water resource, the models obtained in both phases are combined. The results demonstrate that the proposed AquaFeL-PSO path planner is 3% more efficient in obtaining water quality models of the action zones than other similar path planners compared in this article. Moreover, in this case study, the AquaFeL-PSO has been demonstrated to have 300% more efficiency in achieving a better model of the entire water resource, and approximately 4,000% improvement in detecting pollution peaks. The analysis of variance provides support for these results, demonstrating a significant difference between the means of the path planners in detecting pollution peaks and generating the water quality model of the entire surface of the water resource. It was also shown that the results obtained by applying the federated learning technique are very similar to that of a centralized system and it allows to obtain a model of the water resource even when the Gaussian process of an action zone does not converge. © 2024 Elsevier Ltd",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85199927969&doi=10.1016%2fj.oceaneng.2024.118787&partnerID=40&md5=fd7d8a66a6a5dbae8d5ab47c507ca8a8,Ocean Engineering,2024
Experimental investigation of the aerodynamics of a UAV inlet with double 90° bends,"Unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) inlets commonly have a compact S-shaped inlet structure for the sake of stealth. Most of the current studies on subsonic inlets have focused on S-shaped configurations with relatively gentle transitions of the flow channel. In this study, the aerodynamic performance and swirl flow characteristics of a UAV inlet, which has double 90° bends in the duct and is integrated with an aircraft fuselage and a volute, are studied both experimentally and numerically. The influences of angle of attack, sideslip angle, AIP (Aerodynamic Interface Plane) Mach number, and freestream airspeed are analyzed. A measure of adding two deflectors in front of the first bend and a baffle at the bottom of the volute is proposed to improve the total pressure distortion and swirl distortion characteristics of the inlet. Finally, a practice of shape optimization is performed to further improve the aerodynamic performance and swirl flow characteristics on the basis of the baseline configuration. The results indicate that the maximum and minimum total pressure recovery coefficients of the baseline inlet configuration are 0.982 and 0.969, respectively, as well as the maximum total pressure distortion index of –0.0814 and the maximum swirl distortion index of 32.1 % under normal operating conditions. Through a total of 8 iterations of optimization, the total pressure recovery coefficient is eventually improved by 0.21 % of that of the baseline configuration, as well as the total pressure distortion index, swirl distortion index and maximum swirl angle reduced by 43.6 %, 4.6 % and 11.1 %, respectively. © 2024 Elsevier Masson SAS",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85201874197&doi=10.1016%2fj.ast.2024.109502&partnerID=40&md5=97abe5550e27f2e467329edd3778d1ae,Aerospace Science and Technology,2024
Adopting artificial intelligence algorithms for remote fetal heart rate monitoring and classification using wearable fetal phonocardiography,"Fetal phonocardiography (FPCG) is a non-invasive Fetal Heart Rate (FHR) monitoring technique that can detect vibrations and murmurs in heart sounds. However, acquiring fetal heart sounds from a wearable FPCG device is challenging due to noise and artefacts. This research contributes a resilient solution to overcome the conventional issues by adopting Artificial Intelligence (AI) with FPCG for automated FHR monitoring in an end-to-end manner, named (AI-FHR). Four sequential methodologies were used to ensure reliable and accurate FHR monitoring. The proposed method removes low-frequency noises and high-frequency noises by using Chebyshev II high-pass filters and Enhanced Complete Ensemble Empirical Mode Decomposition with Adaptive Noise (ECEEMDAN) in combination with Phase Shifted Maximal Overlap Discrete Wavelet Transform (PS-MODWT) filters, respectively. The denoised signals are segmented to reduce complexity, and the segmentation is performed using multi-agent deep Q-learning (MA-DQL). The segmented signal is provided to reduce the redundancies in cardiac cycles using the Artificial Hummingbird Optimization (AHBO) algorithm. The segmented and non-redundant signals are converted into 3D spectrograms using a machine learning algorithm called variational auto-encoder-general adversarial networks (VAE-GAN). The feature extraction and classification are carried out by adopting a hybrid of the bidirectional gated recurrent unit (BiGRU) and the multi-boosted capsule network (MBCapsNet). The proposed method was implemented and simulated using MATLAB R2020a and validated by adopting effective validation metrics. The results demonstrate that the proposed method performed better than the current method with accuracy (81.34%), sensitivity (72%), F1-score (83%), Energy (0.808 J), and complexity index (13.34). Like other optimization methods, AHO needs precise parameter adjustment in order to function well. Its performance may be greatly impacted by the selection of parameters, including population size, exploration rate, and learning rate. © 2024 The Author(s)",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85200601163&doi=10.1016%2fj.asoc.2024.112049&partnerID=40&md5=1897a4617a6797fe76b40c780e6144b0,Applied Soft Computing,2024
A transfer learning model for cognitive electronic reconnaissance of unmanned aerial vehicle: Experiments,"Applying Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) technologies to Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) electronic reconnaissance is one of the current research hotspots. However, simulation and engineering practice show that due to poor generalization of DRL models, the performance of Cognitive Electronic Reconnaissance (CER) policies based on training will significantly decrease when the mission scene undergoes slight changes. To address this issue, we thoughtfully combine the mission area segmentation technique with transfer DRL and propose a difference-adaptive transfer DRL algorithm. This algorithm involves mission subarea segmentation, subarea pre-training, multi-subarea policy transfer, and multi-subarea splicing, providing an efficient solution to the convergence problem of the DRL algorithm caused by mission space expansion and reward sparsity. Additionally, a general CER transfer learning simulator is developed based on the analysis of the capabilities of the maneuvering platform and electronic reconnaissance payload. Multiple sets of CER policy transfer learning experiments are designed for different mission spaces, mission difficulties, and UAV characteristics. Compared with the algorithm baseline, our designed policy model significantly outperforms: the mission completion rate of UAVs in multi-scale mission spaces improves by up to 37.4%, reaching 97.5%, while the training time is reduced by 2.46 h. Further behavior analysis shows that this policy model enables UAVs to exhibit target tracking behaviors such as hovering and sustained approach. © 2024 Elsevier Ltd",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85201714928&doi=10.1016%2fj.engappai.2024.109158&partnerID=40&md5=8c1d1d7970b3d1f6484e8bd8e26b6cd1,Engineering Applications of Artificial Intelligence,2024

Hull shape optimization of autonomous underwater vehicles using a full turbulent continuous adjoint solver,"The present study aims at simultaneously optimizing the nose and tail of two distinct Autonomous Underwater Vehicles (AUVs) using a full turbulent continuous adjoint solver. The entire procedure is carried out utilizing two open-source software: Salome (CAD and mesh generator) and OpenFOAM v2206 (CFD solver and optimizer). Reynolds-Averaged Navier–Stokes (RANS) equations closed by the k-ω SST model are employed to simulate the turbulent flow around AUV hulls. Besides, adjointOptimisationFoam solver is used to perform the shape optimization. Two different unconstrained and constrained optimizations of AUV hulls are conducted at an angle of attack (α) equal to 0°. In the unconstrained optimization, the drag force is chosen as an objective function to be minimized while a partial volume is considered as a geometric constraint in the constrained optimization. The predicted drag force is validated against experimental results from the literature, indicating a mere 0.58% discrepancy. In the unconstrained optimizations, the first and second AUV hulls reveal a 4.17% and 3.66% reduction in the drag force, respectively. In the constrained optimizations of the first and second AUV hulls, drag force is reduced by 3.25% and 2.63%, respectively. © 2024 Elsevier Ltd",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85204462985&doi=10.1016%2fj.oceaneng.2024.119256&partnerID=40&md5=46d4b4b5900a0ab03bc600b5a0c05b87,Ocean Engineering,2024
Distributed-observer-based adaptive fault tolerant formation maneuver for autonomous surface vehicles under stochastic cyber-attack,"This paper investigates the distributed adaptive fault-tolerant formation maneuver control strategy for multiple autonomous surface vehicles (ASVs) systems subject to stochastic cyber-attack and actuator failures. Existing works have provided solutions against continuous attacks on communication channels while ignoring the increasingly prevalent intermittent attacks. Compared to the former, the latter are more challenging to detect, having been insufficiently described and addressed. Motivated by this observation, this article is concerned with the stochastic intermittent injection attacks, which are modeled as stochastic impulsive sequences, characterized by stochastic injection instant and intensity, leading to unpredictable changes in the state information transmitted by the neighbors. Taking this dilemma into consideration, a novel distributed observer is proposed, capable of effectively observing the target formation even in the presence of stochastic intermittent injection attacks. Meanwhile, a large feedback gain is incorporated into the observer to reduce the impact of attacks on system stability. A linear sliding manifold, together with the adaptive algorithm, is utilized to construct a fault tolerant control architecture for each follower ASV without employing model parameters which can confront the embarrassing scenario of actuator failures. Eventually, theoretical deduction and numerical simulations are conducted to confirm the feasibility of the proposed collaborative control scheme. © 2024 Elsevier Ltd",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85203640091&doi=10.1016%2fj.oceaneng.2024.119249&partnerID=40&md5=0eebf9ee412a28cbad32633efda6202e,Ocean Engineering,2024
Dynamics modeling and comparative analysis for underwater gliders considering different ranges of attack angle,"The underwater glider, which relies on buoyancy and attitude adjustments to achieve spatial motion, is an energy-saving observation platform for ocean phenomenon. Accurate dynamic models have important guiding significance for performance evaluation and controller design of the glider. This paper takes the Petrel glider as the research object, and establishes four types of dynamic models considering different ranges of attack angle, which has never been reported before. The model difference is mainly reflected in the viscous hydrodynamic equations obtained by using polynomials to fit computational fluid dynamics (CFD) simulation results. Then, some numerical cases are given to study the dynamics response difference of these models considering the ideal working condition and complex water current environments, respectively. The results indicate that there is not obvious dynamics response difference under the steady-state gliding condition, and the difference mainly occurs during the glider motion transition stage. Under the complex water current conditions, the dynamics response difference will be very significant, and the traditional dynamic models may exhibit the non-convergence issues. The comprehensive model established in this paper, which fully considers the ranges of attack angle, can better simulate the dynamics behavior of the glider and can provide certain theoretical guidance for actual application. © 2024 Elsevier Ltd",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85202959387&doi=10.1016%2fj.oceaneng.2024.118941&partnerID=40&md5=308053eb2042935d25b6b3dc62ec3a12,Ocean Engineering,2024
Scenario-level knowledge transfer for motion planning of autonomous driving via successor representation,"For autonomous vehicles, transfer learning can enhance performance by making better use of previously learned knowledge in newly encountered scenarios, which holds great promise for improving the performance of motion planning. However, previous practices using transfer learning are data-level, which is mainly achieved by introducing extra data and expanding experience. Such data-level consideration depends heavily on the quality and quantity of data, failing to take into account the scenario-level features behind similar scenarios. In this paper, we provide a scenario-level knowledge transfer framework for motion planning of autonomous driving, named SceTL. By capitalizing on successor representation, a general scenario-level knowledge among similar scenarios can be captured and thereby recycled in different traffic scenarios to empower motion planning. To verify the efficacy of our framework, a method that combines SceTL and classic artificial potential field (APF), named SceTL-APF, is proposed to conduct global planning for navigation in static scenarios. Meanwhile, a local planning method combining SceTL and motion primitives (MP), SceTL-MP, is developed for dynamic scenarios. Both simulated and realistic data are used for verification. Experimental results demonstrate that SceTL can facilitate the scenario-level knowledge transfer for both SceTL-APF and SceTL-MP, characterized by better adaptivity and faster computation speed compared with existing motion planning methods. © 2024 Elsevier Ltd",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85208136826&doi=10.1016%2fj.trc.2024.104899&partnerID=40&md5=560c48445e08aebc5845f7eadbcd4a48,Transportation Research Part C: Emerging Technologies,2024

Blockchain-based fast handover authentication protocol for Internet of Vehicles in small industrial parks,"Autonomous vehicles safeguard the security and efficiency of Internet of Vehicles systems in small industrial parks by authenticating and exchanging real-time information with transportation infrastructure. Deploying a multi-server framework reduces the risk of message blocking and privacy information leakage from centralized services. However, in traditional handover authentication protocols, there are still potential security risks such as high-overhead performance issues and single point of failure attacks. Therefore, it is considered challenging to realize efficient authentication while protecting the privacy of vehicles. In this paper, we propose a secure and efficient handover authentication protocol for autonomous vehicles in a small industrial park to address the challenges. The protocol is based on blockchain and Pedersen verifiable secret sharing scheme, which not only ensures lightweight real-time interactions between autonomous vehicles and edge servers in multi-server environments, but also strictly protects the security and privacy of both vehicles and edge servers. We prove the semantic security of the protocol under the Real-Or-Random model and perform a informal analysis of its security attributes to show that it can withstand a wide range of malicious attacks. Performance evaluation shows that the proposed protocol satisfies more security requirements and has better computational efficiency and communication cost than other related protocols. © 2024 Elsevier Inc.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85206991083&doi=10.1016%2fj.vehcom.2024.100848&partnerID=40&md5=a879d83d470a9fd900f2f821dc1630dc,Vehicular Communications,2024
A path planning method based on deep reinforcement learning for AUV in complex marine environment,"The potential of autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV) on future applications is significant due to advancements in autonomy and intelligence. Path planning is a critical technology for AUV to perform operational missions in complex marine environments. To this end, this paper proposes a path planning method for AUV based on deep reinforcement learning. Initially, considering actual requirements, a complex marine environment model containing underwater terrain, sonobuoy detection, and ocean currents is established. Subsequently, the corresponding state space, action space, and reward function are formulated. Furthermore, to address the inherent limitations of existing deep reinforcement learning algorithms in terms of training efficiency, a mixed experience replay (MER) strategy is proposed. This strategy aims to enhance the efficiency of sample learning by integrating prior knowledge and exploration experience. Lastly, a novel HMER-SAC algorithm for AUV path planning is proposed by integrating the Soft Actor–Critic (SAC) algorithm with the hierarchical reinforcement learning strategy and the MER strategy.

CFD-driven physics-informed generative adversarial networks for predicting AUV hydrodynamic performance,"A novel framework for predicting the hydrodynamic performance of autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs) is proposed based on computational fluid dynamics (CFD) and physics-informed generative adversarial networks (PIGAN). The physics information is embedded in the generator and discriminator, improving prediction accuracy and efficiency. The antenna position, height, and propeller diameter are modelled parametrically. Ultimately, 27 design schemes are constructed by combining the three variables and their three levels in full permutations. In the present study, 1440 groups of sample points and 270 groups of response points are obtained through CFD simulation for PIGAN training and testing. Furthermore, the prediction performance of CFD and PIGAN is compared, and the results show that PIGAN has significant advantages in efficiency and generalisability. The effects of antenna position and height on the AUV's flow field and motion performance are systematically analysed using the validated method.

Variational resolution probability maps for multi-UAV search tasks with changeable searching behaviors,"Cooperative search is a fundamental task in the autonomous control of multiple unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV) and much effort has been spent on finding an effective way to improve the global search performances. Two behavioral aspects are essentially considered during the multi-UAV cooperative search. One is the coverage (exploration) and the other is the retrospect to hotspot regions (exploitation). Most existing studies focus on the solutions to the former issue, by using the cognitive maps with fixed grid layouts, while ignoring the coexistence of both sides, which potentially induces the failures of finding hidden and indetectable targets. This paper presents a novel search method based on the cognitive maps with alternative grid settings, namely the variational resolution probability map (VRPM), to support the global searches with changeable phases and behaviors. To realize the transformations between different resolution maps in a given budget, the incremental learning is used to update the VRPM under limited number of samples. Potential games with different objectives are used to model the multi-UAV searching behaviors during explorations and exploitations. Lyapunov vector field (LVF) is then used to steer the UAVs toward their target grids in a given time horizon, so that the control period can be properly coincided with the temporal sequences of decision makings. Simulation results demonstrate the phase transitions from the explorations to the exploitations by the proposed method. Search accuracy and the retrospects to hotspot areas are also improved by comparison with the existing search strategies. © 2024 Elsevier Masson SAS",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85206449309&doi=10.1016%2fj.ast.2024.109669&partnerID=40&md5=0d29f42ba3a26ea48ac1837dd8143319,Aerospace Science and Technology,2024
Risk assessment for autonomous navigation system based on knowledge graph,"This paper presents a knowledge graph construction framework based on the Adversarial Interpretive Structure Model (AISM), aiming to reveal the failure interdependencies of autonomous navigation assemblies. The autonomous navigation system is divided into 6 systems with 43 failure modes. The hierarchical correlations between multiple systems are quantified by establishing the distance matrix and adjacency matrix, which are defined as triples to serve the entities and attributes for the knowledge graph. The centrality metrics are applied to evaluate the importance of nodes and to assess the stability of the knowledge graph. The coordination relationships between autonomous navigation systems and the impact associations of failure modes are discussed to validate the reasonability of the proposed framework. The results indicate that The NAVTEX operation panel and The installation base of the temperature sensor are the most essential components in the hierarchical results. The positioning system has a high degree centrality and betweenness centrality, while the server system has the highest closeness centrality. The propagation path from Decrease in positioning accuracy to The installation base of the temperature sensor is investigated, providing the methodological and data basis for decision-making. © 2024 Elsevier Ltd",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85207360542&doi=10.1016%2fj.oceaneng.2024.119648&partnerID=40&md5=250370c84351555a2120c5bc7225d85e,Ocean Engineering,2024
Model predictive control-based trajectory generation for agile landing of unmanned aerial vehicle on a moving boat,"This paper proposes a novel trajectory generation method based on Model Predictive Control (MPC) for agile landing of an Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) onto an Unmanned Surface Vehicle (USV)’s deck in harsh conditions. The trajectory generation exploits the state predictions of the USV to create periodically updated trajectories for a multirotor UAV to precisely land on the deck of a moving USV even in cases where the deck's inclination is continuously changing. We use an MPC-based scheme to create trajectories that consider both the UAV dynamics and the predicted states of the USV up to the first derivative of position and orientation. Compared to existing approaches, our method dynamically modifies the penalization matrices to precisely follow the corresponding states with respect to the flight phase. Especially during the landing maneuver, the UAV synchronizes attitude with the USV's, allowing for fast landing on a tilted deck. Simulations show the method's reliability in various sea conditions up to Rough sea (wave height 4 m), outperforming state-of-the-art methods in landing speed and accuracy, with twice the precision on average. Finally, real-world experiments validate the simulation results, demonstrating robust landings on a moving USV, while all computations are performed in real-time onboard the UAV. © 2024 Elsevier Ltd",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85206537200&doi=10.1016%2fj.oceaneng.2024.119164&partnerID=40&md5=1e4ad95ac4826ffbf44bbe2207986b47,Ocean Engineering,2024
An efficient DDoS attack detection and prevention model using fusion heuristic enhancement of deep learning approach in FANET sector,"Problem overview: A Flying Ad-hoc Network (FANET) is a decentralized communication network formed by Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs). However, it faces significant security challenges due to its decentralized nature and mobility. One of the most critical threats is the Distributed Denial-of-Service (DDoS) attack, which aims to overcome the network by flooding it with malicious actions, disrupting communication, and causing system failures. The primary challenge lies in detecting and mitigating such attacks in real-time, given the dynamic and complex nature of FANETs, where the rapid movement of UAVs complicates monitoring and defending mechanisms. Methodology: A novel detection and prevention model has been proposed to address the issue of DDoS attacks utilizing a hybrid heuristic-based machine learning approach tailored for FANET environments. The model begins by collecting necessary information using benchmark datasets to train and enhance the detection performance. The collected data is used for detecting the DDoS attack using Hybrid Deep Learning (HDL). The HDL model developed by combining Deep Temporal Convolutional Networks (DTCN) and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks, offers a powerful solution. DTCNs excel at detecting short-term, rapidly changing patterns in network traffic, which is essential for recognizing the instant effects of topology changes in FANETs. At the same time, LSTMs are designed to handle long-term dependencies and can used to the evolving patterns of UAV movement and traffic behavior over time. Here, the hyper-parameters are optimized by proposing the Hybrid of Water Strider and Cuckoo Search (HWSCS). Water Strider optimization (WSA) and Cuckoo Search Optimizer (CSO) are combined in the HWSCS algorithm. This algorithm is a versatile and powerful tool for optimizing multifaceted systems across different fields. Its combination of local and global search abilities allows it to find optimal solutions in complicated environments, making it invaluable for tasks ranging from machine learning to network security and beyond. In network security, HWSCS is effective in optimizing the parameters of intrusion detection systems, particularly in detecting complex cyber threats like DDoS attacks, ensuring more accuracy while reducing false positives. After detecting the DDoS attack, it is prevented from communication by establishing the routing process. This routing process involves rerouting the network traffic away from the affected areas and towards secure servers, effectively isolating the attack and minimizing its impact on the network. Additionally, it allows for greater flexibility and adaptability in responding to evolving threats in realtime. Here, the attack mitigation is accomplished by finding the Optimal Link State Routing (OLSR), estimated by the hybrid HWSCS algorithm. This algorithm determines the most efficient path for redirecting traffic away from the targeted servers, preventing overload, and maintaining network stability. The integration of HWSCS with OLSR not only improves network security but also proves the importance of innovative solutions in protecting malicious activities. Lastly, the model's performance is validated and measured with different metrics. Results: The proposed model demonstrated superior performance compared to traditional models. It achieved a recall of 93.87, significantly higher than other approaches like 89.22 for MobileNet, 89.40 for DTCN, 88.44 for LSTM, and 88.35 for DTCN-LSTM. This improved detection accuracy, combined with the effective routing mechanism, ensures better prevention and mitigation of DDoS attacks in FANETs. The results confirm the model's ability to not only detect attacks but also minimize network disruption, providing a robust solution for maintaining secure and stable communication in FANET environments. © 2024 Elsevier B.V.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85209680456&doi=10.1016%2fj.asoc.2024.112438&partnerID=40&md5=06060e48ee5f73c4fad7fa358045d27f,Applied Soft Computing,2024
Effects of cross-sectional shape on the low observability of double serpentine nozzles,"When unmanned combat aerial vehicles (UCAVs) egress from the battlefield after attacking the target, the defensive radar systems detect signals reflected by the cavity structure of the nozzle and engine of the UCAVs, threatening their survivability. Infrared (IR) guided missiles can also threaten them by detecting the gaseous plume and hot engine parts. We present a comprehensive investigation of the effects of the cross-sectional shape of double serpentine nozzles on thrust, IR signature, and radar cross section (RCS), which are associated with propulsive performance and low observability. The fillet radius and cross-sectional shape of the nozzles were considered as the main design variables. The thermal flow field was analyzed using the compressible Navier-Stokes equations, while the IR signature was analyzed with the radiative heat transfer equation with a narrow band model. The RCS was calculated using a multi-level fast multipole method of full Maxwell's equations instead of the approximate methods often employed. The double serpentine (DS) nozzle with an elliptical cross-section showed high pressure recovery and a 9.66 % lower IR signature than the DS nozzle with a rectangular cross section. The maximum RCS and mean RCS were lowest for the DS nozzle with an elliptical cross section, with a maximum difference in maximum RCS of 383 % and mean RCS of 90 % compared with the DS nozzle with a rectangular cross section. The DS nozzle with an elliptical cross section distributes the current more evenly across the central part of the engine than the DS nozzle with a rectangular cross section. The DS nozzle with an elliptical cross-section showed excellent nozzle performance with a negligible difference in thrust. In addition, the results show that the cross-sectional shape of the nozzles has different levels of impact on thrust and pressure recovery (negligible), IR signature (limited), and RCS (significant). © 2024 Elsevier Masson SAS",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85204706160&doi=10.1016%2fj.ast.2024.109593&partnerID=40&md5=3f5ff889c3d4e4c00afbec1b12af4316,Aerospace Science and Technology,2024
Application of uniform experimental design theory to multi-strategy improved sparrow search algorithm for UAV path planning,"The sparrow search algorithm (SSA) is a meta-heuristic optimization algorithm based on the predatory behavior of sparrows. However, SSA tends to fall into the local optimum when solving optimization problems with complex constraints. To improve its optimization efficiency and overall performance, this paper develops a multi-strategy improved SSA (ISSA) based on uniform experimental design theory. Specifically, the wrap-around L2-discrepancy (WD), as a uniformity metric for uniform design of experiments, is fully utilized with macro-regulation, adaptive dynamic management strategy, and boundary redistribution management mechanism to quantify the population uniformity in each iteration of ISSA. Inspired by the concept of uniform design, WD is initially adopted to gauge population uniformity, and the threshold acceptance (TA) algorithm is employed to produce an initial population with improved uniformity, hence augmenting the population's diversity and quickening the rate of convergence. Secondly, a macroscopical individual iterative strategy of the producer is adjusted to avoid the population converging to the origin. Then, a dynamic population uniformity affiliation function based on WD is introduced to adjust the population uniformity affiliation function according to the relative amount of change in the global optimum, and the number of danger perceivers is adjusted according to the affiliation function. What is more, a new boundary update strategy is also proposed in ISSA based on population uniformity. By comparing ISSA on 23 standard test functions and recently updated validation function set CEC2022 with the original SSA, and some classical as well as newly developed algorithms, the superiority of the present ISSA is thoroughly confirmed. As an application case, the ISSA algorithm is utilized to solve the path planning problem of the complex environment of unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) based on threat models by applying it to 2D maps containing circular and polygonal obstacles, as well as 3D maps containing mountain peaks and cylindrical obstacles. The simulation results show that ISSA can find more effective routes through various environments with obstacles. © 2024 Elsevier Ltd",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85199811115&doi=10.1016%2fj.eswa.2024.124849&partnerID=40&md5=0aee8f8a8e5a41fcfe49ac9d82fac6b4,Expert Systems with Applications,2024
Enhancing healthcare in the digital era: A secure e-health system for heart disease prediction and cloud security,"In the modern world, due to changing lifestyles, more people are infected by deadly diseases, especially heart disorders. An early prognosis is the only possible way of increasing survival rate. One of the key elements of this context is the healthcare digitalization that is carried out through Internet of Things (IoTs) and cloud computing. However, main issue in cloud with IoT is false diagnosis, which leads to cause a major impact on patient's life. Moreover, data communication through cloud servers can be compromised by attackers due to security issues. Therefore, to overcome these issues, this paper proposes a novel secure e-healthcare system with dual objectives- accurate disease prediction and improved cloud security. A novel diagnosis approach ‘Hybrid Binary Particle Firefly Optimized Extreme Learning Machine classifier (HybBPF-ELM)’ to predict HD is designed, that recognize the subject with HD abnormality from the normal ones. The prediction accuracy and time efficiency of training process are improved by the adoption of a Hybrid Binary Particle Firefly Optimizer (HBPFO) through fine-tuning weight and bias of Extreme Learning Machine (ELM) classifier. Additionally, a new intelligent encryption and decryption framework ‘IEDF’ is introduced for cloud security. It combines four encryption algorithms, including Advanced Encryption Standard (AES), Data Encryption Standard (DES), Rivest- Shamir-Adleman (RSA), and Modified Blow Fish (MBF) to enhance cryptographic strength and key security. Along with this, an Automatic Sequence Encryption (ASC) for data block encryption is employed to ensure strong security and network performance. The integration of HD prediction module and cloud security framework within e-healthcare system assists healthcare experts in securely storing and transferring data for advanced diagnosis. The results show that our proposed system achieves an overall prediction accuracy of 99.36 % and less processing time for encryption and decryption of 127.55 s and 452.01 s at 2.2 GB file size respectively. © 2024 Elsevier Ltd",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85196782300&doi=10.1016%2fj.eswa.2024.124479&partnerID=40&md5=6eeab19bfc27c85c5fbffea521dfe7aa,Expert Systems with Applications,2024
UAV imaging hyperspectral for barnyard identification and spatial distribution in paddy fields,"Barnyard grass (Echinochloa crus-galli), a noxious weed prevalent in rice fields, poses a significant threat to rice growth and development, ultimately leading to substantial yield reductions. Its morphological resemblance to rice plants complicates its identification and management. Consequently, accurately identifying and mapping barnyard grass in intricate rice field environments holds substantial research value and significance. Furthermore, most existing weed detection studies rely on single-day data, limiting the models’ generalizability. Therefore, incorporating multi-temporal data into modeling is highly desirable. This study utilized an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) to capture multi-temporal, low-altitude hyperspectral imagery of paddy fields, which were subsequently stitched, calibrated, and filtered using the SG convolution filter. The continuous projection algorithm (SPA) was employed to extract sensitive bands for discriminating between rice and barnyard grass. Initially, single-time data was utilized for barnyard grass identification, with models such as support vector machine (SVM), random forest (RF), 1D convolutional neural network (1DCNN), and 3D convolutional neural network (3DCNN) constructed using both full-spectrum and feature bands. The results indicated that the SPA-3DCNN model exhibited the highest performance in identifying rice (F1-score: 0.942) and barnyard grass (F1-score: 0.8936). Seven selected feature bands (482.5234, 546.5415, 675.0806, 709.1382, 762.0431, 922.0157, and 944.6371 nm) were found to be highly discriminative for distinguishing barnyard grass from rice. Subsequently, multi-temporal data modeling was employed to enhance the models’ generalization ability, resulting in improved overall accuracy (OA) and Kappa coefficients for each model, along with reduced misclassification rates. The spatial distribution maps also exhibited better performance with increased temporal data. The infestation trend of barnyard grass was visualized using multi-temporal difference maps, and a density map of barnyard grass was generated through image binarization. This study successfully demonstrated the feasibility of utilizing UAV-borne hyperspectral imagery for identifying barnyard grass in complex paddy field environments. By improving the model's generalization ability through multi-temporal modeling, the study provided robust data support for managing and preventing barnyard grass infestations, including the creation of spatial distribution and density maps for barnyard grass. © 2024 Elsevier Ltd",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85198314789&doi=10.1016%2fj.eswa.2024.124771&partnerID=40&md5=188f7de7a8826bf9e45726fb0b7b7b45,Expert Systems with Applications,2024
Reinforcement learning based robust tracking control for unmanned helicopter with state constraints and input saturation,"In this paper, an online adaptive optimal control scheme using reinforcement learning (RL) methodology is developed with applications to helicopters in the presence of input saturation and state constraints. Such a control scheme can overcome the strong nonlinearity and coupling dynamics of helicopters by deploying adaptive critic designs (ACDs). Firstly, the backstepping technique is employed to divide the helicopter system into a kinematic loop and a dynamic loop. In the kinematic loop, a constrained Hamilton–Jacobi–Bellman (HJB) equation containing a barrier function is designed to satisfy state constraints. In the dynamic loop, an input-dependent non-quadratic term is incorporated into the HJB equation to solve the input-constrained optimal control problem. Then, a radial basis function (RBF) neural network (NN) is introduced to establish actor-critic networks for the implementation of adaptive optimal control. The critic network is exploited to optimize the tracking performance, while the approximated optimal control for the nominal error dynamic model is derived from the actor network. Meanwhile, a disturbance observer based on RBF NN is designed to compensate for uncertain system dynamics and external disturbances. Using the concurrent learning technique, a novel online update law of actor-critic networks is designed to relax the persistence of excitation (PE) condition. Moreover, the uniform ultimate boundedness (UUB) of parameter estimation error and the asymptotic convergence of state tracking errors are proven through the Lyapunov-based stability analysis. Finally, simulation results are presented to demonstrate that the proposed control strategy is suitable and effective for the helicopter attitude and altitude tracking control problem. © 2024 Elsevier Masson SAS",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85203299358&doi=10.1016%2fj.ast.2024.109549&partnerID=40&md5=f2e7f3689c270ba5a8a004a6ce835fde,Aerospace Science and Technology,2024
Attack-resistant distributed formation control for multiple unmanned surface vessels subject to output constraints,"This paper investigates distributed formation control problem of multiple unmanned surface vessels (USVs) with directed communication networks. Several practical factors are taken into consideration, including the dynamic uncertainty of and prescribed output constraints imposed on each USV, as well as deception attacks against communication networks. Firstly, a new construction of formation error is proposed, which can be combined with any conventional controller to handle the output constraint problem of distributed systems without using leader observers and additional initial conditions. Importantly, this output constraint solution is also effective in situations where interactive information is tampered with due to deception attacks. Subsequently, based on the backstepping method and Lyapunov theory, a non-singular finite-time quantized controller is proposed by indirectly using fuzzy logic systems. The proposed controller achieves a proper balance between ensuring control performance and saving control resources. Finally, a comprehensive system stability analysis and numerical simulation are presented. © 2024 Elsevier Ltd",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85208761345&doi=10.1016%2fj.oceaneng.2024.119712&partnerID=40&md5=b542cda674170ad133d57a65af2fd2ff,Ocean Engineering,2024
Security situation assessment in UAV swarm networks using TransReSE: A Transformer-ResNeXt-SE based approach,"With the rapid development and extensive application of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), the issue of UAV swarm network security has become prominent. To protect the security of UAV swarm networks, effective network security defense measures are crucial. One key aspect is the assessment and monitoring of the network's security situation. However, most existing research focuses on the security of individual UAVs or detecting specific attacks, which fails to provide proactive protection for the network. To address this issue, we propose a UAV swarm network security situation assessment method, which combines the Transformer network with the optimization of the Aggregated Residual Transformations for Deep Neural Networks (ResNeXt) and squeeze-and-excitation (SE) structure (named TransReSE). By using multiple scale-cross convolution kernels, TransReSE can efficiently extract data features and improve situation assessment accuracy through the Transformer network. Experimental results from four public datasets have shown that TransReSE outperforms other schemes in terms of accuracy, recall, and F1. By assessing the value of the swarm network situation and the threat level, we can make faster, more effective decisions and proactively allocate resources to defend against UAV swarm network attacks. © 2024 Elsevier Inc.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85203412933&doi=10.1016%2fj.vehcom.2024.100842&partnerID=40&md5=3097be4d63e3785183365d3c019bfbfe,Vehicular Communications,2024
A two-stage framework for parking search behavior prediction through adversarial inverse reinforcement learning and transformer,"Parking scenarios are spatially dense and have a lot of interactions, making predicting vehicles’ search behavior crucial and challenging for autonomous driving. Existing data-driven prediction methods struggle to determine vehicles’ intents and consider the surrounding environment accurately. This study proposes a novel two-stage framework for parking search behavior prediction, involving parking intent and vehicle trajectory predictions based on imitation learning and deep learning. First, we develop an adversarial inverse reinforcement learning model for parking search intent (PSI-AIRL) learning from measured trajectory data in an actual parking lot. Then, we design an integrated convolutional neural network (CNN) and transformer model to forecast vehicle trajectory using historical observations and the predicted parking search intents. This two-stage framework achieves parking search intent prediction by applying global information about the parking lot while improving vehicle trajectory prediction's accuracy and robustness. Finally, the experiments are conducted on the Dragon Lake Parking (DLP) dataset to compare our framework with state-of-the-art models. The results show that our model outperforms other baseline models in accuracy for parking intent and vehicle trajectory predictions. Moreover, our model shows exceptional accuracy and robustness in predicting across diverse parking scenarios. © 2024 Elsevier Ltd",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85197018776&doi=10.1016%2fj.eswa.2024.124548&partnerID=40&md5=551a20906102c3fe223475796b711bc2,Expert Systems with Applications,2024
GUIDE: GAN-based UAV IDS Enhancement,"With the development of information technology, many devices are connected and automated by networks. Unmanned Areal Vehicles (UAVs), commonly known as drones, are one of the most popular devices that can perform various tasks. However, the risk of cyberattacks on UAVs is increasing as UAV utilization grows. These cyberattacks can cause serious safety problems, such as crashes. Therefore, it is essential to detect these attacks and take countermeasures. As a countermeasure, intrusion detection system (IDS) is widely adopted. To implement IDS for UAVs, it should be lightweight and be able to detect unknown attacks as a requirement. We propose GAN-based UAV IDS Enhancement (GUIDE) to meet the requirements. The GUIDE employs a generative adversarial network (GAN) for integer-valued sequence data augmentation to enhance an IDS's performance on known and unknown attacks. We used five GANs: SeqGAN, MaskGAN, RankGAN, StepGAN, and LeakGAN; we used four non-learning augmentation methods for the comparative experiment: oversampling, undersampling, noise addition, and random generation. The experimental results demonstrated that the synthetic data generated by GANs improved the detection of known attacks (up to 37 percentage points) and unknown attacks (up to 30 percentage points) while maintaining stable IDS performance. We also analyzed the synthetic data by employing Jensen–Shannon divergence, synthetic ranking agreement, and visualization; we confirmed that the synthetic data contained the characteristics of real data and could be used for training the IDS. © 2024 Elsevier Ltd",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85202345878&doi=10.1016%2fj.cose.2024.104073&partnerID=40&md5=719dbab03189617a29f65933fdac0234,Computers and Security,2024
Resilient Consensus Control of Heterogeneous Multi-UAV Systems With Leader of Unknown Input Against Byzantine Attacks,"This paper addresses the consensus control problem of heterogeneous multi-UAV systems against Byzantine attacks. A drone compromised by Byzantine attacks transmits erroneous values to its neighbors while applying wrong input signals for itself, which is aggressive and challenging to defend. Inspired by the concept of digital twin technology, we introduce a new hierarchical protocol equipped with a virtual twin layer (TL), which decouples the challenges into two defense schemes: one against Byzantine edge attacks on the TL and the other against Byzantine node attacks on the cyber-physical layer (CPL). In the TL, we provide a topology reconfiguration strategy that enhances the resilience of the communication network by judiciously adding a minimal number of key edges. We rigorously demonstrate that the control strategy attains asymptotic consensus within a finite timeframe, given that the topology on the TL adheres to a strongly (2 f + 1)-robustness criterion. Within the CPL, decentralized chattering-free controllers are proposed to ensure the resilient output consensus for the heterogeneous multi-UAV systems against Byzantine node attacks. Furthermore, the derived consensus controller exhibits an exponential convergence characteristic. The effectiveness and practicality of the obtained theoretical results are verified by a UAV swarm flight experiment. Note to Practitioners—Cooperative control of UAVs presents significant prospects for application and development, becoming a focal point of automatic control. By modeling UAV swarms as multi-agent systems, various complex distributed control methods have been conveniently proposed and implemented economically in practical systems. However, when certain agents are compromised and interfere with their neighbors, the whole network may become highly susceptible to failure. This paper specifically studies the resilient consensus control against the significant active internal threats, Byzantine attacks. The published results have primarily focused on cases where the leader UAV has no input signals. In practical applications, however, the leader often has a pre-established trajectory sent by the host and the followers are unaware of this input information. This significantly complicates the task of identifying Byzantine attackers. In this work, we introduce a new hierarchical protocol inspired by the concept of digital twin technology, which decouples the challenges into defense against Byzantine edge attacks on the TL and the defense against Byzantine node attacks on the cyber-physical layer. The experiment shows the feasibility and security of our control scheme, which provides valuable guidance for the practical applications of drones. © 2004-2012 IEEE.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-86000354904&doi=10.1109%2fTASE.2024.3420697&partnerID=40&md5=95982beca24da995dbbbf58c1c3126af,IEEE Transactions on Automation Science and Engineering,2025
t-READi: Transformer-Powered Robust and Efficient Multimodal Inference for Autonomous Driving,"Given the wide adoption of multimodal sensors (e.g., camera, lidar, radar) by autonomous vehicles (AVs), deep analytics to fuse their outputs for a robust perception become imperative. However, existing fusion methods often make two assumptions rarely holding in practice: i) similar data distributions for all inputs and ii) constant availability for all sensors. Because, for example, lidars have various resolutions and failures of radars may occur, such variability often results in significant performance degradation in fusion. To this end, we present t-READi, an adaptive inference system that accommodates the variability of multimodal sensory data and thus enables robust and efficient perception. t-READi identifies variation-sensitive yet structure-specific model parameters; it then adapts only these parameters while keeping the rest intact. t-READi also leverages a cross-modality contrastive learning method to compensate for the loss from missing modalities. Both functions are implemented to maintain compatibility with existing multimodal deep fusion methods. The extensive experiments evidently demonstrate that compared with the status quo approaches, t-READi not only improves the average inference accuracy by more than 6% but also reduces the inference latency by almost 15× with the cost of only 5% extra memory overhead in the worst case under realistic data and modal variations. © 2002-2012 IEEE.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-86000375165&doi=10.1109%2fTMC.2024.3462437&partnerID=40&md5=c66459329ddc7db376188356ec726b5e,IEEE Transactions on Mobile Computing,2025
Resilient Consensus Control for Multiple UAVs with Input Saturation under DoS Attacks,"In this article, a resilient consensus control method is proposed for nonlinear multiple unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) with input saturation and Denial of Service (DoS) attacks. First, an input saturation constraint based on the UAV dynamic model is investigated in this article, and an adaptive compensating term is developed to handle the input saturation. The DoS attacks considered in this article can interrupt all the communication transmissions of the attacked UAV from neighbors so that the victim is not able to receive any information from neighboring UAVs during DoS attacks. To deal with such a difficult problem, a fixed-time security constraint estimator (FTSCE) is proposed to ensure the stability and security of UAVs during the DoS attacks. Moreover, the unknown state is estimated to reduce the amount of the transferred information. Based on the proposed FTSCE, the relative position and velocity of UAV states are used to design the resilient consensus controller against the DoS attacks. By using the proposed controller, the system stability can be guaranteed according to the Lyapunov stability analysis. Finally, the numerical simulation is conducted to verify the effectiveness of the proposed resilient consensus control method. © 2025 IEEE.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-86000433029&doi=10.1109%2fTCYB.2024.3523965&partnerID=40&md5=535c59a6446ecffdacf2a88b1d1989e0,IEEE Transactions on Cybernetics,2025
GPS Spoofing Attack Recognition for UAVs With Limited Samples,"—As a malicious attack targeting on the GPS receiver, GPS spoofing attack interferes the normal received satellite signal by reproducing or relaying the signal, resulting in severe position deviation. Such attack has posed significant security threat to unmanned-aerial-vehicles (UAVs), especially in the era of low-altitude economics. However, due to the similarity of the spoofing and intended signal, and the presence of noise, accurate detection and recognition of GPS spoofing attack still remains a challenging issue, particularly in the case of limited samples. In this article, we apply the AdaBoost-CNN algorithm, which combines multiple weak convolutional neural network (CNN) classifiers into a strong classification model, to achieve GPS spoofing attack recognition. To further improve the recognition accuracy when there are very limited samples, we improve the AdaBoost-CNN algorithm by transferring previous network parameters to subsequent CNN. Both simulated and real measurement data are employed to verify the effectiveness of the proposed scheme. It is shown that the recognition accuracy can reach up to 93.75% and 95.83% with 160 simulated samples and 120 measured samples, respectively. © 2024 IEEE.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-86000384690&doi=10.1109%2fJIOT.2024.3465528&partnerID=40&md5=29a237afca3e9f9e89e6aa93686b8d42,IEEE Internet of Things Journal,2025
Empowering IoT-Based Autonomous Driving via Federated Instruction Tuning With Feature Diversity,"Integrating large language models (LLMs) with the Internet of Things (IoT) offer great potential for enhancing vehicle personalization and adaptability in autonomous driving (AD), particularly in open-world scenarios. However, the increasing scarcity of high-quality public data poses a challenge, which could hinder the progress of LLMs in AD. To address this, we propose a novel approach, federated instruction tuning (FIT), that leverages federated learning (FL) to enable collaborative training of a shared model across multiple data owners without sharing raw data, thereby preserving privacy and mitigating data scarcity. Complementing FIT, we introduce a feature diversity (FD) strategy that enriches visual and textual diversity and significantly expands AD data by generating new instruction-following data across key dimensions, such as time, weather, and occlusion. Extensive experiments using LLaMA-Adapter as the base model and four FL methods validate the effectiveness of the FIT framework and the FD strategy. Our analysis also compares LLMs ranging from 1.1 to 7B parameters, with results evaluated using GPT score, demonstrating the potential of FIT in AD. Our findings suggest that FIT and FD can support intelligent network operation and optimization in IoT, benefiting both the AD and artificial intelligence (AI) industries.  © 2024 IEEE.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-86000436544&doi=10.1109%2fJIOT.2024.3518615&partnerID=40&md5=28a2ddfcc40a9ea8fd8abf3ad4f73181,IEEE Internet of Things Journal,2025
A Novel Robustness-Enhancing Adversarial Defense Approach to AI-Powered Sea State Estimation for Autonomous Marine Vessels,"Sea state information is significant for the guide of maritime activities of autonomous vessels. The sea state estimation (SSE) model, powered by artificial intelligence (AI), has shown great effectiveness but is susceptible to malicious data attacks. These attacks can lead to significant declines in the system's performance and result in incorrect predictions about the sea state. This study introduces SecureSSE, a strategy for protecting SSE models in autonomous marine vessels from adversarial attacks. This approach incorporates three main components: 1) the multiscale feature extraction learning (MFEL) module; 2) the feature convolution aggregation learning (FCAL) module; and 3) the perturbation examples training (PET) module. The PET module is specifically crafted to create perturbation examples that are in line with unaltered data, leveraging the capabilities of both the MFEL and FCAL modules to efficiently extract and integrate detailed features from ship motion data. Our proposed SecureSSE approach is shown to significantly improve the resilience of deep learning models against potential attacks. Through experimental testing, we have validated the effectiveness of this method in enhancing SSE. Additional ablation studies highlight the critical role of each module within the SecureSSE framework. To our knowledge, this is the first study to address adversarial attacks in this context and to propose a comprehensive defense mechanism for SSE systems in autonomous marine vessels.  © 2024 IEEE.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-86000388590&doi=10.1109%2fTSMC.2024.3451718&partnerID=40&md5=b089115e83f742a69d2d21de0a9bd28e,"IEEE Transactions on Systems, Man, and Cybernetics: Systems",2025
Data-Driven Event-Triggered Sliding Mode Secure Control for Autonomous Vehicles Under Actuator Attacks,"This article investigates a comprehensive data-driven event-triggered secure lateral control of autonomous vehicles under actuator attacks. We consider stabilization issues of autonomous vehicles subject to modeling difficulties, limited communication resources, and actuator attacks. The dynamic model decomposition (DMD) from data is exploited to characterize the inherent lateral dynamics model of autonomous vehicles, the event-triggered transmission scheme is utilized to alleviate communication burden for limited bandwidth network, and the sliding mode control scheme is designed to ensure the security of autonomous vehicles under actuator attacks. The stability analysis and the stabilization method as well as its algorithm are presented. The proposed secure control scheme can actively counteract the malicious effects caused by actuator attacks and integrates the advantages of both data-driven modeling and model-based control design. Finally, several comparative case studies show the effectiveness of the proposed secure control scheme. © 2013 IEEE.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-86000374229&doi=10.1109%2fTCYB.2024.3490656&partnerID=40&md5=da208c73824547fc00e899de8ad12563,IEEE Transactions on Cybernetics,2025
Visual Servoing-Based Anti-Swing Control of Cable-Suspended Aerial Transportation Systems With Variable-Length Cable,"By utilizing a suspension cable to connect the payload with the quadrotor, transport tasks can be accomplished while preserving the unmanned aerial vehicle's agility and maneuverability, particularly in environments that are impassable for ground vehicles. Equipping onboard visual sensors and utilizing image-based visual servoing techniques, the application range of aerial transportation systems is poised to be significantly expanded in scenarios like autonomous landing and goods release. Unfortunately, within the system, there exist multiple layers of dynamic couplings between image features, quadrotor rotation, translation, and payload motion. These intricacies give rise to numerous difficulties in achieving smooth anti-swing transportation. To overcome the aforementioned difficulties, this paper presents the first image-based visual servoing control scheme for the aerial transportation system with variable-length cable. Specifically, the image moments defined on the rotated virtual image plane are taken as the image features, whose dynamics is independent of the quadrotor rotational motion. Subsequently, a generalized virtual image feature signal is introduced by organically combining the cable length and payload swing angles with the image feature, which is further exploited in the anti-swing control scheme design. The equilibrium point of the overall closed-loop system is proved to be asymptotically stable through Lyapunov techniques and LaSalle's Invariance Theorem. Hardware experiments are conducted on a self-built aerial transportation platform to verify the proposed controller's basic and functional performance in terms of rapid anti-swing and accurate target position and cable length tracking. Note to Practitioners - This paper is motivated by the requirement to improve the autonomy level and payload swing suppression ability of the aerial transportation system through visual servoing techniques. By installing onboard monocular camera and the cable length adjustment mechanism, the application scope of the aerial transportation system can be significantly expanded. However, due to the ""double""underactuated characteristic, the visual features couple with both the quadrotor motion and the payload motion, hence, it is quite challenging to realize visual servoing control for cable-suspended aerial transportation systems with simultaneous payload swing suppression and quadrotor positioning. Accounting for the foregoing problems, this paper proposes an image-based visual servoing anti-swing control scheme. With the elaborately constructed generalized virtual image feature signal, the designed controller could improve the anti-swing ability with a completed theoretical analysis. Furthermore, two groups of hardware experiments are conducted to validate the effectiveness of the suggested control method. In future studies, we intend to design more effective control scheme for payload delivery issue with consideration of the visibility of the mobile platform. © 2004-2012 IEEE.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-86000340482&doi=10.1109%2fTASE.2024.3434637&partnerID=40&md5=0ba7cc487638841ba75cfc413566fe69,IEEE Transactions on Automation Science and Engineering,2025
Smart Shield: Prevent Aerial Eavesdropping via Cooperative Intelligent Jamming Based on Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning,"The spotlight on autonomous aerial vehicles (AAVs) is to enhance wireless communications while ignoring the potential risk of AAVs acting as adversaries. Due to their mobility and flexibility, AAV eavesdroppers pose an immeasurable threat to legitimate wireless transmissions. However, the existing fixed jamming scheme without cooperation cannot counter the flexible and dynamic AAV eavesdropping. In this article, a cooperative intelligent jamming scheme is proposed, authorizing ground jammers (GJs) to interfere with AAV eavesdroppers, generating specific jamming shields between AAV eavesdroppers and legitimate users. Toward this end, we formulate a secrecy capacity maximization problem and model the problem as a decentralized partially observable Markov decision process (Dec-POMDP). To address the challenge of the huge state space and action space with network dynamics, we leverage a deep reinforcement learning (DRL) algorithm with a dueling network and double-Q learning (i.e., dueling double deep Q-network) to train policy networks. Then, we propose a multi-agent mixing network framework (QMIX)-based collaborative jamming algorithm to enable GJs to independently make decisions without sharing local information. Additionally, we perform extensive simulations to validate the superiority of our proposed scheme and present useful insights into practical implementation by elucidating the relationship between the deployment settings of GJs and the instantaneous secrecy capacity.  © 2024 IEEE.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-86000736626&doi=10.1109%2fTMC.2024.3505206&partnerID=40&md5=a3e6e0382f5857654549cec3f27a19f7,IEEE Transactions on Mobile Computing,2025
AoI Energy-Efficient Edge Caching in AAV-Assisted Vehicular Networks,"Mobile edge caching (MEC) has grown substantially with the rapid development in scale and complexity of data traffic. By exploiting the expansive coverage of autonomous aerial vehicles (AAVs), MEC enables services for massive vehicle users (VUs) simultaneously, which is promising for enhancing network transmission efficiency. Nonetheless, due to challenges arising from the timeliness and freshness of content services caused by AAVs' limited endurance and airborne capacity, caching strategy considering the real-time of content in large-scale dynamic Internet of Vehicles (IoV) environments remains open. With the above consideration, in this article, the cache refreshing cycle and content placement are jointly optimized in the cache-enabled AAV-assisted vehicular integrated networks (CAVINs) to minimize the content Age of Information (AoI) and energy consumption of the macro AAV. Since the joint optimization problem is variational coupled with nonconvex binary constraints, it is decoupled and solved by a double-iteration method. Specifically, the optimal cache refreshing cycle is derived in semi-closed form with the Karush-Kuhn-Tucker (KKT) conditions. The locally optimal solution of the content placement is obtained through successive convex approximation (SCA). Simulation results corroborate the effectiveness and superiority of the proposed scheme.  © 2024 IEEE.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-86000435117&doi=10.1109%2fJIOT.2024.3492535&partnerID=40&md5=ff6011284abbb114444c85988a590aeb,IEEE Internet of Things Journal,2025
Multi-Objective Aerial Collaborative Secure Communication Optimization via Generative Diffusion Model-Enabled Deep Reinforcement Learning,"Due to flexibility and low-cost, unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) are increasingly crucial for enhancing coverage and functionality of wireless networks. However, incorporating UAVs into next-generation wireless communication systems poses significant challenges, particularly in sustaining high-rate and long-range secure communications against eavesdropping attacks. In this work, we consider a UAV swarm-enabled secure surveillance network system, where a UAV swarm forms a virtual antenna array to transmit sensitive surveillance data to a remote base station (RBS) via collaborative beamforming (CB) so as to resist mobile eavesdroppers. Specifically, we formulate an aerial secure communication and energy efficiency multi-objective optimization problem (ASCEE-MOP) to maximize the secrecy rate of the system and to minimize the flight energy consumption of the UAV swarm. To address the non-convex, NP-hard and dynamic ASCEE-MOP, we propose a generative diffusion model-enabled twin delayed deep deterministic policy gradient (GDMTD3) method. Specifically, GDMTD3 leverages an innovative application of diffusion models to determine optimal excitation current weights and position decisions of UAVs. The diffusion models can better capture the complex dynamics and the trade-off of the ASCEE-MOP, thereby yielding promising solutions. Simulation results highlight the superior performance of the proposed approach compared with traditional deployment strategies and some other deep reinforcement learning (DRL) benchmarks. Moreover, performance analysis under various parameter settings of GDMTD3 and different numbers of UAVs verifies the robustness of the proposed approach.  © 2024 IEEE.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-86000761265&doi=10.1109%2fTMC.2024.3502685&partnerID=40&md5=c89700c8401d04e170dde970d4889054,IEEE Transactions on Mobile Computing,2025
TALKER: A Task-Activated Language Model Based Knowledge-Extension Reasoning System,"Training drones to execute complex collective tasks via multi-agent reinforcement learning presents significant challenges. To address these challenges, this letter introduces the Task-Activated Language model-based Knowledge-Extension Reasoning system. Specifically, we trained drones in two fine-grained skills and developed an action primitive library based on these capabilities, enabling a hierarchical approach to managing complex swarm operations. Leveraging this primitive library, we employ large language models to perform task planning, continuously refining the planning outcomes based on external user feedback. Successful task codes are temporarily stored within the action primitive library, with their utilization being authorized based on internal feedback from maintainers. We defined this process as knowledge expansion. In addition, more refined customized prompts are generated based on task descriptions and the action primitive documentation, a mechanism referred to as Task Activation. Our system synergistically integrates task activation and knowledge expansion mechanisms, enabling continuous evolution through human feedback to effectively manage extensive swarms in the execution of complex collective tasks. Experimental results demonstrate the superior performance of our system in various drone swarm tasks, including collaborative search, object tracking, cooperative interception, and aerial patrol. © 2016 IEEE.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-86000376629&doi=10.1109%2fLRA.2024.3511434&partnerID=40&md5=43507dca984c5ff3863922ca9007c54a,IEEE Robotics and Automation Letters,2025
Coupling Disturbance Modeling and Compensation for Aerial Manipulator in Highly Dynamic Motion,"When a manipulator moves in a highly dynamic scenario with a large range of rapid motion, the coupling disturbances between the manipulator and the UAV in the aerial manipulator system (AMS) become very strong, which directly affects the ability of the AMS to perform aerial manipulation and even poses a threat to the safety of the system. The aim of this article is to address the strong coupling disturbance problem in the AMS through precise coupling disturbance modeling and compensation. First, considering the rapid changes in the center of mass (CoM) and the moment of inertia (MoI) of the system under a highly dynamic scenario, this article delves into the generation mechanism of the coupling disturbances and models them based on the variable inertia parameters. The proposed precise coupling disturbance model (CDM) makes good use of the state information of the system, which enables one to achieve accurate estimation of the coupling disturbances without the aid of external force and torque sensors. With the proposed model, the strong coupling disturbances in the AMS are compensated in a feedforward way during the controller design process. An indoor AMS experimental platform is developed for validation purposes. The experiments and simulation are conducted in a highly dynamic scenario, involving rapid movements of the manipulator across a large range. The experimental and simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness and advantages of the proposed method for suppressing the strong coupling disturbances. © 2013 IEEE.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-86000387210&doi=10.1109%2fTCYB.2024.3476124&partnerID=40&md5=b0b5d026ba02b62e50e1730879336865,IEEE Transactions on Cybernetics,2025
Decentralized Multilayer Master-Slave Control Strategy for Power Management in Autonomous DC Microgrid Clusters,"DC microgrid clusters are effective solutions for integrating multiple autonomous subgrids at the same and different voltage levels. In such a system, global power management is an essential concern, but it is always degraded by system structures and line impedances of distributed generation units (DGUs). To solve this problem, a decentralized multilayer master-slave control strategy is proposed. In the selected master DGU, an ac signal is injected into the output voltage, and power information is carried by its frequency and consequently broadcast to other slave DGUs via power lines. In slave DGUs, the output power is regulated to track the demodulated power information, which generates voltage offset to realize power sharing in a single subgrid. The interlinking converter is exploited for interconnection between two subgrids, it is also used to transmit the broadcast power information from one subgrid to another one, which therefore ensures global power management throughout the dc microgrid cluster. All the control algorithms rely on only local measurement, and information transmission is implemented via existing power lines, no dedicated communication network is required. The effectiveness of the proposed strategy is validated by hardware-in-loop and experimental results. © 1982-2012 IEEE.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85218393813&doi=10.1109%2fTIE.2024.3443949&partnerID=40&md5=bf3c08c75d8b3a99645cac1928bed7a3,IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics,2025
High-Speed Interception Multicopter Control by Image-Based Visual Servoing,"In recent years, reports of illegal drones threatening public safety have increased. For the invasion of fully autonomous drones, traditional methods, such as radio frequency interference and GPS shielding, may fail. This article proposes a scheme that uses an autonomous multicopter with a strapdown camera to intercept a maneuvering intruder unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV). The interceptor multicopter can autonomously detect and intercept intruders moving at high speed in the air. The strapdown camera avoids the complex mechanical structure of the electro-optical pod, making the interceptor multicopter compact. However, the coupling of the camera and multicopter motion makes interception tasks difficult. To solve this problem, an image-based visual servoing (IBVS) controller is proposed to make the interception fast and accurate. Then, in response to the time delay of sensor imaging and image processing relative to attitude changes in high-speed scenarios, a delayed Kalman filter (DKF) observer is generalized to predict the current image position and increase the update frequency. Finally, hardware-in-the-loop (HITL) simulations and outdoor flight experiments verify that this method has a high interception accuracy and success rate. In the flight experiments, a high-speed interception is achieved with a terminal speed of 20m/s. © 2024 IEEE.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85215949203&doi=10.1109%2fTCST.2024.3451293&partnerID=40&md5=120136dcb92b85bbad00fe085560ad81,IEEE Transactions on Control Systems Technology,2025
Adapting to Frequent Human Direction Changes in Autonomous Frontal Following Robots,"This letter addresses the challenge of robot follow ahead applications where the human behavior is highly variable. We propose a novel approach that does not rely on single human trajectory prediction but instead considers multiple potential future positions of the human, along with their associated probabilities, in the robot's decision-making process. We trained an LSTM-based model to generate a probability distribution over the human's future actions. These probabilities, along with different potential actions and future positions, are integrated into the tree expansion of Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS). Additionally, a trained Reinforcement Learning (RL) model is used to evaluate the nodes within the tree. By incorporating the likelihood of each possible human action and using the RL model to assess the value of the different trajectories, our approach enables the robot to effectively balance between focusing on the most probable future trajectory and considering all potential trajectories. This methodology enhances the robot's ability to adapt to frequent and unpredictable changes in human direction, improving its navigation and ability to navigate in front of the person. © 2016 IEEE.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85217032537&doi=10.1109%2fLRA.2025.3537860&partnerID=40&md5=da2c79d4ba30f105fb60e04f08459ee1,IEEE Robotics and Automation Letters,2025
Cooperative Localization of Multi-Agent Autonomous Aerial Vehicle (AAV) Networks in Intelligent Transportation Systems,"GNSS-independent localization is one of the most prominent research problems in aerial autonomous systems navigation, especially in certain applications where Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM) methods are inapplicable due to the complexity of the environment, or in open-air spaces where a flock of Autonomous Aerial Vehicles (AAVs) navigate in a GNSS-independent fashion. This paper introduces a filter through which AAVs form a multi-agent Cellular Vehicle-to-Everything (C-V2X) network to exchange their estimated positions, and eventually achieve a group consensus over the true position of each vehicle. The localization error correction takes place in the filter with reference to the AAV's relative range from neighbouring vehicles, that is measured by onboard ranging devices. It is shown that in ideal situations where rangefinder errors can be neglected, cooperative localization yields perfect localization, if the network is sufficiently large and sufficiently connected. It is also shown that the accuracy of cooperative localization is superior to the existing least-mean-square-error based techniques, where a centralized controller augments the positioning accuracy of the flock. Cooperative localization is also favourable due to the fact that the process is computationally affordable and fully distributed. Theoretical derivations and results have been validated through case studies and Monte Carlo simulations, and suggest cooperative localization as a complementary navigation technique to odometery, and other advanced solutions that are available in the literature. © 2020 IEEE.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85216077407&doi=10.1109%2fOJITS.2025.3531363&partnerID=40&md5=6ada60f422169f00f82350b015f298d8,IEEE Open Journal of Intelligent Transportation Systems,2025
Toward Collaborative and Cross-Environment UAV Classification: Federated Semantic Regularization,"The rapid and widespread adoption of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) poses significant threats to public safety and security in sensitive areas and subsequently underscores the urgent need for effective UAV surveillance solutions, where UAV classification emerges as a vital technology. Deep learning (DL) methods can autonomously extract implicit features from UAV signals and subsequently infer their types, provided that sufficient signal samples are available. Due to the high mobility of UAVs, it is challenging to ensure continuous monitoring between UAVs and the surveillance system to obtain sufficient samples. Moreover, DL models developed from sufficient but environment-specific datasets tend to be less generalized. This paper proposes a novel federated semantic regularization for learning an UAV classification model and further classifying UAVs across diverse environmental conditions. The approach enhances model generalization by regularizing semantic features during the local model training process on each participant. Subsequently, these local models are aggregated into a robust global model. Extensive testing across multiple environments demonstrates the superior classification performance of our approach compared to existing non-federated and federated approaches. The average classification accuracy of the proposed method in the three environments is 95.68%, which is improved by 13.39% compared to the non-federated methods and by 2.75% compared to the federated methods.  © 2005-2012 IEEE.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85216109730&doi=10.1109%2fTIFS.2025.3531773&partnerID=40&md5=17d29ea7a51310e89c199051f0d0d4ce,IEEE Transactions on Information Forensics and Security,2025
Range-Based Multi-Robot Integrity Monitoring for Cyberattacks and Faults: An Anchor-Free Approach,"Coordination of multi-robot systems (MRSs) relies on efficient sensing and reliable communication among the robots. However, the sensors and communication channels of these robots are often vulnerable to cyberattacks and faults, which can disrupt their individual behavior and the overall objective of the MRS. In this work, we present a multi-robot integrity monitoring framework that utilizes inter-robot range measurements to (i) detect the presence of cyberattacks or faults affecting the MRS, (ii) identify the affected robot(s), and (iii) reconstruct the resulting localization error of these robot(s). The proposed iterative algorithm leverages sequential convex programming and alternating direction of multipliers method to enable real-time and distributed implementation. Our approach is validated using numerical simulations and demonstrated using PX4-SiTL in Gazebo on an MRS, where certain agents deviate from their desired position due to a GNSS spoofing attack. Furthermore, we demonstrate the scalability and interoperability of our algorithm through mixed-reality experiments by forming a heterogeneous MRS comprising real Crazyflie UAVs and virtual PX4-SiTL UAVs working in tandem. © 2025 IEEE.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85217044441&doi=10.1109%2fLRA.2025.3534068&partnerID=40&md5=ebca6db779f32f33baea1650565d6472,IEEE Robotics and Automation Letters,2025
Actuator and Sensor Attacks Against Multisensor State Estimation With Round-Robin Protocol,"In this article, we focus on the security issue of multisensor state estimation under actuator and sensor attacks. Due to the limitation of network bandwidth, we consider a scenario where the sensor data is transmitted following a round-robin protocol. If attacks can access all actuator and sensor channels, the necessary and sufficient conditions for the existence of joint attacks are presented. In this case, the attacks can cause the estimation to diverge while the corrupted innovation remains the same as that of the healthy system. When the attacked actuator or sensor channels are constrained, the existence of such a joint attack is investigated by taking into account the kernel space of system matrices. If only the sensor data are compromised, there is no strictly stealthy sensor attack, and we discuss the existence of sensor attacks with a relaxed stealthiness. The simulations are carried out on an autonomous aircraft system and an IEEE 6-bus power system to verify the effectiveness of the developed theoretical results.  © 2025 IEEE.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85216680622&doi=10.1109%2fTII.2025.3528546&partnerID=40&md5=950105c448b7a8eb844f1c162fd2947e,IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics,2025
MAVRL: Learn to Fly in Cluttered Environments With Varying Speed,"Autonomous flight in unknown, cluttered environments is still a major challenge in robotics. Existing obstacle avoidance algorithms typically adopt a fixed flight velocity, overlooking the crucial balance between safety and agility. We propose a reinforcement learning algorithm to learn an adaptive flight speed policy tailored to varying environment complexities, enhancing obstacle avoidance safety. A downside of learning-based obstacle avoidance algorithms is that the lack of a mapping module can lead to the drone getting stuck in complex scenarios. To address this, we introduce a novel training setup for the latent space that retains memory of previous depth map observations. The latent space is explicitly trained to predict both past and current depth maps. Our findings confirm that varying speed leads to a superior balance of success rate and agility in cluttered environments. Additionally, our memory-augmented latent representation outperforms the latent representation commonly used in reinforcement learning. Furthermore, an extensive comparison of our method with the existing state-of-the-art approaches Agile-autonomy and Ego-planner shows the superior performance of our approach, especially in highly cluttered environments. Finally, after minimal fine-tuning, we successfully deployed our network on a real drone for enhanced obstacle avoidance. © 2024 IEEE.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85213471793&doi=10.1109%2fLRA.2024.3522778&partnerID=40&md5=0df990c4a413fce6e13bbd37f7c616ca,IEEE Robotics and Automation Letters,2025
Semantically Adversarial Scene Generation With Explicit Knowledge Guidance,"Generating adversarial scenes that potentially fail autonomous driving systems provides an effective way to improve their robustness. Extending purely data-driven generative models, recent specialized models satisfy additional controllable requirements such as embedding a traffic sign in a driving scene by manipulating patterns implicitly at the neuron level. In this paper, we introduce a method to incorporate domain knowledge explicitly in the generation process to achieve Semantically Adversarial Generation (SAG). To be consistent with the composition of driving scenes, we first categorize the knowledge into two types, the property of objects and the relationship among objects. We then propose a tree-structured variational auto-encoder (T-VAE) to learn hierarchical scene representation. By imposing semantic rules on the properties of nodes and edges into the tree structure, explicit knowledge integration enables controllable generation. To demonstrate the advantage of structural representation, we construct a synthetic example to illustrate the controllability and explainability of our method in a succinct setting. We further extend to realistic environments for autonomous vehicles, showing that our method efficiently identifies adversarial driving scenes against different state-of-the-art 3D point cloud segmentation models and satisfies the constraints specified as explicit knowledge. © 2025 IEEE.

Detecting Subtle Cyberattacks on Adaptive Cruise Control Vehicles: A Machine Learning Approach,"With the emergence of vehicles featuring advanced driver-assistance systems like adaptive cruise control (ACC) and additional automated driving functionalities, there has arisen a heightened potential for cyberattacks targeting these automated vehicles (AVs). While overt attacks that lead to collisions are more conspicuous, subtle attacks that slightly modify driving behaviors can cause widespread impacts, including increased congestion, fuel consumption, and crash risks without being easily detected. To address the detection of such attacks, we first present a traffic modeling framework for three types of potential cyberattacks: malicious manipulation of vehicle control commands, data poison attacks, and denial-of-service (DoS) attacks. Subsequently, we examine the consequences of these attacks on both singular vehicle dynamics (micro) and broader traffic flow patterns (macro). We introduce a new anomaly detection model based on generative adversarial networks (GAN) designed for the real-time pinpointing of such attacks using vehicle trajectory data. Numerical results are presented to show the effectiveness of our machine learning strategy in identifying cyberattacks on vehicles equipped with ACC. The proposed approach is observed to outperform contemporary neural network models in detecting irregular driving patterns of ACC vehicles. © 2020 IEEE.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85214304096&doi=10.1109%2fOJITS.2024.3522969&partnerID=40&md5=846cd63b0634941ca101a3b4b4539bc2,IEEE Open Journal of Intelligent Transportation Systems,2025
LiDAR-BEVMTN: Real-Time LiDAR Bird's-Eye View Multi-Task Perception Network for Autonomous Driving,"LiDAR is crucial for robust 3D scene perception in autonomous driving. LiDAR perception has the largest body of literature after camera perception. However, multi-task learning across tasks like detection, segmentation, and motion estimation using LiDAR remains relatively unexplored, especially on automotive-grade embedded platforms. We present a real-time multi-task convolutional neural network for LiDAR-based object detection, semantics, and motion segmentation. The unified architecture comprises a shared encoder and task-specific decoders, enabling joint representation learning. We propose a novel Semantic Weighting and Guidance (SWAG) module to transfer semantic features for improved object detection selectively. Our heterogeneous training scheme combines diverse datasets and exploits complementary cues between tasks. The work provides the first embedded implementation unifying these key perception tasks from LiDAR point clouds achieving 3ms latency on the embedded NVIDIA Xavier platform. We achieve state-of-the-art results for two tasks, semantic and motion segmentation, and close to state-of-the-art performance for 3D object detection. By maximizing hardware efficiency and leveraging multi-task synergies, our method delivers an accurate and efficient solution tailored for real-world automated driving deployment.

Federated Training Generative Adversarial Networks for Heterogeneous Vehicle Scheduling in IoV,"In autonomous driving environments, generative adversarial networks (GANs) are often used to predict the future trajectories of objects in the scene, providing decision support for autonomous driving systems. However, integrating GAN models into the Internet of Vehicles (IoV) poses numerous challenges. First, GAN models necessitate user data and extensive computing resources, whereas diverse intelligent connected vehicle (ICV) possess limited bandwidth and computational capabilities, making it challenging to deploy models of the same scale as those in the cloud. Second, multifaceted aspects, including energy consumption, computation, communication, and vehicle training scheduling, have yet to be thoroughly examined, particularly in the context of IoV's limited resources. To address the above issues, we propose a novel federated learning framework, heterogeneous-vehicle-scheduling-GAN (HVS-GAN), for training GANs in resource-constrained IoV environments. HVS-GAN balances GAN generation quality and training costs in IoV. It supports multiple ICVs training GAN models of different structures, breaking the strong assumption of uniform GAN model size constraints in previous works and enabling collaborative learning within IoV. Furthermore, to balance quality and training costs, we incorporate deep deterministic policy gradients learning to manage varying model size constraints, training delays, and training consumption across participating ICVs. Experimental results and analysis confirm the superiority of our proposed HVS-GAN solution, which achieves better outcomes in IoV scenarios with stringent model size constraints compared to state-of-the-art algorithms.  © 2014 IEEE.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85211210760&doi=10.1109%2fJIOT.2024.3506159&partnerID=40&md5=c6b65bcec386647aa7667bdc98a2eb74,IEEE Internet of Things Journal,2025
An Adaptive Fault-Tolerant Control Scheme for Heterogeneous Multiagent Systems,"This article proposes an adaptive fault-tolerant control (FTC) scheme for heterogeneous multiagent systems with time-varying communication link faults and actuator faults. First, the communication link faults, including the channel signal fading and cyber bias attack, is considered, and the communication link fault compensation controller is designed through introducing the adaptive signals with the estimate of the norms of the faulty matrix. Then, by using the minimum eigenvalue of the control gain matrix, the minimum-eigenvalue-based adaptive fault-tolerant controller is proposed to compensate for the time-varying actuator loss of effectiveness and bias faults. Moreover, the convergence performance analysis of the developed FTC algorithm is given based on the Lyapunov theory. The simulation results carried out on the quadrotors-unmanned ground vehicles formation systems validate the effectiveness of the theoretical results. © 2013 IEEE.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85210754038&doi=10.1109%2fTSMC.2024.3496717&partnerID=40&md5=4a204c219f43cf1230f0dcff1befbaa4,"IEEE Transactions on Systems, Man, and Cybernetics: Systems",2025
A Bayesian Optimization Method for Finding the Worst-Case Scenarios of Autonomous Vehicles,"Scenario-based testing has become a crucial method for certifying the safety of autonomous vehicles amidst the rapid advancement of autonomous driving technology. The exploration of worst-case scenarios, which plays a vital role in safety assessments and accelerated improvements of autonomous driving systems, has posed challenges due to the high dimensionality of parameters and the uncertainty of the decisions of autonomous driving systems. To address these challenges, a Bayesian optimization framework was proposed herein as a solution. Surrogate models, including two Gaussian process-based and five non-Gaussian process-based models, are employed to replace part of the costly simulation models, to overcome the challenge of high dimensionality. The Jackknife and Bootstrap methods are used to estimate variance and calculate the acquisition function. Additionally, a differential evolutionary algorithm is employed to achieve efficient solutions while balancing exploration and exploitation, to overcome the challenge of output uncertainty. The proposed framework is validated through experimental results. It successfully identifies the worst-case scenarios in all three cases and the average number of tests for the optimal model in the most complex 9-dimensional scenario is less than 400. Notably, the approach using the Random Forest (RF) surrogate model achieves the highest search success rate in all three cases. © 2024 IEEE.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85210292096&doi=10.1109%2fTITS.2024.3490616&partnerID=40&md5=0649c58a2f90de40df81f0bb3e768523,IEEE Transactions on Intelligent Transportation Systems,2025
LHADRO: A Robust Control Framework for Autonomous Vehicles Under Cyber-Physical Attacks,"Deep reinforcement learning has demonstrated remarkable performance in autonomous vehicle control. However, the increasing threat of cyber-physical attacks, which can alter sensor information or vehicle dynamics, poses significant challenges to the robustness of these control policies. To address this, we propose LHADRO (Lambda-History Aware Diversity Robust Oracle), a novel framework that models robust control as a two-player game between control policies and cyber-physical attacks. The key contributions of LHADRO are: (1) A lambda-history aware mechanism that balances past and present meta-policies to enhance training efficiency and mitigates meta-policy thrashing, and (2) A joint diversity introduction mechanism that improves robust control performance by increasing population disparity through a regularization term in parameter updates. We validate the proposed method in MetaDrive-based environments. Experiment results verify that the LHADRO framework improves the robust control performance, and the effectiveness of some critical factors is investigated and discussed.  © 2005-2012 IEEE.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85209709635&doi=10.1109%2fTIFS.2024.3497808&partnerID=40&md5=fcf25fc8ced7acb522d7e84650a14b8e,IEEE Transactions on Information Forensics and Security,2025
Lightweight and Adaptive Data-Driven Intrusion Detection System for Autonomous Vehicles,"Autonomous vehicles are equipped with numerous electronic control units (ECUs). These ECUs are interconnected via in-vehicle networks to ensure safety, assist drivers, and perform various functions. A controller area network (CAN) facilitates real-time data transmission between ECUs. CAN provides sufficient reliability for communication within vehicles. Modern vehicles also utilize vehicle-to-everything (V2X) technologies. V2X enables vehicles to link to external networks, facilitating communication with other vehicles, infrastructures, and electronic devices. Modern vehicles' enhanced functionality and connections make them more susceptible to cyberattacks on both in-vehicle and external networks because of their extensive attack surfaces. To address this issue, this research presents a novel data-driven intrusion detection system (IDS) designed for in-vehicle and external communication networks. The proposed IDS can effectively detect many types of intrusions beyond the constraints of binary classifications. This system underwent a comprehensive evaluation using three in-vehicle datasets: car-hacking, car-hacking: attack & defense Challenge, and the ROAD datasets. Additionally, it was evaluated on two external communication network datasets: CICIDS2017 and CSE-CIC-IDS2018. The evaluation results demonstrated the IDS's adaptability, achieving significant accuracy, recall, and F1 scores. It attained up to 99.99% accuracy with the in-vehicle datasets. Moreover, it exhibited an exceptionally low false-positive rate, as low as 0, in the Car-Hacking dataset. The proposed IDS architecture is a lightweight approach compared to state-of-the-art models. It significantly reduced complexity in terms of Floating-Point Operations per Second (FLOPs), memory usage, and learning parameters, all without compromising performance. © 2000-2011 IEEE.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85212052725&doi=10.1109%2fTITS.2024.3509459&partnerID=40&md5=d3f3da4012d655c6919e77c488fc427f,IEEE Transactions on Intelligent Transportation Systems,2025
Traffic Control via Fleets of Connected and Automated Vehicles,"In this paper, we propose three control strategies, based on different levels of cooperation (centralized, decentralized and quasi-decentralized), to improve density dependent traffic performance indexes, such as fuel consumption, by acting on a small number of Connected and Automated Vehicles (CAVs) operating as moving bottlenecks on the surrounding flow. We rely on a multi-scale approach to model mixed traffic of CAVs in the bulk flow. In particular, CAVs are individually tracked and they are allowed to overtake (if on distinct lanes) or queuing (if on the same lane). Controlling CAVs desired speeds allows to act on the system to minimize the selected cost function. For the proposed control strategies, we apply both global optimization and a Model Predictive Control approach. In particular, we perform numerical tests to investigate how the CAVs number and positions impact the result, showing that few, optimally chosen vehicles are sufficient to significantly improve the selected performance indexes, even using a decentralized control policy. Simulation results support the attractive perspective of exploiting a very small number of vehicles as endogenous control actuators to regulate traffic flow on road networks, providing a flexible alternative to traditional control methods. © 2000-2011 IEEE.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85212133409&doi=10.1109%2fTITS.2024.3506703&partnerID=40&md5=5fb80748db067d0f828a212eeb9e42d7,IEEE Transactions on Intelligent Transportation Systems,2025
"Laser-Based LiDAR Spoofing: Effects Validation, Capability Quantification, and Countermeasures","Autonomous vehicles (AVs) and robots increasingly exploit light detection and ranging (LiDAR)-based 3-D object detection systems to detect obstacles in the environment. Correct detection and classification are important to ensure safe driving. Although previous work has demonstrated the feasibility of manipulating point clouds to spoof 3-D object detectors, most of these attempts are performed digitally. In this article, we investigate the possibility of physically fooling LiDAR-based 3-D object detection by injecting adversarial point clouds using lasers. First, we develop a laser transceiver that can inject up to 4200 points, and can measure the scanning cycle of victim LiDARs to schedule the spoofing laser signals. By designing a control signal method that converts the coordinates of point clouds to control signals and an adversarial point cloud optimization method with physical constraints of LiDARs and attack capabilities, we manage to inject spoofing point cloud with desired point cloud shapes into the victim LiDAR physically. We can launch four types of attacks, i.e., naive hiding, record-based creating, optimization-based hiding, and optimization-based creating. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our attacks against two commercial LiDAR and three detectors. We further analyze the impact of our attacks on four fusion-based detectors. This article concludes with experiments on defense methods and discussion on potential defense strategies at both the sensor and AV system levels. © 2014 IEEE.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85210998920&doi=10.1109%2fJIOT.2024.3496783&partnerID=40&md5=7be23fcb71301398f43e4350ddd8bd37,IEEE Internet of Things Journal,2025
Path Re-planning method of unmanned underwater vehicles based on dynamic bayesian threat assessment,"Due to numerous uncertainties in the environment, unmanned underwater vehicle (UUV) sometimes deviate from their originally planned paths. To address this issue, a path replanning algorithm based on threat assessment using a dynamic Bayesian network is proposed. This ensures that UUV can adjust their paths to avoid danger when facing uncertain events. Initially, the UUV plans a path using the PSO-SMPC (Particle Swarm Optimization-Stochastic Model Predictive Control) algorithm, utilizing environmental data. Subsequently, a dynamic Bayesian network evaluates the likelihood of uncertain events occurring based on environmental and UUV state information. The algorithm then determines the level of threat posed by these events and decides whether to activate the PSO-SMPC algorithm for path replanning accordingly. Simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness of this approach in enhancing UUV operational safety and improving mission completion rates across various uncertain event scenarios. Furthermore, compared to alternative methods such as simulated annealing and traditional genetic algorithms, the proposed algorithm exhibits superior path planning capabilities. © 2024 Elsevier Ltd",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85209672671&doi=10.1016%2fj.oceaneng.2024.119819&partnerID=40&md5=4095c10998f040f179bb9a9056e1ca7a,Ocean Engineering,2025
Barrier-Enhanced Parallel Homotopic Trajectory Optimization for Safety-Critical Autonomous Driving,"Enforcing safety while preventing overly conservative behaviors is essential for autonomous vehicles to achieve high task performance. In this paper, we propose a barrier-enhanced parallel homotopic trajectory optimization (BPHTO) approach with the over-relaxed alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM) for real-time integrated decision-making and planning. To facilitate safety interactions between the ego vehicle (EV) and surrounding vehicles, a spatiotemporal safety module exhibiting bi-convexity is developed on the basis of barrier function. Varying barrier coefficients are adopted for different time steps in a planning horizon to account for the motion uncertainties of surrounding HVs and mitigate conservative behaviors. Additionally, we exploit the discrete characteristics of driving maneuvers to initialize nominal behavior-oriented free-end homotopic trajectories based on reachability analysis, and each trajectory is locally constrained to a specific driving maneuver while sharing the same task objectives. By leveraging the bi-convexity of the safety module and the kinematics of the EV, we formulate the BPHTO as a bi-convex optimization problem. Then constraint transcription and the over-relaxed ADMM are employed to streamline the optimization process, such that multiple trajectories are generated in real time with feasibility guarantees. Through a series of experiments, the proposed development demonstrates improved task accuracy, stability, and consistency in various traffic scenarios using synthetic and real-world traffic datasets. © 2000-2011 IEEE.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85212433960&doi=10.1109%2fTITS.2024.3498457&partnerID=40&md5=a560c12a7dc2704046c3039fa9bd11ee,IEEE Transactions on Intelligent Transportation Systems,2025
An autonomous differential evolution based on reinforcement learning for cooperative countermeasures of unmanned aerial vehicles,"In recent years, reinforcement learning has been used to improve differential evolution algorithms due to its outstanding performance in strategy selection. However, most existing improved algorithms treat the entire population as a single reinforcement learning agent, applying the same decision to individuals regardless of their different evolutionary states. This approach neglects the differences among individuals within the population during evolution, reducing the likelihood of individuals evolving in promising directions. Therefore, this paper proposes an Autonomous Differential Evolution (AuDE) algorithm guided by the cumulative performance of individuals. In AuDE, at the individual level, the rate of increase in each individual's cumulative reward is used to guide the selection of appropriate search strategies. This ensures that all individuals accumulate experience from their own evolutionary search process, rather than relying on the experiences of others or the population, which may not align with their unique characteristics. Additionally, at the global level, a population backtracking method with stagnation detection is proposed. This method fully utilizes the learned cumulative experience information to enhance the global search ability of AuDE, thereby strengthening the search capability of the entire population. To verify the effectiveness and advantages of AuDE, 15 functions from CEC2015, 28 functions from CEC2017, and a real-world optimization problem on cooperative countermeasures of unmanned aerial vehicles were used to evaluate its performance compared with state-of-the-art DE variants. The experimental results indicate that the overall performance of AuDE is superior to other compared algorithms. © 2024 Elsevier B.V.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85211970741&doi=10.1016%2fj.asoc.2024.112605&partnerID=40&md5=a1ada4b272188ec6d8f241da4a2f8679,Applied Soft Computing,2025
Top-Down Attention-Based Mechanisms for Interpretable Autonomous Driving,"Despite the remarkable advancements in autonomous driving, the challenge persists in achieving interpretable action decision-making, primarily owing to the intricate and ambiguous relationship between detected agents and driving intention. In this study, we introduce an interpretable action prediction model, denoted as the Prediction-Driven Attention Network (PDANet), designed to undertake action decisions and provide corresponding interpretations cohesively. The PDANet is inspired by the perceptual mechanisms inherent in human drivers, who allocate attention according to their driving intentions. Specifically, we elaborate a prediction module to generate vehicle prospective trajectories to characterize driving intentions. Subsequently, the features of this predicted trajectory are utilized to modulate the attention distribution among agents through the top-down attention module, yielding an attention map. Finally, two distinct task tokens are applied to aggregate agent features and generate the final output according to the derived attention map. Extensive experiments conducted on the publicly available BDD-OIA and nu-AR datasets demonstrate that our proposed method outperforms all prior works in terms of both action prediction and behavior interpretation tasks. Remarkably, our method attains a noteworthy enhancement in the behavior interpretation task, surpassing the previous state-of-the-art by a substantial margin of +10.8% in terms of F1-score on the nu-AR dataset. We also validate our algorithm on Carla Town05 long in a closed-loop decision-making scenario, highlighting the generality and robustness of our approach. Furthermore, qualitative results show that the agents selected by our model are more closely aligned with human cognitive processes. © 2000-2011 IEEE.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85212123232&doi=10.1109%2fTITS.2024.3510853&partnerID=40&md5=366cfa4f4ff90c262abcd2321facafac,IEEE Transactions on Intelligent Transportation Systems,2025
Systematic Literature Review: Anomaly Detection in Connected and Autonomous Vehicles,"This systematic literature review provides a structured and detailed overview of research on anomaly detection for connected and autonomous vehicles, focusing on the Artificial Intelligence methods employed, training approaches, and testing and evaluation techniques. The initial database search identified 2,160 articles, of which 203 were included in this review after rigorous screening and assessment. This study revealed that the most commonly used anomaly detection techniques employed are deep learning networks such as LSTM, CNN, and autoencoders, alongside one-class SVM. Most detection models were trained using real-world operational vehicle data, although anomalies, such as attacks and faults, were often injected artificially into the datasets. The models were evaluated primarily using five key evaluation metrics: recall, accuracy, precision, F1-score, and false positive rate. The most frequently used set of evaluation metrics for detection models were accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score. The review makes several recommendations to improve future work related to anomaly detection models. It recommends providing comprehensive assessment of the anomaly detection models and emphasise the importance to share models publicly to facilitate collaboration within the research community and enable further validation. Recommendations also include the need for benchmarking datasets with predefined anomalies or cyberattacks (with comprehensive threat modelling) to test and improve the effectiveness of the proposed anomaly detection models.

Improving String Stability in Cooperative Adaptive Cruise Control Through Multiagent Reinforcement Learning With Potential-Driven Motivation,"Cooperative adaptive cruise control (CACC) is regarded as a promising technology for achieving efficient and safe collaboration among connected and automated vehicles (CAVs) in a platoon, and multiagent reinforcement learning (MARL) methods are emerging as an effective approach to implementing the CACC technology. However, most MARL methods do not sufficiently tackle the prevalent string stability problem, even when integrating communication mechanisms to improve agents’ understanding of CACC scenarios. This limitation arises because these methods typically learn communication mechanisms based solely on the information directly observable by the agents, neglecting potentially valuable information present in the environment. In this article, we propose a multiagent actor–critic with a potential-driven motivation (MAACPM) approach, which utilizes variational inference theory to infer the potential motivation representation space in the CACC task, providing a more favorable opportunity for adjusting driving behavior within the platoon. Furthermore, we quantify the specific impact of potential motivation on each vehicle by measuring the difference between policies with and without potential motivation. We then utilize this difference as a potential reward signal to incentivize the agent to grasp effective potential motivation. The proposed method was validated in two typical CACC scenarios, where we compared the performance of our MAACPM algorithm with other state-of-the-art MARL methods to demonstrate its effectiveness. Furthermore, we illustrate potential real-world applications of our method by comparing it with actual vehicle driving data. © 2020 IEEE.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85212065942&doi=10.1109%2fTAI.2024.3511513&partnerID=40&md5=a1a765955eba08d10ec312e087fec151,IEEE Transactions on Artificial Intelligence,2025

VREM-FL: Mobility-Aware Computation-Scheduling Co-Design for Vehicular Federated Learning,"Assisted and autonomous driving are rapidly gaining momentum and will soon become a reality. Artificial intelligence and machine learning are regarded as key enablers thanks to the massive amount of data that smart vehicles will collect from onboard sensors. Federated learning is one of the most promising techniques for training global machine learning models while preserving data privacy of vehicles and optimizing communications resource usage. In this article, we propose vehicular radio environment map federated learning (VREM-FL), a computation-scheduling co-design for vehicular federated learning that combines mobility of vehicles with 5G radio environment maps. VREM-FL jointly optimizes learning performance of the global model and wisely allocates communication and computation resources. This is achieved by orchestrating local computations at the vehicles in conjunction with transmission of their local models in an adaptive and predictive fashion, by exploiting radio channel maps. The proposed algorithm can be tuned to trade training time for radio resource usage.

Energy Efficient Defense Against Cooperative Hostile Detection and Eavesdropping Attacks for AAV-Aided Short-Packet Transmissions,"Autonomous aerial vehicle (AAV)-aided short-packet transmissions have emerged as a promising paradigm for supporting mission-critical applications in future mobile communication networks. However, the security issues raised by the open nature of the wireless transmission deserve attention, especially when confronted with cooperative wardens and eavesdroppers. To this end, we consider a new framework for an energy-efficient design of AAV-aided short-packet transmission systems against cooperative hostile detection and eavesdropping attacks. Specifically, the false rate of the cooperative hostile detection is first derived by utilizing the likelihood ratio test and the bivariate Gaussian distribution property. Then, we formulate a problem to maximize the minimum covert secrecy energy efficiency (MCSEE) by jointly optimizing the user association, AAV power control, and AAV three-dimensional (3D) trajectory design. We propose a penalty-based dual-loop iterative optimization algorithm to tackle this complex problem suboptimally with the aid of auxiliary penalty variables, where the communication resource scheduling, the AAV trajectory planning, and the auxiliary penalty variables are optimized in the inner loop. In particular, the intractable joint AAV power control and 3D trajectory design sub-problem is suboptimally addressed by introducing slack variables and employing successive convex approximation (SCA) techniques. The penalty factor is updated in the outer loop. Finally, numerical results are provided to verify the effectiveness and superiority of our proposed solution to several benchmarks.  © 2024 IEEE.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85207436478&doi=10.1109%2fTVT.2024.3483256&partnerID=40&md5=1246e44d244777d62abe35782d7a6678,IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology,2025
AAV 3-D Path Planning Based on MOEA/D With Adaptive Areal Weight Adjustment,"Autonomous aerial vehicles (AAVs) are desirable platforms for time-efficient and cost-effective task execution. 3-D path planning problems for AAVs can be treated as constrained multiobjective optimization problems. However, due to the complexity of real-world problems, the Pareto front frequently exhibits irregularity. For path planning problems characterized by sharp peaks and low tails on the Pareto front, this article proposes a multiobjective evolutionary algorithm based on decomposition (MOEA/D) with an adaptive areal weight adjustment (AAWA) strategy to make a tradeoff between the total flight path length and the terrain threat. AAWA is designed to improve the diversity and uniformity of the solutions. More specifically, AAWA first removes a crowded individual and its weight vector from the current population and then adds a sparse individual from the external elite population to the current population. To enable the newly added individual to evolve toward the sparser area of the population in the objective space, its weight vector is constructed by the objective function value of its neighbors. The experimental results in three types of synthetic scenarios and one realistic scenario demonstrate that MOEA/D-AAWA achieves uniformly distributed and diverse path solutions on sharp peaks and low tails, and provides a desired and collision-free compromise path.  © 1965-2011 IEEE.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85202745741&doi=10.1109%2fTAES.2024.3449795&partnerID=40&md5=894d973c7b092915f8f5392a41622520,IEEE Transactions on Aerospace and Electronic Systems,2025
Communication-Efficient Soft Actor-Critic Policy Collaboration via Regulated Segment Mixture,"Multiagent reinforcement learning (MARL) has emerged as a foundational approach for addressing diverse, intelligent control tasks in various scenarios like the Internet of Vehicles, Internet of Things, and unmanned aerial vehicles. However, the widely assumed existence of a central node for centralized, federated learning-assisted MARL might be impractical in highly dynamic environments. This can lead to excessive communication overhead, potentially overwhelming the system. To address these challenges, we design a novel communication-efficient, fully distributed algorithm for collaborative MARL under the frameworks of soft actor-critic (SAC) and decentralized federated learning (DFL), named regulated segment mixture-based multiagent SAC (RSM-MASAC). In particular, RSM-MASAC enhances multiagent collaboration and prioritizes higher communication efficiency in dynamic systems by incorporating the concept of segmented aggregation in DFL and augmenting multiple model replicas from received neighboring policy segments, which are subsequently employed as reconstructed referential policies for mixing. Distinctively diverging from traditional reinforcement learning (RL) approaches, RSM-MASAC introduces new bounds under the framework of maximum entropy reinforcement learning (MERL). Correspondingly, it adopts a theory-guided mixture metric to regulate the selection of contributive referential policies, thus guaranteeing soft policy improvement during the communication-assisted mixing phase.

Toward Crash-Free Autonomous Driving: Anomaly Detection and Control for Resilience to Stealthy Sensor Attacks,"Cooperative adaptive cruise control (CACC) enables connected and automated vehicles (CAVs) to drive autonomously on the highway in closely coupled platoons. The use of CACC technologies increases safety and the traffic throughput, and decreases fuel consumption and CO2 emissions. However, CAVs heavily rely on embedded software, hardware, and communication networks that make them vulnerable to a range of cyberattacks. Cyberattacks to a particular CAV compromise the entire platoon as CACC schemes propagate corrupted data to neighboring vehicles potentially leading to traffic delays and collisions. Physics-based monitors can be used to detect the presence of false data injection (FDI) attacks to CAV sensors; however, given enough system knowledge, adversaries are still able to launch a range of attacks that can surpass the detection scheme by hiding within the system disturbances and uncertainty - we refer to this class of attacks as stealthy FDI attacks. Stealthy attacks are hard to deal with as they affect the platoon dynamics without being noticed. In this manuscript, we propose a design methodology (built around a series convex programs) to synthesize distributed attack monitors and H∞ CACC controllers that minimize the joint effect of stealthy FDI attacks and system disturbances on the platoon dynamics while guaranteeing a prescribed platooning performance. Computer simulations are provided to illustrate the performance of our tools.  © 2014 IEEE.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85205141293&doi=10.1109%2fJIOT.2024.3459590&partnerID=40&md5=576b904d1be18e054ff39c4c49f4d948,IEEE Internet of Things Journal,2025
NPE-DRL: Enhancing Perception Constrained Obstacle Avoidance With Nonexpert Policy Guided Reinforcement Learning,"Obstacle avoidance under constrained visual perception presents a significant challenge, requiring rapid detection and decision-making within partially observable environments, particularly for unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) maneuvering agilely in 3-D space. Compared with traditional methods, obstacle avoidance algorithms based on deep reinforcement learning (DRL) offer a better comprehension of the uncertain operational environment in an end-to-end manner, reducing computational complexity, and enhancing flexibility and scalability. However, the inherent trial-and-error learning mechanism of DRL necessitates numerous iterations for policy convergence, leading to sample inefficiency issues. Meanwhile, existing sample-efficient obstacle avoidance approaches that leverage imitation learning often heavily rely on offline expert demonstrations, which are not always feasible in hazardous environments. To address these challenges, we propose a novel obstacle avoidance approach based on nonexpert policy enhanced DRL (NPE-DRL). This approach integrates a fundamental DRL framework with prior knowledge derived from a nonexpert policy-guided imitation learning. During the training phase, the agent starts by online imitating the actions generated by the nonexpert policy during interactions and progressively shifts toward autonomously exploring the environment to generate the optimal policy. Both simulation and physical experiments validate that our approach improves sample efficiency and achieves a better exploration-exploitation balance in both virtual and real-world flights. Additionally, our NPE-DRL-based obstacle avoidance approach shows better adaptability in complex environments characterized by larger scales and denser obstacle configurations, demonstrating a significant improvement in UAVs' obstacle avoidance capability.

Optimal deception attacks under energy harvesting constraints for cyber–physical systems,"This paper investigates the design of optimal deception attacks against remote state estimation, where the attacker is equipped with energy harvesting capability to supply more energy resources for implementing the attacks. To derive the optimal attack parameters and energy allocation strategy collaboratively, the attack design problem is transformed into a multi-variable constrained optimization problem which is solved by employing the proposed stepwise optimization method without sacrificing the optimality. Specifically, the analytical expression of the optimal attack parameters is firstly derived based on the presented data isolation technique, which removes the conservatism of the existing results where the attack schemes are merely suboptimal or the attack targets are limited to the systems without redundant sensors. Then, by analyzing the intrinsic property of the average estimation error, the optimal allocation of the dynamic attack energy is obtained to maximize the attack effect. Finally, the simulations are given to verify the developed results. © 2024 Elsevier B.V.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85204957997&doi=10.1016%2fj.neucom.2024.128652&partnerID=40&md5=10a49e89bf899048b93c2c2be56551be,Neurocomputing,2025
TEE-MR: Developer-friendly data oblivious programming for trusted execution environments,"Trusted execution environments (TEEs) enable efficient protection of integrity and confidentiality for applications running on untrusted platforms. They have been deployed in cloud servers to attract users who have concerns on exporting data and computation. However, recent studies show that TEEs’ side channels, including memory, cache, and micro-architectural features, are still vulnerable to adversarial exploitation. As many such attacks utilize program access patterns to infer secret information, data oblivious programs have been considered a practical defensive solution. However, they are often difficult to develop and optimize via either manual or automated approaches. We present the oblivious TEE with MapReduce (TEE-MR) approach that uses application frameworks, an approach between fully manual and fully automated, to hide the details of access-pattern protection to significantly minimize developers’ efforts. We have implemented the approach with the MapReduce application framework for data-intensive applications. It can regulate application dataflows and hide application-agnostic access-pattern protection measures from developers. Compared to manual composition approaches, it demands much less effort for developers to identify access patterns and to write code. Our approach is also easy to implement, less complicated than fully automated approaches, for which we have not seen a working prototype yet. Our experimental results show that TEE-MR-based applications have good performance, comparable to those carefully developed with time-consuming manual composition approaches. © 2024 Elsevier Ltd",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85204763064&doi=10.1016%2fj.cose.2024.104119&partnerID=40&md5=a008894226046f2b88bdfca2e7fd3a26,Computers and Security,2025
Reconfigurable Intelligent Computational Surfaces for MEC-Assisted Autonomous Driving Networks: Design Optimization and Analysis,"This paper focuses on improving autonomous driving safety via task offloading from cellular vehicles (CVs), using vehicle-to-infrastructure (V2I) links, to a multi-access edge computing (MEC) server. Considering that the V2I links sometimes can be reused by vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) communications to improve spectrum utilization, the receiver of the V2I link may suffer from severe interference, causing outages during the task offloading. To tackle this issue, we propose the deployment of a reconfigurable intelligent computational surface (RICS) to enable, not only V2I reflective links but also interference cancellation at the V2V links exploiting the computational capability of its metamaterials. We devise a joint optimization formulation for the task offloading ratio between the CVs and the MEC server, the spectrum sharing strategy between V2V and V2I communications, as well as the RICS reflection and refraction matrices, to maximize a safety-based autonomous driving task. Due to the non-convexity of the problem and the coupling among its free variables, we transform it into a more tractable equivalent form, which is then decomposed into three sub-problems and solved via an alternate approximation method. Simulation results show that the proposed RICS-assisted offloading framework significantly improves the safety of the autonomous driving network, in which the safety coefficient of the CVs is improved by nearly 34%. The V2V data rate is improved by around 60%, which indicates that the RICS's adjustment of the signals can effectively mitigate the interference of the V2V link.  © 2000-2011 IEEE.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85208988542&doi=10.1109%2fTITS.2024.3486555&partnerID=40&md5=8760a434d13a634517010a8f03c3762f,IEEE Transactions on Intelligent Transportation Systems,2025
Cooperative task assignment of heterogeneous unmanned aerial vehicles for simultaneous multi-directional attack on a moving target,"Multiple unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) attacks, on moving targets with directional priorities, need careful task allocation especially when the UAVs have variable attacking power. In addition, the constraints of simultaneous attack from different directions multi-folds the complexity of the problem. In this work, an extended contract net protocol (ECNP) based autonomous and cooperative task assignment method is proposed to deal with the time-sensitive position assignment for multi-directional attack and uniform resource allocation. Initially, an optimization problem is formulated using distances between each UAV and expected attack positions (APs), arrival time, and attack power. In addition, for uniform resource allocation, a variable is introduced to monitor available resources at a given time. An agent-based model is built with UAV information, such as position and speed, along with the direction of the high-value moving target (HVMT). Each UAV identifies the possible arrival points based on its speed constraints, and current position, and the position and velocity of HVMT. Moreover, distance and expected arrival time to all APs are computed. Finally, the agents make attack point allocations using the proposed ECNP after making a consensus about simultaneous attack time. The proposed method ensures uniform resource allocation. The simulation results show the superiority of the proposed method (ECNP) in comparison with classical contract net protocol (CNP) and Genetic Algorithms (GA) in terms of uniform resource allocation and mission accomplishment. © 2024 Elsevier Ltd",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85209071612&doi=10.1016%2fj.engappai.2024.109595&partnerID=40&md5=5372e5d41ffba3a22877f15b838f1b96,Engineering Applications of Artificial Intelligence,2025
Underwater Target Tracking Based on Interrupted Software-Defined Multi-AUV Reinforcement Learning: A Multi-AUV Time-Saving MARL Approach,"With the rapid development of underwater materials technology and underwater robot technology, human exploitation of marine resources has been increasingly advanced, which has given rise to various application scenarios for Autonomous Underwater Vehicle (AUV) cluster networks, such as cooperative data collection and target tracking. In this paper, we aim to explore how to utilize networking and swarm intelligence to improve the AUV cluster network's target tracking performance in a time-saving manner. Specifically, on account of our previous work, we introduce an underwater interrupted mechanism and propose an Interrupted Software-Defined Multi-AUV Reinforcement Learning (ISD-MARL) architecture. For MARL algorithm in ISD-MARL, we propose a time-saving MARL algorithm, S-MADDPG, integrating our proposed action optimization model and action network loss function, to accelerate the convergence of the MARL algorithm. Furthermore, to further improve the AUV cluster network's path planning performance during the target tracking, we propose an Interrupted Tracking Path Planning Scheme (ITPPS) for the AUV cluster network based on the proposed ISD-MARL and S-MADDPG. The evaluation results showcase that our proposed scheme can effectively plan the underwater target tracking path for the AUV cluster network in a shorter time and outperform various mainstream strategies in terms of convergence speed and training time, etc.  © 2002-2012 IEEE.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85208552561&doi=10.1109%2fTMC.2024.3490545&partnerID=40&md5=6312501dd446ee7bd68ec940a8249b2c,IEEE Transactions on Mobile Computing,2025
Engineering applications of artificial intelligence a knowledge-guided reinforcement learning method for lateral path tracking,"Lateral Control algorithms in autonomous vehicles often necessitates an online fine-tuning procedure in the real world. While reinforcement learning (RL) enables vehicles to learn and improve the lateral control performance through repeated trial and error interactions with a dynamic environment, applying RL directly to safety-critical applications in real physical world is challenging because ensuring safety during the learning process remains difficult. To enable safe learning, a promising direction is to make use of previously gathered offline data, which is frequently accessible in engineering applications. In this context, this paper presents a set of knowledge-guided RL algorithms that can not only fully leverage the prior collected offline data without the need of a physics-based simulator, but also allow further online policy improvement in a smooth, safe and efficient manner. To evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithms on a real controller, a hardware-in-the-loop and a miniature vehicle platform are built. Compared with the vanilla RL, behavior cloning and the existing controller, the proposed algorithms realize a closed-loop solution for lateral control problems from offline training to online fine-tuning, making it attractive for future similar RL-based controller to build upon. © 2024 Elsevier Ltd",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85207952177&doi=10.1016%2fj.engappai.2024.109588&partnerID=40&md5=bba22946143e746859a9c0a692149753,Engineering Applications of Artificial Intelligence,2025
3-D Autonomous Entry Trajectory Planning via Hybrid Action Reinforcement Learning,"In this article, by employing a modular strategy and hybrid action reinforcement learning (RL), an intelligent 3-D entry trajectory planning approach is proposed to achieve online autonomous trajectory generation for any initial location and target within a large reachable area. To reduce training difficulty and enhance task adaptability, the modular design approach decomposes the entry trajectory problem into the bank and angle of attack (AOA) modules. The environment, with complete 3-D state space and entry dynamics, is established to train both modules, in which additional performance requirements are incorporated in the reward design, such as suppressing long-period oscillations and reducing reversal numbers. In the bank module, discrete-continuous hybrid action space is adopted to formulate the bank angle decision problem, which determines the sign and amplitude of the bank angle simultaneously, effectively avoiding the tradeoff between RL exploration difficulties and trajectory accuracy. Specifically, dueling hybrid twin delayed deep deterministic policy gradient algorithm is proposed to address the hybrid action problem and hence to train the 3-D bank module. Subsequently, the AOA module is trained to adjust the AOA profile to meet flight capability requirements. The simulations highlight the ability of our proposed algorithm to achieve autonomous robust trajectory planning in expansive reachable areas.  © 1965-2011 IEEE.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85201615051&doi=10.1109%2fTAES.2024.3443776&partnerID=40&md5=3586cef1f955767969b0382b5b1babcc,IEEE Transactions on Aerospace and Electronic Systems,2025
A Practical Federated Learning Framework With Truthful Incentive in UAV-Assisted Crowdsensing,"The integration of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) and artificial intelligence (AI) has garnered significant interest as a promising paradigm for facilitating intelligent and pervasive mobile crowdsensing (MCS) services. In traditional AI methodologies, the centralization of large volumes of privacy-sensitive sensory data shared by UAVs for model training entails substantial privacy risks. Federated learning (FL) emerges as an appealing privacy-preserving paradigm that enables participating UAVs to collaboratively train shared models while safeguarding the privacy of their data. However, given that the execution of FL tasks inherently requires the consumption of resources such as power and bandwidth, rational and self-interested UAVs may not actively engage in FL or launch free-riding attacks (i.e., sharing fake local models) to mitigate costs. To address the above challenges, we propose a truthful incentive scheme in FL-based UAV-assisted MCS. Specifically, we first present a learning framework tailored for realistic scenarios in UAV-assisted MCS that enhances privacy preservation and optimizes communication efficiency during AI model training for collaborative UAVs, where the sensing platform (i.e., the aggregation server) is the finite-rational decision maker. Then, based on prospect theory (PT), we design an incentive mechanism to motivate UAVs to participate in FL. In this mechanism, a PT-based game is exploited to model the interactions between the sensing platform and UAVs, where the equilibrium is derived. Moreover, we employ a zero-payment mechanism to curb the self-interested behavior of UAVs. Finally, simulation results show that the proposed scheme can facilitate high-quality model sharing while suppressing free-riding attacks.  © 2005-2012 IEEE.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85207456734&doi=10.1109%2fTIFS.2024.3484946&partnerID=40&md5=c7dd1dda0610aa0d5496d09420e88cf5,IEEE Transactions on Information Forensics and Security,2025
Anomaly Detection and Secure Position Estimation Against GPS Spoofing Attack: A Security-Critical Study of Localization in Autonomous Driving,"For advanced autonomous driving (AD) systems, localization is highly critical for safety. Recent results show that GPS is vulnerable to spoofing attacks, and it is not clear whether the current localization is secure enough against advanced GPS spoofing attacks. In this paper, a systematic study regarding the security of the localization under GPS spoofing is explored for safe and reliable AD. First, a novel and robust GPS adversarial attack design method is proposed to defeat the principle of the multi-sensor fusion algorithm and lead to wrong position. It can cheat the widely used Chi-squared detector in Kalman filter and cause the vehicle to drive off the road, posing greater challenge on safe driving. Second, a real-time Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) attack detector is developed to detect the serious attack effectively. When the attack is detected, a multi-information fusion method based on the lateral direction localization from camera and map using Unscented Kalman filter is proposed to defend against the GPS attack and provide accurate position estimation for automated vehicles to drive on roads safely. The proposed method is validated in various scenarios in Carla simulator and a real-word driving dataset to demonstrate its effectiveness in timely GPS attack detection and secure position estimation. The results show that the LSTM-based detection method has best performance compared to the state-of-the-art detection approaches. The position estimation for attack defense is effective and robust in different driving scenarios, ensuring safe and reliable AD in closed-loop form. © 1967-2012 IEEE.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85203523108&doi=10.1109%2fTVT.2024.3454416&partnerID=40&md5=ea4d6b054cea94b82fcc8f5420f49230,IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology,2025
A Semantic-Consistent Few-Shot Modulation Recognition Framework for IoT Applications,"The rapid growth of the Internet of Things (IoT) has led to the widespread adoption of the IoT networks in numerous digital applications. To counter physical threats in these systems, automatic modulation classification (AMC) has emerged as an effective approach for identifying the modulation format of signals in noisy environments. However, identifying those threats can be particularly challenging due to the scarcity of labeled data, which is a common issue in various IoT applications, such as anomaly detection for unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) and intrusion detection in the IoT networks. Few-shot learning (FSL) offers a promising solution by enabling models to grasp the concepts of new classes using only a limited number of labeled samples. However, prevalent FSL techniques are primarily tailored for tasks in the computer vision domain and are not suitable for the wireless signal domain. Instead of designing a new FSL model, this work suggests a novel approach that enhances wireless signals to be more efficiently processed by the existing state-of-the-art (SOTA) FSL models. We present the semantic-consistent signal pretransformation (ScSP), a parameterized transformation architecture that ensures signals with identical semantics exhibit similar representations. ScSP is designed to integrate seamlessly with various SOTA FSL models for signal modulation recognition and supports commonly used deep learning backbones. Our evaluation indicates that ScSP boosts the performance of numerous SOTA FSL models, while preserving flexibility. © 2012 IEEE.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85209079319&doi=10.1109%2fTNNLS.2024.3441597&partnerID=40&md5=3313b1a38b6f62e3d7610908dcb50a50,IEEE Transactions on Neural Networks and Learning Systems,2025
DSR-CAAP: A Novel Denial of Service Resilient Channel-Aware Authenticated Key Exchange Protocol Suite for SAE J1939,"The SAE J1939, a higher-layer broadcast communication protocol with ISO 11898-1 specification at its lower layer, has significantly impacted the automobile industry. However, the SAE J1939 frames lack authenticity and secrecy, rendering it vulnerable to denial-of-service (DoS) attacks. While current authentications establish keys among electronic control units (ECUs), they abort ongoing sessions to re-initiate fresh sessions. We present DSR-CAAP, a robust authenticated key exchange protocol that establishes session keys among ECUs without aborting ongoing sessions during DoS and adaptive DoS. DSR-CAAP offers channel-aware key establishment using a hierarchical-challenge response mechanism. It is provably secure under the random oracle model and verified using the Tamarin. The empirical analysis reveals that DSR-CAAP supports comprehensive security attributes with enhanced 3R (robustness, reliability, and resilience) and reduces bus load, communication, computation, and energy costs. Besides, simulation in MATLAB 2023a reveals that DSR-CAAP outperforms existing protocols in communication response time.

Improving Deep Q Network Based on Marketing Psychology for AUV Path Planning in Unknown Marine Environments,"Autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs) are commonly utilized in fields like marine environmental testing because of their adaptable and independent characteristics. However, the complexity and variability of the underwater environment present challenges for AUVs. AUVs need to safely and stably navigate through complex unknown underwater environments. The existing path planning technologies for AUVs in unknown marine environments face challenges, such as slow convergence speed and low success rate. In this article, a deep Q-learning (DQN) approach grounded in marketing psychology (MDQN) is suggested to tackle the challenges mentioned above. First, to reasonably allocate the exploration and exploitation abilities in DQN, a mathematical optimizer acceleration function is developed. Additionally, to improve the environmental adaptability of AUVs and speed up the convergence of deep networks, a reward mechanism that takes into account ocean currents and the shortest path principle is suggested. Finally, the reward feedback and experience stratification mechanism are designed based on marketing psychology principles, aiming to promote a virtuous cycle between the training process of deep networks and the learning process of the agent. Various simulation experiments comprehensively demonstrate that MDQN has excellent path planning capabilities in unknown marine environments, effectively addressing the slow convergence speed and low success rate issues of DQN.  © 2024 IEEE.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85208274197&doi=10.1109%2fJIOT.2024.3487129&partnerID=40&md5=38887fa6e09a2db389853b94865861ad,IEEE Internet of Things Journal,2025
Uncertainty and Noise Aware Decision Making for Autonomous Vehicles: A Bayesian Approach,"In the evolving domain of autonomous vehicles, the importance of decision-making cannot be overstated. Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) emerges as a pivotal tool in this landscape. However, existing DRL algorithms suffer from inaccurate Q-value estimation, predominantly due to system noise and function approximation errors. This coupled with real-world unpredictabilities, often misdirects autonomous vehicles, leading to sub-optimal actions and safety hazards. This work introduces a novel DRL algorithm tailored for uncertainty and noise-aware decision-making in autonomous vehicles.

Adaptive multi-granularity trust management scheme for UAV visual sensor security under adversarial attacks,"The big data provided by unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) visual sensors offers essential information resources for activities across various industries. However, various adversarial threats are inevitable throughout the lifecycle of data generation, transmission, and utilization, leading to serious security risks. Trust assessment of visual sensors is a prerequisite for securing UAVs, but the multidimensionality of the trust elements and the uncertainty of the evidence limit its practical application. To advance this research, we innovatively propose a trust management scheme based on multi-granularity evidence fusion within the framework of belief functions (BFs) theory to adaptively respond to both known and unknown threats. We first propose a direct trust assessment model for known threats, which constructs multidimensional coarse-grained trust elements (MCTEs) and integrates multiple lightweight sub-models for basic belief assignment (BBA) to meet the need for fast response. Then, to address the unknown threats, we introduce pre-trained models to build multidimensional fine-grained trust elements (MFTEs) to construct trust recommendation models for indirect trust assessment for visual sensors. In addition, to accurately characterize the trustworthiness of visual sensors, we also introduce a BBA-weighted fusion method to achieve more reasonable trust aggregation by weakening highly conflicting evidence sources. Finally, to validate the effectiveness of the proposed method, we conducted a comprehensive trust assessment and security experiment on UAV aerial images. The results indicate that the proposed method demonstrates excellent performance and is beneficial for enhancing UAV security in adversarial attack scenarios. © 2024 Elsevier Ltd",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85204088813&doi=10.1016%2fj.cose.2024.104108&partnerID=40&md5=62d536fdb79da47f69e0dedc416fa24b,Computers and Security,2025
An Intermittent Anti-Competition Communication Mechanism-Based Formation Maneuvers for Internet of Unmanned Surface Vehicles,"The development of unmanned surface vehicles (USVs) technologies considerably promote the application of Internet of Things (IoT) in marine activities. However, frequently changed geometrical configurations and potential network congestion severely threaten system performance. Regarding this, this article proposes an anti-competition communication mechanism-based affine formation maneuver control (AFMC) scheme for the Internet of USVs. First, an auxiliary system is introduced to construct two-layer-based formation maneuver structure, i.e., localization layer and tracking layer. In the localization layer, an intermittent interleaved period event-triggered mechanism (IIPETM) is proposed such that each individual could enjoy interleaved communication periods. Then, by establishing a backstepping-based controller in the tracking layer, formation members will sail along a trajectory generated by the localization layer, thus forming the desired geometrical configuration. The proposed method can significantly reduce network throughput and improve communication efficiency even under intermittent network connectivity. Finally, theoretical analysis and simulations are performed to validate the feasibility of the proposed method.  © 2014 IEEE.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85206655264&doi=10.1109%2fJIOT.2024.3478784&partnerID=40&md5=29ee07f6058b240095c21b3f886c0c9f,IEEE Internet of Things Journal,2025

Adaptive sensor attack detection and defense framework for autonomous vehicles based on density,"The security of autonomous vehicles heavily depends on localization systems that integrate multiple sensors, which are vulnerable to sensor attacks and increase the risk of accidents. Given the diversity of sensor attacks and the dynamic changing of driving scenarios of autonomous vehicles, an adaptive and effective attack detection and defense framework faces a considerable challenge. This paper proposes a novel real-time adaptive attack detection and defense framework based on density, which can detect and identify attacked sensors and effectively recover data. We first develop a reinforcement learning multi-armed Bandit-based Density-Based Spatial Clustering of Applications with Noise (BDBSCAN) algorithm that selects hyperparameters adaptively. The Adaptive Extended Kalman Filter (AEKF) combines with the vehicle dynamic model on the localization system and extracts data features used for the BDBSCAN algorithm to monitor potential sensor attacks. If attack detection indicates possible system compromise, AEKF is further employed on localization sensors with anomalies identified through the BDBSCAN algorithm of the attacked sensors. To ensure precision and reliability, the data recovery incorporates a redundancy mechanism to apply a decision tree to select the optimal state estimation between AEKF and Extended Kalman Filter (EKF) to replace corrupted sensor data. To evaluate the effectiveness and adaptability of the proposed framework, we conducted 15,000 experiments using the real-world KITTI and V2V4Real datasets across various driving and sensor attack scenarios. The results demonstrate that our proposed framework achieves 100% accuracy and 0% false alarm rate in various driving scenarios for attack detection within 0.15 s, with a recovery time of 0.08 s. © 2024",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85206432411&doi=10.1016%2fj.cose.2024.104149&partnerID=40&md5=874f7e0b749864c339186af60599e579,Computers and Security,2025
Efficient Adversarial Attacks Against DRL-Based Resource Allocation in Intelligent O-RAN for V2X,"Artificial intelligence (AI) is projected to be a critical part of open radio access networks (O-RAN) to enable intelligence for connectivity management in smart vehicle-to-everything (V2X) networks and vehicle road cooperation systems. However, the openness and dependence of AI models on massive volumes of data render them subject to serious security vulnerabilities, such as adversarial attacks. This study investigates security issues in O-RAN's near real-time RAN intelligent controller (RIC), with an emphasis on deep reinforcement learning (DRL)-based resource allocation. We introduce a novel attack manipulating environmental observations to mislead AI agents, resulting in erroneous allocations and decreased physical resource block (PRB) transmission rates for various vehicular communications. We also discover flaws where compromised users or signal jammers can fake signal power to trick the AI agent's state observation. This can lead to a policy infiltration attack that makes the network performance drop significantly. Evaluation results show up to a 40% decline in user data rates, a 77.74% reduction in packet delivery rates, and significant disruptions in ultra-reliable and low-latency communications (uRLLC) services such as remote driving and connected automated vehicles. The policy infiltration attack causes a 20% increase in packet losses and up to 150% delay overall. The attack efficiency emphasizes the need for adversarial training in protecting AI-driven applications, which should be addressed in future O-RAN security specifications and AI-powered vehicular networks.  © 1967-2012 IEEE.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85205316743&doi=10.1109%2fTVT.2024.3466511&partnerID=40&md5=8357d17ef2d9ee8f4c4196ab36c913bc,IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology,2025
Designing Secure Location-Based Authenticated Key Agreement Mechanism in Maritime Internet of Vessels for Big Data Analytics,"Maritime communication, critical for global oceanic trade, faces challenges and opportunities with advancements in Information and Communication Technology (ICT). Traditional methods are susceptible to interception due to open channels, limited authentication, jamming, and other security risks. Securing vessel movements and locations in Internet of Vessels (IoV) is essential to prevent unauthorized data interception and tampering during transmission. We propose a ship authentication method using location-based secure keys to ensure the confidentiality of a vessel's whereabouts. The proposed scheme's robustness is validated through formal and informal security analyses, and formal verification using the Scyther automated verification tool, demonstrating its effectiveness against potential attacks in maritime networks. Comparative studies indicate that utilizing location-based keys maintains anonymity and untraceability without imposing significant computational or communication burdens. Experimental findings from comprehensive big data analytics and simulations using NS3 validate the scheme's feasibility and performance.  © 2024 IEEE.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85205015533&doi=10.1109%2fJIOT.2024.3468174&partnerID=40&md5=5e99dbe4c24606a6edec0b432ef8cd61,IEEE Internet of Things Journal,2025
A Platoon-Based Approach for AGV Scheduling and Trajectory Planning in Fully Automated Production Systems,"This article explores the management of automated guided vehicles within smart manufacturing systems, presenting an architecture designed to handle various stages in a fully automated production system. Trajectory planning is managed using a potential field controller, coupled with a time-of-arrival optimization for vehicles heading to shared resources, exploiting the concepts of virtual platoons. This approach optimizes arrival times at resources and minimizes energy consumption, prioritizing other elements directed toward currently available resources within the system. In addition, a decision-making algorithm schedules vehicles needing recharging due to low battery levels, ensuring uninterrupted production without overloading recharging stations and guaranteeing system efficiency. The proposed architecture is tested on three production orders of increasing complexity. Results demonstrate that the use of virtual platooning simplifies the dynamic trajectory generation of the potential field controller and, consequently, significantly reduces energy consumption and waiting times at shared resources, while reducing the variability on the production chain's makespan.  © 2005-2012 IEEE.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85207428394&doi=10.1109%2fTII.2024.3455413&partnerID=40&md5=b4924662fa8b7de87ae1a37636d52754,IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics,2025
SuRLLC: Secure Ultra-Reliable and Low Latency Communication in NOMA-UAV Intelligent Transportation Systems,"The ultra-reliable and low-latency communication (uRLLC) plays a vital role in road safety and traffic management of intelligent transportation systems (ITS). Integrating unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) and non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) has become a prospective strategy for uRLLC by separately establishing line-of-sight (LoS) link and simultaneous transmissions. The confidentiality and security of information transmission in the context of uRLLC faces serious challenges, due to the openness nature of the wireless medium. Different from traditional encryption methods, featured by high computing complexity and serious processing delay, physical layer security (PLS) exploits the inherent properties of the wireless medium to prevent transmitted messages from being eavesdropped. In addition, NOMA-UAV systems pose unique challenges for secure transmission due to potential stronger LoS channels between the source and the eavesdroppers. Therefore, in this paper, we investigate the confidentiality and security of a NOMA-UAV uRLLC system, under which an UAV serves two types of users with different requirements, i.e., secret users (both security and reliability) and public users (only reliability). Based on the tools of stochastic geometry, we address the challenges of secure communications caused by the mobility of UAV, and derive the closed-form expression of secrecy rate maximization, a key metric for observing the key system parameters on the security and reliability. Furthermore, joint design of UAV trajectory and transmit power is proposed to enhance the system security. Finally, compared with popular PLS scheme empowered by UAV trajectory design, the proposed scheme is evaluated by numerical simulations for theoretical analyses and effectiveness in practice. © 1967-2012 IEEE.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85204168397&doi=10.1109%2fTVT.2024.3456122&partnerID=40&md5=172d880aed14b59276e9025de61c84f8,IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology,2025
Perception-Aware-Based UAV Trajectory Planner via Generative Adversarial Self-Imitation Learning From Demonstrations,"The use of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) for Internet of Things applications, like intelligent monitoring and search, is increasingly becoming a popular research focus globally. While various optimization algorithms exist to plan UAV flight paths, they frequently compromise the quality of the planning path to decrease planning time. In view of the above problems, a perception-aware-based UAV trajectory planner via generative adversarial self-imitation learning from demonstration is proposed. First, a progressively growing discriminator is devised to prevent the policy network from being overpowered in early training stages, avoiding potential training failures. Second, the issue of homogenized strategic patterns among optimized expert trajectories is solved by incorporating successful trajectories from the policy network into the expert buffer, which thereby enhances the network's generalization capabilities. Third, to address the challenges of skewed distribution and considerable performance variation among the strategies learned by the policy network during training, a class-level instance-balancing expert buffer is introduced. Finally, the yaw angle of the UAV in real time during flight is obtained by using the analytical solution of the position trajectory and yaw angle and the position trajectory output from the policy network. Experiments confirm our proposed method achieves comparable flight costs and success rates to those of the reference expert method, while the planning time is reduced. The proposed method is also shown to be well adapted to dynamic environments and obstacle trajectories, which are not involved in training. Additionally, the ablation studies highlight the individual contributions of each component within the proposed method.  © 2014 IEEE.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85206902901&doi=10.1109%2fJIOT.2024.3477450&partnerID=40&md5=c3225963148121e60401da10b441e864,IEEE Internet of Things Journal,2025
Fuzzing drones for anomaly detection: A systematic literature review,"Drones, also referred to as Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs), are becoming popular today due to their uses in different fields and recent technological advancements which provide easy control of UAVs via mobile apps. However, UAVs may contain vulnerabilities or software bugs that cause serious safety and security concerns. For example, the communication protocol used by the UAV may contain authentication and authorization vulnerabilities, which may be exploited by attackers to gain remote access over the UAV. Drones must therefore undergo extensive testing before being released or deployed to identify and fix any software bugs or security vulnerabilities. Fuzzing is one commonly used technique for finding bugs and vulnerabilities in software programs and protocols. This article reviews various approaches where fuzzing is applied to detect bugs and vulnerabilities in UAVs. Our goal is to assess the current state-of-the-art fuzzing approaches for UAVs, which are yet to be explored in the literature. We identified open challenges that call for further research to improve the current state-of-the-art. © 2024 Elsevier Ltd",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85207693154&doi=10.1016%2fj.cose.2024.104157&partnerID=40&md5=33c03173bd5f6fe6ab951fc6c474670a,Computers and Security,2025

Joint Beamforming and Power Allocation Strategy for NOMA Empowered ISAC Systems,"The emerging integrated sensing and communication paradigm has gained considerable recent attention due to its potential for supporting sensing and communication services simultaneously. To provide low-latency communication services for multiple communication users while sensing an unmanned aerial vehicle simultaneously, a non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) empowered integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) system is developed in this paper. To support the NOMA-empowered ISAC system efficiently, a beamforming-based cross-layer scheduling scheme is designed, which exploits the traffic dynamics information at the network layer and channel state information at the physical layer. Under the cross-layer scheduling scheme, an efficient joint beamforming, power allocation, and rate adaptation strategy is obtained via a developed Newton's method-based algorithm and the linear programming formulation. With the aid of the proposed strategy, the average delay in the communication task can be minimized while assuring sensing capability. Besides, an optimal tradeoff between the average delay and the average transmission power in the NOMA-empowered ISAC system is uncovered, which is further demonstrated by extensive numerical results.  © 2024 IEEE.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85205440260&doi=10.1109%2fTVT.2024.3469397&partnerID=40&md5=bb9399386967fb4dde411d3832dd19ad,IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology,2025

We formulate a mixed integer linear program to optimize the first sampling rate of each device, second amount of data the UAV transmits and receives to/from a device, third position of the UAV over time, and finally the number of virtual machines used by devices and UAV to compute data. We also propose a distributed protocol to determine quantity using aforementioned points.

Moreover, the said protocol achieves a max-min rate that is 80% optimal.  © 2024 IEEE.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85207417649&doi=10.1109%2fTII.2024.3477550&partnerID=40&md5=3c72cdd1a1bcc9a3ad9577ae737e0a42,IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics,2025
A Champion-Level Vision-Based Reinforcement Learning Agent for Competitive Racing in Gran Turismo 7,"Deep reinforcement learning has achieved superhuman racing performance in high-fidelity simulators like Gran Turismo 7 (GT7). It typically utilizes global features that require instrumentation external to a car, such as precise localization of agents and opponents, limiting real-world applicability. To address this limitation, we introduce a vision-based autonomous racing agent that relies solely on ego-centric camera views and onboard sensor data, eliminating the need for precise localization during inference. This agent employs an asymmetric actor-critic framework: the actor uses a recurrent neural network with the sensor data local to the car to retain track layouts and opponent positions, while the critic accesses the global features during training. Evaluated in GT7, our agent consistently outperforms GT7’s built-drivers. To our knowledge, this work presents the first vision-based autonomous racing agent to demonstrate champion-level performance in competitive racing scenarios. © 2016 IEEE.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-105003754025&doi=10.1109%2fLRA.2025.3560873&partnerID=40&md5=a508276d61606306870d8d8bca2e3b72,IEEE Robotics and Automation Letters,2025
Asymptotic Leader-Following Consensus of Heterogeneous Multi-Agent Systems with Unknown and Time-Varying Control Gains,"This paper investigates the consensus tracking control problem for a class of nonlinear multi-input multi-output (MIMO) heterogeneous multi-agent systems (HMASs), where the dimension of the dynamics of each agent is allowed to be different from each other. In addition, the control gain matrices (CGMs) with unknown time-varying coefficients and actuator faults with unpredictable jumps are also involved in the considered MIMO HMASs, all of which would cause damage for the system performance. First, a novel distributed auxiliary filter by feat of time-varying technology is introduced, which allows the zero-error estimation for the desired trajectory to be achieved and the asymptotic consensus tracking result to be further realized. Then, a cooperative adaptive control solution is proposed to ensure the asymptotical consensus tracking control result, in spite of the inherent unknown time-varying coefficients, unpredictable jumps caused by the unknown actuator faults, unknown disturbances and uncertain system parameters, distinguishing itself from those existing cooperative control works for HMASs where only ultimately uniformly bounded (UUB) result is derived. This is achieved mainly by the introduction of a series of Nussbaum functions and the employment of the adaptive estimation techniques. The effectiveness of the proposed control algorithm is confirmed by the simulation conducted on a group of HMASs involving unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) and autonomous surface vessels (ASVs). Note to Practitioners - In large-scale complex communication networks, uncertain HMASs with different structures and functions are capable of exchanging information and collaborating with each other to accomplish more complex and diverse tasks. Simultaneously, the probability of actuator faults within the HMASs increases dramatically, and the fault of a single agent may evolve into the failure of the whole system. Thus, the safety and reliability of HMASs are extremely important. Additionally, the control direction (the symbol of control gain) caused by both CGMs with coupling property of MIMO systems and actuator faults with unpredictable jumps, may not be guaranteed to be known in practical application, such as ship autopilot systems or uncalibrated visual servoing. This will have a considerable influence on the system's control performance. On account of the threat of nonlinear uncertainties, and unknown control direction yield CGMs and actuator faults to HMASs, an adaptive fault-tolerant control solution based on an effective distributed time-varying auxiliary filter, is developed for MIMO HMASs to guarantee the asymptotical consensus tracking control result. Further, the proposed control scheme has been illustrated to be feasible through simulation experiment conducted on a group of HMASs consisting of UAVs and ASVs.  © 2004-2012 IEEE.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85190728775&doi=10.1109%2fTASE.2024.3384400&partnerID=40&md5=d8b724150ace434a606ff30540b4883a,IEEE Transactions on Automation Science and Engineering,2025
Resilient Human-in-the-Loop Formation-Tracking of Multi-UAV Systems Against Byzantine Attacks,"This study addresses resilient human-in-the-loop (HiTL) formation-tracking of multi-UAV systems against f-local Byzantine attacks. In the HiTL settings, a human operator plays a key role in detecting any physical hazard, monitoring the whole UAV swarm, and sending secure execution signals to a non-autonomous leader UAV. Moreover, there exists a fraction of Byzantine UAVs in the multi-UAV systems, which propagate incorrect information to their neighbors (called Byzantine edge attacks (BEAs)) and adopt false input signals (called Byzantine node attacks (BNAs)) when swarming. In order to suppress the above aggressive Byzantine attacks, this paper proposes a Byzantine-resilient hierarchical control scheme, including a virtual Digital Twin Layer (DTL) apart from a Cyber-Physical Layer (CPL). First, a distributed resilient estimation scheme is proposed on the DTL, which can realize resilient estimation on the state of the non-autonomous leader UAV against BEAs on the premise that the DTL topology is strongly (2f+1) -robust. Second, a series of decentralized and chattering-free controllers is formulated on the CPL, which is resilient to both BNAs and inter-layered faults. The asymptotical control performance of the above controllers is strictly proven based on Cromwell-Bellman Lemma. To demonstrate the practicality of the theoretical results, a resilient HiTL multi-UAV systems experiment has been further conducted. The experimental results verify the effectiveness and practicality of the designed two-layered controllers against f-local Byzantine attacks.Note to Practitioners - Owing to the wide application of multi-UAV systems, the resilience of the whole swarm against malicious attacks has grasped the great attention of both academia and industry. This work considers a rather aggressive kind of attacks, named Byzantine attacks, where a fraction of unidentified UAVs act as traitors. Inspired by the digital twin technology, a two-layered control architecture for multi-UAV systems is formatted, including a Digital Twin Layer (DTL) and a Cyber-Physical Layer (CPL). Here are the highlights: 1) Control Architecture: The DTL handles Byzantine edge attacks (BEAs), while the CPL addresses Byzantine node attacks (BNAs), ensuring reliable human-swarm cooperation in adversarial environments. 2) Resilient Estimation against BEAs: A novel resilient estimation scheme on the DTL is designed, using edge-based feedback, which can estimate the states of the leader UAV manipulated by human operators. 3) Adaptive Controller against BNAs and Inter-layered Faults: On the CPL, a decentralized adaptive controller with adjustable and exponential convergence is proposed, enhancing its precision and flexibility. 4) Practical Application: A UAV swarm formation-tracking experiment validates the control architecture's effectiveness in human-in-the-loop scenarios, demonstrating its practicality in the realm of swarm robotics and human-swarm interaction.  © 2024 IEEE.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85194829721&doi=10.1109%2fTASE.2024.3400155&partnerID=40&md5=8fdf1deed08348d2c0d19bafe86c6c64,IEEE Transactions on Automation Science and Engineering,2025
Security and Safety-Critical Learning-Based Collaborative Control for Multiagent Systems,"This article presents a novel learning-based collaborative control framework to ensure communication security and formation safety of nonlinear multiagent systems (MASs) subject to denial-of-service (DoS) attacks, model uncertainties, and barriers in environments. The framework has a distributed and decoupled design at the cyber-layer and the physical layer. A resilient control Lyapunov function-quadratic programming (RCLF-QP)-based observer is first proposed to achieve secure reference state estimation under DoS attacks at the cyber-layer. Based on deep reinforcement learning (RL) and control barrier function (CBF), a safety-critical formation controller is designed at the physical layer to ensure safe collaborations between uncertain agents in dynamic environments.

Informative Trajectory Planning for Air-Ground Cooperative Monitoring of Spatiotemporal Fields,"This paper investigates an air-ground cooperative monitoring problem for spatiotemporal fields, such as air pollution, forest fires, oil spills, etc, with unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) and unmanned ground vehicles (UGVs). To fully exploit complementarities of these heterogeneous vehicles and improve efficiency of the cooperative monitoring, we design a novel cooperation scheme: each UAV is assigned to loiter over and transmit its observations to a pre-allocated UGV, and the UGV provides guidance on informative trajectories for the UAV and aims to reach a target position as fast as possible. Such a scheme brings challenges to informative trajectory planning of the UGVs, lying in the delayed observations from the UAVs and the cumulative information constraint depending on the unknown field. To overcome them, this work proposes a model-free reinforcement learning (RL)-based trajectory planning method to learn continuous policies for the UGVs, where a field estimator is designed for each UGV to recover observability of the field. In addition, we derive model predictive control (MPC)-based trajectory planners for the UAVs with tailored reference positions, where the uncertain tracking errors can be handled by the RL-based method of the UGVs. Thus, a performance coupling problem of the heterogeneous vehicles is tackled. Simulations illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed trajectory planning methods and the efficiency of the air-ground cooperative monitoring scheme. Note to Practitioners - This article is motivated by cooperative monitoring tasks with UAVs and UGVs in practical applications, such as environmental monitoring, search and rescue after disasters, etc. Due to the complex dynamics of spatiotemporal fields in these tasks, trajectory planning for the cooperative monitoring system is challenging and requires much computations. To resolve the issues, we propose a novel cooperation scheme in this article, where the large computational capability of the UGVs is utilized to solve a minimum-time trajectory planning problem under a cumulative information constraint, and the UAVs only loiter over and transmit measurements about the field to the UGVs. To achieve this scheme, RL-based and MPC-based trajectory planning methods are proposed for the UGVs and the UAVs, respectively. Simulations have validated the effectiveness of the proposed trajectory planning methods and good performance of the cooperative monitoring system.  © 2004-2012 IEEE.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85190171467&doi=10.1109%2fTASE.2024.3382730&partnerID=40&md5=5b1bd1a76bbb5bd8244b91fea760adb2,IEEE Transactions on Automation Science and Engineering,2025
Adaptive Fault-Tolerant Optimized Platoon Cloud Tracking Control for Heterogeneous Vehicles via Dual Learning Mechanism,"This work investigates an adaptive fault-tolerant cloud tracking control scheme for heterogeneous vehicular platoon systems (HVPSs) based on a dual learning mechanism (DLM). A human-vehicle-road-cloud traffic scenario is built, in which the cloud control platform operates HVPSs by sending the command signal to a non-autonomous leader vehicle, which generates the required trajectory. Moreover, a DLM consisting of an improved reinforcement learning mechanism and a composite learning mechanism is proposed to optimize the control performance of the entire vehicular platoon. Furthermore, unlike existing fault-tolerant control methods, the proposed DLM can effectively reduce the adverse effects caused by actuator fault. Via the DLM, and cloud control platform, an adaptive fault-tolerant optimized platoon technology is developed to guarantee the bistability. Finally, simulation results certify the effectiveness and superiority of the developed strategy.Note to Practitioners - This paper is inspired by the problem of vehicular platoon control, but the proposed approach is not only applicable to transportation systems, but also to a variety of scenarios such as smart grids, supply chain management, and fire rescue. The intelligent transportation system aims to realize V2P, V2V, and V2I. However, there still exist several problems, such as the lack of obstacle avoidance/collision mechanism, the occurrence of platoon actuator fault, and the excessive consumption of vehicle energy, making it difficult to apply in complex traffic. In this paper, the proposed method can effectively solve the above problems, and simulation experiments have shown that this method is feasible and superior. However, vehicular platoon path programming and external network attacks have not yet been considered. To approach the real traffic environment more closely also prompts us to conduct research in the future.  © 2024 IEEE.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85196121013&doi=10.1109%2fTASE.2024.3410642&partnerID=40&md5=2aa0ddd94475fafd26d744b1c3883bbc,IEEE Transactions on Automation Science and Engineering,2025
Adaptive Fuzzy Resilient Fixed-Time Bipartite Consensus Tracking Control for Nonlinear MASs under Sensor Deception Attacks,"This paper studies the adaptive fuzzy resilient fixed-time bipartite consensus tracking control problem for a class of nonlinear multi-agent systems (MASs) under sensor deception attacks. Firstly, in order to reduce the impact of unknown sensor deception attacks on the nonlinear MASs, a novel coordinate transformation technique is proposed, which is composed of the states after being attacked. Then, in the case of unbalanced directed topological graph, a partition algorithm (PA) is utilized to implement the bipartite consensus tracking control, which is more widely applicable than the previous control strategies that only apply to balanced directed topological graph. Moreover, the fixed-time control strategy is extended to nonlinear MASs under sensor deception attacks, and the singularity problem that exists in fixed-time control is successfully avoided by employing a novel switching function. The developed distributed adaptive resilient fixed-time control strategy ensures that all the signals in the closed-loop system are bounded and the bipartite consensus tracking control is achieved in fixed time. Finally, the designed control strategy's validity is demonstrated by means of a simulation experiment. Note to Practitioners - Currently, there are many practical application scenarios for nonlinear MASs, such as intelligent transportation, unmanned aerial vehicle cluster formation, etc. This paper investigates the adaptive fuzzy resilient fixed-time bipartite consensus tracking control problem for a class of nonlinear MASs under sensor deception attacks. In practice, these two situations are common: 1) The topology graph describing the communication relationship of nonlinear MASs is unbalanced 2) The nonlinear MASs is subjected to external malicious cyber attacks. Therefore, a novel coordinate transformation technique is proposed to reduce the impact of sensor deception attacks on the nonlinear MASs, and a partition algorithm is employed to implement bipartite consensus tracking control based on the unbalanced communication topology graph. At the same time, the nonsingular fixed-time control strategy can significantly improve the convergence of the studied nonlinear MASs. Furthermore, the nonlinear nonstrict-feedback model and backstepping design method used in this paper are general and practical.  © 2004-2012 IEEE.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85189628369&doi=10.1109%2fTASE.2024.3381568&partnerID=40&md5=2715f09473536cc3c4c66ffefad52abd,IEEE Transactions on Automation Science and Engineering,2025
Learning Cross-Modal Visuomotor Policies for Autonomous Drone Navigation,"Developing effective vision-based navigation algorithms adapting to various scenarios is a significant challenge for autonomous drone systems, with vast potential in diverse real-world applications. This paper proposes a novel visuomotor policy learning framework for monocular autonomous navigation, combining cross-modal contrastive learning with deep reinforcement learning (DRL) to train a visuomotor policy. Our approach first leverages contrastive learning to extract consistent, task-focused visual representations from high-dimensional RGB images as depth images, and then directly maps these representations to action commands with DRL. This framework enables RGB images to capture structural and spatial information similar to depth images, which remains largely invariant under changes in lighting and texture, thereby maintaining robustness across various environments. We evaluate our approach through simulated and physical experiments, showing that our visuomotor policy outperforms baseline methods in both effectiveness and resilience to unseen visual disturbances. Our findings suggest that the key to enhancing transferability in monocular RGB-based navigation lies in achieving consistent, well-aligned visual representations across scenarios, which is an aspect often lacking in traditional end-to-end approaches. © 2016 IEEE.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-105003680330&doi=10.1109%2fLRA.2025.3559824&partnerID=40&md5=3864cd13b1b45a51ad6740f0b73b5870,IEEE Robotics and Automation Letters,2025
Cooperative Active Learning-Based Dual Control for Exploration and Exploitation in Autonomous Search,"In this article, a multi-estimator based computationally efficient algorithm is developed for autonomous search in an unknown environment with an unknown source. Different from the existing approaches that require massive computational power to support nonlinear Bayesian estimation and complex decision-making process, an efficient cooperative active-learning-based dual control for exploration and exploitation (COAL-DCEE) is developed for source estimation and path planning. Multiple cooperative estimators are deployed for environment learning process, which is helpful to improving the search performance and robustness against noisy measurements. The number of estimators used in COAL-DCEE is much smaller than that of the particles required for Bayesian estimation in information-theoretic approaches. Consequently, the computational load is significantly reduced. As an important feature of this study, the convergence and performance of COAL-DCEE are established in relation to the characteristics of sensor noises and turbulence disturbances. Numerical and experimental studies have been carried out to verify the effectiveness of the proposed framework. Compared with the existing approaches, COAL-DCEE not only provides convergence guarantee but also yields comparable search performance using much less computational power. © 2024 IEEE.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85182351516&doi=10.1109%2fTNNLS.2024.3349467&partnerID=40&md5=979fc7de7baa29ae8de542d27b01cd1e,IEEE Transactions on Neural Networks and Learning Systems,2025
Attack-Resistant Sliding Mode Control for Markov Jump Systems With Redundant Channels: A Novel Two-Layer Mapping approach,"A security control problem is addressed for a kind of networked Markov jump system subject to two-side stochastic denial-of-service (DoS) attacks, in which the attack occurrence situation obeys the Markov chain. To resist the attack effects, a redundant channel protocol is adopted, wherein measurement/control signals are sent to the controller/actuator via the redundant channel when the primary channel suffers from cyber-attacks. According to the above redundant channel protocol, both measurement and input models are established to represent the received signals by the controller and actuator, respectively. Then, a novel two-layer mapping strategy via logical operations is proposed to describe attack occurrences and system jumping. These facilitate the design of a security sliding mode controller, under which the exponential mean-square stability of the networked Markov jump systems subject to DoS attacks and the corresponding sufficient conditions are derived. Eventually, the simulation results via the DC chopper circuit system are provided to illustrate the proposed redundant-channel-based security control method. Note to Practitioners - This paper is motivated by the attack resistance problem in networked control systems. With the revolutionary evolution of wireless communication technology, in many practical systems, such as smart power grids, unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), and unmanned surface vehicles (USVs), the physical devices including sensors, actuators, controllers, and other intelligent devices are interconnected and transmitted the data through a network infrastructure. The inevitable DoS attacks may cause reliability degradation of data transmission, which in practice results in shaky grid frequency, failed UAV formation, and inaccurate USV detection. Distinguished from the previous investigation results from a passive perspective, this paper proposes a redundant-channel-based method to solve the reliability degradation problem caused by DoS attacks from a proactive perspective. The developed redundant channel method against Markov-chain-based DoS attacks can improve the reliability of data transmission, and the proposed novel two-layer mapping strategy via logical operations can increase the freedom of security controller design. A DC chopper circuit is used to verify the effectiveness of the proposed novel control method and comparison simulation results show the advantages of the redundant channel method. How to improve the reliability of vulnerable channels is a knotty problem in communication. With the groundbreaking research of this paper, against other attacks, such as deception attacks, reply attacks, and frequency- and duration-constrained DoS attacks, the attack resistance problems via proactively strengthening the reliability of data transmission should be further explored in the future. © 2024 IEEE.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85189291875&doi=10.1109%2fTASE.2024.3379192&partnerID=40&md5=e843fe4d81ca215b46ac8019a55456a6,IEEE Transactions on Automation Science and Engineering,2025
Differential Game-Based Deep Reinforcement Learning in Underwater Target Hunting Task,"To meet requirements for real-time trajectory scheduling and distributed coordination, underwater target hunting task is challenging in terms of turbulent ocean environments and dynamic adversarial environment. Despite the existing research in game-based target hunting area, few approaches have considered dynamic environmental factors, such as sea currents, winds, and communication delay. In this article, we focus on a target hunting system consisted of multiple unmanned underwater vehicles (UUVs) and a target with high maneuverability. Besides, differential game theory is leveraged to analyze adversarial behaviors between hunters and the escapee. However, it is intractable that UUVs have to deploy an adaptive scheme to guarantee the consistency and avoid the escape of the target without collision. Therefore, we conceive the Hamiltonian function with Leibniz's formula to obtain feedback control policies. In addition, it proves that the target hunting system is asymptotically stable in the mean, and the system can satisfy Nash equilibrium relying on the proposed control policies. Furthermore, we design a modified multiagent reinforcement learning (MARL) to facilitate the underwater target hunting task under the constraints of energetic flows and acoustic propagation delay. Simulation results show that the proposed scheme is superior to the typical MARL algorithm in terms of reward and success rate. © 2012 IEEE.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85181558623&doi=10.1109%2fTNNLS.2023.3325580&partnerID=40&md5=f67980612307ed30c90deeb829c4abd8,IEEE Transactions on Neural Networks and Learning Systems,2025
Enhancing AAV-Based Industrial Systems With Cognitive IoT: Detecting AI-Manipulated Visual Data Using Graph-Based Methods,"The integration of Cognitive Internet of Things (IoT) sensors with autonomous aerial vehicles (AAVs) has transformed industrial sectors, such as monitoring, logistics, and infrastructure inspection. However, the advancement of visual synthesis technologies like generative adversarial networks and diffusion models has introduced significant risks by enabling the creation of highly realistic AI-manipulated content, making the detection of falsified imagery increasingly challenging. Existing detection methods, largely based on convolutional neural networks (CNNs), focus primarily on global image features and often overlook crucial relational connections, limiting their robustness and generalization. To overcome these limitations, we propose a novel dual-stream architecture that integrates global feature extraction with relational feature learning. By combining the CLIP model with a graph-based topology, our approach identifies hard-to-detect samples and processes them through a graph convolutional network (GCN) to capture both structural and relational information. Extensive evaluations validate the robustness and generalization ability of our method across various generative models and real-world perturbations. This approach offers a scalable and reliable solution to ensure data integrity in industrial IoT systems, helping to preserve societal trust in AI-driven applications. © 2014 IEEE.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-105004010769&doi=10.1109%2fJIOT.2025.3550125&partnerID=40&md5=86be3423065e6d6240595a4ff3fd62b3,IEEE Internet of Things Journal,2025
Density-Clustering Aggregation for Personalized Federated Learning With AI-Enabled Aerial and Edge Computing in UAVs,"This research introduces the density-clustering-based aggregation for personalized federated learning (DCPFL) algorithm, which utilizes DBSCAN clustering to enhance model accuracy in AI-enabled aerial and edge computing contexts, particularly for uncrewed aerial vehicles (UAVs). The DCPFL framework promotes model sharing among clients, fostering the development of personalized and optimized models. DBSCAN is beneficial in automatically determining cluster numbers using EPS neighborhoods and MinPts, with parameter optimization achieved through cross-experimental analysis. We further refined the model exchange mechanism by integrating a moving average prediction model to optimize the timing of these exchanges. Tests conducted on three public datasets covering two different machine learning (ML) tasks show that DCPFL surpasses existing methods, offering greater accuracy and enhanced adaptability in varied data environments. Implementing this algorithm in UAV networks leverages AI capabilities in aerial and edge computing to efficiently balance personalized modeling requirements with high performance, showcasing its potential to push federated learning (FL) forward in complex and dynamic settings. © 2014 IEEE.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-105003876018&doi=10.1109%2fJIOT.2024.3522164&partnerID=40&md5=63f8ef974d966151056c5fd71ec483b3,IEEE Internet of Things Journal,2025
Large Beamforming Models for Robust Wireless Transmission in Generalized Scenes of RIS-Aided Intelligent IoV Network,"In recent years, concomitant with the rapid advancements in large models (LMs) technologies within the field of artificial intelligence (AI), the domain of intelligent Internet of Vehicles (IoV) network has also experienced swift progress. Those potential applications such as autonomous driving, intelligent driver assistance systems, personalized driver experience, and traffic flow and urban mobility management are dependent on the excellent IoV wireless communications system. However, there still exist many fundamental challenges when involving LMs into IoV network. How to provide effective coverage for intervening massive heterogeneous terminals in complex dynamic wireless network environments is a challenging problem. Besides, the generalization and robustness of beamforming within various scenarios are the fundamental for IoV applications mentioned above. To address the aforementioned issues, we in this paper formulate and integrate LMs to achieve excellent hybrid beamforming within IoV wireless communications system which is aided by reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (RISs) and base stations (BSs) to provide additional channels and coverage gains. Benefiting from RISs, wireless channels become complex and reconstructable, thus providing the possibility of creating LMs based hybrid beamforming. The proposed LMs are formulated by utilizing deep reinforcement learning (DRL) to effectively interact with environments so that robust beamforming can be maintained within RIS aided IoV network. Finally, we exploit the excellent performance of LMs enabled hybrid beamforming and investigate the impact of critical learning parameters. Comprehensive experimental results have consistently confirmed that the proposed LMs enabled hybrid beamforming for RIS aided IoV outperforms traditional schemes in the respect of system throughput and network coverage under dynamic wireless environments.  © 2024 IEEE.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85193463447&doi=10.1109%2fTVT.2024.3401750&partnerID=40&md5=eea8d85abe6f5abf3b04b531b7ac643a,IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology,2025
Dual Agent Learning Based Aerial Trajectory Tracking,"This paper presents a novel reinforcement learning framework for trajectory tracking of autonomous aerial vehicles in cluttered environments using a dual-agent architecture. Traditional optimization methods for trajectory tracking face significant computational challenges and lack robustness in dynamic environments. Our approach employs deep reinforcement learning (RL) to overcome these limitations, leveraging 3D pointcloud data to perceive the environment without relying on memory-intensive obstacle representations like occupancy grids. The proposed system features two RL agents: one for predicting AAV velocities to follow a reference trajectory and another for managing collision avoidance in the presence of obstacles. This architecture ensures real-time performance and adaptability to uncertainties. We demonstrate the efficacy of our approach through simulated and real-world experiments, highlighting improvements over state-of-the-art RL and optimization-based methods. Additionally, a curriculum learning paradigm is employed to scale the algorithms to more complex environments, ensuring robust trajectory tracking and obstacle avoidance in both static and dynamic scenarios.  © 2016 IEEE.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-105003914905&doi=10.1109%2fLRA.2025.3560841&partnerID=40&md5=2201d7f9dbe57c61be642892f835ad6c,IEEE Robotics and Automation Letters,2025
Optimal Robust Formation of Multi-Agent Systems as Adversarial Graphical Apprentice Games With Inverse Reinforcement Learning,"This paper introduces a novel approach to solving robust optimal formation control problems in heterogeneous multi-agent systems (MASs) with disturbances. Our approach frames this problem as an adversarial graphical apprentice game problem, using the game concept and an inverse reinforcement learning (IRL) algorithm. This work innovates the derivation of unknown reward functions through demonstrations to achieve the desired formation. In addition, we define learner, estimator, and expert MASs as separate entities. This aim is achieved by introducing a model-based IRL algorithm with three stages of learning. After determining the optimal control of estimators in the first stage, the optimal control of learners is found in the second stage by using them. In the third stage, the reward functions of the estimator and learner MASs are updated in the inverse optimal control (IOC) stage simultaneously. Following that, we present an algorithm for model-free IRL that does not require knowledge of learner agents' dynamics and can reconstruct reward functions after observing online trajectories. As subproblems, both proposed IRL algorithms address optimal control and IOC. We analyze these approaches for stability and convergence and demonstrate that state reward weights are non-unique. Simulation results show the effectiveness of the introduced algorithms for a group of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs). Note to Practitioners - Designing an optimal controller is challenging in MAS, especially where we only have access to the optimal reference path. The challenge is compounded if we do not know the agents' dynamics and the appropriate reward function needed to achieve the desired path. This article proposes two IRL algorithms with the motivation to solve this problem. This study considers the optimal reference path for agents as expert MAS. Also, the MAS, we want to follow the desired path with the minor error, is represented as a learner MAS. The proposed approach is suitable for a large class of linear MAS since we have modeled the learner MAS with disturbance. Therefore, this method suits tracking, path-planning, and optimal formation problems in MASs. It requires minimal information but yields impressive results.  © 2024 IEEE.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85196117480&doi=10.1109%2fTASE.2024.3412188&partnerID=40&md5=00e51c0e4d4eb58bafe0d17e8e356e35,IEEE Transactions on Automation Science and Engineering,2025
DL-DRL: A Double-Level Deep Reinforcement Learning Approach for Large-Scale Task Scheduling of Multi-UAV,"Exploiting unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) to execute tasks is gaining growing popularity recently. To address the underlying task scheduling problem, conventional exact and heuristic algorithms encounter challenges such as rapidly increasing computation time and heavy reliance on domain knowledge, particularly when dealing with large-scale problems. The deep reinforcement learning (DRL) based methods that learn useful patterns from massive data demonstrate notable advantages. However, their decision space will become prohibitively huge as the problem scales up, thus deteriorating the computation efficiency. To alleviate this issue, we propose a double-level deep reinforcement learning (DL-DRL) approach based on a divide and conquer framework (DCF), where we decompose the task scheduling of multi-UAV into task allocation and route planning. Particularly, we design an encoder-decoder structured policy network in our upper-level DRL model to allocate the tasks to different UAVs, and we exploit another attention-based policy network in our lower-level DRL model to construct the route for each UAV, with the objective to maximize the total value of executed tasks given the maximum flight distance of the UAV. To effectively train the two models, we design an interactive training strategy (ITS), which includes pre-training, intensive training and alternate training. Experimental results show that our DL-DRL performs favorably against the learning-based and conventional baselines including the OR-Tools, in terms of solution quality and computation efficiency. We also verify the generalization performance of our approach by applying it to larger sizes of up to 1500 tasks and to different flight distances of UAVs. Moreover, we also show via an ablation study that our ITS can help achieve a balance between the performance and training efficiency. Our code is publicly available at https://faculty.csu.edu.cn/guohuawu/zh-CN/zdylm/193832/list/index.htm. Note to Practitioners - Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) are of great practical usage, as they have many real world applications. When a group of UAVs are employed to execute large-scale tasks, a core question is how to scheduling the UAVs, so that they could complete the tasks efficiently. However, it is a computationally hard problem due to the exponentially increasing search space. To solve this problem, we propose a double-level deep reinforcement learning (DL-DRL) approach within a divide-and-conquer framework (DCF), where the upper-level DRL model is responsible for the task allocation, and the lower-level DRL model is responsible for the UAV route planning. To better train the two DRL models who have interplay with each other, we propose a simple yet efficient training strategy, termed interactive training strategy (ITS), which includes pre-training, intensive training and alternate training. The experimental results based on instances of various scales show that our DL-DRL approach outperformed learning-based and conventional baselines, and the designed ITS could strike a good balance between performance and training efficiency. In light of those verified advantages, we believe that our DL-DRL approach has favorable potential to solve the practical task scheduling problem of multi-UAV in real world. © 2004-2012 IEEE.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85187270016&doi=10.1109%2fTASE.2024.3358894&partnerID=40&md5=970e576b166c82ff4092a0acf06ff2c2,IEEE Transactions on Automation Science and Engineering,2025
Algorithms for Cameras View-Frame Placement Problems in the Presence of an Adversary and Distributional Ambiguity,"In this paper, we introduce cameras view-frame placement problem (denoted by CFP) in the presence of an adversary whose objective is to minimize the maximum coverage by p cameras in response to input provided by n autonomous agents in a remote location. We allow uncertainty in the success of attacks, incomplete information of the probability distribution associated with the uncertain data, and varying levels of risk-appetite of the adversary. We present an exact cutting planes based algorithm to solve this problem and provide conditions under which it is finitely convergent. Since this approach solves deterministic CFP in each iteration, we also present improved exact method for CFP with p=1, approximation algorithm and heuristics for Multi-CFP with p≥ 2, and Multi-CFP with fixed tilt of the cameras. To evaluate the effectiveness and performance of the proposed approaches, we conduct computational experiments using randomly generated instances and simulation experiments where these approaches are utilized to find a hidden object in a remote location. Note to Practitioners - Telerobotic cameras have been widely used for a variety of applications in environment where it is tedious for humans to collect information such as surveillance, natural environment observation, search and rescue, satellite imaging, and many more. Therefore, computationally efficient approaches proposed in this paper for placement of view-frame of camera(s), by adjusting their pan, tilt, and zoom, will improve the effective utilization of a telerobotic cameras system. Additionally, before operating such systems in a military environment, a decision maker needs to analyze vulnerable cameras in the system whose disruption can significantly impact the information acquisition process. The algorithms presented for adversarial camera view-frame placement problem can identify the set of cameras (or vehicles carrying them) that are susceptible to attacks by a reasonable (risk-averse) attacker. Likewise, the proposed algebraic modeling framework and solution approaches are also applicable for planning interdiction actions to minimize the information acquisition by an evader/enemy. These results can be leveraged by autonomy solutions developed by the Army for both logistics (Autonomous Ground Resupply program) and combat missions (Combat Vehicle Robotics program).  © 2004-2012 IEEE.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85182950758&doi=10.1109%2fTASE.2024.3350973&partnerID=40&md5=d8b1c5fdf10c7130bd2f11b28720c6cf,IEEE Transactions on Automation Science and Engineering,2025
Robust Distributed Average Tracking with Disturbance Observer Control,"This paper is concerned with the study of robust distributed average tracking (DAT) algorithms for networked control systems in the presence of external disturbances or false data injection attacks (FDIAs). To eliminate the impacts of external disturbances and FDIAs, the technologies of disturbance-observer-based control (DOBC) and active disturbance rejection control (ADRC) are introduced into the context of DAT problems. First, for a class of external disturbances with known dynamics, we propose an anti-disturbance DAT (AD-DAT) algorithm, where a stand-alone disturbance observer based on the idea of DOBC is employed to estimate the disturbance and then to compensate it in the design of control inputs. The proposed AD-DAT algorithm can track the average of multiple time-varying reference signals with zero steady-state error and the accurate tracking is robust with respect to initialization constraints. Furthermore, for another class of FDIAs with unknown dynamics, we design an anti-attack DAT (AA-DAT) algorithm where the control input is based on the estimates of states instead of original states, and construct an extended state observer including a state observer and an FDIAs observer based on the idea of ADRC. The extended state observer plays a key role in estimating and eliminating the impact of FDIAs without compromising the accurate tracking performance. In addition, sufficient conditions are derived for the proposed two algorithms from a theoretical point of view to guarantee accurate average tracking. Finally, some numerical examples are given to illustrate the validity and effectiveness of the proposed algorithms. Note to Practitioners - This paper is motivated by the problem of robust distributed average tracking (DAT) for the time-varying centroid of the formation of a group of autonomous vehicles. The problem arises in the scenario where two groups of unmanned ground vehicles (UGVs) and unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) perform a combined surveillance-reconnaissance mission (where the UAVs aim to provide aerial coverage and early warning against threats for the UGVs, as shown in Fig. 1) in an uncertain environment where the external disturbances might exist or the FDIAs might be launched by adversaries. Obviously, the tracking accuracy of the target signal will be compromised in the presence of external disturbances or FDIAs. However, most existing works for disturbance rejection mainly focused on the static average consensus rather than the dynamic one even though a few works mentioned the DAT problem with only considering the case of external disturbances. Based on this, we propose an AD-DAT algorithm and an AA-DAT algorithm for the DAT problem based on the ideas of DOBC and ADRC, respectively. Numerical examples show that the proposed algorithms are able to estimate and eliminate the impacts of the external disturbances and the FDIAs, which implies that the algorithms can be implemented in practical scenarios. In future research, we will extend the results to more general scenarios in the presence of external disturbances and FDIAs. © 2004-2012 IEEE.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85184338064&doi=10.1109%2fTASE.2024.3357527&partnerID=40&md5=d7392ad23e1a9b318f0a097a957c81e9,IEEE Transactions on Automation Science and Engineering,2025
AoI and Energy-Aware Data Collection for IRS-Assisted UAV-IoT Networks Under Jamming,"With the rapid popularity of autonomous aerial vehicles (AAV)-Internet of Things (IoT) networks, timely and energy-efficient data collection is a critical issue. The strong Line-of-Sight (LoS) communication of UAVs makes them more susceptible to jamming attacks, resulting in increased communication latency and energy consumption (EC). In this article, the problem of jointly minimizing Age of Information (AoI) and EC in data collection under malicious jamming attacks is formulated by optimizing the diagonal phase shift matrix of the intelligent reflective surface (IRS), UAV trajectory, and the transmit powers of IoT devices. The formulated problem is solved by an alternating optimization (AO) scheme. Specifically, we first obtain the closed-form solution of the IRS diagonal phase shift matrix by using the quantitative passive beamforming method. Then, the UAV trajectory is optimized by the variable parameter particle swarm annealing (VPPSA) algorithm, and the suboptimal solution of the transmit powers of IoT devices is obtained by the successive convex approximation (SCA) algorithm. Extensive simulation results demonstrate that the proposed algorithm outperforms the benchmark schemes in terms of AoI and EC. © 2014 IEEE.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-105003872303&doi=10.1109%2fJIOT.2024.3519668&partnerID=40&md5=3f3ed36f8024f0d69b9d876656c4c11d,IEEE Internet of Things Journal,2025
CMTI: Non-Line-of-Sight Radar Imaging for Non-Cooperative Corner Motion Target,"Concealed moving target imaging is an important task in the fields of autonomous driving, urban combat, city anti-terrorism, etc. However, existing radar imaging techniques mainly focus on line-of-sight (LOS) targets and struggle to sense non-line-of-sight (NLOS) moving targets. In this paper, a joint NLOS model and inverse synthetic aperture radar (ISAR) algorithm, dubbed corner motion target imaging (CMTI), is proposed for moving target imaging via millimeter-wave (MMW) radar. In this scheme, initially, to separate hidden motion target echoes and background clutter, we utilize a low-frequency filtering method to suppress the clutter and an NLOS echo extraction method based on OTSU to extract the target echoes. Subsequently, to solve the problem of focusing and imaging difficulties, a novel NLOS imaging method based on the polar format algorithm (PFA) and the prominent point processing (PPP) autofocus algorithm is exploited. The method consists of a cross-correlation method and a minimum variance algorithm for envelope alignment and phase adjustment, the minimization entropy autofocusing (MEA) method and PPP for residual phase error and target rotational speed estimation, and PFA for 2-D high-resolution imaging. Eventually, to obtain the real target image, we present a reconstruction algorithm based on the mirror symmetry criterion. Near-field experiments are set up to verify CMTI. The experimental results demonstrate that CMTI can provide high-resolution images of the NLOS moving targets.  © 1967-2012 IEEE.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85192969131&doi=10.1109%2fTVT.2024.3398218&partnerID=40&md5=0a9c32d1611adc3e9de7292f5f7c270f,IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology,2025
An Information-Assisted Deep Reinforcement Learning Path Planning Scheme for Dynamic and Unknown Underwater Environment,"An autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV) has shown impressive potential and promising exploitation prospects in numerous marine missions. Among its various applications, the most essential prerequisite is path planning. Although considerable endeavors have been made, there are several limitations. A complete and realistic ocean simulation environment is critically needed. As most of the existing methods are based on mathematical models, they suffer from a large gap with reality. At the same time, the dynamic and unknown environment places high demands on robustness and generalization. In order to overcome these limitations, we propose an information-assisted reinforcement learning path planning scheme. First, it performs numerical modeling based on real ocean current observations to establish a complete simulation environment with the grid method, including 3-D terrain, dynamic currents, local information, and so on. Next, we propose an information compression (IC) scheme to trim the mutual information (MI) between reinforcement learning neural network layers to improve generalization. A proof based on information theory provides solid support for this. Moreover, for the dynamic characteristics of the marine environment, we elaborately design a confidence evaluator (CE), which evaluates the correlation between two adjacent frames of ocean currents to provide confidence for the action. The performance of our method has been evaluated and proven by numerical results, which demonstrate a fair sensitivity to ocean currents and high robustness and generalization to cope with the dynamic and unknown underwater environment.  © 2012 IEEE.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85178029122&doi=10.1109%2fTNNLS.2023.3332172&partnerID=40&md5=d6af1e4e6731d63e0ac4ca3875bc7e57,IEEE Transactions on Neural Networks and Learning Systems,2025
Hedonic Coalition Formation Game and Contract-Based Federated Learning in AAV-Assisted Internet of Things,"Coupled with the rise of Deep Learning, the wealth of data and enhanced computation capabilities of Internet of Things (IoT) components enable effective artificial intelligence (AI)-based models to be built. Beyond ground data sources, autonomous aerial vehicles (AAVs)-based service providers for data collection and AI model training, i.e., Drones-as-a-Service (DaaS), have become increasingly popular in recent years. However, the stringent regulations governing data privacy potentially impede data sharing across independently owned AAVs. To this end, we propose in this article a federated learning (FL)-based architecture that enables privacy-preserving collaborative machine learning across a federation of independent DaaS providers for the development of IoT applications. Specifically, this work introduces a novel incentive mechanism based on the hedonic coalition formation game to enhance the sustainable efficiency and stability of the FL system. By establishing tailored operational rules and functions, the proposed mechanism enables IoT sensing nodes to autonomously form optimal coalitions with AAVs, thereby ensuring robust collaboration. To deal with incentive mismatches and information asymmetry, we leverage the contract theory and propose a self-disclosure mechanism that guarantees truthful reporting of AAV capabilities while optimizing the global model owner’s profits. The performance-based AAV type is also defined to offer a practical measure for heterogeneous AAVs and serve as the foundation for fair and effective contract design. Simulation results validate the superiority of the proposed approach, demonstrating significant improvements in utility optimization and system stability compared to existing benchmarks. © 2014 IEEE.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-105004036445&doi=10.1109%2fJIOT.2025.3543917&partnerID=40&md5=b70520ed5916a71be76f110f241b2039,IEEE Internet of Things Journal,2025
Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning With Decentralized Distribution Correction,"This work considers decentralized multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL), where the global states and rewards are assumed to be fully observable, while the local behavior policy is preserved locally for resisting adversarial attack. In order to cooperatively accumulate more rewards, the agents exchange messages among a time-varying communication network to reach consensus. For these cooperative tasks, we propose a decentralized actor-critic algorithm, where the agents make individual decisions, but the joint behavior policy is optimized towards more cumulative rewards. We provide the theoretical analysis towards the convergence under the tabular setting and then expand it to nonlinear function approximations. Furthermore, by incorporating decentralized distribution correction, the agents are trained in an off-policy manner for higher sample efficiency. Finally, we conduct experiments to evaluate the algorithms, where the proposed algorithm performs competitively in both stability and asymptotic performance. © 2004-2012 IEEE.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85187022595&doi=10.1109%2fTASE.2024.3369592&partnerID=40&md5=8b3cd9aed5538283b7538a17c1f31571,IEEE Transactions on Automation Science and Engineering,2025
Fault Diagnosis of Labeled Petri Nets Under Attacks Using Integer Linear Programming,"This paper deals with the online fault diagnosis problem of discrete event systems under malicious external attacks. We consider a scenario where an attacker can intercept certain sensor measurements and alter them arbitrarily, potentially causing a diagnoser to malfunction. In the framework of labeled Petri nets, a novel integer linear programming problem is formulated by introducing binary variables to estimate the possible transition sequences of an observation that may have been tampered with by an attacker. The proposed approach makes two main contributions. The first one is that, by specifying two different objective functions to the integer linear programming problem, we can obtain the diagnosis results in the presence of attacks, which classic diagnosers may fail to achieve; the second is computational efficiency. In the absence of attacks, the proposed approach is experimentally verified to have lower computational overhead compared with the existing results that are based on integer linear programming and those using basis markings. Finally, the proposed approach is illustrated through a manufacturing system for assembling brake valves. Note to Practitioners - Fault diagnosis is critical for highly automated systems such as manufacturing systems, power plants and smart grids. Engineers are familiar with various fault diagnosis techniques in their community. However, malicious attacks in a system are not fully considered when performing fault diagnosis. This research elaborates upon a novel approach to fault diagnosis of discrete event systems modeled by labeled Petri nets, which can perform online fault diagnosis both in the presence and absence of attacks. The approach enables faults to be detected even after certain labels are tampered with by an attacker.

Deep Learning-Based Hybrid Dynamic Modeling and Improved Handling Stability Assessment for Autonomous Vehicles at Driving Limits,"This paper addresses the critical challenges of dynamic modeling and quantitative assessment of handling stability for autonomous vehicles (AVs). To meet the high safety standards in AVs, especially under conditions at driving limits, it is essential to employ precise dynamic models that match real-world system responses as closely as possible and provide reliable, quantitative evaluations of handling safety levels. We propose a deep learning-based hybrid dynamic modeling approach that integrates a designed recurrent neural network with vehicle physical models to enhance the traceability and interpretability of prevailing data-driven models. Utilizing recorded vehicle data, we first train the designed neural network to learn vehicle dynamic responses, thereby enhancing modeling accuracy. Then, the knowledge-based physical model and trained network model interact with each other and are mixed by exploiting the unscented Kalman filter. Furthermore, a comprehensive metric is developed to quantify the level of vehicle handling stability. We propose a multivariate dynamic representation to facilitate the analysis of complex vehicle dynamic behaviors. The mathematical definition of the handling safety metric is provided. Finally, hardware-in-the-loop (HIL) experiments are carried out to validate the proposed methods. Experimental results verify the effectiveness and better performance of the proposed hybrid dynamic model and handling safety metric. This work holds promising implications for accelerating the release and deployment of AVs. © 1967-2012 IEEE.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-105003236913&doi=10.1109%2fTVT.2024.3515209&partnerID=40&md5=8a936322498da8d315191d81355518b1,IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology,2025
Enhancing Federated Learning in Connected and Autonomous Vehicles Through Cost Optimization and Advanced Model Selection,"With the rapid evolution of vehicular network technology, the integration of Machine Learning (ML) with Connected and Autonomous Vehicles (CAVs) presents both remarkable opportunities and formidable challenges. This paper addresses the crucial need for efficient ML model training in the context of Federated Learning (FL) within vehicular networks. Recognizing the limitations imposed by the tradeoff between the high energy cost at the local level with the performance problem at the global level, we propose an innovative approach that harmonizes cost optimization with strategic model selection. Our strategy primarily focuses on optimizing energy consumption during model training and updating at the vehicle end, thereby resolving the prevalent issue of limited end-user participation in FL due to high energy demands. Additionally, we introduce an advanced model selection method, prioritizing local model uploads and adaptively allocating bandwidth to clients with more extensive training data. This method enhances the efficiency and reliability of model updates, ensuring robust global model performance. We validate our approach through extensive simulations, demonstrating not only improved learning performance but also a significant reduction in energy consumption among participating clients. © 2000-2011 IEEE.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-105003045222&doi=10.1109%2fTITS.2025.3546088&partnerID=40&md5=7c86fcc9b8b9022fbb49b03f22d75159,IEEE Transactions on Intelligent Transportation Systems,2025
Heterogeneous Topology-Based Event-Triggered Consensus Control of Autonomous Motorcade Systems Against Deception Attacks,"This paper investigates the consensus control problem of autonomous motorcade systems with heterogeneous topology (HT) considering deception attacks. First, an HT communication method is developed to optimize the information exchange of position, velocity, and acceleration data among vehicles, thereby enhancing inter-vehicle connectivity. To alleviate the burden on the communication network, a novel HT-based event-triggered mechanism is proposed. An HT-based event-triggered control strategy is then developed for autonomous motorcade systems to counteract deception attacks. Sufficient conditions for the HT-based event-triggered autonomous motorcade tracking are derived using Lyapunov stability theory. Finally, the effectiveness and advantages of the proposed control strategy are verified through numerical simulation comparisons. © 1967-2012 IEEE.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-105003020846&doi=10.1109%2fTVT.2024.3508253&partnerID=40&md5=2a1a9e6fe836d080459c2da4ff54a60d,IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology,2025
Safe Multiagent Reinforcement Learning With Bilevel Optimization in Autonomous Driving,"Ensuring safety in multiagent reinforcement learning (MARL), particularly when deploying it in real-world applications such as autonomous driving, emerges as a critical challenge. To address this challenge, traditional safe MARL methods extend MARL approaches to incorporate safety considerations, aiming to minimize safety risk values. However, these safe MARL algorithms often fail to model other agents and lack convergence guarantees, particularly in dynamically complex environments. In this study, we propose a safe MARL method grounded in a Stackelberg model with bilevel optimization, for which convergence analysis is provided. Derived from our theoretical analysis, we develop two practical algorithms, namely constrained Stackelberg Q-learning (CSQ) and constrained Stackelberg multiagent deep deterministic policy gradient (CS-MADDPG), designed to facilitate MARL decision-making in some simulated autonomous driving applications such as traffic management. To evaluate the effectiveness of our algorithms, we developed a safe MARL autonomous driving benchmark and conducted experiments on challenging autonomous driving scenarios, such as merges, roundabouts, intersections, and racetracks. The experimental results indicate that our algorithms, CSQ and CS-MADDPG, outperform several strong MARL baselines, such as Bi-AC, MACPO, and MAPPO-L, regarding reward and safety performance.  © 2020 IEEE.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-105003246174&doi=10.1109%2fTAI.2024.3497919&partnerID=40&md5=04cfb26cd3c477d6ff8b5352e26b200b,IEEE Transactions on Artificial Intelligence,2025
RaI-SLAM: Radar-Inertial SLAM for Autonomous Vehicles,"Simultaneous localization and mapping are essential components for the operation of autonomous vehicles in unknown environments. While localization focuses on estimating the vehicle's pose, mapping captures the surrounding environment to enhance future localization and decision-making. Localization is commonly achieved using external GNSS systems combined with inertial measurement units, LiDARs, and/or cameras. Automotive radars offer an attractive onboard sensing alternative due to their robustness to adverse weather and low lighting conditions, compactness, affordability, and widespread integration into consumer vehicles. However, they output comparably sparse and noisy point clouds that are challenging for pose estimation, easily leading to noisy trajectory estimates. We propose a modular approach that performs radar-inertial SLAM by fully leveraging the characteristics of automotive consumer-vehicle radar sensors. Our system achieves smooth and accurate onboard simultaneous localization and mapping by combining automotive radars with an IMU and exploiting the additional velocity and radar cross-section information provided by radar sensors, without relying on GNSS data. Specifically, radar scan-matching and IMU measurements are first incorporated into a local pose graph for odometry estimation. We then correct the accumulated drift through a global pose graph backend that optimizes detected loop closures. Contrary to existing radar SLAM methods, our graph-based approach is divided into distinct submodules and all components are designed specifically to exploit the characteristics of automotive radar sensors for scan matching and loop closure detection, leading to enhanced system performance. Our method achieves state-of-the-art accuracy on public autonomous driving data. © 2016 IEEE.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-105003294862&doi=10.1109%2fLRA.2025.3557296&partnerID=40&md5=69edcd3cd8dacbd44c003a6beb6dabd8,IEEE Robotics and Automation Letters,2025
Potential-Game-Driven Formation Control of AUVs: An Inverse-Reinforcement-Learning-Based Solution,"The formation control of autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs) is widely used to perform complex maritime missions. However, most works simply add all individual interests of AUVs together to achieve the formation task, which cannot reveal their interaction relationship and guarantee the full exploitation of formation interests. In this article, we are concerned with a potential-game-driven formation issue for AUVs. Specifically, a potential game-driven formation framework is first developed to formulate the decision-making procedure of AUVs, where the cost function not only reflects the common formation objective but also captures the self-interest. Based on this, the formation optimization problem of AUVs is constructed. To solve the aforementioned problem, an inverse reinforcement learning (IRL)-based formation controller is designed, whose aim is to maximize the formation benefits and drive AUVs to the desired formation shape. Besides that, the theory analyses, including the satisfiability of the potential game, the accessibility of the Nash equilibrium, and the convergence of the formation controller, are provided. The main innovations of this article are as follows: 1) the potential-game-driven framework can fully exploit individual AUV interests and enhance formation robustness over traditional cooperative frameworks and 2) the IRL-based formation controller has better environmental adaptability to the unknown underwater environment compared with traditional reinforcement learning controllers. Finally, simulations and experiments are conducted to validate the effectiveness of our solution. © 1976-2012 IEEE.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-105003167476&doi=10.1109%2fJOE.2024.3484525&partnerID=40&md5=44a2ef7b1cd381e5cfb0e493b381be93,IEEE Journal of Oceanic Engineering,2025
Defending UAV Networks Against Covert Attacks Using Auxiliary Signal Injections,"Unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) networks, which carry vital information, are prone to various attacks, and hence security issues are a major concern. In this paper, we design and implement a novel covert attack detection and secure control scheme, which operates between the UAV (the physical layer) and ground control station (GCS) (the cyber layer). Covert attacks can alter the UAV states, and yet cause the signals seen by the controller to appear unchanged, resulting in these attacks being more difficult to detect, and hence more dangerous compared to other types of attacks. To unmask the covert attacks, we construct and inject auxiliary signals to both the controller output and the UAV input. The auxiliary signals cause information of the attack to appear in the controller input, which is then fed to a detection observer to detect the attack. Next, we propose an integrated estimation and secure control scheme, comprising a reconstruction observer (which is a sliding mode observer (SMO)) that estimates the system states and attack signal, and an output-feedback controller that utilizes the estimated signals. We perform a series of transformations to the system, such that the design parameters of both reconstruction observer and secure controller are placed in a framework that is solvable using Linear Matrix Inequalities (LMIs). We also prove that the proposed integrated secure controller causes the output tracking errors to satisfy an H∞ performance index. We also rigorously analyze the system performance, and present the necessary conditions for the scheme to be feasible. Finally, simulations are conducted to verify the effectiveness of the proposed scheme. © 2004-2012 IEEE.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-105003038390&doi=10.1109%2fTASE.2024.3489609&partnerID=40&md5=7630d9468ebf6cf51da44e8132226ae0,IEEE Transactions on Automation Science and Engineering,2025
Secured Bipartite Consensus Control for Nonlinear Multi-Agent Systems Against Hybrid Attacks: A Component-Based WTOD Protocol,"This article studies the secure bipartite consensus control issue for a nonlinear multi-agent system (MAS) subjected to hybrid attacks. The challenge is to simultaneously consider improving the bandwidth resource utilization of each agent and ensuring secure bipartite consensus. In response to the former, a component-based weighted try-once-discard (WTOD) protocol is proposed, which can save bandwidth resources by selecting the maximum component of each agent's measurement output instead of only a single agent's measurement output to transmit to the observer. Different from the previous work, which considered only one single type/channel attack, a unified hybrid attack model is constructed in which aperiodic denial-of-service (DoS) attacks and unknown false data injection (FDI) attacks occur simultaneously in the channels from sensor-to-observer and controller-to-actuator. At this point, a co-estimation strategy is given to estimate the state of agents and the FDI attack signals. Based on this, the observer-based compensation controller is developed to mitigate the impact of FDI attacks based on the feed-forward method. Meanwhile, a set of sufficient conditions is presented to guarantee the existence of such a resilient controller, which can further ensure the underlying system achieves ultimately bounded bipartite consensus. Finally, a simulation example verifies the feasibility and correctness of the proposed method. Note to Practitioners-Nonlinear MASs currently have numerous real-world applications, such as unmanned aerial vehicle formation control and intelligent transportation. Besides the collaborative behavior among agents, antagonistic interactions are also common in the real world. Thus, the research on the bipartite consensus problem would benefit the application of unmanned missions in complex environments. This paper investigates the secure bipartite consensus control problem for a class of nonlinear MAS under hybrid attacks. Notably, these systems are particularly susceptible to various types of cyberattacks. Therefore, it is crucial to mitigate the impact of cyber attacks on nonlinear MAS that rely on communication links for information transmission. To address the challenges posed by simultaneous DoS and FDI attacks occurring in two communication channels, this paper proposes a resilient compensation-based bipartite consensus control scheme for MASs to proactively mitigate the impact of attacks on system performance. Furthermore, a component-based WTOD protocol is proposed to reduce communication resource usage among agents, making the proposed control strategy easier to implement and more user-friendly for control engineers.  © 2025 IEEE.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-105003035211&doi=10.1109%2fTASE.2025.3534029&partnerID=40&md5=28a85b2b7f903881b06e7f58a4ecb859,IEEE Transactions on Automation Science and Engineering,2025
Semi-Supervised Underwater Image Enhancement Network Boosted by Depth Map Consistency,"Underwater optical images are a crucial information source for autonomous underwater vehicles during underwater development and exploration. When these vehicles are in operation, they need to capture high-quality images for information extraction and analysis and require depth map information from the underwater scene to maintain the vehicle's posture balance, obstacle avoidance, and navigation. However, the absorption and scattering of light in water result in low-quality underwater images, significantly affecting the execution of these tasks. In response to these challenges, this article proposes a physically guided, semi-supervised dual-loop network for underwater image enhancement. This network is designed to accomplish high-quality underwater image enhancement and depth map estimation simultaneously. First, the revised underwater image formation model is employed to guide a two-stage network in decomposing and reconstructing underwater images. The depth map consistency of the scene and piecewise cycle consistency loss are utilized to ensure the reliability of the image transformation process. In another loop, a self-augmentation module based on inherent optical properties is introduced to enhance the robustness of the decomposition network. A multimodal discriminator is incorporated to form piecewise adversarial loss to improve the visual quality of the images. Through extensive experimental evaluation and analysis, the proposed method not only demonstrates outstanding performance in underwater image enhancement and depth map estimation but also reveals the relationships between various physical quantities during the degradation process of underwater images, enhancing the physical interpretability of the neural network. © 1976-2012 IEEE.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-105003181659&doi=10.1109%2fJOE.2024.3487350&partnerID=40&md5=400193e9f688f4251a041d11f622ecd0,IEEE Journal of Oceanic Engineering,2025
An Improvised Certificate-Based Proxy Signature Using Hyperelliptic Curve Cryptography for Secure UAV Communications,"Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) have enabled numerous inventive solutions to multiple problems, considerably facilitating our daily lives; however, UAVs frequently rely on an open wireless channel for communication, making them susceptible to cyber-physical threats. Also, UAVs cannot execute complicated cryptographic algorithms due to their limited onboard computing capabilities. Balancing high-security levels and minimum computation costs is imperative when developing a security solution for UAVs. Consequently, several proxy signature schemes have been proposed in the literature to fulfill these requirements. Nevertheless, many of these solutions face the issue of high computation costs, and some exhibit security vulnerabilities that could not be more feasible options for UAV communication. Considering these constraints in mind, in this article, we introduce an improvised certificate-based proxy signature scheme (ICPS), which leverages the concept of hyperelliptic curve cryptography (HECC) to meet the security and efficiency requirements of UAV networks. The proposed ICPS scheme offers a range of notable features, including its ability to address key escrow and secret key distribution issues. The proposed ICPS scheme’s security hardness has been evaluated using the widely known security tool, the random oracle model (ROM), proving its resilience against known and unknown cybersecurity threats. Finally, this study conducts a performance comparison of the proposed scheme against existing schemes, emphasizing its outstanding cost-efficiency. Notably, the computation cost is measured at 5.3536 ms and the communication cost at 1120 bits, substantially lower than relevant existing schemes. © 2000-2011 IEEE.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-105003047621&doi=10.1109%2fTITS.2024.3524575&partnerID=40&md5=600edf991cf514d665eef9be7a52adc5,IEEE Transactions on Intelligent Transportation Systems,2025
Convolutional Neural Networks and Transformers-Based Techniques for Underwater Marine Debris Classification: A Comparative Study,"Marine debris poses a substantial threat to ecosystems and their inhabitants, representing a worldwide issue. It is crucial to understand the nature and extent of this environmental issue, given its widespread distribution and diverse nature. In recent years, aerial and underwater imaging has been extensively employed to monitor these debris. The classification of marine debris facilitates the identification of the specific types involved and is crucial for implementing preventive measures. Nevertheless, monitoring demands substantial human effort, indicating the need for automated and cost-effective methodologies. In this context, artificial intelligence has emerged as a powerful tool for identifying underwater marine debris, offering several advantages over conventional monitoring processes, such as manual visual surveys conducted by divers or the use of remotely operated vehicles. We evaluated deep architectures through transfer learning, utilizing knowledge derived from the ImageNet data set and applying it to the smaller data set, considering the limited availability of underwater marine data. While prior literature exclusively focused on convolutional neural network (CNN)-based architectures in their comparative study, this article additionally incorporates state-of-the-art attention-based deep architectures for classifying underwater marine debris. We utilized multiple training schemes for classifying marine debris, employing a data set sourced from the database of The Japan Agency for Marine-Earth Science and Technology, which comprises of a library of deep-sea images. The attention-based shifted window (Swin) architecture demonstrated the highest accuracy at 93.08% with relatively higher parameter count, followed by DenseNet121 with an accuracy of 90.99%. MobileNetV2, with the fewest parameters (2.26 M), achieved an accuracy of 84.91%. The comparative analysis in this study indicates that transformer-based models exhibited relatively higher accuracies compared to CNNs. However, the selection between CNNs and transformer-based architectures depends on multiple factors such as data availability, computational resources and marine environment. © 1976-2012 IEEE.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-105003202521&doi=10.1109%2fJOE.2024.3436769&partnerID=40&md5=3e088c61a915b192d84b8a45ff95b8be,IEEE Journal of Oceanic Engineering,2025
EPIC: A Lightweight LiDAR-Based AAV Exploration Framework for Large-Scale Scenarios,"Autonomous exploration is a fundamental problem for various applications of autonomous aerial vehicles (AAVs). Recently, LiDAR-based exploration has gained significant attention due to its ability to generate high-precision point cloud maps of large-scale environments. While the point clouds are inherently informative for navigation, many existing exploration methods still rely on additional, often expensive, environmental representations. This reliance stems from two main reasons: the need for frontier detection or information gain computation, which typically depends on memory-intensive occupancy grid maps, and the high computational complexity of path planning directly on point clouds, primarily due to costly collision checking. To address these limitations, we present EPIC, a lightweight LiDAR-based AAV exploration framework that directly exploits point cloud data to explore large-scale environments. EPIC introduces a novel observation map based on the quality of point clouds, treating the environment as a collection of small surface patches and evaluating their observation quality. It maintains and updates this quality using spatial hashing. By guiding the AAV from well-observed to poorly-observed areas, EPIC eliminates the need for global occupancy grid maps, while ensuring robust exploration and effective performance across diverse environments. We also propose an incremental topological graph construction method operating directly on point clouds, enabling real-time path planning in large-scale environments. Leveraging these components, we build a hierarchical planning framework that generates agile and energy-efficient trajectories, achieving significantly reduced memory consumption and computation time compared to most existing methods. Extensive simulations and real-world experiments demonstrate that EPIC achieves faster exploration while significantly reducing memory consumption compared to state-of-the-art methods. © 2016 IEEE.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-105003088896&doi=10.1109%2fLRA.2025.3555878&partnerID=40&md5=e4dc95ee408de0a83a313bc277fc376e,IEEE Robotics and Automation Letters,2025
Adaptive Ocean Gradient Tracking Using an Autonomous Underwater Vehicle With a Boundless Model,"This work presents a method for exploring a dynamic river plume boundary using an autonomous underwater vehicle with an on-board lightweight boundless model. The boundless approach is achieved by not constraining the path evaluations or the Gaussian random field to a predefined geographical area. In-situ decision-making enables targeted sampling of the ocean–river plume interaction. The data-driven and adaptive approaches provide the capability and opportunity to fully utilize the operational window for the vehicle. The method was developed using a simulated plume and vehicle, and results from simulation studies and successful field trials from the Douro River plume outside Porto, Portugal, are presented. The vehicle adapts its path based on the underway real-time assimilation of measurements, seeking to gain new information while not straying away from the front. Owing to the unpredictable shape and size of the river front, a model-based boundless method for adaptive sampling was constructed, generating potential waypoints as a function of the vehicle's position and the accumulated knowledge of the plume. Not bounding the spatial or geographical extent of the method allows for greater variation in plume shape and size. The river plume's extent is defined here as the area within the sharpest spatial salinity gradient, containing less saline water than the surrounding ocean. In the method, the depth of the sharpest vertical salinity gradient, or plume depth, is estimated using a 2-D Gaussian Process, where the plume depth is estimated from a dive and ascent envelope of the robot traversing the ocean in an undulating fashion. Computational efficiency is gained from the resulting low number of inputs to the Gaussian process, compared to the number of salinity measurements, ensuring rapid on-board adaption. The next waypoint is chosen as the first waypoint in a path that maximizes the weighted sum of uncertainty, estimated plume depth, and the absolute value of the difference between the current plume depth and the estimated river plume depth along the path. This encourages traversal of the plume in a fashion that enables the extent of the plume to be resolved in high detail. The data-driven method was field verified in the Douro River, proving the ability to track the river plume to balance exploration and exploitation behavior to maximize the information value of the mission in real time onboard the vehicle. © 1976-2012 IEEE.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-105003172440&doi=10.1109%2fJOE.2024.3484577&partnerID=40&md5=4fe2d33bb17049156904b079c4694a8d,IEEE Journal of Oceanic Engineering,2025
Resilient Tracking Control of Cyber-Physical Systems Against False Data Injection Attacks and Obstacle Avoidance,"In this paper, the reliable tracking control and collision avoidance problems for cyber-physical systems (CPSs) with false data injection (FDI) attacks are investigated. FDI attacks can significantly compromise the safety and performance of CPSs by corrupting control and navigation data. Safety is an important aspect of CPSs. Unmanned ground vehicles and aerial vehicles are important applications of CPSs. The dual challenge of maintaining system safety and stability under deliberate cyberattacks, while ensuring reliable obstacle avoidance in dynamic environments, remains unresolved in many current methodologies. These challenges are amplified in CPSs owing to their reliance on real-time data and their susceptibility to adversarial manipulation. The main objective of this study is to develop a resilient tracking control strategy that can effectively mitigate the impact of FDI attacks and achieve obstacle avoidance. We propose a novel framework based on the exponential control barrier function (ECBF) and a novel observer-based auxiliary signal approach that can ensure the resilience of CPSs against FDI attacks and obstacle avoidance. The effectiveness of our methods is shown through extensive simulations and physical experiments, which depict improved tracking accuracy and system stability in the presence of FDI attacks as compared with those of traditional control methods. © 2004-2012 IEEE.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-105003042724&doi=10.1109%2fTASE.2025.3546583&partnerID=40&md5=49ca843486d653ecc0f92896c013ef20,IEEE Transactions on Automation Science and Engineering,2025
Search-Based DNN Testing and Retraining With GAN-Enhanced Simulations,"In safety-critical systems (e.g., autonomous vehicles and robots), Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) are becoming a key component for computer vision tasks, particularly semantic segmentation. Further, since DNN behavior cannot be assessed through code inspection and analysis, test automation has become an essential activity to gain confidence in the reliability of DNNs. Unfortunately, state-of-the-art automated testing solutions largely rely on simulators, whose fidelity is always imperfect, thus affecting the validity of test results. To address such limitations, we propose to combine meta-heuristic search, used to explore the input space using simulators, with Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs), to transform the data generated by simulators into realistic input images. Such images can be used both to assess the DNN accuracy and to retrain the DNN more effectively. We applied our approach to a state-of-the-art DNN performing semantic segmentation, in two different case studies, and demonstrated that it outperforms a state-of-the-art GAN-based testing solution and several other baselines. Specifically, it leads to the largest number of diverse images leading to the worst DNN accuracy. Further, the images generated with our approach, lead to the highest improvement in DNN accuracy when used for retraining. In conclusion, we suggest to always integrate a trained GAN to transform test inputs when performing search-driven, simulator-based testing. © 1976-2012 IEEE.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-105003164031&doi=10.1109%2fTSE.2025.3540549&partnerID=40&md5=527b2915bb453a4a3e6b86d0340b00bb,IEEE Transactions on Software Engineering,2025
Integrating Reconfigurable Intelligent Surface and AAV for Enhanced Secure Transmissions in IoT-Enabled RSMA Networks,"Autonomous aerial vehicle (AAV)-enabled Internet of Things (IoT) exhibits great application potential with its wide coverage, flexible network topology, and diversified services. However, ensuring communication security and efficient spectrum resource utilization in multiuser access scenarios is challenging, given the open nature of AAV channels and the proliferation of communication devices in IoT. To address the above challenges, this article proposes a novel reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS)-aided AAV collaborative communication framework, where RIS-equipped AAV flexibly serves multiple users. In this work, a rate splitting multiple access (RSMA)-based secure transmission scheme is proposed, where the split public information serves both as useful signals and noise to disrupt eavesdropping. For the proposed scheme, a sum secrecy rate maximization problem is formulated and solved by optimally deploying the AAV’s location, designing the RIS’s phase shift, and power allocation. For this nonconvex problem with a couple of variables, we decompose it and form three separate subissues. Specifically, leveraging the successive convex approximation (SCA) and semidefinite relaxation (SDR) techniques, we first exploit an iterative algorithm for optimizing beamforming vectors and phase-shift matrix of RIS, and the optimal position of the AAV is obtained according to the deep deterministic policy gradient (DDPG). Then, we design an alternating optimization (AO) framework for joint solving. Finally, simulation results validate the efficacy of the proposed scheme in enhancing security, e.g., relative to the nonorthogonal multiple access (NOMA) scheme and benchmark scheme, the secrecy rate of the proposed scheme increased by 29.7% and 71.9%, respectively. © 2014 IEEE.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-105002576982&doi=10.1109%2fJIOT.2024.3523500&partnerID=40&md5=ac57d264679be486ec4bf278f9977429,IEEE Internet of Things Journal,2025
A Task-Centered Algorithm for AAV-Assisted Communications Based on Deep Reinforcement Learning,"Autonomous aerial vehicles (AAVs) can be harnessed to provide temporary communication resources and act as a relay to assist users in transmitting their tasks to an external base station or cloud. How to allocate AAV resources to assist users has become an important topic in AAV-assisted communications. Although existing studies have considered terrain characteristics, communication throughput and user equality, task properties have often been overlooked, which would impact the overall quality of service. Due to the multiple complex attributes of tasks and dynamic complexity of the environment, optimization often involves high dimensionality and dynamism, making it difficult for traditional algorithms to distinguish primary tasks and effectively transmit important information. We thus propose a multiconstrained nonconvex joint optimization problem modeled as a partially observed Markov decision process, which brings the resource optimization challenges of AAV communication resources. This article further proposes a deep reinforcement learning (DRL)-based algorithm named weighted-K-means-DDPG (WK-Means-DDPG). The innovation of this algorithm lies in the combination of the traditional Weighted K-Means algorithm and DRL algorithm deep deterministic policy gradient (DDPG) to solve the deployment and resource allocation problems of AAVs and improve the performance of the reinforcement learning algorithm. Simulation results show that our algorithm outperforms state of the art and baseline algorithms in transmitting important information and can be generalized to different size of areas, number of users, and number of AAVs.  © 2024 IEEE.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-105002568326&doi=10.1109%2fJIOT.2024.3509615&partnerID=40&md5=c9e98a2c48fea567df03ff5c5aad3ef8,IEEE Internet of Things Journal,2025
"Decomposition, Synthesis, and Attack: A Multi-Instruction Fusion Method for Jailbreaking LLMs","Large language models (LLMs) can transform natural language instructions into executable commands for IoT devices like autonomous aerial vehicles (AAVs), creating new development opportunities. However, safety concerns about LLMs translating commands into machine or program control instructions cannot be overlooked. Currently, jailbreak instructions used to test the LLM security are often restricted to specific modes or tasks, resulting in a lack of diversity and leaving some tasks unexplored. To address this issue, we introduce a multi-instruction fusion (MIF) method that can automatically fuse harmful prompts and various task instructions into jailbreaks. First, we adopt a reverse decomposition strategy to acquire sufficient supervised data for fusing harmful prompts and harmless task instructions into jailbreaks and construct a task instruction synthesizer based on it. Then, to determine the optimal instruction combinations in the vast combination space, we propose a representative-node-based selection strategy, ReNB, to rank and filter the instruction combinations on a few representative samples, thereby accelerating the identification of the valid ones. Experimental results demonstrate that MIF significantly improves the attack success rate (ASR), achieving over 90% on GPT-4o-mini, LLaMa2-70B, and Qwen2-7B models, outperforming the state-of-the-art (SOTA) baselines. © 2014 IEEE.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-105002382748&doi=10.1109%2fJIOT.2025.3525741&partnerID=40&md5=bc7939c6e87b158e27d9e40b8604dcaa,IEEE Internet of Things Journal,2025
Neural-Network-Based Event-Triggered Formation Tracking for Nonlinear Multi-UAV Systems With Switching Topologies Under DoS Attacks,"A time-varying formation tracking (TVFT) control method under denial-of-service (DoS) attacks is proposed for a class of multi-uncrewed aerial vehicle (UAV) system with unknown nonlinearity. The neural network approximation is utilized to mitigate the impact of nonlinear dynamics on the tracking performance. Meanwhile, the switching topologies are adopted to ensure the reliability of the communication topology. Considering the resource constraints of the system communication network, an improved integral event-triggered mechanism is devised to further decrease the triggering frequency in comparison to the traditional event-triggered one. By using the multi-Lyapunov function, the tracking error is proved to be bounded. Simulations convincingly demonstrate the effectiveness and merits of the developed TVFT and the integral event-triggered method. Note to Practitioners - Multi-UAV systems are widely utilized in both civil and military domains, with communication networks serving as crucial channels for information exchange among UAVs. However, these communication networks are often vulnerable to various types of attacks. Therefore, the control problems of multi-UAV systems under DoS attacks are of great importance. A switching event-triggered control protocol is developed for multi-UAV systems to facilitate effective formation tracking in the presence of DoS attacks. This protocol employs switching topologies to enhance the reliability and flexibility of the communication network. The improved event-triggered mechanism effectively balances the system performance and the communication consumption.  © 2025 IEEE.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-105002676585&doi=10.1109%2fTASE.2025.3539401&partnerID=40&md5=dc778ec5bbcf6b63fff38ee0577fbd05,IEEE Transactions on Automation Science and Engineering,2025
Generative AI-Augmented Graph Reinforcement Learning for Adaptive UAV Swarm Optimization,"Uncrewed aerial vehicles (UAVs) are essential for providing communication and computation services in disaster recovery scenarios where traditional infrastructure is compromised. However, challenges related to energy efficiency, real-time adaptability, coverage, load balancing, and safe navigation persist, particularly in dynamic disaster environments. In this study, we propose a comprehensive framework that integrates generative AI (GenAI) with graph neural networks (GNNs) to dynamically generate hover points for waypoint-based UAV navigation and realistic task generation based on environmental conditions. The GNN-based collision avoidance mechanism further ensures safe navigation by allowing UAVs to avoid obstacles and no-fly zones while coordinating with neighboring UAVs in real time. To optimize UAV swarm operations, we introduce a multiagent graph reinforcement learning (MAGRL) framework, enabling UAVs to maximize overall system utility by refining hover point selection, task allocation, and load balancing in response to environmental changes. A graph attention mechanism enhances UAV coordination, improving communication efficiency and decision-making. Extensive simulations show that the proposed GenAI-GNN and MAGRL framework significantly outperforms existing methods in task completion, energy efficiency, and overall system utility in disaster recovery scenarios. © 2014 IEEE.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-105002563787&doi=10.1109%2fJIOT.2025.3529904&partnerID=40&md5=6f8664ae905ca413cafc743db6ae355a,IEEE Internet of Things Journal,2025

A 5G Roadside Infrastructure Assisting Connected and Automated Vehicles in Vulnerable Road User Protection,"Road safety is one of the major concerns when considering road vehicles, with issues referring to both drivers and Vulnerable Road Users (VRUs) (e.g., pedestrians). The role of roadside infrastructures in augmenting VRU protection is gaining popularity thanks to the development of smart and connected sensing systems, which enable the detection of critical events and their forwarding to nearby Connected and Automated Vehicles (CAVs) by Vehicle-to-Everything (V2X) communications. In this context, the fifth generation (5G) of mobile radio networks is emerging as the communication enabler for advanced V2X services for CAVs. In this work we propose the design, development, and assessment on road of a 5G roadside infrastructure for VRU protection, performing an in-depth analysis of the single components and their integration into the service. More specifically, we present a Roadside Unit (RSU) capable to detect, localize, and track VRUs; a communication architecture that exploits 5G V2X connectivity for sending VRUs detections; a CAV with on-board algorithms warning the driver of the presence of the VRU and an Autonomous Emergency Braking (AEB) solution triggered by the 5G V2X architecture.

SECR: A Secure and Efficient Charging Reservation Scheme Based on Digital Twin in Vehicular Network,"Despite the rapid growth of electric vehicles (EVs), charging remains a time-consuming issue that requires effective management. An important solution uses digital twin (DT) technology, which acts as a virtual agent for EVs in the digital space. DT can analyze real-time vehicle data to develop optimal charging schedules and reserve charging providers in advance through the vehicular network, leading to more efficient charging processes. However, the vehicular network exposes the automated reservation process of the DT to security attacks. Additionally, there is a risk that the actual charging process may deviate from the scheduled requirements set by the DT, resulting in wasted charging resources. To address these issues, this article proposes a secure and efficient charging reservation scheme based on DT technology. To prevent malicious attacks, we first design a secure and privacy-preserving reservation authentication protocol using the extended Chebyshev chaotic maps, taking into account the computational resources of the EV. Furthermore, we develop a reputation mechanism to evaluate and incentivize the charging behavior of EVs. Formal verification and further discussions are conducted to show diverse security functionalities of the proposed scheme can be achieved. We evaluate that the proposed scheme outperforms existing schemes in terms of computation and communication overheads, while also assessing the impact of EV charging behavior on reputation and charging level. © 2014 IEEE.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-105002492394&doi=10.1109%2fJIOT.2024.3511132&partnerID=40&md5=166259c96c4db811a2c6a6a86199d667,IEEE Internet of Things Journal,2025
Secure Data Delivery With Certificateless Homomorphic Network Coding Signature Scheme for Autonomous Aerial Vehicle Networks,"With highly mobile and flexible-configurable, autonomous aerial vehicles (AAVs) are becoming crucial wireless communication infrastructures. To improve the reliability and throughput of data delivery for wireless networks, network coding, as a progressive technology, can be applied in AAV networks. However, network coding incurs a security problem called pollution attacks for AAV networks. Although homomorphic network coding signature can prevent pollution attacks, existing schemes are not suitable for AAV networks due to cumbersome certificate management, the key-escrow issue, or insecurity. In this article, we propose an efficient certificateless homomorphic network coding signature scheme for secure transmission of AAV networks, which can avoid certificate management and the key-escrow issue. Then our scheme is proven to be secure against adaptive chosen identity-and-subspace attacks in the random oracle model, thus our scheme can guarantee data integrity and authenticity to resist pollution attacks. We provide a performance evaluation for the proposed scheme and prior research, and experimental results illustrate the efficiency and feasibility of our scheme for practical application, reducing the verification overhead by 42.918% for a 72-dimensional data vector. © 2014 IEEE.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-105002683431&doi=10.1109%2fJIOT.2025.3543199&partnerID=40&md5=5e5d6d7e0abc4a7e1c46dcdf6fa5e967,IEEE Internet of Things Journal,2025
RobIn: Robust-Invariant-Based Physical Attack Detector for Autonomous Aerial Vehicles,"Autonomous aerial vehicles (UAVs) are widespread in Internet of Things (IoT) systems applications. However, UAVs suffer cyberspace security threats, especially physical attacks that leverage physics signals to deceive sensors, disrupt missions, and potentially crash the UAVs. Such attack detection demands not only guaranteeing detection accuracy and timeliness but also robustness. Prior studies consider physical laws (Invariant) to detect inconsistency, but they sacrifice robustness requirements of uncertainties and lack theoretical guarantees of detection performance. To achieve the sensitivity-specificity tradeoff, this article proposes RobIn, a Robust Invariant-based physical attacks detector design incorporating scenario optimization. The key idea behind RobIn is robustifying the invariant model via scenario optimization theory to ensure modality untouched and trustworthy detection. With an offline robustification scheme and an onboard detection algorithm, RobIn can balance attack sensitivity and robustness to uncertainties. We theoretically provide the detection specificity lower bound guarantees under highlighting sensitivity in finite scenarios. We evaluate RobIn in both four virtual and three real UAVs, achieving 96.2% detection rates and 1.6% false alarm rates against 6 types of existing attacks, with only 3.82% runtime overhead (on average). Moreover, we illustrate the resilience of RobIn against the worst-case attack. © 2014 IEEE.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-105002562832&doi=10.1109%2fJIOT.2025.3530095&partnerID=40&md5=4c5797cf101b70209364215f521bdf1b,IEEE Internet of Things Journal,2025
From Static Dense to Dynamic Sparse: Vision-Radar Fusion-Based UAV Detection,"Precise uncrewed aerial vehicle (UAV) detection over long distances is of crucial importance for guaranteeing the airspace security. Although deep learning-based vision detectors have been developed, they still rely on a large amount of hand-crafted fixed feature priors. The existing static dense-based detectors suffer from the severe mismatch and imbalance between the small size and the high mobility of UAVs. To solve the problem, a novel multimodal fusion-based dynamic sparse UAV detection framework is proposed. The framework reformulates the feature priors in a completely dynamic sparse paradigm by using the radar data. Based on the framework, a vision-radar fusion-based dynamic sparse network (Vira-DSNet) is proposed for more balanced and robust UAV detection. The Vira-DSNet exploits our designed dynamic sparse candidate generator and radar-guided semantic feature transform to generate a small set of customized high-quality object candidates and semantic features based on the radar data. Moreover, based on Hungarian bisection matching, our Vira-DSNet eliminates the post-processing and is completely end-to-end differentiable. Furthermore, the Vira-DSNet is deployed in our developed actual vision-radar fusion-based UAV detection system to evaluate the performance in the practical applications. Experimental results demonstrate that our Vira-DSNet achieves an average precision AP50 of 88.2%. It is also shown that the average recall AR1 of Vira-DSNet is higher than the state-of-the-art scheme by 10.1%, while maintaining the real-time performance. © 2005-2012 IEEE.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-105002765458&doi=10.1109%2fTIFS.2025.3560551&partnerID=40&md5=e976a1812fcf43c0595fdb46c86d4f82,IEEE Transactions on Information Forensics and Security,2025
A Dynamic Time Assignment Communication Mechanism-Based Formation Control for Internet of Uncrewed Surface Vehicles Under DoS Attacks,"The Internet of Things (IoT) application has significantly enhanced the operational efficiency and communication capabilities of large-scale networked uncrewed surface vehicles (USVs). Nevertheless, resource-limited communication relay stations and potential Denial of Service (DoS) attacks pose severe threats to the reliability and security of IoT systems. Given these challenges, this article proposes a dynamic time assignment communication mechanism (DTACM) for USVs to manage communication resources and maintain formation security. The DTACM categorizes USVs into distinct groups and ensures interleaved intergroup communication. This prevents excessive individuals from occupying communication stations simultaneously, thereby guarding against potential communication delays and packet loss. Furthermore, to assess the damage caused by DoS attacks, this study introduces the average dwell-time automaton and time-ratio monitor into a hybrid system. These tools facilitate the analysis of system stability and resilience under malicious attack scenarios. Finally, the theoretical analysis and simulation results show the effectiveness of the proposed control scheme.  © 2024 IEEE.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-105002573681&doi=10.1109%2fJIOT.2024.3510396&partnerID=40&md5=a96d2863f86c8f6daa4acd4b5c24de16,IEEE Internet of Things Journal,2025
Distributed Prescribe Performance Control Based on Adaptive Neural Network Strategy for Multi-AAVs Under Cyber-Attacks,"This article proposes a distributed finite-time prescribed performance (FTPP) control strategy with the adaptive neural network (NN) compound approximation method to achieve the cooperative control of multiple autonomous aerial vehicle systems (MAAVSs). The deceptive and injective cyber-attacks on sensors and actuators of MAAVS are considered. The attitude controller is designed based on the distributed backstepping law, by which the stepwise virtual control signals were designed to control the attitude states of the AAVs. The FTPP control scheme predefines the error boundary and the convergence time to constrain the cooperative tracking errors in a small neighborhood and the settling time. Then, the MAAVS are controlled to track the given reference trajectory rapidly. In addition, to obtain information on the actuator and sensor attacks, the NN method is synthesized with the adaptive law to approximate the attacks and alleviate the undesirable effects. The Lyapunov method was employed to analyze and prove the stability of distributed cooperative errors under AAV communication network described by graph theory. The conducted experiments verify the effectiveness and the superiority of the proposed control algorithm.  © 2024 IEEE.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-105002584696&doi=10.1109%2fJIOT.2024.3510546&partnerID=40&md5=3de37956b198c339379cdd512b1a1892,IEEE Internet of Things Journal,2025
Scaling Up Energy-Aware Multiagent Reinforcement Learning for Mission-Oriented Drone Networks With Individual Reward,"Multiagent reinforcement learning (MARL) has shown wide applicability in collaborative systems, such as autonomous driving and smart cities for its ability of learning through interaction. With the recent development of drone networks, researchers have also applied MARL to address the trajectory planning problems. However, the dynamic environment and the limited battery capacity are still challenging for using MARL to achieve efficient collaborative task execution. In this article, we propose an energy-aware MARL model as an attempt to tackle these challenges, leveraging deep Q-networks (DQNs) with individual reward functions driven by the task execution progress and the remaining battery of drones. We conduct a set of simulation studies for the proposed mode and compare it with the shared reward MARL (Li et al., 2022) to explore the impact of credit assignment in MARL. The results indicate that our proposed model can achieve at least 80% success rate regardless of the task locations and lengths. Similar to the shared reward mode, the individual reward mode can achieve a better success rate when the task density is high, and it can hit nearly a 100% success rate when task density gets close to 40%. The true advantage of our proposed model with individual reward is revealed when scaling up the environment. The comparison to the shared reward MARL shows that the our proposed model is more robust toward the change of the environment size and agent numbers. It can achieve higher success rate with fewer steps due to the clarity of the goal which improves energy efficiency even better.  © 2024 IEEE.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-105002557930&doi=10.1109%2fJIOT.2024.3511253&partnerID=40&md5=337fe1af321d4a642047563c105122f4,IEEE Internet of Things Journal,2025
Adaptive Fractional-Order Fault-Tolerant Coordinated Tracking Control of Heterogeneous Multiagent Systems Against Multiple Faults Under Deception Attacks,"This article addresses the issue of the adaptive fractional-order fault-tolerant coordinated tracking control (FO-FTCTC) for multiple unmanned aerial vehicles and unmanned ground vehicles with fixed-time prescribed performance subjected to actuator and sensor faults under deception attacks. Deception attacks disrupt the sensor network, making the output and state unavailable. To achieve the tracking control of the system, the coordinate transformation method is developed, in which the attack gains are considered and the compromised states are utilized to design a control scheme. Then, the fixed-time prescribed performance function (PPF) is illustrated to transform the coordinated tracking errors (CTEs) into another error variable so that the unconventional errors are limited to the prescribed range. Next, the sliding-mode surface is built by utilizing the errors and fractional calculus. In addition, the radial basis function neural network is utilized to deal with the unknown term. Based on the error, the adaptive FO-FTCTC scheme by utilizing the radial basis function neural network (RBFNN), fractional calculus, and fixed-time PPF with prescribed performance can be achieved, which can strengthen the system performance. Based on the Lyapunov function approach, all vehicles can coordinately track their desired references and CTEs can be bounded within the prescribed boundary. Finally, simulation studies are provided to verify the validity of the developed FO-FTCTC scheme.  © 2024 IEEE.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-105002589058&doi=10.1109%2fTAES.2024.3462370&partnerID=40&md5=b6314f9d1c7522418e2c9b63fe6c9280,IEEE Transactions on Aerospace and Electronic Systems,2025
IH-SESD: Modeling Information Hiding With Super-Resolution Enhancement and Significant Region Detection for UAV Networks,"The advent of unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) networks, renowned for their expansive coverage capabilities and heightened adaptability, presents a promising landscape for bolstering the efficacy of Internet of Things (IoT) data transmissions. Nevertheless, the integration of UAVs into IoT ecosystems introduces a spectrum of security challenges, notably data tampering, man-in-the-middle (MitM) attacks, and eavesdropping, which threaten the integrity and confidentiality of transmitted information.

Driving State-Aware Anomaly Detection for Autonomous Vehicles,"With the increasing popularity of autonomous driving systems (ADS) in autonomous vehicles (AV), in recent years, there have been many attacks targeting AVs and ADSs. Meanwhile, recent studies have attempted to improve the safety and security of AVs from different perspectives, and they mainly focus on the spoofing attacks against the sensors and the injection attacks against the vehicle chassis and actuators. However, direct attacks on ADSs (i.e., communication hijacking and malicious codes) remain inadequately addressed, and even worse, such attacks can cause AVs to make unsafe driving decisions rapidly. In this paper, we introduce DSAD, a driving state-aware anomaly detection framework designed to enhance AV safety and security by identifying ADS attacks, such as communication hijacking and malicious codes, through chassis states. First, DSAD models ADS operations (i.e., driving states) as a two-layer state machine, utilizing real-time chassis data to infer driving states and detect anomalies in ADS outputs. This reduces false positives and negatives by aligning detection with the diverse operational modes of AVs. To achieve this, we develop a prototype system, DSAD, incorporating a Detection Policy Update mechanism that dynamically adjusts detection policies based on the vehicle's driving states, such as lane changing and obstacle avoidance. Second, DSAD considers both collision avoidance and control stability, addressing potential conflicts through hard and soft requirements. Furthermore, DSAD integrates a fault handling module compatible with existing autonomous driving fault handling mechanisms, ensuring timely response to detected anomalies. We develop a prototype anomaly detection system called DSAD and deploy it on four ADSs. We evaluate DSAD using various attack scenarios, and the results show that DSAD can identify over 90% of attacks on ADSs.  © 2005-2012 IEEE.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-105002492590&doi=10.1109%2fTIFS.2025.3553370&partnerID=40&md5=33e618dd6bd98c3033dd1507652afdaa,IEEE Transactions on Information Forensics and Security,2025
A Super-Resolution Method Based on Iterative Weighted Atomic Norm Minimization for UAV Swarms,"Uncrewed aerial vehicle (UAV) swarms have the characteristics of small size, high density, and agile maneuverability. These attributes have given rise to substantial difficulties for radar in achieving precise detection and resolution of UAV swarms. Meanwhile, their potential malicious use poses a significant threat to national security, making accurate identification of UAV swarms of utmost importance. This article presents a super-resolution method for UAV swarms that integrate the coherent long-time integration technique with the gridless sparse recovery method based on iterative weighted atomic norm minimization (IW-ANM). In the method, a framework for UAV swarm detection and super-resolution processing is first established. Then, based on the framework, the IW-ANM algorithm is proposed. This algorithm encodes prior information into the Toeplitz constraint matrix, adopts a well-designed weight function, and finally super-resolves UAV swarms in the spatial dimension through iterative weighting. Numerical simulations demonstrate that, compared with the reweighted atomic norm minimization, ANM, multiple signal classification, and so on, the proposed IW-ANM algorithm is more practical and robust, and has a better super-resolution performance in conditions of low signal-to-noise ratio, high-density swarms, and small angle intervals. Furthermore, a real experiment is conducted to validate the effectiveness of the proposed IW-ANM. © 1965-2011 IEEE.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-105002586679&doi=10.1109%2fTAES.2024.3509832&partnerID=40&md5=35cb3b2b33c53239a06d52e08135cc8f,IEEE Transactions on Aerospace and Electronic Systems,2025
A Radar System With Adaptive Waveform Selection Against Dynamic Spoofing Attacks,"With the spread of automotive radar systems, spoofing among the frequency-modulated continuous-wave (FMCW) millimeter-wave (mmWave) radars in autonomous vehicles (AVs) is becoming a severe issue. In this work, a dynamic spoofing attack scenario in the real world is constructed based on the fact that spoofing is a minority situation. Since conventional radars miss genuine targets in a spoofing environment and antispoofing radars perform far worse than conventional radars without spoofing, the separate application of both radars in our proposed scenario does not yield satisfactory results. To resolve this issue, we propose a cognitive radar system with adaptive waveform selection against spoofing attacks. First, an authentication mechanism and a quantitative model are constructed to detect malicious attacks, a process to be considered essentially adaptive cognition. Second, the appropriate waveform to be emitted is selected based on the results of the adaptive cognition module. To resist spoofing, we propose a waveform with joint frequency-phase modulation (JFPM) combining frequency hopping and phase coding. Based on the location of the frequency hopping, we categorize it into two schemes: intrachirp JFPM and interchirp JFPM. Finally, simulations and experiments demonstrate that our proposed system can accomplish target detection with relatively high accuracy in our scenario. © 1965-2011 IEEE.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-105002695509&doi=10.1109%2fTAES.2024.3499901&partnerID=40&md5=160e18fab3bd81971ffc14e5a9160c0b,IEEE Transactions on Aerospace and Electronic Systems,2025
Security Enhancement in AAV Swarms: A Case Study Using Federated Learning and SHAP Analysis,"As cyber-physical systems (CPSs) increasingly integrate physical and digital realms, securing critical infrastructure, such as the Port of Virginia, becomes paramount.

Dynamic Coordination of Multiple Movable Bridges and Vessels for Time-Efficient Inland Waterway Navigation,"This paper considers the presence of movable bridges in inland waterway transport, and presents a control framework for the joint dynamic coordination of bridge operations and autonomous vessel navigation to minimize waiting times of vessels at bridges. Simultaneous evolution of bridge occupancy and vessel position is captured by a control-oriented model that incorporates qualitative behavior in the form of propositional logic expressions.

Appropriate key performance indicators (KPIs) are defined and employed for a quantitative comparison with a mixed-integer programming (MIP) strategy with fixed opening regimes. Furthermore, sensitivity to the main MPC parameters is examined by carrying out extensive testing to assess the effect of each design parameter on the solution. © 2000-2011 IEEE.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-105001817437&doi=10.1109%2fTITS.2025.3528184&partnerID=40&md5=03fbce2e7a4fec2f34b2cd3bc1932f6a,IEEE Transactions on Intelligent Transportation Systems,2025
Noise Aware Path Planning and Power Management of Hybrid Fuel UAVs,"Hybrid fuel Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAV), through their combination of multiple energy sources, offer several advantages over the standard single fuel source configuration, the primary one being increased range and efficiency. Multiple power or fuel sources also allow the distinct pitfalls of each source to be mitigated while exploiting the advantages within the mission or path planning. We consider here a UAV equipped with a combustion engine-generator and battery pack as energy sources. We consider the path planning and power-management of this platform in a noise-aware manner. To solve the path planning problem, we first present the Mixed Integer Linear Program (MILP) formulation of the problem. We then present and analyze a label-correcting algorithm, for which a pseudo-polynomial running time is proven. Results of extensive numerical testing are presented which analyze the performance and scalability of the labeling algorithm for various graph structures, problem parameters, and search heuristics. It is shown that the algorithm can solve instances on graphs as large as twenty thousand nodes in only a few seconds. Note to Practitioners - The problem and algorithms proposed in this paper are relevant to constrained planning problems in general and specifically to those focused on widespread usage of small aerial vehicles in congested, urban environments. We are concerned here with the path planning of hybrid-fuel aerial vehicles in a noise-aware manner. This is motivated by the increasing usage of aerial vehicles, envisioning a probable future restriction on noise production in certain airspaces and the planning of such vehicles in those airspaces. We explore this novel problem, and present an approach to quickly find the optimal path and power plan in the presence of the noise constraints. The approach here is a discrete one, where the solution is a discrete set of edges and discrete generator settings which must be smoothed to obtain control inputs for a real system. The discrete approach allows solutions to be found quickly while giving up the true optimal trajectory that can be found when considering from a continuous framework. In practice, environment sampling and graph construction will greatly affect time-to-solve and as overall solution quality relative to a continuous approach to the trajectory and generator control. © 2004-2012 IEEE.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-105001587720&doi=10.1109%2fTASE.2024.3481998&partnerID=40&md5=b20654810221af5d70de0b7f1731e99b,IEEE Transactions on Automation Science and Engineering,2025
Multi-AAVs Flocking for Navigation and Obstacle Avoidance in Network-Constrained Environments,"The flocking movement is a fundamental and crucial operation in multi-AAVs systems, encompassing navigation and obstacle avoidance. However, traditional flocking algorithms typically rely on rigid rules and exhibit limited adaptability to diverse environments. Reinforcement learning (RL) effectively addresses this issue as a flexible and model-free framework. In this article, RL techniques are utilized to achieve navigation and obstacle avoidance for a swarm of AAVs. To enhance training efficiency, we propose an improved algorithm called heuristic guides TD3 (HGTD3) by integrating heuristic guides with the twin delayed deep deterministic policy gradient (TD3), aiming to address the protracted learning periods commonly observed in traditional RL methods. Considering the network-constrained environment, we propose the negative interference flocking algorithm (NIFA): The network interference flocking algorithm and an AAV flocking algorithm designed based on the sparrow search algorithm. NIFA can guide the losing AAV to follow the swarm and at the same time maintain the overall navigation and avoidance efficiency. Finally, we demonstrate the scalability and adaptability of HGTD3-NIFA in a simulation experiment in terms of multi-AAVs flocking and navigation.  © 2014 IEEE.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-105001878495&doi=10.1109%2fJIOT.2024.3507782&partnerID=40&md5=382e7851e25e5abe3eeaef073c09bcb8,IEEE Internet of Things Journal,2025
Event-Based Fixed-Time Secure Control for Multiagent Systems under Distributed DoS Attacks,"This article focuses on the leader-following consensus in fixed time for multiagent systems under denial-of-service (DoS) attacks. First, the node-based distributed DoS attack model is developed, where multiple adversaries launch different attack strategies working together on nodes of the system. Second, a novel fixed-time stability theorem is presented, where an index function is introduced to decrease the complexity of the stability condition and achieve the stability goal under node-based distributed DoS attacks. Third, based on this index function, the resilient dynamic event-triggered mechanism (DETM) is designed by utilizing the DoS attacks detection signals to reduce the consumption of computational costs and save the system resources. With the assistance of Lyapunov stability theory, some consensus conditions are established and the Zeno behavior is excluded. Finally, the autonomous swarm systems, including autonomous aerial vehicles and autonomous ground vehicles, are applied to illustrate the effectiveness of control strategy.  © 2005-2012 IEEE.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-105002291765&doi=10.1109%2fTII.2024.3508832&partnerID=40&md5=89bb5b54937aaf08a2ff31f9d1779bbd,IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics,2025
Cooperative Tracking of Quadrotor UAVs Using Parallel Optimal Learning Control,"The cooperative tracking control issue of quadrotor unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) is investigated, where a cluster of UAVs is required to maintain a preassigned pattern while tracking a reference trajectory. Since only a part of UAVs can access the reference trajectory, an adaptive distributed estimator is developed such that each UAV could obtain the accurate estimate exponentially. Based on the hierarchical development, a parallel optimal learning control strategy is proposed by introducing virtual artificial systems that generate the practical control commands. In particular, a saturated force command is exploited for the position loop tracking to the estimated trajectory and a torque command is utilized to ensure the command attitude tracking, respectively. Moreover, a data-based learning law is designed for the critic weight under the finite excitation (FE), which is made available for the inadmissible initial control. It is shown that the overall closed-loop system is uniformly ultimately bounded and the tracking errors eventually converge to small sets around zero. Simulation and experiment results further verify the proposed control strategy. Note to Practitioners - This paper is inspired by the cooperative formation control issue of quadrotor UAVs. In practical missions like surveillance and reconnaissance, a UAV comes into or leaves out of the cluster may lead to re-tune the control parameters for all the involved UAVs. To save the onboard resource, the communication topology among the UAVs cannot be tedious. The proposed parallel learning strategy is implemented as follows. First, we design an adaptive distributed estimator for each UAV that could obtain the reference information accurately. Then, we propose a data-based parallel optimal learning strategy for each UAV that tracks the estimated reference trajectory. Since the proposed strategy does not require any global information regarding the communication topology, the parameters can be remained when the UAV cluster needs to extend or reduce, which makes it more practical. Finally, the proposed strategy is validated by both simulation and experiment results.  © 2004-2012 IEEE.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-105002089381&doi=10.1109%2fTASE.2024.3391942&partnerID=40&md5=4254ccf91a3d5861e00d6a01a14551c3,IEEE Transactions on Automation Science and Engineering,2025
Generative Diffusion-Based Contract Design for Efficient AI Twin Migration in Vehicular Embodied AI Networks,"Embodied Artificial Intelligence (AI) bridges the cyberspace and the physical space, driving advancements in autonomous systems like the Vehicular Embodied AI NETwork (VEANET). VEANET integrates advanced AI capabilities into vehicular systems to enhance autonomous operations and decision-making. Embodied agents, such as Autonomous Vehicles (AVs), are autonomous entities that can perceive their environment and take actions to achieve specific goals, actively interacting with the physical world. Embodied Agent Twins (EATs) are digital models of these embodied agents, with various Embodied Agent AI Twins (EAATs) for intelligent applications in cyberspace. In VEANETs, EAATs act as in-vehicle AI assistants to perform diverse tasks supporting autonomous driving using generative AI models. Due to limited onboard computational resources, AVs offload EAATs to nearby RoadSide Units (RSUs). However, the mobility of AVs and limited RSU coverage necessitates dynamic migrations of EAATs, posing challenges in selecting suitable RSUs under information asymmetry. To address this, we construct a multi-dimensional contract theoretical model between AVs and alternative RSUs. Considering that AVs may exhibit irrational behavior, we utilize prospect theory instead of expected utility theory to model the actual utilities of AVs. Finally, we employ a Generative Diffusion Model (GDM)-based algorithm to identify the optimal contract designs, thus enhancing the efficiency of EAAT migrations. Numerical results demonstrate the superior efficiency of the proposed GDM-based scheme in facilitating EAAT migrations compared with traditional deep reinforcement learning methods.  © 2025 IEEE.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-105002332449&doi=10.1109%2fTMC.2025.3526230&partnerID=40&md5=7fb51c7d06246fe84fee684bd6748561,IEEE Transactions on Mobile Computing,2025
A Deep Reinforcement Learning Approach Using Asymmetric Self-Play for Robust Multirobot Flocking,"Flocking control, as an essential approach for survivable navigation of multirobot systems, has been widely applied in fields, such as logistics, service delivery, and search and rescue. However, realistic environments are typically complex, dynamic, and even aggressive, posing considerable threats to the safety of flocking robots. In this article, based on deep reinforcement learning, an Asymmetric Self-play-empowered Flocking Control framework is proposed to address this concern. Specifically, the flocking robots are trained concurrently with learnable adversarial interferers to stimulate the intelligence of the flocking strategy. A two-stage self-play training paradigm is developed to improve the robustness and generalization of the model. Furthermore, an auxiliary training module regarding the learning of transition dynamics is designed, dramatically enhancing the adaptability to environmental uncertainties. Feature-level and agent-level attention are implemented for action and value generation, respectively. Both extensive comparative experiments and real-world deployment demonstrate the superiority and practicality of the proposed framework. © 2005-2012 IEEE.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-105002337820&doi=10.1109%2fTII.2024.3523576&partnerID=40&md5=81920013d3dac3ab2413d4e9c09a72c5,IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics,2025
Secrecy Analysis and Optimization of UAV-Assisted IoT Networks with RF-EH and Imperfect Hardware,"This article introduces uncrewed aerial vehicles (UAVs) assisted communication system for energy-constrained Internet of Things (IoT) devices. Herein, a power beacon transmits radio frequency (RF) signals to enable energy harvesting at the IoT devices (IoDs). The source IoD utilizes harvested energy to transmit information to the destination IoD through multiple UAV relays. Among multiple UAV relays, a selected UAV applies a decode-and-forward operation to relay the information to the destination. An eavesdropper near the destination IoD poses a threat to information secrecy. Consequently, the selected UAV injects artificial noise to degrade the accessibility of the eavesdropper's link. For this setup, we employ a composite fading channel model by combining log-normal distribution for shadowing effects and Nakagami-m distribution for small-scale fading to evaluate system performance. Specifically, the compact expressions for secrecy outage probability and effective secrecy throughput (EST) are derived using the Gauss-Hermite quadrature method. Moreover, we conduct a tradeoff analysis between reliability and security by factoring in outage and intercept probabilities. Lastly, we formulate an EST maximization problem by optimizing the system parameters and UAV's locations under the outage and secrecy constraints. We propose a particle swarm optimization and continuous genetic algorithm-based hybrid algorithm for solving the nonlinear optimization problem. The numerical findings demonstrate that the proposed algorithm outperforms the baseline algorithms regarding the achieved EST.  © 2014 IEEE.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-105001839709&doi=10.1109%2fJIOT.2025.3540061&partnerID=40&md5=e907606c159dfe8a31ae29a6961bdefa,IEEE Internet of Things Journal,2025
Neuromorphic Attitude Estimation and Control,"The real-world application of small drones is mostly hampered by energy limitations. Neuromorphic computing promises extremely energy-efficient AI for autonomous flight but is still challenging to train and deploy on real robots. To reap the maximal benefits from neuromorphic computing, it is necessary to perform all autonomy functions end-to-end on a single neuromorphic chip, from low-level attitude control to high-level navigation. This research presents the first neuromorphic control system using a spiking neural network (SNN) to effectively map a drone's raw sensory input directly to motor commands. We apply this method to low-level attitude estimation and control for a quadrotor, deploying the SNN on a tiny Crazyflie. We propose a modular SNN, separately training and then merging estimation and control sub-networks. The SNN is trained with imitation learning, using a flight dataset of sensory-motor pairs. Post-training, the network is deployed on the Crazyflie, issuing control commands from sensor inputs at 500 Hz. Furthermore, for the training procedure we augmented training data by flying a controller with additional excitation and time-shifting the target data to enhance the predictive capabilities of the SNN. On the real drone, the perception-to-control SNN tracks attitude commands with an average error of 3.0 degrees, compared to 2.7 degrees for the regular flight stack. We also show the benefits of the proposed learning modifications for reducing the average tracking error and reducing oscillations. Our work shows the feasibility of performing neuromorphic end-to-end control, laying the basis for highly energy-efficient and low-latency neuromorphic autopilots. © 2016 IEEE.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-105002366935&doi=10.1109%2fLRA.2025.3553418&partnerID=40&md5=0221c479621f61be5460c34dbcd722cd,IEEE Robotics and Automation Letters,2025
An Accountable GAKA Protocol With Changeable Thresholds and Verifiable Shares in UAVs-Assisted IoVs for Emergency Rescue,"Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) equipped with high line-of-sight communications have been explored as a complement to emergency communication vehicles (ECVs), particularly when ground Internet of Vehicles (IoVs) is dysfunctional resulting from natural disasters. To protect the communication security and integrity of this air-ground integrated networks created in an untrusted and open wireless environment, authentication and key agreement (AKA) is an essential mechanism to establish a secure communication channel by negotiating a session key. Nonetheless, general AKA protocols are typically not ideal for time-sensitive and computing-intensive UAVs-assisted IoVs emergency rescue, in that they are unable to simultaneously satisfy efficiency and key security requirements including accountability, resilience, thresholds changeability, shares verifiability, group adaptability, and key update. To address this challenge, this paper proposes an accountable group authentication and key agreement (GAKA) protocol with changeable thresholds and verifiable shares supporting adaptive group memberships and updatable keys (i.e. SecER). To safeguard accurate rescue decisions for ground ECVs enabled by reliable collaboration among multiple UAVs, we propose a pseudonym mechanism that aims to provide accountability for UAVs. To achieve resilience and thresholds changeability, our SecER utilizes secret sharing coupled with random parameters to seamlessly transform our GAKA protocol into one running with a new threshold in one round (i.e. round-optimal), rather than two rounds. Finally, verifiable parameters and updatable keys are respectively applied to counter deception attacks caused by maliciously distributed shares and to support adaptive network topology (i.e. UAVs joining and leaving). Extensive simulations show that compared to the state-of-the-art approaches, our SecER is superior in balancing security and efficiency. © 2000-2011 IEEE.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-105001599228&doi=10.1109%2fTITS.2025.3531383&partnerID=40&md5=1717a00a1646147b5fd07b73d0032020,IEEE Transactions on Intelligent Transportation Systems,2025
GNSS Jammer Localization and Identification With Airborne Commercial GNSS Receivers,"Global Navigation Satellite Systems (GNSS) are fundamental in ubiquitously providing position and time to a wide gamut of systems. Jamming remains a realistic threat in many deployment settings, civilian and tactical. Specifically, in drones sustained denial raises safety critical concerns. This work presents a strategy that allows detection, localization, and classification both in the frequency and time domain of interference signals harmful to navigation. A high-performance Vertical Take Off and Landing (VTOL) drone with a single antenna and a commercial GNSS receiver is used to geolocate and characterize RF emitters at long range, to infer the navigation impairment. Raw IQ baseband snapshots from the GNSS receiver make the application of spectral correlation methods possible without extra software-defined radio payload, paving the way to spectrum identification and monitoring in airborne platforms, aiming at RF situational awareness. Live testing at Jammertest, in Norway, with portable, commercially available GNSS multi-band jammers demonstrates the ability to detect, localize, and characterize harmful interference. Our system pinpointed the position with an error of a few meters of the transmitter and the extent of the affected area at long range, without entering the denied zone. Additionally, further spectral content extraction is used to accurately identify the jammer frequency, bandwidth, and modulation scheme based on spectral correlation techniques. © 2005-2012 IEEE.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-105002263966&doi=10.1109%2fTIFS.2025.3550050&partnerID=40&md5=7720b10aefa4db14b3802b8933ffa2f3,IEEE Transactions on Information Forensics and Security,2025
Multi-Agent Generative Adversarial Interactive Self-Imitation Learning for AUV Formation Control and Obstacle Avoidance,"Multiple autonomous underwater vehicles (multi-AUVs) can cooperatively accomplish tasks that a single AUV cannot complete. Recently, multi-agent reinforcement learning has been introduced to control of multi-AUV. However, designing efficient reward functions for various tasks of multi-AUV control is difficult or even impractical. Multi-agent generative adversarial imitation learning (MAGAIL) allows multi-AUV to learn from expert demonstration instead of pre-defined reward functions, but suffers from the deficiency of requiring optimal demonstrations and not surpassing provided expert demonstrations. This letter builds upon the MAGAIL algorithm by proposing multi-agent generative adversarial interactive self-imitation learning (MAGAISIL), which can facilitate AUVs to learn policies by gradually replacing the provided sub-optimal demonstrations with self-generated good trajectories selected by a human trainer. Our experimental results in three multi-AUV formation control and obstacle avoidance tasks on the Gazebo platform with AUV simulator of our lab show that AUVs trained via MAGAISIL can surpass the provided sub-optimal expert demonstrations and reach a performance close to or even better than MAGAIL with optimal demonstrations. Further results indicate that AUVs' policies trained via MAGAISIL can adapt to complex and different tasks as well as MAGAIL learning from optimal demonstrations. © 2025 IEEE.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-105001566732&doi=10.1109%2fLRA.2025.3550743&partnerID=40&md5=214324b295e8d8a5da4e438b17e3bf97,IEEE Robotics and Automation Letters,2025
Lane Change Prediction for Autonomous Driving With Transferred Trajectory Interaction,"In mixed-autonomy traffic environments, accurately predicting the lane change behavior of human-driven vehicles is critical for ensuring the safety and reliability of autonomous vehicle decision-making. However, existing approaches face two major challenges: 1) they tend to represent the relationships between the target vehicle and surrounding vehicles using parameters like relative position and speed. This approach either requires a fixed number of surrounding vehicles or introduces significant noise by relying on virtual vehicles; and 2) they often fail to fully exploit the vast amount of available vehicle trajectory data, leaving the complexities of vehicular interactions underexplored. To address these issues, this paper presents a novel lane change prediction framework using Transformer-based transfer learning. Our design aims to leverage inter-vehicle interactions learned from trajectory data to improve lane-change prediction accuracy. Specifically, pre-trained trajectory prediction models are used to adapt dynamically to the varying number of surrounding vehicles and to capture interaction context from large sets of trajectory data. We then refine the Transformer model to integrate this context and predict the target vehicle’s lane change intentions. The Transformer encoder transforms trajectory interaction context into a lane-change-oriented context using aggregated multi-head attention. The Transformer decoder, in turn, utilizes this context alongside the target vehicle’s states through relation-aware multi-head attention to forecast lane change behavior. Extensive experiments on two real-world datasets demonstrate that our proposed framework outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in both accuracy and robustness. © 2000-2011 IEEE.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-105001711176&doi=10.1109%2fTITS.2025.3542517&partnerID=40&md5=76a61fdf86b390ac2c4a562629d974da,IEEE Transactions on Intelligent Transportation Systems,2025
A Knowledge-Driven Cooperative Coevolutionary Algorithm for Integrated Distributed Production and Transportation Scheduling Problem,"With increasing market competition, integration between production and transportation in supply chain has been valued to improve the operational performance. Meanwhile, the distributed manufacturing has emerged as a modern paradigm, fostering flexible and intelligent development. In this paper, we address an integrated distributed production and transportation scheduling problem (IDPTSP), taking into account the production plan in distributed heterogeneous hybrid flow-shops, as well as the transportation decisions made by third-party logistics provider. First, the objective calculation is presented to minimize total costs and energy consumption during production and transportation process, and problem property is analyzed to obtain an optimal pickup time strategy. Second, a knowledge-driven cooperative coevolutionary algorithm (KCCA) is proposed, incorporating multiple problem-specific heuristics and operators based on the characteristics of the subproblems in IDPTSP. Third, Q learning assisted cooperative coevolutionary search is proposed via analyzing the interconnections among different subproblems to effectively and efficiently explore their search space. Fourth, local intensification search with multiple operators fusing prior knowledge is incorporated for low-density regions in objective space to enhance exploitation ability. Extensive experiments are carried out to test performances of the KCCA and the numerical comparisons demonstrate effectiveness of the specific designs and superiority of the KCCA over state-of-the-art algorithms in solving the IDPTSP. Note to Practitioners—Drawing inspiration from a real-life case in electronics supply, the focus on distributed manufacturing and the integration of manufacturing and logistics has garnered significant attention from managers due to the enterprises’ need to reduce intermediate stocks and enhance operational performance. The primary focus of enterprises is on reducing costs during production and transportation. Additionally, energy consumption has become a crucial consideration due to rising energy costs and limited energy supplies. However, the complexity of this practical scenario has significantly increased due to the presence of multiple subproblems and objectives. Traditional scheduling methods are unable to effectively and efficiently obtain a Pareto front with convergence and diversity. Based on the characterises of the scheduling problem, we provided a knowledge-driven cooperative coevolutionary algorithm to minimize total costs and energy consumption during production and transportation process. At production stage, factory assignment and job sequence are determined in distributed heterogeneous hybrid flow-shops, while job batching and vehicle routing are determined at transportation stage. Through the analysis of problem properties, an optimal pickup time strategy is introduced and multiple rules and search operators are provided to enhance optimization efficiency. Meanwhile, the framework of cooperative coevolutionary search offers an effective approach to addressing such complex integrated scheduling problems. From experimental comparisons, the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm is verified surpassing state-of-the-art algorithms. Therefore, practitioners can benefit from non-dominated schedules characterized by reduced costs and enhanced energy efficiency. © 2024 IEEE.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-105001184375&doi=10.1109%2fTASE.2024.3422473&partnerID=40&md5=7041bc3e6d131ff7bd415ddab37d216c,IEEE Transactions on Automation Science and Engineering,2025
Secure State Estimation for Cyber-Physical Systems Against Active Eavesdropping Attacks: A Stochastic Encryption-Based Method,"This article is concerned with the problem of remote state estimation for cyber-physical systems (CPSs) in the presence of an active eavesdropper. To prevent information leakage, a novel stochastic encryption scheme is proposed to protect the data transmitted via packet loss channel. The scheme can guarantee the user’s privacy and force the estimation error of the eavesdropper to diverge by using a predefined scheduling sequence to transmit raw data or an encrypted version randomly. In this case, two types of data are considered: raw measurements and local estimates. Aiming at these two transmission scenarios, the expected estimation error recursions with respect to encryption mechanisms, channel parameters, and the system dynamics are derived in the minimum mean error estimation sense. Further, we show the conditions that require the expected estimation error covariance of the user to be bounded, while the active eavesdropper’s expected estimation error grows unbounded by mathematical induction and matrix theory methods. Finally, an application example is illustrated to verify the performance of the encryption scheme. Note to Practitioners—This paper addresses the secure state estimation for a class of CPSs in the presence of eavesdropping attacks, which plays a vital role in many critical infrastructures, such as unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) and smart grids. The system’s confidential information is transmitted over the wireless channel to a remote estimator that is likely to be overheard by a malicious eavesdropper. Most existing privacy protection methods not only constrain the capabilities of eavesdroppers, such as packet reception rate, but also have limited ability to disrupt the estimated performance of eavesdroppers. Besides, few studies have been conducted on the impact of active eavesdroppers who may have a higher packet reception rate. To overcome these difficulties, based on control-theoretic approaches, we propose two alternative encryption schemes for two different transmission scenarios. Note that our scheme can guarantee that the user’s estimation error is bounded, while the estimation error of the eavesdropper goes to unbounded. Accordingly, the privacy and estimation performance of the system can be ensured by our encryption scheme, and the encryption schemes can be conveniently applied to practical systems. © 2024 IEEE.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-105001087513&doi=10.1109%2fTASE.2024.3457903&partnerID=40&md5=c1d4eca5ed1eddf230a8cddc2e9b5010,IEEE Transactions on Automation Science and Engineering,2025
Tensor-Based Sparsity-Inducing Localization of AAV Swarms-Assisted Mobile Edge Computing Systems,"Autonomous aerial vehicle (AAV)-assisted mobile edge computing systems have high mobility and can be deployed in various rugged terrain and emergency scenarios for communication and monitoring. However, the malicious use of AAV swarms poses a potential threat to key areas. Therefore, accurate positioning of AAV swarms is crucial for the security of high-value civilian facilities and equipment. This article investigates angle estimation of coherent signals from AAV swarms in bistatic multiple-input multiple-output radar under nonuniform noise. The nonuniform noise powers are iteratively estimated based on the structural characteristics of the covariance matrix and subsequently removed from the observations. Transmission-reception diversity smoothing is then applied to the signal subspace, obtained through higher order singular value decomposition, to recover the rank deficiency. Furthermore, a block sparse reconstruction method is proposed, utilizing the reweighted smoothed \ell _{0}-norm, to obtain angle estimates. This method automatically pairs the direction-of-arrivals and direction-of-departures of AAVs.

Toward Proactive-Aware Autonomous Driving: A Reinforcement Learning Approach Utilizing Expert Priors During Unprotected Turns,"Given the complex nature of interaction under ambiguous right-of-way scenarios, the interactions between Autonomous Vehicles (AVs) and Human-driven Vehicles (HVs) present considerable challenges to the safety and efficiency of the traffic system. Existing AVs struggle to comprehend and apply common HV social norms, especially the proactive behavior exhibited by adept human drivers in ambiguous right-of-way scenarios. In this study, we propose a novel framework to leverage expert priors for proactive-aware decision-making in ambiguous right-of-way, merging Reinforcement Learning (RL) with parameterized modeling. Building upon unprotected-turning interactions from real-world driving datasets, we select typical cases under ambiguous right-of-way as human-expert priors, which are utilized to guide the learning of the RL agent. Then, a Hidden Markov Model (HMM), which is governed by interpretable parameters derived from expert priors, introduces human decision updating mechanism into AV strategy. Experimenting with typical driving tasks, our approach achieves balanced safety and efficiency in tackling ambiguities of right-of-way, with superior decision-making performance via the guidance of expert priors when compared with established baselines. Furthermore, the results indicate that the proposed method enables AVs to accelerate the convergence during the interaction by consistent probing and decision updates. © 2000-2011 IEEE.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-105001060825&doi=10.1109%2fTITS.2024.3520589&partnerID=40&md5=a245b2c929b94a73d596fca80ac0edbd,IEEE Transactions on Intelligent Transportation Systems,2025
An Intelligent Multi-Layer Control Architecture for Logistics Operations of Autonomous Vehicles in Manufacturing Systems,"In this paper, autonomous vehicles are considered for addressing logistic operations in manufacturing systems. The starting idea consists in organizing a given group of autonomous robots/vehicles in a finite set of platoons in charge to accomplish prescribed job(s) within the manufacturing system. Three aspects are then needed to be formally outlined: task scheduling, routing decisions and command inputs computations. Here, a new distributed multi-layer architecture has been conceived by using three methodologies: timed colored Petri nets, deep reinforcement learning and model predictive control. Roughly speaking, timed colored Petri nets are exploited to formally model the manufacturing system so that an optimal scheduling task complying with the required jobs and the available vehicles is derived; then, run-time routing decisions are obtained by using a distributed reinforcement learning algorithm which exploits the available information provided by the vehicle sensor module; finally, the distributed model predictive control algorithm is built by resorting to a set-theoretic approach where most of the computations are off-line performed. A flexible manufacturing system consisting of four machines and a Load/Unload station is used for simulation purposes. Specifically, five jobs are hypothesized and some scenarios with an increasing number of available vehicles are simulated. In order to evaluate the benefits of the proposed approach, a time criterion based on the completion of all the jobs is considered with the aim to put in light that increasing the number of vehicles improves the control performance until congestion phenomena become unavoidable. Note to Practitioners—This paper proposes an innovative methodology for addressing the logistic operations within flexible manufacturing systems (FMSs) by using a team of autonomous ground vehicles. Unlike existing approaches, the core of this framework consists in combining along a hierarchical structure the capabilities of timed colored Petri nets and the deep reinforcement learning techniques to determine a near-optimal scheduling and run-time routing decisions that are provided to the distributed model predictive units in charge to accomplish the prescribed task. This multi-layer architecture has two main merits: a single platoon, completely disconnected from the others, is devoted to perform its own job; computational burdens are affordable during the on-line operations because most of the computations are moved in the off-line phase. © 2004-2012 IEEE.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-105001203307&doi=10.1109%2fTASE.2024.3435342&partnerID=40&md5=1faf397ca2bf03d1a42feac98ff584cf,IEEE Transactions on Automation Science and Engineering,2025
Cooperative Warning and Risk-Averse Safety Control for Multiple UAVs,"The avoidance of dynamic obstacles is a challenging issue for uncrewed aerial vehicle (UAV) due to its limited perception range.This article presents a framework including cooperative warning and risk-averse safety control for multiple UAVs. When external obstacles are discovered, the evaluation of conditional value-at-risk for the obstacles is performed by the discoverers. Whenever the risk value violates the designed safety threshold, the warning information will be transmitted to the threatened neighbors immediately. Moreover, by incorporating the event-triggered mechanism, the risk-averse safety control scheme is constructed. Consequently, multiple UAVs are able to evade dynamic obstacles from various directions with enhanced safety and reduced conservatism. The effectiveness and superiority of the proposed scheme are substantiated by comparative simulations and real-world flight experiments. © 2005-2012 IEEE.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-105001367777&doi=10.1109%2fTII.2025.3549797&partnerID=40&md5=3362672503086ec699dcf18b63b36802,IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics,2025
GPS Attack Detection and Defense for Secure Localization of Automated Vehicles Based on Vehicle-to-Vehicle Technology,"Accurate and stable localization system plays a significant role in safe driving for connected automated vehicles (CAVs). However, the vulnerability from GPS spoofing attacks undermines the security of the localization system, posing great challenges for autonomous driving. In this article, a security-critical study for anomaly detection and defense against GPS attacks for CAVs using vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) technology is explored to improve the localization for driving safety under cyber-attack. First, a robust learning-based GPS stealthy attack model is designed to generate spoofing GPS signals, which can evade currently widely applied Kalman filter-based localization with χ2 anomaly detector and result in vehicle positioning errors, leading to more potential driving hazards than traditional models. Then a novel detection method for GPS anomaly with V2V communication based on density clustering algorithm is proposed to detect the wrong GPS data effectively. When the GPS attack is detected, the vehicle position is estimated accurately by an innovative cooperative localization (CL) approach with multi-information fusion from neighboring vehicles to defend against the GPS attack. The proposed framework is evaluated with three real-world driving data sets in closed-loop simulation. The results show that the developed attack detection method has the best performance compared to the state-of-the-art methods in terms of detection accuracy and detection timeliness. Furthermore, the CL for attack defense can provide accurate position estimation for the victim vehicle against GPS attack to realize safe autonomous driving, illustrating the effectiveness and robustness in various driving scenarios.  © 2014 IEEE.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-105001362641&doi=10.1109%2fJIOT.2024.3424518&partnerID=40&md5=75013fc10042630d29b370ad5030360e,IEEE Internet of Things Journal,2025
Physical Layer Security Enhancement in AAV-Assisted Cooperative Jamming for Cognitive Radio Networks: A MAPPO-LSTM Deep Reinforcement Learning Approach,"Cognitive Radio (CR) and Energy Harvesting (EH) techniques have offered insights to mitigate issues related to inefficient spectrum utilization and limited energy storage capacity. In Cognitive Radio Networks, security threats, particularly from eavesdroppers, may result in information leakage. This study focuses on enhancing the Physical Layer Security (PLS) of multi-users with EH by employing cooperative jamming via a Autonomous Aerial Vehicle (AAV) to maximize the secure communication rate. In the AAV-assisted EH-CR system, Secondary Users (SUs) can utilize the licensed spectrum band occupied by a Primary User (PU) if the cooperative jamming power from SUs to the PU remains below a certain threshold. SUs can harvest and use Radio Frequency (RF) energy from the Primary Transmitter (PT). The AAV jammer disrupts the eavesdropper by transmitting jamming signals, thereby minimizing stolen information to optimize long-term secure communication performance. The paper formulates the problem of maximizing the average secure communication rate while considering system constraints and jointly optimizes the AAV trajectory, transmission power, and EH coefficient. As the problem is non-convex, it is reformulated as a Markov Decision Process (MDP). The paper employs the Multi-Agent Proximal Policy Optimization (MAPPO) algorithm to address the problem, introduces counterfactual baselines to tackle the credit assignment problem in centralized learning, and integrates the Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) network to enhance the learning capability of sequential sample data, thereby improving the training efficiency and effectiveness of the algorithm. Simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness and superiority of the proposed method in maximizing the system's secure communication rate. © 2024 IEEE.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-105001071147&doi=10.1109%2fTVT.2024.3486015&partnerID=40&md5=515c8636a004375b537a7fed0d3e68e9,IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology,2025
Human-Like Interactive Lane-Change Modeling Based on Reward-Guided Diffusive Predictor and Planner,"Lane changing presents a dynamic scenario characterized by intricate interactions among vehicles. Within mixed-autonomy traffic environment, modeling a human-like lane-change trajectory enables human drivers to better understand and predict autonomous vehicles' behaviors, thereby enhancing road safety and travel efficiency. In this study, we achieve human-like interactive lane-change modeling based on a novel framework named Diff-LC. The human-like modeling of LCV behaviors relies on an advanced diffusive planner, and the implemented trajectory is selected based on the recovered LCV reward function learned through Multi-Agent Adversarial Inverse Reinforcement Learning (MA-AIRL). To account for interactions between FVs and LCVs, we further employ a diffusive predictor to forecast future behaviors of FVs conditioned on both historical and planned trajectories. Additionally, we leverage the recovered reward function of FVs to enable controllable prediction of trajectories. In the experimental part, we begin by analyzing the significance of features in the recovered reward functions and then proceed to compare the distinctions between the LCV and the FV. To validate the effectiveness of the proposed framework, we compare the diffusive predictor and planner with several state-of-the-art methods. The results demonstrate that motions planned by Diff-LC closely reach the intended positions with small displacement errors and exhibit highly similar speed and jerk distributions to those of human drivers. We also conduct a dynamic simulation to evaluate Diff-LC's performance across different traffic conditions. Finally, we explore customized generation using the Diffusion Posterior Sampling method.

Language-Driven Policy Distillation for Cooperative Driving in Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning,"The cooperative driving technology of Connected and Autonomous Vehicles (CAVs) is crucial for improving the efficiency and safety of transportation systems. Learning-based methods, such as Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL), have demonstrated strong capabilities in cooperative decision-making tasks. However, existing MARL approaches still face challenges in terms of learning efficiency and performance. In recent years, Large Language Models (LLMs) have rapidly advanced and shown remarkable abilities in various sequential decision-making tasks. To enhance the learning capabilities of cooperative agents while ensuring decision-making efficiency and cost-effectiveness, we propose LDPD, a language-driven policy distillation method for guiding MARL exploration. In this framework, a teacher agent based on LLM trains smaller student agents to achieve cooperative decision-making through its own decision-making demonstrations. The teacher agent enhances the observation information of CAVs and utilizes LLMs to perform complex cooperative decision-making reasoning, which also leverages carefully designed decision-making tools to achieve expert-level decisions, providing high-quality teaching experiences. The student agent then refines the teacher's prior knowledge into its own model through gradient policy updates. The experiments demonstrate that the students can rapidly improve their capabilities with minimal guidance from the teacher and eventually surpass the teacher's performance. Extensive experiments show that our approach demonstrates better performance and learning efficiency compared to baseline methods. © 2025 IEEE.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-105001544999&doi=10.1109%2fLRA.2025.3551098&partnerID=40&md5=a5037e768ee20bca4d481ba4623c7293,IEEE Robotics and Automation Letters,2025
Semi-Supervised Domain Adaptation With Dual-Adversarial Learning for Lane Detection,"Lane detection approaches relying on abundant annotations have achieved great progress in autonomous driving. These approaches may suffer from performance collapse when directly applied to unseen images due to domain discrepancy. Most researches utilize unsupervised domain adaptation (UDA) to mitigate domain shifts. Despite this, there is still a large performance gap between UDA and supervised methods because lack of target supervision makes improving performance of cross-domain lane detection difficult. In this paper, we introduce semi-supervised domain adaptation (SSDA) to lane detection and develop a simple yet effective dual-adversarial learning scheme to minimize domain discrepancy. Specifically, we conduct global alignment by calculating entropy information of unlabeled target and source data to align entropy distribution and enhance feature confidence of lanes. Domain consistency adversarial learning is proposed to make full use of both source and unlabeled/labeled target data. A triplet of features is used to learn lane-invariant representations by distinguishing whether the feature belongs to same domain. This is conducive to promote consistency of lanes information in cross domain. In two datasets, our method obtains a better performance of 42.5% (54.9%) and 45.8% (64.1%) based on a small amount of target supervision. Experimental results demonstrate effectiveness of our method as well as its superiority to other methods in terms of reducing performance gap with supervised methods (https://github.com/shenhuqiji/LD-SSDA). Note to Practitioners—This paper focuses on the cross domain lane detection task to narrow domain discrepancy in lane detection among different scenarios for autonomous driving. It aims to reduce extra label annotations and retraining costs. Considering unsupervised domain adaptation method is hard to further improve detection performance when a large domain shift occurs in adaptation scenarios, we construct an effective dual-adversarial learning scheme based on semi-supervised domain adaptation for lane detection. This method takes as input a triplet of source data, unlabeled and labeled target data to effectively enhance cross domain detection accuracy, which is contributed to the perception tasks in driving scenarios, such as path and motion planning, lane departure warning, lane changing decisions. Our method has a better generalization ability in face of various scenarios and can be easily integrated in software platforms, which greatly facilitates the applications on intelligent systems in autonomous vehicles. © 2024 IEEE.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-105001060402&doi=10.1109%2fTASE.2024.3451507&partnerID=40&md5=28359143d811b82118728e2a843c73d4,IEEE Transactions on Automation Science and Engineering,2025
Effective Learning Mechanism Based on Reward-Oriented Hierarchies for Sim-to-Real Adaption in Autonomous Driving Systems,"Autonomous vehicles in Intelligent Transportation Systems aim to boost the adaptability performances of complex problem-solving behaviour in the Sim-to-Real self-driving mission. However, the difficulty for Sim2Real adaption is the so-called ""catastrophic forgetting""challenge, i.e., the pre-training policy exposes the flaws of the inability to retain previously skill motion when generalizing to the mixed real-world scenario, which affects learning in an inefficient way. This paper could deal with the above challenge by taking advantage of reconfigurable Sim2Real policies from simpler, previously learned sub-tasks, which are superior to those of pre-defined artificial systems. Specifically, a novel reward-oriented hierarchical learning framework based on hierarchical cognitive mechanisms is proposed dedicated to Sim2Real autonomous driving. Such a learning mechanism breaks down the behavior-aware experience into two distinguished types concerning environmental rewards: basic task-agnostic background and dynamic object-specific foreground. It further reveals the intrinsic association between previously learned knowledge and multiple changing events, by utilizing goal-conditioned key skill motion tailored for specific sub-task rewards. Moreover, the reconfigurable Sim2Real rehearsal is developed to boost the efficiency of high-level policies' generalization ability according to the reuse of the configurable skill motion via mirrored composition. Extensive validation on both simulated and real-world Sim2Real testbench of challenging autonomous driving scenarios outperforms, demonstrating the superiority of the proposed learning mechanism in improving task efficiency and handling stochasticity throughout learning.  © 2000-2011 IEEE.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-105001061609&doi=10.1109%2fTITS.2024.3524882&partnerID=40&md5=7b54753bf5a6da02497c5d587e6d17bb,IEEE Transactions on Intelligent Transportation Systems,2025
Secure Containment Control for Multi-UAV Systems by Fixed-Time Convergent Reinforcement Learning,"This article concerns the secure containment control problem for multiple autonomous aerial vehicles. The cyber attacker can manipulate control commands, resulting in containment failure in the position loop. Within a zero-sum graphical game framework, secure containment controllers and malicious attackers are regarded as game players, and the attack-defense process is recast as a min-max optimization problem. Acquiring optimal distributed secure control policies requires solving the game-related Hamilton-Jacobi-Isaacs (HJI) equations. Based on the critic-only neural network (NN) structure, the reinforcement learning (RL) method is employed in solving coupled HJI equations. The fixed-time convergence technique is introduced to improve the convergence rate of RL, and the experience replay mechanism is utilized to relax the persistence of excitation condition. The associated NN convergence and closed-loop stability are analyzed. In the attitude loop, the optimal feedback control law is obtained by solving Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman equations using the fixed-time convergent RL method.

SOTIF-Oriented Distributed Control for Connected Autonomous Vehicles Platoons,"This article extends the problem of safety of the intended functionality (SOTIF) to the platooning of connected autonomous vehicles (CAVs). In such multivehicle systems, SOTIF objectives are particularly challenging, since new issues arise due to the presence of interactions that propagate and intensify the effects and the risk connected to faults/failures/uncertainties, triggered by any platoon member and external conditions. To tackle and solve the SOTIF-oriented platoon control problem, we propose a robust and resilient decentralized control protocol, based on distributed observer which exploits the information shared via the Vehicle-to-Everything (V2X) communication network. The approach allows maintaining acceptable SOTIF performance in adversarial conditions, mitigating the effects of the unreasonable risks originated from sensors/actuators performance limitations/faults and disturbances. The uniformly ultimate bounded (UUB) stability and the input-to-state string stability (ISSS) of the platoon dynamics are analytically proved via the Lyapunov theory. Feasible linear matrix inequalities (LMIs) are obtained as stability conditions, whose solution allows adapting the distributed control/observer gains according to leader-tracking performance and robustness margins. A detailed analysis via the vehicular co-simulation platform mixed traffic simulator (MiTraS) corroborates the theoretical derivations and shows the achievement of the SOTIF platoon goals for a set of nontrivial and uncertain driving scenarios. © 2013 IEEE.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-105001072971&doi=10.1109%2fTSMC.2025.3538043&partnerID=40&md5=f1e108328d8d59189f3845ccd1c09124,"IEEE Transactions on Systems, Man, and Cybernetics: Systems",2025
Noncooperative Formation Tracking of UAVs Against Multiple Cyber-Threats: A Twin-Network Approach,"In this article, we investigate the problem of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) formation tracking in the presence of multiple cyber-threats. In this scenario, UAVs have private, potentially conflicting objectives, and their communication networks and local feedback mechanisms are vulnerable to sabotage and eavesdropping by malicious attackers. To address this real-world challenge, we propose a control scheme based on a twin-network structure. Specifically, we construct a virtual twin layer interconnected with the physical layer to design a resilient estimator that fortifies information exchange among UAVs under threats. In addition, by coupling the states from the twin layer and time-varying signals as masks, we achieve privacy protection for critical information. Furthermore, leveraging reliable data provided by the resilient estimator, we design a cooperative controller based on gradient-optimization to update the UAVs' positions. Using Lyapunov theory, we prove that the position of all UAVs converge to a dynamic Nash equilibrium. Finally, we conduct experimental studies to validate the effectiveness of the proposed control scheme. © 2024 IEEE.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-105001081695&doi=10.1109%2fTII.2024.3495762&partnerID=40&md5=382e3c037c9cff30993c7c5653cbe70f,IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics,2025
Equipping With Cognition: Interactive Motion Planning Using Metacognitive-Attribution Inspired Reinforcement Learning for Autonomous Vehicles,"This study introduces the Metacognitive-Attribution Inspired Reinforcement Learning (MAIRL) approach, designed to address unprotected interactive left turns at intersections - one of the most challenging tasks in autonomous driving. By integrating the Metacognitive Theory and Attribution Theory from the psychology field with reinforcement learning, this study enriches the learning mechanisms of autonomous vehicles with human cognitive processes. Specifically, it applies Metacognitive Theory's three core elements - Metacognitive Knowledge, Metacognitive Monitoring, and Metacognitive Reflection - to enhance the control framework's capabilities in skill differentiation, real-time assessment, and adaptive learning for interactive motion planning. Furthermore, inspired by Attribution Theory, it decomposes the reward system in RL algorithms into three components: 1) skill improvement, 2) existing ability, and 3) environmental stochasticity. This framework emulates human learning and behavior adjustment, incorporating a deeper cognitive emulation into reinforcement algorithms to foster a unified cognitive structure and control strategy. Contrastive tests conducted in various intersection scenarios with differing traffic densities demonstrated the superior performance of the proposed controller, which outperformed baseline algorithms in success rates and had lower collision and timeout incidents.

An Explainable Q-Learning Method for Longitudinal Control of Autonomous Vehicles,"Various artificial intelligence (AI) algorithms have been developed for autonomous vehicles (AVs) to support environmental perception, decision making and automated driving in real-world scenarios. Existing AI methods, such as deep learning and deep reinforcement learning, have been criticized due to their black box nature. Explainable AI technologies are important for assisting users in understanding vehicle behaviors to ensure that users trust, accept, and rely on AI devices. In this paper, an explainable Q-learning method for AV longitudinal control is proposed. First, AI control of AVs is realized by constructing a deep Q-network (DQN) with an intelligent driver model, with the control objective maximizing vehicle speed while preventing collisions. Then, a deep explainer for humans is developed via a Shapley additive explanation (SHAP), and a novel positive SHAP method that defines new base values is proposed to explain how individual state features contribute to decisions.

Coverage Optimization for Reliable UAV-Assisted 5G/6G Communication Systems,"Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) play a pivotal role in 5G/6G wireless communication systems due to their deployment flexibility. This article explores optimal UAV positioning to maximize coverage in hybrid aerial–ground communication links. Exploiting a probabilistic line-of-sight (LOS) model, we examine coverage radius behavior in mixed urban and suburban environments to meet specific quality-of-service (QoS) targets. The analysis reveals that the coverage radius expands as the probability of LOS increases, which in turn increases with the UAV height. However, beyond a certain height, path loss becomes dominant, and further increases in altitude negatively impact the coverage radius. By studying the maximum coverage radius for minimum signal strength and spectral efficiency requirements, we numerically determine a configuration space of UAV altitudes and the corresponding maximum radius that satisfies the target QoS. The results illustrate a dual-regime behavior, where coverage increases with altitude up to a certain value, beyond which it declines, indicating the existence of an optimal altitude for reliability. In addition, the analysis of ground surface effects shows that flying over concrete surfaces significantly enhances coverage, offering a radius up to five times larger compared to rough, vegetated surfaces. © 2007-2012 IEEE.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-105001208124&doi=10.1109%2fJSYST.2025.3532232&partnerID=40&md5=98be18ca36c6fcca51914aa24f161be6,IEEE Systems Journal,2025

An Adaptive Hierarchical Framework With Contrastive Aggregation for Traffic Sign Classification,"Autonomous vehicles rely on accurate traffic sign classification, which is typically achieved through supervised learning. However, the diversity and complexity of traffic signs make it impractical to rely solely on large labeled datasets. While abundant data exists for common signs such as stop and yield signs, less common signs often lack sufficient representation in existing datasets. Few-shot learning has been proposed as an alternative solution for such cases in which there is not enough training data, but its effectiveness decreases as the number of classes increases. To address these challenges, our research introduces an innovative adaptive hierarchical framework with contrastive aggregation (HF-CA).

Hierarchical Federated Learning in Inland Waterways via Dataset Distillation and Resource Allocation,"The goal of 6G is to achieve ubiquitous connectivity in heterogeneous and large-scale networks, and Hierarchical Federated Learning (HiFL) is an effective approach to assist AI technologies at the network edge. However, the “waist-shaped client-channel-cloud” architecture of maritime communication network greatly limits the implementation of hierarchical federated edge learning. Considering the aforementioned limitations, a hierarchical federated data distillation method based on UAV-assisted MEC systems is proposed, called Data Augmentation Distilled Federated Learning (DADFL). Specifically, DADFL reduce the communication process between clients and edge servers to just one round. Each client extracts their private dataset, sends synthesized data to the server, and collectively trains a global model. Building upon this, we propose a Global Optimal Iterative Search Algorithm (GOISA) considering client heterogeneity and resource constraints. GOISA minimizes overall latency by optimizing client heterogeneity, bandwidth allocation, and UAV transmission rates. Simulation experiments demonstrate that our proposed system achieves performance comparable to or even better than traditional federated learning, while reducing communication overhead by three orders of magnitude, greatly improving communication efficiency. © 2024 IEEE.

Evaluating driver-pedestrian interaction behavior in different environments via Markov-game-based inverse reinforcement learning,"The rapid advances in the technology of Autonomous Vehicles (AVs) requires effective collision avoidance systems that should be able to identify crash-risk situations and make AVs react fast. These systems can be modeled using Reinforcement Learning, where agents are assumed as rational decision-makers that take optimal decisions to achieve a goal (e.g., avoid a crash), which can be written in terms of a reward function. However, obtaining this reward function might be challenging as it deals with human behavior, and Inverse Reinforcement Learning can be implemented to recover these functions from actual road user trajectories in near-miss interactions. This approach provides reward functions that give insights into road user behavior and optimal policies that represent the best sequence of decisions to avoid a crash. However, road user behavior varies considerably depending on the traffic environment, and policies from one location might not be entirely transferable to different locations. This study utilizes Multi-agent Adversarial Inverse Reinforcement Learning (MA-AIRL) to simulate conflict trajectories of vehicle–pedestrian interactions in four different cities (i.e., Boston, Las Vegas, Pittsburgh, and Singapore). This model accounts for the competitive behavior in conflict interactions by explicitly considering that road users have an equilibrium between their intentions. Results show that the behavior is noticeably different depending on the environment. For example, the reward functions demonstrate that road users have various preferences when interacting with each other. Moreover, the MA-AIRL was reasonably able to replicate the evasive action mechanisms of drivers and pedestrians, but the accuracy of this prediction varied among the four cities, reflecting the difference in the environment. Finally, transferring agent behavior from one location to another led to increased risk levels. Therefore, to be implemented in AV collision systems, multi-agent policies should consider local behavioral characteristics as road user behavior plays a crucial role in safety. © 2024 Elsevier Ltd",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85204649056&doi=10.1016%2fj.eswa.2024.125405&partnerID=40&md5=0658e049fb468049dfcd41aa850ad973,Expert Systems with Applications,2025
Self-Triggered MPC for Teleoperation of Networked Mobile Robotic System via High-Order Estimation,"Since the teleoperation process of networked mobile robotic systems (NMRSs) is generally affected by the coupling of the human force, complex dynamical model, external environment and nonholonomic constraints, designing an effectiveness control to guarantee the desired performance for the teleoperation task is a challenging work. Besides, due to the limitation of the communication and control technology, the controller for the teleoperation system is usually required to have low computation load and low monitoring sampling frequency. To address these challenges, a novel self-triggered model predictive control (STMPC) framework, being consisted of the local STMPC, high-order estimation and M/R fixed-time controller, is constructed. Compared to traditional MPC methods, our proposed local STMPC offers lower computational load and requires fewer monitoring resources while retaining the ability to optimize control performance and handle multiple constraints. Using the presented STMPC framework in a hierarchical manner and newly designed high-order estimation, we successfully and simultaneously solve the teleoperation task while accounting for the self-triggering mechanism, decentralized control implementation, disturbance rejection, and complex nonholonomic model. Additionally, we derive sufficient conditions for ensuring the stability of the closed-loop system. Finally, the simulation and experiment results are provided to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed STMPC framework. Note to Practitioners - Our research introduces a groundbreaking framework, self-triggered model predictive control (STMPC), specifically designed to elevate control efficiency, quality, and reliability in the context of remote operation of networked mobile robotic systems (NMRSs).

These environments are often characterized by extreme external conditions and unpredictable external influences, such as meteorite impacts, flames, obstacles, and explosions, posing significant challenges for the control and task execution of unmanned vehicle fleets. Moreover, these missions demand high precision and control responsiveness from the robotic clusters to swiftly accomplish urgent tasks. Consequently, the need arises for autonomous vehicle fleets that not only possess the capacity to adapt to various constraints and external disturbances but also execute mission tasks swiftly and precisely. STMPC, as presented in this paper, demonstrates its capability to address these issues and requirements effectively, making it a versatile and powerful tool for enhancing control and system performance in various scenarios.  © 2024 IEEE.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-105000115374&doi=10.1109%2fTASE.2024.3436922&partnerID=40&md5=2fcb3459f7f407c83d1e3782e762ce49,IEEE Transactions on Automation Science and Engineering,2025
Road adhesion coefficient Estimation: Physics-informed deep learning method with vehicle dynamics model,"Road adhesion coefficient (RAC) is not only a significant basis for trajectory planning and decision-making of autonomous vehicles but also a critical parameter to determine the control potential of autonomous vehicles under complex operating conditions. Accurate, timely, and reliable estimation of RAC facilitates many function units of autonomous vehicles and improves driving safety. To address the issues of low accuracy and transparency of RAC estimation method based on road surface image recognition, a vehicle dynamics model-informed deep learning (VDMIDL) method for RAC estimation is proposed in this work. The physics information related to vehicle dynamics is integrated into a CNN-based deep learning model via the fusion of vehicle physical features and high-dimensional road surface image features to realize accurate estimation of RAC. The results of the model training show that the proposed VDMIDL model for RAC estimation possesses higher prediction accuracy compared with the conventional deep learning (CDL) model. The vehicle test results indicate that the proposed VDMIDL model can provide more prospective and precise RAC for trajectory planning, decision-making, and control of the vehicle in response to sudden variations in road conditions. The VDMIDL model is applicable to a wide range of road conditions. RAC estimated by the VDMIDL model is accurate and stable under poor road condition in particular. The proposed fusion estimation model incorporates more physics information into deep learning model, endowing more interpretability and transparency to the black-box model. © 2024 Elsevier Ltd",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85203877583&doi=10.1016%2fj.eswa.2024.125387&partnerID=40&md5=ee6ba454c0926230120afb537a43f0ee,Expert Systems with Applications,2025
Reinforcement learning method based on sample regularization and adaptive learning rate for AGV path planning,"This paper proposes the proximal policy optimization (PPO) method based on sample regularization (SR) and adaptive learning rate (ALR) to address the issues of limited exploration ability and slow convergence speed in Autonomous Guided Vehicle (AGV) path planning using reinforcement learning algorithms in dynamic environments. Firstly, the regularization term based on empirical samples is designed to solve the bias and imbalance issues of training samples, and the sample regularization is added to the objective function to improve the policy selectivity of the PPO algorithm, thereby increasing the AGV's exploration ability during the training process in the working environment. Secondly, the Fisher information matrix of the Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence approximation and the KL divergence constraint term are exploited to design the policy update mechanism based on the dynamically adjustable adaptive learning rate throughout training. The method considers the geometric structure of the parameter space and the change of the policy gradient, aiming to optimize parameter update direction and enhance convergence speed and stability of the algorithm. Finally, the AGV path planning scheme based on reinforcement learning is established for simulation verification and comparations in two-dimensional raster map and Gazebo 3D simulation environment. Simulation results verify the feasibility and superiority of the proposed method applied to the AGV path planning problem. © 2024 Elsevier B.V.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85208683675&doi=10.1016%2fj.neucom.2024.128820&partnerID=40&md5=aa78ddd13fdde040905f5f26150b4836,Neurocomputing,2025
Demo2Test: Transfer Testing of Agent in Competitive Environment with Failure Demonstrations,"The competitive game between agents exists in many critical applications, such as military unmanned aerial vehicles. It is urgent to test these agents to reduce the significant losses caused by their failures. Existing studies mainly are to construct a testing agent that competes with the target agent to induce its failures. These approaches usually focus on a single task, requiring much more time for multi-task testing. However, if the previously tested tasks (source tasks) and the task to be tested (target task) share similar agents or task objectives, the transferable knowledge in source tasks can potentially increase the effectiveness of testing in the target task. We propose Demo2Test for conducting transfer testing of agents in the competitive environment, i.e., leveraging the demonstrations of failure scenarios from the source task to boost the testing effectiveness in the target task. It trains a testing agent with demonstrations and incorporates the action perturbation at key states to balance the number of revealed failures and their diversity. We conduct experiments in the simulated robotics competitive environments of MuJoCo. The results indicate that Demo2Test outperforms the best-performing baseline with improvements ranging from 22.38 to 87.98%, and 12.69% to 60.98%, in terms of the number and diversity of discovered failure scenarios, respectively.

A COLREGs compliance reinforcement learning approach for USV manoeuvring in track-following and collision avoidance problems,"The development of new technologies for autonomous platforms has allowed their integration into sea mine countermeasures. This has allowed to remove the personnel from the potential danger by having the mine search task performed by an unmanned surface vessel (USV). Traditional intelligent systems are built by agglomerating hand-coded behaviours that determine how a good manoeuvre looks like. This induces cognitive bias into the pre-defined behaviours that can violate safety and regulatory rules imposed by the COLREGs. To alleviate this issue, this paper proposes a COLREGs compliant reinforcement learning (RL) approach that gives a solution for the autonomous navigation of USVs. A custom simulation environment is developed. The RL agents are trained to deal with path-following problem with obstacle avoidance capabilities. A custom reward function is defined to consider the turning disks for the agent's decision process. A smoothing decision feature is used to smooth the transitions between consecutive actions. The results demonstrate good convergence and high performance under different scenarios. The collision avoidance with COLREGs compliances shows the effectiveness of the proposed approach under several scenarios with static and moving obstacles. © 2024 The Authors",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85210768125&doi=10.1016%2fj.oceaneng.2024.119907&partnerID=40&md5=258f552bd0054338cc1a981d52f9d4dd,Ocean Engineering,2025
Late acceptance hill climbing based algorithm for Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAV) path planning problem,"This research innovatively applies the Late Acceptance Hill-Climbing (LAHC) algorithm to unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) path planning in complex urban environments, marked by irregularly shaped threat areas. Moving beyond conventional models that simplify threat representations, our approach meticulously calculates collision costs, factoring in both the size and proximity of threat areas to waypoints, thereby enhancing path safety and feasibility. The standout feature of the LAHC algorithm is its memory-based strategy, which is simple yet remarkably effective, as evidenced by its superior performance over leading meta-heuristic algorithms across various urban flight scenarios. The study's findings are significant, revealing that LAHC not only excels in optimizing path costs but also outperforms in terms of the number of iterations to convergence and average execution time. Additionally, a detailed convergence and complexity analysis of LAHC is conducted, providing deeper insights into its operational efficiency. Key contributions of this study include the development of realistic benchmark flight environments, the introduction of a novel method for collision cost calculation in urban settings, and the successful demonstration of LAHC's rapid optimization capabilities and high-quality solutions. © 2024",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85213940197&doi=10.1016%2fj.asoc.2024.112651&partnerID=40&md5=85c8108882944ca4211e7cc91c7ec4de,Applied Soft Computing,2025
Automated conceptual design of mechanisms based on Thompson Sampling and Monte Carlo Tree Search,"Conceptual design of mechanisms is a crucial part of achieving product innovation as mechanisms perform the transmission and transformation of specific motions in the machine. However, existing approaches for automated synthesis of mechanisms are either inefficient or prone to a loss of optimal solutions. To fill this gap, a systematic online decision-making method using Thompson Sampling (TS) based Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) for automated conceptual design of mechanisms is proposed. The functional transformation relationships between inputs and outputs of the intended mechanism system are used to determine combinatorial patterns. Then, a functional representation model is constructed based on the combination rules of motion features and the inference relationships of function elements to represent a range of primitive mechanisms as fundamental building blocks. Finally, the optimal action selection strategy based on TS is applied into MCTS to develop Dirichlet based Monte Carlo Tree Search (D-MCTS) algorithm for searching mechanism building blocks. In addition, the conceptual design of the beat-up mechanism as well as the stitching and feeding mechanism are conducted to validate the feasibility of the proposed approach. Compared with specialized heuristics, D-MCTS achieves higher efficiency in finding the best combination of mechanism building blocks. Compared with other common algorithms, D-MCTS can always avoid the local optima trap to find the global optimal solution without any necessary hyper-parameter tuning. The proposed method exhibits a more balanced performance in exploration and exploitation, which provides better solutions for mechanism synthesis of given requirements. © 2024 Elsevier B.V.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85213080341&doi=10.1016%2fj.asoc.2024.112659&partnerID=40&md5=d1863ffd17f304a5e17997bae70e51ea,Applied Soft Computing,2025
A time series CGAN denoising model targeting vessel's radiated noise for underwater acoustic communications,"Underwater acoustic (UWA) communication is the primary mode of interaction between unmanned underwater vehicle (UUV) and acoustic arrays. For acoustic communication arrays placed on the bottom of a ship or close to a ship, the vessel's underwater radiated noise (VURN) can leak and modulate into the communication band due to incomplete filtering. To address the problem of VURN affecting UWA communication, this study presents a deep learning model based on low-frequency analysis and recording (LOFAR) spectral features. First, in the feature extraction stage, we characterize the VURN in two dimensions to construct an optimal LOFAR feature extraction structure based on a multistep decision criterion. Second, to further improve the computational efficiency, a processing method based on a frequency-domain sliding window for principal component analysis (PCA) feature dimensionality reduction is proposed. Finally, a time series conditional generative adversarial nets (CGAN) noise-reduction model based on fused inception and residual convolution is proposed to suppress the noise and improve the communication quality of the system. The simulation and experiments on a lake showed that the proposed method is more robust over a changing signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) and has a lower bit error rate (BER) than conventional methods. © 2024 Elsevier Ltd",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85213066574&doi=10.1016%2fj.oceaneng.2024.120076&partnerID=40&md5=72bcc27c690e5ff86fe23d4786b1a8c8,Ocean Engineering,2025
Docking assistance method for autonomous berthing by backward-time imitation learning and kernel density estimation based on AIS data,"Autonomous berthing is desirable to assist or replace human operators to reduce the burden on navigation officers and resolve labor shortages. Over the past few decades, while researchers have proposed various methods to realize autonomous berthing, no online trajectory-planning method exists that reflects the intuition of skilled captains and is guaranteed to be constrained to terminal states. Additionally, most previous studies assumed a single reference trajectory, which tended to lack important information on the permissible deviation from the reference trajectory. This study presents a docking assistance method that integrates backward-time imitation learning (BTIL) and kernel density estimation (KDE). BTIL enabled a computational agent to generate captain-like docking trajectories without tuning the objective functions while imposing implicit constraints on terminal states. The proposed method offered trajectory and guidance distributions by applying multidimensional KDE to the BTIL results. The trajectory distributions indicated the area through which the ship should pass for successful berthing, whereas the guidance distributions indicated the velocities the ship should maintain at arbitrary locations. The performance of the docking assistance method was verified using Automatic Identification System (AIS) data from Shinmoji Port in Fukuoka Prefecture, Japan. © 2024 The Authors",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85213037831&doi=10.1016%2fj.oceaneng.2024.120122&partnerID=40&md5=114f7a66638761c742626c9466763457,Ocean Engineering,2025
Research on improved null space based unmanned surface vehicle formation maneuver control method for merchant ship escort,"Piracy and armed robbery at sea remain critical threats to maritime security, emphasizing the need for effective escort strategies for merchant ships. While manned escort operations are costly and pose significant risks to personnel, unmanned surface vehicle (USV) formations offer a cost-effective and safer alternative. This study addresses the challenge of USV formation maneuvers in escort missions by analyzing the behavior components of formation operations and proposing enhancements for escort target stability. Building on the artificial potential field method, a novel obstacle avoidance behavior function is developed under a global fusion strategy. This approach overcomes the limitations of traditional Null Space Based (NSB) methods, including formation lag and trajectory oscillation. The system's stability is rigorously analyzed using Lyapunov theory. Furthermore, two simulation scenarios are conducted: one evaluates formation maneuvering under dynamic target navigation conditions, and the other examines obstacle avoidance capabilities. Comparative analysis with NSB methods demonstrates the proposed method's feasibility and superiority, providing valuable insights for advancing USV formation technology in maritime security applications. © 2024 Elsevier Ltd",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85214282915&doi=10.1016%2fj.oceaneng.2024.120225&partnerID=40&md5=c3a9daa1d9c9980b376954aa942cd6b7,Ocean Engineering,2025
Optimized SARLOS guidance for berthing control of autonomous surface vehicle with collision avoidance,"The collision with dock is the major threat for the autonomous berthing of surface vehicle. In this paper, the collision avoidance with dock is incorporated into berthing control of autonomous surface vehicle (ASV) elaborately to promote berthing safety. First, the control barrier function (CBF) is adopted herein to transform the collision avoidance with dock into the constraints of ship speed and yaw rate; similarly, collision avoidance with static and dynamic obstacle can also be transformed. Furthermore, the quadratic programming (QP) is established to calculate the optimized reference speed and the optimized reference yaw rate subject to above constraints for berthing control. Finally, the nonlinear berthing controller is designed to control ship speed and yaw rate to the optimized reference speed and the optimized reference yaw rate. Above all, the berthing control of ASV with collision avoidance to dock can be accomplished herein, as well as collision avoidance with static and dynamic obstacle. The closed-loop signals are proved to be stable by Lyapunov theorem. Comparisons are conducted to verify the superiority of the presented berthing controller with collision avoidance to dock. © 2024 Elsevier Ltd",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85212581621&doi=10.1016%2fj.oceaneng.2024.120115&partnerID=40&md5=218f2ef737cbbd9515b318a865f63321,Ocean Engineering,2025
Towards enhancing the reproducibility of deep learning bugs: an empirical study,"Context: Deep learning has achieved remarkable progress in various domains. However, like any software system, deep learning systems contain bugs, some of which can have severe impacts, as evidenced by crashes involving autonomous vehicles. Despite substantial advancements in deep learning techniques, little research has focused on reproducing deep learning bugs, which is an essential step for their resolution. Existing literature suggests that only 3% of deep learning bugs are reproducible, underscoring the need for further research. Objective: This paper examines the reproducibility of deep learning bugs. We identify edit actions and useful information that could improve the reproducibility of deep learning bugs. Method: First, we construct a dataset of 668 deep learning bugs from Stack Overflow and GitHub across three frameworks and 22 architectures. Second, out of the 668 bugs, we select 165 bugs using stratified sampling and attempt to determine their reproducibility. While reproducing these bugs, we identify edit actions and useful information for their reproduction. Third, we used the Apriori algorithm to identify useful information and edit actions required to reproduce specific types of bugs. Finally, we conduct a user study involving 22 developers to assess the effectiveness of our findings in real-life settings. Results: We successfully reproduced 148 out of 165 bugs attempted. We identified ten edit actions and five useful types of component information that can help us reproduce the deep learning bugs. With the help of our findings, the developers were able to reproduce 22.92% more bugs and reduce their reproduction time by 24.35%.

Small aerial object detection through GAN-integrated feature pyramid networks,"Small Aerial Object Detection (SAOD) is a pivotal research domain in computer vision, with significant applications in environmental regulation, intelligent surveillance, and autonomous vehicles. However, SAOD remains challenging due to low resolution, background noise, and variable object sizes. In this study, we propose a novel Feature Pyramid Generative Adversarial Network (FPGAN) to address these issues. FPGAN enhances feature extraction across multiple scales, improving precision, recall, and accuracy in detecting small aerial objects of diverse sizes. Furthermore, we integrate an Edge Sharpening Network (ESN) using the U-Net architecture to mitigate noise and distortions generated during adversarial learning, resulting in the FPGAN+ESN model. Extensive experiments on three SAOD datasets, namely DOTA, COWC, and OGST, demonstrate that our model outperforms state-of-the-art methods, showcasing remarkable improvements in detection accuracy. The proposed FPGAN+ESN approach enhances the resolution of small aerial objects and improves edge quality, leading to more robust and efficient SAOD. Our findings underscore the potential of the FPGAN+ESN model for tackling the complexities associated with SAOD tasks. © 2025 Elsevier B.V.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85217407577&doi=10.1016%2fj.asoc.2025.112834&partnerID=40&md5=8f69bbff3c8cf902b8936bfadcaae9f1,Applied Soft Computing,2025
"A knowledge-driven, generalizable decision-making framework for autonomous driving via cognitive representation alignment","With the boom of machine learning (ML), knowledge-driven autonomous driving (AD) holds great promise for improving its performance and reliability in future practical applications. To endow AD with better generalization ability like that of human drivers, knowledge transfer has gathered increasing attention in recent years. For knowledge transfer, determining what acts as knowledge and how knowledge can be transferred, as well as which knowledge should be transferred, plays a crucial role in its actualization and reliability. In this paper, we propose a knowledge-driven, generalizable decision-making framework for AD, called cognitive representation alignment. Specifically, the cognitively plausible predictive map serves as a basic knowledge-driven foundation (addressing ‘What’ and ‘How’), and a representation alignment scheme based on graph representation and shortest path graph kernel is developed to serve as the knowledge matching criteria to enable more reliable knowledge transfer (addressing ‘Which’). We pre-establish several kinds of typical driving scenarios (feature scenarios) and extract the knowledge from them to construct a knowledge reservoir. For validation, CommonRoad, a real-world logs-driven simulation benchmark, is used to test the effectiveness of our framework. Empirical results from 500 testing scenarios demonstrate that the proposed framework can not only enhance decision-making performance but also further improve driving safety, navigability, and generalization ability, fueling the futuristic development of a knowledge-driven AD paradigm. © 2025",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85217070108&doi=10.1016%2fj.trc.2025.105030&partnerID=40&md5=f7aa36de24bddd5d5fb5f14cc114a058,Transportation Research Part C: Emerging Technologies,2025
Robust lane change decision for autonomous vehicles in mixed traffic: A safety-aware multi-agent adversarial reinforcement learning approach,"As autonomous driving technology advances, scenarios where autonomous vehicles coexist with human-driven vehicles will become increasingly common. However, existing lane-changing decision models often overlook the vulnerability to adversarial attacks and the complexity of traffic scenarios, leading to the risk of erroneous decisions in mixed traffic flows, which could result in catastrophic consequences. To address these issues, this paper proposes a novel dual-layer lane-changing decision-making algorithm to enhance the safety and reliability of autonomous vehicles in complex environments. The upper layer of the algorithm is based on a Multi-Agent framework, where adversarial learning is used to optimize decision strategies, allowing vehicles to adapt to various interferences and obstacles. The lower layer introduces a collision avoidance mechanism based on the principles of yielding and action masking, effectively reducing the risk of collisions. Experimental results under various traffic densities and disturbance conditions demonstrate that the proposed algorithm significantly improves the robustness of system, safety, and driving efficiency in complex conditions. © 2025 Elsevier Ltd",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85216894194&doi=10.1016%2fj.trc.2025.105005&partnerID=40&md5=6afd71be47d44b929c8c578602211087,Transportation Research Part C: Emerging Technologies,2025
Beyond the sandbox: Leveraging symbolic execution for evasive malware classification,"Threat actors continuously update their code to incorporate counter-analysis techniques designed to evade detection and hinder the blocking of their malware. The first line of defence for malware authors is often to bypass static analysis, a relatively straightforward task using readily available tools such as packers and cryptors. To address this shortcoming, defenders send potential malware samples for execution in a sandbox environment. While sandboxing can provide valuable insights into the behaviour of software on an information system, advanced techniques like anti-virtualisation and hooking evasion allow malware to escape detection. The primary objective of this work is to complement sandbox execution with symbolic execution frameworks to detect new malware strains efficiently. Symbolic execution offers a distinct advantage over sandboxing by achieving greater coverage of all possible execution traces, as it can explore every potential execution path, regardless of the evasion methods employed by the malware authors. By carefully selecting the samples to be analysed, we can significantly reduce the workload while extracting essential dynamic features in a fraction of the time and with far fewer computational resources compared to sandboxing. To this end, we leverage machine learning in an automated pipeline, enabling the accurate detection of sophisticated malware using a real-world dataset. Our approach yields average F1 scores of 0.93 for the benign class and 0.99 for the malware class in a binary classification setup, surpassing the detection rates reported in the literature. Additionally, our method outperforms a commercial malware sandbox when applied to the same dataset, further highlighting the efficacy of the proposed method. © 2024 The Authors",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85208912885&doi=10.1016%2fj.cose.2024.104193&partnerID=40&md5=9dd188f8b82d5a9c71343a4f0bf51a1b,Computers and Security,2025
Multi-USV cooperative target encirclement through learning-based distributed transferable policy and experimental validation,"Coordinated strategies for unmanned surface vehicles (USVs) to encircle an escaping target is a key research focus in maritime operations. In this paper, we propose a distributed, transferable multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) algorithm to address this challenge. The algorithm achieves the target encirclement for multi-agent swarm based on limited observational information, while there are random obstacles in the scenario. A centralized training decentralized execution (CTDE) deep reinforcement learning (DRL) framework is introduced. Also, the framework facilitates transfer of policies to larger swarms. To balance individual and collective benefits, we propose a knowledge-embedded compound reward function. Nonlinear mapping terms are added to the reward function to meet the requirements of the encirclement task at different stages. Furthermore, to improve training effectiveness, we implement a parallel training method and a multi-agent policy-sharing (MAPS) mechanism for isomorphic agents. Multiple tests indicate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm. We developed a framework for deploying the learning-based policies in real-world scenarios.

Graphical security modelling for Autonomous Vehicles: A novel approach to threat analysis and defence evaluation,"Autonomous Vehicles (AVs) integrate numerous control units, network components, and protocols to operate effectively and interact with their surroundings, such as pedestrians and other vehicles. While these technologies enhance vehicle capabilities and enrich the driving experience, they also introduce new attack surfaces, making AVs vulnerable to cyber-attacks. Such cyber-attacks can lead to severe consequences, including traffic disruption and even threats to human life. Security modelling is crucial to safeguarding AVs as it enables the simulation and analysis of an AV's security before any potential attacks. However, the existing research on AV security modelling methods for analysing security risks and evaluating the effectiveness of security measures remains limited. In this work, we introduce a novel graphical security model and metrics to assess the security of AV systems. The proposed model utilizes initial network information to build attack graphs and attack trees at different layers of network depth. From this, various metrics are automatically calculated to analyse the security and safety of the AV network. The proposed model is designed to identify potential attack paths, analyse security and safety with precise metrics, and evaluate various defence strategies.

Sensor attack online classification for UAVs using machine learning,"Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) sensors play a vital role in maintaining flight safety and stability. However, the increasing frequency and complexity of sensor attacks have emerged as a critical threat to UAV systems. The current lack of robust multi-classification methods for detecting sensor attacks limits the effectiveness and completeness of existing defense strategies. This research addresses these challenges by leveraging machine learning (ML) techniques to classify various sensor attacks using heterogeneous sensor data and control parameters, thereby enhancing UAV system security. In this study, we design and implement multiple sensor attack scenarios targeting gyroscopes, accelerometers, barometers, and GPS. Comprehensive datasets are collected during UAV flight, integrating diverse sensor readings, flight states, and control parameters. By analyzing the characteristics of sensor attacks and their impact on position estimation and attitude control, we identify and extract key features. To optimize the classification model, we employ feature importance analysis, correlation analysis, and ablation experiments, significantly reducing data dimensionality and enhancing model training efficiency. The experimental results demonstrate the proposed ML-based multi-classification model's superior performance, achieving a detection rate of 89.38%, significantly outperforming traditional single-attack detection methods in terms of generalization capability. Our approach efficiently handles complex multi-sensor attack scenarios. Moreover, deploying the optimized model on UAV firmware enables real-time monitoring and classification, achieving an online detection rate of 74% with a response time of approximately 0.495 ms per detection. The model's lightweight design, requiring only 48 KB of storage, makes it ideal for resource-constrained UAV environments.

A cyber-resilient open architecture for drone control,"Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) are becoming important tools in both military and civilian sectors. However, the prevalent use of monolithic architectures in contemporary platforms limits the swift integration of new features and significantly hampers the adaptability of UAVs to an ever-changing operational environment. Furthermore, this constantly evolving landscape highlights the inherent complexity of assessing drone safety and security since this process requires managing multiple and rapidly changing variables. Therefore, it is imperative to adopt an open system approach that relies on microservices and virtualization in order to overcome the limits of traditional drone architectures. This study presents a new method that involves breaking down the UAV monolithic system into a network of separate and virtualized components, each holding a single responsibility and designed according to the Open System Architecture (OSA) principle. Moreover, this work proposes a novel cyber-resilience model to determine cyber threats and assess their impact on the system.

Automated detection of cyber attacks in healthcare systems: A novel scheme with advanced feature extraction and classification,"The growing incorporation of interconnected healthcare equipment, software, networks, and operating systems into the Internet of Medical Things (IoMT) poses a risk of security breaches. This is because the IoMT devices lack adequate safeguards against cyberattacks. To address this issue, this article presents a proposed framework for detecting anomalies and cyberattacks. The proposed integrated model employs the 1) K-nearest neighbors (KNN) algorithm for classification, while 2) utilizing long-short term memory (LSTM) for feature extraction, and 3) applying Principal component analysis (PCA) to modify and reduce the features. PCA subsequently enhances the important temporal characteristics identified by the LSTM network. The parameters of the KNN classifier were confirmed by using fivefold cross-validation after making hyperparameter adjustments. The evaluation of the proposed model involved the use of four datasets: 1) telemetry operating system network internet-of-things (TON-IoT), 2) Edith Cowan University-Internet of Health Things (ECU-IoHT) dataset, 3) intensive care unit (ICU) dataset, and 4) Washington University in St. Louis Enhanced Healthcare Surveillance System (WUSTL-EHMS) dataset.

Energy-harvest for orographic soaring in the monsoon climate,"Small fixed-wing unmanned aerial vehicles (SFUAVs) play an irreplaceable role in civilian and military fields soaring through the geographical environment. To perform tasks efficiently and completely, extending the range and endurance is critically important. Inspired by static and dynamic soaring, this study aims to investigate the feasibility of energy utilization in the hillside. In the present work, an energy-harvest framework is firstly proposed. A real terrain is imported in the OpenFOAM platform to calculate the unsteady wind field by means of large eddy simulation (LES). Meanwhile, the energy harvest mechanism is explored in simulation and the critical condition of SFUAVs to soar without power in natural terrain is approximately identified. Furthermore, the proposed energy-harvest framework has been validated in the flight experimentation. Specifically, the wind fields were estimated by using Extended Kalman Filter (EKF) which are proved to be basically consistent with the information from meteorological inversion data. Moreover, the quantified flight data highlights the significant advantages of utilizing hillside updrafts with the energy increased by 104.85%.

An Adaptable Security-by-design approach for ensuring a secure Over the Air (OTA) update in modern vehicles,"The rise in Connected and Automated Vehicles (CAVs) and Intelligent Transport Systems (ITSs) introduced by OEMs has increased the demand for modern vehicle sophistication. This sophistication involves a variety of software capabilities and functionalities embedded in over 100 ECUs in a vehicle. This has led to the need for over-the-air (OTA) updates. OTA updates can be delivered wirelessly, eliminating the need to bring vehicles to the garage for updates. This is more convenient for owners, reduces costs for OEMs, and reduces greenhouse gas emissions. There exist different OTA update considerations that are adopted by automotive OEMs, such as the Uptane framework, Open Mobile Alliance Device Management (OMA-DM) standard, and the general ISO 24089 standard, including subvariance of Uptane and OMA-DM. However, the systematic implementation of security-by-design applying ISO 21434 in OTA systems is less employed, and there remains a gap in this practice of security-by-design that the automotive industry can adapt to ensure a systematic approach to secure OTA update technology. OTA update security hinges on identifying vulnerability pathways for potential malicious attacks. Therefore, identifying and mitigating potential vulnerabilities throughout the OTA update process is critical for robust security. This paper proposes an adaptable security-by-design approach to OTA update, built and extended from our work Iyieke et al. (2023). The adaptable security-by-design approach is then applied to a developed prototype OTA update system based on the Uptane framework as implemented by Toradex. Security-by-design is a well-established concept in enterprise systems, but is still developing in the cyber–physical system of automotive cybersecurity. Our proposed approach covers the security engineering lifecycle, the logical security layered concept, and the security architecture. A threat analysis and risk assessment (TARA) is performed based on the international automotive cybersecurity standard ISO/SAE 21434. The highest threats identified from the TARA are formalized, and corresponding mitigation actions are defined according to UNECE WP29. Penetration testing is conducted to verify the approach's capability to reinforce the security of the OTA update systems against some of the identified risks and threats. Our proposed approach provides a systematic and adaptable security-by-design approach to ensure secure OTA updates in modern vehicles; OEMs and other stakeholders can use it to develop secure OTA systems regardless of the OTA update technology used. © 2024",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85212119600&doi=10.1016%2fj.cose.2024.104268&partnerID=40&md5=38086a6dc31070587cbc488d420e9a6b,Computers and Security,2025
MeNU: Memorizing normality for UAV anomaly detection with a few sensor values,"With advancements in unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) technology, UAVs have become widely used across various fields, including surveillance, agriculture, and architecture. Ensuring the safety and reliability of UAVs is crucial to prevent potential damage caused by malfunctions or cyberattacks. Consequently, the need for anomaly detection in UAVs is rising as a preemptive measure against undesirable incidents. Therefore, UAV anomaly detection faces challenges such as a lack of labeled data and high system workload. In this paper, we propose MeNU, a lightweight anomaly detection system for UAVs that utilizes various sensor data to detect abnormal events. We generated a concise feature set through preprocessing steps, including timestamp pooling, missing-value imputation, and feature selection. We then employed MemAE, a variant of the autoencoder with a memory module that stores prototypical benign patterns, which is particularly effective for anomaly detection. Experimental results on the ALFA and UA datasets demonstrated MeNU's superior performance, achieving AUC scores of 0.9856 and 0.9988, respectively, outperforming previous approaches.

Risk-aware deep reinforcement learning for mapless navigation of unmanned surface vehicles in uncertain and congested environments,"This paper addresses the navigation problem of Unmanned Surface Vehicles (USVs) in uncertain and congested environments. While previous research has extensively explored USV navigation, most approaches assume that the environmental maps and obstacle locations are pre-known to the USVs. In this paper, we focus on a sensor-level navigation approach that utilizes real-time LiDAR data integrated with deep reinforcement learning (DRL) for decision-making. To tackle sparse reward challenges, we propose a potential-based reward-shaping (PRS) module to regulate navigation behavior, and this module helps to improve the training efficiency of the twin delayed deep deterministic policy gradient (TD3) algorithm. Moreover, we introduce a risk evaluation and correction (REC) module to mitigate potential risks. This module employs a risk evaluation network to enhance the agent's risk awareness and an action-level correction mechanism to avoid unsafe behavior. The proposed approach is validated through ablation studies and comparative experiments in OpenAI Gym-based environments and simulated island regions of Zhoushan. The results indicate that the proposed approach significantly improves training efficiency while maintaining consistency and robustness in unknown and congested marine environments. © 2025 Elsevier Ltd",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85216368826&doi=10.1016%2fj.oceaneng.2025.120446&partnerID=40&md5=a036abc73d45411280be642bbfffd6ac,Ocean Engineering,2025
Spatial–temporal intention representation with multi-agent reinforcement learning for unmanned surface vehicles strategies learning in asset guarding task,"As a typical application of artificial intelligence, autonomous and intelligent Unmanned Surface Vehicles (USVs) hold significant practical value in asset guarding tasks, as they can ensure target security while significantly reducing costs. Each USV is tasked with inferring adversary intentions based on locally observable information and proactively intercepting intruding boats to maximize asset survival time. Most current methods primarily identify and represent intentions through either prior rule matching or low-dimensional behavioral features. However, rule-based methods struggle to handle dynamically changing intents, and behavioral features can easily introduce uncertainty in intention recognition. In this paper, we propose a Spatial–Temporal Intention Representation (STIR) model that effectively conveys the dynamic intentions of various boats in asset guarding tasks, enhancing the learning efficiency of USVs’ strategies. First, utilizing local observation information from USVs, we construct an intention recognition tree that correlates intentions with a priori task background knowledge, thereby reducing uncertainty in intention recognition. Second, we develop a spatial–temporal attention network to dynamically represent intentions in both spatial and temporal dimensions, improving the USVs’ understanding of local scene dynamics. Third, we combine STIR with multi-agent reinforcement learning to train the interception strategies of USVs. In the experiments, we discuss the positive impact of STIR on adversarial strategy learning in the asset guarding task. Simulation results illustrate the advantages of our approach in terms of learning speed and strategy effectiveness. © 2025 Elsevier Ltd",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85217472705&doi=10.1016%2fj.engappai.2025.110120&partnerID=40&md5=a001837e99b7000e8987acce022c06d2,Engineering Applications of Artificial Intelligence,2025
Quantum-resilient blockchain-enabled secure communication framework for connected autonomous vehicles using post-quantum cryptography,"Connected and Autonomous Vehicles (CAVs) are pivotal to the evolution of Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS), offering enhanced connectivity and automation. However, the emergence of quantum computing poses significant security challenges to existing cryptographic protocols. This study addresses these challenges by proposing a hybrid security approach that combines Kyber Post-Quantum Cryptography (PQC) with an Adaptive Grouping Score-based Practical Byzantine Fault Tolerance (AGS-PBFT) blockchain mechanism. The key contribution of this study is the integration of lattice-based Kyber PQC, which is resistant to quantum attacks, with a dynamically adaptive AGS-PBFT blockchain.

Privacy-preserving federated UAV data collection framework for autonomous path optimization in maritime operations,"Ensuring data privacy and operational security has become critical in light of escalating cyber threats and the logistical complexity of autonomous maritime operations. Autonomous maritime systems face such challenges in securely processing and managing large amounts of real-time data while maintaining resilience against cyber attacks. This paper considers these challenges by presenting a federated privacy-preserving UAV data collection framework to optimize autonomous path planning and protect sensitive maritime information. Using UAVs as edge nodes for decentralized data processing allows the framework to integrate federated learning, maintain data privacy, and improve cybersecurity. The proposed framework contains five distinct layers, where the data collection layer's role is to collect real-time data on vessel and environmental conditions. The privacy-preserving edge intelligence layer enables secure localized data processing at the edge. The threat mitigation and optimization layer performs machine learning models for route optimization and intrusion detection. The orchestration layer is implemented to coordinate UAV operations and manages aggregated model parameters for system-wide efficiency, whereas the user interaction layer provides operators with secure, real-time insights into system performance and operational metrics. Simulations and implementations demonstrate that this multilayered architecture improves route accuracy, fortifies data security, and achieves a 20% reduction in emissions, underscoring its potential to advance autonomous navigation and secure, efficient mission planning in maritime cyber–physical systems. The proposed edge-intelligent federated UAV system demonstrates superior performance compared to other approaches, achieving the highest accuracy (99.1%), F1 score (98.9%), and recall (99.3%), while utilizing a larger hybrid dataset (80,000 samples) with 30 features, optimized through principal component analysis, and addressing multiple target attributes such as CO2 emissions, energy efficiency, and route accuracy. © 2025",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85218905138&doi=10.1016%2fj.asoc.2025.112906&partnerID=40&md5=017a7274283d7e698bbb084a8a919261,Applied Soft Computing,2025
Automatic optimization for generating adversarial malware based on prioritized evolutionary computing,"Machine learning has been widely applied to malware detection tasks; but unfortunately, they exhibit significant vulnerability to adversarial attacks and can be easily circumvented using perturbation carefully crafted. Concurrently, we are witnessing a corresponding increase in the attention dedicated to adversarial attacks against malware detection models. Nevertheless, current research on adversarial examples still faces obstacles such as poor escape effectiveness and difficulty in preserving functionality. Particularly, greedily recruiting the best manipulations from a vast search space often leads to poor diversity of adversarial perturbation sequence. To rectify these shortcomings, this paper proposes an automated, continuously optimized approach for generating malware adversarial examples based on evolutionary computing. Our method filters effective action sequences from a large pool of random manipulations, assigning different priorities to different actions. The generation and optimization of adversarial examples are formalized as a sparse minimization optimization problem based on a fixed-length action vector. We introduce AOP-Mal, a novel genetic framework to automatically generate and optimize adversarial examples. The initialization and evolution of the population depend on the priority of actions, as well as the proposed novel evolutionary operator. The experimental results demonstrate that our attack strategy effectively bypasses the detection mechanisms and outperforms most state-of-the-art malware adversarial frameworks. Our hope is to help researchers understand the intentions of attackers and explore more powerful defense mechanisms. © 2025 Elsevier B.V.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85219231682&doi=10.1016%2fj.asoc.2025.112933&partnerID=40&md5=e2e7556211e1099df909301db5e83ae0,Applied Soft Computing,2025

Neural observer-based formation for multi-UAVs against deception and desired trajectory attacks,"This paper investigates secure formation control for multi-UAV systems in the presence of deception and desired trajectory attacks. It is crucial to note that previous papers studying the secure formation control problem for multi-UAV systems usually apply to cases where the multi-UAV systems are subject to sensor attacks and actuator attacks. In this paper, we propose a formation control scheme to address both desired trajectory and deception attacks, incorporating attack modeling, estimation, and compensation at its core. First, dynamic models are constructed for multi-UAV systems and cyber attacks, respectively. In particular, desired trajectory and deception attacks are mapped to control input channels during modeling. Subsequently, an adaptive neural network observer is introduced to reconstruct desired trajectory attack signals. The online updating of neural network weights avoids the need for manual parameter selection. Next, we propose an event-triggered secure formation controller with an attack compensation approach aimed at reducing transmission resources under an event-triggered mechanism. The uniform ultimate boundedness of the system is derived.

An online learning framework for UAV search mission in adversarial environments,"The rapid evolution of Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) has revolutionized target search operations in various fields, including military applications, search and rescue missions, and post-disaster management. This paper presents the application of a multi-armed bandit algorithm for UAV search mission. The UAV's mission is to locate a mobile target formation, operating under the assumption of an unknown and potentially non-stationary probability distribution, by learning the formation's strategy over time. To achieve this, we formulate an optimization problem and leverage the Exp3 algorithm (exponential-weighted exploration and exploitation) for its solution. To enhance the learning process, we integrate environment observations as context, resulting in a variant referred to as C-Exp3. However, C-Exp3 is not designed for scenarios where the target formation strategy changes over time. Therefore, AC-Exp3 is proposed as an adaptive solution, featuring a human-centric drift detection mechanism to detect the changes in the formation strategy and adjust the learning process accordingly. Furthermore, the Exp4 algorithm is proposed as a self-adjustment meta-learner to address changes in the formation's strategy. We evaluate the performance of C-Exp3, AC-Exp3, and Exp4 through a series of experiments with a focus on non-stationary environments. Our primary objective is reaching the unknown optimal-in-hindsight policy as the time t approaches the horizon T, thereby reflecting the UAV's capacity to learn formation's strategy. AC-Exp3 demonstrates enhanced adaptability compared to C-Exp3. Meanwhile, Exp4 emerges as a robust performer, swiftly adapting to new strategies. © 2024 Elsevier Ltd",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85213017083&doi=10.1016%2fj.eswa.2024.126136&partnerID=40&md5=7facd801049bc9ed4f1a1e559a106e97,Expert Systems with Applications,2025
Multi-UAV air combat cooperative game based on virtual opponent and value attention decomposition policy gradient,"In the multi-unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) air combat confrontation environment, deriving the cooperative policy of friendly aircraft is still a challenge, owing to the higher-order differential dynamics model of aircraft and the confidence assignment problem in multi-UAV air combat with conflict and cooperation. In this paper, a novel reinforcement learning method that combines virtual opponent and value attention decomposition is proposed. In particular, to reduce the difficulty in training induced by the higher order differential dynamics model, the actions of aircraft are abstracted into actions of the game layer and maneuvering actions of the bottom layer, in which the actions of the game layer are modeled as the pose of the virtual opponent. In the training process, only the policy of the game layer is trained, and the maneuvering policy of the bottom layer is the default policy or the rule-based policy. To address the confidence assignment problem encountered during multi-UAV cooperative training, the total value function of the team is decomposed into individual value functions based on the attention mechanism, and the policy of the game layer is optimized by integrating the individual value into the gradient computation as the baseline. Finally, the algorithm is verified on the dynamic high-fidelity training platform.

Multiple ships cooperative navigation and collision avoidance using multi-agent reinforcement learning with communication,"In the real world, unmanned surface vehicles (USV) often need to coordinate with each other to accomplish specific tasks. However, achieving cooperative control in multi-agent systems is challenging due to issues such as non-stationarity and partial observability. Recent advancements in Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL) provide new perspectives to address these challenges. Therefore, we propose using the multi-agent deep deterministic policy gradient (MADDPG) algorithm with communication to address multiple ships’ cooperation problems under partial observability. We developed two tasks based on OpenAI's gym environment: cooperative navigation and cooperative collision avoidance. In these tasks, ships must not only learn effective control strategies but also establish communication protocols with other agents. We analyze the impact of external noise on communication, the effect of inter-agent communication on performance, and the communication patterns learned by the agents. The results demonstrate that our proposed framework effectively addresses cooperative navigation and collision avoidance among multiple vessels, significantly outperforming traditional single-agent algorithms. Agents establish a consistent communication protocol, enabling them to compensate for missing information through shared observations and achieve better coordination. © 2025 Elsevier Ltd",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85214781640&doi=10.1016%2fj.oceaneng.2024.120244&partnerID=40&md5=041b22be6e313e109012dbeafc470b94,Ocean Engineering,2025
A fish evasion behavior-based vector field histogram method for obstacle avoidance of multi-UAVs,"Focusing on the obstacle avoidance problem of multiple unmanned aerial vehicles (multi-UAVs) in three-dimensional dynamic environment, a fish evasion behavior-based vector field histogram (FEB-VFH) method is proposed in this paper. First, an obstacle avoidance decision function inspired by fish evasion behavior is designed, which considers the size and movement of the obstacle. Second, the threat of each candidate direction is evaluated using this decision function, and a dynamic memory mechanism is introduced to reproject threat histograms from past moments to the current moment. Then the safety degrees are calculated and the optimal obstacle avoidance direction is determined while considering UAV dynamic constraints. In addition, a speed adjustment strategy based on cloud model is developed to ensure adequate reaction time when approaching obstacles. A formation control protocol based on consensus is also included to generate a desired formation after multi-UAVs avoid obstacles. Simulation results demonstrate that the FEB-VFH method can effectively avoid both static and dynamic obstacles while exhibiting a certain level of robustness against moderate disturbances. Moreover, the dynamic memory mechanism enables UAVs to escape local minima during obstacle avoidance. The proposed method also shows adaptability to different formations and complex scenarios.

The COLREGs, as the surface vehicle code of conduct, help to establish an encounter model integrating three typical encounter scenarios and determine avoidance tasks. The path-planning method acquires adaptive capabilities, and optimizes the avoidance path cost via RL, for more efficient avoidance. The effectiveness of the path-planning method is verified by simulations, which show the optimal path cost and reduced yaw distance in static collision avoidance, as well as successful avoidance completion and compliance with the COLREGs in typical encounter scenarios. © 2025 Elsevier Ltd",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85218958151&doi=10.1016%2fj.oceaneng.2025.120746&partnerID=40&md5=c5c44b70fe13688d9678d91eecd1608f,Ocean Engineering,2025
Variational model-based Deep Reinforcement Learning for Non-Homogeneous Patrolling aquatic environments with multiple unmanned surface vehicles,"This paper addresses the challenge of Non-Homogeneous Patrolling for Autonomous Surface Vehicles in non-homogeneous importance water environments with a dissimilar biological monitorization criterion. Traditional monitoring methods fail, especially in expansive areas such as Lake Ypacaraíin Paraguay. The proposed solution employs a cooperative Deep Reinforcement Learning framework, specifically a multi-agent version of the Double Deep Q-Learning algorithm based on safe-consensus decision making. This framework optimizes adaptive policies for such vehicles by simultaneously modeling the environment and patrolling high-importance zones. The incorporation of a Variational Auto-Encoder based on the U-Network architecture directly addresses the non-observability of the environment by predicting biological importance from partial observations. The methodology is validated in a realistic algae bloom contamination scenario, demonstrating superior performance and computational efficiency compared to traditional approaches like Gaussian Processes and K-Nearest-Neighbors. The Deep Reinforcement Learning framework, coupled with the Variational Auto-Encoder model, showcases flexibility and efficiency in addressing multi-agent cooperation and long-term objective optimization for water quality monitoring. The results reveal significant improvements, with the proposed model exceeding well-founded approaches with a 30% faster minimization of the patrolling score compared to these methods. © 2025 Elsevier Ltd",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85215226174&doi=10.1016%2fj.eswa.2025.126483&partnerID=40&md5=95e0a9092874d62b2e961a4ca30e6f03,Expert Systems with Applications,2025
DAD++: Improved data-free test time adversarial defense,"With the increasing deployment of deep neural networks in safety–critical applications such as self-driving cars, medical imaging, anomaly detection, etc., adversarial robustness has become a crucial concern in the reliability of these networks in real-world scenarios. A plethora of works based on adversarial training and regularization-based techniques have been proposed to make these deep networks robust against adversarial attacks. However, these methods require either retraining models or training them from scratch, making them infeasible to defend pre-trained models when access to training data is restricted. To address this problem, we propose a test time Data-free Adversarial Defense (DAD) containing detection and correction frameworks. Moreover, to further improve the efficacy of the correction framework in cases when the detector is under-confident, we propose a soft-detection scheme. We conduct a wide range of experiments and ablations on several datasets and network architectures to show the efficacy of our proposed approach. Furthermore, we demonstrate the applicability of our approach in imparting adversarial defense at test time under data-free (or data-efficient) applications/setups, such as Data-free Knowledge Distillation and Source-free Unsupervised Domain Adaptation, as well as Semi-supervised classification frameworks. We observe that in all the experiments and applications, our DAD++ gives an impressive performance against various adversarial attacks with a minimal drop in clean accuracy.

Reconstructing fully-sampled vehicle trajectories with fragmented observations from connected and automated vehicles,"With the breakthrough of connected and automated vehicles (CAVs), high-resolution trajectory data can be detected and sent to the traffic control center for traffic operation and management. However, owing to low penetration rate and limited detection range, the trajectory data collected by CAVs exhibit notable fragmentation and incompleteness, presenting valuable insights and significant challenges for obtaining trajectory of fully-sampled vehicles. To address this issue, this study proposes a trajectory reconstruction method by fully exploiting fragmented observations from CAVs. Firstly, the Adaptive Smoothing Method (ASM) is improved to estimate velocity at each spatial point. Unlike previous studies, the propagation velocity of perturbations in congested and free-flow traffic is calibrated dynamically with real-time CAV observations, rather than static experiential value. This facilitates more accurate approximations of the true traffic dynamics, providing key prior information for inferring locations. Subsequently, an optimization model is developed to determine the most-possible position of each undetected vehicle, minimizing the discrepancy between the estimated and referenced positions of the following vehicle. Meanwhile, a dynamic weight assignment approach is applied to ensure the consistency between the estimated and detected positions of the current vehicle. The proposed method was evaluated using NGSIM datasets. It demonstrates that the error of speed estimation decreased from 2.48 m/s to 1.13 m/s than standard ASM. The reconstruction results show that the proposed method outperforms the benchmark in terms of location accuracy, with the Mean Absolute Error (MAE) reduced by over 26%. © 2025",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85215402571&doi=10.1016%2fj.eswa.2025.126401&partnerID=40&md5=06c30affe26082a0aa7f6747d7ef4a9b,Expert Systems with Applications,2025
Forward Completeness in Open Sets and Applications to Control of Automated Vehicles,"Forward complete systems are guaranteed to have solutions that exist globally for all positive time. In this article, a relaxed Lyapunov-like condition for forward completeness is presented for finite-dimensional systems defined on open sets that does not require boundedness of the Lyapunov-like function along the solutions of the system but an exponential growth condition. The corresponding condition is then exploited for the design of autonomous 2-D movement, with focus on lane-free cruise controllers for automated vehicles described by the bicycle kinematic model. The derived feedback laws (cruise controllers) are decentralized and can account for collision avoidance, roads of variable width, on-ramps and off-ramps as well as different desired speed for each vehicle. © 1963-2012 IEEE.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-105001870915&doi=10.1109%2fTAC.2024.3481958&partnerID=40&md5=391cb1f6c89977a76c04d77ee41b8cf3,IEEE Transactions on Automatic Control,2025
Switching event-triggered fuzzy resilient control for networked unmanned surface vehicle under denial of service attacks,"This paper studies fuzzy output feedback switching dual-channel event-triggered resilient control design problem for unmanned surface vehicle (USV) systems under denial of service (DoS) attacks. Firstly, Takagi–Sugeno (T-S) fuzzy model is applied to model USV systems, and then based on the T-S fuzzy USV systems and by using transmitted output signals, a fuzzy state observer is designed to estimate the immeasurable velocities. Secondly, to reduce communication resources of sensor to remote control station (RCS) channel and RCS to actuator channel, a switching dual-channel event-triggered mechanism is presented. Subsequently, by utilizing the designed fuzzy state observer and switching dual-channel event-triggered mechanism, a fuzzy output feedback switching event-triggered resilient control scheme is presented and the sufficient asymptotic stability conditions of the controlled T-S fuzzy USV systems under DoS attacks are established, which are formulated by matrix inequalities.

Safety-Critical Disturbance Rejection Control of Nonlinear Systems With Unmatched Disturbances,"Safety-critical control is significant for autonomous system applications where safety is an utmost concern. Control-barrier-function (CBF)-based control has shown its promising potential and power in delivering formal safe property of dynamic nonlinear systems. The presence of disturbances, whether from matched or unmatched channels, negatively impacts CBF-based control, leading to violations of formal safety guarantees and degraded control performance. In this article, a new safety-critical disturbance rejection control approach is proposed for nonlinear systems subject to unmatched disturbances. Owing to the naturally intractable mismatching condition, the disturbances and their high order derivatives could generate considerable negative impacts on not only the high order CBF but also the control Lyapunov function. To this end, an observer-based disturbance rejection CBF is proposed, delivering a new robust adaptive mechanism to deal with the disturbances. It is shown that by fully exploiting the disturbance estimates and adequately quantifying the impacts of estimation errors, the proposed approach provides attractive properties like formal robust safety guarantee and nominal control performance recovery under unmatched disturbances. Simulation results of path following of a drone suffering wind disturbances verify the benefits of the proposed solution in collision avoidance and retaining nominal safety performance. © 1963-2012 IEEE.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-105001811552&doi=10.1109%2fTAC.2024.3496572&partnerID=40&md5=8eed20c66017d43dc87197a21c9a844d,IEEE Transactions on Automatic Control,2025
Switching dynamic event-triggered prescribed performance control of underactuated ASV under cyber and physical attacks,"A switching dynamic event-triggered prescribed performance control algorithm based on the N-type function (NDPPC) is proposed for the underactuated autonomous surface vehicle (ASV). The aim is to achieve accurate trajectory tracking for the underactuated ASV under both cyber and physical attacks. By this algorithm, the transient performance, steady-state performance, connectivity, collision avoidance, and conservation of communication resources for the ASV in cyber environments are ensured. The N-type function is designed to mitigate the impact of unknown gains acting on the actuator induced by the cyber attack. The robust neural network technique is employed to accurately approximate the unknown dynamics of the ASV and the nonlinear disturbances caused by physical attacks. To address the high-frequency updates in underactuated ASV control signals caused by their excessive amplitudes, a novel switching dynamic event-triggered mechanism (SDETM) is developed. Finally, the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm is verified through the numerical simulation. © 2025",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85218417686&doi=10.1016%2fj.oceaneng.2025.120708&partnerID=40&md5=e5bfc2699dcd612de20146936b77578f,Ocean Engineering,2025
Automated biomedical measurements analysis: Innovative models based on machine learning for predicting laboratory results in nephrology,"Current laboratory prediction systems in nephrology face challenges such as handling non-stationary datasets, limited accuracy, and insufficient personalization. To address these issues, this study introduces three machine learning-based models: the Adaptive Predictive Model for Laboratory Results with Patient-specific Adaptation (APMLR), the Adaptive Input-Output Model for eGFR Prediction based on Other Results (AIOM), and the Intelligent Assessment Model for Renal Function (IAMRF). These models leverage advanced algorithms to improve the accuracy and reliability of predictions for critical parameters such as eGFR, creatinine, and urea levels. The APMLR system achieved superior performance with Linear SVR, reaching a prediction accuracy of up to 96.97%, while Gradient Boosting emerged as the most effective method for both AIOM and IAMRF systems (approx. 95%).

Periodic event-triggered adaptive neural output feedback tracking control of unmanned surface vehicles under replay attacks,"This paper proposes a periodic event-triggered adaptive neural output feedback tracking control scheme for unmanned surface vehicles under replay attacks, where actuator saturation constraint and internal/external uncertainties are involved. To reduce attack signals entering the control system, an independent adaptive neural state observer is developed to recover the unavailable real velocities and mismatched compound uncertainties. Under the backstepping design framework, the adaptive neural-based single-parameter-learning method is involved to reconstruct the internal/external uncertainties, and an anti-replay-attacks output feedback tracking control law is devised. Furthermore, in the controller-actuator channel, a smooth saturation model is introduced and a periodic event-triggering mechanism is established to relieve the physical constraint of actuators.

A dual residual dense network for image denoising,"Digital images have applications in almost every field, such as medicine, autonomous vehicles, astronomy, etc., for various purposes. The performance of all these applications depends on the quality of the images; that is, digital images should be noise-free for better results. Due to various factors, images capture noise at the acquisition time, which needs to be removed before subsequent applications. Therefore, this paper presents a dual residual dense network for image denoising. The network is designed using three types of blocks: feature extraction blocks, combination blocks, and residual blocks. These blocks exploit residual learning, dense connectivity, and batch renormalization to remove image noise. The network is also designed to be wide rather than deep, which makes it computationally and time-efficient. The network was trained on the DIV2K dataset and tested on the Kodak24 and Berkeley Segmentation (BSDS300) datasets. The results show that the proposed network outperforms existing state-of-the-art architectures in image denoising, achieving peak signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR) scores of 35.03 for the Kodak dataset and 34.64 for the BSDS300 dataset, as well as structural similarity index measure (SSIM) scores of 0.99 for both datasets.

Autonomous unmanned surface vehicle docking using large language model guide reinforcement learning,"Autonomous docking of unmanned surface vehicles (USVs) represents the critical ”last mile” of intelligent navigation, presenting two main challenges: traditional control methods lack robustness in dynamic environments with disturbances such as wind and currents, while reinforcement learning (RL) methods suffer from low efficiency and often fail to transfer effectively from simulation to real-world applications. To tackle these issues, we propose LLM4SAC, a novel algorithm that integrates Large Language Models (LLMs) with the Soft Actor–Critic (SAC) framework to achieve USV autonomous docking tasks. LLM4SAC addresses these issues by leveraging the advanced contextual understanding and adaptive decision-making capabilities of LLMs. By providing high-level, context-specific guidance, LLMs enhance the RL agent's ability to interpret complex environmental data and adjust strategies in real time. This reduces the reliance on extensive simulated training datasets and increases the robustness and accuracy of the system under actual operating conditions. The dynamic request policy further refines the system's efficiency, querying LLMs only when necessary to minimize computational demands and interaction costs. Experiments in both simulation and real-world environments show that LLM4SAC significantly improves docking success rates, reduces computational costs, and enhances adaptability to dynamic conditions.

Machine-readable specification and intelligent cloud-based execution of logical test cases for automated driving functions,"The scenario-based verification and validation of highly automated driving functions requires extensive testing using a mix of interconnected test methods with varying degrees of virtualization, ranging from faster-than-real-time scenario exploration in software-in-the-loop simulations to in-vehicle testing. The efficiency of scenario-based test procedures is continuously improving, especially in the simulation domain with the introduction of parallel execution in the cloud, parameter variation algorithms and established standards for driving scenario specification. In contrast, current test case specifications are very tool- and project-specific and often not machine-readable, hindering the exchange, reuse and automation of scenario-based tests across all test platforms. This paper presents a novel machine-readable test specification format for scenario-based testing implemented as an XML schema. Its data structure incorporates logical or concrete scenarios within preconditions, inputs and pass criteria for automated driving functions following established test standards such as ISO/IEC/IEEE 29119. The format enables a tool-agnostic specification, reuse and exchange of scenario-based tests for simulation-based and in-vehicle testing. A cloud-simulation workflow has been developed that exploits the automation potential offered by the format. By means of testing a highway ramp-on function, a logical test case is generated and automatically imported into the simulator. For efficiently exploring the parameter space of the logical test case, a novel parameter variation method is applied. The combination of a dedicated test case format, intelligent scenario exploration methods and a state-of-the-art cloud simulation platform results in a highly efficient scenario-based test procedure. © The Author(s) 2024.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85212304333&doi=10.1007%2fs10515-024-00481-6&partnerID=40&md5=049795a1d1da25a6ceae8b7e77cd68c4,Automated Software Engineering,2025
Prescribed-time fault-tolerant tracking control for quadrotor UAV with guaranteed performance,"During the actual flight of unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV), there are widespread actuator faults, system uncertainties and external disturbances, which bring significant threats to its steady flight. This paper studies the problem of prescribed-time fault-tolerant tracking control for quadrotor UAV with guaranteed performance. By integrating error reconstruction and dynamic adjustment strategies, this paper ensures that the position and attitude tracking errors converge to the preset performance range within the prescribed time. Furthermore, this paper utilizes the disturbance observer failure compensation method to simultaneously handle the multiplicative and additive failures of the actuator simultaneously, and presents a nonlinear observer-based adaptive strategy to estimate additive faults and unknown external disturbances acting on the UAV. Simulation results show that the position and attitude tracking errors converge to the preset accuracy within the prescribed time without actuator failures. When actuator failures occur, the attitude tracking error still converges on time, and the convergence rate of position error is minimally affected. Thus, the proposed control algorithm for quadrotor UAV is validated. © 2025 Elsevier Masson SAS",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-105000736435&doi=10.1016%2fj.ast.2025.110162&partnerID=40&md5=f6fc5c0607c547de81d13c7c013c345c,Aerospace Science and Technology,2025
ADP-based secure trajectory tracking for unmanned surface vehicles with false data injections,"To suppress false data injection (FDI) attacks, a back-stepping (BS) control with the compensator of game approximate dynamic programming (GADP) (BS-GADP) is proposed to securely track trajectory for unmanned surface vehicle (USV). Firstly, a nonlinear parameter-varying (NPV) model with FDI is established for USV. Secondly, approximate dynamic programming (ADP) based virtual guidance law (VGL) is proposed with an equivalent VGL (EVGL) and a compensatory VGL (CVGL) by ADP to reduce the guidance cost. Thirdly, GADP compensator is proposed to improve the BS controller by the uniformly ultimately bounded (UUB) stability conditions, which is derived by the Lyapunov function of dynamic error for the affection of FDI. Moreover, GADP compensator is implemented by zero-sum game value iterative (ZSG-VI) algorithm. Finally, simulations and experiments show that BS-GADP system performance excels in resisting FDI for secure trajectory tracking. © 2025 Elsevier Ltd",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-105000836570&doi=10.1016%2fj.oceaneng.2025.121043&partnerID=40&md5=8759ef4720d4c822b7b09f6e6be11cf8,Ocean Engineering,2025
Intelligent decision and planning for unmanned surface vehicle: A review of machine learning techniques,"With the increasing demand for unmanned surface vehicles (USVs) in fields such as marine environmental monitoring, resource exploration, and emergency rescue, the development of intelligent decision and planning technologies has become critical. However, the complexity and dynamic nature of marine environments pose significant challenges to traditional methods in practical applications. In recent years, the rapid advancement of machine learning (ML) has offered novel solutions for the intelligent decision and planning of USVs.

Adaptive precision layering for efficient adversarial training of deep learning models in intelligent vehicles,"Adversarial training is a widely used technique to enhance the robustness of deep learning models. However, it is computationally expensive due to the need to calculate gradients for generating adversarial samples. While fast gradient sign method (FGSM)-based adversarial training is commonly employed to improve model robustness, it still incurs significant training time and computational overhead compared to standard training. Moreover, the robustness of models trained with FGSM-based adversarial training often remains unsatisfactory. Among the most efficient training techniques, mixed precision-based training reduces computational overheads by accelerating the standard training process. However, applying mixed precision to adversarial training does not reduce computational overheads and increase robustness. Thus, this article proposes a novel adaptive precision layering-based adversarial training and gradient accumulation method to reduce the computational cost. The proposed method efficiently assigns precision levels (single and half precision) to each model layer based on its sensitivity to precision loss. The less sensitive layers are assigned with half-precision, and the output layer is assigned with single precision. The perturbations are generated during the adversarial training by leveraging the fast gradient sign method with a random initialization technique. Additionally, the accumulation steps are also adaptively set based on the gradient flow and stability analysis. The adaptive precision layering accelerates the utilization of the graphics processing unit, and the efficient gradient accumulation method avoids unnecessary gradient calculation, thus reducing training time. By adaptively assigning the precision, gradient accumulation, and random initialization, we effectively solve three major problems in adversarial training: 1) significantly reduce the training time overheads, 2) solve the catastrophic overfitting, and 3) improve the robustness of the target models. Experimental evaluations on three state-of-the-art self-driving car models demonstrate an excellent improvement in adversarial robustness while significantly reducing the computational overheads. © 2025 The Author(s)",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85216930521&doi=10.1016%2fj.eswa.2025.126752&partnerID=40&md5=fd23e10edf0573bfe37c0aee7d488c16,Expert Systems with Applications,2025
Sample imbalance remote sensing small target detection based on discriminative feature learning and imbalanced feature semantic enrichment,"In remote sensing small target detection, geographic conditions and natural environments lead to a highly unbalanced distribution of certain target classes, which occupy a small proportion of the image data. This imbalance may cause the model to misclassify samples from the minority classes, thereby reducing detection performance. In this paper, we propose a detection network based on discriminative feature learning and an imbalanced feature semantic expansion module, aiming to enhance the model's ability to learn from scarce categories. First, we introduce the discriminative feature learning module, which mitigates the misclassification of scarce class samples by dynamically optimizing the aggregation of feature distributions, thus constructing a clear classification boundary. Second, we present the imbalanced feature semantic expansion module, which strengthens the representation of scarce category features by aligning the semantic relationships between text word embeddings and image feature embeddings. To validate the effectiveness of the proposed method, we conduct experiments using two publicly available unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) datasets. The proposed method achieves an mAP50 of 60.85% on the DOTA 2.0 dataset and 72.3% on the wildlife dataset. Furthermore, the detection accuracy for certain rare class samples is significantly improved, further demonstrating the effectiveness of our method in addressing the sample imbalance problem. © 2025 Elsevier Ltd",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85217953571&doi=10.1016%2fj.eswa.2025.126753&partnerID=40&md5=d87241caa5470a7e72ebe23ef24ddb6f,Expert Systems with Applications,2025
Evoattack: suppressive adversarial attacks against object detection models using evolutionary search,"State-of-the-art deep neural networks are increasingly used in image classification, recognition, and detection tasks for a range of real-world applications. Moreover, many of these applications are safety-critical, where the failure of the system may cause serious harm, injuries, or even deaths. Adversarial examples are expected inputs that are maliciously modified, but difficult to detect, such that the machine learning models fail to classify them correctly. While a number of evolutionary search-based approaches have been developed to generate adversarial examples against image classification problems, evolutionary search-based attacks against object detection algorithms remain largely unexplored. This paper describes EvoAttack that demonstrates how evolutionary search-based techniques can be used as a black-box, model- and data-agnostic approach to attack state-of-the-art object detection algorithms (e.g., RetinaNet, Faster R-CNN, and YoloV5). A proof-of-concept implementation is provided to demonstrate how evolutionary search can generate adversarial examples that existing models fail to correctly process, which can be used to assess model robustness against such attacks. In contrast to other adversarial example approaches that cause misclassification or incorrect labeling of objects, EvoAttack applies minor perturbations to generate adversarial examples that suppress the ability of object detection algorithms to detect objects. We applied EvoAttack to popular benchmark datasets for autonomous terrestrial and aerial vehicles. © The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature 2024.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85208727459&doi=10.1007%2fs10515-024-00470-9&partnerID=40&md5=db5e2a7d37109cef13b9bc03e68fd858,Automated Software Engineering,2025
Intelligent testing environment generation for autonomous vehicles with implicit distributions of traffic behaviors,"The advancement of autonomous vehicles hinges significantly on addressing safety concerns and obtaining reliable evaluation results. Testing the safety of autonomous vehicles is challenging due to the complexity of the high-dimensional traffic environment and the rarity of safety-critical events, often requiring billions of miles to achieve comprehensive validation, which is inefficient and costly. Current approaches, such as accelerated testing using importance sampling, aim to provide unbiased estimates of the performance of autonomous vehicles by generating a new distribution of background vehicles’ behaviors based on an initial nominal distribution. However, these methods require knowledge of the original distribution of traffic behaviors, which is often difficult to obtain in practice. In response to these challenges, we introduce a novel methodology termed implicit importance sampling (IIS). Unlike traditional methods, IIS is designed to generate intelligent driving environments based on implicit distributions of traffic behaviors where the true distributions are unknown or not explicitly defined. IIS method leverages accept-reject sampling to construct an unnormalized proposal distribution, which increases the likelihood of sampling adversarial cases. Through applying importance sampling technique with unnormalized proposal distribution, IIS enhances testing efficiency and obtains reliable and representative evaluation results as well. The bias caused by unnormalization is also proved to be controlled and bounded. © 2025 Elsevier Ltd",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-105000484559&doi=10.1016%2fj.trc.2025.105106&partnerID=40&md5=8f14f4ed00d79b0548f493276d4c81d5,Transportation Research Part C: Emerging Technologies,2025
Bio-inspired UAV swarm operation approach towards decentralized aerial electronic defense,"The protection of critical assets and infrastructure from aerial attacks by adversaries is critical to national defense strategy. In this regard, autonomous aerial electronic defense with UAV swarm have the potential to distribute tasks and coordinate their operations to provide electronic countermeasures as an extra layer of defense. However, the challenge of decentralized coordination design of the swarm is a key bottleneck in UAV swarm electronic defense operations. This paper puts forward a decentralized honey bees-inspired multi-agent-based coordination design approach for UAV swarm in aerial electronic defense. The approach abstracts the coordination and planning of each UAV in the swarm as groups of agents with a hybrid hierarchical organization. Next, based on the behavior and operations of honey bees, a task planning model for coordination of the swarm is presented. Simulation results based on interception success rate, proportion of UAV working times, and interception path lengths show the proposed approach is capable of abstracting the swarm coordination problem and achieving a generally optimized aerial electronic defense.

In order to enhance the capability of multi-UAVs autonomous trajectory planning and to facilitate attainment of optimal paths in mountainous environments, this paper proposes an information interaction and aging mechanism Wolfpack Algorithm (IIAM-WPA). Firstly, a mission environment model is established using digital elevation modelling technology to simulate the real mountainous environment. Secondly, a trajectory planning model is established by comprehensively considering the terrain, threats and formation security factors. Meanwhile, in order to comprehensively evaluate the planning results, a new composite objective function is proposed. The proposed IIAM-WPA method is finally employed to identify the optimal paths for multiple UAVs. The key improvements to the method are as follows: the initialization effect is enhanced by the Chebyshev chaotic mapping in initialization phase, thereby accelerating the convergence of the population. Furthermore, the aging mechanism of wolves is incorporated into the model to enhance the efficiency of wolf search. Meanwhile, communication between populations is augmented during the encirclement phase, which serves to enhance population diversity. Finally, a selective mutation mechanism is introduced to rescue the population from the local optimum trap. In order to ascertain the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm, the simulation results of UAV trajectory planning under different mission scenarios are presented and compared with various optimization techniques. The simulation results demonstrate that the maximum improvement rate of the proposed algorithm is 96.73% and 4.2% in single UAV and multi-UAV planning tasks, respectively. This further verifies the planning accuracy and efficiency of the IIAM-WPA method and effectively proves the effectiveness of the method in solving UAV trajectory planning problems. © 2025 Elsevier Ltd",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85217908314&doi=10.1016%2fj.eswa.2025.126867&partnerID=40&md5=c46424a834b1cce7cbb9067de8924afc,Expert Systems with Applications,2025
A finite-time adaptive intervention controller for underwater vehicle manipulator systems,"Underwater vehicle manipulator systems (UVMSs) control in intervention tasks is challenging because of the coupling effects between the system. To address this challenge, we propose a novel finite-time adaptive intervention controller (FTAIC) to control vehicle trajectories of a UVMS in intervention tasks without prior knowledge of the underwater manipulator. The coupling effects are modeled as a static component produced by gravity and buoyancy and a dynamic component produced by velocity and acceleration. First, the terminal sliding surface is exploited to guarantee the finite time convergence. Then, we design an adaptive law to estimate the static component and obtain more accurate dynamics of the UVMS system, and use a nonlinear disturbance observer to estimate the dynamic component and external disturbances. Subsequently, the proposed control law with the coupling effects and external disturbances compensation is given, and we prove the stability of the whole system. Extensive simulations are conducted on the Simurvplatform and demonstrate the better performance of the proposed method compared with that of conventional adaptive and robust controllers, with a fast convergence speed and smaller tracking errors. Experiments are demonstrated on the fly arm autonomous underwater manipulator system (FAAUMS), and illustrate wide promise of the FTAIC in real applications. © 2025 Elsevier Ltd",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-86000563559&doi=10.1016%2fj.oceaneng.2025.120900&partnerID=40&md5=765b7d684fbba9263e08046a70597653,Ocean Engineering,2025
Two-tier deep and machine learning approach optimized by adaptive multi-population firefly algorithm for software defects prediction,"Software plays a progressively crucial role, where automated software systems control essential operations. Since development needs also progressively expand, manual code reviews become increasingly difficult, frequently resulting in testing lasting longer than development itself. An encouraging option for enhancing defect identification within the source code involves combining artificial intelligence and natural language processing (NLP). Analyzing source code offers an efficient approach to enhance defect detection and prevent errors in the code. This study investigates source code analysis using NLP and machine learning, where traditional and contemporary techniques of error detection are evaluated. Metaheuristics algorithms are utilized to tune machine learning classifiers, and an altered variant of the well-known firefly algorithm is proposed as part of this research. A two-tier framework is suggested, consisting of a convolutional neural network (CNN), which handles complex feature spaces, while eXtreme gradient boosting (XGBoost), adaptive boosting (AdaBoost), and categorical boosting (CatBoost) classifiers are employed within the second-tier for improving defect detection. Supplementary simulations employing custom term frequency inverse document frequency encoding are also executed to showcase the capabilities of the suggested framework. In total, seven experiments are carried out with publicly accessible datasets. The accuracy of CNN is 80.6% for the defect prediction task, which is enhanced with the second layer using XGBoost, AdaBoost, and CatBoost to nearly 81.5%. The experiments with the NLP approach exhibit superior outcomes, where XGBoost, AdaBoost, and CatBoost achieve accuracies of 99.6%, 99.7%, and 99.8%, indicating the large potential of the suggested approach in the software testing domain. © 2025 Elsevier B.V.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85217956359&doi=10.1016%2fj.neucom.2025.129695&partnerID=40&md5=1c2072363603da382403d47b91422c43,Neurocomputing,2025
Dynamic modeling of a novel catamaran robotic system actuated by bio-inspired propulsion devices using physics-informed neural networks,"Industrial inspections or environmental awareness impose a demand for versatile and energy-efficient aquatic robots. This work proposes a novel boat robotic system composed of a catamaran actuated by bio-inspired tail-actuated propulsion devices. A catamaran is a type of boat featuring two parallel hulls of equal size. The combined hulls of a catamaran typically yield lower hydrodynamic resistance than comparable monohulls, requiring less power from the propulsion system. The propulsion system comprises two devices capable of mimicking body/caudal fin (BCF) based locomotion patterns. Macro-Fiber Composite (MPC) pairs actuate these devices via sinusoidal inputs. Servomotors can modify the orientation of the thrust forces generated by these devices, guaranteeing maneuverability to the robotic system. The catamaran robotic system can be modeled using Kirchhoff equations, but identifying some model parameters is challenging due to the scarcity of experimental data. A physics-informed neural network (PINN) is trained to tackle this challenge using the Kirchhoff equations and experimental data in the loss functions. A 3-fold cross-validation procedure is exploited, and six model parameters are identified. A good agreement between experimental data and the PINN's output of the PINN has been achieved. This device and its model can be further explored in autonomous tasks. © 2025 Elsevier Ltd",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-86000365433&doi=10.1016%2fj.oceaneng.2025.120806&partnerID=40&md5=f6157998a671f95478a9cbe28c48f62d,Ocean Engineering,2025
A robust DRL-based decision-making framework for CAV in highway mixed traffic,"The application of Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) to the decision-making process of Connected Autonomous Vehicles (CAVs) in mixed traffic flows has become a hot topic among researchers. However, real-world driving environments are unpredictable, and errors in perception systems are inevitable. Observation perturbations due to these uncertainties may cause the DRL-based CAV decision system to make inappropriate decisions or even cause safety incidents. To ensure driving efficiency and safety, it is crucial to improve the robustness of CAV decision models. Therefore, this study aims to offer a comprehensive solution for achieving robust decision-making in highway mixed traffic for CAVs, with a focus on enhancing both policy and observation robustness. First, a robust policy learning approach is introduced in the training phase. This approach enhances policy robustness by integrating an adaptive attack into policy learning, thereby simulating adversarial observation perturbations and enabling the model to effectively address tasks amidst such perturbations. Subsequently, a risk processing approach is proposed in the inference phase. This approach conducts risk detection of observation states based on adversarial sensitivity inconsistency and guides the decision model back to a safe state by reconstructing a ground-truth observation state in the case of risk, thereby strengthening observation robustness. Finally, the integration of robust policy learning and risk processing results in a decision-making framework that enhances both policy and observation robustness. The experimental results show that using the proposed decision-making framework, CAVs can make robust decisions in scenarios with observation perturbations. © 2025",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85216890550&doi=10.1016%2fj.eswa.2025.126679&partnerID=40&md5=cb76ea57c0f500dc3f009d67588e6993,Expert Systems with Applications,2025
Dual-attention proximal policy optimization for efficient autonomous navigation in narrow channels using deep reinforcement learning,"Improving collision avoidance efficiency for unmanned ships in narrow channels is crucial for ensuring navigational safety and reducing energy consumption. In recent years, significant advancements have been made in applying deep reinforcement learning (DRL) techniques to autonomous navigation and collision avoidance for unmanned vessels. However, existing algorithms have not fully accounted for the dynamic weighting of global and local map information during the learning process, leading to suboptimal decision-making efficiency and limited generalization capabilities in complex environments. To address this issue, a Dual-Attention Proximal Policy Optimization (DAPPO) algorithm is proposed in this study, which hierarchically processes observational information on a per-channel basis. By dynamically adjusting the weighting of global and local information, the algorithm accurately extracts features directly relevant to decision-making, enabling the reinforcement learning model to focus more effectively on critical information and enhancing the agent's perception of its surroundings. The experimental results show that the proposed DAPPO algorithm achieves over a 41.67% improvement in convergence speed, more than a 25% increase in policy accuracy, and a reduction of reward fluctuations by over 62.38% compared to the conventional PPO algorithm, significantly enhancing learning efficiency, stability, and decision accuracy. © 2025 Elsevier Ltd",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-86000663656&doi=10.1016%2fj.oceaneng.2025.120707&partnerID=40&md5=a09afac46e0b1f94cba6f53b11ed77de,Ocean Engineering,2025
Intrusion detection system for autonomous vehicles using sensor spatio-temporal information,"Connected Autonomous Vehicles (CAVs) have great potential to improve driving safety and comfort, but they still face cybersecurity risks. Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS) have now become the primary means of addressing this problem. There are two weaknesses in existing studies that consider sensor correlation. First, few studies focus on the degree of correlation between sensors. Second, existing studies usually focus only on anomaly detection and ignore the precise location of attack targets. In this paper, we propose a two-stage intrusion detection system based on in-vehicle sensors spatio-temporal information. The first stage is set as a behavior predictor, which uses historical data to predict current data. Where the spatial Multi-head Graph Attention (MGAT) layer considers the degree of correlation among sensors through the attention weights in the graph structure, and the temporal Multi-head Graph Attention layer models the dependence of data at different time points of a single sensor. In the second phase, the attack detector first detects anomalies based on the deviation between predicted and observed values, after which a threshold deviation ratio is introduced to locate the attacked sensor. Experimental results in real vehicle data sets show that the proposed system can efficiently detect multiple types of attacks with an average F1 score of 98.28%, which is at least 1.45% higher than the existing methods. In various single-sensor attack scenarios, the accuracy of identifying attack targets exceeds 97.00%. © 2025 Elsevier Ltd",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-105003915987&doi=10.1016%2fj.cose.2025.104502&partnerID=40&md5=8367bc44b584ea4638f8d0a41df3fc21,Computers and Security,2025
Grey wolf optimization enhanced collaborative path planning for UUV swarms,"Path planning is critical for enabling efficient and collaborative operations in unmanned underwater vehicle (UUV) swarms, particularly in complex and dynamic underwater environments. This study proposes a novel three-dimensional (3D) collaborative path planning framework for UUV swarms, grounded in an advanced grey wolf optimization (GWO) algorithm. The framework integrates a comprehensive 3D model that incorporates kinematic constraints, threat avoidance, swarm collaboration, and path smoothness, tailored specifically for the complex dynamics of UUV swarms. By combining the global search mechanism of Cuckoo Search (CS) and the local refinement mechanism of a multi-population (MP) strategy, the proposed method achieves a robust balance between exploration and exploitation. Additionally, a nonlinear search strategy dynamically adjusts the convergence factor, further enhancing performance in complex 3D environments. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed algorithm significantly improves convergence speed, solution quality, task completion time, and travel distance, highlighting its efficiency and practical applicability in UUV swarm applications. © 2025",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-105001811529&doi=10.1016%2fj.oceaneng.2025.121082&partnerID=40&md5=36dec4e336f3bba6f4f0bbf9c04572ea,Ocean Engineering,2025
Securing IoT devices in edge computing through reinforcement learning,"The exponentially increasing demand for IoT devices with the expectation of maximum fulfillment of the user needs to bring the integration of the Edger server on the premise of the IoT devices. The small size but the need for complex computation and high-end software requires the amount of additional hardware setup that can never be possible with the absence of an Edge server. Since the Edger server continuously gathers the data from the IoT device for further computation and permanent storage in either local storage or a cloud server, it attracts intruders to try to steal sensitive data of the IoT devices from the Edge server. With the presence of many artificial intelligence tools, an intruder can make serious attacks on the Edger server by breaking its security boundaries. Any individual autonomous entity like a robot, satellite, or self-driving vehicle has a set of interconnected IoT devices (sensors) to form a network, which needs to be so flexible that any new IoT device can easily be integrated into this network without any major difficulties. None of the organizations has ever adopted non-scalable IoT networks. To counter such security challenges, we propose a scalable, robust, and reliable Novel Reinforcement Learning approach having a proper task scheduling mechanism that is powered by using the epsilon-greedy search Q-learning method. The novelty of our proposed method is its high performance which allows the agent to take actions at the time only when it finds a noticeable drop in the network performance in terms of packet delivery ratio, average throughput, and end-to-end delay hyperparameters. Experiments carried out by us along with simulation and real datasets, prove that our proposed security method provides outstanding results as compared to other security approaches discussed in this paper and can counter malicious attacks efficiently. Once our security model gets trained with a threshold amount of times, then after this threshold time, we observe that no benign data packets are lost even with the presence of any external threats and always provide stable communication to the end users. The proposed novel reinforcement learning method is more consistent, resilient, scalable, and accurate than other similar machine learning-based security methods and always has a false positive rate of <2 %. © 2025 Elsevier Ltd",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-105002580677&doi=10.1016%2fj.cose.2025.104474&partnerID=40&md5=a84069b8a1f3624e919681f21e5e7476,Computers and Security,2025
Hybrid safe reinforcement learning: Tackling distribution shift and outliers with the Student-t's process,"Safe reinforcement learning (SRL) aims to optimize control policies that maximize long-term reward, while adhering to safety constraints. SRL has many real-world applications such as, autonomous vehicles, industrial robotics, and healthcare. Recent advances in offline reinforcement learning (RL) — where agents learn policies from static datasets without interacting with the environment — have made it a promising approach to derive safe control policies. However, offline RL faces significant challenges, such as covariate shift and outliers in the data, which can lead to suboptimal policies. Similarly, online SRL, which derives safe policies through real-time environment interaction, struggles with outliers and often relies on unrealistic regularity assumptions, limiting its practicality. This paper addresses these challenges by proposing a hybrid-offline–online approach. First, prior knowledge from offline learning guides online exploration. Then, during online learning, we replace the popular Gaussian Process (GP) with the Student-t's Process (TP) to enhance robustness to covariate shift and outliers. © 2025 The Authors",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-86000551025&doi=10.1016%2fj.neucom.2025.129912&partnerID=40&md5=116002aae35269136ca55548086964a9,Neurocomputing,2025
Fault-tolerant formation control of multi-USVs based on event-triggered strategy under DoS attacks,"In this paper, the fault-tolerant formation control issue is investigated for unmanned surface vehicles (USVs) with denial-of-service (DoS) attacks and actuator failures. With the rapid development of communication technology in the marine field, DoS attacks against network topology are increasingly common in USVs. Therefore, it is essential to solve the influence of DoS attacks on the systems to improve the stability of formation operation. By fully considering the impact of wind and ocean currents in the marine environment, the dynamic event-triggered strategy (ETS) is adopted to alleviate the frequency of communication among USVs. The distributed fault-tolerant control protocol is developed to acquire the desired formation control gains in the presence of actuator failures. Finally, the effectiveness of the obtained results is validated through simulation. © 2025",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-105002560251&doi=10.1016%2fj.oceaneng.2025.121161&partnerID=40&md5=b3a4e88c2b60b3451300e22626d6b961,Ocean Engineering,2025
Automatic risk level evaluation system for potential environmental hazards along high-speed railroad using UAV aerial photograph,"Potential environmental hazards (PEHs) along the high-speed railroad such as plastic tarps, rubbish, temporary dwellings that are like untimely bombs severely threaten the safe operations of high-speed railroad, which need to be frequently inspected. Unfortunately, current convolution neural network (CNN)-based methods struggle to detect and assess the PEH with varying scales under the limited semantic information. This study presents a novel PEHs automatic evaluation system based on UAV aerial photograph. First, an innovative instance segmentation architecture named YOLARC++ (You Only Look At Railroad Coefficients ++) is developed to detect PEHs in UAV imagery. This architecture incorporates a novel large selective kernel (LSK) block, which can adaptively adjust the receptive fields to excavate critical discriminative features and alleviate the impact of large variations in target scale. Second, YOLARC++ introduces a new GD (gather-and-distribution) neck network that comprises a shallow-to-deep feature fusion structure and the ProtoNet integrating multi-layer feature map to strengthen the multi-scale representation capability and address the limited semanteme issue. Conveniently, an image-to-real-world mapping model, which utilizes key UAV parameters (e.g., flight altitude, lens focal length, and diagonal field of view) and lens imaging principle, is also integrated in the system for dual-factor estimation of risk distance and area. Finally, comprehensive experiments conducted on the complex UAV high-speed railroad dataset demonstrate that the proposed system achieves a high detection rate yet maintains efficiency and convenience in complex railroad environments. © 2025",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-105000307915&doi=10.1016%2fj.eswa.2025.127257&partnerID=40&md5=b0d31b5e9c6d9f45e3e22cdda0c9e426,Expert Systems with Applications,2025
ResNet-Swin Transformer based intrusion detection system for in-vehicle network,"In response to the diverse and complex of attack types in in-vehicle network (IVN), an intrusion detection system based on ResNet-Swin Transformer for IVN is proposed to detect attacks on the CAN bus. ResNet model employs residual connections to extract deep features while retaining shallow information. Meanwhile, Swin Transformer model is capable of capturing both global context and local details in images.

Pursuit-evasion game of under-actuated ASVs based on deep reinforcement learning and model predictive path integral control,"This paper investigates a pursuit-evasion game scenario involving multiple under-actuated autonomous surface vehicles (ASVs) pursuing a single ASV in a closed and bounded environment in the presence of moving and stationary obstacles. The pursuer and evader ASVs suffer from entirely unknown models. An entirely data-driven learning and control scheme is designed to achieve pursuit-evasion game behavior by leveraging deep reinforcement learning (DRL) and model predictive path integral (MPPI) control. Specifically, a gated recurrent unit (GRU) neural network is first trained to learn the state transition function for each ASV by taking advantage of the logged input and output data. Then, by considering inter-vehicle collision avoidance as well as collision avoidance with moving and stationary obstacles, the MPPI control laws are designed to achieve the hunting of the pursuers against the evader based on the learned state transition functions. It is noted that after learning by exploiting random and new data, pursuit-evasion game is capable of being achieved in the absence of model information.

An adaptive waypoint encoding strategy is also introduced to improve path smoothness in cluttered environments. Experimental results show that the HEA-PPO algorithm outperforms existing algorithms regarding path quality, convergence speed, and robustness. The proposed method optimizes safety, energy consumption, and collaboration time across multiple scenarios.

Transforming a 3-D LiDAR Point Cloud into a 2-D Dense Depth Map Through a Parameter Self-Adaptive Framework,"The 3-D LiDAR scanner and the 2-D charge-coupled device (CCD) camera are two typical types of sensors for surrounding-environment perceiving in robotics or autonomous driving. Commonly, they are jointly used to improve perception accuracy by simultaneously recording the distances of surrounding objects, as well as the color and shape information. In this paper, we use the correspondence between a 3-D LiDAR scanner and a CCD camera to rearrange the captured LiDAR point cloud into a dense depth map, in which each 3-D point corresponds to a pixel at the same location in the RGB image. In this paper, we assume that the LiDAR scanner and the CCD camera are accurately calibrated and synchronized beforehand so that each 3-D LiDAR point cloud is aligned with its corresponding RGB image. Each frame of the LiDAR point cloud is then projected onto the RGB image plane to form a sparse depth map. Then, a self-Adaptive method is proposed to upsample the sparse depth map into a dense depth map, in which the RGB image and the anisotropic diffusion tensor are exploited to guide upsampling by reinforcing the RGB-depth compactness. Finally, convex optimization is applied on the dense depth map for global enhancement. Experiments on the KITTI and Middlebury data sets demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms several other relevant state-of-The-Art methods in terms of visual comparison and root-mean-square error measurement. © 2000-2011 IEEE.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84971578946&doi=10.1109%2fTITS.2016.2564640&partnerID=40&md5=99428f9f6103735d5ca7782a7d7367ab,IEEE Transactions on Intelligent Transportation Systems,2017
BCF swimming locomotion for autonomous underwater robots: a review and a novel solution to improve control and efficiency,"The development of autonomous, energy efficient, underwater robots for large areas exploration has been attracting many researchers, since their use can be effective in several applications. In order to improve the propulsion efficiency, movement capability and situation awareness, last studies have been directed on biomimetic robots. Over millions of years in a vast and often hostile realm, fish have evolved swimming capabilities far superior in many ways to what has been achieved by nautical technology. Instinctively, they use their superbly streamlined bodies to exploit fluid-mechanical principles, achieving extraordinary propulsion efficiencies, acceleration and manoeuvrability. Their solutions achieved the best performances based on aspects like preys hunting and living conditions. Looking at nature for inspiration as to how design an Autonomous Underwater Vehicle can significantly improve its flexibility and efficiency. This paper presents an examination of the state of the art on biomimetic robotic fishes, underlining the reasons why bio-inspiration can be a winning move and discussing how fish swimming can be the line of sight of the future locomotion technology. The paper concludes with a novel mechanism proposal, designed to produce optimal oscillatory motion between the flexible parts constituting the hull of the robotic fish. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85006754118&doi=10.1016%2fj.oceaneng.2016.11.055&partnerID=40&md5=8ffd23acacf89f968695effe6c0d63f1,Ocean Engineering,2017
A Multi-Agent System for Acquired Brain Injury rehabilitation in Ambient Intelligence environments,"Acquired Brain Injury (ABI) is becoming an epidemic problem in our society, especially among older adults, being known as “the Silent Epidemic”. People with ABI demand solutions in research that offer them with a relearning process such that they can recover not only their physical skills but also their cognitive abilities. In this context, the inherent characteristics of Ambient Intelligence (AmI), transparency and intelligence, have turned it into one of the best approaches to square up to the impairment that ABI can cause. As AmI proposes the development of context-aware systems that integrate different devices to recognize the context and act accordingly, these systems can react promptly to the needs of people with ABI while they carry out their rehabilitation process. Moreover, the exploitation of a Multi-Agent architecture emerges as a natural solution to develop AmI systems, since agents are reactive, proactive and exhibit an intelligent and autonomous behavior. Therefore, in this paper, a Multi-Agent architecture (MAS) for healthcare AmI systems is presented. It contributes to treat people with ABI by using specific devices to control the patient's movements and some physiological responses, such as the variation of the heart rate, during her rehabilitation process. In this way, the natural relationship between AmI and MAS is exploited. Finally, how this system is used to both design and execute therapies for people with ABI is presented. © 2016 Elsevier B.V.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85008950608&doi=10.1016%2fj.neucom.2016.04.066&partnerID=40&md5=0e99cbacae40c08b9e5ab97976a33da2,Neurocomputing,2017
A Consensus-Based Approach for Platooning with Intervehicular Communications and Its Validation in Realistic Scenarios,"Automated and coordinated vehicles' driving (platooning) is very challenging due to the multibody control complexity and the presence of unreliable time-varying wireless intervehicular communication (IVC). We propose a novel controller for vehicle platooning based on consensus and analytically demonstrate its stability and dynamic properties. Traditional approaches assume the logical control topology as a constraint fixed a priori, and the control law is designed consequently; our approach makes the control topology a design parameter that can be exploited to reconfigure the controller, depending on the needs and characteristics of the scenario. Furthermore, the controller automatically compensates outdated information caused by network losses and delays. The controller is implemented in Plexe, which is a state-of-the-art IVC and mobility simulator that includes basic building blocks for platooning. Analysis and simulations show the controller robustness and performance in several scenarios, including realistic propagation conditions with interference caused by other vehicles. We compare our approach against a controller taken from the literature, which is generally considered among the most performing ones. Finally, we test the proposed controller by implementing the real dynamics (engine, transmission, braking systems, etc.) of heterogeneous vehicles in Plexe and verifying that platoons remain stable and safe, regardless of real-life impairments that cannot be modeled in the analytic solution. The results show the ability of the proposed approach to maintain a stable string of realistic vehicles with different control-communication topologies, even in the presence of strong interference, delays, and fading conditions, providing higher comfort and safety for platoon drivers. © 2016 IEEE.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85015801126&doi=10.1109%2fTVT.2016.2585018&partnerID=40&md5=33bd36303a2f2ba9204341fd5a7a1226,IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology,2017
Sensitivity Analysis for Building Energy Simulation Model Calibration via Algorithmic Differentiation,"High-fidelity building energy simulation models are software tools that are built on the well-established physical laws of thermal/hygric processes to model heating, cooling, lighting, ventilation, and energy use of buildings. They are highly nonlinear systems that involve a large number of subroutine calls and submodel switches during execution. To calibrate a building energy simulation model with good quality, parameter sensitivity analysis is well advocated, since it aims to identify those parameters in a specific building that hold more influence on the building thermal performance than others to facilitate shortening the lengthy cycle of model calibration procedures. Since simulation models are given in a large piece of source codes and encapsulate a series of submodels, the prevailing sensitivity analysis is mostly built within the framework of Monte Carlo simulation and statistics-based random sampling methods. It is computationally intensive. We propose to perform such analysis via a differential sensitivity analysis method that relies on the estimation of derivatives. A key technical challenge is that the high nonlinearity of the model prohibits any analytical differentiation, while numerical differentiation is too sensitive to step size and suffers from a truncation error. We, hence, propose to adopt an algorithmic differentiation method, which exploits the operator overload feature of object-oriented programs, to obtain accurate and robust numerical estimations of derivatives in an automated and computationally efficient way. © 2016 IEEE.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84978288354&doi=10.1109%2fTASE.2016.2573821&partnerID=40&md5=9a3916d4671bffa48d796763bee42761,IEEE Transactions on Automation Science and Engineering,2017
Intrusion Detection and Ejection Framework Against Lethal Attacks in UAV-Aided Networks: A Bayesian Game-Theoretic Methodology,"Advances in wireless communications and microelectronics have spearheaded the development of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), which can be used to augment a ground network composed of sensors and/or vehicles in order to increase coverage, enhance the end-to-end delay, and improve data processing. While UAV-aided networks can potentially find applications in many areas, a number of issues, particularly security, have not been readily addressed. The intrusion detection system is the most commonly used technique to detect attackers. In this paper, we focus on addressing two main issues within the context of intrusion detection and attacker ejection in UAV-aided networks, namely, activation of the intrusion monitoring process and attacker ejection. In fact, when a large number of nodes activate their monitoring processes, the incurred overhead can be substantial and, as a consequence, degrades the network performance. Therefore, a tradeoff between the intrusion detection rate and overhead is considered in this work. It is not always the best strategy to eject a node immediately when it exhibits a bad sign of malicious activities since this sign could be provisional (the node may switch to a normal behavior in the future) or be simply due to noise or unreliable communications. Thus, a dilemma between detection and false positive rates is taken into account in this paper. We propose to address these two security issues by a Bayesian game model in order to accurately detect attacks (i.e., high detection and low false positive rates) with a low overhead. Simulation results have demonstrated that our proposed security game framework does achieve reliable detection. © 2017 IEEE.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85018921813&doi=10.1109%2fTITS.2016.2600370&partnerID=40&md5=8c2a13c80965d877e3189b8c68fdd515,IEEE Transactions on Intelligent Transportation Systems,2017
The impact of vehicular traffic demand on 5G caching architectures: A data-driven study,"The emergence of in-vehicle entertainment systems and self-driving vehicles, and the latters' need for high-resolution, up-to-date maps, will bring a further increase in the amount of data vehicles consume. Considering how difficult Wi-Fi offloading in vehicular environments is, the bulk of this additional load will be served by cellular networks. Cellular networks, in turn, will resort to caching at the network edge in order to reduce the strain on their core network – an approach also known as mobile edge computing, or “fog computing”. In this work, we exploit a real-world, large-scale trace coming from the users of the We-Fi app in order to (i) understand how significant the contribution of vehicular users is to the global traffic demand; (ii) compare the performance of different caching architectures; and (iii) studying how such a performance is influenced by recommendation systems and content locality. We express the price of “fog computing” through a metric called price-of-fog, accounting for the extra caches to deploy compared to a traditional, centralized approach. We find that “fog computing” allows a very significant reduction of the load on the core network, and the price thereof is low in all cases and becomes negligible if content demand is location specific. We can therefore conclude that vehicular networks make an excellent case for the transition to mobile-edge caching: thanks to the peculiar features of vehicular demand, we can obtain all the benefits of “fog computing”, including a reduction of the load on the core network – reducing the disadvantages to a minimum. © 2016 Elsevier Inc.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85008500263&doi=10.1016%2fj.vehcom.2016.11.007&partnerID=40&md5=b352f5e689f7836719ff3bf0f798b87a,Vehicular Communications,2017
HEX2OQTAL: Translational Optimal Control Exploiting Quaternion Error Dynamics,"The work presented in this paper is a ground-breaking initiative to design a translational optimal controller named HEX2OQTAL. The controller is capable of producing high precision translational tracking using a linearized model of a trajectory error based on a quaternion attitude representation. This control contribution is general in the sense that it is agnostic of the underlying vehicle; the results are presented for an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) experimentally, a spacecraft scenario in simulation, and a precision planetary landing scenario. The paper presents a full derivation from base principles, a proof of stability, and real-time repeatable experimental UAV results (25 tests per controller per scenario). These results show that the developed controller presented here is far more precise than the most common industry standard controllers, such as PID and classical LQR. The obtained results show the potential of this controller not only as an accurate and adaptable controller, but also in high precision trajectory tracking control. © 2017 IEEE.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85020752782&doi=10.1109%2fTAES.2017.2667958&partnerID=40&md5=ce43518a886037792a9bd2323aa50aa4,IEEE Transactions on Aerospace and Electronic Systems,2017
Energy Saving Through Traffic Profiling in Self-Optimizing Optical Networks,"An increasing fraction of the electrical energy produced in western countries is being consumed by Internet infrastructure; reducing its energy footprint is therefore of utmost importance for the scalability of the Internet. We address optical transport backbones and propose a novel method to reduce the energy consumed by dynamically adjusting the number of active optical carriers to support the short-term load of the network with a small and controllable margin. This is achieved in a nondisruptive manner that does not interact with routing strategies and does not rely on any specific control plane, but exploits automated traffic profiling and prediction of the well-known circadian traffic cycle. The proposed approach works with both fixed and flexible grid optical networks. We describe a method to automatically learn these patterns and multiple techniques to predict incoming traffic. Furthermore, we present an algorithm that tunes the parameters of the proposed system in order to achieve a target a posteriori probability of causing traffic losses. The behavior of the system is studied, using simulations, under a variety of conditions. Results show that the proposed prediction algorithms can significantly reduce the number of active optical carriers, even in nonoptimal scenarios, while guaranteeing low traffic losses. © 2016 IEEE.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85027458167&doi=10.1109%2fJSYST.2015.2476559&partnerID=40&md5=ded63296c1c461944165a1bed42ba98f,IEEE Systems Journal,2017
Cooperative GNSS positioning aided by road-features measurements,"Cooperation between road users through V2X communication is a way to improve GNSS localization accuracy. When vehicles localization systems involve standalone GNSS receivers, the resulting accuracy can be affected by satellite-specific errors of several meters. This paper studies how road-features like lane marking detected by on-board cameras can be exploited to reduce absolute position errors of cooperative vehicles sharing information in real-time in a network. The algorithms considered in this work are based on a error bounded set membership strategy. In every vehicle, a set membership algorithm computes the absolute position and an estimation of the satellite-specific errors by using raw GNSS pseudoranges, lane boundary measurements and a 2D georeferenced road map which provides absolute geometric constraints. As lane-boundary measurements provide essentially cross-track corrections in the position estimation process, cooperation enables the vehicles to improve their own estimates thanks to the different orientation of the roads. Set-membership methods are very efficient to solve this problem since they do not involve any independence hypothesis of the errors and so, the same information can be used several times in the computation. Such class of algorithm provides a novel approach to improve position accuracy for connected vehicles guaranteeing the integrity of the computed solution which is pivoting for automated automotive systems requiring guaranteed safety-critical solutions. Results from simulations and real experiments show that sharing position corrections reduces significantly satellite-specific GNSS errors effects in both cross-track and along-track components. Moreover, it is shown that lane-boundary measurements help reducing estimation errors for all the networked vehicles even those which are not equipped with an embedded perception system. © 2017",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85015951050&doi=10.1016%2fj.trc.2017.01.002&partnerID=40&md5=e2d8ec80470c097a84fb843d5c5dfcaf,Transportation Research Part C: Emerging Technologies,2017
Recognition of a landing platform for unmanned aerial vehicles by using computer vision-based techniques,"The use of Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) is growing significantly for many and varied purposes. During the mission, an outdoor UAV is guided by following the planned path using GPS signals. However, the GPS capability may become defective or the environment may be GPS-denied, and an additional safety aid is therefore required for the automatic landing phase that is independent of GPS data. Most UAVs are equipped with machine vision systems which, together with onboard analysis, can be used for safe, automatic landing. This contributes greatly to the overall success of autonomous flight. This paper proposes an automatic expert system, based on image segmentation procedures, that assists safe landing through recognition and relative orientation of the UAV and platform. The proposed expert system exploits the human experience that has been incorporated into the machine vision system, which is mapped into the proposed image processing modules. The result is an improved reliability capability that could be incorporated into any UAV, and is especially robust for rotary wing UAVs. This is clearly a desirable fail-safe capability. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85013188097&doi=10.1016%2fj.eswa.2017.01.017&partnerID=40&md5=461e009fcc244cc5700c4809d20837ce,Expert Systems with Applications,2017
Estimation of Synchromesh Frictional Torque and Output Torque in a Clutchless Automated Manual Transmission of a Parallel Hybrid Electric Vehicle,"This paper studies the estimation of the synchromesh frictional torque and the output torque of the integrated system of an electric motor and a clutchless automated manual transmission (AMT) as part of a two-shaft parallel hybrid electric vehicle powertrain. The case study powertrain is discussed, and the dynamical model of the powertrain from the electric motor to the AMT output shaft, where it is linked to the torque coupler, is developed constituting the basis for the observer design. Given the fact that the aforementioned torques are unknown inputs to the system, they are modeled as state variables of a fictitious unforced linear time-invariant system in order to be aggregated into the systems dynamics. For the augmented system of the actual and fictitious states, a deterministic Luenberger observer and a stochastic Kalman-Bucy filter (KBF) are designed to estimate the synchromesh frictional torque and the output torque of the AMT. The estimation is based on measuring angular velocities of the electric motor and the AMT output shaft, together with the imparted electromagnetic torque of the traction motor on the system. A set of experiments with distinct scenarios is performed to compare the performance of the designed observers and to quantify by how much the KBF can improve the root-mean-square error (RMSE) of the estimation by mitigating the effect of the process and measurement noises. Ultimately, after validation of the designed observers, the estimated value of the synchromesh frictional torque is exploited in a closed-loop feedback configuration in order to track desired trajectories such as step, ramp, and sinusoidal torque commands. © 1967-2012 IEEE.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85029650288&doi=10.1109%2fTVT.2016.2619915&partnerID=40&md5=a1918255e2245d188aeb998592e707aa,IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology,2017
Kernel-Function-Based Models for Acoustic Localization of Underwater Vehicles,"This paper proposes a novel design for the localization system of autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs) using acoustic signals. The solution presented exploits models based on kernel functions with two main purposes: 1) to reject outliers; and 2) to correct or improve accuracy of measurements. The localization system discussed is based on well-established techniques such as support vector data description (SVDD) and autoassociative kernel regression (AAKR) derived from machine learning theory that utilizes heuristic models for classification and regression tasks, respectively. By coupling the algorithm to the navigation system, we seek to reduce the sensitivity of the localization scheme to the reflected acoustic waves or fluctuations of underwater channel properties without modifying the solution used for data fusion or overloading the algorithm embedded in the vehicle. Data collected in the field with a light underwater vehicle (LAUV) were used to demonstrate the advantages of the proposed approach. © 1976-2012 IEEE.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84992416935&doi=10.1109%2fJOE.2016.2578218&partnerID=40&md5=cb907bd74d05588fdc601dc342ce9133,IEEE Journal of Oceanic Engineering,2017
A robust predictor–corrector entry guidance,"With the development of aerospace industry, the guidance system of an entry vehicle becomes more robust, reliable and autonomous. Based on fuzzy logic, a predictor–corrector guidance law is proposed in this paper, where the trajectory prediction is realized by numerical integration. The correction system consists of two fuzzy controllers, which correct longitudinal motion and lateral motion synergistically. A drag acceleration profile is designed through interpolating between upper drag boundary and lower drag boundary, which is corrected continually to eliminate the range error. Attack angle, a secondary control variable in the paper, is used to eliminate the altitude error. In addition, the lateral error is removed by regulating the reversal time of bank angle. Compared with the traditional guidance laws, the method in this paper not only can correct synergistically the longitudinal motion and lateral motion of the vehicle, but also can easily cope with the flight constraints using interpolated drag acceleration profile. Moreover, in a correction cycle, the method designed in this paper only needs a single trajectory prediction, which reduces the on-board computation. The guidance law demonstrates a high precision and robustness in the simulation scenario. © 2017 Elsevier Masson SAS",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85015862344&doi=10.1016%2fj.ast.2017.03.010&partnerID=40&md5=4ed941d972f44cc691e82ce327b13d93,Aerospace Science and Technology,2017
Analytical entry guidance based on pseudo-aerodynamic profiles,"An autonomous entry guidance is developed for a hypersonic glide vehicle with high Lift-to-Drag ratio (L/D) based on 3-D analytical glide formulas. To compensate the effects of the Earth's rotation, the pseudo-aerodynamic forces are introduced as the fusions of the aerodynamic forces and inertial forces due to the Earth's rotation. To avoid drastic changes in Angle of Attack (AOA) and bank angle, we carefully forecast the change trends of the inertial forces and then design the pseudo-aerodynamic profiles as inversely proportional functions. Here a complex but useful identity is found and proved theoretically, which helps to simplify the pseudo-aerodynamic profiles without losing accuracy significantly. Subsequently, new 3-D analytical glide formulas are derived for these inversely-proportional profiles and then used to determine the profile parameters and bank reversals. Due to the careful design, the guidance is capable of steering the high-L/D vehicle to any place on the Earth accurately while achieving almost constant commands during the steady glide phase, a major phase of flight. The superior performance of the guidance is verified by the Monte Carlo simulations with challenging disturbances including initial state dispersions, aerodynamic uncertainties, and atmospheric perturbations. © 2017 Elsevier Masson SAS",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85016492831&doi=10.1016%2fj.ast.2017.03.018&partnerID=40&md5=e1e2f89807b38f73f1d19048985316ec,Aerospace Science and Technology,2017
Exploiting antenna motion for faster initialization of centimeter-accurate gnss positioning with low-cost antennas,"This paper investigates the effectiveness of multipath-decorrelating antenna motion in reducing the initialization time of global navigation satellite system (GNSS) receivers employing low-cost single-frequency antennas for carrier-phase differential GNSS (CDGNSS) positioning. Fast initialization times with low-cost antennas will encourage the expansion of CDGNSS into the mass market, bringing the benefits of globally referenced centimeter-accurate positioning to many consumer applications, such as augmented reality and autonomous vehicles, that have so far been hampered by the several-meter-level errors of traditional GNSS positioning. Poor multipath suppression common to low-cost antennas results in large and strongly time-correlated phase errors when a receiver is static. Such errors can result in the CDGNSS initialization time, the so-called time to ambiguity resolution (TAR), extending to hundreds of seconds - many times longer than for higher cost survey-grade antennas, which have substantially better multipath suppression. This paper demonstrates that TAR can be significantly reduced through antenna motion, particularly gentle wavelength-scale random antenna motion. Such motion acts to decrease the correlation time of the multipath-induced phase errors. A priori knowledge of the motion profile is shown to further reduce TAR, with the reduction shown to be more pronounced as the initialization scenario is more challenging. © 1965-2011 IEEE.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85029581711&doi=10.1109%2fTAES.2017.2665221&partnerID=40&md5=d6a501dfcfc1ff91fc1b36012f5d83a2,IEEE Transactions on Aerospace and Electronic Systems,2017

Coevolutionary multitasking for concurrent global optimization: With case studies in complex engineering design,"Recent research efforts have provided hints towards the innate ability of population-based evolutionary algorithms to tackle multiple distinct optimization tasks at once by combining them into a single unified search space. On the occasion that there emerges some form of complementarity between the tasks in the unified space, multitask optimization can bring about favourable leaps in the genetic lineage through automated gene transfer, thereby leading to notably accelerated convergence characteristics. In this paper, we further emphasize the efficacy of multitasking across problems through an algorithmic realization based on a coevolutionary framework. It is contended that the mechanics of cooperative coevolution are particularly well suited for exploiting the commonalities and/or complementarities between different (yet possibly related) optimization tasks in a single multitasking environment. To this end, we label the resultant approach as coevolutionary multitasking for concurrent global optimization. Further, in order to effectively navigate continuous search spaces of varying degrees of complexity, we employ the particle swarm algorithm as a sample instantiation of a base optimizer for a real-parameter unification scheme. Based on a series of numerical experiments carried out for synthetic functions as well as real-world optimization settings in engineering design, we demonstrate the efficacy of multitask optimization as a paradigm promising enhanced productivity in future decision making processes. © 2017",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85020849064&doi=10.1016%2fj.engappai.2017.05.008&partnerID=40&md5=0194f1cf1e9686cf7cd0308916e46958,Engineering Applications of Artificial Intelligence,2017
Lane Determination with GPS Precise Point Positioning,"Modern intelligent transport solutions can achieve an improvement of traffic flow on motorways. With lane-specific measurements and lane-specific control, more measures are possible. Single frequency precise point positioning (PPP) is a newly developed and affordable technique to achieve an improved position accuracy compared with global positioning system (GPS) standalone positioning. GPS-PPP allows for sub-meter accurate positioning, in real time, of vehicles on a motorway. This paper tests this technique in real life; moreover, it presents a methodology to map the lanes on a motorway using data collected by this technique. The methodology exploits the high accuracy and the fact that the most driving is within a lane. In a field test, a GPS-PPP equipped vehicle drives a specific motorway stretch 100 times, for which the GPS-PPP trajectory data are collected. Using these data, the positions and the widths of different lanes are successfully estimated. Comparison with the ground truth shows a dm accuracy. With the parametrized lanes, vehicles can be tracked down to a lane with the GPS-PPP device. © 2000-2011 IEEE.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85012951183&doi=10.1109%2fTITS.2016.2632751&partnerID=40&md5=b7055ccf837d7992cb18ddfe7ed52cf2,IEEE Transactions on Intelligent Transportation Systems,2017
Combined Speed and Steering Control in High-Speed Autonomous Ground Vehicles for Obstacle Avoidance Using Model Predictive Control,"This paper presents a model predictive control-based obstacle avoidance algorithm for autonomous ground vehicles at high speed in unstructured environments. The novelty of the algorithm is its capability to control the vehicle to avoid obstacles at high speed taking into account dynamical safety constraints through a simultaneous optimization of reference speed and steering angle without a priori knowledge about the environment and without a reference trajectory to follow. Previous work in this specific context optimized only the steering command. In this paper, obstacles are detected using a planar light detection and ranging sensor. A multi-phase optimal control problem is then formulated to simultaneously optimize the reference speed and steering angle within the detection range. Vehicle acceleration capability as a function of speed, as well as stability and handling concerns such as preventing wheel lift-off, are included as constraints in the optimization problem, whereas the cost function is formulated to navigate the vehicle as quickly as possible with smooth control commands. Simulation results show that the proposed algorithm is capable of safely exploiting the dynamic limits of the vehicle while navigating the vehicle through sensed obstacles of different sizes and numbers. It is also shown that the proposed variable speed formulation can significantly improve performance by allowing navigation of obstacle fields that would otherwise not be cleared with steering control alone. © 1967-2012 IEEE.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85035761022&doi=10.1109%2fTVT.2017.2707076&partnerID=40&md5=260b5befb2fa64b64f3d4db36fa2b0a2,IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology,2017
Secure State Estimation for Cyber-Physical Systems under Sensor Attacks: A Satisfiability Modulo Theory Approach,"Secure state estimation is the problem of estimating the state of a dynamical system from a set of noisy and adversarially corrupted measurements. Intrinsically a combinatorial problem, secure state estimation has been traditionally addressed either by brute force search, suffering from scalability issues, or via convex relaxations, using algorithms that can terminate in polynomial time but are not necessarily sound. In this paper, we present a novel algorithm that uses a satisfiability modulo theory approach to harness the complexity of secure state estimation. We leverage results from formal methods over real numbers to provide guarantees on the soundness and completeness of our algorithm. Moreover, we discuss its scalability properties, by providing upper bounds on the runtime performance. Numerical simulations support our arguments by showing an order of magnitude decrease in execution time with respect to alternative techniques. Finally, the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm is demonstrated by applying it to the problem of controlling an unmanned ground vehicle. © 1963-2012 IEEE.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85030997173&doi=10.1109%2fTAC.2017.2676679&partnerID=40&md5=db2e6b6bf73f7e622380fa3fe9869ad2,IEEE Transactions on Automatic Control,2017
Control of a City Road Network: Distributed Exact Verification of Traffic Safety,"A least-restrictive supervisor for vehicle collision avoidance is a control algorithm that can detect an unsafe maneuver by a set of human-driven or autonomous vehicles, intervening with a corrective action only when needed to avoid a collision. It can help prevent collisions, and facilitate coexistence of autonomous and human-driven vehicles. Such an algorithm is based on a formal verification problem which, unfortunately, is known to be NP-hard in many cases of interest, for instance at traffic intersections. Here, we propose a strategy to dynamically decompose the formal verification problem of a large road network, exploiting vehicle dynamics and the constraints induced by road topology to separate nonconflicting vehicles. We split the global problem into smaller and treatable subproblems, while still allowing to compute an exact solution. We illustrate our results on three different scenarios. © 1963-2012 IEEE.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85031042908&doi=10.1109%2fTAC.2017.2676464&partnerID=40&md5=82be381bd109654043ac82b922e4e29b,IEEE Transactions on Automatic Control,2017
Robust Trajectory Tracking Control for Small-Scale Unmanned Helicopters with Model Uncertainties,"This paper addresses the trajectory tracking control problem for small-scale unmanned helicopters with model uncertainties. In particular, we propose a robust control scheme that is decomposed into a position and an attitude control modules, operating in a cascaded form, and does not depend on the explicit knowledge of the value of the model parameters. Exploiting the concepts and techniques of prescribed performance control, each module guarantees trajectory tracking with prescribed transient and steady-state response, despite the presence of external disturbances, such as wind gusts and ground effect phenomena. Additionally, a novel reformulation of the translational dynamics reveals a sufficient condition for closed-loop stability and allows us to extract the appropriate attitude commands straightforwardly. Moreover, the derived control algorithms are of low complexity and thus can be efficiently implemented on low-cost, aerial embedded systems of limited power and computational resources. Finally, the efficacy of the proposed control scheme is verified via extensive experimental studies using an autonomous small-scale helicopter. © 2017 IEEE.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85008500844&doi=10.1109%2fTCST.2016.2642160&partnerID=40&md5=76bdbe93058dc4f114cb5b210408f1c1,IEEE Transactions on Control Systems Technology,2017
Numerical analysis of stability and manoeuvrability of Autonomous Underwater Vehicles (AUV) with fishtail shape,"This paper aims to understand the stability and the manoeuvrability of an Autonomous Underwater Vehicles (AUV) through the simulation of the drag, lift and torque acting on the hull by the passing seawater. These are important questions in deep water conditions where telecommand is impracticable. The present study is based on the behaviour of a stern shaped as a fishtail in three different ways, and considers several attack angles. The solutions of the Navier-Stokes equations are computed with the OpenFOAM library. An open source library based on the Finite Volume Method (FVM) using C++ language. An analysis of the effects of the fishtail shape on the resistance and stability is based on the calculation of the averages drag, lift and torque.

Cyber Threats Facing Autonomous and Connected Vehicles: Future Challenges,"Vehicles are currently being developed and sold with increasing levels of connectivity and automation. As with all networked computing devices, increased connectivity often results in a heightened risk of a cyber security attack. Furthermore, increased automation exacerbates any risk by increasing the opportunities for the adversary to implement a successful attack. In this paper, a large volume of publicly accessible literature is reviewed and compartmentalized based on the vulnerabilities identified and mitigation techniques developed. This review highlighted that the majority of studies are reactive and vulnerabilities are often discovered by friendly adversaries (white-hat hackers). Many gaps in the knowledge base were identified. Priority should be given to address these knowledge gaps to minimize future cyber security risks in the connected and autonomous vehicle sector. © 2011 IEEE.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85014851084&doi=10.1109%2fTITS.2017.2665968&partnerID=40&md5=2a5cf19a16f47ccf1aa82852a4fd8078,IEEE Transactions on Intelligent Transportation Systems,2017
Approach Modeling and Control of an Autonomous Maneuverable Space Net,"The autonomous maneuverable space net, which consists of a flexible net and several maneuverable units, is a promising solution for the active removal of space debris. A novel dynamics model and a corresponding controller are proposed in this paper to resolve the approach control problem. Given that the net tethers cannot be elongated, interval functions and corresponding constraint forces are exploited to model the unilaterally constrained tethers. The proposed approach dynamics model, which is based on the Hamilton principle, includes distinctive velocity jump phenomena. A dual-loop control scheme with double optimization pseudo-dynamics inversion and sliding mode control is also established. Simulation results validate the feasibility of the proposed control scheme. The net can fly along the expected trajectory without suffering unexpected net deformation or orbital radial movement. © 1965-2011 IEEE.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85023185213&doi=10.1109%2fTAES.2017.2709794&partnerID=40&md5=c39f3dfba9bc8faa62731974db128327,IEEE Transactions on Aerospace and Electronic Systems,2017
Nonlinear guidance and fuzzy control for three-dimensional path following of an underactuated autonomous underwater vehicle,"This paper proposes a simplified nonlinear fuzzy controller integrating an improved three-dimensional (3D) guidance law, in order to address the problem of path following for an underactuated autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV) exposed to unknown environmental disturbances. First, an improved 3D line-of-sight guidance law that makes full use of the essentially equivalent coordinate transformation is derived to transform 3D path following position errors into controlled guidance speeds, which also reduces the path following system form second-order to first-order. The side-slip angle and angle of attack are integrated into 3D guidance design to account for the underactuated configuration in sway and heave. Second, a nonlinear single-input fuzzy controller is designed to reduce computation complexity resulting from square rules in a double-input fuzzy controller, and to force the steerable speeds of an AUV to attain their guidance profiles. Subsequently, sensitivity analysis is adopted to suggest that the nonlinear fuzzy design with the convergent distribution and small slope for the single input have better robustness against unknown disturbances than the linear design. Finally, numerical examples with quantitative comparison are provided to illustrate the performance of the nonlinear single-input fuzzy controller for 3D path following of an underactuated AUV exposed to unknown environmental disturbances. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85037059632&doi=10.1016%2fj.oceaneng.2017.10.001&partnerID=40&md5=fa70169ab7bec8869c7cbb2f5ced58f1,Ocean Engineering,2017
UAVs cooperative attack based on Archimedes spiral,"This paper investigates a control of track based on Archimedes spiral. The objective is to control UAVs (Unmanned Aerial Vehicle) circled to the target under the preset track and in a certain time interval. For the circumstance of the known location of start point and target point of UAV, we put forward a control method of angular velocity, with fixed velocity and trajectory of UAV. And in this control method, based on the nature of the Archimedes spiral, the time of UAV from the start point to the target point can be accurately calculated. © 2017 Institute of Control, Robotics and Systems - ICROS.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85044467847&doi=10.23919%2fICCAS.2017.8204379&partnerID=40&md5=e5c37b6d0b9ee4cbf7d9d8c1e1f2fa74,"International Conference on Control, Automation and Systems",2017
Experimental and numerical investigation of flight dynamics of a generic lambda wing configuration,"The development and comparison of aerodynamic simulation models for the inclusion in an open-loop stability & control model based on both experimental and numerical data are presented. Specifically, the work is focused on the effectiveness of the Kestrel simulation tools in replicating the aerodynamic coefficient data from wind tunnel experiments of a generic lambda wing configuration with four trailing edge control surfaces. Simulation conditions correspond to the angles of attack in range of −5∘ to 10∘ at assumed cruise Mach number of 0.7. These simulations include a clean configuration with no control surface deflection and when inboard/outboard control surfaces are deflected −10∘, −5∘, 5∘, and 10∘. Single and overset grids are used to simulate the control surface deflections. Predicted aerodynamic data are collected in form of look-up tables and are run in a Matlab/Simulink program to determine stability and control properties of the vehicle. The vehicle stability and control characteristics are then compared with the results of running experimental coefficient values through the same program. The results show that numerical predictions of the test case considered depend heavily on the geometry details and numerical setup, e.g. turbulence modeling, grid refinement, integration scheme, time step, etc. and therefore do not match experimental data at all tested conditions. In addition, the stability and control investigation of the vehicle using these data confirms that the differences between simulations and measurements could lead to significant changes in the evaluation of vehicle's stability and control characteristics. The simulation predictions of this work, therefore, cannot fully replace the need for experiments to determine the vehicle's stability and control, however they help to provide insight into flow physics and to direct/make best use of wind tunnel experiments. © 2017",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85032171792&doi=10.1016%2fj.ast.2017.10.011&partnerID=40&md5=899798dc949ad6a287fe9b90b118e5d6,Aerospace Science and Technology,2017
Using Extreme Value Theory for Vehicle Level Safety Validation and Implications for Autonomous Vehicles,"Much effort is put right now into how to make autonomous vehicles as capable as possible in order to be able to replace humans as drivers. Less focus is put into how to ensure that this transition happens in a safe way that we can put trust in. The verification of the extreme dependability requirements connected to safety is expected to be one of the largest challenges to overcome in the commercialization of autonomous vehicles. Using traditional statistical methods to validate complete vehicle safety would require the vehicle to cover extreme distances to show that collisions occur rare enough. However, recent research has shown the possibility of using near-collisions in order to estimate the frequency of actual collisions using Extreme Value Theory. To use this method, there is a need for a measure related to the closeness of a collision. This paper shows that the choice of this threat measure has a significant impact on the inferences drawn from the data. With the right measure, this method can be used to validate the safety of a vehicle. This, while keeping the validity high and the data required lower than the state of the art statistical methods. © 2016 IEEE.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85051074393&doi=10.1109%2fTIV.2017.2768219&partnerID=40&md5=d4cae579d06eb895e948f32880dde9a3,IEEE Transactions on Intelligent Vehicles,2017
Traffic light recognition exploiting map and localization at every stage,"Traffic light recognition is being intensively researched for the purpose of reducing traffic accidents at intersections and realizing autonomous driving. However, conventional vision-based approaches have several limitations due to full image scanning, always-on operation, various different types of traffic lights, and complex driving environments. In particular, it might be impossible to recognize a relevant traffic light among multiple traffic lights at multiple intersections. To overcome such limitations, we propose an effective architecture that integrates a vision system with an accurate positioning system and an extended digital map. The recognition process is divided into four stages and we suggest an extended methodology for each stage. These stages are: ROI generation, detection, classification, and tracking. The 3D positions of traffic lights and slope information obtained from an extended digital map enable ROIs to be generated accurately, even on slanted roads, while independent design and implementation of individual recognition modules for detection and classification allow for selection according to the type of traffic light face. Such a modular architecture gives the system simplicity, flexibility, and maintainable algorithms. In addition, adaptive tracking that exploits the distance to traffic lights allows for seamless state estimation through smooth data association when measurements change from long to short ranges. Evaluation of the proposed system occurred at six test sites and utilized two different types of traffic lights, seven states, sloped roads, and various environmental complexities. The experimental results show that the proposed system can recognize traffic lights with 98.68% precision, 92.73% recall, and 95.52% accuracy in the 10.02–81.21 m range. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85024401537&doi=10.1016%2fj.eswa.2017.07.003&partnerID=40&md5=123237773196ca8c20456b12494ec670,Expert Systems with Applications,2017
Object Matching for Inter-Vehicle Communication Systems-An IMM-Based Track Association Approach with Sequential Multiple Hypothesis Test,"Autonomous driving poses unique challenges for vehicle environment perception due to the complex driving environment where the autonomous vehicle interacts with surrounding traffic participants. Due to the limited capability of any sensor perception system, it is highly desirable that an autonomous driving vehicle could use not only information from onboard sensors (say, radar/camera/lidar) but also from remote (network) information via inter-vehicle communication systems. The collaborative information from cooperative/non-cooperative remote vehicles (along with the onboard sensor data) could substantially improve the vehicle decision making process and push autonomous driving to be safer and more reliable. Inter-vehicle communication technologies are at the stage of development for market introduction, after years of research and standardization. In this paper, we setup a dedicated short range communication (DSRC) system to provide a low-latency inter-vehicle wireless communication channel. The task is to build a record linkage between the onboard sensor data and the corresponding DSRC-transmitted remote vehicle information when both sets belong to the same object, for the purpose of enhancing host vehicle environment perceiving capability and reliability. This is a typical data association problem. The challenges mainly lie in the inherent uncertain nature of the observation data and the practical issues that information often suffers from delays and drops. We propose a track-based association approach using an interacting multiple model estimator with a sequential multiple hypothesis test (denoted as IMM-SMHT) as an ubiquitous solution to handle different situations in complicated driving scenarios. To fully exploit the potential of such a system, only position information (from the DSRC channel and onboard radar system) is used for the object matching purpose-we try to use the least amount of information to achieve a high association accuracy; additional information can be used but not currently considered. We aim to provide a real world solution, and therefore, a prototype vehicle system is built with practical consideration on market availability, cost, and sensor limitations. We design meaningful use cases for creating functionality modules from a systematic point of view. The inter-vehicle information fusion system based on the track fusion approach using the IMM-SMHT is tested in real traffic on the U.S. roads and shows promising object matching performance of significant practical feasibility. © 2000-2011 IEEE.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85030643534&doi=10.1109%2fTITS.2017.2723894&partnerID=40&md5=56f1963602bd00c6fb1a80862139fdf2,IEEE Transactions on Intelligent Transportation Systems,2017
Incorporating building information to globalize and robustify grid-based indoor SLAM,"Navigation is one of the key topics in the field of mobile robotics. In many areas of application like Industry 4.0 or fully automated parking, additional external sensors are available as well as pre-existing knowledge about the general building structure. This information is of significant advantage, especially in situations where the perceptive field of the mobile platform is occluded. One method to gain the required information is the probabilistic concept of simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM). However, most existing approaches generally lack the possibility to incorporate preexisting and external information. In this paper, a solution to the SLAM problem based on a Rao-Blackwellized particle filter is adopted to provide efficient means for exploiting such data. We present an approach that directly incorporates environment knowledge using a context-aware environment model, while establishing reference to a global coordinate frame allowing for a straight-forward fusion with external information sources. The evaluation is performed on real-world data obtained by a mobile platform. The qualitative analysis shows significant improvement in map quality and robustness regarding short sensor outages or reduced perception rates. Establishing a uniform reference frame and reusing data, the proposed approach clearly extends the functional range of SLAM, demonstrating substantial advantages over existing methods. © 2017 Institute of Control, Robotics and Systems - ICROS.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85044442232&doi=10.23919%2fICCAS.2017.8204278&partnerID=40&md5=3172cdc6922e9cf70c165b29e7576174,"International Conference on Control, Automation and Systems",2017
Certified Adversarial Robustness for Deep Reinforcement Learning,"Deep Neural Network-based systems are now the state-of-the-art in many robotics tasks, but their application in safety-critical domains remains dangerous without formal guarantees on network robustness. Small perturbations to sensor inputs (from noise or adversarial examples) are often enough to change network-based decisions, which was already shown to cause an autonomous vehicle to swerve into oncoming traffic. In light of these dangers, numerous algorithms have been developed as defensive mechanisms from these adversarial inputs, some of which provide formal robustness guarantees or certificates. This work leverages research on certified adversarial robustness to develop an online certified defense for deep reinforcement learning algorithms. The proposed defense computes guaranteed lower bounds on state-action values during execution to identify and choose the optimal action under a worst-case deviation in input space due to possible adversaries or noise. The approach is demonstrated on a Deep Q-Network policy and is shown to increase robustness to noise and adversaries in pedestrian collision avoidance scenarios and a classic control task. © 2019 CoRL.

Toward a Generic Diver-Following Algorithm: Balancing Robustness and Efficiency in Deep Visual Detection,"This letter explores the design and development of a class of robust diver detection algorithms for autonomous diver-following applications. By considering the operational challenges for underwater visual tracking in diverse real-world settings, we formulate a set of desired features of a generic diver-following algorithm. We attempt to accommodate these features and maximize general tracking performance by exploiting the state-of-the-art deep object detection models. We fine tune the building blocks of these models with a goal of balancing the tradeoff between robustness and efficiency in an on-board setting under real-time constraints. Subsequently, we design an architecturally simple convolutional neural network based diver detection model that is much faster than the state-of-the-art deep models yet provides comparable detection performances.

"Learning Driver Braking Behavior Using Smartphones, Neural Networks and the Sliding Correlation Coefficient: Road Anomaly Case Study","This paper focuses on the automated learning of driver braking 'signature' in the presence of road anomalies. Our motivation is to improve driver experience using preview information from navigation maps. Smartphones facilitate, due to their unprecedented market penetration, the large-scale deployment of advanced driver assistance systems. On the other hand, it is challenging to exploit smartphone sensor data because of the fewer and lower quality signals, compared to the ones on board. Methods for detecting braking behavior using smartphones exist, however, most of them focus only on harsh events. Additionally, only a few studies correlate longitudinal driving behavior with the road condition. In this paper, a new method, based on deep neural networks and the sliding correlation coefficient, is proposed for the spatio-temporal correlation of road anomalies and driver behavior. A unique deep neural network structure, that requires minimum tuning, is proposed. Extensive field trials were conducted and vehicle motion was recorded using smartphones and a data acquisition system, comprising an inertial measurement unit and differential GPS. The proposed method was validated using the probabilistic Receiver Operating Characteristics method. The method proves to be a robust and flexible tool for self-learning driver behavior. © 2000-2011 IEEE.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85042191360&doi=10.1109%2fTITS.2018.2797943&partnerID=40&md5=34c437a3b7860384cf44e865f57b3560,IEEE Transactions on Intelligent Transportation Systems,2019

Attitude estimation for cooperating UAVs based on tight integration of GNSS and vision measurements,"This paper presents a cooperative navigation approach for Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) that allows robust and accurate attitude determination for a chief vehicle flying in formation with other deputy UAVs. The proposed method is based on a tightly coupled Extended Kalman Filter (EKF) that exploits the spatial diversity of measurements coming from Global Navigation Satellite Systems (GNSS) receivers and a vision system, which are integrated with inertial and magnetic sensor data. The focus is set on outdoor environments and the innovative idea is to extend attitude estimation approaches based on multiple GNSS antennas, to a multi-vehicle system where differential-GNSS and vision-based UAV-to-UAV tracking are exploited to build a virtual additional navigation sensor. Concept and processing architecture are described with emphasis on the EKF measurement update phase which is applicable for any number of cooperating deputies, and for different GNSS processing architectures. Performance of the proposed method is assessed through experimental tests involving two multi-rotors and two fixed ground antennas, one of which is used as Ground Control Point for pointing accuracy analysis.

Design and evaluation of UAV flow angle estimation filters,"This paper presents the design, implementation, and evaluation of four filters for the estimation of angle of attack (AOA) and angle of sideslip (AOS) of small unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs). Specifically, two novel filters (a complementary filter and an extended Kalman filter) are proposed and evaluated without using direct flow angle and Global Positioning System measurements; two existing AOA/AOS filters are also implemented and evaluated. All filters are designed with minimal inputs and states to ensure the ease of implementation, simplicity of tuning, and computation efficiency. Both simulation and UAV flight test results show the performance of the proposed filters. Especially, flight test results from two different UAVs (a T-tail UAV and a flying wing UAV) show that the root mean square errors of estimated inertial AOA and AOS are less than 1.5° under nominal flight conditions and around 2° under aggressive maneuvers compared with direct flow angle measurements. © 1965-2011 IEEE.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85049301344&doi=10.1109%2fTAES.2018.2852359&partnerID=40&md5=4d3859c6d7afefc50911674d46afdb77,IEEE Transactions on Aerospace and Electronic Systems,2019
An empirical air-to-ground channel model based on passive measurements in LTE,"In this paper, a recently conducted measurement campaign for unmanned-aerial-vehicle channels is introduced. The downlink signals of an in-service long-time-evolution network, which is deployed in a suburban scenario were acquired. Five horizontal and five vertical flight routes were considered. The channel impulse responses (CIRs) are extracted from the received data by exploiting the cell-specific signals, and the underlying physical propagation mechanisms are interpreted by exploiting the propagation graph modeling approach. Based on the CIRs, the parameters of multipath components are estimated by using a high-resolution algorithm derived according to the space-alternating generalized expectation-maximization (SAGE) principle.

PHY-Layer Cover-Free Coding for Wireless Pilot Authentication in IoV Communications: Protocol Design and Ultra-Security Proof,"Wireless channel state information (CSI) from intelligent vehicles to the roadside unit (RSU) is a must for vehicle-to-infrastructure (V2I) communications in Internet of Vehicles, but easily suffers the risks of being attacked due to the publicly known and deterministic characteristic of PHY-layer pilots that are employed for CSI acquisition. This incurs the issue of wireless pilot authentication (WPA), that is, verifying the authenticity of pilots and claimed CSIs. In this paper, we, for multiantenna V2I orthogonal frequency division multiplexed communications, develop a PHY-layer cover-free (PHY-CF) coding theory to build up a secure WPA (SWPA) protocol. Here, we encode and convey vehicle pilot signals into diversified subcarrier activation patterns (SAPs) on the time-frequency domain by employing cover-free coding. We redesign the decoding procedure using the signal independence characteristic such that those encoded SAPs, though camouflaged by malicious signals and superimposed onto each other in wireless environment, could be separated, identified and decoded into the original pilots securely. For this protocol, we prove that perfect pilot conveying and separation could be both guaranteed. We formulate the pilot identification error probability (IEP) and show how PHY-CF coding could help position the location of attacker and reduce IEP to further achieve ultrasecurity. Considering 20 MHz long-term evolution bandwidth, we prove that the number of co-time co-frequency vehicles that are securely authenticated achieves up to 19\,\,{\times }\,\, {X} for X serving sectors of base station type RSU and the latency time of uplink data access is up to 1.5 ms, thus furthering the autonomous driving.

Parcel delivery in urban areas: Opportunities and threats for the mix of traditional and green business models,"In recent years, the role of freight transportation and parcel delivery in urban areas has increased, supporting the economic and social development of cities. At the same time, the industry is affected by various issues, inefficiencies, and externalities, particularly in the last-mile segment. As such, there is an emerging awareness of a need to improve urban mobility and transportation, making them more sustainable and competitive by mixing traditional and emerging technologies, such as cargo bikes, autonomous vehicles, and drones. In contrast, the complexity of the overall system, characterized by multiple actors with conflicting goals, requires a strategy that harmonizes these actors’ business and operational models. This study contributes in this direction along three axes. First, it defines the main actors involved in urban parcel delivery, and then analyzes their business models and the interactions between them. Second, it investigates the integration of traditional and green logistics (mainly cycle-logistics), from both business and operational perspectives, in order to identify synergies, conflicts, and the operational and economic consequences of adopting green vehicles. Third, it introduces a simulation-optimization decision support system tool capable of assessing mixed-fleet policies for the management of parcel delivery in urban areas. Finally, the decision support system is tested using real data of the city of Turin. © 2019",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85059748376&doi=10.1016%2fj.trc.2019.01.006&partnerID=40&md5=d3e4dff73f3c15f4aef3a86b7a1af5cc,Transportation Research Part C: Emerging Technologies,2019
The effects of free stream turbulence on the hydrodynamic characteristics of an AUV hull form,"This article presents experimental and numerical studies on the effect of free stream turbulence (FST) on evolution of flow over an autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV) hull form at three Reynolds numbers with different submergence depths and angles of attack. The experiments were conducted in a recirculating water tank and the instantaneous velocity profiles were recorded along the AUV using Acoustic Doppler Velocimetry (ADV). The experimental results of stream-wise mean velocity, turbulent kinetic energy (TKE) and Reynolds stresses were used to validate the predictive capability of a Reynolds stress model (RSM) with the wall reflection term of the pressure strain correlation. From the high fidelity RSM based simulations it is observed that in presence of free stream turbulence, the pressure, skin friction, drag and lift coefficients decrease on the AUV hull. The variation of the hydrodynamic coefficients were also plotted along the AUV hull for different values of submergence depth and angle of attack with different levels of free stream turbulence. The conclusions from this experimental and numerical investigation give guidance for improved design paradigms for the design of AUVs. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85060869115&doi=10.1016%2fj.oceaneng.2019.01.039&partnerID=40&md5=fc7213ae800abb13d4b6673b12d53d27,Ocean Engineering,2019
A Robust Load Balancing and Routing Protocol for Intra-Car Hybrid Wired/Wireless Networks,"With the emergence of connected and autonomous vehicles, sensors are increasingly deployed within cars to support new functionalities. Traffic generated by these sensors congest traditional intra-car networks, such as CAN buses. Furthermore, the large amount of wires needed to connect sensors makes it harder to design cars in a modular way. To alleviate these limitations, we propose, simulate, and implement a hybrid wired/wireless architecture, in which each node is connected to either a wired interface or a wireless interface or both. Specifically, we propose a new protocol, called Hybrid-Backpressure Collection Protocol (Hybrid-BCP), to efficiently collect data from sensors in intra-car networks. Hybrid-BCP is backward-compatible with the CAN bus technology, and builds on the BCP protocol, designed for wireless sensor networks. We theoretically prove that an idealized version of Hybrid-BCP achieves optimal throughput. Our testbed implementation, based on CAN and ZigBee transceivers, demonstrates the load balancing and routing functionalities of Hybrid-BCP and its resilience to DoS attacks and wireless jamming attacks. We further provide simulation results, obtained with the ns-3 simulator and based on real intra-car RSSI traces, that compare between the performance of Hybrid-BCP and a tree-based data collection protocol. Notably, the simulations show that Hybrid-BCP outperforms the tree-based protocol on throughput by 12 percent. The results also show that Hybrid-BCP maintains high packet delivery rate and low packet delay for safety-critical sensors that are directly connected to the sink through wire. © 2002-2012 IEEE.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85046336769&doi=10.1109%2fTMC.2018.2832208&partnerID=40&md5=0b90288066341f5e582ec882db861e7a,IEEE Transactions on Mobile Computing,2019
Human-Centered Risk Assessment of an Automated Vehicle Using Vehicular Wireless Communication,"This paper presents a human-centered risk assessment algorithm using vehicular communication for application to an automated driving vehicle. Vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) wireless communication has been implemented and fused with a radar sensor to obtain the prediction of the remote vehicle's motion. Based on the predicted behavior of remote vehicles, a collision risk and a human reaction time are determined for a human-centered active safety control intervention moment. The human-centered risk assessment algorithm has been incorporated into a collision avoidance algorithm to monitor threat vehicles ahead and to find the best intervention point. Effects of the vehicular communication on a perception and a control performance are investigated. The performance of the proposed algorithm has been investigated via computer simulations and vehicle tests. It has been shown from both simulations and vehicle tests that the proposed human-centered risk assessment algorithm with V2V communication decides a proper active safety intervention moment by reducing the chances of over/underestimate of a conventional radar-only system. © 2000-2011 IEEE.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85046362398&doi=10.1109%2fTITS.2018.2823744&partnerID=40&md5=62d87dd7af7a3e9a34b37c54277b34f4,IEEE Transactions on Intelligent Transportation Systems,2019
Collision Avoidance: A Literature Review on Threat-Assessment Techniques,"For the last few decades, a lot of attention has been given to intelligent vehicle systems, and in particular to automated safety and collision avoidance solutions. In this paper, we present a literature review and analysis of threat-assessment methods used for collision avoidance. We will cover algorithms that are based on single-behavior threat metrics, optimization methods, formal methods, probabilistic frameworks, and data driven approaches, i.e., machine learning.

Machine Learning Inspired Sound-Based Amateur Drone Detection for Public Safety Applications,"In recent years, popularity of unmanned air vehicles enormously increased due to their autonomous moving capability and applications in various domains. This also results in some serious security threats, that needs proper investigation and timely detection of the amateur drones (ADr) to protect the security sensitive institutions. In this paper, we propose the novel machine learning (ML) framework for detection and classification of ADr sounds out of the various sounds like bird, airplanes, and thunderstorm in the noisy environment. To extract the necessary features from ADr sound, Mel frequency cepstral coefficients (MFCC), and linear predictive cepstral coefficients (LPCC) feature extraction techniques are implemented. After feature extraction, support vector machines (SVM) with various kernels are adopted to accurately classify these sounds. The experimental results verify that SVM cubic kernel with MFCC outperform LPCC method by achieving around 96.7% accuracy for ADr detection. Moreover, the results verified that the proposed ML scheme has more than 17% detection accuracy, compared with correlation-based drone sound detection scheme that ignores ML prediction. © 1967-2012 IEEE.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85063268841&doi=10.1109%2fTVT.2019.2893615&partnerID=40&md5=67048e28db8737300a105a236a170928,IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology,2019
Autonomous temperature-based orbit estimation,"Orbit estimation (OE) is a required significant task in almost all space missions. Accordingly, a wide variety of sensors and estimation algorithms have been developed within the last few decades to this aim. However, the current study proposes a novel autonomous OE method that is purely based on temperature data of six orthogonal surfaces of a three-axis stabilized satellite as it orbits around the Earth. While the utility of satellite surface temperature data has been recently investigated for satellite attitude estimation (AE) assuming its navigational information, the present paper is focused on OE via only temperature data that has not been attended to in the related literature. To this end, it is assumed that satellite surfaces are equipped with small plates that are thermally isolated from the internal heat sources so that their temperature changes mainly arise from environmental radiation emanated mainly from the Sun and the Earth. In this sense, a thermal model is developed and demonstrated to show how the satellite surface temperatures and their time rates are the only ingredients needed, as measurement quantities, for the proposed OE method to produce the satellite navigational data in terms of its position and velocity vectors. In addition, the effect of sensor configuration on state observability and estimation accuracy is investigated while the unscented Kalman filter (UKF) is exploited in the estimation process. Performance and viability of the proposed temperature-based OE are verified through Monte Carlo simulations and a comprehensive sensitivity analysis over orbital parameters, satellite initial conditions, sensor accuracy and attitude error. © 2019 Elsevier Masson SAS",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85061432881&doi=10.1016%2fj.ast.2019.01.056&partnerID=40&md5=11b4017b4ee1fa787317f42f187089cc,Aerospace Science and Technology,2019
Resilience in Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS),"Many cities are adopting increasingly advanced Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS). These systems combine connectivity, coordination, adaptivity, and automated response for transportation policy optimization, thus increasing “smartness” and efficiency. However, the control and sensing systems of implemented ITS can open new vulnerabilities, especially to cyber-attacks. Currently vulnerability is managed within the framework of traditional risk assessment that assesses potential failures of the system in response to specified threats. Emerging technologies by their nature have threats that are not fully known, therefore, resilience, defined as the system's ability to recover and adapt to both known and unknown threats, is an emerging area that holds promise for assessing threats to ITS. To illustrate the applicability of resilience to ITS, we conducted a study of network efficiency and resilience in response to random and targeted disruptions of ITS systems in 10 urban areas. Disruptions were generated to affect either intersections or roadways controlled by ITS under different threat scenarios. Modeled attacks, under worst case scenarios, disrupted 20% of intersections causing on average 14.6% more additional delays than the same severity attacks on roadways. Additionally, locking traffic signal states was found to cause more disruption than fully disabling signals. Thus, as cities adopt ITS and other smart systems resulting in potentially unknown vulnerabilities, it is important to consider resilience of transportation infrastructure affected by potential cyber-attacks. © 2019",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85061045410&doi=10.1016%2fj.trc.2019.01.014&partnerID=40&md5=2bdc6d0b1714a4ee3d785498c64ecd20,Transportation Research Part C: Emerging Technologies,2019
Locating multiple GPS jammers using networked UAVs,"Recent technologies, such as, Internet of Things and cloud services, increases the usage of small and low-cost networked unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), which needs to be robust against malicious global positioning system (GPS) attacks. Due to the availability of low-cost GPS jammers in the commercial market, there has been a rising risk of multiple jammers and not just one. However, it is challenging to locate multiple jammers because the traditional jammer localization via multilateration is applicable for only a single jammer case. Also, during a jamming attack, the positioning capability of an on-board GPS receiver is compromised given its inability to track GPS signals. We propose a simultaneous localization of multiple jammers and receivers (SLMR) algorithm by analyzing the variation in the front-end signal power recorded by the GPS receivers on-board a network of UAVs. Our algorithm not only locates multiple jammers but also utilizes these malicious sources as additional navigation signals for positioning the UAVs. We design a Gaussian mixture probability hypothesis density filter over a graph framework, which is optimized using a Levenberg-Marquardt minimizer. Using a simulated experimental setup, we validate the convergence and localization accuracy of our SLMR algorithm for various cases, including attacks with a single jammer, multiple jammers, and a varying number of jammers. We also demonstrate that our SLMR algorithm is able to simultaneously locate multiple jammers and UAVs, even for a larger transmitted power of the jammers. © 2014 IEEE.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85065611269&doi=10.1109%2fJIOT.2019.2896262&partnerID=40&md5=004d0f8b9dda8cdd847428790e28e6c6,IEEE Internet of Things Journal,2019
An anonymous and efficient multiserver authenticated key agreement with offline registration centre,"Multiserver authentication (MSA) architecture permits its registered users to get the services of various service providers without performing separate registrations with each server. Since, a single registration from registration authority, a trusted third party, is sufficient to get mutually authenticated with service providers, onwards. In this paper, we have emphasized only on the MSA-based schemes that do not require online registration authority for mutual authentication. While, considering those MSA schemes, to date, there is no secure and efficient MSA protocol in our observation that is free of all four limitations at the same time, such as 1) free of the hassle of storage of server-based parameters in users' smart card by registration authority, 2) free of the transmission of user-based identities to all servers in a network, 3) free of a single secret key distribution to all servers as assumed in a trusted system, and 4) free from employing costly bilinear pairing operations. In view of those shortcomings, we present an anonymous MSA protocol that nearly counters all those problems using elliptic curve cryptography and escaping costly pairing operations. Our scheme also demonstrates the scheme's robustness using formal security analysis employing random oracle model and automated tool analysis. © 2018 IEEE",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85048883640&doi=10.1109%2fJSYST.2018.2838450&partnerID=40&md5=6a463bbcc27fa43e1b1bb0c920c8c878,IEEE Systems Journal,2019
Energy Efficient Legitimate Wireless Surveillance of UAV Communications,"Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) enhance connectivity and accessibility for civilian and military applications. Criminals or terrorists can potentially use UAVs for committing crimes and terrorism, thus endangering public safety. In this paper, we consider that a legitimate UAV is employed to track flight of suspicious UAVs for preventing safety and security threats. To obtain flight information of the suspicious UAVs, the legitimate UAV intentionally jams the suspicious receiver so as to force the suspicious UAV to reduce its data rate, and hence increase the eavesdropping success. An energy-efficient jamming strategy is proposed for the legitimate UAV to maximize the amount of eavesdropped packets. Moreover, a tracking algorithm is developed for the legitimate UAV to track the suspicious flight by comprehensively utilizing eavesdropped packets, angle-of-arrival and received signal strength of the suspicious transmitter's signal. A new simulation framework is implemented to combine the complementary features of optimization toolbox with channel modeling (in MATLAB) and discrete event-driven mobility tracking (in NS3). Moreover, numerical results validate the proposed algorithms in terms of packet eavesdropping rate and tracking accuracy of the suspicious UAVs' trajectory. © 1967-2012 IEEE.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85063265649&doi=10.1109%2fTVT.2019.2890999&partnerID=40&md5=baca9b0b4d13104969da855bfaa578fb,IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology,2019
Secure-anonymous user authentication scheme for e-healthcare application using wireless medical sensor networks,"Wireless medical sensor networks are becoming very popular in improving the quality of the healthcare systems. Since the data to be handled are very sensitive, the exchange of information over insecure wireless channels can cause serious exposures. The authentication schemes to be employed with sensor networks should be handled with care because of the limited resources and energy available with the sensor nodes. Therefore, this study aims at improving existing authentication schemes by providing protection for healthcare infrastructures against potential, well-known attacks while minimizing the overhead. An anonymous-based user authentication scheme is presented to improve the security features, computation, and communication overhead of the wireless sensor networks. The proposed scheme uses improved elliptic curve cryptography and is secure against password guessing attacks and smart card lost/stolen verifier attacks, and also preserves user anonymity. Through the formal and informal security analyses, it is shown that the proposed scheme is secure against possible known attacks, including the password guessing attacks and smart card lost/stolen verifier attacks, and that it also preserves the user anonymity property. In addition, for the formal security verification, the proposed scheme is simulated using the widely accepted automated validation of internet security protocols and applications (AVISPA) tool. The proposed scheme provides high security along with incurring low computational and communication costs. © 2017 IEEE",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85053602092&doi=10.1109%2fJSYST.2018.2866067&partnerID=40&md5=440c0ac15223cd7669bb24026669ce28,IEEE Systems Journal,2019
Toward Privacy-Preserving Valet Parking in Autonomous Driving Era,"Automated valet parking, deemed as a key milestone on the way to autonomous driving, has great potential to improve the 'last-mile' driving experience for users. On the other hand, it triggers serious risks on vehicle theft and location privacy leakage. To address these issues, we propose a secure and privacy-preserving automated valet parking protocol for self-driving vehicles. The proposed protocol is characterized by extending anonymous authentication to support two-factor authentication with mutual traceability for reducing the risks of vehicle theft and preventing the privacy leakage of users in automated valet parking. Specifically, based on one-time password and secure mobile devices, two-factor authentication is achieved between vehicles and smartphones to ensure vehicle security in remote pickup. By exploiting the BBS+ signature and the Cuckoo filter, user location privacy is protected against the curious parking lots and service providers. In addition, the traceable tags are designed to enable a trusted authority to identify the vehicles and users for localizing a stolen or missing vehicle and preventing the slandering of greedy users. Finally, formal security analysis on the proposed protocol is given to show that the authentication, anonymity, and traceability can be reduced to standard hard assumptions, and performance evaluation demonstrates the proposed protocol is efficient and practical to be implemented in autonomous driving era. © 1967-2012 IEEE.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85063278175&doi=10.1109%2fTVT.2019.2894720&partnerID=40&md5=3a8c98fbfedccd20cc96250d0c72c1e6,IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology,2019
The Foldable Drone: A Morphing Quadrotor That Can Squeeze and Fly,"The recent advances in state estimation, perception, and navigation algorithms have significantly contributed to the ubiquitous use of quadrotors for inspection, mapping, and aerial imaging. To further increase the versatility of quadrotors, recent works investigated the use of an adaptive morphology, which consists of modifying the shape of the vehicle during flight to suit a specific task or environment. However, these works either increase the complexity of the platform or decrease its controllability. In this letter, we propose a novel, simpler, yet effective morphing design for quadrotors consisting of a frame with four independently rotating arms that fold around the main frame. To guarantee stable flight at all times, we exploit an optimal control strategy that adapts on the fly to the drone morphology. We demonstrate the versatility of the proposed adaptive morphology in different tasks, such as negotiation of narrow gaps, close inspection of vertical surfaces, and object grasping and transportation. The experiments are performed on an actual, fully autonomous quadrotor relying solely on onboard visual-inertial sensors and compute. No external motion tracking systems and computers are used. This is the first work showing stable flight without requiring any symmetry of the morphology. © 2018 IEEE.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85063310071&doi=10.1109%2fLRA.2018.2885575&partnerID=40&md5=ecf5078508d9c7b7658d22d49a906ee7,IEEE Robotics and Automation Letters,2019
"Decision-Making Framework for Autonomous Driving at Road Intersections: Safeguarding Against Collision, Overly Conservative Behavior, and Violation Vehicles","In this paper, we propose a decision-making framework for autonomous driving at road intersections that determines appropriate maneuvers for an autonomous vehicle to navigate an intersection safely and efficiently (regarding making progress), even in the face of violation vehicles-one of the most challenging tasks in the domain of autonomous vehicles. The proposed framework uses a digital map to predict future paths of observed vehicles and then uses the predicted future paths to identify potential threats (vehicles) and collision areas, regardless of whether observed vehicles are obeying traffic rules at the intersection. Next, under an independent and distributed reasoning structure, it systematically, reliably, and robustly assesses the potential threats, even under incomplete and uncertain noise data, by way of a threat measure, Bayesian networks, and time window filtering. It then uses this information to determine appropriate maneuvers for the autonomous vehicle to navigate the intersection safely and efficiently. We have tested and evaluated the proposed framework through in-vehicle testing on a closed urban test road under traffic conditions inclusive of nonviolation and violation vehicles. In-vehicle testing results show the performance of the proposed framework to be sufficiently reliable for autonomous driving at intersections regarding reliability, robustness, safety, and efficiency. © 2012 IEEE.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85048024768&doi=10.1109%2fTIE.2018.2840530&partnerID=40&md5=924ee94656f76b4c67b580ab119b751e,IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics,2019
Design and analysis of secure lightweight remote user authentication and key agreement scheme in internet of drones deployment,"The Internet of Drones (IoD) provides a coordinated access to unmanned aerial vehicles that are referred as drones. The on-going miniaturization of sensors, actuators, and processors with ubiquitous wireless connectivity makes drones to be used in a wide range of applications ranging from military to civilian. Since most of the applications involved in the IoD are real-time based, the users are generally interested in accessing real-time information from drones belonging to a particular fly zone. This happens if we allow users to directly access real-time data from flying drones inside IoD environment and not from the server. This is a serious security breach which may deteriorate performance of any implemented solution in this IoD environment. To address this important issue in IoD, we propose a novel lightweight user authentication scheme in which a user in the IoD environment needs to access data directly from a drone provided that the user is authorized to access the data from that drone. The formal security verification using the broadly accepted automated validation of Internet security protocols and applications tool along with informal security analysis show that our scheme is secure against several known attacks. The performance comparison demonstrates that our scheme is efficient with respect to various parameters, and it provides better security as compared to those for the related existing schemes. Finally, the practical demonstration of our scheme is done using the widely accepted NS2 simulation. © 2014 IEEE.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85058878262&doi=10.1109%2fJIOT.2018.2888821&partnerID=40&md5=0e6b879aa25748778042eca2835aca21,IEEE Internet of Things Journal,2019
Throughput maximization for uav-enabled wireless powered communication networks,"This paper studies an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV)-enabled wireless powered communication network (WPCN), in which a UAV is dispatched as a mobile access point (AP) to serve a set of ground users periodically. The UAV employs the radio frequency (RF) wireless power transfer (WPT) to charge the users in the downlink, and the users use the harvested RF energy to send independent information to the UAV in the uplink. Unlike the conventional WPCN with fixed APs, the UAV-enabled WPCN can exploit the mobility of the UAV via trajectory design, jointly with the wireless resource allocation optimization, to maximize the system throughput. In particular, we aim to maximize the uplink common (minimum) throughput among all ground users over a finite UAV's flight period, subject to its maximum speed constraint and the users' energy neutrality constraints. The resulted problem is nonconvex and thus difficult to be solved optimally. To tackle this challenge, we first consider an ideal case without the UAV's maximum speed constraint, and obtain the optimal solution to the relaxed problem. The optimal solution shows that the UAV should successively hover above a finite number of ground locations for downlink WPT, as well as above each of the ground users for uplink communication. Next, we consider the general problem with the UAV's maximum speed constraint. Based on the above multilocation-hovering solution, we first propose an efficient successive hover-and-fly trajectory design, jointly with the downlink and uplink wireless resource allocation, and then propose a locally optimal solution by applying the techniques of alternating optimization and successive convex programming (SCP). Numerical results show that the proposed UAV-enabled WPCN achieves significant throughput gains over the conventional WPCN with fixed-location AP. © 2014 IEEE.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85054626646&doi=10.1109%2fJIOT.2018.2875446&partnerID=40&md5=b25ff2e3445c658b6f865b74109b7737,IEEE Internet of Things Journal,2019
Capacity and delay of unmanned aerial vehicle networks with mobility,"Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) are widely exploited in environment monitoring, search-and-rescue, etc. However, the mobility and short flight duration of UAVs bring challenges for UAV networking. In this paper, we study the UAV networks with n UAVs acting as aerial sensors. UAVs generally have short flight duration and need to frequently get energy replenishment from the control station. Hence, the returning UAVs bring the data of the UAVs along the returning paths to the control station with a store-carry-and-forward (SCF) mode. A critical range for the distance between the UAV and the control station is discovered. Within the critical range, the per-node capacity of the SCF mode is Θ (n/log n) times higher than that of the multihop mode. However, the per-node capacity of the SCF mode outside the critical range decreases with the distance between the UAV and the control station. To eliminate the critical range, a mobility control scheme is proposed such that the capacity scaling laws of the SCF mode are the same for all UAVs, which improves the capacity performance of UAV networks. Moreover, the delay of the SCF mode is derived. The impact of the size of the entire region, the velocity of UAVs, the number of UAVs and the flight duration of UAVs on the delay of SCF mode is analyzed. This paper reveals that the mobility and short flight duration of UAVs have beneficial effects on the performance of UAV networks, which may motivate the study of SCF schemes for UAV networks. © 2014 IEEE.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85053603122&doi=10.1109%2fJIOT.2018.2871024&partnerID=40&md5=ca471ea436d38df0106e93c4a7c5f747,IEEE Internet of Things Journal,2019
Learning to communicate in UAV-Aided wireless networks: Map-based approaches,"We consider a scenario where an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV)-mounted flying base station is providing data communication services to a number of radio nodes spread over the ground. We focus on the problem of resource-constrained UAV trajectory design with: 1) optimal channel parameters learning and 2) optimal data throughput as key objectives, respectively. While the problem of throughput optimized trajectories has been addressed in prior works, the formulation of an optimized trajectory to efficiently discover the propagation parameters has not yet been addressed. When it comes to the communication phase, the advantage of this paper comes from the exploitation of a 3-D city map. Unfortunately, the communication trajectory design based on the raw map data leads to an intractable optimization problem. To solve this issue, we introduce a map compression method that allows us to tackle the problem with standard optimization tools. The trajectory optimization is then combined with a node scheduling algorithm. The advantages of the learning-optimized trajectory and of the map compression method are illustrated in the context of intelligent Internet of Things data harvesting. © 2014 IEEE.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85056300739&doi=10.1109%2fJIOT.2018.2879682&partnerID=40&md5=9023e3f8e0e6afdc0df78f16f945364b,IEEE Internet of Things Journal,2019
Performance analysis and optimization of UAV integrated terrestrial cellular network,"Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) have been extensively applied as aerial access points to assist the terrestrial wireless network. Despite the inherent potential, nevertheless, it still remains to explore whether the gain of UAV access points (UAPs) could be fully harvested, which is critically dependent on the factors including the flight altitude and deployment density of UAPs. In this light, we investigate the performance of a downlink UAV integrated terrestrial cellular network (UTCN) and analytically study the influence of varying UAP altitude and density on the spatial throughput (ST) of UTCN. In particular, we obtain the UAP altitude upper bound, below which more line-of-sight (LOS) connections could be provided to improve network ST. Otherwise, cross-layer interference over the LOS paths becomes dominant, which results in significant degradation of network ST. More importantly, we reveal the limitation of the application of UAPs by showing that there exists a critical UAP density, beyond which network ST would encounter a rapid decrease. To fully exploit the potential of UAPs, we further tailor a probabilistic interference avoidance scheme and study the optimization of the UAP activated probability. Remarkably, network ST could be substantially improved using the optimized activated probability, i.e., network ST could increase with the growing UAP density and converge to a positive constant instead of zero in the dense UAP regime. Therefore, the results of this paper could provide insight on the deployment and optimization of UTCN. © 2014 IEEE.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85055863502&doi=10.1109%2fJIOT.2018.2878802&partnerID=40&md5=2464617c42a4005139f6eeef3ecd7b72,IEEE Internet of Things Journal,2019
Transceiver design and multihop D2D for UAV IoT coverage in disasters,"When natural disasters strike, the coverage for Internet of Things (IoT) may be severely destroyed, due to the damaged communications infrastructure. Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) can be exploited as flying base stations to provide emergency coverage for IoT, due to its mobility and flexibility. In this paper, we propose multiantenna transceiver design and multihop device-to-device (D2D) communication to guarantee the reliable transmission and extend the UAV coverage for IoT in disasters. First, multihop D2D links are established to extend the coverage of UAV emergency networks due to the constrained transmit power of the UAV. In particular, a shortest-path-routing algorithm is proposed to establish the D2D links rapidly with minimum nodes. The closed-form solutions for the number of hops and the outage probability are derived for the uplink and downlink. Second, the transceiver designs for the UAV uplink and downlink are studied to optimize the performance of UAV transmission. Due to the nonconvexity of the problem, they are first transformed into convex ones and then, low-complexity algorithms are proposed to solve them efficiently. Simulation results show the performance improvement in the throughput and outage probability by the proposed schemes for UAV wireless coverage of IoT in disasters. © 2014 IEEE.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85055711671&doi=10.1109%2fJIOT.2018.2877504&partnerID=40&md5=3c67df0420e4097e98bd5fac337fa549,IEEE Internet of Things Journal,2019
Active localization of gas leaks using fluid simulation,"                             Sensors are routinely mounted on robots to acquire various forms of measurements in spatiotemporal fields. Locating features within these fields and reconstruction (mapping) of the dense fields can be challenging in resource-constrained situations, such as when trying to locate the source of a gas leak from a small number of measurements. In such cases, a model of the underlying complex dynamics can be exploited to discover informative paths within the field. We use a fluid simulator as a model to guide inference for the location of a gas leak. We perform localization via minimization of the discrepancy between observed measurements and gas concentrations predicted by the simulator. Our method is able to account for dynamically varying parameters of wind flow (e.g., direction and strength) and its effects on the observed distribution of gas. We develop algorithms for offline inference as well as for online path discovery via active sensing. We demonstrate the efficiency, accuracy, and versatility of our algorithm using experiments with a physical robot conducted in outdoor environments. We deploy an unmanned air vehicle mounted with a CO                             2                              sensor to automatically seek out a gas cylinder emitting CO                             2                              via a nozzle. We evaluate the accuracy of our algorithm by measuring the error in the inferred location of the nozzle, based on which we show that our proposed approach is competitive with respect to state-of-the-art baselines.                          © 2016 IEEE.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85064409202&doi=10.1109%2fLRA.2019.2895820&partnerID=40&md5=ebae465a4f7b4e8c61ecbb4876dd85b0,IEEE Robotics and Automation Letters,2019
UAV-Enabled spatial data sampling in large-scale iot systems using denoising autoencoder neural network,"Internet of Things (IoT) technology has been pervasively applied to environmental monitoring, due to the advantages of low cost and flexible deployment of IoT enabled systems. In many large-scale IoT systems, accurate and efficient data sampling and reconstruction is among the most critical requirements, since this can relieve the data rate of trunk link for data uploading while ensure data accuracy. To address the related challenges, we have proposed an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) enabled spatial data sampling scheme in this paper using denoising autoencoder (DAE) neural network. More specifically, a UAV-enabled edge-cloud collaborative IoT system architecture is first developed for data processing in large-scale IoT monitoring systems, where UAV is utilized as mobile edge computing device. Based on this system architecture, the UAV-enabled spatial data sampling scheme is further proposed, where the wireless sensor nodes of large-scale IoT systems are clustered by a newly developed bounded-size K-means clustering algorithm. A neural network model, i.e., DAE, is applied to each cluster for data sampling and reconstruction, by exploitation of both linear and nonlinear spatial correlation among data samples. Simulations have been conducted and the results indicate that the proposed scheme has improved data reconstruction accuracy under the sampling ratio without introducing extra complexity, as compared to the compressive sensing-based method. © 2014 IEEE.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85055050513&doi=10.1109%2fJIOT.2018.2876695&partnerID=40&md5=c2fb8d5e8da4dfd75d341b88b53f0cd2,IEEE Internet of Things Journal,2019
AgriColMap: Aerial-Ground Collaborative 3D Mapping for Precision Farming,"The combination of aerial survey capabilities of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) with targeted intervention abilities of agricultural unmanned ground vehicles (UGVs) can significantly improve the effectiveness of robotic systems applied to precision agriculture. In this context, building and updating a common map of the field is an essential but challenging task. The maps built using robots of different types show differences in size, resolution, and scale, the associated geolocation data may be inaccurate and biased while the repetitiveness of both visual appearance and geometric structures found within agricultural contexts render classical map merging techniques ineffective. In this letter, we propose AgriColMap, a novel map registration pipeline that leverages a grid-based multimodal environment representation, which includes a vegetation index map and a digital surface model. We cast the data association problem between maps built from UAVs and UGVs as a multimodal, large displacement dense optical flow estimation. The dominant, coherent flows, selected using a voting scheme, are used as point-to-point correspondences to infer a preliminary nonrigid alignment between the maps. A final refinement is then performed, by exploiting only meaningful parts of the registered maps. We evaluate our system using real-world data for three fields with different crop species. The results show that our method outperforms several state-of-the-art map registration and matching techniques by a large margin, and has a higher tolerance to large initial misalignments. We release an implementation of the proposed approach along with the acquired datasets with this letter. © 2016 IEEE.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85063311431&doi=10.1109%2fLRA.2019.2894468&partnerID=40&md5=6342a1228fb8eba1f2b1f9c199673d41,IEEE Robotics and Automation Letters,2019
Pricing Data Tampering in Automated Fare Collection with NFC-Equipped Smartphones,"Automated Fare Collection (AFC) systems have been globally deployed for decades, particularly in the public transportation network where the transit fee is calculated based on the length of the trip (a.k.a., distance-based pricing AFC systems). Although most messages of AFC systems are insecurely transferred in plaintext, system operators did not pay much attention to this vulnerability, since the AFC network is basically isolated from the public network (e.g., the Internet) - there is no way of exploiting such a vulnerability from the outside of the AFC network. Nevertheless, in recent years, the advent of Near Field Communication (NFC)-equipped smartphones has opened up a channel to invade into the AFC network from the mobile Internet, i.e., by Host-based Card Emulation (HCE) over NFC-equipped smartphones. In this paper, we identify a novel paradigm of attacks, called LessPay, against modern distance-based pricing AFC systems, enabling users to pay much less than what they are supposed to be charged. The identified attack has two important properties: 1) it is invisible to AFC system operators because the attack never causes any inconsistency in the back-end database of the operators; and 2) it can be scalable to affect a large number of users (e.g., 10,000) by only requiring a moderate-sized AFC card pool (e.g., containing 150 cards). To evaluate the efficacy of the attack, we developed an HCE app to launch the LessPay attack; and the real-world experiments demonstrate not only the feasibility of the LessPay attack (with 97.6 percent success rate) but also its low cost in terms of bandwidth and computation. Finally, we propose, implement and evaluate four types of countermeasures, and present security analysis and comparison of these countermeasures on defending against the LessPay attack. © 2002-2012 IEEE.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85049485874&doi=10.1109%2fTMC.2018.2853114&partnerID=40&md5=ec94100af0770d920cdd18102b91b523,IEEE Transactions on Mobile Computing,2019
Making intersections safer with I2V communication,"Intersections are hazardous places. Threats arise from interactions among pedestrians, bicycles and vehicles, more complicated vehicle trajectories in the absence of lane markings, phases that prevent determining who has the right of way, invisible vehicle approaches, vehicle obstructions, and illegal movements. These challenges are not fully addressed by the “road diet” and road redesign prescribed in Vision Zero plans, nor will they be completely overcome by autonomous vehicles with their many sensors and tireless attention to surroundings. Accidents can also occur because drivers, cyclists and pedestrians do not have the information they need to avoid wrong decisions. In these cases, the missing information can be computed and broadcast by an intelligent intersection. The information gives the current full signal phase, an estimate of the time when the phase will change, and the occupancy of the blind spots of the driver or autonomous vehicle. The paper develops a design of the intelligent intersection, motivated by the analysis of an accident at an intersection in Tempe, AZ, between an automated Uber Volvo and a manual Honda CRV and culminates in a proposal for an intelligent intersection infrastructure. The intelligent intersection also serves as a software-enabled version of the ‘protected intersection’ design to improve the passage of cyclists and pedestrians through an intersection. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85063262692&doi=10.1016%2fj.trc.2019.02.017&partnerID=40&md5=02d3cb62c8201a86632b658b44367766,Transportation Research Part C: Emerging Technologies,2019
Optimal utility of vehicles in LTE-V Scenario: An immune clone-based spectrum allocation approach,"With the surge service requirements from vehicular users, especially for automated driving, providing real-time high-rate wireless connections to fast-moving vehicles is ever demanding. This motivates the development of the emerging LTE-V network, a 5G cellular-based vehicular technology. However, note that the vehicular user group is typically of a very large scale, whereas the bandwidth spectrum available for vehicular communications is very limited. To efficiently allocate and utilize the slim spectrum resource to vehicle users are therefore important. This paper develops a service priority oriented spectrum allocation scheme in an LTE-V network, which explores the features of vehicular networks toward economic yet QoS guaranteed spectrum allocation. Specifically, the work exploits two features of the vehicular networks. First, vehicles in the proximity typically have similar information requirements, e.g., road conditions. As a result, the location-based multicast (i.e., geocast) could be applied to save the spectrum. Second, different types of vehicles, e.g., ambulances, buses, and private cars, are of different bandwidth and service requirements. Therefore, differential services and spectrum allocations should be applied. By jointly considering the above features, we develop a 2-D service importance oriented framework for LTE-V network spectrum allocations. The spectrum allocation issue is finally modeled as a mixed integer programming problem to maximize the system utility, and solved using an immune clonal based algorithm. The convergence of the proposed algorithm is proved, and using numerical results, we show that our proposal can outperform the typical heuristics-based spectrum resource allocation in terms of convergence and average delay. © 2000-2011 IEEE.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85050641427&doi=10.1109%2fTITS.2018.2850311&partnerID=40&md5=7216e255aa15dedf9d51fd6128abe010,IEEE Transactions on Intelligent Transportation Systems,2019
Two-stage request scheduling for autonomous vehicle logistic system,"Autonomous vehicles are expected to play an important role in handling the last mile logistics in intelligent transportation systems thanks to their unmanned nature and full-fledged controllability. Recently, an autonomous vehicle logistic system (AVLS) was proposed, which employs autonomous vehicles to serve logistic requests and utilize the excessive renewable energy generated by distributed generations. In this paper, we propose an optimization problem for AVLS to develop schedules for request allocation, vehicle routing, and battery charging. By considering the unique characteristics of AVLS, the proposed scheduling problem can exploit its advantages in goods delivery and renewable energy utilization over existing logistic request allocation algorithms. We formulate the problem as a mixed integer non-linear program. To improve its scalability, we also devise a two-stage scheduling methodology to approach the optimal solutions of the original problem. We conduct comprehensive simulations to assess the performance of the proposed request scheduling problem and two-stage scheduling methodology. The results indicate that the proposed problem can improve the efficacy of AVLS in terms of total travel distance and utilized renewable energy, and the two-stage methodology can develop near-optimal solutions with notably reduced computation time. © 2000-2011 IEEE.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85049430952&doi=10.1109%2fTITS.2018.2849091&partnerID=40&md5=1a04018f3fdc7ac7b90f8e84ea990acc,IEEE Transactions on Intelligent Transportation Systems,2019
Study on dynamic characteristics analysis of underwater dynamic docking device,"Autonomous recovery technology utilized by autonomous underwater vehicles (AUV) is facing enormous challenges resulting from rapid development. In this paper, the current research status of static and dynamic AUV docking is first introduced. Then two styles of underwater dynamic docking devices, captured-style and guided-style, are designed in accordance with two commonly used underwater docking devices. The two types of docking devices, focusing on their respective constitution characteristics, and working principles are introduced. The analysis is conducted on kinematics and movement stability. The two docking devices' dynamic characteristics are analyzed using computational fluid dynamics (CFD) software known as Star-CCM. The simulation results of the dynamic characteristics of the two docking devices are then compared. Finally, a preliminary lake test for the stable wing is carried out. Through the analysis of the two underwater dynamic docking devices' dynamic characteristics, we obtain conclusions: 1) the docking's stability is related to the relative position of hydrodynamic center point; 2) the relationship between the hydrodynamic characteristics of these two underwater docking devices and the velocity and attack angle is not exactly the same; 3) the velocity is an important factor affecting underwater dynamic docking or recycling an AUV. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85063778822&doi=10.1016%2fj.oceaneng.2019.03.033&partnerID=40&md5=7870f73fc38ec1fd50f59ae3fc896eb6,Ocean Engineering,2019
Network Design for Accurate Vehicle Localization,"Network-based localization plays a key role on the introduction of emerging road applications, such as connected autonomous driving. These applications demand unprecedented precise, reliable and secure positioning, with localization requirements below 1 m. This stringent demand is pushing for the use of road-side units (RSUs) from fifth generation and vehicular networks for accurate vehicle localization. However, these networks are not typically designed for positioning but for data communication purposes, which follow a different paradigm for the network deployment and operation. This paper provides design guidelines on dedicated network deployments with the aim of achieving accurate vehicle-to-infrastructure positioning in road scenarios. First, the network layout or site placement is assessed with a geometrical metric. Then, the minimum density of RSUs along the road is bounded with line-of-sight probability models for urban street and highway scenarios. Finally, the Cramér-Rao bound for joint time-of-arrival (ToA) and angle-of-arrival (AoA) localization is used to maximize the distance between RSUs along the road, by exploiting multi-antenna deployments. According to the simulation results, the network sites are recommended to be located at alternate sides of the road, with a maximum distance between RSUs of 40 and 230 m for urban and rural environments, respectively. Following these design guidelines, there is also the need to exploit antenna arrays to combine uplink ToA and AoA estimates, in order to ensure a vehicle location accuracy below one meter on the 95% of the cases. The use of eight antenna elements at the RSUs is found to reduce nearly one and a half times the minimum network density in highway localization deployments. © 1967-2012 IEEE.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85066601564&doi=10.1109%2fTVT.2019.2906485&partnerID=40&md5=c567cfc36e3e1f00a772c35d4e632f4c,IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology,2019
Detecting Vehicle Anomaly in the Edge via Sensor Consistency and Frequency Characteristic,"Autonomous vehicles are expected to significantly enhance the human mobility. However, recently researchers have discovered and demonstrated some attacks on vehicles, which have caused a panic among the public. Furthermore, these attacks have demonstrated that the security issue is still one of the major challenges of vehicles. In this paper, we propose a novel edge computing based anomaly detection, coined edge computing based vehicle anomaly detection (EVAD), which exploits edge based sensor data fusion to identify the anomaly events. The time domain property, i.e., the correlation between different intra-vehicle sensors, and the frequency domain property of sensor data are utilized to judge whether an anomaly has occurred within the vehicle. Especially, to reduce the computation overhead and improve the performance, multiple sensors will be organized as ring architecture, which is a tradeoff of detection accuracy and complexity. In addition, the major components (e.g., anomaly detection module) of EVAD are embedded in edge computing devices, which make the anomaly detection be more efficient and privacy preserving. Meanwhile, a more appropriate model is generated on the cloud server, of which computation overhead maybe heavy for edge computing devices. This paper evaluates the performance of EVAD under different scenarios, and the experimental results demonstrate its feasibility and efficiency. The average true positive rate achieves 99.5% with 1% false positive rate. © 1967-2012 IEEE.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85067821870&doi=10.1109%2fTVT.2019.2907692&partnerID=40&md5=c65ef1c0a16f40eddb255e8af776573e,IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology,2019
Mobility-Aware Multipath Communication for Unmanned Aerial Surveillance Systems,"Wireless communication platforms of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), commonly known as drones, usually operate in dynamic conditions with highly fluctuating capacities and erratic wireless access to the network resources. Effective design for adequate, robust, and consistent communications from the drones to the control center (aka server) is thus necessary to facilitate the implementation of the UAV system. Multipath TCP has the potential to exploit heterogeneous wireless paths and achieve robust bandwidth by controlling the dynamics of the convoy of drones. In this paper, we make use of fluid approach for proposing a generic system architecture toward a control mechanism for coordinating the convoy of drones. Moreover, we model multipath TCP and study their applications for the control scenario of a convoy of drones with three different communication interfaces, representing the head, tail, and the middle of the convoy. The access is through a satellite and several WiFi access points (APs) communicating to the server with time-variant wireless channel, subject to the dynamic mobility and distance of APs from the convoy's head and tail. The traffic on different paths governed by the flow control based on the movement and position of the convoy enable us to investigate the performance and convergence of communication system dynamics. In particular, Lyapunov theory is adopted to derive the stability conditions of the dynamics over the mobility of the convoy. © 1967-2012 IEEE.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85067806059&doi=10.1109%2fTVT.2019.2912851&partnerID=40&md5=c74d77d888cd241f4d45de8af62c987b,IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology,2019
Study on intelligent collision avoidance and recovery path planning system for the waterjet-propelled unmanned surface vehicle,"To avoid collision accidents and achieve independent recovery in the cluttered marine environment, this work proposes an intelligent path planning system for a waterjet-propelled unmanned surface vehicle (USV). Unlike the existing works on USV navigation systems, our study focuses on the real-time, smoothness and seaworthiness properties of the path in practical clutter environments. A hybrid A* algorithm with motion primitive constraints is proposed to generate an initial reference path. According to different types of dynamic obstacles, the International Regulations for Preventing Collisions at Sea (COLREGs) rules are used, and a local threat map based on the Apollonius circle is constructed to avoid these obstacles. Together with the motion characteristics of the waterjet-propelled USV, the Reeds-Shepp curve is used to calculate the autonomous recovery path. The performance of the proposed intelligent navigation system is verified in a practical marine environment. The experimental results show that our hybrid A* algorithm outperforms the conventional A* algorithm, and it is easy for the waterjet-propelled USV to follow the final continuous curvature path. It was demonstrated that our method can effectively avoid various static and dynamic obstacles in real time and thus help achieve autonomous recovery. © 2019",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85065497249&doi=10.1016%2fj.oceaneng.2019.04.076&partnerID=40&md5=71fc7b496fd566182ab3b6e7bdd4438d,Ocean Engineering,2019
"Improving localization accuracy in connected vehicle networks using rao-blackwellized particle filters: Theory, simulations, and experiments","A crucial function for automated vehicle technologies is accurate localization. Lane-level accuracy is not readily available from low-cost global navigation satellite system (GNSS) receivers because of factors such as multipath error and atmospheric bias. Approaches such as differential GNSS can improve localization accuracy, but usually require investment in expensive base stations. Connected vehicle technologies provide an alternative approach in improving the localization accuracy. It will be shown in this paper that localization accuracy can be enhanced using crude GNSS measurements from a group of connected vehicles, by matching their locations to a digital map. A Rao-Blackwellized particle filter is used to jointly estimate the common biases of the pseudo-ranges and the vehicle positions. Multipath biases, which introduce receiver-specific (non-common) error, are mitigated by a multi-hypothesis detection-rejection approach. The temporal correlation of the estimations is exploited through the prediction-update process. The proposed approach is compared with existing methods using both simulations and experimental results. It was found that the proposed algorithm can eliminate the common biases and reduce the localization error to below 1 m under open sky conditions. © 2000-2011 IEEE.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85053293283&doi=10.1109%2fTITS.2018.2866232&partnerID=40&md5=0ea170db87f53b170a038f0291563fb6,IEEE Transactions on Intelligent Transportation Systems,2019
Design and load reduction performance analysis of mitigator of AUV during high speed water entry,"The Autonomous Underwater Vehicle (AUV)will suffer severe impact load during the water entry, and its shell structure will undergo elastoplastic deformation, even breakage or damage, which seriously threatens the safety and reliability of the AUV. Therefore, it is necessary to carry out research on the buffering technology of the impact load of the vehicle into the water to ensure that the AUV can enter the water safely and reliably. In this paper, a mitigator is designed to reduce the impact load of the AUV entering the water. Numerical simulations based on the explicit finite element method with an Arbitrary-Lagrangian Eulerian (ALE)solver are carried out to study the mitigation characteristic of the designed mitigator. The accuracy of the model was verified by the experimental results of the water-entry of the small sphere, and the mesh independence was verified to determine the mesh size. Then, the effects of initial conditions such as buffer length, buffer material density, entry velocity and entry angle on the cushioning effect of the buffer head cap were studied. When the vertical water entry velocity is 50 m/s, the impact load reduction ratio is 42.2%; while the water entry angle is 60° and the water entry velocity is 50 m/s, the axial load reduction ratio is 28.8%, and the normal load reduction ratio is 27.8%. These conclusions will be useful for the designing of the crashworthy structural and the analysis of underwater weapon impact. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85064820302&doi=10.1016%2fj.oceaneng.2019.03.062&partnerID=40&md5=c1b71fa3ac741173bdb1e5874e9d0434,Ocean Engineering,2019
Dynamics modeling and trajectory optimization for unmanned aerial-aquatic vehicle diving into the water,"Unmanned aerial-aquatic vehicle (UAAV) is a new type of aircraft that can navigate both in air and underwater. Considering that the diving motion of UAAV plays an important role in the performance of UAAV and is under exploration, the dynamics modeling and trajectory optimization problem are studied in this paper. The UAAV model used in this study is introduced firstly, and folded wings are adopted to reduce the drag in the diving process. Among the forces imposed on UAAV, fluid force is the most complicated and is calculated by the forces induced by ideal fluid and viscous fluid respectively. Based on the established dynamic model, the diving process is regarded as a free motion to avoid the instability during the control switch between air and water. Therefore, the trajectory of UAAV is determined by the initial states of diving process. To obtain the satisfactory trajectory under certain optimization index, an adaptive and global-best guided CS algorithm, named as improved cuckoo search (ICS) algorithm, is developed to strength the exploitation ability and search efficiency. Simulation results demonstrate that the established dynamical model of UAAV is rational and can reflect the characteristic of the diving motion. The proposed ICS algorithm performs better than the particle swarm optimization (PSO) algorithm and the standard CS algorithm both in optimizing the elapsed time of diving process and the terminal position error. © 2019 Elsevier Masson SAS",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85064088283&doi=10.1016%2fj.ast.2019.04.004&partnerID=40&md5=76c49e2ae56384cdb11c9b6e1ab9f8a1,Aerospace Science and Technology,2019
ISTRICT: An Interdependent Strategic Trust Mechanism for the Cloud-Enabled Internet of Controlled Things,"The cloud-enabled Internet of controlled things (IoCT) envisions a network of sensors, controllers, and actuators connected through a local cloud in order to intelligently control physical devices. Because cloud services are vulnerable to advanced persistent threats (APTs), each device in the IoCT must strategically decide whether to trust cloud services that may be compromised. In this paper, we present iSTRICT, an interdependent strategic trust mechanism for the cloud-enabled IoCT. iSTRICT is composed of three interdependent layers. In the cloud layer, iSTRICT uses FlipIt games to conceptualize APTs. In the communication layer, it captures the interaction between devices and the cloud using signaling games. In the physical layer, iSTRICT uses optimal control to quantify the utilities in the higher level games. Best response dynamics link the three layers in an overall ""game-of-games,"" for which the outcome is captured by a concept called Gestalt Nash equilibrium (GNE). We prove the existence of a GNE under a set of natural assumptions and develop an adaptive algorithm to iteratively compute the equilibrium. Finally, we apply iSTRICT to trust management for autonomous vehicles that rely on measurements from remote sources. We show that strategic trust in the communication layer achieves a worst-case probability of compromise for any attack and defense costs in the cyber layer. © 2018 IEEE.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85057412054&doi=10.1109%2fTIFS.2018.2883272&partnerID=40&md5=cd31bfeec98124bee731659e51fb3ab8,IEEE Transactions on Information Forensics and Security,2019
DCL-AIM: Decentralized coordination learning of autonomous intersection management for connected and automated vehicles,"Conventional intersection managements, such as signalized intersections, may not necessarily be the optimal strategies when it comes to connected and automated vehicles (CAVs) environment. Autonomous intersection management (AIM) is tailored for CAVs aiming at replacing the conventional traffic control strategies. In this work, using the communication and computation technologies of CAVs, the sequential movements of vehicles through intersections are modelled as multi-agent Markov decision processes (MAMDPs) in which vehicle agents cooperate to minimize intersection delay with collision-free constraints. To handle the huge dimension scale incurred by the nature of multi-agent decision making problems, the state space of CAVs are decomposed into independent part and coordinated part by exploiting the structural properties of the AIM problem, and a decentralized coordination multi-agent learning approach (DCL-AIM) is proposed to solve the problem efficiently by exploiting both global and localized agent coordination needs in AIM. The main feature of the proposed approach is to explicitly identify and dynamically adapt agent coordination needs during the learning process so that the curse of dimensionality and environment nonstationarity problems in multi-agent learning can be alleviated. The effectiveness of the proposed method is demonstrated under a variety of traffic conditions.

UVDAR System for Visual Relative Localization with Application to Leader-Follower Formations of Multirotor UAVs,"A novel onboard relative localization method, based on ultraviolet light, used for real-time control of a leader-follower formation of multirotor UAVs, is presented in this paper. A new smart sensor, UVDAR, is employed in an innovative way, which does not require communication and is extremely reliable in real-world conditions. This innovative sensing system exploits UV spectrum and provides relative position and yaw measurements independently of environment conditions such as changing illumination and the presence of undesirable light sources and their reflections. The proposed approach exploits this retrieved information to steer the follower to a given three-dimensional position and orientation relative to the leader, which may be considered as the main building block of any multi-UAV system operating with small mutual distances among team members. The proposed solution was verified in demanding outdoor conditions, validating the usage of UVDAR in real flight scenario, and paving the way for further usage of UVDAR for practical multi-UAV formation deployments. © 2016 IEEE.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85065616264&doi=10.1109%2fLRA.2019.2901683&partnerID=40&md5=a25bd15439e92fceaa189b7ac54e3d6d,IEEE Robotics and Automation Letters,2019
A General Safety Framework for Learning-Based Control in Uncertain Robotic Systems,"The proven efficacy of learning-based control schemes strongly motivates their application to robotic systems operating in the physical world. However, guaranteeing correct operation during the learning process is currently an unresolved issue, which is of vital importance in safety-critical systems. We propose a general safety framework based on Hamilton-Jacobi reachability methods that can work in conjunction with an arbitrary learning algorithm. The method exploits approximate knowledge of the system dynamics to guarantee constraint satisfaction while minimally interfering with the learning process. We further introduce a Bayesian mechanism that refines the safety analysis as the system acquires new evidence, reducing initial conservativeness when appropriate while strengthening guarantees through real-Time validation. The result is a least-restrictive, safety-preserving control law that intervenes only when the computed safety guarantees require it, or confidence in the computed guarantees decays in light of new observations. We prove theoretical safety guarantees combining probabilistic and worst-case analysis and demonstrate the proposed framework experimentally on a quadrotor vehicle. Even though safety analysis is based on a simple point-mass model, the quadrotor successfully arrives at a suitable controller by policy-gradient reinforcement learning without ever crashing, and safely retracts away from a strong external disturbance introduced during flight. © 1963-2012 IEEE.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85055051764&doi=10.1109%2fTAC.2018.2876389&partnerID=40&md5=5311dba3556349a85f0a8109adf57aed,IEEE Transactions on Automatic Control,2019
TCALAS: Temporal credential-based anonymous lightweight authentication scheme for internet of drones environment,"A user (external party) is interested in accessing the real-time data from some designated drones of a particular fly zone in the Internet of Drones (IoD) deployment. However, to provide this facility, the user needs to be authenticated by an accessed remote drone and vice-versa. After successful authentication both parties can establish a secret session key for the secure communication. To handle this important problem in IoD environment, we design a novel temporal credential based anonymous lightweight user authentication mechanism for IoD environment, called TCALAS. A detailed security analysis using formal security under the broadly applied real-or-random (ROR) model, formal security verification under the broadly used software verification tool, known as automated validation of internet security protocols and applications, and also informal security analysis reveal that TCALAS has the capability to resist various known attacks against passive/active adversary. In addition, a detailed comparative study has been conducted for TCALAS and other related schemes, and the study also reveals that TCALAS provides better security and functionality features, and lower costs in both computation and communication as compared to existing schemes. © 2019 IEEE.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85068376865&doi=10.1109%2fTVT.2019.2911672&partnerID=40&md5=9c8b11abd07cf67ddb4b84e666b2ee39,IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology,2019
UKF-Based Navigation System for AUVs: Online Experimental Validation,"Modern autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs) are currently involved in complex tasks and scenarios, and require accurate and robust navigation systems to estimate their position. However, since the Global Positioning System cannot be exploited underwater, the AUV position is not directly measurable in real time (unless using dedicated acoustic-based sensors), making the availability of a reliable navigation system even more crucial. In this context, the main role is played by the filter used to estimate the AUV motion, usually relying on simple kinematic vehicle models and equations linearization. A navigation strategy specifically thought for AUVs and based on an unscented Kalman filter is proposed and experimentally validated by the authors. Preliminary tests of the developed strategy have been carried out by running the navigation filter on experimental data acquired during the FP7 European ARROWS project. This initial validation has been performed totally offline. The AUVs navigated in dead reckoning without using navigation filters, whereas the proposed strategy has been compared to standard extended Kalman filter based ones, highlighting encouraging performances. To further validate the proposed navigation system, suitable sea tests have been performed. The navigation filter has been implemented online on an AUV and the vehicle controller relied only on it to navigate. The new validation procedure, whose results are reported in this paper, showed again the good performance of the chosen strategy, yielding satisfying results in terms of accuracy of vehicle position estimation. © 1976-2012 IEEE.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85049128564&doi=10.1109%2fJOE.2018.2843654&partnerID=40&md5=5f0b50d65d574fe8271d9f29f06a1452,IEEE Journal of Oceanic Engineering,2019
Robust Sequential Trajectory Planning under Disturbances and Adversarial Intruder,"Provably safe and scalable multivehicle trajectory planning is an important and urgent problem. Although this problem has been studied in the past, there has not been a method that guarantees both goal satisfaction and safety for vehicles with general nonlinear dynamics, while taking into account disturbances and potential adversarial agents, to the best of our knowledge. Hamilton-Jacobi (HJ) reachability is the ideal tool for guaranteeing goal satisfaction and safety under such scenarios, which has been successfully applied to many small-scale problems; however, its direct application in most cases becomes intractable when there are more than two vehicles due to the exponentially scaling computational complexity with respect to system dimension. In this paper, we take advantage of the guarantees provided by HJ reachability and eliminate the computation burden by assigning a strict priority ordering to vehicles under consideration. Under this sequential trajectory planning (STP) scheme, vehicles reserve 'space-time' portions in the airspace. The space-time portions guarantee dynamic feasibility, collision avoidance, and optimality of trajectories given the priority ordering. With a computation complexity that scales quadratically when accounting for both disturbances and an intruder, and linearly when accounting for only disturbances, the STP can tractably solve the multivehicle trajectory planning problem for vehicles with general nonlinear dynamics in a practical setting. We demonstrate our theory in representative simulations. © 1993-2012 IEEE.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85046749410&doi=10.1109%2fTCST.2018.2828380&partnerID=40&md5=3ede77ad892dd3bc8d1c091a3c557abc,IEEE Transactions on Control Systems Technology,2019
Covert spoofing algorithm of UAV based on GPS/INS-integrated navigation,"A covert spoofing algorithm of an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) based on GPS/inertial-navigation-system-integrated navigation is analyzed in this paper. The proposed algorithm theoretically proves the fact that when the acceleration component of the counterfeit GPS signal is the difference between the UAV's current acceleration and the spoofing control input, the UAV can be covert spoofed. To avoid adverse consequences (detection or crash) caused by frequent changes in UAV flight during the GPS spoofing attacks, the proposed algorithm requires that the deception trajectory planned by the GPS spoofer is slowly changing relative to the reference trajectory, which is pre-set by the UAV. Simulation results have verified the correctness of the proposed covert spoofing algorithm of UAV. Moreover, the spoofing effect is more distinct when the deception trajectory planning is considered. © 2019 IEEE.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85069776961&doi=10.1109%2fTVT.2019.2914477&partnerID=40&md5=737c4163f99ee0008818c27517f3697f,IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology,2019
Generalized wireless-powered communications: When to activatewireless power transfer?,"Wireless-powered communication network (WPCN) is a key technology to power energy limited massive devices, such as on-board wireless sensors in autonomous vehicles, for Internet-of-Things applications. Conventional WPCNs rely only on dedicated downlink wireless power transfer (WPT), which is practically inefficient due to the significant energy loss in wireless signal propagation. Meanwhile, ambient energy harvesting is highly appealing as devices can scavenge energy from various existing energy sources (e.g., solar energy and cellular signals). Unfortunately, the randomness of the availability of these energy sources cannot guarantee stable communication services.Motivated by the above statements, we consider a generalized WPCN where the devices can not only harvest energy from a dedicated multiple-Antenna power station (PS), but can also exploit stored energy stemming from ambient energy harvesting. Since the dedicated WPT consumes system resources, if the stored energy is sufficient, WPTmay not be needed to maximize theweighted sum rate. To analytically characterize this phenomenon, we derive the condition forWPT activation and reveal how it is affected by the different system parameters. Subsequently, we further derive the optimal resource allocation policy for the cases thatWPT is activated and deactivated, respectively. In particular, it is found that whenWPT is activated, the optimal energy beamforming at the PS does not depend on the devices stored energy, which is shown to lead to a new unfairness issue. Simulation results verify our theoretical findings and demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed optimal resource allocation. © 2021 Georg Thieme Verlag.

EKF-Based Visual Inertial Navigation Using Sliding Window Nonlinear Optimization,"In this paper, we present a hybrid visual inertial navigation algorithm for an autonomous and intelligent vehicle that combines the multi-state constraint Kalman filter (MSCKF) with the nonlinear visual-inertial graph optimization. The MSCKF is a well-known visual inertial odometry (VIO) method that performs the fusion between an inertial measurement unit (IMU) and the image measurements within a sliding window. The MSCKF computes the re-projection errors from the camera measurements and the states in the sliding window. During this process, the structure-only estimation is performed without exploiting the full information over the window, like the relative interstate motion constraints and their uncertainties. The key contribution of this paper is combination of the filtering and non-linear optimization method for VIO, and the design of a novel measurement model that exploits all of the measurements and information available within the sliding window. The local visual-inertial optimization is performed using pre-integrated IMU measurements and camera measurements. It infers the probabilistically optimal relative pose constraints. These local optimal constraints are used to estimate the global states under the MSCKF framework. The proposed local-optimal-multi-state constraint Kalman filter is validated using a simulation data set, as well as publicly available real-world data sets generated from real-world urban driving experiments. © 2000-2011 IEEE.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85053353927&doi=10.1109%2fTITS.2018.2866637&partnerID=40&md5=dc241b8b80e95d1d93ebd7935508fe9b,IEEE Transactions on Intelligent Transportation Systems,2019
Context-Driven Autonomy for Enhanced System Resilience in Emergent Operating Environments,"As higher degrees of operational autonomy are sought in engineered systems, resilient command and control (C2) capabilities are essential for mitigating performance degradation and disruptions. Autonomous C2 systems typically excel in performance optimization and failure-prevention within known or anticipated environments, but can exhibit poor efficacy given a lack of preemptive knowledge of needs and environments. This paper presents a context-driven decision engine for resilient C2 of engineered systems in emergent operating environments. The solution integrates diagnostic and prognostic heuristics to 1) assess system state of health (SoH) based on operational availability; 2) establish situational awareness; and 3) drive C2 decisions based on scenario-specific constraints and priorities. The solution is applied to an air traffic management problem for autonomous aircraft operations based on a Federal Aviation Administration Next Generation Air Transportation System (NextGen) concept. Agent-based modeling and Monte Carlo simulation are used to evaluate the incident rate (λ) and mission reliability (RM) of the proposed context-based solution against rule-based and utility-based C2 solutions, including the Radio Technical Commission for Aeronautics DO-185B standard and Dynamic A-star Lite (D∗ Lite) algorithm. Paired t-tests are used to compare approaches based on λ and RM given identical test cases. Results suggest that the proposed context-based solution can concurrently enhance threat avoidance and adaptation capabilities in emergent environments, whereas unilaterally optimized performance is observed via the rule-based and utility-based C2 solutions. © 2019 IEEE.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85058088483&doi=10.1109%2fJSYST.2018.2881111&partnerID=40&md5=98e29cf5ce76048f2753e0ca64f68616,IEEE Systems Journal,2019
A novel self-adapting filter based navigation algorithm for autonomous underwater vehicles,"This paper presents a novel approach to the design of globally asymptotically stable position and assessment of an USBL-aided integrated navigation based on Condition-adaptive gain Extended Kalman Filter (CAEKF) for the deep water Autonomous Underwater Vehicles (AUVs) subject to uncertainties (e.g., loss of USBL signal, irregular and gross positioning error). Due to the influence of underwater observation conditions, positioning gross error will often appear when exploiting USBL to assist AUV navigation in ocean exploration. Aiming at this kind of problem a method of adding the conditional constraints and confidence assessment to EKF was put forward to filter the positioning value of USBL, and which can make the filtering result more robust and smooth. In addition, in order to reduce positioning error for the deep water vehicle online, an integrated navigation system is constructed by adding the acoustic navigation. Finally, the long voyage of the sea-trials data acquired in suitable sea trials performed in the South China Sea verifying the robustness and practicability of the proposed methodology, a very effective trade-off between accuracy and computational load has been achieved, and which demonstrated that the proposed algorithm outperforms standard navigation algorithms and other classical filtering approaches. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85068743817&doi=10.1016%2fj.oceaneng.2019.106146&partnerID=40&md5=ab67f466f94f6b3b417db18b2ab82ebe,Ocean Engineering,2019
Secure deep neural networks using adversarial image generation and training with Noise-GAN,"Recent advances in artificial intelligence have increased the importance of security issues. Nowadays, deep neural networks (DNNs) are used in many critical applications such as pilot drones and self-driving cars. So, the DNN's malfunction, due to an attack, may cause irreparable damages. The attack may happen either in training phase (poisoning attacks) or testing phase (evasion attacks) by presenting adversarial examples. These samples are maliciously created to deceive DNNs. This paper deals with evasion attacks and aims to immunize DNNs through adversarial examples generation and training. We propose Noise-GAN, a Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) with a multi-class Discriminator for producing a noise that by adding it to the original image adversarial examples can be obtained. In this paper, various types of evasion attacks are considered and performance of the proposed method is evaluated on different victim models under various defensive strategies. Experimental results are based on MNIST and CIFAR10 datasets and the average success rates for different attacks are reported and compared with state-of-the-art methods. The Non-targeted attack success rates on DNNs after training by adversarial examples, generated by Noise-GAN, were declined from 87.7% to 10.41% using MNIST dataset and from 91.2% to 57.66% using CIFAR-10 dataset. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85068841183&doi=10.1016%2fj.cose.2019.06.012&partnerID=40&md5=aa0c10b7bdcf89f73d7d3bd6d7ed46e3,Computers and Security,2019
Effect of disk angle-of-attack on aerodynamic performance of small propellers,"The aerodynamic performance of four 12-inch diameter propellers was investigated at propeller disk angles-of-attack ranging from 0° to 90° and at advance ratios ranging from 0 to 0.55. Aerodynamic load measurements using a six-axis load cell showed that the thrust of all four propellers increased with an increasing disk angle-of-attack, for all the advance ratios investigated. On the other hand, power consumption demonstrated lower sensitivity to variations in the propeller angle-of-attack. The load difference between the advancing and retreating blades caused pitch and yaw moments, which increased with an increasing propeller angle-of-attack. When plotted as a function of the inflow advance ratio, the thrust, power and propulsive efficiency plots overlapped for the range of disk angle-of-attacks. Analytical prediction of the performance of the rotor was carried out using blade element theory. Comparisons of the experimental data acquired and the predictions using different inflow models was made. The evaluation showed that the Glauert [15] and Coleman et al. [16] inflow models are capable of predicting propeller performance at a wide range of non-zero disk angle-of-attack with maximum discrepancy of 15%. © 2019 Elsevier Masson SAS",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85069499948&doi=10.1016%2fj.ast.2019.07.022&partnerID=40&md5=715fd11a45c37fc13e1dc23049df5eeb,Aerospace Science and Technology,2019
Morphing control of a new bionic morphing UAV with deep reinforcement learning,"With rapid development of aviation technology, materials science and artificial intelligence, aircraft design is pursuing higher requirements both in civil and military fields. The new generation of aircraft should have the autonomous capable of performing a variety of tasks (such as take-off and landing, cruising, maneuvering, hover, attack, etc.) under a highly variable flight environment (height, Mach number, etc.) and meanwhile maintaining good performance. Morphing aircraft can use smart materials and actuators to autonomously deform the shape according to the changes in flight environment and mission, and always maintain an optimal aerodynamic shape, therefore get flourished developments. Based on the ability of birds to stretch wings when flying at low speed and to constrict wings at high speed, a new bionic morphing UAV has been designed and developed as the study model by our team. In order to make this new aircraft be able to complete rapid autonomous morphing and aerodynamic performance optimization under different missions and flight conditions, we developed deep neural networks and reinforcement learning techniques as a control strategy. Considering the continuity of the state and action spaces for model, the Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient (DDPG) algorithm based on the actor-critic, model-free algorithm was adopted and verified on the classic nonlinear Pendulum model and Cart Pole game. After the feasibility was verified, morphing aircraft model was controlled to complete prescribed deformation using DDPG algorithm. Furthermore, on the condition that the DDPG algorithm can control morphing well, through training and testing on model using simulation data from wind tunnel tests and actual flight, the autonomous morphing control for the shape optimization of the bionic morphing UAV model could be realized. © 2019 Elsevier Masson SAS",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85067028833&doi=10.1016%2fj.ast.2019.05.058&partnerID=40&md5=2b779fffad455414b6ebb82112f3b84e,Aerospace Science and Technology,2019
Autonomous Driving Vehicles with Unmatched Disturbance Compensation using Deep Neural Networks,"In this paper, we propose an algorithm compensating for an unmatched disturbance which is difficult to thoroughly remove. In order to compensate for the disturbance of an autonomous driving vehicle, we exploit Deep Neural Network(DNN). It is well-known that we cannot compute the control command that completely compensates for any unmatched disturbance. In vehicle lateral dynamics using a lane keeping system with a look-ahead distance, there always exists the disturbance caused by a curvature of road. Thus, it is inevitable that the lane keeping system only with a feedback control has steady-state error in the lane center on a curved road. To resolve this problem, we utilize the feedback control system with DNN. The proposed method is unique in compensating for the unmatched disturbance in lane keeping system. From a simulation study, we observed that the proposed method could reduce lateral tracking error up to a half on a curved road. © 2019 Institute of Control, Robotics and Systems - ICROS.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85079092883&doi=10.23919%2fICCAS47443.2019.8971631&partnerID=40&md5=1739b8231a588694f4d6f5578f256cbc,"International Conference on Control, Automation and Systems",2019
Localization and Clustering Based on Swarm Intelligence in UAV Networks for Emergency Communications,"In recent years, unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) networks have been a focus area of the academic and industrial research community. They have been used in many military and civilian applications. Emergency communication is one of the essential requirements for first responders and victims in the aftermath of natural disasters. In such scenarios, UAVs may configure ad hoc wireless networks to cover a large area. In UAV networks, however, localization and routing are challenging tasks owing to the high mobility, unstable links, dynamic topology, and limited energy of UAVs. Here, we propose swarm-intelligence-based localization (SIL) and clustering schemes in UAV networks for emergency communications. First, we propose a new 3-D SIL algorithm based on particle swarm optimization (PSO) that exploits the particle search space in a limited boundary by using the bounding box method. In the 3-D search space, anchor UAV nodes are randomly distributed and the SIL algorithm measures the distance to existing anchor nodes for estimating the location of the target UAV nodes. Convergence time and localization accuracy are improved with lower computational cost. Second, we propose an energy-efficient swarm-intelligence-based clustering (SIC) algorithm based on PSO, in which the particle fitness function is exploited for intercluster distance, intracluster distance, residual energy, and geographic location. For energy-efficient clustering, cluster heads are selected based on improved particle optimization. The proposed SIC outperforms five typical routing protocols regarding packet delivery ratio, average end-to-end delay, and routing overhead. Moreover, SIC consumes less energy and prolongs network lifetime. © 2014 IEEE.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85073460977&doi=10.1109%2fJIOT.2019.2925567&partnerID=40&md5=b7825b78ba3b4399ca3c89b51b9186cb,IEEE Internet of Things Journal,2019
Online speed optimization with feedforward of unmanned sailboat via extremum seeking without steady-state oscillation,"Concentrated on the problem of steady-state oscillation of the traditional extremum seeking algorithm (ESA) that it is not beneficial to the speed optimization of unmanned sailboat, a novel speed optimization scheme with feedforward of unmanned sailboat via extremum seeking without steady-state oscillation (ESWSO) is proposed. This scheme consists of feedforward and feedback control: the feedforward part firstly presets the initial sail angle of attack according to an approximate piecewise constant function of the sailing speed polar diagram, its main function is avoid the large deviation of the longitudinal speed from the optimal value. Subsequently, the feedback part fine-tunes the speed to reach the optimal value through the extremum seeking (ES) control. In the process of continuously optimizing longitudinal speed, a functional relationship between the excitation signal amplitude and the extremum estimation error is constructed to eliminate the steady-state oscillation. Besides, the rigorous stability Proof of the scheme is given. Finally, taking a 12-m class unmanned sailboat as the simulation object, the results show that the optimization scheme can effectively eliminate steady-state oscillation and enable the sailing speed to reach the ideal optimal value, as well as has a high control accuracy and strong robustness. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85071865138&doi=10.1016%2fj.oceaneng.2019.106393&partnerID=40&md5=c3d3e548e31d01d1aef436a441e6c23e,Ocean Engineering,2019
AKM-IoV: Authenticated Key Management Protocol in Fog Computing-Based Internet of Vehicles Deployment,"Internet of Vehicles (IoV) is an intelligent application of Internet of Things (IoT) in smart transportation that takes intelligent commitments to the passengers to improve traffic safety and efficiency, and generate a more enjoyable driving and riding environment. Fog cloud-based IoV is another variant of mobile cloud computing where vehicular cloud and Internet can co-operate in more effective way in IoV. However, more increasing dependence on wireless communication, control, and computing technology makes IoV more dangerous to prospective attacks. For secure communication among vehicles, road-side units, fog and cloud servers, we design a secure authenticated key management protocol in fog computing-based IoV deployment, called AKM-IoV. In the designed AKM-IoV, after mutual authentication between communicating entities in IoV they establish session keys for secure communications. AKM-IoV is tested for its security analysis using the formal security analysis under the widely accepted real-or-random (ROR) model, informal, and formal security verification using the broadly accepted automated validation of Internet security protocols and applications (AVISPAs) tool. The practical demonstration of AKM-IoV is shown using the NS2 simulation. In addition, a detailed comparative study is conducted to show the efficiency and functionality and security features supported by AKM-IoV as compared to other existing recent protocols. © 2014 IEEE.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85073472902&doi=10.1109%2fJIOT.2019.2923611&partnerID=40&md5=f1b3157e0aac3ace2a0c7fa5416af135,IEEE Internet of Things Journal,2019
Multivariable adaptive control based consensus flight control system for UAVs formation,"Formation flight contributes to improving the attack, reconnaissance and survival ability of the multiple unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs). This paper studies a multivariable adaptive control based consensus flight method for UAVs formation. A majority of existing research is focused on the leader-following consensus problem assuming that only the parameters of followers are uncertain. However, they do not consider the leader dynamic uncertainty and the unknown external disturbances. Therefore, this paper addresses the problem of the UAVs consensus flight control with parametric uncertainties and unknown external disturbances for both the leader and follower. A multivariable model reference adaptive control (MRAC) based consensus flight control scheme is designed for UAVs formation, which enables the follower UAV to track the leader UAV. The stability of the multivariable MRAC based consensus flight control system is analyzed. Simulation results show that the proposed adaptive consensus flight control scheme has stronger robustness and adaptivity than the fixed control scheme. © 2019 Elsevier Masson SAS",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85071276427&doi=10.1016%2fj.ast.2019.105336&partnerID=40&md5=e4cfea2afe9bf45164cff7022d38203d,Aerospace Science and Technology,2019

Aircraft landing using dynamic two-dimensional image-based guidance control,"This paper proposes a two-dimensional (2-D) image-based controller to automatically steer a fixed-wing unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) during the first three stages of landing: alignment, glide-slope, and flare. Observable image features of the runway and its textured ground are exploited to derive a feedback controller for the automatic maneuver.

Novel control approaches for demand response with real-time pricing using parallel and distributed consensus-based ADMM,"This paper studies the automated demand response (DR) problem in smart grids equipped with information and communication technology networks, where power generating and consuming units can exchange information as a multiagent system (MAS), and a real-time pricing (RTP) scheme is proposed. When the communication graph among agents is connected, a novel parallel and distributed consensus-based algorithm is proposed to derive an RTP scheme to facilitate DR, and when communication uncertainties exist, a robust consensus algorithm is proposed to cease the effect of uncertainties. Next, this paper proposes a novel control mechanism to tackle the problem of disconnected communication among agents, e.g., under cyber-attacks, by employing the so-called mixed communication-broadcast control architecture where the underlying ideas are twofold. First, each area in the grid associated with a connected subgraph is controlled by a MAS to guarantee the power balance and to reach consensus on the local electric price for that area. Second, a supervisory unit observes those local electric prices to calculate the global electric price for the whole grid and then broadcasts to all units so that they can properly adjust their output powers. Simulations are carried out on the IEEE 39-bus system to validate the proposed control mechanisms. © 1982-2012 IEEE.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85057880796&doi=10.1109%2fTIE.2018.2881938&partnerID=40&md5=41ddd3036875bc8ab5f4fdc1d15cf439,IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics,2019
Cognitive Risk Control for Anti-Jamming V2V Communications in Autonomous Vehicle Networks,"The future of intelligent transportation system (ITS) is expected to be composed of connected and autonomous vehicles (CAVs), the development of which will have great impact on people's everyday life. Unfortunately, this progress will be accompanied by all kinds of potential threats and attacks rising in CAV network. As a legacy from traditional wireless networks, jamming attack is still one of the major and serious threats to vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) communications. In this paper, we investigate the anti-jamming V2V communication in CAV networks through power control in conjunction with channel selection. Bringing into play a brain-inspired research tool called cognitive dynamic system (CDS), the general structure of cognitive risk control (CRC) is well-tailored to analyze and address the jamming problem. Specifically, power control is carried out first using reinforcement learning, the result of which is then examined by a module called task-switch control. Based on the risk assessment, a multi-armed bandit (MAB) problem is formulated to perform the channel-selection process when necessary. Through continuous perception-action cycles (PACs), the feature of predictive adaptation is realized for the legitimate vehicle in its behavioral interactions with the jammer. Simulation results have shown that the proposed method has desirable performance in terms of several evaluation metrics. © 1967-2012 IEEE.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85073876579&doi=10.1109%2fTVT.2019.2935999&partnerID=40&md5=fbf759c98d30c0d36d115b202055cbe8,IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology,2019
A Novel Alternative Optimization Method for Joint Power and Trajectory Design in UAV-Enabled Wireless Network,"This correspondence aims to maximize the average throughput via the joint design of the transmit power and trajectory for unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV)-enabled network. The conventional way to tackle this problem is based on the alternating optimization (AO) method by iteratively updating power and trajectory until convergence, resulting in a non-convex trajectory subproblem which is difficult to deal with. To develop more efficient methods, we propose a novel AO method by incorporating both power and trajectory into an intermediate variable, and then iteratively updating power and the newly introduced variable. This novel variable transformation makes it easier to decompose the original problem into two convex subproblems, namely a throughput maximization subproblem and a feasibility subproblem. Consequently, both of these subproblems can be solved in a globally optimal fashion. We further propose a low-complexity algorithm for the feasibility subproblem by exploiting the alternating directional method of multipliers (ADMM), whose updating step is performed in closed-form solutions. Simulation results demonstrate that our proposed method reduces the computation time by orders of magnitude, while achieving higher performance than the conventional methods. © 1967-2012 IEEE.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85077742335&doi=10.1109%2fTVT.2019.2940549&partnerID=40&md5=c45bf12b01de70ae985bd78088e22949,IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology,2019
Secrecy Performance Analysis of Wireless Communications in the Presence of UAV Jammer and Randomly Located UAV Eavesdroppers,"Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) have been undergoing fast development for providing broader signal coverage and more extensive surveillance capabilities in military and civilian applications. Due to the broadcast nature of the wireless signal and the openness of the space, UAV eavesdroppers (UEDs) pose a potential threat to ground communications. In this paper, we consider the communications of a legitimate ground link in the presence of friendly jamming and UEDs within a finite area of space. The spatial distribution of the UEDs obeying a uniform binomial point process (BPP) is used to characterize the randomness of the UEDs. The ground link is assumed to experience log-distance path loss and Rayleigh fading, while free space path loss with/without the averaged excess path loss due to the environment is used for the air-to-ground/air-to-air links. A piecewise function is proposed to approximate the line-of-sight (LoS) probability for the air-to-ground links, which provides a better approximation than using the existing sigmoid-based fitting. The analytical expression for the secure connection probability (SCP) of the legitimate ground link in the presence of non-colluding UEDs is derived. The analysis reveals some useful trends in the SCP as a function of the transmit signal to jamming power ratio, the locations of the UAV jammer, and the height of UAVs. © 2019 IEEE.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85064635890&doi=10.1109%2fTIFS.2019.2912074&partnerID=40&md5=7b1f225df56a9a34017aad98034799fa,IEEE Transactions on Information Forensics and Security,2019
Blockchain-Based Mutual-Healing Group Key Distribution Scheme in Unmanned Aerial Vehicles Ad-Hoc Network,"A dynamic group key is required for secure communication in the Unmanned Aerial Vehicles Ad-Hoc Network (UAANET). However, due to the unreliable wireless channel and high-dynamic topology of UAANET, the situation that a node is missing certain group key broadcast messages occurs frequently. Existing group key distribution schemes cannot be directly applied to the UAANET, because of their poor security or real-time. Therefore, we present a mutual-healing group key distribution scheme based on the blockchain. Firstly, the Ground Control Station (GCS) builds a private blockchain where the group keys distributed by GCS are recorded. Meanwhile, through the blockchain, a dynamic list of UAANET membership certificates is also managed. According to different attack models, a basic mutual-healing protocol and an enhanced one are designed based on the Longest-Lost-Chain mechanism to recover the node's lost group keys with the aid of its neighbors. Security analysis and extensive experiments show that, compared with the existing mutual-healing schemes, our proposed solution can effectively resist various attacks with small overhead on time and storage. © 1967-2012 IEEE.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85077749140&doi=10.1109%2fTVT.2019.2943118&partnerID=40&md5=8d4d1191b873c4c37520842eb361cf14,IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology,2019
Pixel and feature level based domain adaptation for object detection in autonomous driving,"Annotating large-scale datasets to train modern convolutional neural networks is prohibitively expensive and time-consuming for many real tasks. One alternative is to train the model on labeled synthetic datasets and apply it in the real scenes. However, this straightforward method often fails to generalize well mainly due to the domain bias between the synthetic and real datasets. Many unsupervised domain adaptation (UDA) methods were introduced to address this problem but most of them only focused on the simple classification task. This paper presents a novel UDA model which integrates both image and feature level based adaptations to solve the cross-domain object detection problem. We employ objectives of the generative adversarial network and the cycle consistency loss for image translation. Furthermore, region proposal based feature adversarial training and classification are proposed to further minimize the domain shifts and preserve the semantics of the target objects. Extensive experiments are conducted on several different adaptation scenarios, and the results demonstrate the robustness and superiority of the proposed method. © 2019",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85070501446&doi=10.1016%2fj.neucom.2019.08.022&partnerID=40&md5=222a7fd652da78e94673b019e32c5844,Neurocomputing,2019
Learning single-shot vehicle orientation estimation from large-scale street panoramas,"Modern autonomous driving techniques harness a variety of visual cues for performing key tasks like vehicle steering and collision avoidance. This work defines for the first time and proposes a solution to the following problem: can one precisely estimate an autonomous vehicle's orientation relative to the road by taking a picture from within the vehicle? Vehicle orientation supplies crucial information for making various driving-related decisions. The key challenge of this problem is the lack of training data, since accurately annotating vehicle's orientation information in an image is in general difficult. To circumvent the data scarcity issue, we propose to leverage publicly-available street panoramas as those found in GoogleMaps. Street panoramas are essentially defined by 2-D plenoptic functions that map the visual environment to a sphere. One can thus effortlessly collect annotated data for the interested task by specifying a direction and reading out corresponding pixels from a panorama. This way we collect a city-scale large benchmark TB500K for studying this problem. Our second contribution is the exposition of a two-stream deep network for attacking this problem. Intuitively, visual/semantic and geometric (e.g., the direction of road lanes) cues are both crucial and complement each other. Our proposed two-stream network can jointly learn from both cues and serves as a reasonable baseline for this novel problem. In addition, several experiments are also conducted to reveal key factors in estimating the vehicle orientation. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85071087249&doi=10.1016%2fj.neucom.2019.07.060&partnerID=40&md5=b558cfd6c36c0c0f242f491674a27f21,Neurocomputing,2019
A Predictive Perception Model and Control Strategy for Collision-Free Autonomous Driving,"A key issue in autonomous driving is the problem of decision logic, particularly, as it pertains to mixed traffic involving autonomous and human-driven vehicles. With this in mind, we develop an approach for modeling the interaction between autonomous and human-driven (or perhaps other autonomous) vehicles via game theory and assess the time evolution of potential collision paths via a reachability analysis of the solution set of a simple hybrid dynamical system that captures the kinematics of the lane-change process. We further utilize a control strategy based on model predictive control to develop a safety-assured motion profile on the part of the subject vehicle. This model is subsequently evaluated in multiple simulation scenarios as a function of a programmable safety assurance parameter. We should emphasize that the proposed approach is proactive in its outlook, as it considers a temporal horizon spanning several seconds and assumes a certain behavioral consistency on the part of the local traffic participants. As such it must be augmented with an appropriate reactive collision mitigation scheme that responds to immediate threats caused by abrupt behaviors that are not predictable via algorithmic schemes. Nevertheless, the scenarios studied here appear to produce intuitively reasonable behaviors that seem consistent with ordinary driving and highlight the prospects of this approach being implemented in autonomous driving strategies. © 2000-2011 IEEE.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85058139908&doi=10.1109%2fTITS.2018.2880409&partnerID=40&md5=2e7145ac6fcb3873761b796c8317779e,IEEE Transactions on Intelligent Transportation Systems,2019
Generation of a reduced-order model of an Unmanned Combat Air Vehicle using indicial response functions,"Within the NATO STO AVT-251 Task Group, a generic Unmanned Combat Air Vehicle (UCAV) planform was redesigned based on requirements derived from parts of the flight envelope of the defined mission. Because of the lambda-shape planform and associated flow phenomena including shocks and vortices, the aerodynamic design process relies heavily on high-fidelity predictions from computational fluid dynamics (CFD). These simulations enable accurate flight dynamics predictions, allowing for the identification of any potential performance issues early in the design process. Potentially, a complete flight dynamics model can be derived from CFD calculations provided that the underlying reduced order model (ROM) captures the underlying physics contained within the CFD results. This work investigates the creation of a nonlinear ROM using indicial response functions. The response functions are obtained using a grid motion approach that separates the effects of angle of attack and pitch rate. This approach is demonstrated using three different CFD codes from various organizations: ENSOLV at Royal Netherlands Aerospace Centre, USM3D at NASA Langley Research Center, and Kestrel at the United States Air Force Academy. ROM predictions were generated for a manoeuver resembling a low-speed pull-up. The predictions are found to be sensitive to the quality of the steady-state solutions from which step-response calculations were started, as well as the convergence of the step responses themselves. Nevertheless, the indicial response method is shown to provide aerodynamic predictions with acceptable accuracy including transient effects, and as such is a promising method for computationally efficient flight dynamics predictions. © 2019 Elsevier Masson SAS",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85075342084&doi=10.1016%2fj.ast.2019.105510&partnerID=40&md5=648b7253461bcaaee81de7b5eb7c7232,Aerospace Science and Technology,2019
Object Detection from a Few LIDAR Scanning Planes,"LIDAR sensors enable object and free-space detection for intelligent transportation systems and vehicles. This paper proposes a recognition method for LIDARs based on only a few detection planes. This method is useful especially in the case when the angular resolution of the scan is sufficient, but in the vertical direction the planes are far from each other. We use Fourier descriptor to characterize a scan plane and Convolutional Neural Network for classification. Our method exploits both time varying shape information and contours from multiple scan planes if available. The method performs at least as well as the state of the art algorithms in case of near field, and it also expands the detection range. It was evaluated on tens of thousands of samples from large public datasets and we did separate evaluation for far field objects as well. © 2016 IEEE.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85082631587&doi=10.1109%2fTIV.2019.2938109&partnerID=40&md5=3aa453baa222397c1a512224ecb01326,IEEE Transactions on Intelligent Vehicles,2019
Rechargeable Multi-UAV Aided Seamless Coverage for QoS-Guaranteed IoT Networks,"Due to their high flexibility, high maneuverability, and line-of-sight (LOS) predominant channel, unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) serving as flying base stations have received a lot of interest in emerging Internet of Things (IoT) networks. This article studies the energy-efficient cooperative strategy of rechargeable multi-UAVs for providing seamless coverage and long-term information services for IoT nodes. Considering the limited cruising duration of the UAV, multiple rechargeable UAVs are capable of constructing a closed chain for the sake of alternately supporting IoT nodes. Moreover, a joint IoT node assignment and UAV configuration optimization problem is proposed in order to maximize the energy efficiency of the system. Since the proposed problem is a mixed-integer nonconvex problem, we divide it into three subproblems, namely, node assignment scheduling, UAV trajectory planning, and transmit power control. By exploiting sequential convex optimization techniques, we reformulate the nonconvex subproblems into three convex optimization problems which can be solved within the polynomial time. A block coordinate descent-based iterative algorithm is proposed for solving these energy-efficiency oriented subproblems. Finally, the simulation results corroborate the effectiveness of our proposed method. © 2014 IEEE.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85076743379&doi=10.1109%2fJIOT.2019.2943147&partnerID=40&md5=18f2d4059eb65946394b5397abbcb018,IEEE Internet of Things Journal,2019
Toward Accurate Vehicle State Estimation Under Non-Gaussian Noises,"Vehicle state including location and motion information plays an important role in various applications such as Internet of Vehicles (IoV), autonomous cars, and driving safety monitoring. Achieving accurate vehicle state is a challenging task in those applications due to the noise disturbances. Recent studies suggest that noise is not generally Gaussian distributed and many physical environments can be handled more accurately as non-Gaussian rather than Gaussian model. Inspired by this observation, we strive to improve the vehicle state estimation by investigating the effects of that assumption when process and measurement noises are non-Gaussian distributed. Here, process noise represents the noise during the state information processing. To that end, we exploit the generalized error distribution (GED) to compute the non-Gaussian probability density during the vehicle state estimation. We then derive extensive theoretical analysis targeting to estimate the parameters such as the mean and the variance (or covariance matrix) related to both process and measurement noises and reduce the computational burden of the distribution. Further, we propose a non-Gaussian particle filter for vehicle state estimation ( nGPF-VSE) algorithm wherein we utilize the genetic operator resampling (GOR) technique to enhance the efficiency of particle filter (PF) relying on the selection of the importance sampling distribution. To evaluate the performance of the proposed approach, we conduct numerical simulations on the popular system of state-space equations and a real experiment for estimating the vehicle state. The results from the numerical simulations, experimental data and the statistical evaluation confirm that nGPF-VSE outperforms existing methods in terms of vehicle state accuracy. © 2014 IEEE.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85076778896&doi=10.1109%2fJIOT.2019.2940412&partnerID=40&md5=2f3f6af21655979763b1a64f59bd7416,IEEE Internet of Things Journal,2019
Routing and Scheduling for Hybrid Truck-Drone Collaborative Parcel Delivery With Independent and Truck-Carried Drones,"The enabling Internet-of-Things (IoT) technology has inspired a large number of novel platforms and applications. One popular IoT platform is unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs, also known as drone). Benefiting from the intrinsic flexibility, convenience, and low cost, UAVs have great potentials to be utilized in various civil applications, including parcel delivery. However, suffering from limited payloads and battery capacities, it is uneconomical for UAVs to perform parcel delivery tasks independently. To conquer the drawbacks of low payloads and battery capacities, people propose to employ both trucks and drones to construct truck-drone parcel delivery systems. However, previous works only leverage either independent drones or truck-carried drones to collaborate with trucks. In contrast, in this article we propose to simultaneously employ trucks, truck-carried drones, and independent drones to construct a more efficient truck-drone parcel delivery system. We claim that such a hybrid parcel delivery system can fully exploit the complementary benefits of the three platforms. We propose a novel routing and scheduling algorithm, referred to as hybrid truck-drone delivery (HTDD) algorithm, to solve the hybrid parcel delivery problem, wherein M drones carried by M trucks, together with N independent drones, cooperate to deliver parcels to customers distributed in a wide region. The experimental results show that our algorithm outperforms the existing solutions which employ either independent drones or truck-carried drones. © 2014 IEEE.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85076267895&doi=10.1109%2fJIOT.2019.2939397&partnerID=40&md5=b67afeeedaf394550c2c344338ba9a29,IEEE Internet of Things Journal,2019
Deployment Algorithms of Flying Base Stations: 5G and Beyond With UAVs,"Exploiting unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) as flying base stations (BSs) to assist the terrestrial cellular networks is promising in 5G and beyond. Despite the inherent potentials, one challenging problem is how to optimally deploy multiple UAVs to achieve on-demand coverage for ground user equipment (UE). In this article, we model the deployment problem as minimizing the number of UAVs and maximizing the load balance among them, which is subject to two main constraints, i.e., UAVs should form a robust backbone network and they should keep connected with the fixed BSs. To solve this optimization problem with low complexity, we decompose the problem into two subproblems and propose a hybrid algorithm to solve them stepwise. First, a centralized greedy search algorithm is used to heuristically obtain the minimum number of UAVs and their suboptimal positions in a discontinuous space. Then, a distributed motion algorithm is adopted which enables each UAV to autonomously control its motion toward the optimal position in a continuous space. The proposed algorithm is applicable to various scenarios where UAVs are deployed alone or with fixed BSs regardless of the UE distribution. Extensive simulations validate the proposed algorithm. © 2014 IEEE.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85076753730&doi=10.1109%2fJIOT.2019.2935105&partnerID=40&md5=4166599a2290269058186b6200c163e2,IEEE Internet of Things Journal,2019
Collision risk management for non-cooperative UAS traffic in airport-restricted airspace with alert zones based on probabilistic conflict map,"Recent years have seen an increase in reported unmanned aerial systems (UAS) incursion into terminal airspace, likely due to the ease of access to recreational UAS to the general public with minimal understanding of aviation regulations. Such incursions often lead to extensive airport shutdowns due to safety concern and could cause a cascading disruption to airline operations throughout the region. A better assessment tool for the collision risk between the existing air traffic and such non-cooperative intruder could help reduce unnecessary disruption while maintaining safety to air traffic operations. While advancements have been made in the past decade in detection and avoidance of UAS traffics, the systems depend on either having fully cooperative traffic or sensor capability beyond what is currently available. This paper seeks to assess the collision risk posed by an intruding UAS within the airport-restricted “terminal airspace,” in the Singapore context, with minimal information on the UAS. This was done through probabilistic conflict prediction with Monte-Carlo simulations under the assumption of a worst-case scenario involving a non-cooperative intruder traveling directly towards the flight corridor. Alert Zones within the existing 5 km terminal airspace could be constructed using the collision prediction models to help air traffic controllers quickly identifying UAS that poses a threat under most circumstances, with the information passed on to the pilot for mitigation actions. Simulations were conducted for a number of conflict-pairs to investigate how the resulting Alert Zones differ. Finally, this paper also investigates how the incorporation of UAS tracking information, under the current reliability level, could be used to augment the collision prediction algorithm and its effect on the management of collision risks in terminal airspace. The result suggested that the method that utilizes the most available information for UAS path modeling could be used with the currently available sensors to produce acceptable collision prediction results. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85073979957&doi=10.1016%2fj.trc.2019.09.017&partnerID=40&md5=dd1d61c2fc54bfccad2c3f5cee3ad8ff,Transportation Research Part C: Emerging Technologies,2019
Cooperative trajectory planning for haptic shared control between driver and automation in highway driving,"This paper addresses the driver-automation shared driving control for lane keeping and obstacle avoidance of automated vehicles in highway traffic. The proposed shared control framework is established from a novel cooperative trajectory planning algorithm and a fuzzy steering controller. Based on polynomial functions, the cooperative trajectory planning is formulated by judiciously exploiting the information on the maneuver decision, the conflict management, and the driver monitoring. As a result, the planned trajectory of the vehicle is continuously adapted according to the driver's actions and intentions. By means of Lyapunov stability arguments, sufficient conditions in terms of linear matrix inequalities are given to design a Takagi-Sugeno fuzzy model-based controller. This robust steering controller provides a necessary assistive torque to track the planned vehicle trajectory. The new shared driving control framework allows reducing effectively the driver-automation conflict issue while offering the driver more freedom to swerve within a predefined lane. The advantages of the proposed approach are evaluated using both objective and subjective results, experimentally obtained from several human drivers and an advanced interactive dynamic driving simulator. © 1982-2012 IEEE.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85070471975&doi=10.1109%2fTIE.2019.2893864&partnerID=40&md5=6d4a7e3906db2f02071634382d985a10,IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics,2019
Cooperative Shock Waves Mitigation in Mixed Traffic Flow Environment,"Human driver behavior strongly influences traffic flow by increasing the spread of shock waves in a downstream direction. This paper addresses the problem of traffic congestion mitigation in a mixed scenario composed of connected human-driven and autonomous vehicles. The control protocol, driving the longitudinal motion of the autonomous vehicles, is designed for damping down traffic waves. The effectiveness of the strategy, and ability to cope with multiple and time-varying delays originated by the non-ideal wireless communication among connected vehicles, is both analytically and numerically analyzed. The asymptotic stability of the algorithm is mathematically proved by leveraging a Lyapunov-Krasovskii functional, while the head-to-tail stability tool is exploited for the tuning of the control gains. The performance of the control strategy is disclosed by using hardware-in-the-loop real-time simulation for an exemplary pattern of three vehicles. The effectiveness of the proposed cooperative strategy in longer queues of vehicles is, instead, investigated through PLEXE, an inter-vehicular communication and mobility simulator that includes features for autonomous vehicles as well as for the realistic emulation of the IEEE 802.11p standard. The results confirm the robustness of the approach and its ability in damping disturbances and mitigating stop-and-go effects according to the theoretical derivation. © 2000-2011 IEEE.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85065490992&doi=10.1109%2fTITS.2018.2883485&partnerID=40&md5=41a0de9dbeca3adb7860fa651d927e3b,IEEE Transactions on Intelligent Transportation Systems,2019
Security Implications of Intentional Capacitive Crosstalk,"With advances in shrinking process technology sizes, the parasitic effects of closely routed adjacent wires, crosstalk, still present problems in practice since they directly influence performance and functionality. Even though there is a solid understanding of parasitic effects in hardware designs, the security implications of such undesired effects have been scarcely investigated. In this paper, we leverage the physical routing effects of capacitive crosstalk to demonstrate a new parametric hardware Trojan design methodology. We show that such Trojans can be implemented by only rerouting already existing resources. Thus, our approach possesses a zero-gate area overhead which is both stealthy and challenging to detect with standard visual inspection techniques. In two case studies, we demonstrate its devastating consequences: (1) we realize an implementation attack on a third-party cryptographic AES IP core and (2) we realize a privilege escalation on a general-purpose processor capable of running any modern operating system. In these case studies, we take special care to ensure that the Trojans do not violate design rule checks, which further highlights that the capacitive crosstalk Trojans can be building blocks for malicious circuitry design. We then investigate how state-of-the-art visual inspection techniques can be enhanced to cope with parametric hardware Trojans. In particular, we develop an automated layout-level mitigation approach which exploits the characteristic wire length of capacitive crosstalk Trojans. Finally, we highlight further implementation strategies for capacitive crosstalk Trojans and pinpoint future research directions. © 2005-2012 IEEE.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85071307094&doi=10.1109%2fTIFS.2019.2900914&partnerID=40&md5=5fc0a268f23a8097c116cc800b042814,IEEE Transactions on Information Forensics and Security,2019
A Trust-Based Active Detection for Cyber-Physical Security in Industrial Environments,"For the cyber-physical systems (CPS) in the smart industrial environments, a larger amount of smart sensor nodes, processors and actuators are deployed to sense information from physical world, which is vulnerable to be attacked because the nodes are deployed in unattended areas. Security is a pivotal issue for CPS, therefore, a trust-based active detection (TBAD) scheme is proposed for improving the reliability of collecting data packets and reducing the data redundancy. In TBAD scheme, the trust of the nodes is evaluated by the neighboring nodes and the evaluation results are added into the header of data packets. Thus, according to the reliability of data packets collected by the unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV), the trust of sensor nodes is evaluated by the UAV. In addition, the evaluation trust of nodes stored in the header of data packets will be detected when the UAV suspects the stored trust of sensor nodes. Then, the trust of corresponding sensor nodes is adjusted according to the detection results. The sensor nodes with higher trust are selected to form movement trajectory. A series of simulation experiments are conducted to evaluate the performance of the scheme. The results illustrate that the proposed scheme can greatly improve the efficiency and security of data routing in CPS. © 2019 IEEE.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85073030029&doi=10.1109%2fTII.2019.2931394&partnerID=40&md5=ca831df1d472fb6fbd61f87fc3da9670,IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics,2019

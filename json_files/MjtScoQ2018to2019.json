      "abstract": "Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) are now readily available worldwide and users can easily fly them remotely using smart controllers. This has created the problem of keeping unauthorized UAVs away from private or sensitive areas where they can be a personal or public threat. This paper proposes an improved radio frequency (RF)-based method to detect UAVs. The clutter (interference) is eliminated using a background filtering method. Then singular value decomposition (SVD) and average filtering are used to reduce the noise and improve the signal to noise ratio (SNR). Spectrum accumulation (SA) and statistical fingerprint analysis (SFA) are employed to provide two frequency estimates. These estimates are used to determine if a UAV is present in the detection environment. The data size is reduced using a region of interest (ROI), and this improves the system efficiency and improves azimuth estimation accuracy. Detection results are obtained using real UAV RF signals obtained experimentally which show that the proposed method is more effective than other well-known detection algorithms. The recognition rate with this method is close to 100% within a distance of 2.4 km and greater than 90% within a distance of 3 km. Further, multiple UAVs can be detected accurately using the proposed method.",

      "abstract": "In this paper, we present a novel 2D\u20133D pedestrian tracker designed for applications in autonomous vehicles. The system operates on a tracking by detection principle and can track multiple pedestrians in complex urban traffic situations. By using a behavioral motion model and a non-parametric distribution as state model, we are able to accurately track unpredictable pedestrian motion in the presence of heavy occlusion. Tracking is performed independently, on the image and ground plane, in global, motion compensated coordinates. We employ Camera and LiDAR data fusion to solve the association problem where the optimal solution is found by matching 2D and 3D detections to tracks using a joint log-likelihood observation model. Each 2D\u20133D particle filter then updates their state from associated observations and a behavioral motion model. Each particle moves independently following the pedestrian motion parameters which we learned offline from an annotated training dataset. Temporal stability of the state variables is achieved by modeling each track as a Markov Decision Process with probabilistic state transition properties. A novel track management system then handles high level actions such as track creation, deletion and interaction. Using a probabilistic track score the track manager can cull false and ambiguous detections while updating tracks with detections from actual pedestrians. Our system is implemented on a GPU and exploits the massively parallelizable nature of particle filters. Due to the Markovian nature of our track representation, the system achieves real-time performance operating with a minimal memory footprint. Exhaustive and independent evaluation of our tracker was performed by the KITTI benchmark server, where it was tested against a wide variety of unknown pedestrian tracking situations. On this realistic benchmark, we outperform all published pedestrian trackers in a multitude of tracking metrics.",

      "abstract": "The 3D information of road infrastructures is growing in importance with the development of autonomous driving. In this context, the exact 2D position of road markings as well as height information play an important role in, e.g., lane-accurate self-localization of autonomous vehicles. In this paper, the overall task is divided into an automatic segmentation followed by a refined 3D reconstruction. For the segmentation task, we applied a wavelet-enhanced fully convolutional network on multiview high-resolution aerial imagery. Based on the resulting 2D segments in the original images, we propose a successive workflow for the 3D reconstruction of road markings based on a least-squares line-fitting in multiview imagery. The 3D reconstruction exploits the line character of road markings with the aim to optimize the best 3D line location by minimizing the distance from its back projection to the detected 2D line in all the covering images. Results showed an improved IoU of the automatic road marking segmentation by exploiting the multiview character of the aerial images and a more accurate 3D reconstruction of the road surface compared to the semiglobal matching (SGM) algorithm. Further, the approach avoids the matching problem in non-textured image parts and is not limited to lines of finite length. In this paper, the approach is presented and validated on several aerial image data sets covering different scenarios like motorways and urban regions.",

      "abstract": "The convergence of automobiles and ICT (information and communication technology) has become a new paradigm for the development of next-generation vehicles. In particular, connected cars represent the most in-demand automobile-ICT convergence technology. With the development of 5G technology, communication between vehicle and external device using autonomous driving and Internet of things (IoT) technology has been remarkably developed. Control of vehicles using smart phones has become a routine feature, and over 200 Android apps are in use. However, Android apps are easy to tamper by repackaging and allowing hackers to attack vehicles with using this vulnerability, which can lead to life-critical accidents. In this study, we analyze the vulnerabilities of connected car environments when connecting with IoT technologies and demonstrate the possibility of cyberattack by performing attack experiments using real cars and repackaging for commercial apps. Furthermore, we propose a realistic security technology as a countermeasure to attain safety against cyberattacks. To evaluate the safety of the proposed method, a security module is developed and a performance evaluation is conducted on an actual vehicle.",

      "abstract": "We present a method for the automated detection of firearms in cargo x-ray images using RetinaNet. RetinaNet is a recently proposed powerful object detection framework that is shown to surpass the detection performance of state-of-art two-stage R-CNN family object detectors while matching the speed of one-stage object detection algorithms. We trained our models from scratch by generating training data with threat image projection (TIP) that alleviates the class imbalance problem inherent to the x-ray security inspection and eliminates the need for costly and tedious staged data collection. The method is tested on unseen weapons that are also injected into unseen cargo images using TIP. Variations in cargo content and background clutter is considered in training and testing datasets. We demonstrated RetinaNet-based firearm detection model matches the detection accuracies of traditional sliding-windows convolutional neural net firearm detectors while offering more precise object localization, and significantly faster detection speed.",

      "abstract": "Search and tracking is the problem of locating a moving target and following it to its destination. In this work, we consider a scenario in which the target moves across a large geographical area by following a road network and the search is performed by a team of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs). We formulate search and tracking as a combinatorial optimization problem and prove that the objective function is submodular. We exploit this property to devise a greedy algorithm. Although this algorithm does not offer strong theoretical guarantees because of the presence of temporal constraints that limit the feasibility of the solutions, it presents remarkably good performance, especially when several UAVs are available for the mission. As the greedy algorithm suffers when resources are scarce, we investigate two alternative optimization techniques: Constraint Programming (CP) and AI planning. Both approaches struggle to cope with large problems, and so we strengthen them by leveraging the greedy algorithm. We use the greedy solution to warm start the CP model and to devise a domain-dependent heuristic for planning. Our extensive experimental evaluation studies the scalability of the different techniques and identifies the conditions under which one approach becomes preferable to the others.",

      "abstract": "Plastic debris has become an abundant pollutant in marine, coastal and riverine environments, posing a large threat to aquatic life. Effective measures to mitigate and prevent marine plastic pollution require a thorough understanding of its origin and eventual fate. Several models have estimated that land-based sources are the main source of marine plastic pollution, although field data to substantiate these estimates remain limited. Current methodologies to measure riverine plastic transport require the availability of infrastructure and accessible riverbanks, but, to obtain measurements on a higher spatial and temporal scale, new monitoring methods are required. This paper presents a new methodology for quantifying riverine plastic debris using Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs), including a first application on Klang River, Malaysia. Additional plastic measurements were done in parallel with the UAV-based approach to make comparisons between the two methods. The spatiotemporal distribution of the plastics obtained with both methods show similar patterns and variations. With this, we show that UAV-based monitoring methods are a promising alternative for currently available approaches for monitoring riverine plastic transport, especially in remote and inaccessible areas.",

      "abstract": "Due to current development trends in the automotive industry towards stronger connected and autonomous driving, the attack surface of vehicles is growing which increases the risk of security attacks. This has been confirmed by several research projects in which vehicles were attacked in order to trigger various functions. In some cases these functions were critical to operational safety. To make automotive systems more secure, concepts must be developed that take existing attacks into account. Several taxonomies were proposed to analyze and classify security attacks. However, in this paper we show that the existing taxonomies were not designed for application in the automotive development process and therefore do not provide enough degree of detail for supporting development phases such as threat analysis or security testing. In order to be able to use the information that security attacks can provide for the development of security concepts and for testing automotive systems, we propose a comprehensive taxonomy with degrees of detail which addresses these tasks. In particular, our proposed taxonomy is designed in such a wa, that each step in the vehicle development process can leverage it.",

      "abstract": "Providing a mechanism to authenticate users in healthcare applications is an essential security requirement to prevent both external and internal attackers from penetrating patients&#x2019; identities and revealing their health data. Many schemes have been developed to provide authentication mechanisms to ensure that only legitimate users are authorised to connect, but these schemes still suffer from vulnerable security. Various attacks expose patients&#x2019; data for malicious tampering or destruction. Transferring health-related data and information between users and the health centre makes them exposed to penetration by adversaries as they may move through an insecure channel. In addition, previous mechanisms have suffered from the poor protection of users&#x2019; authentication information. To ensure the protection of patients&#x2019; information and data, we propose a scheme that authenticates users based on the information of both the device and the legitimate user. In this paper, we propose a Robust Authentication Model for Healthcare Users (RAMHU) that provides mutual authentication between the server and clients. This model utilizes an Elliptic Curve Integrated Encryption Scheme (ECIES) and PHOTON to achieve strong security and good overall performance. RAMHU relies on multiple-pseudonym, physical address, and one-time password mechanisms to authenticate legitimate users. Moreover, extensive informal and formal security analysis with the automated validation of Internet security protocols and applications (AVISPA) tool demonstrate that our model offers a high level of security in repelling a wide variety of possible attacks.",

      "abstract": "Cyber-attackers are likely to exploit advances in artificial intelligence to achieve faster, stealthier, and more effective operational effects. Defenders need to keep pace by developing their own advances, which may preclude human-in-theloop decision making. Consequently, future systems will have to rely on automated reasoning and automated responses to ensure mission success and continuously adapt to an evolving adversary. Automated reasoning about defensive cyber responses is essentially sequential decision making based on the projection of possible futures from a current situation. This problem is especially complicated in cyberspace, however, because the current situation and future projections are highly uncertain. Our research tackles these challenges using the formal framework of partially observable Markov decision problems (POMDPs). We show how to break the \u201ccurse of dimensionality\u201d that makes these problems intractable by computing approximate solutions using a Monte Carlo online planner that incorporates a computationally feasible simulation of the cyber security problem. Our simulation is an extension of MITRE\u2019s Cyber Security Game simulator, which explores the mission-impact-focused strategies of an adaptive, intelligent attacker. Preliminary results on small problems, where the optimal solution can be calculated precisely, show that our approach consistently finds the optimal answer, not just a good approximation. We are in the process of increasing the fidelity of the simulator and POMDP representation to model more realistic cyber environments by increasing attacker and defender actions, increasing the variety of sensor types (including sensing of both actions and states), accounting for multiple incident effects, and improving the scaling properties.",

      "abstract": "The PSO (Particle Swarm Optimization) algorithm uses a population of single particles, randomly distributed over the function search space, in order to construct an optimal flight path. During the algorithm iteration execution, each particle evaluates its fitness function according to the actual position. Then, every particle moves towards a direction dependent on its actual best position and the position of the best particle so far. The procedure ends when the iteration limit is reached or fitness criterium is met. In the presented autonomous UAV 3D path planning method, a PSO algorithm is used to build a feasible path, optimized in terms of fuel and threat cost. The process begins when the UAV detects or receives information about threats appearing on its primary trajectory. The population of particles moves in the search space of three variables, which are the angles of pitch, roll and yaw. These angles determine the spatial orientation of the UAV, indicating its direction of movement in each step. Further waypoints are chosen with consideration of the distance to the target and violation of threat areas. As a final result, the PSO algorithm constructs a suboptimal, feasible path which could be used as a reference trajectory for the UAV\u2019s automatic control system. Simulation results turned out to be completely repeatable and indistinguishable, despite the stochastic nature of the algorithm, which proves its great optimization abilities. Moreover, its short execution time (within seconds) allows this procedure to be used in real time applications.",

      "abstract": "A real time program is implemented to classify different model airplanes imaged using a 32x32 SPAD array camera in time-of-flight mode. The algorithm uses random feature extractors in series with a linear classifier and is implemented on the NVIDIA Jetson TX2 platform, a power efficient embedded computing device. The algorithm is trained by calculating the classification matrix using a simple pseudoinverse operation on collected image data with known corresponding object labels. The implementation in this work uses a combination of serial and parallel processes and is optimized for classifying airplane models imaged by the SPAD and laser system. The performance of different numbers of convolutional filters is tested in real time. The classification accuracy reaches up to 98.7% and the execution time on the TX2 varies between 34.30 and 73.55 ms depending on the number of convolutional filters used. Furthermore, image acquisition and classification use 5.1 W of power on the TX2 board. Along with its small size and low weight, the TX2 platform can be exploited for high-speed operation in applications that require classification of aerial targets where the SPAD imaging system and embedded device are mounted on a UAS.",

      "abstract": "Unmanned aircraft systems (UAS) have gained utility in the Navy for many purposes, including facility needs, security, and intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance (ISR). UAS surveys can be employed in place of personnel to reduce safety risks, but they generate significant quantities of data that often require manual review. Research and development of automated methods to identify targets of interest in this type of imagery data can provide multiple benefits, including increasing efficiency, decreasing cost, and potentially saving lives through identification of hazards or threats. This paper presents a methodology to efficiently and effectively identify cryptic target objects from UAS imagery. The approach involves flight and processing of airborne imagery in low-light conditions to find low-profile objects (i.e., birds) in beach and desert-like environments. The object classification algorithms combat the low-light conditions and low-profile nature of the objects of interest using cascading models and a tailored deep convolutional neural network (CNN) architecture. Models were able to identify and count endangered birds (California least terns) and nesting sites on beaches from UAS survey data, achieving negative/positive classification accuracies from candidate images upwards of 97% and an <i>f</i><sub>1</sub> score for detection of 0:837.",

      "abstract": "Adoptive transfer of T regulatory cells (Treg) has been successfully exploited in the context of graft-versus-host disease, transplantation and autoimmune disease. For the majority of applications, clinical administration of Treg requires laborious ex vivo expansion and typically involves open handling for culture feeds and repetitive sampling. Here we show results from our approach to translate manual Treg manufacturing to the fully closed automated CliniMACS Prodigy\u00ae system reducing contamination risk, hands-on time and quality variation from human intervention. Polyclonal Treg were isolated from total nucleated cells obtained through leukapheresis of healthy donors by CD8+ cell depletion and subsequent CD25high enrichment. Treg were expanded with the CliniMACS Prodigy\u00ae device using clinical grade cell culture medium, rapamycin, IL-2 and \u03b1CD3/\u03b1CD28 beads for 13-14 days. We successfully integrated expansion bead removal and final formulation into the automated procedure, finalizing the process with a ready to use product for bedside transfusion. Automated Treg expansion was conducted in parallel to an established manual manufacturing process using G-Rex cell culture flasks. We could prove similar expansion kinetics leading to a cell yield of up to 2.12x109 cells with the CliniMACS Prodigy\u00ae and comparable product phenotype of >90% CD4+CD25highCD127lowFOXP3+ cells that had similar in vitro immunosuppressive function. Efficiency of expansion bead depletion was comparable to the CliniMACS\u00ae Plus system and the final ready-to-infuse product had phenotype stability and high vitality after overnight storage. We anticipate this newly developed closed system expansion approach to be a starting point for the development of enhanced throughput clinical scale Treg manufacture, and for safe automated generation of antigen-specific Treg grafted with a chimeric antigen receptor (CAR Treg).",

      "abstract": "The number of reported incidents caused by UAVs, intentional as well as accidental, is rising. To avoid such incidents in future, it is essential to be able to detect UAVs. However, not every UAV is a potential threat and therefore the UAV not only has to be detected, but classified or identified. 360<sup>o</sup> scanning LiDAR systems can be deployed for the detection and tracking of (micro) UAVs in ranges up to 50 m. Unfortunately, the verification and classification of the detected objects is not possible in most cases, due to the low resolution of that kind of sensor. In this paper, we propose an automatic alignment of an additional sensor (mounted on a pan-tilt head) for the identification of the detected objects. The classification sensor is directed by the tracking results of the panoramic LiDAR sensor. If the alignable sensor is an RGB- or infrared camera, the identification of the objects can be done by state-of-the-art image processing algorithms. If a higher-resolution LiDAR sensor is used for this task, algorithms have to be developed and implemented. For example, the classification could be realized by a 3D model matching method. After the handoff of the object position from the 360<sup>o</sup> LiDAR to the verification sensor, this second system can be used for a further tracking of the object, e.g., if the trajectory of the UAV leaves the field of view of the primary LiDAR system. The paper shows first results of this multi-sensor classification approach.",

      "abstract": "Aspergillus sp. fungi cause various diseases in both immunocompetent and immunocompromised patients. The most frequent Aspergillus disorders include chronic pulmonary aspergillosis (CPA), a life-threatening disease that affects at least 3 million people worldwide, and allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis (ABPA), which affects approximately 4.8 million severe asthmatic patients globally. Diagnosis of such diseases involves IgG serological testing; however, the currently available anti-Aspergillus IgG detection assays are inappropriate for resource-poor laboratory settings, as they are expensive, rely on automated procedures, and require stable electrical power. Therefore, accurate CPA or ABPA diagnosis facilities are lacking in most low- and middle-income countries. We evaluated a novel anti-Aspergillus antibody immunochromatographic test (ICT) that requires minimal laboratory equipment. Two evaluations were performed: a single-center four-month prospective study in a French reference laboratory (44 cases /257 patients) and a retrospective study in five French reference laboratories (262 cases and 188 controls). We estimated the ICT indices for the diagnosis of chronic aspergillosis, and the test results were compared to those of anti-Aspergillus IgG immunoblot (IB) assay. Of the 713 patients included in the study, 306 had chronic aspergillosis. Test sensitivity and specificity were 88.9% (95%CI[85-92]) and 96.3% (95%CI[94-98]) for the ICT and 93.1% (95%CI[90-96]) and 94.3% (95%CI[92-96]) for the IB, respectively. Agreement between the two assays was almost perfect (kappa=0.86). As this ICT displays good diagnostic performance and complies with the ASSURED (Affordable, Sensitive, Specific, User-friendly, Equipment-free and Delivered) criteria, we concluded that this anti-Aspergillus antibody ICT can be used to diagnose Aspergillus diseases in resource-poor settings.",

      "abstract": "The focus of this current research is two-fold: (1) to understand how team interaction in human-autonomy teams (HAT)s evolve in the Remotely Piloted Aircraft Systems (RPAS) task context, and (2) to understand how HATs respond to three types of failures (automation, autonomy, and cyber-attack) over time. We summarize the findings from three of our recent experiments regarding the team interaction within HAT over time in the dynamic context of RPAS. For the first and the second experiments, we summarize general findings related to team member interaction of a three-member team over time, by comparison of HATs with all-human teams. In the third experiment, which extends beyond the first two experiments, we investigate HAT evolution when HATs are faced with three types of failures during the task. For all three of these experiments, measures focus on team interactions and temporal dynamics consistent with the theory of interactive team cognition. We applied Joint Recurrence Quantification Analysis, to communication flow in the three experiments. One of the most interesting and significant findings from our experiments regarding team evolution is the idea of entrainment, that one team member (the pilot in our study, either agent or human) can change the communication behaviors of the other teammates over time, including coordination, and affect team performance. In the first and second studies, behavioral passiveness of the synthetic teams resulted in very stable and rigid coordination in comparison to the all-human teams that were less stable. Experimenter teams demonstrated metastable coordination (not rigid nor unstable) and performed better than rigid and unstable teams during the dynamic task. In the third experiment, metastable behavior helped teams overcome all three types of failures. These summarized findings address three potential future needs for ensuring effective HAT: (1) training of autonomous agents on the principles of teamwork, specifically understanding tasks and roles of teammates, (2) human-centered machine learning design of the synthetic agent so the agents can better understand human behavior and ultimately human needs, and (3) training of human members to communicate and coordinate with agents due to current limitations of Natural Language Processing of the agents.",

      "abstract": "The increasingly intelligent, highly complex, technical systems of tomorrow - for instance autonomous vehicles - result in the necessity for a systematic security- and safety-oriented development process that starts in the early phases of system design. Automotive Systems Engineering (ASE) as one approach is increasingly gaining ground in the automotive industry. However, this approach is still in a prototype stage. The consideration of security and safety within the early stages of systems design leads to so- called ill-defined problems. Such are not covered by ASE, but can be addressed by means of Design Thinking. Therefore we introduce an approach to combine both approaches. Based on this combination, we derive potentials in the context of the consideration of security and safety. Essential advantages are the possibility to think ahead of threat scenarios at an early stage in system design. Due to an incomplete database, this is not supported or only partially supported by conventional approaches. The resulting potentials are derived based upon a practical example.",

      "abstract": "One of the main challenges in assessing marine biodiversity is the lack of consistent approaches to monitor it. This threatens to undermine ocean best practice in marine monitoring, as it impedes a reduction in the bias and variance of sampled data and restricts the confidence in the advice that can be given. In particular, there is potential for confounding between the monitoring methods, their measured ecological properties, and the questions they seek to answer. Australia has developed significant long-term marine monitoring and observing programs and has one of the largest marine estates, including the world\u2019s largest representative network of marine parks. This new network will require ongoing monitoring and evaluation, beyond what direct funding can support, so needs to be integrated in a standardised way with other national programs to develop sufficient monitoring capacity. The aim of this paper is to describe the process undertaken in developing a suite of field manuals that provide standard operating procedures (SOPs) for marine sampling in Australian waters so that data are comparable over time and space, thereby supporting a robust, cost-effective, and objective national monitoring program. We encourage readers to refer to the complete manuals of interest at www.nespmarine.edu.au/field-manuals. Collaboration was a key characteristic of our approach so rather than single groups trying to impose their standards, more than 70 individuals from over 30 organisations contributed to the first version of this field manual package.",

      "abstract": "Differential Fault Analysis (DFA) is considered as the most popular fault analysis method. While there are techniques that provide a fault analysis automation on the cipher level to some degree, it can be shown that when it comes to software implementations, there are new vulnerabilities, which cannot be found by observing the cipher design specification.This work bridges the gap by providing a fully automated way to carry out DFA on assembly implementations of symmetric block ciphers. We use a customized data flow graph to represent the program and develop a novel fault analysis methodology to capture the program behavior under faults. We establish an effective description of DFA as constraints that are passed to an SMT solver. We create a tool that takes assembly code as input, analyzes the dependencies among instructions, automatically attacks vulnerable instructions using SMT solver and outputs the attack details that recover the last round key (and possibly the earlier keys). We support our design with evaluations on lightweight ciphers SIMON, SPECK, and PRIDE, and a current NIST standard, AES. By automated assembly analysis, we were able to find new efficient DFA attacks on SPECK and PRIDE, exploiting implementation specific vulnerabilities, and previously published DFA on SIMON and AES. Moreover, we present a novel DFA on multiplication operation that has never been shown for symmetric block ciphers before. Our experimental evaluation also shows reasonable execution times that are scalable to current cipher designs and can easily outclass the manual analysis. Moreover, we present a method to check the countermeasure-protected implementations in a way that helps implementers to decide how many rounds should be protected. We note that this is the first work that automatically carries out DFA on cipher implementations without any plaintext or ciphertext information and therefore, can be generally applied to any input data to the cipher.",

      "abstract": "This paper deals with a simulator that evaluates weapon allocation algorithms for missile defense systems. A combat system that allows for an immediate response to a rapidly developing offshore air threat is essential, and weapon allocation is vital. To achieve this, it is necessary to evaluate and improve the existing threat evaluation and weapon allocation algorithms. However, the existing weapon allocation algorithm has been assumed to be static, because it is not easy to fill the gap of real time due to elements such as time and distance. Thus, we introduce a concept of unit time in the simulation and design a simulator that can evaluate the weapon allocation algorithm more realistically by covering the gap between the static weapon allocation algorithm and the real-time dynamic battlefield environment. Based on this, we evaluate the existing algorithms.",

      "abstract": "Galactic swarm optimization (GSO) is a recently created metaheuristic which is inspired by the motion of galaxies and stars in the universe. This algorithm gives us the possibility of finding the global optimum with greater precision since it uses multiple exploration and exploitation cycles. In this paper we present a modification to galactic swarm optimization using type-1 (T1) and interval type-2 (IT2) fuzzy systems for the dynamic adjustment of the c3 and c4 parameters in the algorithm. In addition, the modification is used for the optimization of the fuzzy controller of an autonomous mobile robot. First, the galactic swarm optimization is tested for fuzzy controller optimization. Second, the GSO algorithm with the dynamic adjustment of parameters using T1 fuzzy systems is used for the optimization of the fuzzy controller of an autonomous mobile robot. Finally, the GSO algorithm with the dynamic adjustment of parameters using the IT2 fuzzy systems is applied to the optimization of the fuzzy controller. In the proposed approaches, perturbation (noise) was added to the plant in order to find out if our approach behaves well under perturbation to the autonomous mobile robot plant; additionally, we consider our ability to compare the results obtained with the approaches when no perturbation is considered.",

      "abstract": "In recent years, much attention has been paid to autonomous vehicles and security threats on such vehicles have become an important issue. One of these examples is a command injection issue on a gateway ECU, which was reported in 2016. In order to mitigate these threats, the secure design of connected vehicle systems, which is done at the concept phase during development, has become increasingly important in industry. From this perspective, a security guideline such as JASO TP15002 which specifies two concrete methods, CRSS (CVSS Based Risk Scoring System) and RSMA (Risk Scoring Methodology for Automotive System), was made public in 2015. The latest work on the application of TP15002 to the ITU-T X.1373 standard was published in 2017. However, the risk assessment in this publication seems limited. It is not clear from this publication how systematically the risk assessment task in TP15002 can be performed at the implementation level. Another interesting question is how different methods affect the risk scores of connected vehicle systems. In this paper, we focus on the risk assessment phase in JASO TP15002. For a systematic risk assessment, we introduce an idea of asset container and propose to extend CRSS to a novel RSS (Risk Scoring System), RSS-CVSSv3, by appropriately replacing CVSSv2 vulnerability scoring system on which CRSS is based with CVSSv3. To address the above questions, we perform a comparative study on CRSS, RSMA, and RSS-CVSSv3 for multiple use cases such as a CGW (Central Gateway) and a drone, to examine the efficiency and usefulness of our methods. For this comparative purpose, we devise an interesting approach for the refinement of RSMA to the obstacles in comparing CRSS with RSMA.",

      "abstract": "<h3>Background</h3>\n<p>Endophthalmitis, a sight-threatening intraocular infection, can be of postsurgical, post-traumatic or endogenous origin. Laboratory diagnosis-based appropriate therapy can be vision-saving. Conventional culture-based laboratory diagnosis takes time and lacks sensitivity. In this study a broad-range PCR assay was assessed against conventional and automated culture methods in vitreous specimens for accurate microbiological diagnosis.</p><h3>Aims</h3>\n<p>To use broad-range PCR assay targeting 16S ribosomal RNA (rRNA) region of bacteria and to assess its performance vis-\u00e0-vis conventional and automated culture methods in the laboratory diagnosis of endophthalmitis.</p><h3>Methods</h3>\n<p>Vitreous specimens from 195 patients with clinically diagnosed endophthalmitis were processed for classical and automated culture methods, antimicrobial sensitivity and broad-range PCR assay targeting 762 bp region of 16S rRNA followed by nucleotide sequencing by Sanger\u2019s method. Causative agents were identified from the nucleotide sequences analysed against the GenBank database, and organisms were identified using the Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute (CLSI) MM18A guidelines.</p><h3>Results</h3>\n<p>Bacteria could be detected from 127 (65.13%) of the 195 vitreous specimens by broad-range PCR assay; bacterial isolation was possible from 17 (8.7%) and 60 (30.76%) of these specimens by conventional and automated culture methods, respectively (p&lt;0.0001). PCR assay could detect two uncultured bacterium, and in five cases the bacterial identity could not be determined from NCBI database matching.</p><h3>Conclusion</h3>\n<p>Broad-range PCR assay could provide definitive microbial diagnosis within 24 hours in significantly more patients (p&lt;0.0001). Some rare organisms could be detected, useful in treatment modalities. Automated culture was significantly more sensitive than conventional culture.</p>",

      "abstract": "<i>Mikania micrantha</i> is a harmful foreign invasive species, which poses a great threat to the ecological balance and forestry production in southern China. In the study, typical <i>Mikania micrantha</i> multi-incidence area was used as the research area. After data pre-processing, 250 bands were obtained and subjected to a single factor ANOVA analysis. Anterior 10 bands with F values from the largest to the smallest were selected as the spectral characteristic bands. Spectral characteristics were extracted, together with texture characteristics. Texture characteristic of hyperspectral data was calculated by Gray level co-occurrence matrix, with processing window sizes of 11, 15, 21, 31, 41, 51, respectively. Results showed that the mean and second moment in processing window of 15 was more appropriate. A total of 200 verification points were randomly selected from five flight concentration areas. Visual interpretation was performed to verify the accuracy of the extraction. Results showed that the total accuracy was 85.5%. In this paper, key technology of unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) hyperspectral remote sensing for extracting <i>Mikania micrantha</i> was studied, having constructed process of extracting the <i>Mikania micrantha</i> range by UAV hyperspectral data. Research results provide a new technical reference for the extraction of <i>Mikania micrantha</i>.",

      "abstract": "System solutions for commercial applications such as autonomous driving, augmented reality, medical imaging, and security imaging, exploit active illumination. In these applications, the active source is used to provide photons but also to code and decode relevant information such as range or spectral response. The wavelengths of choice range from visible to millimeter waves depending on the application and associated requirements. Across these wavelengths, the targets range from Lambertian to specular. For single element and scanned systems, ranging is commonly modeled using conventions borrowed from the radar and antenna community. Staring and scanning systems that facilitate resolution in the cross-range are modeled using conventions borrowed from the synthetic aperture radar community or the passive imaging community. All the borrowed conventions, however, make assumptions about the size and nature of the target in relationship to the illumination and wavelength, unresolved versus resolved and Lambertian versus specular. These assumptions are relevant for the calculation of system signal to noise ratio and resolution; therefore, they should be carefully considered when adopting the conventions. Examples of systems where modeling falls between active radar and passive imaging include wide band Terahertz array imaging systems and solid state lidar systems. This paper generalizes and bridges the models used by the active radar community and the passive imaging community. We apply the model to a wide band terahertz array imaging system enabled by terahertz array technology recently developed at imec. The model is validated using simulated measurements from a two-dimensional terahertz array.",

      "abstract": "<h3>Background/Aim</h3>\n<p>Fractionated conformal radiotherapy (FCRT) is now used to treat vision-threatening optic nerve sheath meningioma (ONSM), but long-term efficacy and safety data are lacking; the purpose of this study was to assess these key data.</p><h3>Methods</h3>\n<p>This is a retrospective chart review with prospective follow-up of adult patients treated with FCRT for primary ONSM at four academic medical centres between 1995 and 2007 with \u226510 years of follow-up after treatment.</p><h3>Results</h3>\n<p>16 patients were identified with a mean post-treatment follow-up of 14.6 years (range: 10.5\u201320.7 years). The mean age at symptom onset was 47.6 years (range: 36\u201360 years). FCRT was performed at a mean of 2.3 years after symptom onset (range: 0.2\u201314.0 years). At last follow-up, visual acuity had improved or stabilised in 14 of the 16 (88%) patients, and 11 (69%) had retained or achieved \u226520/40. The mean deviation on automated perimetry remained stable (\u221214.5 dB pretreatment vs \u221212.2 dB at last follow-up; p=0.68, n=10). Two (11%) patients had persistent pain, proptosis or diplopia, compared with six (38%) pretreatment (p=0.11). Two (13%) patients developed radiation retinopathy more than 6 months after completion of therapy, one (50%) of whom had worse visual acuity compared with pretreatment. No patient developed tumour involvement or radiation damage in the fellow eye.</p><h3>Conclusion</h3>\n<p>FCRT stabilises or improves visual function in patients with primary ONSM and is associated with a low risk of significant ocular sequelae. This treatment should be considered instead of surgery in patients with primary ONSM who require intervention due to loss of visual sensory and/or ocular motor function.</p>",

      "abstract": "ABSTRACT\r\n\r\nStatic and dynamic stability derivatives known as aero model are important numbers used in preliminary design of a vehicle and often used in engineering flight simulator. These measure how much change in forces and moments acting on the vehicle when there is a small change in flight condition parameters such as angle of attack, altitude and speed. Increasing the capability of computational fluid dynamics (CFD) method in solving complex unsteady flow around complex geometry, it can be used for determining dynamic stability derivatives of the vehicle which was often conducted in wind tunnel requiring higher cost and quite complex mechanism measurement device. The paper presents the determination of longitudinal static and dynamic stability derivatives of the designed UAV using computational fluid dynamics method and Fourier analysis. For obtaining dynamic stability derivatives, the UAV model have to move in either the single periodic vertical movement or single pitch rotation or in both combination of them with sines or cosines function. The unsteady flow solution around the moving vehicle are then obtained by solving Reynolds averaged navier-stokes equations. The results of unsteady aerodynamic forces and moments of the UAV are then analyzed using Fourier method to yield static and dynamic stability derivatives. Based on the results show that the designed UAV has good longitudinal dynamic stability agreement compared to vortex Lattice method. It fulfills the requirement for the UAV to have longitudinal stability in terms of pitching moment with the rate of angle of attack and pitch rate.",

      "abstract": "In the last decade, small and mirco unmanned aerial vehicles (MUAV) have become an increasing risk to security and safety in civilian and military scenarios. Further, countermeasures are hard to deploy due to the MUAV ability to operate with highly agile flight maneuver and the physical constrains due to very small cross-sections as well for RADAR as for LiDAR detection. The French-German Research Institute of Saint-Louis (ISL) is studying heterogeneous sensor networks for detection and identification of threats. Shortwave laser gated viewing is used to record images of the target and different image processing algorithms and filters are investigated to perform reliable tracking of MUAV flying in front of textured and clear sky backgrounds. Here, an analysis approach is presented to analyze the MUAV flight behavior and three-dimensional path from image data. Further, a prediction approach is presented to estimate the target position in near future.",

      "abstract": "Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) equipped with optical sensors are used more frequently in research aiming at solving numerous problems occurring in agriculture. Particularly noteworthy is the use of these devices to identify plant threats caused by pests. In addition, they are helpful in making decisions on the regulation of nutrient content in soil, irrigation of pastures and arable fields, and determining the date of crop harvesting and loses in yield. The examples cited in this publication indicate unquestionably the huge potential of integration of UAVs with optical sensors that record radiation in the optical range (350\u20133000 nm). Thermographic and fluorescent sensors are also very popular. In the near future, UAVs will play a key role in improving the profitability of agricultural production.\r\n\u00a0\r\nBezza\u0142ogowe statki powietrzne wyposa\u017cone w czujniki optyczne znajduj\u0105 coraz powszechniejsze zastosowanie w badaniach ukierunkowanych na rozwi\u0105zywanie licznych problem\u00f3w wyst\u0119puj\u0105cych w rolnictwie.

      "abstract": "In recent years, credit and debit cards have become a very convenient method of payment. The growing use of card payments, hereafter referred to as credit cards, is evident in the daily use with many applications, such as withdrawing money from an Automated Teller Machine (ATM) and making payments in a store. Online payment has been very common these days, where the transaction is made across a great distance, allowing for online shopping. This has increased chance of credit cards experiencing a risk of cybersecurity attacks, particularly if the transaction amount is big enough. Another problem that arises is the potential fraud should a thief try to impersonate the credit card owner\u00e2\u0080\u0099s identity. To overcome these obstacles, we propose a BioPay scheme that uses the fingerprint biotoken to replace the current plastic credit card. The BioPay scheme uses the biometric data (fingerprint), revocable fingerprint biotokens (Biotope), and Bipartite token to provide high authentication, non-repudiation, security and privacy for all payment transactions including money withdrawal from an ATM. The BioPay scheme collects biometric data (i.e. fingerprint) from users and embeds four-digit authentication numbers inside the encoding biometric data (i.e. fingerprint), finally distributing them over clouds. In the payment/withdrawal process, a user provides his/her fingerprint to complete the transaction. BioPay scheme insures that the transaction process performs on an encrypted form to provide security and privacy for the customer\u00e2\u0080\u0099s bank information. Our experiment shows that BioPay has comparable accuracy and significant performance gain for performing the transaction process.",

      "abstract": "<p>The prostate-specific membrane antigen (PSMA)\u2013targeted radiotracers <sup>68</sup>Ga/<sup>177</sup>Lu-PSMA-I&amp;T and <sup>99m</sup>Tc-PSMA-I&amp;S (for <b>i</b>maging and <b>s</b>urgery) are currently successfully used for clinical PET imaging, radionuclide therapy, and radioguided surgery of metastatic prostate cancer. To additionally exploit the high sensitivity and spatial resolution of fluorescence imaging for improved surgical guidance, a PSMA-I&amp;T\u2013based hybrid tracer, PSMA-I&amp;F (DOTAGA-k(Sulfo-Cy5)-y-nal-k-Sub-KuE), has been developed and evaluated. <b>Methods:</b> The in vitro PSMA-targeting efficiency of PSMA-I&amp;F, the reference PSMA-I&amp;T, and their corresponding <sup>nat</sup>Ga-/<sup>68</sup>Ga- and <sup>nat</sup>Lu/<sup>177</sup>Lu counterparts was determined in LNCaP cells via competitive binding assays (IC<sub>50</sub>) and dual-tracer radioligand and fluorescence internalization studies. Biodistribution and small-animal PET imaging studies were performed in CB17 SCID and LNCaP xenograft\u2013bearing SHO mice, respectively, and complemented by intraoperative far-red fluorescence imaging using a clinical laparoscope. Additionally, fully automated serial cryosectioning and fluorescence imaging of 1 tumor-bearing animal as well as PSMA immunohistochemistry and fluorescence microscopy of organ cryosections (tumor, kidney, spleen) were also performed. <b>Results:</b> Compared with the parent PSMA-I&amp;T analogs, the PSMA affinities of PSMA-I&amp;F and its <sup>nat</sup>Ga-/<sup>nat</sup>Lu-complexes remained high and unaffected by dye conjugation (7.9 &lt; IC<sub>50</sub> &lt; 10.5 nM for all ligands). The same was observed for the internalization of <sup>68</sup>Ga- and <sup>177</sup>Lu-PSMA-I&amp;F. In vivo, blood clearance of <sup>68</sup>Ga- and <sup>177</sup>Lu-PSMA-I&amp;F was only slightly delayed by high plasma protein binding (94%\u201395%), and very low accumulation in nontarget organs was observed already at 1 h after injection. Dynamic PET imaging confirmed PSMA-specific (as demonstrated by coinjection of 2-PMPA) uptake into the LNCaP xenograft (4.5% \u00b1 1.8 percentage injected dose per gram) and the kidneys (106% \u00b1 23 percentage injected dose per gram). Tumor-to-background ratios of 2.1, 5.2, 9.6, and 9.6 for blood, liver, intestines, and muscle, respectively, at 1 h after injection led to excellent imaging contrast in <sup>68</sup>Ga-PSMA-I&amp;F PET and in intraoperative fluorescence imaging. Furthermore, fluorescence imaging of tissue cryosections allowed high-resolution visualization of intraorgan PSMA-I&amp;F distribution in vivo and its correlation with PSMA expression as determined by immunohistochemistry. <b>Conclusion:</b> Thus, with its high PSMA-targeting efficiency and favorable pharmacokinetic profile, <sup>68</sup>Ga/<sup>177</sup>Lu-PSMA-I&amp;F serves as an excellent proof-of-concept compound for the general feasibility of PSMA-I&amp;T\u2013based hybrid imaging. The PSMA-I&amp;T scaffold represents a versatile PSMA-targeted lead structure, allowing relatively straightforward adaptation to the different structural requirements of dedicated nuclear or hybrid imaging agents.</p>",

      "abstract": "The manipulation of articulated objects is of primary importance in Robotics and can be considered as one of the most complex manipulation tasks. Traditionally, this problem has been tackled by developing ad hoc approaches, which lack flexibility and portability. In this paper, we present a framework based on answer set programming (ASP) for the automated manipulation of articulated objects in a robot control architecture. In particular, ASP is employed for representing the configuration of the articulated object for checking the consistency of such representation in the knowledge base and for generating the sequence of manipulation actions. The framework is exemplified and validated on the Baxter dual-arm manipulator in the first, simple scenario. Then, we extend such scenario to improve the overall setup accuracy and to introduce a few constraints in robot actions execution to enforce their feasibility. The extended scenario entails a high number of possible actions that can be fruitfully combined together. Therefore, we exploit macro actions from automated planning in order to provide more effective plans. We validate the overall framework in the extended scenario, thereby confirming the applicability of ASP also in more realistic Robotics settings and showing the usefulness of macro actions for the robot-based manipulation of articulated objects.",

First of all, we extend recent work on physically realizable adversarial examples to make them more robust to translation, rotation, and scale in real-world scenarios. Secondly, we demonstrate attacks against object detection neural networks rather than considering only the simpler problem of classification, demonstrating the ability to force these networks to mislocalize as well as misclassify. We demonstrate our method on multiple object detection frameworks, including Faster R-CNN, YOLO v3, and our own single-shot detection architecture.",

However, dead wood observation by Pine wilt disease is based on field survey. Therefore, it is difficult to observe large-scale forests due to physical and economic problems. In this paper, high resolution images were obtained using the unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) in the area where the pine wilt disease recurred. The damaged tree due to pine wilt disease was detected using Artificial Neural Network (ANN), Support Vector Machine (SVM) supervision classification technique. Also, the accuracy of supervised classification results was calculated. After conducting supervised classification on accessible forests, the reliability of the accuracy was verified by comparing the results of field surveys.",

      "abstract": "Head and neck cancer (HNC) includes cancers in the oral/nasal cavity, pharynx, larynx, etc., and it is the sixth most common cancer worldwide. The principal treatment is surgical removal where a complete tumor resection is crucial to reduce the recurrence and mortality rate. Intraoperative tumor imaging enables surgeons to objectively visualize the malignant lesion to maximize the tumor removal with healthy safe margins. Hyperspectral imaging (HSI) is an emerging imaging modality for cancer detection, which can augment surgical tumor inspection, currently limited to subjective visual inspection. In this paper, we aim to investigate HSI for automated cancer detection during image-guided surgery, because it can provide quantitative information about light interaction with biological tissues and exploit the potential for malignant tissue discrimination. The proposed solution forms a novel framework for automated tongue-cancer detection, explicitly exploiting HSI, which particularly uses the spectral variations in specific bands describing the cancerous tissue properties. The method follows a machine-learning based classification, employing linear support vector machine (SVM), and offers a superior sensitivity and a significant decrease in computation time. The model evaluation is on 7 <i>ex-vivo</i> specimens of squamous cell carcinoma of the tongue, with known histology. The HSI combined with the proposed classification reaches a sensitivity of 94%, specificity of 68% and area under the curve (AUC) of 92%. This feasibility study paves the way for introducing HSI as a non-invasive imaging aid for cancer detection and increase of the effectiveness of surgical oncology.",

      "abstract": "Multi-model techniques have shown an outstanding effectiveness in the cooperative task assignment and path planning of the unmanned combat aerial vehicle(UCAV) formation. With cooperative decision making and control, the cooperative combat of the UCAV formation are described and the mathematical model of the UCAV formation is built. Then, the task assignment model of the UCAV formation is developed according to flight characteristics of the UCAV formation and constraints in battlefield. The cooperative task assignment problem is solved using the improved particle swarm optimization(IPSO), ant colony algorithm(ACA) and genetic algorithm(GA) respectively. The comparative analysis is conducted in the aspects of the precision and the search speed. The path planning model of the UCAV formation is constructed considering the oil cost, threat cost, crash cost and time cost. The cooperative path planning problem is solved based on the evolution algorithm(EA), in which unique coding scheme of chromosomes is designed, and the crossover operator and mutation operator are redefined. Simulation results demonstrate that the UCAV formation can choose the best algorithm according to the real battlefield environment, which can solve the cooperative task assignment and path planning problems quickly and effectively to meet the demand of the cooperative combat.",

      "abstract": "Nowadays, ubiquitous network access has become a reality, thanks to Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) that have gained extreme popularity due to their flexible deployment and higher chance of line-of-sight links to ground users. Telecommunication service providers deploy UAVs to provide areal network access in remote rural areas, disaster-affected areas, or massive-attended events (sport venues, festivals, etc.), where full setup to provide temporary wireless coverage would be very expensive. Of course, a UAV is battery-powered with a limited energy budget for both mobility aspect and communication aspect. An efficient solution is to allow UAVs switching their radio modules to the sleep mode in order to extend the battery lifetime. This results in temporary unavailability of communication feature. Within such a situation, the ultimate deal for a UAV operator is to provide a cost-effective service with acceptable availability. This would allow meeting some target quality of service while having a good market share granting satisfactory benefits. In this article, we exhibit a new framework with many interesting insights into how to jointly define the availability and the access cost in UAV-empowered flying access networks to opportunistically cover a target geographical area. Yet, we construct a duopoly model to capture the adversarial behavior of service providers in terms of their pricing policies and their respective availability probabilities. Optimal periodic beaconing (advertising the presence of the UAV) is to be addressed, given the UAVs with limited battery capacity and their recharging constraints. A full analysis of the game, both in terms of equilibrium pricing and equilibrium availability, is derived. We show that the availability-pricing game exhibits some nice features as it is submodular with respect to the availability policy; whereas, it is supermodular with respect to the service fee. Furthermore, we implement a learning scheme using best response dynamics that allows operators to learn their joint pricing-availability strategies in a fast, accurate, and distributed fashion. Extensive simulations show convergence of the proposed scheme to the joint pricing-availability equilibrium and offer promising insights into how the game parameters should be chosen to efficiently control the duopoly game.",

      "abstract": "Detection of landmines at modest distances from a moving vehicle is desired to help protect soldiers from explosive threats. The US Department of Defense developed a sensor system to observe seismic vibration patterns that lead to detection of buried objects in unpaved roads. The system is capable of exciting soil acoustically and observing seismic responses while advancing at 1m/s with a 30m standoff. The optical design and build created 960 simultaneous independent spatial observations that collect data over a 0.5m x 1m area. A gimbal then repositions the sensor to collect a new region. In this sequential manner the system can scan 2m x 1km in less than 30min. Active gimbal stabilization kept beam positions relatively stable on the ground while the vehicle was in motion. Inertial sensing reduced gross Doppler components common to all channels. Even with these corrections, channel dropouts remained a challenge, so filtering of erroneous samples in time and space was required to improve the data quality. Automated target recognition algorithms quickly process the spatial vibration data to warn operators of a threat. We present here an overview of the system and collected data. The system proved effective at finding buried threats that produced seismic anomalies at the surface, but additional challenges lie in differentiating target responses from clutter. The seismic response of naturally occurring environmental clutter in roads produces responses that appear similar to objects of interest, reducing the effectiveness of target detection algorithms.",

      "abstract": "Point clouds captured from Unmanned Aerial Systems are increasingly relied upon to provide information describing the structure of forests. The quality of the information derived from these point clouds is dependent on a range of variables, including the type and structure of the forest, weather conditions and flying parameters. A key requirement to achieve accurate estimates of height based metrics describing forest structure is a source of ground information. This study explores the availability and reliability of ground surface points available within point clouds captured in six forests of different structure (canopy cover and height), using three image capture and processing strategies, consisting of nadir, oblique and composite nadir/oblique image networks. The ground information was extracted through manual segmentation of the point clouds as well as through the use of two commonly used ground filters, LAStools lasground and the Cloth Simulation Filter. The outcomes of these strategies were assessed against ground control captured with a Total Station. Results indicate that a small increase in the number of ground points captured (between 0 and 5% of a 10 m radius plot) can be achieved through the use of a composite image network. In the case of manually identified ground points, this reduced the root mean square error (RMSE) error of the terrain model by between 1 and 11 cm, with greater reductions seen in plots with high canopy cover. The ground filters trialled were not able to exploit the extra information in the point clouds and inconsistent results in terrain RMSE were obtained across the various plots and imaging network configurations. The use of a composite network also provided greater penetration into the canopy, which is likely to improve the representation of mid-canopy elements.",

      "abstract": "Detecting and tracking moving objects (DATMO) is an essential component for autonomous driving and transportation. In this paper, we present a computationally low-cost and robust DATMO system which uses as input only 2D laser rangefinder (LRF) information. Due to its low requirements both in sensor needs and computation, our DATMO algorithm is meant to be used in current Autonomous Guided Vehicles (AGVs) to improve their reliability for the cargo transportation tasks at port terminals, advancing towards the next generation of fully autonomous transportation vehicles. Our method follows a Detection plus Tracking paradigm. In the detection step we exploit the minimum information of 2D-LRFs by segmenting the elements of the scene in a model-free way and performing a fast object matching to pair segmented elements from two different scans. In this way, we easily recognize dynamic objects and thus reduce consistently by between two and five times the computational burden of the adjacent tracking method. We track the final dynamic objects with an improved Multiple-Hypothesis Tracking (MHT), to which special functions for filtering, confirming, holding, and deleting targets have been included. The full system is evaluated in simulated and real scenarios producing solid results. Specifically, a simulated port environment has been developed to gather realistic data of common autonomous transportation situations such as observing an intersection, joining vehicle platoons, and perceiving overtaking maneuvers. We use different sensor configurations to demonstrate the robustness and adaptability of our approach. We additionally evaluate our system with real data collected in a port terminal the Netherlands. We show that it is able to accomplish the vehicle following task successfully, obtaining a total system recall of more than 98% while running faster than 30 Hz.",

      "abstract": "Path planning of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) in threatening and adversarial areas is a constrained nonlinear optimal problem which takes a great amount of static and dynamic constraints into account. Quantum-behaved pigeon-inspired optimization (QPIO) has been widely applied to such nonlinear problems. However, conventional QPIO is suffering low global convergence speed and local optimum. In order to solve the above problems, an improved QPIO algorithm, adaptive operator QPIO, is proposed in this paper. Firstly, a new initialization process based on logistic mapping method is introduced to generate the initial population of the pigeon-swarm. After that, to improve the performance of the map and compass operation, the factor parameter will be adaptively updated in each iteration, which can balance the ability between global and local search. In the final landmark operation, the gradual decreasing pigeon population-updating strategy is introduced to prevent premature convergence and local optimum. Finally, the demonstration of the proposed algorithm on UAV path planning problem is presented, and the comparison result indicates that the performance of our algorithm is better than that of particle swarm optimization (PSO), pigeon-inspired optimization (PIO), and its variants, in terms of convergence and accuracy.",

      "abstract": "Robot introspection is expected to greatly aid longer-term autonomy of autonomous manipulation systems. By equipping robots with abilities that allow them to assess the quality of their sensory data, robots can detect and classify anomalies and recover appropriately from common anomalies. This work builds on our previous Sense-Plan-Act-Introspect-Recover (SPAIR) system. We introduce an improved anomaly detector that exploits latent states to monitor anomaly occurrence when robots collaborate with humans in shared workspaces, but also present a multiclass classifier that is activated with anomaly detection. Both implementations are derived from Bayesian non-parametric methods with strong modeling capabilities for learning and inference of multivariate time series with complex and uncertain behavior patterns. In particular, we explore the use of a hierarchical Dirichlet stochastic process prior to learning a Hidden Markov Model (HMM) with a switching vector auto-regressive observation model (sHDP-VAR-HMM). The detector uses a dynamic log-likelihood threshold that varies by latent state for anomaly detection and the anomaly classifier is implemented by calculating the cumulative log-likelihood of testing observation based on trained models. The purpose of our work is to equip the robot with anomaly detection and anomaly classification for the full set of skills associated with a given manipulation task. We consider a human\u2013robot cooperation task to verify our work and measure the robustness and accuracy of each skill. Our improved detector succeeded in detecting 136 common anomalies and 368 nominal executions with a total accuracy of 91.0%. An overall anomaly classification accuracy of 97.1% is derived by performing the anomaly classification on an anomaly dataset that consists of 7 kinds of detected anomalies from a total of 136 anomalies samples.",

      "abstract": "Herbaceous crop yield intensification creates favourable conditions for the development of pests that intensify the attack of soil pathogens traditionally controlled by disinfectant, which are mostly prohibited and unlisted because of their toxicity. The use of grafted plants solves this problem and assists in addressing abiotic stress conditions. Within Solanaceae, specifically tomato crops (Solanum lycopersicum), the use of the splicing technique (simple and easily automated) is of special interest. This experiment attempts to present the combined influence of cutting angle and different random diameters on grafting success with the objective of detecting an optimum working range that will be applicable to automated and robotic grafting systems. An increase in the grafting angle is associated with a higher survival of grafted plants despite variations in diameter. Moreover, a threshold cutting angle is observed from which the success rate no longer increases but decreases drastically. Therefore, for a given working range with a significant cutting angle, whether the seedlings of origin are similar in diameter is not important, and this factor is more influential outside the optimal cutting angle range.",

      "abstract": "Surveying of woody debris left over from harvesting operations on managed forests is an important step in monitoring site quality, managing the extraction of residues and reconciling differences in pre-harvest inventories and actual timber yields. Traditional methods for post-harvest survey involving manual assessment of debris on the ground over small sample plots are labor-intensive, time-consuming, and do not scale well to heterogeneous landscapes. In this paper, we propose and evaluate new automated methods for the collection and interpretation of high-resolution, Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV)-borne imagery over post-harvested forests for estimating quantities of fine and coarse woody debris. Using high-resolution, geo-registered color mosaics generated from UAV-borne images, we develop manual and automated processing methods for detecting, segmenting and counting both fine and coarse woody debris, including tree stumps, exploiting state-of-the-art machine learning and image processing techniques. Results are presented using imagery over a post-harvested compartment in a Pinus radiata plantation and demonstrate the capacity for both manual image annotations and automated image processing to accurately detect and quantify coarse woody debris and stumps left over after harvest, providing a cost-effective and scalable survey method for forest managers.",

      "abstract": "Micro unmanned aerial vehicles (MUAV) have become increasingly popular during the last decade due to their access to a wide consumer market. With the increasing number of MUAV, the unintended and intended misuse by flying close to sensitive areas has risen as a potentially increasing risk. To counter this threat, surveillance systems are under development which will monitor the MUAV flight behavior. In this context, the reliable tracking and prediction of the MUAV flight behavior is crucial to increase the performance of countermeasures. In this paper, we discuss electro-optical computational imaging methods with a focus on the ability to perform a tracking of the three dimensional (3D) flight path. We evaluate the analysis of different imaging methods performed with active laser detection as well as with passive imaging using advanced scenario analysis. In first experimental investigation, we recorded and analyzed image sequences of a MUAV quad-copter flying at low altitude in laboratory and in outdoor scenario. Our results show, that we are able to track the three dimensional flight path with high accuracy and we are able to give a reliable prediction of the MUAV flight behavior within the near future.",

      "abstract": "Today, unmanned aerial systems (UAS) are being used for a growing range of useful applications. This has been drastically increased during the last few years. The market is growing and a wide range of affordable and capable products is available. However, also the misuse of such systems is growing and has become a big problem for public security, private areas and industrial facilities. Therefore, products for detection, classification and countermeasures are an upcoming market though a complete solution is not yet present. At the Fraunhofer IOSB, a research project has been set up in 2017 with its aim to develop an interactive detection and analyzing tool that helps the security staff in situation analysis and decision making during the handling of threatening situations caused by the misuse of drones. Beginning with different measuring devices and data fusion of these channels in order to generate a situational picture the systems handle a comprehensive risk management while calculating the chances of countermeasures. The user is supported by situational awareness tools and simulation/prognosis of possible scenarios during the complete process. The objective is the optimal cognition for the users and to assist during the solution finding. There is no automatic decision and no automatic reaction without humans in the decision loop.",

      "abstract": "Newly evolving threats to public safety and security, related to attacks in public spaces, are catching the attention of both law enforcement and the general public. Such threats range from the emotional misbehaviour of sports fans in sports venues to well-planned terrorist attacks. Moreover, tools are needed to assist in the search for wanted persons. Static solutions, such as closed circuit television (CCTV), exist, but there is a need for a highly-portable, on-demand solution. Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) have evolved drastically over the past decade. Developments are observed not only with regards to flight mechanisms and extended flight times but also in the imaging and image stabilization capabilities. Although different methods for facial recognition have existed for some time, dealing with imaging from a moving source to detect the faces in the crowd and compare them to an existing face database is a scientific problem that requires a complex solution. This paper deals with real-time face recognition in the crowd using unmanned aerial vehicles. Face recognition was performed using OpenCV and Dlib libraries.",

      "abstract": "Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) have broad application potential for the Internet of Things (IoT) due to their small size, low cost, and flexible control. At present, the main positioning method for UAVs is the use of GPS. However, GPS positioning may be affected by stronger electromagnetic signals from spoofing attacks. In this study, a radar-assisted positioning method based on 5G millimeter waves is proposed. In 5G end-to-end network slices, the rotors of UAVs can be detected and identified by deploying 5G millimeter wave radar. High-resolution range profile (HRRP) is used to obtain the UAV location in the detection zone. Micro-Doppler characteristics are used to identify the UAVs and the cepstrum method is used to extract the number and speed information of the UAV rotor. The sinusoidal frequency modulation (SFM) parameter optimization method is used to separate multiple UAVs. The proposed method provides information on the number of UAVs, the position of the UAV, the number of rotors, and the rotation speed of each rotor. The simulation results show that the proposed radar detection method is well suited for UAV detection and identification and provides a valid GPS-independent method for UAV tracking.",

      "abstract": "Providing advanced healthcare to the warfighters in the battlefield has proven challenging due to the difficult environmental conditions and geographical separation between the injured warrior and healthcare providers. The introduction of Cyber Medicine enables physicians and soldiers to utilize technologies including mobile apps, robotics, connectivity to wired/wireless networks, satellites, clouds, HPCs, and software to identify, assess and treat the injured. However, what happens when the adversary attacks the cyber domain in addition to the physical domain? The answer could be that all automated systems will become suspect whether they are embedded systems, information processing systems, diagnosis and triage systems, or remote surgical robotics. This analysis identifies areas where the intelligent Cyber-Medical System can provide better healthcare to the battlefield including services to the disadvantaged soldier at the edge. Architecting intelligent systems starts with learning the desired system operation, sifting through historical data and procedure outcomes, assessing vulnerabilities, then delivering systems that mimics and augment human performance to solve problems. The battlefield Cybermedicine has the challenge of increased cyber security risks due to the need to be deployed in hostile environment, and the challenge of dealing with injuries that are unique to the battlefield. Moreover, the viability of intelligent automation depends on reliable connectivity and availability of reliable data and infrastructure, while the battlefield lacks both those conditions. The goal of this study is to deliver medical services and alleviate the vulnerability impacts through more secure design, development, deployment, maintenance, and operations. Additionally, this paper introduces new cybermedicine concepts and architectures that benefit from the various types of Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence to build Cyber-Medical System that can resist corruption from unauthenticated users/data, and from active malware and physical media attacks.",

      "abstract": "Emerging autonomous driving applications are setting the pace of the innovation for the on board GNSS receiver. Position accuracy, high availability, robustness of operation and formal integrity of the observables are the priorities, which are giving rise and shaping a new class of automotive receiver components and architectures. Moreover, because the autonomous driving and ADAS are safety critical, on top of previous requirements there is also the requirement for Functional Safety (informally called FuSa) compliancy. The documents codifying Functional Safety for automotive are the ISO26262 part 1 to part 11. The ISO26262 complements the well-known reliability automotive standard AEC-Q100. With respect to FuSa, a system can be defined as functionally safe if it always operates correctly and predictably. More importantly, in the event of failures, the system must remain safe for persons. Lastly also security is becoming a paramount and a new standard for cybersecurity in automotive, the ISO/SAE 21434, is in development where for a GNSS receiver this means robustness versus jamming, spoofing and meaconing attacks. This contribution introduces the functional safety and the security aspects of the new STMicroelectronics TeseoAPP (STA9100) GNSS receiver chipset.",

      "abstract": "In recent years advances in machine learning methods such as deep learning has led to significant improvements in our ability to track people and vehicles, and to recognise specific individuals. Such technology has enormous potential to enhance the performance of image-based security systems. However, wide-spread use of such technology has important legal and ethical implications, not least for individuals right to privacy. In this paper, we describe a technological approach to balance the two competing goals of system efficacy and privacy. We describe a methodology for constructing a \u201cgoal-function\u201d that reflects the operators preferences for detection performance and anonymity. This goal function is combined with an image-processing system that provides tracking and threat assessment functionality and a decision-making framework that assesses the potential value gained by providing the operator with de-anonymized images. The framework provides a probabilistic approach combining user preferences, world state model, possible user actions and threat mitigation effectiveness, and suggests the user action with the largest estimated utility. We show results of operating the system in a perimeter-protection scenario",

      "abstract": "In October 2018, NATO SET-249 performed a common trial at WTD 52, Oberjettenberg, Germany, to study laser dazzle effects in an airborne scenario. The facility is equipped with a cable car and is ideal for slanted path experiments from the base station to the cable car where the sensors were mounted. NATO SET-249\u2019s background is laser threat evaluation and the evaluation of the impact of laser eye dazzle on the visual performance of humans. This work gives an overview on the various measurements performed here: 1. Assessment of dazzle effects originating from light scattering at an aircraft canopy by comparing the images of two cameras: one outside and one inside the canopy. The general findings showed that the canopy, which had been used previously on an aircraft, substantially affected the dazzle pattern in the camera within the canopy as compared to the camera outside. 2. Sensor dazzling: Laser dazzling of complementary metal-oxide-semiconductor (CMOS) cameras in the visible domain and, in addition, laser dazzling of a camera equipped with a fisheye lens, which is commonly present in micro-unmanned aerial vehicles, is demonstrated. The dazzled area in the camera field of view (FoV) grows with increasing laser irradiance, and dazzling is effective at irradiance levels around a few \u03bcW/cm\u00b2. 3. An overview on realistic handheld laser engagement scenarios to test the capabilities of a DSTL-developed Laser Event Recorder (LER) is provided. This technology is able to detect continuous wave (CW) and pulsed lasers, and extract their wavelengths, irradiances, Pulse Repetition Frequency (PRF) and directionality. Applications for this LER include collecting information on aircraft laser exposure events, giving information to assess if engagements are eye safe. 4. Measurements performed on various Fraunhofer IOSB developed sensor systems hardened against laser dazzle: The hardening measure of these systems is based either on the use of spatial light modulators or on the implementation of the principle of complementary wavelength bands. The field trial offered the possibility to generate data of the hardened systems under real life conditions.",

      "abstract": "Self-sensing cements offer a unique opportunity to unify our approach to the remote monitoring and maintenance of concrete assets. The objective of this work is to develop a remotely-deployable, \u00e2\u20ac\u0153smart cement\u00e2\u20ac\u009d technology that can simultaneously repair damage, monitor underlying structural strain and attempt to detect further defects. Automating the deployment of these materials using robotics will improve the efficiency of installation and permit application to areas with restricted access or hazardous environments. Here, we present our latest progress in manufacturing and robotically spraycoating smart cement sensor-repairs onto concrete substrates. Spray-coating provides controllable, high pressure distribution of the material, providing high geometrical accuracy in addition to high adhesion. The smart cements are based on metakaolin geopolymers \u00e2\u20ac\u201d a novel class of cement-like binders that cure to a strong, chemically resistant, electrically conductive shell. In this work, the manufacturing process of the geopolymer patch is presented before investigating the sensing capability. Initial results regarding the temperature and strain sensing of the patch demonstrate the dependence of measurements on the frequency of the applied potential. Furthermore, exploiting this dependence presents the possibility of self-compensating for temperature.",

      "abstract": "Dedicated antenna arrays and spatial signal processing techniques are the most effective countermeasures against radio interference or sophisticated spoofing attacks. Especially in the field of Global Navigation Satellite Systems (GNSS) their incorporation has recently raised attention as they allow to recognize a spoofy GNSS signal through a comparison of its spatial information measured at the antenna elements of the array with the decoded information from the satellite ephemeris data. If they do not match, the spoofer can be mitigated by pointing a null in its direction. For that purpose, the attitude of the array in the coordinate system of the ephemeris data is required to be known. Especially in the field of automated and connected driving driving, both aforementioned types of disturbances have to be detected and mitigated to ensure a continuously safe and reliable operation. Therefore, compact antenna arrays, such as conventional uniform rectangular arrays (URA), where the distance between adjacent antenna elements does not exceed half a carrier wavelength, are commonly used. A significant drawback is posed by the large size of such arrays, which impedes the installation in the consumer automotive area, where an aesthetic design is a unique selling point and hence strictly followed by industry. This paper emphasizes a new approach, where the conventional URA is split into uniform linear arrays (ULA), whose size allow for a hidden installation in the front and rear bumper of a car, which would otherwise not provide enough space for the entire large URA. Thereby the new array violates two assumptions, which are valid for compact arrays: The distance between adjacent antennas can reach up to the length of the car, resulting in spacings of 20 \u2013 30 carrier wavelengths. Furthermore, the metallic car body, which carries and affects the array, has a severe impact on the received signal power levels, which can no longer be assumed to be equal at all antenna elements. There are mainly two established methods for GNSS-based attitude determination: On the one hand, there are methods developed for and tested on compact arrays, whose operation has not been tested on configurations as the proposed array, where the aforementioned assumptions are violated. On the other hand, there are real time kintematic (RTK) based approaches, which are utilizing double-differences of phase measurements from distributed GNSS receivers, which instead lack the possibility to mitigate interferences. Therefore, this paper presents an approach to determine the attitude of the newly proposed spatially distributed array, thereby providing the ability to use spatial signal processing techniques for interference mitigation and hence providing robustness in degraded environments. The accuracy of the algorithm is tested in a realistic scenario using a measurement of the manifold of the proposed array configuration mounted onto a car.",

      "abstract": "Recent advances in Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) have attracted great attention in remote sensing due to their high capability to model high-level semantic content of Remote Sensing (RS) images. However, CNNs do not explicitly retain the relative position of objects in an image and, thus, the effectiveness of the obtained features is limited in the framework of the complex object detection problems. To address this problem, in this paper we introduce Capsule Networks (CapsNets) for object detection in Unmanned Aerial Vehicle-acquired images. Unlike CNNs, CapsNets extract and exploit the information content about objects\u2019 relative position across several layers, which enables parsing crowded scenes with overlapping objects. Experimental results obtained on two datasets for car and solar panel detection problems show that CapsNets provide similar object detection accuracies when compared to state-of-the-art deep models with significantly reduced computational time. This is due to the fact that CapsNets emphasize dynamic routine instead of the depth.",

      "abstract": "<p><strong class=\"journal-contentHeaderColor\">Abstract.</strong> Despite the high standard guaranteed by 3D scanning technology, image based modeling establishes the most widely used technique for surface reconstruction, being a cheaper and more portable approach. The strong increase in the use of Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs), is increasingly affirming and consolidating over the years. Being more cheap and portable than the active sensors approach, the combination of photogrammetry and drones is widely used for different applications both for large scale mapping and for documentation of architecture and archaeological heritage. UAV based photogrammetry allows for rapid accurate mapping and three-dimensional modelling. Over the last two decades, the study of archaeological sites have benefited from the constant evolution of sensor-based surveying techniques, finding effective application for purely visualization purposes or for the extraction of metric data. The Punic-Roman temple \"Sardus Pater Babai\" in southern Sardinia (Italy), has been the subject of a massive anastylosis. The close-range photogrammetry technique, exploiting the images produced by a UAV consumer and the GNSS system data, has allowed the creation of metrically correct 2D and 3D models useful also for an effective visualization of the information. A series of ortho-images has been extracted in order to represent plan, elevations and cross-sections of the monument.</p>",

      "abstract": "While key negotiation schemes, such as those based on Diffie&#x2013;Hellman, have been the subject of ongoing research, designing an efficient and security scheme remains challenging. In this paper, we propose a novel key negotiation scheme based on blockchain, which can be deployed in blockchain-enabled contexts such as data sharing or facilitating electric transactions between vehicles (e.g., unmanned vehicles). We propose three candidates for flexible selection, namely, key exchanges via transaction currency values through value channels (such as the amount in transactions), automated key exchanges through static scripts,and dynamic scripts, which can not only guarantee key availability with timeliness but also defend against MITM (man-in-the-middle) attacks, packet-dropping attacks, and decryption failure attacks.",

      "abstract": "In recent years, we have witnessed a substantial increase in the interest in maritime mining in the world, which has resulted in the development of many new methods for the exploitation of marine deposits as well as transport of spoil from the seabed to the surface (Karlic, 1984, Depowski, Kotli\u0144ski, R\u00fchle, Szamalek, 1998, Abramowski and Kotli\u0144ski, 2011, SPC, 2013, Royal Society, 2017, Sharma, 2017, Jones et al, 2019, Websites: JOGMEC, Nautilus Minerals, Atlantis II Deep, Bluenodules). In their research, the authors have been working on the development of a new concept of transport from the seabed.\n                     The authors have already presented the concept of the principle of operation of an autonomous transport module for transport from the seabed (Filipek and Broda, 2016, 2017, 2018). They designed and constructed a laboratory stand and carried out experiments, the results of which confirmed the applicability of the concept discussed in transport from the seabed. The research also included the determination of the energy source in the transport process and the changes in the average density of the transport module. Three transport concepts from the seabed were also compared in terms of their energy demand. In the next step, the authors addressed the issues of stability of the transport module in the process of immersion and ascent.\n                     In the course of these studies, there appeared the necessity of the theoretical examination of mass transfer between the transport module and the environment, which is the subject of this publication. The in-depth analysis of this issue is essential from the point of view of the practical suitability of the module for transporting from the seabed because the course of mass exchange between the transport module and the environment determines the speed of immersion and ascent.",

Nowadays DTMs and DSMs can be easily obtained by image-based matching using low altitude aerial dataset acquired from a digital camera by means of a lifting device. In recent years, the spread of commercial multi-rotor unmanned aerial vehicles and their decreasing cost made low-altitude aerial photography even easier than before, where balloons, kites and telescopic masts would have been used instead. However, the use of drones is often forbidden by law, especially in the archaeological areas, and therefore a more traditional approach must to be adopted instead.</p><p>This paper presents two different approaches adopted on the field to acquire the DTM of an archaeological excavation: the use of a pole held by a chest harness to lift a camera up to 3.5&thinsp;m height fitted with a 20&thinsp;mm wide angle lens; and a second solution that exploits ground-based fisheye photogrammetry. In general, an image network acquired from ground level is challenging due to: i) the poor coverage that can be obtained on the ground, ii) the large number of images that are required to cover large areas and consequently iii) the longer elaboration time that is required to process the data. The fisheye approach, however, proved to be more effective thanks to the more robust image network resulting both from the wider field of view and from the possibility to handle large datasets by downsampling the images and still retrieving strong key points. The main difference with the first system is that the monotonous images acquired by the 20&thinsp;mm lens, very plain in texture, require working at full resolution in order to distinguish valid features in the sand.</p><p>The final product of the tests carried out along this line in 2019 at Saqqara (Egypt) is a comprehensive DSM of the entire archaeological site with an accuracy of ~3&thinsp;cm.</p>",

      "abstract": "Nowadays, there is wide spectrum of areas of use of small unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV, drones). Their low cost, flexibility of use, low service cost and independence on infrastructure make them ideal carriers of different cargo. This fact brings many significant safety risk and threats. Especially aerial survey, flight zones disruptions and transport dangerous cargo. Above mentioned threat can be eliminated by: disabling navigation and control features, taking control over the steering and object destruction. One of the possible typically military solutions of that situation, is destruction by shooting. The most common way of solving the above task, is the use of barrel weapons of individual shooter or small military units. Therefore, we focused our effort on preventing the UAV mission accomplishing by its shooting destruction. To accomplish the task, in addition to detection and identification, we consider the distance determination as a fundamental problem. For the purposes of this paper, the distance determination we consider as a \u201clocalization\u201d. Comparison of UAV localization options is the issue of this paper. Two localizations methods have been defined. Localization option include active method (ILR \u2013 impulse laser rangefinder) and passive method (triangulation method). Using mathematical modelling we proved, that ILR measurement is possible. To determine a distance with a defined probability we designed specific measurement frequency. For a predetermined type of UAV and ILR we identified the maximum distance that can be measured. In the second part of this paper, we analyzed the accuracy of localization using the triangulation method. The accuracy of localization using this method is dependent on the squared of the UAV distance. There are two significant advantage of this method: measurements can be made continuously and multiple objects in the field of view can be measured at the same time. This article is part of a planned publishing activity dealing with the issue",

      "abstract": "Spoofing will seriously threaten the application of global navigation satellite system (GNSS) like autonomous vehicle. A research spoofing generator will contribute to assess the threat of spoofing attack and help the anti-spoofing research. But the recent commercial of the shelf (COTS) spoofing generator are expensive and the technology implementation is sophisticated and complicated. To address the above problem and promote the GNSS safety-critical applications, a spoofing generator using vector tracking-based software-defined receiver is proposed in this paper. The spoofing generator aims to modify the raw signals by cancelling the actual signal. The connections between the spreading code and carrier and the states of the victim/spoofed receiver are established through vector-tracking. The actual signal can be predicted effectively and the spoofing signal will be generated at the same time. The experiment test results show that the spoofing attack signal can mislead the victim receiver to the designed trajectory effectively. Neither the tracking channels nor the positioning observations has abnormal changes during this processing period. The recent anti-spoofing methods cannot detect this internal spoofing easily. The proposed spoofing generator can cover all open-sky satellites with a good quality of concealment. With the superiority of programmability and diversity, it is believed that the proposed spoofing generator method based on an open source software-defined receiver with vector tracking architecture has a great value for GNSS anti-spoofing researches.",

      "abstract": "We have previously reported that a subset of cancers is defined by global transcriptional deregulations with widespread deficiencies in mRNA transcription elongation (TE)\u2014we call such cancers as TEdeff. Notably, TEdeff cancers are characterized by spurious transcription and faulty mRNA processing in a large set of genes, such as interferon/JAK/STAT and TNF/NF-\u03baB pathways, leading to their suppression. The TEdeff subtype of tumors in renal cell carcinoma and metastatic melanoma patients significantly correlate with poor response and outcome in immunotherapy. Given the importance of investigating TEdeff cancers\u2014as it portends a significant roadblock against immunotherapy\u2014the goal of this protocol is to establish an in vitro TEdeff mouse model to study these widespread, non-genetic transcriptional abnormalities in cancers and gain new insights, novel uses for existing drugs, or find new strategies against such cancers. We detail the use of chronic flavopiridol mediated CDK9 inhibition to abrogate phosphorylation of serine 2 residue on the C-terminal repeat domain (CTD) of RNA polymerase II (RNA Pol II), suppressing the release of RNA Pol II into productive transcription elongation. Given that TEdeff cancers are not classified under any specific somatic mutation, a pharmacological model is advantageous, and best mimics the widespread transcriptional and epigenetic defects observed in them. The use of an optimized sublethal dose of flavopiridol is the only efficacious strategy in creating a generalizable model of non-genetic widespread disruption in transcription elongation and mRNA processing defects, closely mimicking the clinically observed TEdeff characteristics. Therefore, this model of TEdeff can be leveraged to dissect, cell-autonomous factors enabling them in resisting immune-mediated cell attack.",

      "abstract": "Morphing structures suitable for unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) have been investigated for several years. This paper presents a novel lightweight, morphing concept based on the exploitation of the \u201clever effect\u201d of a bistable composite plate that can be integrated in an UAV horizontal tail. Flight dynamics equations are solved in Simulink environment, thus being able to simulate and compare different flight conditions with conventional and bistable command surfaces. Subsequently, bistable plates are built by using composite materials, paying particular attention to dimensions, asymmetric stacking sequence and total thickness needed to achieve bistability. NACA0011 airfoil is chosen for proving this concept. Wind tunnel tests demonstrate that the discrete surface is capable of withstanding the aerodynamic pressure. A remotely piloted vehicle is employed to test the discrete horizontal tail command during the take-off. The results show that, choosing a proper configuration of constraints, stacking sequence and aspect ratio for the bistable laminate, it is possible to tailor the snap-through mechanism. The proposed concept appears lighter and increases aerodynamic efficiency when compared to conventional UAV command surfaces.",

      "abstract": "In recent years, GNSS-based cooperative positioning applications such as multiple unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), multiple unmanned surface vehicles (USVs), and intelligent transportation systems (ITSs) are receiving a great attention. These applications can achieve the information exchange among wireless devices (nodes). As multiple devices equipped with GNSS receivers are feasible to measure the distance and communicate with each other, the positioning performance of a single device can be enhanced greatly by using redundant measurements. Up to now, the focus of GNSS-based cooperative positioning applications is to provide users with high positioning accuracy and availability. Meanwhile, there is also an increasing demand for the integrity of GNSS-based cooperative positioning applications. Compared with conventional GNSS applications, cooperative positioning applications are more vulnerable to the interferences or attacks from the ground. For a cooperative positioning system, the faults occurring at one device could also affect other devices, further resulting in severe positioning errors of each node. Receiver autonomous integrity monitoring (RAIM), as a prevalent integrity monitoring method, has shown good performance on detecting and excluding the faults related with satellites. However, some challenges have to be tackled for applying RAIM to GNSS-based cooperative positioning applications including the definition, detection, and exclusion of new fault modes. Therefore, it is necessary to analyze the potential faults modes and design an effective RAIM algorithm for cooperative positioning system. In our research, the fault modes related with nodes are firstly introduced. A whole-network extended Kalman filter (WNEKF) is then proposed to integrate the pseudorange measurements of satellites and the ranging measurements between the nodes. Based on solution separation strategy, an integrity monitoring algorithm is developed to detect and exclude the faults. The benefit of our method is that it is conductive to monitor all the faults of the whole network simultaneously. Besides, based on the centralized algorithm, only few master nodes are needed to execute the integrity monitoring algorithm, while the other nodes receive integrity information from the master nodes.",

      "abstract": "Intelligent robotic autonomous systems (unmanned aerial/ground/surface/underwater vehicles) are attractive for military application to relieve humans from tedious or dangerous tasks. These systems require awareness of the environment and their own performance to reach a mission goal. This awareness enables them to adapt their operations to handle unexpected changes in the environment and uncertainty in assessments. Components of the autonomous system cannot rely on perfect awareness or actuator execution, and mistakes of one component can affect the entire system. To obtain a robust system, a system-wide approach is needed and a realistic model of all aspects of the system and its environment. In this paper, we present our study on the design and development of a fully functional autonomous system, consisting of sensors, observation processing and behavior analysis, information database, knowledge base, communication, planning processes, and actuators. The system behaves as a teammate of a human operator and can perform tasks independently with minimal interaction. The system keeps the human informed about relevant developments that may require human assistance, and the human can always redirect the system with high-level instructions. The communication behavior is implemented as a Social AI Layer (SAIL). The autonomous system was tested in a simulation environment to support rapid prototyping and evaluation. The simulation is based on the Robotic Operating System (ROS) with fully modelled sensors and actuators and the 3D graphics-enabled physics simulation software Gazebo. In this simulation, various flying and driving autonomous systems can execute their tasks in a realistic 3D environment with scripted or user-controlled threats. The results show the performance of autonomous operation as well as interaction with humans.",

      "abstract": "A method for improving the integrity monitoring measure of Global Positioning System (GPS) by exploiting terrestrial signals of opportunity (SOPs) is developed. The proposed method considers a receiver mounted on an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV), which makes pseudorange observations on GPS satellites and terrestrial SOPs. First, SOP pseudorange measurement errors are characterized from an extensive data collected with a UAV in different environments: open sky, semi-urban, and urban. Next, the vertical protection level (VPL) reduction by exploiting terrestrial SOPs is studied. It is demonstrated that adding terrestrial SOP measurements, which are inherently at low elevation angles is more effective to reduce VPL over adding GPS measurements. Experimental results to evaluate the developed method are presented for a UAV navigating in an urban environment over a trajectory of 823 m, while collecting GPS signals and cellular real long-term evolution (LTE) SOPs. It is demonstrated that the proposed method reduces the VPL by 57.76% from the VPL of GPS-only.",

      "abstract": "In this paper, we derive new satellite orbit and clock error models for time sequential, dual frequency, multi-constellation Advanced Receiver Autonomous Integrity Monitoring (ARAIM). In the current implementation of baseline \u2018snapshot\u2019 ARAIM, Carrier Smoothed Code (CSC) measurements at one instant in time are used to provide a navigation solution. Using a time-sequential implementation of ARAIM, i.e., using measurements collected over time, will significantly reduce Protection Levels (PL). It was shown in [3] that snapshot ARAIM cannot provide better performance than LPV-200, which has a 35 m Alert Limit (AL). Exploiting satellite motion will lead to superior positioning performance and significantly tighter PLs relative to baseline snapshot ARAIM, possibly even achieving 10 m ALs to support Category II aircraft approaches. In order to implement this time sequential approach, orbit and clock errors need to be characterized over time. In this paper, we process GPS and Galileo orbit and clock data to evaluate and analyze ranging errors over time. We then determine upper and lower bounds on ranging errors autocorrelation functions. These bounds will be implemented to over-bound time-sequential positioning errors.",

The mangrove ecosystem has very high economic and ecological functions if it is developed and preserved properly. Nowadays, many mangrove ecosystems are threatened by human activities. It is necessary to preserve and to develop the mangrove ecosystems to avoid the impact of human activity and to increase their usefulness. In the process of developing the mangrove ecosystems, detailed data are required to provide a comprehensive overview of the environmental and physical conditions of the mangrove ecosystems. The study aims at identifying and making the inventory of the existing condition of the mangrove ecosystems related to mangrove cover and biodiversity. The data are collected using aerial photography and UAVs, observation and field measurement. The data inventory making is the first step in the process of developing and preserving the mangrove ecosystems. It finds that the use of the UAVs for the mangrove ecosystem data inventory making can give high accuracy data. The mangrove cover can easily be identified using image segmentation or onscreen digitization analysis. Finally, the UAVs can be a promising technology in the management and the monitoring of the mangrove ecosystems.",

      "abstract": "Harmful Algal Blooms (HABs) have been observed in all 50 states in the U.S., ranging from large freshwater lakes, such as the Great Lakes, to smaller inland lakes, rivers, and reservoirs, as well as marine coastal areas and estuaries. In 2014, a HAB on Lake Erie containing microcystin (a liver toxin) contaminated the municipal water supply in Toledo, Ohio, providing non-potable water to 400,000 people. Studying HABs is complicated as different cyanobacteria produce a range of toxins that impact human health, such as microcystins, saxitoxin, anatoxin-a, and cylindrospermopsin. HABs may be increasing in prevalence with rising temperatures and higher nutrient runoff. Consequently, new tools and technology are needed to rapidly detect, characterize, and respond to HABs that threaten our water security. A framework is needed to understand cyber threats to new and existing technologies that monitor and forecast our water quality. To properly detect, assess, and mitigate security threats on water infrastructure, it is necessary to envision water security from the perspective of a cyber-physical system (CPS). In doing so, we can evaluate risks and research needs for cyber attacks on HAB-monitoring networks including data injection attacks, automated system hijacking attacks, node forgery attacks, and attacks on learning algorithms. Herein, we provide perspectives on the research needed to understand both the threats posed by HABs and the coupled cyber threats to water security in the context of HABs.",

      "abstract": "Proteins are the most versatile macromolecules in living systems and perform crucial biological functions. In the advent of the post-genomic era, the next generation sequencing is done routinely at the population scale for a variety of species. The challenging problem is to massively determine the functions of proteins that are yet not characterized by detailed experimental studies. Identification of protein functions experimentally is a laborious and time-consuming task involving many resources. We therefore propose the automated protein function prediction methodology using in silico algorithms trained on carefully curated experimental datasets. We present the improved protein function prediction tool FunPred 3.0, an extended version of our previous methodology FunPred 2, which exploits neighborhood properties in protein\u2013protein interaction network (PPIN) and physicochemical properties of amino acids. Our method is validated using the available functional annotations in the PPIN network of Saccharomyces cerevisiae in the latest Munich information center for protein (MIPS) dataset. The PPIN data of S. cerevisiae in MIPS dataset includes 4,554 unique proteins in 13,528 protein\u2013protein interactions after the elimination of the self-replicating and the self-interacting protein pairs. Using the developed FunPred 3.0 tool, we are able to achieve the mean precision, the recall and the F-score values of 0.55, 0.82 and 0.66, respectively. FunPred 3.0 is then used to predict the functions of unpredicted protein pairs (incomplete and missing functional annotations) in MIPS dataset of S. cerevisiae. The method is also capable of predicting the subcellular localization of proteins along with its corresponding functions. The code and the complete prediction results are available freely at: https://github.com/SovanSaha/FunPred-3.0.git.",

      "abstract": "The threat of invasive bigheaded carp swimming into the upper reaches of the Mississippi River (USA) demands new and effective approaches to block these species. To explore how navigational Lock and Dams (LDs) on the Mississippi River could be used to deter the upstream migration of invasive fish species, computer modelling that combined computational fluid dynamics (CFD) and agent-based (AB) fish passage model (CFD-AB model) could be used to hypothetically quantify the passage of bigheaded carp (Hypophthalmichthys spp.) through LDs. Agent-based fish (AB-fish) are always located on a node of the CFD mesh and move by selecting the neighboring node that minimizes fatigue. A possible limitation of this approach is that the AB-fish movement exhibits a dependence upon the CFD mesh. The proposed modified approach allows the AB-fish to occupy any point in the computational domain and to continually (within the size of the time step) update their minimum fatigue path. Computations in a simplified channel/dam structure show that the modified CFD-AB results are smoother swimming trajectories and increased estimates of fish passage when compared to the original CFD-AB model.",

All operations, from sample loading to chromosome scoring, are performed, without human intervention, by the second-generation Rapid Automated Biodosimetry Tool II (RABiT-II) robotic system, a plate imager and custom software, FluorQuantDic. The system requires small volumes of blood (30 \u00b5l per individual) to determine radiation dose received as a result of a radiation accident or terrorist attack. To visualize dicentrics in multiwell plates, we implemented a non-classical protocol for centromere FISH staining at 37\u00b0C. The RABiT-II performs rapid analysis of chromosomes after extracting them from metaphase cells. With the use of multiwell plates, many samples can be screened at the same time. Thus, the RABiT-II DCA provides an advantage during triage when risk-based stratification and medical management are required for a large population exposed to unknown levels of ionizing radiation.",

      "abstract": "In the past years, small unmanned aerial vehicles have increasingly become a hard to defend against threat to both military and civilian infrastructure. Both DIY and COTS UAVs are difficult to detect in a realistic environment, particularly in a cluttered and noisy one such as a port facility. In this context the use of active detection systems such as radar, and lidar is limited since it should not adversely interfere with the normal operation of the port, in particular the existing harbour sensors. This leads our interest towards passive multi-sensor detection systems such as electro-optic (EO) and acoustic monitoring. This work investigates the capability of passive acoustic systems to detect small commercial UAVs within the context of a harbour. We use a machine learning approach to detection using real-world data. We collected audio signatures of several different types of commercial off-the-shelf UAVs both in a quiet environment and in a variety of complex real environment. For this we used a directional 4-microphone array composed of readily available audio components. This setup limited our experiment to the audible spectrum, in which motor and propeller noise are the main characteristics used to distinguish the UAV from the background sounds. We studied machine learning algorithms typically applied to this category of problems, and implemented a Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM) classifier using the Mel-Frequency Cepstrum Coefficient (MFCC) as a feature representation of the audio data, and apply this to the data collected during our measurement campaigns.",

      "abstract": "<p><strong class=\"journal-contentHeaderColor\">Abstract.</strong> Following the general warming trend in Greenland, an increase in calving rates, retreat and ice flow has been observed at ocean-terminating outlet glaciers. These changes contribute substantially to the current mass loss of the Greenland Ice Sheet. In order to constrain models of ice dynamics as well as estimates of mass change, detailed knowledge of geometry and ice flow is needed, in particular on the rapidly changing tongues of ocean-terminating outlet glaciers. In this study, we validate velocity estimates and spatial patterns close to the calving terminus of such an outlet derived from an iterative offset-tracking method based on synthetic aperture radar (SAR) intensity data with a collection of three independent reference measurements of glacier flow. These reference datasets are comprised of measurements from differential GPS, a terrestrial radar interferometer (TRI) and repeated unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) surveys. Our approach to SAR velocity processing aims at achieving a relatively fine grid spacing and a high temporal resolution in order to best resolve the steep velocity gradients in the terminus area and aims to exploit the 12&thinsp;d repeat interval of the single-satellite Sentinel-1A sensor. Results from images of the medium-sized ocean-terminating outlet glacier Eqip Sermia acquired by Sentinel-1A and RADARSAT-2 exhibit a mean difference of 11.5&thinsp;% when compared to the corresponding GPS measurements. An areal comparison of our SAR velocity fields with independently generated velocity maps from TRI and UAV surveys showed good agreement in magnitude and spatial patterns, with mean differences smaller than 0.7&thinsp;m&thinsp;d<span class=\"inline-formula\"><sup>\u22121</sup></span>. In comparison with existing operational velocity products, our SAR-derived velocities show an improved spatial velocity pattern near the margins and calving front. There 8&thinsp;% to 30&thinsp;% higher surface ice velocities are produced, which has implications on ice fluxes and on mass budget estimates of similarly sized outlet glaciers. Further, we show that offset tracking from SAR intensity data at relatively low spatio-temporal sampling intervals is a valid method to derive glacier flow fields for fast-flowing glacier termini of outlet glaciers and, given the repeat period of 12&thinsp;d of the Sentinel-1A sensor (6&thinsp;d with Sentinel-1B), has the potential to be applied operationally in a quasi-continuous mode.</p>",

      "abstract": "Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) has enormous potential in many domains. According to the characteristics of UAV, it is important for UAV network to assure low latency and integrity and authentication of commands sent by command center or command stations to UAV. In this paper, we proposed a UAV network architecture based on mobile edge computing (MEC) which helps guarantee low latency in the UAV network. Afterwards, we proposed a designated verifier proxy blind signature (DVPBS) scheme for UAV network and proved that it is existentially unforgeable under an adaptive chosen message attack in the random oracle model. We compared the efficiency of our DVPBS scheme with other signature schemes by implementing them in jPBC and theoretically analyzing their signature length. The experiment results indicate that our DVPBS scheme is efficient. The signature length of our DVPBS is longer, but it is still short enough compared with the transmission capacity of UAV.",

      "abstract": "The paper deals with subsurface imaging via radar systems mounted onboard aerial platforms. Specifically, the attention is focused on a radar prototype installed on a small unmanned aerial vehicle (S-UAV), previously proposed by few of the authors. In particular, the challenges in terms of electromagnetic modeling and flight dynamics knowledge and control are here tackled. In this frame, an ad-hoc designed data processing strategy is presented; this strategy involves a preprocessing step and a reconstruction step. The pre-processing is performed in time domain and, beyond filtering procedures commonly exploited in radar imaging, involves a procedure devoted to compensate flight altitude variations and to account for the S-UAV trajectory, which is estimated by processing measurements collected by an onboard GPS receiver. In addition, the reconstruction of the investigated scenario is performed by means of a microwave tomographic approach based on a linear model of the electromagnetic scattering and the concept of equivalent dielectric permittivity for the propagation path. This latter allows us to properly face the imaging of buried objects, while avoiding the mathematical complexity introduced by the presence of the air-medium interface. Accordingly, the imaging is faced as a linear inverse scattering problem formulated in the spatial domain similarly to the case of a homogeneous scenario and, thanks to the concept of equivalent permittivity, depth and horizontal position of buried objects are retrieved properly. This is corroborated by means of a numerical analysis accounting for synthetic data.",

      "abstract": "In recent years, intelligent driving navigation and security monitoring have made considerable progress with the help of deep Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). As one of the state-of-the-art perception approaches, semantic segmentation unifies distinct detection tasks widely desired by both autonomous driving and security monitoring. Currently, semantic segmentation shows remarkable efficiency and reliability in standard scenarios such as daytime scenes with favorable illumination conditions. However, in face of adverse conditions such as the nighttime, semantic segmentation loses its accuracy significantly. One of the main causes of the problem is the lack of sufficient annotated segmentation datasets of nighttime scenes. In this paper, we propose a framework to alleviate the accuracy decline when semantic segmentation is taken to adverse conditions by using Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs). To bridge the daytime and nighttime image domains, we made key observation that compared to datasets in adverse conditions, there are considerable amount of segmentation datasets in standard conditions such as BDD and our collected ZJU datasets. Our GAN-based nighttime semantic segmentation framework includes two methods. In the first method, GANs were used to translate nighttime images to the daytime, thus semantic segmentation can be performed using robust models already trained on daytime datasets. In another method, we use GANs to translate different ratio of daytime images in the dataset to the nighttime but still with their labels. In this sense, synthetic nighttime segmentation datasets can be generated to yield models prepared to operate at nighttime conditions robustly. In our experiment, the later method significantly boosts the performance at the nighttime evidenced by quantitative results using Intersection over Union (IoU) and Pixel Accuracy (Acc). We show that the performance varies with respect to the proportion of synthetic nighttime images in the dataset, where the sweet spot corresponds to most robust performance across the day and night. The proposed framework not only makes contribution to the optimization of visual perception in intelligent vehicles, but also can be applied to diverse navigational assistance systems.",

      "abstract": "One of the critical functions in autonomous driving is vehicle localisation, if it is accurate and reliable it allows the safe navigation of the vehicle when operating without human supervision (SAE Levels 4 and 5 of autonomous driving).\n\nThis paper presents the performance results obtained when testing in real conditions an innovative positioning engine based on a safety-oriented paradigm. The tested engine employs a mass market dual-frequency GNSS receiver, intelligent off-the shelf automotive cameras, accurate navigation maps, low-cost inertial sensors and vehicle odometry. A unique feature is the provided integrity layer, estimated in real-time and consisting of Protection Levels (PL), which bound the error of each estimated value with a certain confidence level. This integrity layer is used as part of autonomous vehicle architecture to ensure that the vehicle navigates safely.\n\nThe results show the position performances along with the real confidence levels achieved by the estimated Protection Levels. The solution estimated by the engine in real time is based on the dual-frequency measurements obtained from a mass-market GNSS receiver, the measurements of the lateral distance to the lane-markings provided by an intelligent off-the shelf automotive camera, lane-level accurate navigation maps, the measurements obtained from low-cost inertial sensors and the vehicle odometry. With respect to the engine, it is able to process all these measurements by means of:\n- A real time PPP hybrid algorithm that employs dualfrequency GPS and Galileo measurements, inertial sensors and PPP corrections obtained from a web server when the connection is available through the cellular network. \n- A robust hybrid GNSS standard positioning algorithm allowing to perform consistency checks in parallel \n- An algorithm that improves the accuracy by means of the vehicle sensors, the lateral distance measurements to the road lane markings provided by the automotive intelligent camera and the lane-level accurate maps. It is also able to provide an accurate position relative to the map.\n\nThe position and orientation values provided by the engine (including the position computed relative to the map) are complemented with the estimation of the associated integrity Protection Levels (PL), computed for multiple target integrity risks. The implementation of an integrity layer is crucial since in safety-critical applications it can be more important to know whether the information is reliable than the precise information itself. This integrity layer determines the degree of usability of the location and orientation estimations, which is used as part of autonomous vehicle architecture to ensure that the vehicle operates safely.\n\nThe position and integrity engine has been integrated in an autonomous car and has been tested in real conditions under different environments assessing its performances based on the accurate reference provided by other equipment installed in the car for testing purposes. The paper presents the position and protection level performance results obtained when testing the vehicle under open-sky, sub-urban and deep urban conditions.\n\nThe engine employed to obtain the results presented in this paper has been developed and tested with an autonomous car within the ESCAPE project ([1]). ESCAPE (European Safety Critical Applications Positioning Engine) is a project co-funded under the Fundamental Elements program of the European GNSS Agency (GSA). It started on October 2016 with a duration of 3 years and with the main objective of developing a localisation system that provides the vehicle position and attitude estimations to be employed in safety critical applications like Autonomous Driving (AD) or Advanced Driving Assistance Systems (ADAS). The project is led by the Spanish company FICOSA in collaboration with partners from across Europe: Renault, IFSSTAR and the University of Technology of Compi\u00e8gne (UTC) from France, STMicroelectronics and LINKS Foundation from Italy and GMV from Spain.\n\nESCAPE enables a high-grade of data fusion (GNSS, inertial sensors, cameras and vehicle sensors) and the exploitation of several key technological differentiators such as the precise point positioning service (PPP), the potential use of the Galileo signal authentication and the provision of an integrity layer to assess the degree of trust one can associate to the position information provided by the device. Therefore, the three key pillars of the safetyoriented navigation technology provided by ESCAPE engine are:\n* The smart exploitation of different localization data sources to provide a highly accurate navigation solution, including GPS and Galileo dual-frequency measurements, intelligent cameras providing lateral distance to road lane-marks, inertial measurement units, vehicle odometry, PPP corrections and high definition maps; \n* The unique provision of real-time integrity protection levels associated to the location estimates, which express the \u201cdegree of usability\u201d of the positioning information for safety-critical applications. The PLs associated to the positions computed relative to the map are fundamental for autonomous driving applications;\n* The full integration of the ESCAPE engine into a vehicle with autonomous driving capabilities, and its test on several different reference paths and environmental conditions.\n\nThe innovative ESCAPE GNSS Engine (EGE) is close-tomarket, its components are organized in a modular architecture and has safety at its core as its specification and design are based on the ISO 26262 recommendations ([2]). \n\nESCAPE was already introduced in [3]. The following sections provide a brief description of the ESCAPE objectives, its design (system, HW and SW) and the positioning and integrity algorithms (see [3] for further details) before describing the tests that have been carried out and the performance results obtained in open-sky, suburban and urban environments.",

      "abstract": "In recent years, the traditional automotive industry has also begun to enter the field of autonomous driving technology, seeking new breakthroughs. From simple pedestrian and vehicle detection, to the instance segmentation of traffic scenes, to the ideal all-intelligent driving, it has begun to be occupied by deep learning. Research scholars have tried to build a vehicle's control strategy system entirely using computers and also proposed a full convolutional neural network that replaced the fully connected structure with convolutional ideas, realizing the transition from image classification to dense pixel prediction. This is the first step for neural network to be used for scene instance segmentation, and it is also a key step for intelligent driving. However, the effect of the full convolutional neural network is not very ideal. An important problem is that the pooling layer will lose part of the location information while aggregating the background. For dense prediction of image instance segmentation, the context information (location information) of each pixel is indispensable, which is very important for the final classification of pixels. Thus, later researchers proposed three different structures to solve this problem: cavity convolution structure, codec structure, space pyramid structure. This paper analyzes the working principles and characteristics of several different structures and compares the differences between various networks. This paper combines a Mask-RCNN to construct a new network structure for image instance segmentation. The main innovations of this paper are as follows: 1. Introduce generative adversarial network into the field of image segmentation. Combine the conditional generative adversarial network idea, using the original image as the input of the generator, and the generative to generate the desired instance segmentation result. Combine the original image with the instance segmentation result generated by the generative, or combine the original image with the manually labeled segmentation result as the input to the discriminator. By training the network so that the discriminator cannot distinguish between the image generated by the generator and the result of the manual annotation, the generator can generate a satisfactory image segmentation result. 2. Introduce superpixel information of the image. In this paper, the boundary information obtained by superpixel segmentation is input into the generator network as a segmentation condition. For the original input image, this paper uses superpixel segmentation method to obtain the subtle contour of the image, and then stacks the superpixel segmentation result with the original image as the input of the generated network. 3. Reconstructed a new image segmentation structure. In the image translation model, the processing at the boundary is often difficult to achieve good results, so this article changes the output layer of the generator to K (K represents the number of classifications) channels to output the results. This paper adopts the Encoder-Decoder structure in DeconvNet, removes the full connection layer to reduce the model parameters, and changes the pooled indexing method to the direct stacking structure.",

      "abstract": "The miniaturization and affordable production of integrated microelectronics have improved in recent years, making unmanned aerial systems (UAS) accessible to consumers and igniting their interest. Researchers have proposed UAS-based solutions for almost any conceivable problem, but the greatest impact will likely be in applications that exploit the unique advantages of the technology: work in dangerous or difficult-to-access areas, high spatial resolution and/or frequent measurements of environmental phenomena, and deployment of novel sensing technology over small to moderate spatial scales. Examples of such applications may be the identification of wetland areas and use of high-resolution spatial data for hydrological modeling. However, because of the large\u2014and growing\u2014assortment of aircraft and sensors available on the market, an evolving regulatory environment, and limited practical guidance or examples of wetland mapping with UAS, it has been difficult to confidently devise or recommend UAS-based monitoring strategies for these applications. This paper provides a comprehensive review of UAS hardware, software, regulations, scientific applications, and data collection/post-processing procedures that are relevant for wetland monitoring and hydrological modeling.",

      "abstract": "In the last years, several studies have addressed the introduction of the GNSS technology in the framework of the high integrity positioning methods for the land transportation. The main emphasis has been spent for the rail environment. The main driver is the possibility to realize cost effective solution for the modernization of the lines without losses in terms of safety. Furthermore, the rail community have recognized GNSS as one of the step charge innovation foreseen in the next generation train control systems. In the recent period, there has been some attempts to exploit the outcome of such studies even in the driverless car applications. As a matter of fact, these two transportation means share the same electromagnetical environment and both of them are subjected to constrained movement profile. Since one of the most important KI in the safety related application is represented by the integrity, we considered the presence of an external augmentation and integrity monitoring network. Particularly, we considered three different approaches for augmenting the PVT solution that are respectively the local area augmentation network, the wide area augmentation network and the 2-tiers augmentation schemes. For all these schemes we carried out the SWOT analysis considering the peculiarities of the application. On the basis of the SWOT, the system integrator can decide to implement the network that better suit its own requirement. In or vision, the best solution is to share a unique augmentation network for both rail and connected cars. In this way it is possible to increase the number of user served by the network itself.",

      "abstract": "Abstract Context A series of unprovoked shark attacks on New South Wales (Australia) beaches between 2013 and 2015 triggered an investigation of new and emerging technologies for protecting bathers. Traditionally, bather protection has included several methods for shark capture, detection and/or deterrence but has often relied on environmentally damaging techniques. Heightened environmental awareness, including the important role of sharks in the marine ecosystem, demands new techniques for protection from shark attack. Recent advances in drone-related technologies have enabled the possibility of real-time shark detection and alerting. Aim To determine the reliability of drones to detect shark analogues in the water across a range of environmental conditions experienced on New South Wales beaches. Methods A standard multirotor drone (DJI Inspire 1) was used to detect shark analogues as a proxy during flights at 0900, 1200 and 1500 hours over a 3-week period. The 27 flights encompassed a range of environmental conditions, including wind speed (2\u201330.0\u2009km\u2009h\u22121), turbidity (0.4\u20136.4\u2009m), cloud cover (0\u2013100%), glare (0\u2013100%), seas (0.4\u20131.4\u2009m), swells (1.4\u20132.5\u2009m) and sea state (Beaufort Scale 1\u20135 Bf). Key results Detection rates of the shark analogues over the 27 flights were significantly higher for the independent observer conducting post-flight video analysis (50%) than for the drone pilot (38%) (Wald P\u2009=\u20090.04). Water depth and turbidity significantly impaired detection of analogues (Wald P\u2009=\u20090.04). Specifically, at a set depth of 2\u2009m below the water surface, very few analogues were seen by the observer or pilot when water turbidity reduced visibility to less than 1.5\u2009m. Similarly, when water visibility was greater than 1.5\u2009m, the detection rate was negatively related to water depth. Conclusions The present study demonstrates that drones can fly under most environmental conditions and would be a cost-effective bather protection tool for a range of user groups. Implications The most effective use of drones would occur during light winds and in shallow clear water. Although poor water visibility may restrict detection, sharks spend large amounts of time near the surface, therefore providing a practical tool for detection in most conditions.",

      "abstract": "\r\n\r\nUAV (Unmanned Aerial Vehicle) images can be exploited for rapid forest fire damage assessment by virtue of UAV systems' advantages. In 2019, catastrophic forest fire occurred in Goseong and Sokcho, Korea and burned 1,757 hectares of forests. We visited the town in Goseong where suffered the most severe damage and conducted UAV flights for forest fire damage assessment. In this study, economic and rapid damage assessment method for forest fire has been proposed using UAV systems equipped with only a RGB sensor. First, forest masking was performed using automatic elevation thresholding to extract forest area. Then ExG (Excess Green) vegetation index which can be calculated without near-infrared band was adopted to extract damaged forests. In addition, entropy filtering was applied to ExG for better differentiation between damaged and non-damaged forest. We could confirm that the proposed forest masking can screen out non-forest land covers such as bare soil, agriculture lands, and artificial objects. In addition, entropy filtering enhanced the ExG homogeneity difference between damaged and non-damaged forests. The automatically detected damaged forests of the proposed method showed high accuracy of 87%.",

      "abstract": "<p>\n<b>Background</b>\u00e2\u0080\u0083The design of computerized systems able to support automated detection of threatening conditions in critically ill patients such as systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS) and sepsis has been fostered recently. The increase of research work in this area is due to both the growing digitalization in health care and the increased appreciation of the importance of early sepsis detection and intervention. To be able to understand the variety of systems and their characteristics as well as performances, a systematic literature review is required. Existing reviews on this topic follow a rather restrictive searching methodology or they are outdated. As much progress has been made during the last 5 years, an updated review is needed to be able to keep track of current developments in this area of research.</p>\n <p>\n<b>Objectives</b>\u00e2\u0080\u0083To provide an overview about current approaches for the design of clinical decision-support systems (CDSS) in the context of SIRS, sepsis, and septic shock, and to categorize and compare existing approaches.</p>\n <p>\n<b>Methods</b>\u00e2\u0080\u0083A systematic literature review was performed in accordance with the preferred reporting items for systematic reviews and meta-analyses (PRISMA) statement. Searches for eligible articles were conducted on five electronic bibliographic databases, including PubMed/MEDLINE, IEEE Xplore, Embase, Scopus, and ScienceDirect. Initial results were screened independently by two reviewers based on clearly defined eligibility criteria. A backward as well as an updated search enriched the initial results. Data were extracted from included articles and presented in a standardized way. Articles were classified into predefined categories according to characteristics extracted previously. The classification was performed according to the following categories: clinical setting including patient population and mono- or multicentric study, support type of the system such as prediction or detection, systems characteristics such as knowledge- or data-driven algorithms used, evaluation of methodology, and results including ground truth definition, sensitivity, and specificity. All results were assessed qualitatively by two reviewers.</p>\n <p>\n<b>Results</b>\u00e2\u0080\u0083The search resulted in 2,373 articles out of which 55 results were identified as eligible. Over 80% of the articles describe monocentric studies. More than 50% include adult patients, and only four articles explicitly report the inclusion of pediatric patients. Patient recruitment often is very selective, which can be observed from highly varying inclusion and exclusion criteria. The task of disease detection is covered in 62% of the articles; prediction of upcoming conditions in 33%. Sepsis is covered in 67% of the articles, SIRS as sole entity in only 4%, whereas 27% focus on severe sepsis and/or septic shock. The most common combinations of categories \u00e2\u0080\u009calgorithm used\u00e2\u0080\u009d and \u00e2\u0080\u009csupport type\u00e2\u0080\u009d are knowledge-based detection of sepsis and data-driven prediction of sepsis. In evaluations, manual chart review (38%) and diagnosis coding (29%) represent the most frequently used ground truth definitions; most studies present a sample size between 10,001 and 100,000 cases (31%) and performances highly differ with only five articles presenting sensitivities and specificities above 90%; four of them using knowledge-based rather than machine learning algorithms. The presentations of holistic CDSS approaches, including technical implementation details, system interfaces, and data and interoperability aspects enabling the use of CDSS in routine settings are missing in nearly all articles.</p>\n <p>\n<b>Conclusions</b>\u00e2\u0080\u0083The review demonstrated the high variety of research in this context successfully. A clear trend is observable toward the use of data-driven algorithms, and a lack of research could be identified in covering the pediatric population as well as acknowledging SIRS as an independent and threatening condition. The quality as well as the significance of the presented evaluations for assessing the performances of the algorithms in clinical routine settings are often not meeting the current standard of scientific work. Our future interest will be concentrated on these realistic settings by implementing and evaluating SIRS detection approaches as well as considering factors to make the CDSS useable in clinical routine from both technical and medical perspectives.</p>\n ",

      "abstract": "Many conditions affecting the heart, brain and even the eyes have their origin on blood vessel pathology, underscoring the role of vascular regulation. In age-related macular degeneration (AMD), there is excessive growth of abnormal blood vessels in the eye (choroidal neovascularization), eventually leading to vision loss due to detachment of retinal pigmented epithelium. As the advanced stage of this disease involves loss of retinal pigmented epithelium, much less attention has been given to early vascular events such as endothelial dysfunction. Although current gold standard therapy using inhibitors of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) have achieved initial successes, some drawbacks include the lack of long-term restoration of visual acuity, as well as a subset of the patients being refractory to existing treatment, alluding us and others to hypothesize upon VEGF-independent mechanisms. Against this backdrop, we present here a non-exhaustive review on the vascular underpinnings of AMD, implications with genetic and systemic factors, experimental models for studying choroidal neovascularization, and interestingly, on both endothelial-centric pathways and non-cell autonomous mechanisms. We hope to shed light on future research directions in improving vascular function in ocular disorders.",

      "abstract": "Considerable progress with unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) has led to an increasing need for counter-UAV systems to detect present, potentially threatening or misused drones. Therefore, a UAV detection algorithm has been developped recently for day and night operation. Whereas high resolution VIS cameras enable to detect UAVs in daylight in further distances, surveillance at night is performed with a short wave infrared (SWIR) camera. The proposed method is based on temporal median computation, structural adaptive image differencing, codebook-based background learning, local density computation, and shape analysis of foreground structures to perform an improved near range change detection for UAVs. Areas with moving scene parts, like leaves in the wind or driving cars on a street, are recognized to minimize false alarms. This paper presents a significant improvement with respect to some of the most challenging tasks in this field, e.g., increasing the UAV detection sensitivity in front of trees with waving leaves, false alarm minimization, and avoiding the background model update problem. The provided results illustrate the reached performance in a variety of different situations.",

      "abstract": "Yeast Two-Hybrid (Y2H) and reverse Two-Hybrid (RY2H) are powerful protein\u2013protein interaction screening methods that rely on the interaction of bait and prey proteins fused to DNA binding (DB) and activation domains (AD), respectively. Y2H allows identification of protein interaction partners using screening libraries, while RY2H is used to determine residues critical to a given protein\u2013protein interaction by exploiting site-directed mutagenesis. Currently, both these techniques still rely on sequencing of positive clones using conventional Sanger sequencing. For Y2H, a screen can yield several positives; the identification of such clones is further complicated by the fact that sequencing products usually contain vector sequence. For RY2H, obtaining a complete sequence is required to identify the full range of residues involved in protein\u2013protein interactions. However, with Sanger sequencing limited to 500\u2013800 nucleotides, sequencing is usually carried from both ends for clones greater than this length. Analysis of such RY2H data thus requires assembly of sequencing products combined with trimming of vector sequences and of low-quality bases at the beginning and ends of sequencing products. Further, RY2H analysis requires collation of mutations that abrogate a DB/AD interaction. Here, we present 2HybridTools, a Java program with a user-friendly interface that allows addressing all these issues inherent to both Y2H and RY2H. Specifically, for Y2H, 2HybridTools enables automated identification of positive clones, while for RY2H, 2HybridTools provides detailed mutation reports as a basis for further investigation of given protein\u2013protein interactions.",

      "abstract": "Background Symptomatic carotid artery disease (CAD) may cause modified blood supply to the retina possibly leading to retinal structure changes. Results of previous studies in asymptomatic CAD were heterogeneous in retinal layer changes measured by OCT. The objectives of this prospective, non-interventional study were to investigate if structural retinal changes occur in symptomatic CAD patients with macroangiopathic ischemic stroke or transient ischemic attack (TIA). Methods We used spectral-domain optical coherence tomography (SD-OCT) to cross-sectionally and longitudinally analyze the retinal morphology of CAD patients with macroangiopathic ischemic stroke or TIA not permanently affecting the visual pathway. We employed semi-automated segmentation of macular volume scans to assess the macular retinal layers\u2019 thickness and peripapillary ring scans to determine the peripapillary retinal nerve fiber layer thickness using the contralateral eye and eyes of microangiopathic ischemic stroke patients with matched age, gender and vascular risk factors as control. Visual function and visual field deficits were assessed by multifocal visual evoked potentials (mfVEP). Results Neither the thickness of retinal layers measured by SD-OCT in 17 patients nor the mfVEP latency or amplitude in 10 patients differed between the symptomatic stenotic, the contralateral internal carotid artery (ICA) side and the control group of 17 microangiopathic stroke patients at baseline. Furthermore, longitudinal investigations of 10 patients revealed no significant changes of any retinal layer 4 months after ischemic stroke or TIA. Conclusion In conclusion, our study revealed no evidence for an impact of symptomatic carotid artery disease on retinal structure or functional impairment of the visual pathway. ",

UAV technologies are developing much faster than means of their control and detection. RADAR technology is one of the means of UAV\u2019s detection. Usually, radars are expensive, and usage of high-power radiation is problematic in many cases.\r\nToday\u2019s market provides low cost marine radar working on various principles of operation. Such radar are not optimal, but could be used for UAV detection. Detection possibility of UAVs by FMCW marine radar was investigated by using two types of small UAVs as targets.",

      "abstract": "GPS signals are weak in nature and are often a target of electronic attacks that aim to manipulate or disable navigation systems. As unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) become more ubiquitous, the manipulation of GPS capable UAVs is becoming a greater threat to their use. One method of mitigating these attacks employs the use of multiple antenna arrays. These arrays are utilized in many GPS dependent systems. These GPS capable UAVs using multiple antennas are restricted to a short baseline multi-antenna system similar to Controlled Reception Pattern Arrays (CRPA) sizes. Differential GPS measurements are used for Angle of Arrival (AOA) calculations which are used to locate the threat in question. The AOA estimations and attitude are a function of the baseline of the multi-antenna array in use. This paper explores the analysis of multiple antenna baselines and the impact the chosen baseline length has on the estimation of the electronic threat location.\n\nPreviously, threat locations have been estimated as shown in work by Gray, Thompson, Mahmood and others. Numerous papers focusing on geolocation of threats show results of long (defined as greater than carrier phase wavelength) baseline geolocation. Gray\u2019s work focuses on AOA techniques involving a larger baseline array, which is not feasible on a compact UAV. The work done by Gray also focuses on a 2-dimensional system and does not reference any elevation change between emitter and receiver. Work done by Costa focuses on an aerial platform but uses a large baseline. Costa\u2019s AOA estimation methods are evaluated with a system with one wavelength spacing between antennas. Ina addition to publications on large baseline arrays, there have been several publications focusing on uniform linear arrays and geolocation accuracy, as from Zahemia and Huang, but these do not consider the three dimensional geolocation. Prior work by Corderio shows different forms of UAV attitude estimation on a short baseline array but also includes additional sensors in the solution for the system. While different baselines are considered in Corderio\u2019s work, his solutions are focused on the fusion of multiple sensors and not the impact the baseline has.\n\nA primary motivator for this paper is the fact that UAVs typically have a very limited capacity for additional electronics. As weight is added, power consumption of the UAV increases as flight times and speeds decrease. Keeping these limitations in mind, a multi-antenna system can become constrained by size and weight limitations on the given platform. This motivates using as few antennas as possible to minimize weight and explore the impact of baseline on the geolocation of threats. In addition to the effects of the baseline, UAVs using pathfinding designed to avoid electronic threats can still fall victim to the attack if the uncertainty of the geolocation is not considered. In addition to commercial use, this geolocation system could be law enforcement searching for threats. The uncertainty of the location of the threat is vital for law enforcement\u2019s ability to locate and disable the source of the interference.\n\nThis paper explores the impact the array has on geolocation. An antenna array capable of GPS attitude solutions is the only form of navigation sensor used. For the purpose of the paper, the baseline from antenna to antenna is limited from ten percent of the GPS L1 wavelength to just under the GPS L1 wavelength. The carrier phase differences between antenna pairs are the measurements used for the attitude to keep the attitude solution dependent on the same measurements. The attitude solution is solved in a least squares estimation resulting in the relative rotation of Euler angles from the body frame to the East North Up frame (ENU). The attitude of the UAV is solved after each GPS update. After producing an attitude solution, AOA estimation methods are used on the antenna array signals to produce AOAs for the observed signals. An assumption made here is the detection of the invalid signal has been done successfully. The invalid signal is then assumed as being excluded from the position and attitude solutions returning the system to a similar state before the threat is introduced. The AOA estimation is produced in the body frame of the UAV. The attitude estimation previously solved is combined with the AOA estimation and transformed to the global frame to be used in a least squares estimation across multiple time steps. The position, attitude and AOA errors are combined to create a threat geolocation error as a function of antenna baseline. The results of the geolocation confidence should be quantified by the standard deviation of the combined results. This standard deviation should be shown as a function of the antenna baselines. This information can be used in system design for autonomous UAVs and threat location devices to find the capabilities and limitations of the systems being designed.",

      "abstract": "With the development of science and technology, unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) is more and more widely used to bring a lot of convenience to the society, but also led to serious threats to public security, personal privacy, military security and other aspects. Therefore, it is increasingly important to find unknown drones quickly and accurately. In UAV detection, the technologies based on acoustic, radio and radar detection are common, but these technologies usually require expensive equipment and strict configuration. However, the method based on machine vision has the advantages of low cost and simple configuration. In addition, detection and recognition methods based on deep learning have been fully developed, but most of them are for a single visible image, and the detection and recognition effect is limited. In this paper, a fast detection and identification method based is proposed based on the backbone of YOLOv3 (You Only Look Once version3). And dual-channel detectors were used as data sources. In this method, infrared and visible images are simultaneously input into the network for feature extraction, and the extracted depth features are concatenated. Then the multi-scale prediction network is used to regression the target location to obtain the final detection and recognition results. Finally, by collecting real UAV data sets, the network is trained and tested for comparative experiments. Experimental results show that the mAP of method in this paper is worthy of improvement, and the detection speed remains at 27images/s.",

      "abstract": "Much current work in robotics focuses on the development of robots capable of autonomous unsupervised learning. An essential prerequisite for such learning to be possible is that the agent should be sensitive to the link between its actions and the consequences of its actions, called sensorimotor contingencies. This sensitivity, and more particularly its role as a key drive of development, has been widely studied by developmental psychologists. However, the results of these studies may not necessarily be accessible or intelligible to roboticians. In this paper, we review the main experimental data demonstrating the role of sensitivity to sensorimotor contingencies in infants\u2019 acquisition of four fundamental motor and cognitive abilities: body knowledge, memory, generalization and goal-directedness. We relate this data from developmental psychology to work in robotics, highlighting the links between these two domains of research. In the last part of the article we present a blueprint architecture demonstrating how exploitation of sensitivity to sensorimotor contingencies, combined with the notion of \"goal\", allows an agent to develop new sensorimotor skills. This architecture can be used to guide the design of specific computational models, and also to possibly envisage new empirical experiments.",

      "abstract": "Abstract The Caribbean is a mega-diverse and bio-geographically important region that consists of the Caribbean Sea, its islands, and surrounding coastlines. Among the billions of aquatic species inhabiting this region, the mega-vertebrates stand out for their social, economic and ecologic relevance. However, the Caribbean has been threatened by climate change, poverty, pollution, environmental degradation and intense growth of the tourism industry, affecting megafauna species directly and indirectly. Population monitoring plays a critical role in an informed conservation process and helps guide management decisions at several scales. The aim of the present review was to critically examine the methods employed for monitoring marine megafauna in the Caribbean, so as to create a framework for future monitoring efforts. In total, 235 documents describing protocols for the monitoring of sirenians, cetaceans, elasmobranchs, sea turtles and crocodilians in the Caribbean region, were reviewed. The methods included community-based monitoring (interviews, citizen science and fisheries monitoring), aerial surveys (by manned and unmanned aerial vehicles), boat-based surveys (including manta tow, and side-scan sonars), land-based surveys, acoustic monitoring, underwater surveys, baited remote underwater video, mark\u2013recapture, photo-identification and telemetry. Monitoring efforts invested on aquatic megafauna in the Caribbean have been highly different, with some species and/or groups being prioritised over others. The present critical review provides a country-based overview of the current and emerging methods for monitoring marine megafauna and a critical evaluation of their known advantages, disadvantages and biases.",

      "abstract": "Urbanization and climate change are driving increases in urban land surface temperatures that pose a threat to human and environmental health. To address this challenge, we must be able to observe land surface temperatures within spatially complex urban environments. However, many existing remote sensing studies are based upon satellite or aerial imagery that capture temperature at coarse resolutions that fail to capture the spatial complexities of urban land surfaces that can change at a sub-meter resolution. This study seeks to fill this gap by evaluating the spatial variability of land surface temperatures through drone thermal imagery captured at high-resolutions (13 cm). In this study, flights were conducted using a quadcopter drone and thermal camera at two case study locations in Milwaukee, Wisconsin and El Paso, Texas. Results indicate that land use types exhibit significant variability in their surface temperatures (3.9\u201315.8 \u00b0C) and that this variability is influenced by surface material properties, traffic, weather and urban geometry. Air temperature and solar radiation were statistically significant predictors of land surface temperature (R2 0.37\u20130.84) but the predictive power of the models was lower for land use types that were heavily impacted by pedestrian or vehicular traffic. The findings from this study ultimately elucidate factors that contribute to land surface temperature variability in the urban environment, which can be applied to develop better temperature mitigation practices to protect human and environmental health.",

      "abstract": "To combat the threat posed by jammers, a UAS based system has been developed to be able to rapidly localize the source of GPS interferers. Previously, the focus of the project, an unmanned aerial system (UAS) known as JAGER, has been on the development of a system capable of localizing a single static radio frequency interference (RFI) source [1]. JAGER is a UAS comprised of three main systems: the sensor to measure the bearing to the interference source, the localization system responsible for estimating the source location, and a path planning system to fly the vehicle in a way to minimize the cost of localization (typically thought of as the time to localize a source within a threshold) [2]. This works presents an analysis of the capabilities of the sensor, a phased array antenna, in an environment with multiple RFI sources. Understanding the sensor capabilities is key to being able to choose the right approach for localization and path planning. \n\n\nThe introduction of additional interference sources poses a key challenge on the sensor\u2019s ability to detect and measure the bearing to multiple sources simultaneously from a single receive signal strength (RSS) pattern. This paper presents a characterization and theoretical analysis of the performance of a 3-, 7-, and 19-element array in an environment with multiple interference sources. The difference in beamwidths of the different array sizes and side lobe suppression result in biases in the bearing measurements for the smaller arrays, while the larger arrays come at additional size, weight, and monetary costs, creating a set of tradeoffs to be considered for a system to localize multiple RFI sources from a UAS. To detect multiple sources, JAGER uses an onboard beam steering antenna to generate an RSS pattern (by measuring signal strength). For each RSS pattern, the bearing to each of the lobes detected is determined using the 3dB method used for bearing determination to a single source [3]. The theoretical performance of this method is evaluated in two different simulated multi-source environments. Finally, some design constraints are presented for the bearing sensor for detecting multiple sources based on the desired angular separation capabilities.",

      "abstract": "Explosive hazards pose a threat to both civilians and warfighters in areas of current and past conflict. The U.S. Army Combat Capabilities Development Command (CCDC) has been exploring the use of an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV)-mounted ultra-wideband (UWB) radar to image and detect obscured explosive hazards. In a stripmap modality, a synthetic aperture radar system travels in a straight line and takes measurements perpendicular to the platform\u2019s direction of travel. The large angular diversity provided by the platform motion yields a fine cross-range resolution of the imaged scene. This problem space is being simulated in MATLAB to determine the feasibility of buried target detection and to identify the optimal parameters of operation on a UAV. Parameters such as platform height, incident angle, and bandwidth are investigated. It is shown that performance at different platform heights is determined by the dependence of the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) on elevation. Furthermore, a minimum platform height is required to meet the minimum requirements of the time-bandwidth product for pulsed waveforms. An optimal transmit angle can be found by maximizing the target-to-clutter ratio (TCR). The target radar cross section (RCS) is taken from finite-difference time-domain (FDTD) models of targets of interest, and the clutter is simulated using the small perturbation method (SPM) for distributed clutter. Finally, the required resolution and bandwidth of the system are presented.",

      "abstract": "Increased use of global satellite navigation systems (GNSS), for applications such as autonomous vehicles, intelligent transportation systems and drones, heightens security concerns. Civil GNSS signals are vulnerable to notably spoofing and replay attacks. To counter such attacks, cryptographic methods are developed: Navigation Message Authentication (NMA) is one such scheme, about to be deployed for Galileo E1 Open Service (OS); it allows receivers to verify the signal origin and protects navigation message integrity. However, NMA signals cannot fully thwart replay attacks, which do not require forging navigation messages. Classic replay attacks, e.g, meaconing, retransmit previously recorded signals without any modification, thus highly limiting the capacity of the adversary. Distance-decreasing (DD) attacks are a strong type of replay attack, allowing fine-grained individual pseudorange manipulation in real time. Moreover, DD attacks counterbalance processing and transmission delays induced by adversary, by virtue of shifting earlier in time the perceived (relayed) signal arrival; thus shortening the pseudorange measurements. In this paper, we first analyze how DD attacks can harm the Galileo E1 OSNMA service assuming the adversary has no prior information on the navigation message. Moreover,we propose a DD attack detection method based on a Goodness of Fit test on the prompt correlator outputs of the victim. The results show that the method can detect the DD attacks even when the receiver has locked to the DD signals.",

The algorithm processes measurement sets computed for each satellite, namely, carrier phase, pseudorange and carrier-to-noise ratio, creating clusters of consistent measurements, thus allowing the identification of satellite signals suffering from the multipath error. Since it is an unsupervised method, it overcomes one of the most limiting features of supervised algorithms that require training data sets a-priori obtained as representative of multipath and no-multipath conditions. The study exploits both the real GNSS data affected by the multipath in the surrounding environment that were collected at South African Antarctic research base SANAE-IV and the simulated data where the ionospheric, tropospheric and multipath errors are modelled. Receiver Autonomous Integrity Monitoring (RAIM) algorithm with parity method was also implemented and tested for the same datasets, and it will be used as a term of comparison for the algorithm performance.",

The aerodynamic analysis tool developed by the coupling of the numerical nonlinear lifting-line method to Xfoil is used to obtain lift and drag coefficients of the baseline wing. The outcomes are compared with the results of the solver based on the nonlinear lifting-line theory implemented into XLFR5 and the transition shear stress transport model implemented into ANSYS-Fluent. The agreement between the results at the low and moderate angle of attack values is observed. The sequential quadratic programming algorithm of the MATLAB optimization toolbox is used for the solution of the constrained optimization problems. Three different optimization problems are solved.

The functional constraints related to the wing weight, the wing planform area, and the root bending moment are added to the first optimization problem, and the second optimization problem is constructed. The third optimization problem is obtained by adding the level flight condition and the available power constraints at the maximum speed and the level flight condition at the minimum speed of the baseline unmanned air vehicle to the second problem. It is demonstrated that defining the root bending moment, the wing area, and the available power constraints in the aerodynamic optimization problems leads to more realistic wing planform and airfoil shapes.",

      "abstract": "Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) are flying robots that require little or no human control while flying. The number of UAV has growth exponentially due to rise in applications such as video taking, surveillance and delivering cargo to customers. Despite the promise of the technology, UAV are not fully reliable currently, either civil or military. They lack of sensing mechanisms to detect issues in operation, such as impacts, hard landings and overload, together with the difficulties to detect structural problems during the UAV operation could compromise not only the safety of the UAV, also all along the entire flying area. This paper presents the design, development implementation, and validation of a Structural Health Monitoring (SHM) system applied to the rear fuselage of the UAV developed by INTA for R&D activities (MILANO). The rear fuselage, a 2.5 meters carbon/epoxy structure with frames and stringers, was instrumented with fiber optic sensors and PZT. Two different types of fiber optic sensors (FOS) were considered: Fiber Bragg Gratings (FBG) and distributed fiber sensing based on Rayleigh backscatter. The objective of the fiber optic sensor network is to detect the changes induced on the strain field due to damage appearance. Different algorithms, such PCA and Artificial Neural Network (ANN) will be discussed. Validation will be performed with measurements on a real structure with increasing damages by removing rivets progressively at different load levels. Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks, a type of Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN), will be proposed for accurate damage detection with the FBG sensing network in real time operations.",

      "abstract": "The cybersecurity of autonomous vehicles (AV) is an important emerging area of research in traffic safety. Because human failure is the most common reason for a successful cyberattack, human-factor researchers and psychologists might improve AV cybersecurity by researching how to decrease the probability of a successful attack. We review some areas of research connected to the human factor in cybersecurity and find many potential issues. Psychologists might research the characteristics of people prone to cybersecurity failure, the types of scenarios they fail in and the factors that influence this failure or over-trust of AV. Human behavior during a cyberattack might be researched, as well as how to educate people about cybersecurity. Multitasking has an effect on the ability to defend against a cyberattack and research is needed to set the appropriate policy. Human-resource researchers might investigate the skills required for personnel working in AV cybersecurity and how to detect potential defectors early. The psychological profile of cyber attackers should be investigated to be able to set policies to decrease their motivation. Finally, the decrease of driver\u2019s driving skills as a result of using AV and its connection to cybersecurity skills is also worth of research. ",

      "abstract": "In the last years, the Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs), also known as drones, are becoming always more attractive due to their capacity of a rapid deployment and their wide range of application in many real world scenarios. Among the various fields of application, recently, the use of drones in the precision agriculture is becoming much relevant for the researchers community. The studies related to agriculture concern different aspects such as livestock monitoring, crops and water levels. The drones are able to perform these tasks thank to a series of different sensors and actuators equipped on board. Cameras on board allow, through opportune algorithms, the gathering of detailed information about plants health. If a health problem is detected then the the drone can intervene precisely on the specific problem. The contribution of this work is a communication protocols analysis applied to the problem of controlling a fleet of drones against parasites attacks to the crops. Moreover, the study of the different approaches aims to measure their performance and costs. In particular, the various approaches face also the issues of exploring the area in the shortest time possible avoiding that the same area is explored from more drones, discovering the parasites and preventing their proliferation spraying the right quantity of pesticide. The drones, being equipped with limited quantities of both fuel and pesticide, can ask for help to other drones to complete the elimination of the parasites. To face these last issues some recruitment protocols have been tested, focusing on bio-inspired one.",

      "abstract": "The Internet of Vehicles (IoV) represents the emerging paradigm where vehicles are (almost) always connected to the Internet to deliver and receive information to/from other services so as to augment the knowledge and services the users can benefit from when moving in urban and rural areas by their vehicles, but not only. Furthermore, the exploitation of social networking notions into the IoV has brought to the definition of the Social IoV (SIoV) paradigm, i.e., a social network where every vehicle is capable of establishing social relationships in an autonomous way with other vehicles or road infrastructure equipment. In this paper, we propose an implementation of the SIoV leveraging on an existing cloud-based IoT platform to manage the social activity of the vehicles as defined by the SIoV paradigm. The contribution of the paper is multifold: (i) we define some static and dynamic relationships that can be established between vehicles and road infrastructures taking part to the SIoV; (ii) we show how the proposed system can be integrated into the standard Intelligent Transportation System Station Architecture (ITS SA); (iii) we illustrate an effective low-cost and flexible solution for the On-Board Unit (OBU) to enable every vehicles to participate in the SIoV and create their own relationships; (iv) we show the results of the conducted experimental tests for the creation of social relationships aimed at comparing the performance of Bluetooth, 802.11p and Wi-Fi technologies when used to manage vehicles\u00e2\u0080\u0099 radio visibility. Finally, we present two use cases: the Vehicle Diagnostic and the Smart Parking applications. \u00c2\u00a9 2018 Elsevier B.V.",

      "abstract": "The privacy in VANET is an essential issue because the identity and the real-time location of the user can threat his safety if misused. To address this problem, many researchers focused on the use of certified pseudonyms and their change strategies to ensure the un-linkability and anonymity. IEEE 1609.2 Standard defined the certificates formats and pseudonym certifying process. However, it did not precise the communication procedure between the certifying authority and the requesting vehicle. In this paper, we propose a new privacy-preserving scheme for pseudonym on-demand refilling, in which the vehicle authenticates itself anonymously to the Regional authority subsidiaries of the central trusted authority to request a new set of pseudonyms. Our proposal is formulated using Burrows, Abadi and Needham (BAN) logic to prove its correctness, it is also specified and verified using SPAN (Security Protocol ANimator) and AVISPA (Automated Validation of Internet Security Protocols and Applications) tools. The logical demonstration showed that the authentication can be achieved while the privacy is preserved. The SPAN and AVISPA tools proved that it is secure against replay attack and session hijacking. \u00c2\u00a9 2018 IEEE.",

      "abstract": "Vehicular ad hoc networks (VANETs) are characterized by frequent routing path failures due to the high mobility caused by the sudden changes of the direction of vehicles. The routing paths between two different vehicles should be established with this challenge in mind. Stability and connectedness are a mandatory condition to ensure a robust and reliable data delivery. The idea behind this work is to exploit a new reactive routing technique to provide regulated and well-connected routing paths. Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) or what are referred to as drones can be both involved in the discovery process and be full members in these discovered paths in order to avoid possible disconnections on the ground when the network is sparsely connected. The different tests of this technique are performed based on NS-2 simulator and the outcomes are compared with those of related on-demand routing protocols dedicated for VANETs. Interesting results are distinguished showing a reduced end-to-end delay and a high delivery ratio, which proving that this heterogeneous communication between vehicles and UAVs is able to extend the network connectivity. \u00c2\u00a9 2018 IEEE.",

      "abstract": "The Bayan Obo Mine in the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region, China, is the largest rare earth ore deposit in the world. The Baotou Iron and Steel Group (Baotou Steel) is in charge of the exploitation. Every year, approximately 12 million tons of ore are transported from the mine to the Baotou Steel factory by rail for dressing and smelting. The transportation of these massive quantities of ore has a large environmental impact. Based on the life cycle assessment (LCA) method, this study explores the environmental impact of the railway transportation of ore from the Bayan Obo Mine. Our results indicate that the environmental impact is primarily due to the marine aquatic ecotoxicity potential (MAETP), the abiotic depletion potential of fossil fuels (ADP fossil), and the acidification potential (AP). The environmental impact of the production of raw materials is much greater than that of the railway transportation. Our sensitivity analysis indicates that environmental impact is most sensitive to changes in the amount of diesel fuel used. The annual greenhouse gas emissions is 52.22 million tons, which is approximately 0.45% of the total greenhouse gas emissions in China in 2017. In particular, the direct emission from this transportation is 1.7 million tons, which is approximately 0.007% of the country's total emissions and 0.3% of Inner Mongolia's total emissions. A comparison of our study and the European Union railway demonstrates that in both cases, the environmental impacts are primarily due to MAETP, ADP fossil, and global warming potential (GWP). \u00c2\u00a9 Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.",

      "abstract": "A mobile robot is reliant on precise and robust localization and mapping for autonomous navigation. For this purpose, sensor fusion techniques are employed to combine measurements of multiple sensor data sources. The well-known Extended Kalman filter is the standard approach to integrate absolute measurements; however, multiple relative measurements, i.e., measured differences between the current system state and a past system state, cannot be directly incorporated into the filter. This paper presents a fusion algorithm for the integration of absolute and multiple relative measurements for localization and mapping of mobile robots. A novel approach exploiting concurrent stochastic cloning and smoothing is introduced for robust inclusion of additional relative measurements. The proposed fusion method is applied to perform simultaneous localization and mapping with sensor data from an IMU, a GPS, wheel odometry, and scan matching of data from a 3D LiDAR. \u00c2\u00a9 2018 IEEE.",

The conventional emitter location systems based on TDoA sensors mitigate errors trying to avoid NLoS measurements, while the proposed method, uses the multipath information to extract the time of arrival characteristic from the environment.

      "abstract": "Recently, many studies have reported on image synthesis based on Generative Adversarial Networks (GAN). However, the use of GAN does not provide much attention on the signal classification problem. In the context of using wireless signals to classify illegal Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs), this paper explores the feasibility of using GAN to improve the training datasets and obtain a better classification model, thereby improving the accuracy of classification. First, we use the generative model of GAN to generate a large datasets, which does not need manual annotation. At the same time, the discriminative model of GAN is improved to classify the types of signals based on the loss function of the discriminative model. Finally, this model can be used to the outdoor environment and obtain a real-time illegal UAVs signal classification system. Our experiments confirmed that the improvements on the Auxiliary Classifier Generative Adversarial Networks (AC-GANs) by limited datasets achieve excellent results. The recognition rate can reach more than 95% in the indoor environment, and this method is also applicable in the outdoor environment. Moreover, based on the theory of Wasserstein GANs (WGAN) and AC-GANs, a more robust Auxiliary Classifier Wasserstein GANs (AC-WGANs) model is obtained, which is suitable for multi-class UAVs. Through the combination of AC-WGANs and Universal Software Radio Peripheral (USRP) B210 software defined radio (SDR) platform, a real-time UAVs signal classification system is also implemented.",

      "abstract": "Multiple unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) team often needs to perform some certain tasks cooperatively. In the process of UAVs performing these tasks, the bandwidth of the communication network will affect the task assignment results, then the problem of task allocation for multi-UAV teams under the condition of limited communication bandwidth is considered. For a target, UAVs need to perform reconnaissance, attack and assessment tasks in coordination. The Consensus-Based Bundle Algorithm(CBBA) requires each task is assigned to no more than one UAV, so this paper extends CBBA by duplicating cooperative tasks to modify the task list and adding a judgment mechanism to ensure the uniqueness of the duplicate tasks' allocation in order to achieve the purpose of allocating multiple UAVs to the same task. At the same time, this paper utilizes a bid warping link to improve the algorithm performance and applies CBBA in asynchronous environment to reduce communication burden. Simulation results show that this improved algorithm is feasible and more efficient to improve the task allocation result for multi-UAVs teams with fewer messages transmission and a larger global reward. \u00c2\u00a9 2018 IEEE.",

      "abstract": "The detection, localization and evaluation of small flooded areas can contribute to decrease the economical damages of such disasters. The cheapest and most accurate method is to segment the aerial images taken from UAV. In this paper, we propose a new method for detection of regions of interest, like flooding in rural areas, using Generative Adversarial Networks (GAN) and Graphics Processing Units (GPU). The classical GPU is used to create, by parallel calculation of textural features, extracted from the co-occurrence matrix, the supervised mask of flood segmentation in the images from the learning set. Based on these images and their associated real masks, the weights of the generator and discriminator are established. A set of 40 images were used for the learning phase and another set of 60 images were used for method validation. The results demonstrate that the proposed method provide a high accuracy and robustness, comparing with other papers for flooding evaluation. Even if it is a relative long time to learn the GAN, in the operational phase the time for image segmentation process is very short. \u00c2\u00a9 2018 IEEE.",

One approach involves solving the Karush-Kuhn-Tucker conditions directly, and the other is based on the alternating direction method of multipliers. In both cases, the problem structure can be exploited to yield distributed computations in the following sense: Construction of the estimate for each sub-system component of the state involves information pertaining to the two immediate neighbours only. Numerical simulations based on model data from an automated irrigation channel are used to investigate and compare the computational burden of the two approaches. \u00c2\u00a9 2018 IEEE.",

      "abstract": "Formations of small satellites are becoming more and more important to many space applications, since they offer the possibility of distributing the payload functionality among the different elements of the formation, so to improve scientific return, providing at the same time a number of advantages in terms of overall system reliability, flexibility and modularity. However, precise autonomous determination of the relative positions of the formation members is required for formation acquisition and maintenance, and scientific objective achievement. For Low-Earth-Orbit formations, this task can be performed exploiting GPS-based relative positioning techniques. The technique exploited in this paper is designed for on board usage. It processes double differenced pseudo-range and carrier phase observables on two frequencies within a hybrid filtering scheme to get satisfactory precision and high robustness. However, relative positioning by GPS is affected by the capability of correctly estimating differential ionospheric delays, and, then, by the status of ionosphere activity. Hence, the filter includes an ionospheric model capable of reproducing ionosphere horizontal gradients with a minimum number of parameters, which can be estimated on the fly. In addition, a robust tuning approach is developed in the paper to get stable filter performance over long period of times. Specifically, the proposed approach combines an empirical tuning technique with a randomized algorithm to get the best filter tuning. Filter performance and tuning approach effectiveness are successfully verified using freely available GPS flight data of Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment mission. \u00c2\u00a9 2018 COSPAR",

      "abstract": "Background: Guidelines on atrial fibrillation (AF) recommend the CHA 2 DS 2 -VASc rule for anticoagulant decision-making, but underuse exists. We studied the impact of an automated decision support on stroke prevention in patients with AF in a cluster randomised trial in general practice. Methods: Intervention practices were provided with a CHA 2 DS 2 -VASc based anticoagulant treatment recommendation. Reference practices provided care as usual. The primary outcome was incidence of ischaemic stroke, transient ischaemic attack (TIA) and/or thromboembolism (TE). Secondary outcomes were bleeding and the proportion of patients on guideline recommended anticoagulant treatment. Results: In total, 1129 AF patients were included in the 19 intervention practices and 1226 AF patients in the 19 reference practices. The median age was 77 (interquartile range (IQR) 68\u00e2\u0080\u009375) years, the median CHA 2 DS 2 -VASc score was 3.0 (IQR 2.0\u00e2\u0080\u00935.0). Underuse of anticoagulants in patients with CHA 2 DS 2 -VASc score \u00e2\u0089\u00a5 2 was 6.6%. After a median follow-up of 2.7 years (IQR 2.3\u00e2\u0080\u00933.0), the incidence rate per 100 person-years of ischaemic stroke/TIA/TE was 1.96 in the intervention group and 1.42 in the reference group (hazard ratio (HR) 1.3, 95% C.I. 0.8\u00e2\u0080\u00932.1). No difference was observed in the rate of bleeding (0.79 versus 0.82), or in the underuse (7.2% versus 8.2%) or overuse (8.0% versus 7.9%) of anticoagulation. Conclusions: In this study in patients with AF in general practice, underuse of anticoagulants was relatively low. Providing practitioners with CHA 2 DS 2 -VASc based decision support did not result in a reduction in stroke incidence, affect bleeding risk or anticoagulant over- or underuse. \u00c2\u00a9 2018 Elsevier B.V.",

      "abstract": "This paper proposes a human-centered risk assessment algorithm designed to find the intervention moment of drive mode and active safety mode while monitoring threat vehicles ahead to overcome effects of vehicular communication on risk assessment in automated driving vehicle. Although a conventional radar system is known to be best fitted on-board ranging sensor in terms of longitudinal safety, it is generally not enough for a reliable automated driving because of sensing uncertainty of the traffic environments and incomplete perception results due to sensor limitations. This can be overcome by implementing vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) communication which provides complementary source of target vehicle\u2019s dynamic behavior. Using V2V communication with vehicle internal and surround information obtained from the on-board sensor system, future vehicle motion has been predicted. With accurately predicted motion of a remote vehicle, a collision risk and the automated drive mode are determined by incorporating human factor. Effects of the V2V communication on a human-centered risk assessment algorithm have been investigated through a safe triangle analysis. The computer simulation studies have been conducted in order to validate the performance of the proposed algorithm. It has been shown that the V2V communication with the proposed risk assessment algorithm allows a faster drive mode decision and active safety intervention moment.",

In cooperative multi-UAV system with mixed and layered structure, the individual of cooperative decision-making can be called Decision-Making Center (DMC). The random fault of individual or interference, deception and malicious attack to the DMC will lead to the instability of the system. Traditional method based on formation leader selecting is feasible in normal environment, but not available when the cooperative system has been deceived or interfered. The existing methods will produce a certain deviation, even the system is deceived or intercepted. According to all of above problems, the ability of decision to provide the DMC has been modeled as its trust value, include trust degree (TD) and reputation degree (RD). Through the information which is interacting between UAVs and using of the Cloud Model to enhance the adaptability of the environmental uncertainty, a new method defined as Dynamic DMC Selection based on Cloud Trust Model (DDMCSCTM) has been built. It can adaptively select the best DMC in environment of deceived and interfered. Experimental results show that it can achieve better effect. \u00c2\u00a9 2018 IEEE.",

In this paper, optimal path planning for forest fire rescue UAV based on vortex search (VS) algorithm is proposed. Firstly, the terrain of the planning space is described by cubic interpolation method. Then, in terms of the solution quality, length and energy, the multi-objective cost function is used in the process of the path planning. Finally, the VS algorithm is applied to compute the optimal path for forest fire rescue UAV. Simulation results show that the VS algorithm has the good explorative and exploitation ability, while the path planned by VS algorithm is smooth, short and passing over the low attitude. \u00c2\u00a9 2018 IEEE.",

      "abstract": "Understanding human motion behavior is critical for autonomous moving platforms (like self-driving cars and social robots) if they are to navigate human-centric environments. This is challenging because human motion is inherently multimodal: given a history of human motion paths, there are many socially plausible ways that people could move in the future. We tackle this problem by combining tools from sequence prediction and generative adversarial networks: a recurrent sequence-to-sequence model observes motion histories and predicts future behavior, using a novel pooling mechanism to aggregate information across people. We predict socially plausible futures by training adversarially against a recurrent discriminator, and encourage diverse predictions with a novel variety loss. Through experiments on several datasets we demonstrate that our approach outperforms prior work in terms of accuracy, variety, collision avoidance, and computational complexity. \u00c2\u00a9 2018 IEEE.",

      "abstract": "Predicting and understanding human motion dynamics has many applications, such as motion synthesis, augmented reality, security, and autonomous vehicles. Due to the recent success of generative adversarial networks (GAN), there has been much interest in probabilistic estimation and synthetic data generation using deep neural network architectures and learning algorithms. We propose a novel sequence-to-sequence model for probabilistic human motion prediction, trained with a modified version of improved Wasserstein generative adversarial networks (WGAN-GP), in which we use a custom loss function designed for human motion prediction. Our model, which we call HP-GAN, learns a probability density function of future human poses conditioned on previous poses. It predicts multiple sequences of possible future human poses, each from the same input sequence but a different vector z drawn from a random distribution. Furthermore, to quantify the quality of the non-deterministic predictions, we simultaneously train a motion-quality-assessment model that learns the probability that a given skeleton sequence is a real human motion. We test our algorithm on two of the largest skeleton datasets: NTURGB-D and Human3.6M. We train our model on both single and multiple action types. Its predictive power for long-term motion estimation is demonstrated by generating multiple plausible futures of more than 30 frames from just 10 frames of input. We show that most sequences generated from the same input have more than 50% probabilities of being judged as a real human sequence.

      "abstract": "In this paper we present a novel framework for geolocalizing Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) using only their onboard camera. The framework exploits the abundance of satellite imagery, along with established computer vision and deep learning methods, to locate the UAV in a satellite imagery map. It utilizes the contextual information extracted from the scene to attain increased geolocalization accuracy and enable navigation without the use of a Global Positioning System (GPS), which is advantageous in GPS-denied environments and provides additional enhancement to existing GPS-based systems. The framework inputs two images at a time, one captured using a UAV-mounted downlooking camera, and the other synthetically generated from the satellite map based on the UAV location within the map. Local features are extracted and used to register both images, a process that is performed recurrently to relate UAV motion to its actual map position, hence performing preliminary localization. A semantic shape matching algorithm is subsequently applied to extract and match meaningful shape information from both images, and use this information to improve localization accuracy. The framework is evaluated on two different datasets representing different geographical regions. Obtained results demonstrate the viability of proposed method and that the utilization of visual information can offer a promising approach for unconstrained UAV navigation and enable the aerial platform to be self-aware of its surroundings thus opening up new application domains or enhancing existing ones. \u00c2\u00a9 2018 IEEE.",

      "abstract": "Pixel-wise semantic image labeling is an important, yet challenging task with many applications. Especially in autonomous driving systems, it allows for a full understanding of the system's surroundings, which is crucial for trajectory planning. Typical approaches to tackle this problem involve either the training of deep networks on vast amounts of images to directly infer the labels or the use of probabilistic graphical models to jointly model the dependencies of the input (i.e. images) and output (i.e. labels). Yet, the former approaches do not capture the structure of the output labels, which is crucial for the performance of dense labeling, and the latter rely on carefully hand-designed priors that require costly parameter tuning via optimization techniques, which in turn leads to long inference times. To alleviate these restrictions, we explore how to arrive at dense semantic pixel labels given both the input image and an initial estimate of the output labels. We propose a parallel architecture that: 1) exploits the context information through a LabelPropagation network to propagate correct labels from nearby pixels to improve the object boundaries, 2) uses a LabelReplacement network to directly replace possibly erroneous, initial labels with new ones, and 3) combines the different intermediate results via a Fusion network to obtain the final per-pixel label. We experimentally validate our approach on two different datasets for semantic segmentation, where we show improvements over the state-of-the-art. We also provide both a quantitative and qualitative analysis of the generated results. \u00c2\u00a9 2018 IEEE.",

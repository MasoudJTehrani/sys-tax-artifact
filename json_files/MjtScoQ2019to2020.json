      "abstract": "Across the globe, remote image data is rapidly being collected for the assessment of benthic communities from shallow to extremely deep waters on continental slopes to the abyssal seas. Exploiting this data is presently limited by the time it takes for experts to identify organisms found in these images. With this limitation in mind, a large effort has been made globally to introduce automation and machine learning algorithms to accelerate both classification and assessment of marine benthic biota. One major issue lies with organisms that move with swell and currents, such as kelps. This paper presents an automatic hierarchical classification method local binary classification as opposed to the conventional flat classification to classify kelps in images collected by autonomous underwater vehicles. The proposed kelp classification approach exploits learned feature representations extracted from deep residual networks. We show that these generic features outperform the traditional off-the-shelf CNN features and the conventional hand-crafted features. Experiments also demonstrate that the hierarchical classification method outperforms the traditional parallel multi-class classifications by a significant margin (90.0% vs. 57.6% and 77.2% vs. 59.0%) on Benthoz15 and Rottnest datasets respectively. Furthermore, we compare different hierarchical classification approaches and experimentally show that the sibling hierarchical training approach outperforms the inclusive hierarchical approach by a significant margin. We also report an application of our proposed method to study the change in kelp cover over time for annually repeated AUV surveys.",

      "abstract": "The reliability and robustness of an integrated positioning system are crucial in the fields of robotics and autonomous navigation. Utilizing inertial navigation systems (INS) with Real-Time Kinematic (RTK) Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) is not sufficient as the integrated navigation performance inevitably degrades in urban areas due to extended GNSS outages. For these reasons, multiple variants of visual odometry (VO) have been developed in hope to correct INS position, attitude, and bias estimates under challenging GNSS environments. However, state-of-the-art visual-inertial odometry (VIO) algorithms lack well-defined uncertainty estimations. The tuning of the noise covariance is done heuristically, which implies that data-dependent tuning is needed to achieve high performance or even convergence of the navigation filters. To tackle this issue, we propose Voronoi Diagram-aided Visual Inertial Odometry (VD-VIO), which makes use of Voronoi Diagrams by exploiting the impact of feature distribution to the end positioning and navigation solution. To model this error, we engineer a feature set specifically designed to provide insight into the VO performance. A multi-layer perceptron neural network (MLPNN) is then adopted to obtain positional and attitudinal confidence metrics, which are then used to adjust the error covariance matrix coefficients dynamically, thus enabling a better correction of IMU PVA and bias errors, hence improving the overall integrated navigation solution in case of GNSS outages. We illustrate the efficacy of the proposed method by showing the VIO/GNSS system\u2019s performance with and without learned uncertainties.",

      "abstract": "In this paper, we quantify integrity for a GNSS-PPP system when augmented with mega-constellation satellites (GNSS-MC). The geometric diversity provided by signals from fast-moving LEO satellites is exploited for rapid estimation of floating valued cycle ambiguities. Further, the improved redundancy provided by mega-constellation satellite signals in addition to GNSS enable e cient fault detection using carrier phase Advanced Receiver Autonomous Integrity Monitoring (ARAIM). The proposed framework assumes that mega-constellation (MC) satellite orbit and clock determination is based on their spaceborne GNSS receivers. We quantify the impact on integrity of GNSS faults, which not only a ect the potential users on earth, but also the spaceborne MC receiver data. Given that GNSS faults can cascade to constellation-wide MC faults, this work determines the conditions where GNSS-MC improves integrity, and quantifies this improvement as compared to GNSS only.\n",

      "abstract": "This paper focuses on demonstrating the design and build stages, and effort done by Systems Engineering students team (DustyTRON NASA Robotics) to develop a mining robot that was used in the 2016 National Aeronautics & Space Ad-ministration (NASA) Robotics Mining Competition (RMC). The objective of the NASA RMC challenge is to encourage engineering students to design and build a robot that will excavate, collect, and deposit a simulated Martian regolith. Mining water/ice, and regolith is very essential task for space missions and resource utilization, they contain many elements such as metals, minerals, and other compounds. The Mining will allow extracting pro-pellants from the regolith such as Oxygen and Hydrogen that can be used as an energy source for in-space transportation. In addition, the space mining system can be used in tasks that are important for human and robotics scientific investigations. The DustyTRON team consists of Systems Engineering students, who are divided into 1) hardware design, 2) electrical circuitry and 3) software development sub-teams. Each team works in harmony to overcome the challenges had previously experienced, such as heavy weight, circuitry layout design, autonomous and user control modes, and better software interface. They designed and built a remote controlled excavator robot, that can collect and deposit a minimum of ten (10) kilograms of regolith simulant within 15 minutes. The developed robot with its innovative mining mechanisms and control system and software will assist NASA in enhancing the current methodologies used for space/planet exploration and resources\u00e2\u0080\u0099 mining especially the Moon and Mars. NASA\u00e2\u0080\u0099s going-on project aims to send exploration robots that collect resources for analysis before sending astronauts. In 2016, only 56 United State (US) teams were invited to participate, and DustyTRON was one of three university teams from the state of Texas, the team placed the 16th in overall performance. This paper will address the full engineering life-cycle process including research, concept design and development, constructing the robot and system closeout by delivering the team\u00e2\u0080\u0099s robot for the competition in Kennedy Space Center in Florida.",

Specific applications such as precision farming, surveying, rescue operations and remote exploration can benefit from such modern and affordable robots, thus helping humans in work-related or daily life. To support such a new generation of service robots and vehicles, navigation capabilities play a fundamental role in mission planning and on-field activities. In parallel, recent developments of ultra-low cost embedded Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS), such as in Android\u2122 smartphones has enabled affordable Location Based Services (LBS) applications and provided an impetus to research into low cost navigation solutions. Modern smartphones come with an advantage of having a ubiquitous network infrastructure with ease of developing interconnected applications and integrated proprioceptive and exteroceptive sensors. Within the framework of precision agriculture promoted by the Politecnico di Torino Interdepartmental Centre for Service Robotics, this work investigates a low-cost navigation strategy for an Unmanned Ground Vehicle (UGV) \u2013 Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) paradigm exploiting a collaborative ranging technique based on Differential GNSS (DGNSS) approach applied on raw measurements exchanged between Android\u2122 smartphones.",

      "abstract": "Manual inspections of glass fa\u00e7ade of high rising buildings are expensive, time-consuming and potentially life-threatening for both inspectors and pedestrians on the street. Advances in machine learning for image/video analysis and availability of affordable unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) with onboard video recording and processing sensors provide opportunities for smart, safe and automatic glass fa\u00e7ade inspections. This paper is concerned with developing an effective solution for recognizing cracked glass panels, which can be installed on board a UAV. From static 2D photographic images, the proposed solution analyzes textural patterns of smooth glass surface and crack segments, linearity of detected crack segments, geometrical characteristics of crack curvatures and the crack pixel patterns, captures these discriminative features for glass cracks using Uniform Local Binary Pattern (ULBP), histograms of linearity, geometrical curvature descriptors with fixed length connected pixel configurations, and accordingly classifies images of cracked and non-cracked glass panels using a kNN classifier. Experimental results with images of different resolutions acquired by a UAV drone in a real office building setting and images collected through Google search demonstrate that the proposed solution achieves promising results with accuracy rates in excess of 80% and even as high as 91% despite the presence of reflections.",

      "abstract": "In this paper, a method based on a Multiobjective Multi-Verse Optimizer (MOMVO) is proposed and successfully implemented to solve the unmanned aerial vehicles\u00e2\u0080\u0099 path planning problem. The generation of each coordinate of the aircraft is reformulated as a multiobjective optimization problem under operational constraints. The shortest and smoothest path by avoiding all obstacles and threats is the solution of such a hard optimization problem. A set of competitive metaheuristics such as Multiobjective Salp Swarm Algorithm (MSSA), Grey Wolf Optimizer (MOGWO), Particle Swarm Optimization (MOPSO) and Non-dominated Sorting Genetic Algorithm II (NSGA-II) are retained as comparison tools for the problem\u00e2\u0080\u0099s resolution. To assess the performance of the reported algorithms and conclude about their effectiveness, an empirical study is firstly performed for solving different multiobjective test functions from the literature. These algorithms are then used to obtain a set of optimal Pareto solutions for the multi-criteria path planning problem. An efficient Technique for Order of Preference by Similarity to Ideal Solution (TOPSIS) of Multi Criteria Decision-Making (MCDM) model is investigated to find the optimal solution from the non-dominant ones. Demonstrative results and statistical analysis are presented and compared in order to show the effectiveness of the proposed MOMVO-based path planning technique.",

      "abstract": "The spread of Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) in the last decade revolutionized many applications fields. Most investigated research topics focus on increasing autonomy during operational campaigns, environmental monitoring, surveillance, maps, and labeling. To achieve such complex goals, a high-level module is exploited to build semantic knowledge leveraging the outputs of the low-level module that takes data acquired from multiple sensors and extracts information concerning what is sensed. All in all, the detection of the objects is undoubtedly the most important low-level task, and the most employed sensors to accomplish it are by far RGB cameras due to costs, dimensions, and the wide literature on RGB-based object detection. This survey presents recent advancements in 2D object detection for the case of UAVs, focusing on the differences, strategies, and trade-offs between the generic problem of object detection, and the adaptation of such solutions for operations of the UAV. Moreover, a new taxonomy that considers different heights intervals and driven by the methodological approaches introduced by the works in the state of the art instead of hardware, physical and/or technological constraints is proposed.",

      "abstract": " Background: The COVID-19 pandemic has caused morbidity and mortality, as well as, widespread disruption to people\u2019s lives and livelihoods around the world. Given the health and economic threats posed by the pandemic to the global community, there are concerns that rates of suicide and suicidal behaviour may rise during and in its aftermath. Our living systematic review (LSR) focuses on suicide prevention in relation to COVID-19, with this iteration synthesising relevant evidence up to June 7 th 2020. \r\n Method: &nbsp;Automated daily searches feed into a web-based database with screening and data extraction functionalities. Eligibility criteria include incidence/prevalence of suicidal behaviour, exposure-outcome relationships and effects of interventions in relation to the COVID-19 pandemic. Outcomes of interest are suicide, self-harm or attempted suicide and suicidal thoughts. No restrictions are placed on language or study type, except for single-person case reports. \r\n Results: Searches identified 2070 articles, 29 (28 studies) met our inclusion criteria, of which 14 articles were research letters or pre-prints awaiting peer review. All articles reported observational data: 12 cross-sectional; eight case series; five modelling; and three service utilisation studies. No studies reported on changes in rates of suicidal behaviour. Case series were largely drawn from news reporting in low/middle income countries and factors associated with suicide included fear of infection, social isolation and economic concerns. &nbsp; \r\n Conclusions: &nbsp; A marked improvement in the quality of design, methods, and reporting in future studies is needed. There is thus far no clear evidence of an increase in suicide, self-harm, suicidal behaviour, or suicidal thoughts associated with the pandemic. However, suicide data are challenging to collect in real time and economic effects are evolving. Our LSR will provide a regular synthesis of the most up-to-date research evidence to guide public health and clinical policy to mitigate the impact of COVID-19 on suicide. \r\n&nbsp; \r\n PROSPERO registration:  CRD42020183326 01/05/2020",

      "abstract": "Aiming at tracking and attacking low altitude, slow and small targets with high power laser, a miniaturized high power laser beam emitting and tracking aiming system is designed to meet the requirements of compact type. In the beam emitting part, the single coude mirror is used to realize the waveguide system of laser beam in pitch direction. The structure is compact, which meets the requirements of miniaturization and reduces the difficulty of realization. In the pointing and tracking part, the tracking dynamic performance is improved, based on the compound-axis tracking strategy and combined with the man in the loop dynamic correction of the coarse tracking residual. The stability of the optical axis of the single coude mirror is better than 5\u03bcrad. The field test results show that the tracking accuracy of the system is 6 \u03bcrad for balloon and 9\u03bcrad for small quad-rotor unmanned aerial vehicle, which verifies the feasibility of the design of beam emitting and tracking system.",

      "abstract": "  Background:  Multi-drug resistant (MDR) Gram-negative bacteria are an emerging threat, both in hospital and community settings. As very few antibiotics are effective against such infections, the need of the hour is a new antibiotic or drug combination which can overcome the effect of extended-spectrum \u03b2-lactamases (ESBL) and metallo \u03b2-lactamases (MBL). A new antibiotic combination of ceftriaxone, sulbactam and disodium edetate (CSE) has recently been proposed to tackle the MDR organisms.   Objective:  Our study was carried out to assess the susceptibility of ESBL- and MBL-producing Gram-negative organisms to CSE.   Methods:  The study was conducted in a tertiary-care hospital in Delhi, India, from February 2017 to June 2017. A total of 179 MDR (85 ESBL + 94 MBL) Gram-negative isolates from various clinical samples, identified by an automated system (Vitek 2) were tested against CSE using the Kirby-Bauer disc diffusion method. Susceptibility to CSE was recorded based on interpretative zone sizes of ceftriaxone as per 2017 Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute guidelines.   Results:  The most common isolate was  Escherichia coli  (76/179; 42.4%) followed by  Klebsiella pneumoniae  (53/179; 29.6%) and  Acinetobacter baumanii  (27/179; 15.1%). The  in vitro  susceptibility of ESBL- and MBL-producing Gram-negative isolates to CSE was found to be 58/85 (68.2%) for ESBL and 37/94 (39.4%) for MBL.   Conclusion:  The  in vitro  susceptibility results obtained for CSE against ESBL-producing organisms is promising. It has the potential to emerge as a carbapenem-sparing antibiotic, active against ESBL-producing strains. Further clinical studies are required to establish the clinical efficacy of CSE against MDR pathogens. ",

      "abstract": "Morphing aircraft are the flight vehicles that can reconfigure their shape during the flight in order to achieve superior flight performance. However, this promising technology poses cross-disciplinary challenges that encourage widespread design possibilities. This research aims to investigate the flight dynamic characteristics of various morphed wing configurations that can be incorporated in small-scale UAVs. The objective of this study was to analyze the effects of in-flight wing sweep and wingspan morphing on aerodynamic and flight stability characteristics. Longitudinal, lateral, and directional characteristics were evaluated using linearized equations of motion. An open-source code based on Vortex Lattice Method (VLM) assuming quasi-steady flow was used for this purpose. Trim points were identified for a range of angles of attack in prestall regime. The aerodynamic coefficients and flight stability derivatives were compared for the aforementioned morphing schemes with a fixed-wing counterpart. The results indicated that wingspan morphing is better than wing sweep morphing to harness better aerodynamic advantages with favorable flight stability characteristics. However, extension in wingspan beyond certain limits jeopardizes the advantages. Dynamically, wingspan and sweep morphing schemes behave in an exactly opposite way for longitudinal modes, whereas lateral-directional dynamics act in the same fashion for both morphing schemes. The current study provided a baseline to explore the advanced flight dynamic aspects of employed wing morphing schemes.",

The management and diagnosis of hepatitis disease is expensive and requires high level of human expertise which poses challenges for the health care system in underdeveloped and developing countries. Hence, development of automated methods for accurate prediction of hepatitis disease is inevitable. In this paper, we develop a diagnostic system which hybridizes a linear support vector machine (SVM) model with adaptive boosting (AdaBoost) model. We exploit sparsity in linear SVM that is caused by <svg xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\" xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\" style=\"vertical-align:-3.1815pt\" id=\"M1\" height=\"11.8174pt\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"-0.0498162 -8.6359 13.3712 11.8174\" width=\"13.3712pt\"><g transform=\"matrix(.013,0,0,-0.013,0,0)\"><path id=\"g113-77\" d=\"M541 160L512 170C485 116 462 88 439 67C411 41 376 35 318 35C272 35 238 37 224 48C207 61 205 85 212 121L290 533C305 611 308 615 391 622L397 650H139L133 622C217 615 221 612 206 533L126 118C111 41 103 34 23 26L17 0H474C489 31 528 124 541 160Z\"/></g><g transform=\"matrix(.0091,0,0,-0.0091,8.294,3.132)\"><path id=\"g50-50\" d=\"M389 0V32C297 38 291 46 291 118V635C234 613 175 595 109 583V556L161 554C203 552 207 547 207 497V118C207 46 201 38 110 32V0H389Z\"/></g></svg> regularization.

After filtering features through the sparse linear SVM, the output of the SVM is applied to the AdaBoost ensemble model which is used for classification purposes. Two types of numerical experiments are performed on the clinical features of hepatitis disease collected from UCI machine learning repository. In the first experiment, only conventional AdaBoost model is used, while in the second experiment, a feature vector is applied to the sparse linear SVM before its application to the AdaBoost model. Simulation results demonstrate that the strength of a conventional AdaBoost model is enhanced by 6.39% by the proposed method, and its time complexity is also reduced. In addition, the proposed method shows better performance than many previously developed methods for hepatitis disease prediction.",

      "abstract": "Oral dysplasia is a pre-malignant stage of oral epithelial carcinomas, e.g., oral squamous cell carcinoma, where significant changes in tissue layers and cells can be observed under the microscope. However, malignancy can be reverted or cured using proper medication or surgery if the grade of malignancy is assessed properly. The assessment of correct grade is therefore critical in patient management as it can change the treatment decisions and prognosis for the dysplastic lesion. This assessment is highly challenging due to considerable inter- and intraobserver variability in pathologists\u2019 agreement, which highlights the need for an automated grading system that can predict more accurate and reliable grade. Recent advancements have made it possible for digital pathology (DP) and artificial intelligence (AI) to join forces from the digitization of tissue slides into images and using those images to train and predict more accurate grades using complex AI models. In this regard, we propose a novel morphometric approach exploiting the architectural features in dysplastic lesions i.e., irregular epithelial stratification where we measure the widths of different layers of the epithelium from the boundary layer i.e., keratin projecting inwards to the epithelium and basal layers to the rest of the tissue section from a clinically significant viewpoint.",

      "abstract": "With the rapid development of wireless communication technology and intelligent mobile devices, unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) cluster is becoming increasingly popular in both civilian and military applications. Recently, a swarm intelligence-based UAV cluster study, aiming to enable efficient and autonomous collaboration, has drawn lots of interest. However, new security problems may be introduced with such swarm intelligence. In this work, we perform the first detailed security analysis to a kind of flocking-based UAV cluster with 5 policies, an upgrade version of the well-known Boids model. Targeting a realistic threat in a source-to-destination flying task, we design a data spoofing strategy and further perform complete vulnerability analysis. We reveal that such design and implementation are highly vulnerable. After breaking through the authentication of ad hoc on-demand distance vector (AODV) routing protocol by rushing attack, an attacker can masquerade as the first-arrival UAV within a specific scope of destination and generate data spoofing of arrival status to the following UAVs, so as to interfere with their normal flying paths of destination arrival and cause unexpected arrival delays amid urgent tasks. Experiments with detailed analysis from the 5-UAV cluster to the 10-UAV cluster are conducted to show specific feature composition-based attack effect and corresponding average delay. We also discuss promising defense suggestions leveraging the insights from our analysis.",

      "abstract": "This paper presents the method to solve the problem of path planning for an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) in adversarial environments including radar-guided surface-to-air missiles (SAMs) and unknown threats. SAM lethal envelope and radar detection for SAM threats and line-of-sight (LOS) calculation for unknown threats are considered to compute the cost for path planning. In particular, dynamic SAM lethal envelope is taken into account for path planning in that SAM lethal envelope does change its direction according to the flight direction of UAV. In addition, terrain masking, nonisotropic radar cross section (RCS), and dynamic constraints of UAV are considered to determine the cost of the path. An improved particle swarm optimization (PSO) algorithm is proposed for finding an optimal path. The proposed algorithm is composed of preprocessing steps, multi-swarm PSO algorithm, and postprocessing steps. The Voronoi diagram and Dijkstra algorithm as preprocessing steps provide the initial path for the multi-swarm PSO algorithm which uses multiple swarms with sub-swarms for the balance between exploration and exploitation. Postprocessing steps include waypoint insertion and 3D path smoothing. The computation time is reduced by using the map generation, the coordinate transformation, and the graphic processing unit (GPU) implementation of the algorithm. Various simulations are carried out to compare the performance of the proposed method according to the number of iterations, the number of swarms, and the number of cost evaluation points.

      "abstract": "A key requirement of autonomous vehicle applications is a reliable, accurate, and robust positioning (aka localization) solution. Key navigation, planning and decision operations cannot happen without dependable positioning. This means that accurate positioning must be ubiquitous - in other words, reliably available at all times and in all places the vehicle is expected to operate. While Global Navigation Satellite Systems (GNSS) commonly provide the basis for absolute positioning, it always suffers from the inherent problem of availability whenever a direct view of enough satellites is not possible. \n\nTo address the failure mode, additional complementary sensors can be added to the overall navigation solution through a technique known as sensor fusion. Sensors such as inertial measurement units (IMUs), cameras, LiDARs, RADAR, etc. can be selected in such a way that the individual shortcomings of each sensor are mitigated, and the overall robustness and reliability are improved. Although current autonomous vehicle applications employ sensor fusion techniques, they tend to rely on highperformance sensors to meet the accuracy requirements. These high-performance sensors tend to induce a much higher cost burden than would be acceptable for commercial production, and therefore make mass autonomy too expensive. \n\nThis paper will focus on the exploitation of the lower cost sensors already available on most modern vehicles. These sensors include low resolution odometry (DMI) and consumer grade IMUs currently used for dynamic stability control and wheel slip detection. A novel approach for combining vehicle speed, steering angles, transmission settings and multiple odometry inputs will be presented along with achievable results while operating under a GNSS denied environment. The test trajectory will mimic a typical parking structure with many corners and short straight segments. The only apriori information required for the filter is the wheel track and wheelbase (separation of wheels). \n\nA 90% performance improvement compared to the stand-alone GNSS/INS solution was observed during GNSS outages up to 30 minutes. Furthermore, up to a 50% improvement was observed when comparing between the multi-odometry vs single odometry outages during the same 30-minute outage condition. Beyond GNSS outage performance, it will be shown how the use of the extra input to the filter can improve protection levels of the positioning system to allow for more frequent engagement of the autonomous navigation system.",

      "abstract": "Early detection of wildfire is critical to reduce the damage caused by delaying fire control within the golden time. A solution for detecting forest fires automatically is a deep-learning-based visual recognition system using autonomous drones. This paper proposes a new lightweight CNN(Convolutional Neural Network) model, called i-FireNet, that achieves increased classification accuracy and generalization performance for real-time detection of forest fire in the embedded computing environments such as drones. To better discern unresolved images of forest fires observed in the existing FireNet, this work presents an improved-FireNet(i-FireNet) CNN architecture by exploiting four novel design techniques, data augmentation, batch normalization, YCbCr pre-processing, and global average pooling. Experimental results show that the proposed i-FireNet increases the classification accuracy by 6.77% compared with the existing FireNet while maintaining its real-time performance in the edge device. Furthermore, the proposed architecture occupies 40% less memory space than the existing one.",

      "abstract": "Compact and low-cost devices are needed for autonomous driving to image and measure distances to objects 360-degree around. We have been developing an omnidirectional stereo camera exploiting two hyperbolic mirrors and a single set of a lens and sensor, which makes this camera cost efficient. This paper presents a new calibration method for this camera. Based on the original calibration method by Mei and Rives, we improve the calibration accuracy by considering higherorder radial distortion, detailed tangential distortion, an image sensor tilt, and a lens-mirror offset. Our method is applied to our prototype and reduces the root mean square of the calibration accuracy by 1.2 times and 2.2 times for the upper- and lower-view images, respectively. The distance error is less than 8% up to objects 14 meters apart, which is improved more than seven times compared to the original method, although the error is still larger than the target value of 5%. We consider that the remaining calibration error is due to distortion of the glass cylinder and a degraded optical resolution. As future work, we plan to make further improvements in the calibration and optical resolution of the prototype. In addition, a rectification method for cylindrically expanded images needs to be developed.",

      "abstract": "Impressive progress in technical characteristics of modern unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV) provides new opportunities for their exploiting in different applications and missions which were impossible earlier. The growing applicability of UAVs is based on high performance of modern computers and latest advances in sensor data processing techniques. \n\nRecent decades modern convolutional neural network (CNN) models have demonstrated the state of the art performance in many computer vision problems seemed to be solved properly only by a human. The study is aimed at developing a deep learning techniques for UAV autonomous navigation in complex environment in obstacle avoidance mode. Such kind of navigation is required for cargo delivery or rescue mission in urban, industrial or forestry environment when global geo-positioning system can be unavailable.\n\nFor navigating in complex environment UAV have to recognize objects of observed scene and to estimate distance for possible obstacle. The proposed technique to solve these tasks exploits deep learning approach for image segmentation and depth map estimation using an image of the observed scene. \n\nThe convolutional neural network model is developed capable to predict depth map of the observed scene along with scene segmentation according the predefined object classes. The proposed neural network architecture is based on generative adversarial model with generative part translating an input color image into an output voxel model. The aim of the discriminative part is to estimate how close the output to real data and to penalize false output. Both generative and discriminative parts are trained simultaneously on the specially prepared dataset. \n\nEvaluation on the testing part of the prepared dataset has demonstrated the ability of the developed neural network model to perform segmentation of unobserved complex scenes containing several objects and estimating depth map for this scene. The proposed neural network architecture provides high generalization ability for new scenes.",

      "abstract": "The EU-funded DIONE project (grant agreement No. 870378) offers an innovative close-to-market (TRL7) solution seeking to improve the traditional methods of agricultural monitoring. The project introduces a cloud-based Software as a Service (SaaS) system architecture, building on a fusion of novel technologies that will support the forthcoming needs of the modernized Common Agriculture Policy (CAP) and the \u201cGreening\u201d perspectives, with an automated area-based monitoring system. In particular, an interoperable and harmonized system is designed, connecting large volumes of Earth Observation data (Satellite, UAV, and in-situ) and user-generated highly precise geolocated data (geo-tagged photos, soil measurements, etc.). DIONE\u2019s system architecture encompasses customized and third-party frameworks, where heterogeneous and multi-source data are stored, processed and managed using Artificial Intelligence (AI) algorithms. These harmonized, curated and open accessed data are then provided as Open Geospatial Consortium (OGC)-compliant, web-service layers (WMS, WFS, and WCS). Furthermore, the proposed solution formulates a scalable, flexible, interoperable, and semantically enriched environment, taking advantage of a Spatial Data Infrastructure (SDI) framework capabilities, whilst allowing an interactive connection among different tools and components through RESTful APIs. Our approach establishes a novel, cloud-based, accurate and inexpensive agriculture monitoring solution, enabling the real-time provision of multi-source data to relevant stakeholders such as Paying Agencies, Policy Officers and Control and Certification Bodies, and other domain experts. The system architecture was formulated exploiting a codesign methodology, aiming to ensure a long-term and sustainable solution. Two large scale demonstration will take place in Lithuania and Cyprus, evaluating the system capabilities in real-life and operational conditions.",

      "abstract": "Security threats to smart and autonomous vehicles cause potential \r\nconsequences such as traffic accidents, economically damaging traffic jams, hijacking, \r\nmotivating to wrong routes, and financial losses for businesses and governments. Smart \r\nand autonomous vehicles are connected wirelessly, which are more attracted for attackers \r\ndue to the open nature of wireless communication. One of the problems is the rogue \r\nattack, in which the attacker pretends to be a legitimate user or access point by utilizing \r\nfake identity. To figure out the problem of a rogue attack, we propose a reinforcement \r\nlearning algorithm to identify rogue nodes by exploiting the channel state information of \r\nthe communication link. We consider the communication link between vehicle-tovehicle, and vehicle-to-infrastructure. We evaluate the performance of our proposed \r\ntechnique by measuring the rogue attack probability, false alarm rate (FAR), misdetection rate (MDR), and utility function of a receiver based on the test threshold values \r\nof reinforcement learning algorithm. The results show that the FAR and MDR are \r\ndecreased significantly by selecting an appropriate threshold value in order to improve \r\nthe receiver\u2019s utility.",

      "abstract": "Autonomous driving highly depends on depth information for safe driving. Recently, major improvements have been taken towards improving both supervised and self-supervised methods for depth reconstruction. However, most of the current approaches focus on single frame depth estimation, where quality limit is hard to beat due to limitations of supervised learning of deep neural networks in general. One of the way to improve quality of existing methods is to utilize temporal information from frame sequences. In this paper, we study intelligent ways of integrating recurrent block in common supervised depth estimation pipeline. We propose a novel method, which takes advantage of the convolutional gated recurrent unit (convGRU) and convolutional long short-term memory (convLSTM). We compare use of convGRU and convLSTM blocks and determine the best model for real-time depth estimation task. We carefully study training strategy and provide new deep neural networks architectures for the task of depth estimation from monocular video using information from past frames based on attention mechanism. We demonstrate the efficiency of exploiting temporal information by comparing our best recurrent method with existing image-based and video-based solutions for monocular depth reconstruction.",

      "abstract": "Object detection is a central theme for many Artificial Intelligence (AI) applications such as autonomous vehicles, surveillance etc. The algorithms providing this capability rely on training data being available in corresponding sensor mode. Having co-located data from multiple sensor modes enhances the detection confidence, but the availability of training data in desired sensor mode is not always readily available, which slows down progress. In this paper, we investigate the ability to translate images from one sensor mode to another, on a single fixed camera dataset, using conditional Generative Adversarial Network (cGAN). Specifically, images are transferred from Electro-Optical (EO) to Infra-Red (IR) images and vice-versa using cGAN models, which are generative models that learn the data distribution in a minimax game setting. To investigate the usability of such transferred images, we apply object detection algorithm on ground truth and transferred images and compare their performance. The results indicate that transferred images match closely to real images and object detection has good performance on transferred images, especially when the object size is large.",

      "abstract": "Detection of military assets on the ground can be performed by applying deep learning-based object detectors on drone surveillance footage. The traditional way of hiding military assets from sight is camouflage, for example by using camouflage nets. However, large assets like planes or vessels are difficult to conceal by means of traditional camouflage nets. An alternative type of camouflage is the direct misleading of automatic object detectors. Recently, it has been observed that small adversarial changes applied to images of the object can produce erroneous output by deep learning-based detectors. In particular, adversarial attacks have been successfully demonstrated to prohibit person detections in images, requiring a patch with a specific pattern held up in front of the person, thereby essentially camouflaging the person for the detector. Research into this type of patch attacks is still limited and several questions related to the optimal patch configuration remain open. This work makes two contributions. First, we apply patch-based adversarial attacks for the use case of unmanned aerial surveillance, where the patch is laid on top of large military assets, camouflaging them from automatic detectors running over the imagery. The patch can prevent automatic detection of the whole object while only covering a small part of it. Second, we perform several experiments with different patch configurations, varying their size, position, number and saliency. Our results show that adversarial patch attacks form a realistic alter- native to traditional camouflage activities, and should therefore be considered in the automated analysis of aerial surveillance imagery.",

      "abstract": "Autonomous driving is a popular and promising field in artificial intelligence. Rapid decision of the next action according to the latest few actions and status, such as acceleration, brake, and steering angle, is a major concern for autonomous driving. There are some learning methods, such as reinforcement learning which automatically learns the decision. However, it usually requires large volume of samples. In this paper, to reduce the sample size, we exploit the deep Gaussian process, where a regression model is trained on small sample datasets and captures the most significant features correctly. Besides, to realize the real-time and close-loop control, we combine the feedback control into the process. Experimental results on the Torcs simulation engine illustrate smooth driving on virtual road which can be achieved. Compared with the amount of training data in deep reinforcement learning, our method uses only 0.34&#x0025; of its size and obtains similar simulation results. It may be useful for real road tests in the future.",

      "abstract": "Stress is regulated by the autonomous nervous system, increasing the sympathetic modulation when a threat is perceived. A multifactorial response usually leads to significant behavioural modifications and alterations on homeostasis and physical and psychological status. Moreover, stress is an emotional response that can lead to psychosocial and psychophysiological adversity. Regarding military population, military operations and combat exposure are important stressors that influence acute and chronic stress response in soldiers, affecting their performance and health. A bibliographic search was carried out between April and May 2019, focusing on recent studies (2013&#x2013;2019) that analysed psychophysiological response, stress, stress regulation, heart rate, heart rate variability, and posttraumatic stress disorder in military population. Autonomic and cardiovascular chronic stress seems to be modulated by experience and previous specific training of each military unit. Physical exercise, music embedded with binaural beat technology, bidirectional sensory motor rhythm training, heart rate variability biofeedback, and transcutaneous vagal nerve stimulation are the main techniques applied to balance stress and to recover body homeostasis. Since military population are usually exposed to multiple stressors, knowing previous training and experience, together with developing techniques to balance stress, is the main practical application in this field of study to balance autonomic and cardiovascular systems.",

      "abstract": "One aspect of the well-being of a military unit depends on its ability to reliably detect threats and properly prepare for them. While a given sensor mounted on a ground vehicle can adequately capture threats in some scenarios, its viewpoint can be quite limiting. A potential solution to these limitations is mounting the sensor onto an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) to provide a more holistic view of the scene. However, this new perspective creates challenges unique to it. Herein, we investigate the performance of an RGB sensor mounted onto a UAV for object detection and classification to enable advanced situational awareness for a manned/unmanned ground vehicle trailing the UAV. To do this, we perform transfer learning with state-of-the-art deep learning models, e.g., ResNet50, Inception-v3. While object detection with machine learning has been actively researched, even on remotely sensed imagery, most of it has been through the context of scene classification. Therefore, it is worthwhile to explore the implications of this new camera perspective on the performance of object detection. Performance is assessed via route-based cross-validation collected by the U.S. Army ERDC at a test site spanning multiple days.",

      "abstract": "The digital twin is among the Top 10 of the strategic technological trends for the period 2007-2019, and it represents a powerful tool for the conservation and enhancement of cultural heritage. It reproduces with \"precision\" a physical asset, thus allowing to investigate its structure and to analyze the deformations that occur over the years. Various techniques have been introduced to obtain high-resolution 3D models. Among these, the Terrestrial Laser Scanner (TLS) is widely recognized as the gold standard to generate accurate 3D metric reconstructions. TLS allows acquiring a lot of data (point cloud) in a fast way, being not in physical contact with the objects of investigation. By integrating the point cloud coming from the TLS with the one coming from the photogrammetric processes based on the Structure from Motion (SfM) and Multi View Stereo (MVS) techniques, it is possible to obtain a complete model of the object under investigation. The Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAV) photogrammetric technique allows to investigate possible elements not detectable by TLS. Both techniques, if well performed, can show comparable accuracies. Data fusion approach, based on multi-sensor and multi-scale integration, was proposed in the present work as the optimal solution to exploit the potential of the various techniques. A high-quality virtual twin from the All Saints' Monastery of Cuti (Puglia) was produced. The resulting detailed 3D textured model was generated by integrating digital photogrammetry with laser scanning data. A discussion on data acquisition procedures, modeling approaches and accuracy of results is provided.",

The one-leader and multi-follower Stackelberg game is adopted to analyze the mutual interference among multiple AEs, and the optimal transmit powers are proven to exist under the existing conditions. Following that, a mixed-strategy Stackelberg Equilibrium based on finite and discretized power set is also derived and a hierarchical Q-learning based power allocation algorithm (HQLA) is proposed to obtain the optimal power allocation strategy of the transmitter. Numerical results show that secrecy performance can be degraded severely by multiple AEs and verify the availability of the optimal power allocation strategy. Finally, the effect of the eavesdropping cost on the AE&#x2019;s attack mode strategies is also revealed.",

      "abstract": "This article aims to focus attention on the threat to domestic law and order posed by the misuse of wearable robotic exoskeletons and exosuits intended for beneficial uses such as rehabilitative care and industrial production. Threats to domestic law and order from the misuse of exoskeletons by rogue users range from creating havoc in public spaces, violent crime and endangerment of civilian(s) to enhanced burglary techniques. Drawing on existing legal-institutional frameworks and law enforcement apparatus, this article conceptualises a general framework for the responsible end use of exoskeletons and exosuits. It calls for proactive inward-looking state strategies to manage the bads of exoskeleton and exosuit acquisition, possession and trade while encouraging good uses. Importantly, this article does not suggest that the legal-institutional mechanisms discussed for managing misuse are the only ones relevant to the issue except as a guide for encouraging further discussion in the area.",

      "abstract": "Change detection methods are frequently associated with wavelength-resolution synthetic aperture radar (SAR) images for foliage-penetrating (FOPEN) applications (e.g., the detection of concealed targets in forestry areas), being a research topic of interest over the last decades. The challenge associated with the design of automated change detection techniques goes beyond performing the target detection. It is also related to clutter suppression aiming at a low false alarm rate (FAR). The problem of detecting targets and removing content in SAR data can be treated as an unsupervised signal separation problem, usually referred to as blind source separation (BSS). Additionally, low frequency wavelength-resolution SAR images can be considered to follow an additive separation model due to their backscatter characteristics. In this context, it is possible to explore robust principal component analysis (RPCA) as a source-separation method for problems in which the mixing model is additive and two-dimensional, as the interest SAR images. This paper presents a change detection method for wavelengthresolution SAR images based on the RPCA via principal component pursuit (PCP), considering the use of small image stacks to explore the data diversity from measurements of different flight headings. The proposed method is evaluated using real data obtained from measurements of the ultrawideband (UWB) very high frequency (VHF) SAR system CARABAS II. The experimental results show that the proposed method can achieve a high probability of detection (PD) values for a low FAR (i.e., PD of 0.98 for a FAR of 0.41 objects per square kilometer). Finally, discussions regarding the use of the RPCA in change detection methods and the diversity gains are provided in the paper.",

      "abstract": "Autonomous vehicle platoon is a promising paradigm towards traffic congestion problems in the intelligent transportation system. However, under certain circumstances, the advantage of the platoon cannot be fully developed. In this paper, we focus on the highway Electronic Toll Collection (ETC) charging problem. We try to let the opportunistic platoon pass the ETC as a whole. There are three main issues in this scenario. Firstly, the opportunistic platoon is temporarily composed; vehicles do not trust each other. Secondly, single vehicle may try to escape from the ETC charging by following the platoon. Finally, platoon members may collude with each other and try to underreport the number of vehicles in the platoon so as to evade payment. To solve these challenges, we propose a blockchain-based efficient highway toll paradigm for the opportunistic platoon. The driving history, credential information of every registered vehicle, is recorded and verified from the blockchain. A roadside unit (RSU) is adopted to distinguish the single vehicle from the platoon and in charge of lane allocation. Additionally, an aggregate signature is introduced to accelerate the authentication procedure in the RSU. We analyse the potential security threats in this scenario. The experimental result indicates that our scheme is efficient and practical.",

      "abstract": "Due to the growing threat of a wide range of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), including consumer micro-drones that are increasingly used for defense purposes, the need to develop active and passive countermeasures against armed and intelligence gathering UAVs has been identified in order to increase force protection, critical infrastructure resilience, and information security. Several counter-drone solutions have been reported. To accomplish the task of UAV localization, in addition to electro-optical detection and tracking, we consider the distance determination as a fundamental task for stand-alone observation stations. Laser Ranging is one of the promising tools and currently widely used in determination of distance to large objects or slow-moving targets. Within the scope of this paper we are going to evaluate the features and limitations, when applying it for performing laser ranging on UAV. As a target, we are using a typical representative of commercial micro UAV. In this paper, we will present theoretical analysis and experimental results of UAV laser range measurements under realistic environmental conditions. Investigations about the laser transmitter signal are included. We are going to describe qualitative results of laser ranging at different operational modes. Research is based on ranging micro UAV from different directions and various distances. To estimate the maximum ranging distance on the limits of our system, we are going to apply an artificial scaled reference target. This target creates the same optical reflectance cross section as our commercial micro UAV with a given distance.",

      "abstract": "Web applications are commonly used to provide access to the services and resources offered by companies. However, they are known to contain vulnerabilities in their source code, which, when exploited, can cause serious damage to organizations, such as the theft of millions of user credentials. For this reason, it is crucial to protect critical services, such as health care and financial services, with safe web applications. Often, vulnerabilities are left in the source code unintentionally by programmers because they have insufficient knowledge on how to write secure code. For example, developers many times employ sanitization functions of the programming language, believing that they will defend their applications. However, some of those functions do not invalidate all attacks, leaving applications still vulnerable. This paper presents an approach and a tool capable of automatically correcting web applications from relevant classes of vulnerabilities (XSS and SQL Injection). The tool was evaluated with both benchmark test cases and real code, and the results are very encouraging. They show that the tool can insert safe and right corrections while maintaining the original behavior of the web applications in the vast majority of the cases. \u00c2\u00a9 Copyright 2020 by SCITEPRESS - Science and Technology Publications, Lda.

      "abstract": "This study explores two hypotheses about human-agent teaming: 1. Real-time coordination among a large set of autonomous robots can be achieved using predefined \"plays\" which define how to execute a task, and \"audibles\" which modify the play on the fly. 2. A spokesperson agent can serve as a representative for a group of robots, relaying information between the robots and human teammates. These hypotheses are tested in a simulated game environment: a human participant leads a search-and-rescue operation to evacuate a town threatened by an approaching wildfire, with the object of saving as many lives as possible. The participant communicates verbally with a virtual agent controlling a team of ten aerial robots and one ground vehicle, while observing a live map display with real-time location of the fire and identified survivors. Since full automation is not currently possible, two human controllers control the agent's speech and actions, and input parameters to the robots, which then operate autonomously until the parameters are changed. Designated plays include monitoring the spread of fire, searching for survivors, broadcasting warnings, guiding residents to safety, and sending the rescue vehicle. A successful evacuation of all the residents requires personal intervention in some cases (e.g., stubborn residents) while delegating other responsibilities to the spokesperson agent and robots, all in a rapidly changing scene. The study records the participants' verbal and nonverbal behavior in order to identify strategies people use when communicating with robotic swarms, and to collect data for eventual automation.",

      "abstract": "What if the passenger of an autonomous vehicle feels an urgent need to modify the route? If that passenger has authority to control the vehicle, he can change the route accordingly. But if the person with that authority is not on board, a passenger might obviously need to introduce an additional stop. He might even need to be transported to a hospital, as he might require urgent medical treatment. It may not appear obvious at first sight, but this is a security issue. If anyone could influence the route of an autonomous car, this may include someone intending to steal it, or to use it for a terrorist attack. So, there are conflicting interests. On one hand side: If the passenger has no opportunity to do anything, he might feel more like an inmate than like a passenger. If anyone could use the interface to an autonomous vehicle in any way, doors are widely open for unlawful purposes. DEFEnD is a project funded by the Federal Ministry of Education and Research investigating the role of information security for autonomous vehicles in a broad context. In a first step, the autonomous vehicle and the stakeholders of the system are characterized by use cases. This will involve identifications of day-to-day scenarios which have to be treated from safety and security point of view. Based on the collection of use cases, safety goals and security goals will be identified, where security goals are considered as sub-cases for safety goals. Thus, most of the functional safety approach (ISO 26262) applies with special consideration for security. Legal aspects concerning safety and security goals will also be considered. In later phases of the project, methods of complete probabilistic analysis supported by suitable tools will be developed, which are specifically adapted for the purpose. This will include extensions to standard techniques like fault tree analysis to consider specific aspects of security. The circumstance, that there is a competition between potential intruders and guardians against intrusion has to be considered. Such phenomena are not easily addressed by standard statistical methods, as - once a cyber security issue is resolved - potential intruders will not use that exploit, but rather search for other ones. This contribution is going to report the results of the first part of the project. The oral presentation will in addition discuss progress in tool development and the treatment of further legal questions concerning cyber security issues of autonomous driving. \u00c2\u00a9 2019 European Safety and Reliability Association.

      "abstract": "Compared with traditional vehicles delivery, unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) delivery can reduce energy consumption and greenhouse gas emissions, which benefits environmental sustainability. Besides, UAVs can overcome traffic restrictions, which are the big obstacle in parcel delivery. In reality, there are two kinds of most popular traffic restrictions, vehicle-type restriction, and half-side traffic. We propose a mixed-integer (0-1 linear) green routing model with these two kinds of traffic restrictions for UAVs to exploit the environmental aspects of the use of UAVs in logistics. A genetic algorithm is proposed to efficiently solve the complex routing problem, and an experimental analysis is made to illustrate and validate our model and the algorithm. We found that, under both these two traffic restrictions, UAV delivery can accomplish deliveries that cannot be carried out or are carried out at much higher costs by vehicles only and can always effectively save costs and cut CO<sub>2</sub> emissions, which is environmentally friendly. Furthermore, UAV delivery saves more cost and cuts more CO<sub>2</sub> emission under the first kind of traffic restriction than that under the second.",

      "abstract": "The unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) emerged into a promising research trend within the recurrent year where current and future networks are to use enhanced connectivity in these digital immigrations in different fields like medical, communication, and search and rescue operations among others. The current technologies are using fixed base stations to operate onsite and off-site in the fixed position with its associated problems like poor connectivity. This open gate for the UAV technology is to be used as a mobile alternative to increase accessibility with fifth-generation (5G) connectivity that focuses on increased availability and connectivity. There has been less usage of wireless technologies in the medical field. This paper first presents a study on deep learning to medical field application in general and provides detailed steps that are involved in the multiarmed bandit (MAB) approach in solving the UAV biomedical engineering technology device and medical exploration to exploitation dilemma. The paper further presents a detailed description of the bandit network applicability to achieve close optimal performance and efficiency of medical engineered devices. The simulated results depicted that a multiarmed bandit problem approach can be applied in optimizing the performance of any medical networked device issue compared to the Thompson sampling, Bayesian algorithm, and <i>&#x03B5;</i>-greedy algorithm. The results obtained further illustrated the optimized utilization of biomedical engineering technology systems achieving thus close optimal performance on the average period through deep learning of realistic medical situations.",

      "abstract": "In recent years, stealth aircraft penetration path planning has been a significant research subject in the field of low altitude combat. However, previous works have mainly concentrated on the path planning for stealth unmanned aerial vehicle(UAV) in 2D static environment. In contrast, this paper addresses a novel real-time path planning algorithm for stealth UAV to realize the rapid penetration, which aims to devise a route penetration strategy based on the improved A-Star algorithm to address the problems of replanning for stealth UAV in 3D complex dynamic environment. The proposed method introduces the kinematic model of stealth UAV and detection performance of netted radar in the process of low altitude penetration. Additionally, POP-UP threats are adopted into three different threat scenarios, which is closer to the real combat environment. Moreover, further combined with the prediction technique and route planning algorithm, the multi-step search strategy is developed for stealth UAV to deal with POP-UP threats and complete the replanning of the route in different scenarios. Furthermore, the attitude angle information is integrated into the improved A-Star algorithm, which reflects the characteristics of the dynamic radar cross section(RCS) and conforms to the actual flight requirements for the stealth UAV. Finally, the improved A-Star algorithm, the sparse A-Star search (SAS), and the dynamic A-Star algorithm(D-Star) are respectively adopted to address the problem of penetration route planning for stealth UAV in three different threat scenarios. Numerical simulations are performed to illustrate that the proposed approach can achieve rapid penetration route planning for stealth UAV in a dynamic threat scenario, and verify the validity of the improved A-Star algorithm which is compared to the other two algorithms \u00c2\u00a9 2013 IEEE.",

      "abstract": "CAV (connected and autonomous vehicle) is a crucial part of intelligent transportation systems. CAVs utilize both sensors and communication components to make driving decisions. A large number of companies, research organizations, and governments have researched extensively on the development of CAVs. The increasing number of autonomous and connected functions however means that CAVs are exposed to more cyber security vulnerabilities. Unlike computer cyber security attacks, cyber attacks to CAVs could lead to not only information leakage but also physical damage. According to the UK CAV Cyber Security Principles, preventing CAVs from cyber security attacks need to be considered at the beginning of CAV development. In this paper, a large set of potential cyber attacks are collected and investigated from the aspects of target assets, risks, and consequences. Severity of each type of attacks is then analysed based on clearly defined new set of criteria. The levels of severity for the attacks can be categorized as critical, important, moderate, and minor. Mitigation methods including prevention, reduction, transference, acceptance, and contingency are then suggested. It is found that remote control, fake vision on cameras, hidden objects to LiDAR and Radar, spoofing attack to GNSS, and fake identity in cloud authority are the most dangerous and of the highest vulnerabilities in CAV cyber security.",

To meet the diversity of urban communication services, it is essential to exploit UAVs&#x2019; potential of mobility and storage resource. Toward this end, we consider an urban cache-enabled communication network where the UAVs serve mobile users with energy and cache capacity constraints. We formulate an optimization problem to maximize the sum achievable throughput in this system. To solve this problem, we propose a deep reinforcement learning-based joint content placement and trajectory design algorithm (DRL-JCT), whose progress can be divided into two stages: offline content placement stage and online user tracking stage. First, we present a link-based scheme to maximize the cache hit rate of all users&#x2019; file requirements under cache capacity constraint. The NP-hard problem is solved by approximation and convex optimization. Then, we leverage the Double Deep Q-Network (DDQN) to track mobile users online with their instantaneous two-dimensional coordinate under energy constraint. Numerical results show that our algorithm converges well after a small number of iterations. Compared with several benchmark schemes, our algorithm adapts to the dynamic conditions and provides significant performance in terms of sum achievable throughput.",

      "abstract": "The problem of impact angle constrained distributed cooperative guidance against maneuvering targets with undirected communication topologies is studied. A novel distributed cooperative guidance strategy is proposed to realize simultaneous attack with impact angle constraint. Firstly, the kinematic equations for the engagement are established. According to the engagement equations, the cooperative guidance problem is divided into two units, which include the cooperation of both impact time and impact angle. Secondly, the guidance algorithm is designed separately for simultaneous attack and dealing with the impact angle constraints. The problem is transformed into a consensus problem via disturbance compensation and feedback linearization technique. The convergence of the guidance algorithm is proven by using the consensus theory. Finally, numerical simulations are presented to verify the effectiveness of the proposed cooperative guidance law. \u00c2\u00a9 2013 IEEE.",

      "abstract": "Wireless body area networks (WBANs) and wireless sensor networks (WSNs) are important concepts for the Internet of Things (IoT). They have been applied to various healthcare services to ensure that users can access convenient medical services by exchanging physiological data between user and medical server. User physiological data is collected by sensor nodes and sent to medical service providers, doctors, etc. using public channels. However, these channels are vulnerable to various potential attacks, and hence, it is essential to design provably secure and lightweight mutual authentication (MA) schemes for medical IoT to protect user privacy and achieve secure communication. A lightweight mutual authentication and key agreement (MAKA) scheme was designed in 2019 to guarantee user privacy, but we found that the scheme does not withstand impersonation, stolen senor node and leaking verification table attacks, and it does not also ensure anonymity, untraceability and secure mutual authentication. This paper proposes a provably secure and lightweight MAKA scheme for medical IoT, called LAKS Non-verification table (NVT), that does not require a server verification table. We assess LAKS-NVT's security against various potential attacks and demonstrate that it achieves secure MA between sensor node and server using Burrows-Abadi-Needham logic. We employ the well-known Real-Or-Random which is random oracle model to prove that LAKS-NVT provides a session key security. In addition, the formal security verification using the widely-accepted Automated Validation of Internet Security Protocols and Applications (AVISPA) software tool has been performed and the results show that LAKS-NVT is also secure. We compare LAKS-NVT's performance against contemporary authentication schemes, and verify that it achieves better security and comparable efficiency. The practical perspective of LAKS-NVT is also carried out via the Network Simulator 2 (NS2) simulation study. \u00c2\u00a9 2013 IEEE.",

      "abstract": "Present work deals with design and analysis of fixed wing aircraft model. Dimensions of aircraft are evaluated considering different factors as weight to be lifted, velocity of aircraft and cruising altitude. Using AIAA rulebook the dimensions of aircraft are fixed. Further the theoretical analysis has been carried out using classical equations for evaluating drag co-efficient with respect to angle of attack and lift co-efficient. The airfoil selection has been carried out by comparing the characteristics of co-efficient of lift, drag and their behaviour against angle of attack for a range of 1\u00ef\u201a\u00b0 to 10\u00ef\u201a\u00b0. Using the theoretical outcomes the behaviour of entire aircraft was observed. Simulation of the aircraft has been carried out using XFLR5 software. The theoretical and simulation outcomes are observed to follow similar pattern for co-efficient of drag against both angle of attack and lift co-efficient. Close correlation has been observed between theoretical and simulation results. Present paper presents a design and analysis validation process for aircrafts used in surveillance applications.",

      "abstract": "<p>In this paper, we propose a new visual tracking method in light of salience information and deep learning. Salience detection is used to exploit features with salient information of the image. Complicated representations of image features can be gained by the function of every layer in convolution neural network (CNN). The characteristic of biology vision in attention-based salience is similar to the neuroscience features of convolution neural network. This motivates us to improve the representation ability of CNN with functions of salience detection. We adopt the fully-convolution networks (FCNs) to perform salience detection. We take parts of the network structure to perform salience extraction, which promotes the classification ability of the model. The network we propose shows great performance in tracking with the salient information. Compared with other excellent algorithms, our algorithm can track the target better in the open tracking datasets. We realize the 0.5592 accuracy on visual object tracking 2015 (VOT15) dataset. For unmanned aerial vehicle 123 (UAV123) dataset, the precision and success rate of our tracker is 0.710 and 0.429.</p>",

      "abstract": "With the latest advances in image sensor technology, cameras are able to generate video with tens of megapixels per frame. These high resolution videos streams offer great potential to be used in the surveillance domain. For ground based systems, gigapixel streams are already used with great effect as illustrated by the ICME 2019 crowd counting challenge. However, for Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs), this vast stream of data exceeds the limit of transmission bandwidth to send this data back to the ground. On board data analysis and selection is thus required to use and benefit from high resolution cameras. This paper presents a result of the CAVIAR project, where a combination of hardware and algorithms was designed to answer the question: \u2018how to exploit a high resolution high frame rate camera on board a UAV?\u2019. With the associated size, weight and power limitations, we implement data reduction by deploying deep learning on hardware to find the relevant information and transmit it to an operator station. The proposed solution aims at employing the high resolution potential of the sensor only onto objects of interest. We encode and transmit the identified regions containing those objects of interest (ROI) at the original resolution and framerate, while also transmitting the downscaled background to provide context for an operator. We demonstrate using a 35 fps, 65 Megapixel camera that this set-up indeed saves considerable bandwidth while retaining all important video data at high quality at the same time.",

      "abstract": "With the popularity of commercial unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), people have easy access to UAV. However, people\u2019s privacy and safety can be threatened if UAV flies at airports, private yards, etc. It is important to be able to detect the illegal UAV accurately and promptly on these vulnerable sites. However, motion blur, occlusion and truncation occur frequently due to fast movement of UAV. It is hard to make correct predictions because of the small size of UAV in images. In this paper, we propose an anchor-free one-stage method for UAV detection. The method eliminates the anchor boxes that are used in most existing detectors, which makes our method simpler and more efficient. We improve the detection accuracy in the following two ways. First, a new multi-scale feature fusion method is proposed to enhance the semantic information exchange between different scales. Second, a reasonable loss function is adopted to increase the proportion of small UAV\u2019s loss. Experimental results validate the effectiveness of our improvements and our proposed detector achieve a superior performance.",

      "abstract": "Emergency response to hazardous gases in the environment is an important research field in environmental monitoring. In recent years, with the rapid development of sensor technology and mobile device technology, more autonomous search algorithms for hazardous gas emission sources are proposed in uncertain environment, which can avoid emergency personnel from contacting hazardous gas in a short distance. Infotaxis is an autonomous search strategy without a concentration gradient, which uses scattered sensor data to track the location of the release source in turbulent environment. This paper optimizes the imbalance of exploitation and exploration in the reward function of Infotaxis algorithm and proposes a mobile strategy for the three-dimensional scene. In two-dimensional and three-dimensional scenes, the average steps of search tasks are used as the evaluation criteria to analyze the information trend algorithm combined with different reward functions and mobile strategies. The results show that the balance between the exploitation item and exploration item of the reward function proposed in this paper is better than that of the reward function in the Infotaxis algorithm, no matter in the two-dimensional scenes or in the three-dimensional scenes.",

      "abstract": "The automated video surveillance has become important due to the focus from government and users for improving the smart nature of the buildings. A system developed for handling this can be used for prison, airport, banks, etc. Though there are solutions for this they fail in situations of mishaps and objects that are hidden that could become a threat to the environment. In this paper a framework has been built using modified K-means segmentation algorithm to detect hidden objects. The framework operates in two phases: phase 1 - modified K-means segmentation algorithm for segmenting the hidden objects; phase 2 - deep convolutional neural network for classifying the hidden object the algorithm selects searched for the approximately optimal value of K and segments the object. The result of the algorithm is given to deep convolutional neural network for classifying the type of object. The algorithm is tested with manually built dataset using Fluke Tis40 Thermal Imager. The experiments were carried out in batches of 50*50 images and the performance of the approach is presented using top-1 accuracy and mean average precision and they are 0.94 and 0.64, respectively. From the experimental analysis, we infer that the proposed algorithm works with precision 0.88 false discovery rates 0.12. Copyright \u00c2\u00a9 2020 Inderscience Enterprises Ltd.",

      "abstract": "Recently, a flexible DROP-IN gamma-probe was introduced for robot-assisted radioguided surgery, using traditional low-energy SPECT-isotopes. In parallel, a novel approach to achieve sensitive radioguidance using beta-emitting PET isotopes has been proposed. Integration of these two concepts would allow to exploit the use of PET tracers during robot-assisted tumor-receptor-targeted. In this study, we have engineered and validated the performance of a novel DROP-IN beta particle (DROP-IN\u03b2) detector. Seven prostate cancer patients with PSMA-PET positive tumors received an additional intraoperative injection of ~\u200970\u2009MBq 68Ga-PSMA-11, followed by robot-assisted prostatectomy and extended pelvic lymph node dissection. The surgical specimens from these procedures were used to validate the performance of our DROP-IN\u03b2 probe prototype, which merged a scintillating detector with a housing optimized for a 12-mm trocar and prograsp instruments. After optimization of the detector and probe housing via Monte Carlo simulations, the resulting DROP-IN\u03b2 probe prototype was tested in a robotic setting. In the ex vivo setting, the probe\u2014positioned by the robot\u2014was able to identify 68Ga-PSMA-11 containing hot-spots in the surgical specimens: signal-to-background (S/B) was >\u20095 when pathology confirmed that the tumor was located <\u20091\u2009mm below the specimen surface. 68Ga-PSMA-11 containing (and PET positive) lymph nodes, as found in two patients, were also confirmed with the DROP-IN\u03b2 probe (S/B >\u20093). The rotational freedom of the DROP-IN design and the ability to manipulate the probe with the prograsp tool allowed the surgeon to perform autonomous beta-tracing. This study demonstrates the feasibility of beta-radioguided surgery in a robotic context by means of a DROP-IN\u03b2 detector. When translated to an in vivo setting in the future, this technique could provide a valuable tool in detecting tumor remnants on the prostate surface and in confirmation of PSMA-PET positive lymph nodes.",

      "abstract": "With proliferation of smart devices and wireless applications, the recent few years have witnessed data surge. These massive data needs to be stored, transmitted, and processed in time to exploit their value for decision making. Conventional cloud computing requires transmission of massive amount of data in and out of core network, which can lead to longer service latency and potential traffic congestion. As a new platform, mobile edge computing (MEC) moves computation and storage resources to edge network in proximity to the data source. With MEC, data can be processed locally, and thus mitigate issues of latency and congestion. However, it is very challenging to reap the benefits of MEC everywhere due to geographic constraints, expensive deployment cost, and immoveable base stations. Because of easy deployment and high mobility of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), air-ground integrated mobile edge networks (AGMEN) is proposed, where UAVs are employed to assist the MEC network. Such an AGMEN expects to provide MEC services ubiquitously and reliably. In this article, we first introduce the characteristics and components of UAV. Then, we will review the applications, key challenges, and current research technologies of AGMEN, from perspectives of communication, computation, and caching, respectively. Finally, we will discuss some essential research directions for AGMEN. \u00c2\u00a9 2013 IEEE.",

      "abstract": "Energy Supply Chains (ESCs) are complex systems made up of numerous suppliers interacting with each other and with the environment. From the complexity of these interdependences, risk scenarios can originate in an unpredictable way, threatening the normal operation of the entire ESC and endangering its supply capability. New methodologies are, then, being developed for carrying out ESC risk and resilience analyses. In this study, we rely on agent-based modeling (ABM) to build a multi-layer ESC model for analyzing its resilience. Every element in the ESC is simulated as an agent implementing basic functions like sending and receiving orders, and production. We simulate different disruption scenarios and recovery strategies to investigate the essential factors influencing the resilience of the overall ESC.

      "abstract": "Background. Critical illness such as sepsis is a life-threatening syndrome defined as a dysregulated host response to infection and is characterized by patients exhibiting impaired immune response. In the field of diagnosis, a gap still remains in identifying the immune profile of critically ill patients in the intensive care unit (ICU). Methods. A new multiplex immune profiling panel (IPP) prototype was assessed for its ability to semiquantify messenger RNA immune-related markers directly from blood, using the FilmArray System, in less than an hour. Samples from 30 healthy volunteers were used for the technical assessment of the IPP tool. Then the tool was clinically assessed using samples from 10 healthy volunteers and 20 septic shock patients stratified using human leukocyte antigen-DR expression on monocytes (mHLA-DR). Results. The IPP prototype consists of 16 biomarkers that target the immune response. The majority of the assays had a linear expression with different RNA inputs and a coefficient of determination (R2) > 0.8. Results from the IPP pouch were comparable to standard quantitative polymerase chain reaction and the assays were within the limits of agreement in Bland-Altman analysis. Quantification cycle values of the target genes were normalized against reference genes and confirmed to account for the different cell count and technical variability. The clinical assessment of the IPP markers demonstrated various gene modulations that could distinctly differentiate 3 profiles: Healthy volunteers, intermediate mHLA-DR septic shock patients, and low mHLA-DR septic shock patients. Conclusions. The use of IPP showed great potential for the development of a fully automated, rapid, and easy-to-use immune profiling tool. The IPP tool may be used in the future to stratify critically ill patients in the ICU according to their immune status. Such stratification will enable personalized management of patients and guide treatments to avoid secondary infections and lower mortality. \u00c2\u00a9 The Author(s) 2020.",

      "abstract": "Detection, Identification and Monitoring (DIM) of hazardous chemical, biological, and radiological material is a critical component to Situational Awareness. Timely generated information just before and following a positive detection will lead to the most appropriate Course of Action (COA). The Technical Cooperation Program (TTCP) orchestrated a series of experiments to understand the operational limitations of new technologies in a Contested Urban Environment (CUE). One of the urban challenges occurred in Montreal, Canada in September 2018 where several technologies including a suite of biological DIM sensors were deployed. The urban environment adds complexity to the already challenging DIM task with potential line-of-sight limitations, changing wind conditions, complex communication spectrum, limited maneuverability, etc. The biological DIM suite deployed at this event included standoff, fixed point, mobile point and sampling, and identification sensing assets. The event revealed that the combination of various types of technologies might increase the overall system effectiveness. BioSense, a standoff technology, demonstrated its capacity to perform bio threat surveillance in urban environments having different constraints: short to long ranges; day and night operation; presence of various background sources; multiple surveillance areas without a deployment site having a line-of-sight on all of them and GPS-denied environment. The dedicated <i>Chemical/Biological (CB) Sensor Data Viewer</i> generated an integrated view of the available information from all sensors in real-time and provided a subset of this information to a central common operating software. The Class I mini UAS was equipped with an optical particle counter and filter collector membrane that was targeted to the appropriate location based on the cloud detected by the standoff sensor; and then, material classification obtained in near-real-time from the standoff spectral Laser Induced Fluorescence (LIF) interrogation was confirmed by simple post-processing of samples collected by the UAS.",

The emergence of rigorous air defense radar net necessitates efficient flight path planning and replanning for stealth UAV concerning survivability and penetration ability. We propose the improved A-Star algorithm based on the multiple step search approach to deal with this uprising problem. The objective is to achieve rapid penetration path planning for stealth UAV in a complex environment. Firstly, the combination of single-base radar, dual-base radar, and BB threats is adopted to different threat scenarios which are closer to the real combat environment. Besides, the multistep search strategy, the prediction technique, and path planning algorithm are developed for stealth UAV to deal with BB threats and achieve the penetration path replanning in complex scenarios. Moreover, the attitude angle information is integrated into the flight path which can meet real flight requirements for stealth UAV. The theoretical analysis and numerical results prove the validity of our method.",

Thus, the automotive industry is shifting from mechanical devices to electronic control devices, and is not moving to Internet of Things devices connected to 5G networks. Owing to the convergence of automobile-information and communication technology (ICT), the safety and convenience features of automobiles have improved significantly. However, cyberattacks that occur in the existing ICT environment and can occur in the upcoming 5G network are being replicated in the automobile environment. In a hyper-connected society where 5G networks are commercially available, automotive security is extremely important, as vehicles become the center of vehicle to everything (V2X) communication connected to everything around them. Designing, developing, and deploying information security techniques for vehicles require a systematic security-risk-assessment and management process throughout the vehicle's lifecycle. To do this, a security risk analysis (SRA) must be performed, which requires an analysis of cyber threats on automotive vehicles. In this study, we introduce a cyber kill chain-based cyberattack analysis method to create a formal vulnerability-analysis system. We can also analyze car-hacking studies that were conducted on real cars to identify the characteristics of the attack stages of existing car-hacking techniques and propose the minimum but essential measures for defense. Finally, we propose an automotive common-vulnerabilities-and-exposure system to manage and share evolving vehicle-related cyberattacks, threats, and vulnerabilities. \u00c2\u00a9 2013 IEEE.",

Firstly, performances of Airbus Zephyr S HAPS (Solar High Altitude Pseudo-Satellite), Tekever AR5 Life Ray Evolution and the AR3 Net Ray medium altitude unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) have been analysed. Then, ECA Group A18 and A9 autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs) features have been presented. The strengths, weaknesses, opportunities and threats (SWOT) approach is applied to position appropriately these UAVs and AUVs in the context of maritime security operations. The need for further investigation in the field is reveiled as well. The analysed vehicles are assets deployed with the Europen Commission\u2019s (EC) COMPASS2020 project and tested over European seas.",

      "abstract": "Maritime surveillance is of critical importance for threat prevention and maintenance of national security and safety. Maritime traffic comprises worldwide navigation of millions of vessels. In this sense, the geostrategic position of Cyprus entails the need for effective monitoring of marine traffic. Remote Sensing is a technique, which enables maritime surveillance by means of space-based detection and identification of marine traffic. The advent of new satellite missions, such as Sentinel-1, enabled the acquisition of systematic datasets for monitoring vessels. Using the Copernicus Open Access Hub service, it is now feasible to access satellite data in a fully automated and near real-time mode and deliver vessel information through a web portal interface. Nevertheless, there is still a great need to understand the full potential of the information acquired from such sensors. In this paper, an overview of vessel tracking techniques using Sentinel acquisitions is carried out. Consequently, vessel detections via space imagery could be authenticated against Automatic Identification System (AIS) data, which provide the location and dimensions of ships that are legally operating in the Cyprus region.",

Unlike previous works, which have focused on exploiting ground- based sensors or narrowed the scope to detecting the density of large objects, here we address the full semantic segmentation of aerial LiDAR and RGBD imagery by exploiting crowd-sourced labels that densely canvas each image in the 2015 Dublin dataset.<sup>1</sup> Our results indicate important improvements to detection and segmentation accuracy with the addition of aerial LiDAR over RGB imagery alone, which has important implications for civilian applications such as autonomous navigation and rescue operations. Moreover, the prototype system can segment and search geographic areas as big as 1km<sup>2</sup> in a matter of seconds on commodity hardware with high accuracy (_ 90%), suggesting the feasibility of real-time scene understanding on small aerial platforms.",

      "abstract": "The unmanned systems have been seeing a significant boom in the last ten years in different areas together with technological developments. One of the unmanned systems is unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs). UAVs are used for reconnaissance and observation in the military areas and play critical role in attack and destroy missions. These vehicles have been winning more features together with developing technology in todays world. In addition, they have been varying with different features. A systematic and efficient approach for the selection of the UAV is necessary to choose a best alternative for the critical tasks under consideration. The multicriteria decision-making (MCDM) approaches that are analytic processes are well suited to deal intricacy in selection of alternative vehicles. This study also proposes an integrated methodology based on the analytic hierarch process (AHP) and technique for order preference by similarity to ideal solution (TOPSIS) to evaluate UAV alternatives for selection process. Firstly, AHP, a MCDM method, is used to determine the weights of each critical factor. Subsequently, it is utilized with the TOPSIS approach to rank the vehicle alternatives in the decision problem. Result of the study shows that UAV-1 was selected as the most suitable vehicle. In results, it is seen that the weights of the evaluation criteria found by using AHP affect the decision-making process. Finally, the validation and sensitivity analysis of the solution are made and discussed.",

      "abstract": "Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) play important role in human life. Today there is a high rate of technology development in the field of unmanned aerial vehicles production. Along with the growing popularity of the private UAVs, the threat of using drones for terrorist attacks and other illegal purposes is also significantly increasing. In this case the UAVs detection and tracking in city conditions are very important. In this paper we consider the possibility of detecting drones from a video image. The work compares the effectiveness of fast neural networks YOLO v.3, YOLO v.3-SPP and YOLO v.4. The experimental tests showed the effectiveness of using the YOLO v.4 neural network for real-time UAVs detection without significant quality losses. To estimate the detection range, a calculation of the projection target points in different ranges was performed. The experimental tests showed possibility to detect UAVs size of 0.3 m at a distance about 1 km with Precision more than 90 %.",

      "abstract": "The underwater environment beyond its natural unique beauties has a great scientific interest as it pertains all fields of marine research; despite this, it has not been adequately exploited for cultural and tourism purposes. Virtual and augmented reality technologies have advanced considerably in re-producing and representing unreachable large-scale environments. To this end, this work presents an integrated interactive framework for exploring the underwater world such as submerged cities, shipwrecks, sunken harbors, diving and marine parks, either in situ via augmented reality, or remotely via virtual reality. Firstly, the designed solution exploits high-resolution visual and range data acquired with state-of-the-art technologies (swath mapping systems, underwater vehicles, unmanned aerial vehicles) and processed through novel approaches to create a synthetic topographic relief basemap and to analyze its geomorphology, as well as the anthropogenic interventions. Secondly, this framework allows to write narrative scenarios and produce interactive VR experiences, through a set of custom tools for multimedia content management. The developed framework, named VIRTUALDIVER, will enable domain experts to design immersive xReality experiences and users to experience environments that are typically accessed only by underwater vehicles in cost-intensive, scientific missions. This will promote the underwater cultural heritage, and natural environment through the development of innovative research, teaching, tourism and creative products. \u00c2\u00a9 2020 by SCITEPRESS - Science and Technology Publications, Lda.All rights reserved.",

      "abstract": "Small unmanned aerial vehicles (SUAVs) are suitable for many low-altitude operations in urban environments due to their manoeuvrability; however, their flight performance is limited by their on-board energy storage and their ability to cope with high levels of turbulence. Birds exploit the atmospheric boundary layer in urban environments, reducing their energetic flight costs by using orographic lift generated by buildings. This behaviour could be mimicked by fixed-wing SUAVs to overcome their energy limitations if flight control can be maintained in the increased turbulence present in these conditions. Here, the control effort required and energetic benefits for a SUAV flying parallel to buildings whilst using orographic lift was investigated. A flight dynamics and control model was developed for a powered SUAV and used to simulate flight control performance in different turbulent wind conditions. It was found that the control effort required decreased with increasing altitude and that the mean throttle required increased with greater radial distance to the buildings. However, the simulations showed that flying close to the buildings in strong wind speeds increased the risk of collision. Overall, the results suggested that a strategy of flying directly over the front corner of the buildings appears to minimise the control effort required for a given level of orographic lift, a strategy that mirrors the behaviour of gulls in high wind speeds. \u00c2\u00a9 The Author(s) 2020.",

      "abstract": "Today, semi-autonomous quadrotors are already available at affordable prices and have the potential to become part of everyday life due to the variety of possible applications. To ensure that people feel safe around quadrotors and to optimize flight times, their size should be kept to a minimum which results in their appearances remaining purely functional. This reduces the possibility of adding anthropomorphic or zoomorphic features that are typically used in order to increase acceptability by conveying the robot's intent or emotion. Constrained by mechanical appearance, other non-verbal communication channels can be exploited instead, in particular robot motion. The application EAVE presented in this paper was developed with the idea to design and evaluate trajectories that breathe life into inanimate, mechanical quadrotors in order to improve interaction in human-robot companionships. It extends our existing quadrotor testbed ICARUS, which is capable of tracking arbitrary trajectories of real and simulated quadrotors that were designed using EAVE. We demonstrate that applying some of the established principles of character animation to the design of quadrotor trajectories opens up the possibility of conveying intent and improving interaction, though the appearance of the quadrotor remains purely functional.",

First, a general attack model is given, which allows us to conveniently model the asynchronous denial of service attacks within measurement and control channels in a unified framework. Then, under a delicate event triggered communication mechanism, a refined switching control mechanism is proposed to account for various attack intervals and non-attack intervals. Furthermore, su_cient conditions are derived for guaranteing the input to state stability (ISS) of the resulting closed-loop system. Finally, a simulation example of unmanned ground vehicle (UGV) is given to demonstrate the validity of the proposed main results. \u00c2\u00a9 2020 Institute of Information Theory and Automation of The Czech Academy of Sciences.

In this study, we proposed use of a new low-cost proximate radio frequency tridimensional sensor \"Walabot\" and machine learning classification algorithms. This pocket-sized device, unlike the remote sensing tools such as unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), is not limited by  ight time and payload capability. It can work flexibly in the field and provide data information more promptly and accurately than UAVs or satellite. Walnut leaves from trees of different nematodes infestation levels were placed on this sensor, to test if the Walabot can detect small changes of the nematode infestation levels. Hypothetically, waveforms generated by different signals may be useful to estimate the damage caused by nematodes. Scikit-learn classification algorithms, such as Neural Networks, Random forest, Adam optimizer, and Gaussian processing, were applied for data processing. Results showed that the Walabot predicted nematodes infestation levels with an accuracy of 72% so far.",

      "abstract": " In this study, we investigated the utility of spectral remote sensing data gathered by a multispectral camera for estimating of vegetation cover in Antarctic vegetation oasis and Arcto-Alpine tundra. The surveys exploiting unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV) and multispectral camera were done in an Antarctic vegetation oasis located at the Northern shore of James Ross Island (Antarctica), and arcto-alpine tundra located in the Jesen\u00edky Mts. (NE Czech Republic,  1 420 m a.s.l.). For the two locations, false colour images of spectral indices (VARI, NGRDI, GLI, RGVI, ExG, NDVI, PRI) were taken and analysis of vegetation types and components of vegetation cover done. Additionally, field research was performed by handheld instruments measuring NDVI, PRI and of selected vegetation components: Bryum pseudotriquetrum, Nostoc commune colonies  (Antarctica), lichens grown on flat stones and boulders (the Jesen\u00edky Mts.). The results show UAV photo surveys and imaging of spectral reflectance indices can be used to monitor vegetation types forming Antarctic vegetation oases and arcto-alpine tundra.   ",

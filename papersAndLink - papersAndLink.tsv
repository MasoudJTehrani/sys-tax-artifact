Research on the modeling method of UAV swarm operation in cyberspace	As a kind of game-changing combat style, the operation of the UAV swarm in cyberspace is characterized by high effective cost and high concealment, which make it play an important role in the future competition of cyberspace. Due to the lack of actual combat experience and high confidentiality of the cyberspace operation and the UAV swarm operation, the modeling and simulation (M and S) of the operation of the UAV swarm in cyberspace is the vital method for planning the UAV swarm system architecture and designing the tactical methods of the UAV swarm. At present, the research on the M and S of the operation of the UAV swarm in cyberspace is just starting from home and abroad, and there is no corresponding modeling method and concrete model. Taken the Integrated Air Defense System (IADS) as the operational object, the guiding ideology of the M and S of the operation of the UAV swarm in cyberspace was researched from the height of the joint operations, which includes the characteristics of the individual autonomy, the group cooperation, the offensive and defensive antagonism and the electromagnetic-cyber the operation. Then, the model characteristic and elements was analyzed, such as the model system architecture, the operational rule and the intelligent algorithm. On this basis, the "action model pool", "operational rule pool" and "intelligent algorithm pool" would be constructed. Afterwards, the modeling method of the operation of the UAV swarm in cyberspace which based the “Rule+ Respond+ Algorithm” (RRA) is proposed, including the modeling framework and main process method of the RRA. The main process included the military concept modeling stage, the operational rules refining stage, the operational rules judgment stage, the action model response stage and the intelligent algorithm solution stage, that the five stages were in sequence, also the main work in each stage was analyzed. At the level of system of system M and S, the modeling focused of the abstraction, extraction and description of the operational rules of the UAV swarm in cyberspace. The description and construction methods of the operational rule are researched, such as the BNF format, the process format, and the operational rules tree graph. Finally, based on the future joint operations, an example of the operation of the UAV swarm in cyberspace is given, then the operational effectiveness is analyzed. The example showed that using nine UAV Swarms to attack IADS in cyberspace would reduce the normal power range of the sensor network by 90% and the warning time by 80.3%.	https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85053479210&origin=inward    https://www.spiedigitallibrary.org/conference-proceedings-of-spie/10835/1083514/Research-on-the-modeling-method-of-UAV-swarm-operation-in/10.1117/12.2504209.pdf	maybe
Mathematical aspects of transit photometry for small UAV detection in video	The pervasiveness of small Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs), due to low cost, ease of control, and portability, opens the possibility of their use in urban environments for illegal or adversarial purposes. Such use includes unauthorized surveillance, reconnaissance, and weaponization. Detecting adversarial UAVs in urban environments is difficult. Urban canyons provide shielding from visibility. The small size of quadcopter-type UAVs limits the number of object pixels available for processing, which reduces standoff detection performance. UAVs fly against a background of ground motion clutter which can mask their motion. One possible solution to small UAV detection in urban environments uses low-cost UAV surveillance platforms, equipped with optical sensors, together with computer vision algorithms to detect adversarial UAVs in video data. In this paper we adapt the astronomical technique of transit photometry to detect small UAVs, operating in urban environments, in video data. Transit photometry, typically used for exo-planet discovery, detects small changes in background brightness due to a transiting object. As the UAV traverses across a bright background region, for example, the vehicle occludes the background and reduces the perceived brightness. This brightness dip may be used to infer the existence of a potential UAV passing across the background. The transit photometry curve, resulting from this brightness dip, reveals information about the traversing vehicle. We investigate mathematical properties of the transit photometry curve and derive a closed-form expression for it. We present numerical results demonstrating the technique on real video data acquired from a small UAV operating in an urban environment.	https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85051846358&origin=inward    https://www.spiedigitallibrary.org/conference-proceedings-of-spie/10668/1066802/Mathematical-aspects-of-transit-photometry-for-small-UAV-detection-in/10.1117/12.2303889.pdf	no
Cooperative path planning for multi-USV based on improved artificial bee colony algorithm	Due to the complex constraints, more uncertain factors and critical real-time demand of path planning for multiple unmanned surface vehicle (multi-USV), an improved artificial bee colony (I-ABC) algorithm were proposed to solve the model of cooperative path planning for multi-USV. First the Voronoi diagram of battle field space is conceived to generate the optimal area of USVs paths. Then the chaotic searching algorithm is used to initialize the collection of paths, which is regard as foods of the ABC algorithm. With the limited data, the initial collection can search the optimal area of paths perfectly. Finally simulations of the multi-USV path planning under various threats have been carried out. Simulation results verify that the I-ABC algorithm can improve the diversity of nectar source and the convergence rate of algorithm. It can increase the adaptability of dynamic battlefield and unexpected threats for USV.	https://www.spiedigitallibrary.org/conference-proceedings-of-spie/10611/106111G/Cooperative-path-planning-for-multi-USV-based-on-improved-artificial/10.1117/12.2285623.pdf    https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85045134070&origin=inward	no
Open architecture of a counter UAV system	Government agencies and military are seeing a rise in drones used for terrorism, destruction and espionage. As recently as a decade ago, UAV technology has been used only by US military. Today, dozens of countries manufacture and operate military-grade drones. Drone technology has been made available around the world. Anyone can purchase a drone from an online retailer. Western military operations as well as critical infrastructure protection agencies experienced multiple drone incidents in the last years, ranging from the use of weaponized drones by ISIS to drones flying over airports or drones breaching airspace of other critical infrastructure. The emergence of threats caused by unfriendly or hostile drones requires a proactive drone detection in order to decide on appropriate defence actions. In this contribution, an open architecture of a UAV detection system including decision support for counter-action is presented. The system is composed of multiple deployable sensor stations, an operation center comprising the operational picture display and the decision support component, and a communication bus consisting of a message-oriented middleware connecting the sub-systems and components. The architectural design specifies the sub-systems, their constitutive components, the information and control flow between the components, the protocols used for data and information exchange, the functionality and responsibility of each component, and the functional parameters. The designed architecture provides a blueprint for a UAV detection and defence actions decision-making system which will allow public protection agencies and military to react timely against threats caused by hostile drones.	https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85049209792&origin=inward    https://www.spiedigitallibrary.org/conference-proceedings-of-spie/10651/1065106/Open-architecture-of-a-counter-UAV-system/10.1117/12.2305606.pdf	no
Survivability: a hierarchical fuzzy logic layered model for threat management of unmanned ground vehicles	Survivability has always been of interest in the defense of any armored vehicles. There has been many reports and papers on the survivability of U.S. Army ground vehicles. A Survivability severity model can be best described as the analogy to the layers of an onion, in which each layer of onion describes a different severity level and the phase of threat detected and severity to apply countermeasures. The objective of this paper is to suggest an evaluation tool that contains an algorithm and procedure for the reliability of manned and unmanned ground vehicles. A decision-making system is proposing for the theoretical survivability and is calculated from a threat level in the form of severity. A generic framework algorithm, consists of both linear and non-linear vehicle dynamics systems, and is included in this paper, which consists of the Fuzzy approach and various scenarios, based on straight path projection. Further, to increase the level of rigor, a layered fuzzy control system using various vehicle dynamics parameters [1] and a methodology for designing an adaptive hierarchical fuzzy model [2] and to accommodate various system parameters dependencies, are describing in this paper as a part of the survivability model. It is hoped that different users will tailor this evaluation tool and used extensively by various research workers working in different area. Several probabilistic cases were included in this paper and implemented by converting to linguistic fuzzy parameters to evaluate the algorithm. A simulation model is designed using supervisory fuzzy rule set and several simulation studies have been done which illustrate the effectiveness of the given approach. The result is a robust d flexible control system.	https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85050801757&origin=inward    https://www.spiedigitallibrary.org/conference-proceedings-of-spie/10643/106430W/Survivability--a-hierarchical-fuzzy-logic-layered-model-for-threat/10.1117/12.2304990.pdf	maybe
Factor analysis in automated face detection: gender, occlusion, eyewear, brightness, contrast, and focus measure	Computer-based facial recognition algorithms exploit the unique characteristics of faces in images. However, in non-cooperative situations these unique characteristics are often disturbed. In this study, we examine the effect of six different factors on face detection in an unconstrained imaging environment: image brightness, image contrast, focus measure, eyewear, gender, and occlusion. The aim of this study is twofold: first, to quantify detection rates of conventional Haar cascade algorithms across these six factors; and second, to propose methods for automatically labeling datasets whose size prohibits manual labeling. First, we manually classify a uniquely challenging dataset comprising 9,688 images of passengers in vehicles acquired from a roadside camera system. Next, we quantify how each of the aforementioned factors affect face detection on this dataset. Of the six factors studied, occlusion had the most significant impact, resulting in a 54% decrease in detection rate between unoccluded and severely occluded faces in our unique dataset. Finally, we provide a methodology for data analytics of large datasets where manual labeling of the whole dataset is not possible.	https://www.spiedigitallibrary.org/conference-proceedings-of-spie/10652/1065203/Factor-analysis-in-automated-face-detection--gender-occlusion-eyewear/10.1117/12.2311281.pdf    https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85049184118&origin=inward	no
UAV-based LiDAR and gamma probe with real-time data processing and downlink for survey of nuclear disaster locations	One of the greatest dangers for first-responders when approaching a disaster site is their lack of incident-related information. This problem can be overcome by deploying and operating a range of high-performance sensors mounted on an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV). For an initial survey and subsequently detailed reconnaissance of disaster areas where radiation sources represent a threat for rescue operations, the following specialized equipment can be used: the RIEGL VUX-1UAV laser scanner, a highly sensitive gamma radiation probe provided by CBRN Protection and the RiCOPTER-M UAV. An embedded processing and radio communication system integrated onboard the UAV enables real-time access to georeferenced 3D LiDAR pointclouds and gamma radiation levels. Precise localization of the gamma radiation sources and simulation of corresponding radiation activity patterns is achieved by automatic processing on the ground, taking the up-to-date topography into account. The results are displayed to the person in charge of response forces in an intuitive and user-friendly way on, e.g., a tablet computer in real-time and while the UAV is still in the air. Resolution and precision are continuously increased by a semi-autonomous flight path generation approach. This takes into account real-time radiation measurements in order to fly additional lines over automatically detected locations of specific interest. We present results of extended field tests with live radiation sources to demonstrate real-time data acquisition, processing, and refinement. The system shown represents a highly flexible and possibly life-saving asset for first-responders in time-critical scenarios.	https://www.spiedigitallibrary.org/conference-proceedings-of-spie/10629/106290C/UAV-based-LiDAR-and-gamma-probe-with-real-time-data/10.1117/12.2304353.pdf    https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85049369660&origin=inward	no

An architecture for sensor modular autonomy for counter-UAS	This paper discusses a modular system architecture for detection, classification and localisation of Unmanned Aerial System (UAS) targets, consisting of intelligent Autonomous Sensor Modules (ASMs), a High-Level Decision Making Module (HLDMM), a middleware integration layer and an end-user GUI, under the previously-reported SAPIENT framework. This enables plug and play sensor integration and autonomous fusion, including prediction of the trajectory of the vehicle for sensor cueing, multi-modal sensor fusion and target hand-off.<p>  </p> The SAPIENT Counter-UAS (C-UAS) system was successfully demonstrated in a live trial against a range of UAS targets flown in a variety of attack trajectories, using radar and Electro-Optic (EO) C-UAS ASMs. In addition, the trial also demonstrated the use of synthetic sensors, on their own and in combination with real sensors. Outputs of all the available sensors were tracked and fused by the Cubica SAPIENT HLDMM which then steered narrow field-of-view cameras onto the predicted 3D position of the UAS. The operator was provided with a map-based view showing alerts and tracks to provide situational awareness, together with snapshots from the EO sensor and video feeds from the steerable narrow field of view cameras. <p>  </p>This demonstrates an effective C-UAS system operating entirely autonomously, with autonomous detection, localisation, classification, tracking, fusion and sensor management, leading to “eyes on” the aerial threat, and all happening with zero operator intervention and in real-time.	https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85057377098&origin=inward    https://www.spiedigitallibrary.org/conference-proceedings-of-spie/10802/108020D/An-architecture-for-sensor-modular-autonomy-for-counter-UAS/10.1117/12.2326802.pdf	no

Evaluation of side-scan sonar performance for the detection of naval mines	Autonomous Underwater Vehicles (AUVs) equipped with high-resolution side-scan sonars (SSS) are used to carry out preliminary surveys of potentially hazardous areas in order to counter the threat posed by naval mines and reduce risk to personnel. The detection and classification of mine-like objects is conducted offline, after a scan has been completed while the actual identification and neutralization of potential targets is executed in a separate minehunting operation. In this paper the various influences on the imaging sonar system and, moreover, the resulting sonar imagery are assessed with regard to affecting the Probability of Detection and Classification (PDC). Image quality, sharpness and Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR) are among the more obvious and straightforwardly quantifiable factors. The complexity of a sonar image, however, can have a significant impact as well. Image lacunarity is used to characterize the seafloor in order to assess the corresponding minehunting difficulty. Additional factors under consideration are the heading angle of the AUV at any given measurement position as well as horizontal spreading and potential overlapping of successive sonic pulses.	https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85057312521&origin=inward    https://www.spiedigitallibrary.org/conference-proceedings-of-spie/10794/107940J/Evaluation-of-side-scan-sonar-performance-for-the-detection-of/10.1117/12.2325642.pdf	no

Detection of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV) in urban environments	The detection and tracking of UAV’s is a critical task for public and military security. The main are the low flight height and the small radar cross section (RCS). The problems increase in an urban environment with many high buildings, especially when tall buildings block the line of sight. A new concept of distributed radar sensors was developed to close this gap. To reduce the impact of radar shadows in urban canyons, a surveillance grid of optical and radar sensors is necessary which covers the complete urban environment. The radar sensors build up different security sectors and monitor all access routes for attacking UAVs. Sophisticated cameras which offer night vision capabilities complete the sensor network to reduce the false alarm rate through these regular, declared UAV flights. Cameras allow the integration of a man in the loop which has the final responsibility to define a target as a threat or not. The system supports the operator with a database which based on optical and radar signature of most commercially available UAV’s.	https://www.spiedigitallibrary.org/conference-proceedings-of-spie/10799/107990R/Detection-of-unmanned-aerial-vehicles-UAV-in-urban-environments/10.1117/12.2325637.pdf    https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85079283693&origin=inward	no
A graph-theoretic understanding of network-wide implications of local cyber protections for mission assurance	Modern Department of Defense mission systems are very complex and therefore arduous to defend, especially in the cyber domain. A major cause for this concern arises from the fact that implementation of security protections occur at a local scale, while the important operational security issues stem from a global perspective of the system, e.g., mission assurance. Being able to understand network-wide implications of local cyber protections has the potential to significantly impact the strategies we use to protect modern mission systems. In this work, we present a graph-theoretic perspective on this problem, which is based on a framework for modeling and assessing the integrated cyber-physical dynamics of complex systems. Under the framework, these dynamics (and their relationships) are modeled as a graph and then analyzed using processing techniques from graphtheory. We demonstrate the utility of this framework by conducting insider-attack threat analysis and show how the application of security protections at a local scale impact network-wide security properties from an insider perspective. As a test case, we study the problem of search and rescue (SAR) using unmanned aerial vehicle teams. Unmanned vehicle teams engaged in SAR are prototypical cyber-physical systems, in which local intrusions may cause global disruptions. Here, we describe how the insider modeling framework for cyber-physical dynamics applies to this problem and present results of a network-wide assessment of security properties of the system. We use this assessment to design a security protection for the system in which we use cryptographically secure computation techniques to limit the amount of information sharing required between system components without degrading the correct operation of the system. We show how the application of these techniques on a local scale impacts the security properties of the system on a global scale.	https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85049352433&origin=inward    https://www.spiedigitallibrary.org/conference-proceedings-of-spie/10630/106300G/A-graph-theoretic-understanding-of-network-wide-implications-of-local/10.1117/12.2305957.pdf	maybe
Efficient structure from motion on large scenes using UAV with position and pose information	In this paper, we exploit prior information from global positioning systems and inertial measurement units to speed up the process of large scene reconstruction from images acquired by Unmanned Aerial Vehicles. We utilize weak pose information and intrinsic parameter to obtain the projection matrix for each view. As compared to unmanned aerial vehicles' flight altitude, topographic relief can usually be ignored, we assume that the scene is flat and use weak perspective camera to get projective transformations between two views. Furthermore, we propose an overlap criterion and select potentially matching view pairs between projective transformed views. A robust global structure from motion method is used for image based reconstruction. Our real world experiments show that the approach is accurate, scalable and computationally efficient. Moreover, projective transformations between views can also be used to eliminate false matching.	https://www.spiedigitallibrary.org/conference-proceedings-of-spie/10615/106153F/Efficient-structure-from-motion-on-large-scenes-using-UAV-with/10.1117/12.2304782.pdf    https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85046403020&origin=inward	no
Persistent surveillance with small Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (sUAV): a feasibility study	In typical Intelligence Surveillance and Reconnaissance (ISR) missions, persistent surveillance is commonly defined as the exercise of automatic intelligence discovery by monitoring a wide area coverage at a high altitude leveraging an aerial platform (manned or unmanned). It can be large enough to carry a matrix of high resolution cameras and a rack of high performance computing images processing and exploitation units (PEU). The majority of the small unmanned aerial vehicles (sUAV) are able to carry optics payloads, allowing them to take aerial images from strategic viewpoints. This capability constitutes a key enabler for an immense number of applications, such as crowd monitoring, search and rescue, surveillance scenario, industrial inspection and so on. The constrained onboard processing power in addition to the strict limit in the flying time of sUAV are amongst the serious challenges that have to be overcome to enable a cost effective persistent surveillance based on sUAV platforms. In this paper, we conduct a feasibility study for developing a potential sUAV based persistent surveillance system with tethered power supply.	https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85057397434&origin=inward    https://www.spiedigitallibrary.org/conference-proceedings-of-spie/10796/107960K/Persistent-surveillance-with-small-Unmanned-Aerial-Vehicles-sUAV--a/10.1117/12.2326693.pdf	no

The development of counter-unmanned aerial vehicle technologies	Unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) today play an increasing role in many public missions such as border surveillance, wildlife surveys, military training, weather monitoring, local law enforcement and so on. Due to its advantages such as low life-cycle costs and fewer restrictions on use, UAV has become important military weapon, then Counter-Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (CUAV) technology also become a research focus. Small drones that are not easily detectable have become an emerging threat. Low-cost and effective counter-UAV methods are explored for many countries. The CUAV technologies include traditional air defense weapon system, electronic warfare, UAV, laser weapons and so on. With the development of high-power lasers and continuous advances in beam control technology, CUAV laser weapons will become more practical.	https://www.spiedigitallibrary.org/conference-proceedings-of-spie/10835/108351O/The-development-of-counter-unmanned-aerial-vehicle-technologies/10.1117/12.2505628.pdf    https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85053474888&origin=inward	yes
A high-resolution ground moving target imaging method based on motion compensation	Imaging and parameter estimation of moving targets in airborne single-antenna high-resolution synthetic aperture radar (SAR) system is affected by motion errors, which cause defocusing and dislocation of moving targets. Motion errors derive from platform flight deviation and unknown target velocity and estimating all motion errors once is difficult because both aspects influence each other, especially in unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) systems. We find that the platform flight deviation has the same effect on stationary targets and moving ones. Exploiting this similarity, we propose a novel ground moving target motion compensation method. Platform flight errors are extracted from stationary targets by autofocus algorithms and compensated for moving targets. And then Hough transform (HT) and Map-Drift (MD) technique is used to estimate the radial velocity and the along-track velocity, and range cell migration correction (RCMC) is completed by estimated velocities. Furthermore, PGA technique is adopted to estimate and correct residual phase errors. The effectiveness of the proposed algorithm is validated by the real data.	https://www.spiedigitallibrary.org/conference-proceedings-of-spie/10835/108351E/A-high-resolution-ground-moving-target-imaging-method-based-on/10.1117/12.2505135.pdf    https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85053441699&origin=inward	no

Infrared search and track performance estimates for detection of commercial unmanned aerial vehicles	Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) have become more readily available in the past 5 years and are proliferating rapidly. New aviation regulations are accelerating the use of UAVs in many applications. As a result, there are increasing concerns of potential air threats in situational environments including commercial airport security and drug trafficking. In this study, radiometric signatures of commercially available miniature UAVs is determined for long-wave infrared (LWIR) bands in both clear sky and partial cloudy conditions. Results are presented that compare LWIR performance estimates for the detection of commercial UAVs via infrared search and track (IRST) systems with two candidate sensors.	https://www.spiedigitallibrary.org/conference-proceedings-of-spie/10625/106250Y/Infrared-search-and-track-performance-estimates-for-detection-of-commercial/10.1117/12.2305559.pdf    https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85048117216&origin=inward	no
Scanning LiDAR for airfield damage assessment	The ability to rapidly assess damage to military infrastructure after an attack is the object of ongoing research. In the case of runways, sensor systems capable of detecting and locating craters, spall, unexploded ordinance, and debris are necessary to quickly and efficiently deploy assets to restore a minimum airfield operating surface. We describe measurements performed using two commercial, robotic scanning LiDAR systems during a round of testing at an airfield. The LiDARs were used to acquire baseline data and to conduct scans after two rounds of demolition and placement of artifacts for the entire runway. Configuration of the LiDAR systems was sub-optimal due to availability of only two platforms for placement of sensors on the same side of the runway. Nevertheless, results prove that the spatial resolution, accuracy, and cadence of the sensors is sufficient to develop point cloud representations of the runway sufficient to distinguish craters, debris and most UXO. Location of a complementary set of sensors on the opposite side of the runway would alleviate the observed shadowing, increase the density of the registered point cloud, and likely allow detection of smaller artifacts. Importantly, the synoptic data acquired by these static LiDAR sensors is dense enough to allow registration (fusion) with the smaller, denser, targeted point cloud data acquired at close range by unmanned aerial systems. The paper will also discuss point cloud manipulation and 3D object recognition algorithms that the team is developing for automatic detection and geolocation of damage and objects of interest.	https://www.spiedigitallibrary.org/conference-proceedings-of-spie/10646/106461A/Scanning-LiDAR-for-airfield-damage-assessment/10.1117/12.2305377.pdf    https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85049216982&origin=inward	no
Flexible human-definable automatic behavior analysis for suspicious activity detection in surveillance cameras to protect critical infrastructures	Surveillance systems are essential for the protection of military compounds and critical infrastructures. Automatic recognition of suspicious activities can augment human operators to find relevant threats. Common solutions for behavior analysis or action recognition require large amounts of training data. However, suspicious activities and threats are rare events, and the modus operandi of enemies may suddenly change, which makes it unrealistic to obtain sufficient training data in realistic situations. Therefore, we developed a demonstrator for the recognition of suspicious activity that allows users to easily define new alerts based on their expert knowledge. We developed basic modules for the computation of object detections, tracking and action recognition to generate features. The user is able to specify complex behavior with Symbols and Sentences. Symbols are low-level descriptions to analyze combinations of features. An example of a symbol is ‘approach_gate’, which consists of three conditions related to: the distance to the gate, the speed of a person and whether a person is on the compound. Sentences are high-level descriptions to analyze temporal ordering. An example of a sentence with temporal ordering is ‘entering the compound’, which consists of first approaching the gate, then entering the gate, and finally being on the compound. The demonstrator is compliant with the SAPIENT architecture, which uses multiple low-level Autonomous Sensor Modules (ASM) and a High-Level Decision Making Module (HLDMM). Features and symbols are computed in an ASM and sentences are computed in the HLDMM. Our demonstrator is tested on a multi-camera dataset to recognize suspicious behavior (e.g., digging for placement of improvised explosive devices, climbing over a fence, approaching the compound, and car standing on the road), allowing the user to interactively creates and modifies both symbols and sentences to mitigate new threats that were not implemented during design time.	https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85057423651&origin=inward    https://www.spiedigitallibrary.org/conference-proceedings-of-spie/10802/108020N/Flexible-human-definable-automatic-behavior-analysis-for-suspicious-activity-detection/10.1117/12.2325454.pdf	no
HERACLES: EU-backed multinational project on cultural heritage preservation	In 2016, the European Unions’ Research and Innovation program Horizon 2020 launched the multi-national project called HEritage Resiliance Against CLimatic Events on Site (HERACLES). The goal of this project is to design, validate and promote effective and sustainable solutions against potential threats climatic changes can bring about on the cultural heritage. For this purpose, knowledge and experiences of multiple research facilities and versatile groups of end-users in different European countries will be bundled and synergetically benefited of. In this paper, we will provide an overview about HERACLES project while a particular focus will be put on the activities concerning close-range Remote Sensing data processing. By exploiting image and laser data acquired from UAVs and from the ground, we strive for precise and reliable 3D models that are useful for representation of the scene on the desired level of detail and thus for assessing potential damages and estimating risks. From oblique UAV-borne imagery, we will obtain textured airborne 3D models using photogrammetric methods of image alignment, dense point cloud reconstruction, meshing and texturing. To provide coverage for the objects’ interiors, very dense point clouds from terrestrial laser scans can be additionally captured. A triangle mesh is obtained from these points and textured by means of terrestrial high-resolution photos, whereby the registration took place using a point-based method. We identified two main challenges: first, the reconstruction results from high-resolution UAV images were not always satisfying due to a low coverage; to cope with this, extensive interactive corrections must be undertaken. Moreover, seamless merging of triangle meshes provided by aerial photogrammetric reconstruction and by terrestrial laser scans is cumbersome because of varying density and accuracy of 3D points in both meshes.	https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85057320558&origin=inward    https://www.spiedigitallibrary.org/conference-proceedings-of-spie/10790/107900D/HERACLES-EU-backed-multinational-project-on-cultural-heritage-preservation/10.1117/12.2324661.pdf	no

Removing the bottleneck: utilizing autonomy to manage multiple UAS sensors from inside a cockpit	The U.S. Army Aviation Development Directorate, in collaboration with United Technologies Research Center and University of California: Santa Barbara, has developed a system for controlling multiple unmanned aerial systems (UAS) from a manned helicopter cockpit. Similar manned-unmanned teaming (MUM-T) capabilities have been successfully fielded in the AH-64E attack helicopter, with the Copilot/Gunner (CPG) managing one UAS; however, managing multiple UAS in the same manner would result in a cognitive processing bottleneck within the CPG. Removing this bottleneck requires implementation of autonomous behaviors and human-centered design principles to avoid detracting from the CPG’s primary mission. This research evaluates these concepts with respect to multi-UAS MUM-T performance. Sixteen U.S. Army aviators with MUM-T experience participated in the experiment. The first phase assessed the performance of a CPG managing multiple UAS simultaneously in a fixed-base MUM-T simulator featuring touchscreen displays, simulated aided target recognition, and task-level delegation of control (DelCon). The second phase iteratively improved the DelCon capability and added an Attention Allocation Aid (AAA) in the form of real-time gaze tracking feedback. The research demonstrated that a single crewmember can manage at least three UAS assets while executing complex multi- UAS MUM-T tactical missions. The DelCon capability allowed participants to more efficiently perform a subset of mission tasks. Furthermore, subjective ratings from the participants indicated a willingness to accept the AAA and DelCon systems. Overall, this research demonstrates the potential of utilizing automation and human-centered design principles to overcome cognitive bottlenecks and achieve greater system efficiency.	https://www.spiedigitallibrary.org/conference-proceedings-of-spie/10640/106400L/Removing-the-bottleneck--utilizing-autonomy-to-manage-multiple-UAS/10.1117/12.2303915.pdf    https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85050800132&origin=inward	no
Ladar data generation fused with virtual targets and visualization for small drone detection system	For detection of a small target using electro-optical systems, multi-band 2D image sensors are used such as visible, NIR, MWIR, and LWIR. However, 2D imaging systems are not capable to detect a very small target and they are also not capable of calculating target 3D position coordinates to develop the strategic counter method. 3D sensors (e.g. Lidar, RGBD and stereo camera) are utilized to control unmanned vehicles for detecting threats and response for specific situations. Conventional Lidar systems are unable to detect small drone threat at distances higher than their maximum detecting range of 100 ∼ 120 meters. To overcome this limitation, laser radar (LADAR) systems are being developed, which allow the detection at distances up to 2 kilometers. In the development of LADAR, it is difficult to acquire datasets that contain cases of long distant targets. In this study, a fusion data generation with virtual targets technique based on minimum real LADAR initial map dataset is proposed, and precise small target detection method using voxel-based clustering and classification are studied. We present the process of data fusion generation and the experimental results for a small target detection. The presented approach also includes effective visualization of high-resolution 3D data and the results of small target detection in real time. This study is expected to contribute to the optimization of a drone threat detection system for various environments and characteristics.	https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85056655170&origin=inward    https://www.spiedigitallibrary.org/conference-proceedings-of-spie/10797/107970I/Ladar-data-generation-fused-with-virtual-targets-and-visualization-for/10.1117/12.2500525.pdf	no

The Target Differential Game with Two Defenders	A cooperative aircraft differential game where an Attacker missile pursues an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) herein called the Target is addressed. The Target UAV cooperates with up to two Defender missiles which are launched in order to intercept the Attacker before the latter reaches the Target. This is a scenario with important military applications where each one of the agents is an autonomous air vehicle. Each agent plans and corrects its course of action in order to defeat an opposing force while simultaneously optimizing an operational relevant cost/payoff performance measure. The Target and the Defenders cooperate to form a team against the Attacker. The results in this paper build on the solution of a three agent differential game, where the three players are the Target, the Attacker, and one Defender; in this paper, the benefits of firing a second Defender are considered. Indeed, launching two interceptor missiles is a standard procedure by providing redundant backup. Building on the solution of the one-Defender problem, it is possible to address a seemingly intractable problem, where the Target needs to decide which Defender(s) to cooperate with, in addition to obtaining the optimal headings of every player in the game. Given the initial positions of the players, we solve the problem of determining if a second Defender improves the Target/Defender(s) payoff and provide the optimal strategies for each of the agents involved. Finally, we address the game of kind (for the case of one Defender) which provides the safety regions to determine which side will win based on the initial state. These safety regions provides the Target’s area of vulnerability, and using these results, we describe the reduction to the Target’s vulnerability area brought by an additional Defender.	https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85018755402&origin=inward    https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007/s10846-017-0563-0.pdf	no
B.SAR: blind SAR data focusing	Synthetic Aperture RADAR (SAR) is a radar imaging technique in which the relative motion of the sensor is used to synthesize a very long antenna and obtain high spatial resolution. The increasing interest of the scientific community to simplify SAR sensors and develop automatic system to quickly obtain a sufficiently good precision image is fostered by the will of developing low-cost/light-weight SAR systems to be carried by drones. Standard SAR raw data processing techniques assume uniform motion of the satellite (or aerial vehicle) and a fixed antenna beam pointing sideway orthogonally to the motion path, assumed rectilinear. In the same hypothesis, a novel blind data focusing technique is presented, able to obtain good quality images of the inspected area, in the presence of a strong point scatterer, without the use of ancillary data information. Despite SAR data processing is a well established imaging technology that has become fundamental in several fields and applications, in this paper a novel approach has been used to exploit coherent illumination, demonstrating the possibility of extracting a large part of the ancillary data information from the raw data itself, to be used in the focusing procedure. Preliminary results – still prone to enhancements – are presented for ERS raw data focusing.

Measurements of SWIR backgrounds using the swux unit of measure	The SWIR waveband between 0.8μm-1.8μm is getting increasingly exploited by imaging systems in a variety of different applications, including persistent imaging for security and surveillance of high-value assets, handheld tactical imagers, range-gated imaging systems and imaging LADAR for driverless vehicles. The vast majority of these applications utilize lattice-matched InGaAs detectors in their imaging sensors, and these sensors are rapidly falling in price, leading to their widening adoption. As these sensors are used in novel applications and locations, it is important that ambient SWIR backgrounds be understood and characterized for a variety of different field conditions, primarily for the purposes of system performance modeling of SNR and range metrics. SWIR irradiance backgrounds do not consistently track visible-light illumination at all. There is currently little of this type of information in the open literature, particularly measurements of SWIR backgrounds in urban areas, natural areas, or indoors. This paper presents field measurements done with an InGaAs detector calibrated in the swux unit of InGaAs-band-specific irradiance proposed by two of the authors in 2017. Simultaneous measurements of illuminance levels (in lux) at these sites are presented, as well as visible and InGaAs camera images of the scenery at some of these measurement sites. The swux and lux measurement hardware is described, along with the methods used to calibrate it. Finally, the swux levels during the partial and total phases of the total solar eclipse of 2017 are presented, along with curves fitted to the data from a theoretical model, based on obscuration of the sun by the moon. The apparent differences between photometric and swux measurements will be discussed.	https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85048139769&origin=inward    https://www.spiedigitallibrary.org/conference-proceedings-of-spie/10625/106250P/Measurements-of-SWIR-backgrounds-using-the-swux-unit-of-measure/10.1117/12.2305282.pdf	no
The VFO-Driven Motion Planning and Feedback Control in Polygonal Worlds for a Unicycle with Bounded Curvature of Motion	Integrated motion planning and control for the purposes of maneuvering mobile robots under state- and input constraints is a problem of vital practical importance in applications of mobile robots such as autonomous transportation. Those constraints arise naturally in practice due to specifics of robot mechanical construction and the presence of obstacles in motion environment. In contrast to approaches focusing on feedback control design under the assumption of given reference motion or motion planning with neglection of subsequent feedback motion execution, we adopt a controller-driven motion planning paradigm, which has recently gained attention of many researchers. It postulates design of motion planning algorithms dedicated to specific feedback control policies, which compute a sequence of feedback control subtasks instead of classically planned open-loop controls or parametric paths. In this spirit, we propose a motion planning algorithm driven by the VFO (Vector Field Orientation) control law for the waypoint-following task. Presented analysis of the VFO control law reveals its beneficial properties, which are subsequently utilized to solve a generally nonlinear and non-convex optimal motion planning problem by formulating it as a mixed-integer linear program (MILP). The solution proposed in this paper yields a waypoint sequence, which is designed for execution by application of the VFO control law to drive a robot to a prescribed final configuration under an input constraint imposed by bounded curvature of robot motion and state constraints resulting from a convex decomposition of task space. Satisfaction of these constraints is guaranteed analytically and exactly, i.e., without utilization of numerical approximations. Moreover, for a given discrete set of possible waypoint orientations, the proposed algorithm computes plans optimal w.r.t. given cost functional, which can be any convex linear combination of quantities such as robot path length, curvature of robot motion, distance to imposed state constraints, etc. Furthermore, the planning algorithm exploits the possibility of both forward or backward movement of the robot to allow maneuvering in demanding environments. Generated waypoint sequences are a compact representation of a motion plan, which can be immediately executed with the VFO controller without any additional post-processing. Validity of the proposed approach has been confirmed by simulation studies and experimental motion execution with a laboratory-scale mobile robot.	https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85018751619&origin=inward    https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007/s10846-017-0555-0.pdf	no
Counter drones: tensor decompostion-based data fusion and systems design aspects	Unmanned Aerial Systems UAS, i.e. drones, revolutionize the market for mobility based services and enable more efficient defence and security operations. Also this rapidly developing technology, however, proves to be Janus-faced. Despite their unquestionable benefits, UAS increasingly pose serious safety and security threats. Detection, tracking, and classification of small and highly agile drones, however, is one of the most challenging surveillance tasks. Only a properly designed suite of heterogeneous and mutually complementary sensor provides the required sensor data. On this basis, the key technology proves to advanced multiple sensor data fusion that provides situational awareness and the key information for assigning appropriate counter measures. We in particular focus on a novel approach and highly promising approach which has the potential of a paradigm shift in sensor data fusion: tensor decomposition based multiple sensor tracking filters. This new methodology for fusion engines is able to efficiently represent the full informational content of advanced sensors and sophisticated dynamic models for drone motion. Powerful multilinear decomposition methods for tensors are drastically reducing the computational efforts for producing high-quality tracks for dim and agile drones. Moreover, the deterministic performance characteristics of tensor decomposition based fusion have beneficial implications for systems design aspects. These advanced algorithms of multiple sensor data fusion play a key role in designing counter drone systems. In the context of C5ISR systems (Command, Control, Communications, Computer, Cyber, Intelligence, Surveillance and Reconnaissance), the technological challenges can be met, but require close cooperation between the military and police forces, research institutes and the relevant industries. In the protection of stationary equipment and mobile units in urban or open terrain, the integration of drone detection / tracking / classification in decision support systems is crucial.	https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85079278071&origin=inward    https://www.spiedigitallibrary.org/conference-proceedings-of-spie/10799/107990O/Counter-drones--tensor-decompostion-based-data-fusion-and-systems/10.1117/12.2325126.pdf	yes
An image processing pipeline for long range UAV detection	The number of affordable consumer unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) available on the market has been growing quickly in recent years. Uncontrolled use of such UAVs in the context of public events like sports events or demonstrations, as well as their use near sensitive areas, such as airports or correctional facilities pose a potential security threat. Automatic early detection of UAVs is thus an important task which can be addressed through multiple modalities, such as visual imagery, radar, audio signals, or UAV control signals. In this work we present an image processing pipeline which is capable of tracking very small point targets in an overview camera, adjusting a tilting unit with a mounted zoom camera (PTZ system) to locations of interest and classifying the spotted object in this more detailed camera view. The overview camera is a high-resolution camera with a wide field of view. Its main purpose is to monitor a wide area and to allow an early detection of candidates, whose motion or appearance warrant a closer investigation. In a subsequent process these candidates are prioritized and successively examined by adapting the orientation of the tilting unit and the zoom level of the attached camera lens, to be able to observe the target in detail and provide appropriate data for the classification stage. The image of the PTZ camera is then used to classify the object into either UAV class or distractor class. For this task we apply the popular SSD detector. Several parameters of the detector have been adapted for the task of UAV detection and classification. We demonstrate the performance of the full pipeline on imagery collected by the system. The data contains actual UAVs as well as distractors, such as birds.	https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85077340920&origin=inward    https://www.spiedigitallibrary.org/conference-proceedings-of-spie/10799/107990T/An-image-processing-pipeline-for-long-range-UAV-detection/10.1117/12.2325735.pdf	no
Responding to unmanned aerial swarm saturation attacks with autonomous counter-swarms	Autonomous unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) present an increasingly viable threat vector to the Defense com- munity. Existing response systems are vulnerable to saturation attacks of large swarms of low-cost autonomous vehicles. One method of reducing this threat is the use of an intelligent counter swarm with tactics, navigation and planning capabilities for engaging the adversarial swarm. Though previous studies exist that have produced libraries of basic fighter tactics employable by unmanned fixed-wing aircraft, we are aware of little prior work that explores close-in tactical engagements at a large scale (teams of at least size 10). We examine existing technologies that can be applied in fixed-wing swarm-versus-swarm engagement, including classic pursuit-evasion strategies and the application of Lanchester's laws for attrition calculations. Our recent studies center on lever- aging existing manned fighter combat doctrine, and on the benefits of collaboration. We consider experiments in close-air combat against adversaries capable of destroying aerial targets. The following work employs both a Monte Carlo analysis in a simulation environment to measure the effectiveness of several autonomous tactics, as well as an analysis of live flight experiments in swarm competitions with up to 10 vs. 10 scenarios.	https://www.spiedigitallibrary.org/conference-proceedings-of-spie/10635/106350Y/Responding-to-unmanned-aerial-swarm-saturation-attacks-with-autonomous-counter/10.1117/12.2305086.pdf    https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85050195031&origin=inward	maybe
Effective direction of arrival estimation of gunshot signals from an in-flight unmanned aerial vehicle	Spotting a shooter from a drone has been the subject of great interest lately due to its many applications in the fields of defense and security and law enforcement. Using a drone can be an effective way to detect potential threats in many real-life scenarios. Nevertheless, acoustic signals recorded from a drone usually exhibit a very low SNR, mainly due to the distance to the source and the proximity of the sensors to the propellers. This is a serious limiting factor and, therefore, the use of signal enhancement techniques is required. This work addresses the problem of determining the Direction-of-Arrival (DoA) of the muzzle blast, captured using a planar microphone array mounted on a commercial DJI PHANTOM 4 drone in flight. This new shooter localization method that relies solely on detecting and estimating the DoA of the muzzle blast. However, the typical low SNR in this scenario requires the use of preprocessing techniques, such as signal clipping and median filtering, to enhance the signal of interest (muzzle blast). In addition, we employ a recently introduced improved data selection DoA estimation method suitable for gunshot signals recorded from a low to medium altitude mobile aerial platform. Positive results achieved indicate that this approach is effective and of practical interest.	https://www.spiedigitallibrary.org/conference-proceedings-of-spie/10648/106480H/Effective-direction-of-arrival-estimation-of-gunshot-signals-from-an/10.1117/12.2307657.pdf    https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85048408795&origin=inward	no
Lidar-based detection and tracking of small UAVs	The number of reported incidents caused by small UAVs, intentional as well as accidental, is rising. To avoid such incidents in future, it is essential to be able to detect UAVs. LiDAR sensors (e.g., laser scanners) are well known to be adequate sensors for object detection and tracking.<p>  </p> In this paper, we expand our existing LiDAR-based approach for the tracking and detection of (low) flying small objects like commercial mini/micro UAVs. We show that UAVs can be detected by the proposed methods, as long as the movements of the UAVs correspond to the LiDAR sensor’s capabilities in scanning performance, range and resolution. The trajectory of the tracked object can further be analyzed to support the classification, meaning that UAVs and non- UAV objects can be distinguished by an identification of typical movement patterns. A stable tracking of the UAV is achieved by a precise prediction of its movement. In addition to this precise prediction of the target’s position, the object detection, tracking and classification have to be achieved in real-time. <p>  </p>For the algorithm development and a performance analysis, we analyzed LiDAR data that we acquired during a field trial. Several different mini/micro UAVs were observed by a system of four 360° LiDAR sensors mounted to a car. Using this specific sensor system, the results show that UAVs can be detected and tracked by the proposed methods, allowing a protection of the car against UAV threats within a radius of up to 35 m.	https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85075613472&origin=inward    https://www.spiedigitallibrary.org/conference-proceedings-of-spie/10799/107990S/Lidar-based-detection-and-tracking-of-small-UAVs/10.1117/12.2325702.pdf	no
Coastal 3D mapping using very high resolution satellite images and UAV imagery: new insights from the SAVEMEDCOASTS project	Global climate changes are a main factor of risk for infrastructures and people living along the coasts around the world. In this context, sea level rise, coastal retreat and storm surges pose serious threats to coastal zones. In order to assess the expected coastal changes for the next decades, a detailed knowledge of the site’s topography (coastline position, DTM, bathymetry) is needed. This paper focuses on the use of very high resolution satellite data and UAV imagery for the generation of accurate very-high and ultra-high mapping of coastal areas. In addition, the use of very high resolution multi-spectral satellite data is investigated for the generation of coastal bathymetry maps. The paper presents a study for the island of Lipari and the coasts of Cinque Terre (Italy) and the island of Lefkas (Greece). For Lefkas, two areas of the island were mapped (the city of Lefkas and its adjoining lagoon in the north side of the island, and the Bay of Vasiliki at the south part of the island) using World View 1, and Wolrd View 3 satellite images, and UAV imagery. The satellite processing provided results that demonstrated an accuracy of approximately 0.25 m plannimetrically and 0.70 m vertically. The processing of the UAV imagery resulted in the generation of DTMs and orthophotos with an accuracy of approximately 0.03-0.04 meters. In addition, for the Vasiliki bay in the south of the island the World View 3 imagery was used for the estimation of a bathymetry map of the bay. The achieved results yielded an accuracy of 0.4 m. For the sites of Lipari and Cinque Terre (both in Italy), UAV surveys allowed to extract a DTM at about 2 cm of pixel resolution. The integration of topographic data with high resolution multibeam bathymetry and expected sea level rise from IPCC AR5 2.6 and 8.5 climatic scenarios, will be used to map sea level rise scenarios for 2050 and 2100, taking into account the Vertical Land Motion (VLM) as estimated from CGPS data. The above-mentioned study was realized during the implementation of the SAVEMEDCOASTS project (Sea level rise scenarios along the Mediterranean coasts, funded by the European Commission ECHO A.5, GA ECHO/SUB/2016/742473/PREV16, www.savemedcoasts.eu).	https://www.spiedigitallibrary.org/conference-proceedings-of-spie/10773/107730V/Coastal-3D-mapping-using-very-high-resolution-satellite-images-and/10.1117/12.2325540.pdf    https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85052707759&origin=inward	no
The UAV safety control based on cognition-guidance	With the development of aviation industry around the world, unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) are broadly applied in modern warfare and civilian fields, which induces a big boom in the number of aircrafts, thus posing a great threat for flight security with the increasing aircraft density in the sky in the near future. Although current researches and methods can deal with the UAV safety problems well at some extent, the effectiveness of them is greatly reduced when the UAV is in a highly antagonism and harsh environment. In this work, the autonomous safety control method for the UAV system is researched and explored from the need of improving the operational security of UAV system. UAV safety control method based on cognition-guidance refers to that the UAV can rely on perceptual and cognitive computing functions of the UAV system during the flight guidance to perceive and identify the forthcoming or ongoing security risks and to generate a correct evasion strategy. Cognition-guidance is a specific application of the cognitive computing. The safety connotation of the UAV and the research status of safety control are firstly analyzed, then, the relationship between the guidance and human cognition is discussed, and the UAV safety control method based on cognition-guidance is proposed. Besides, the UAV anti-collision control strategy is designed, and taking the two UAVs anti-collision control mission as an example, the simulation research for the UAV safety control method based on cognition-guidance is studied. And the simulation results have proved that the method is effective.	https://www.spiedigitallibrary.org/conference-proceedings-of-spie/10835/108351M/The-UAV-safety-control-based-on-cognition-guidance/10.1117/12.2505430.pdf    https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85053467384&origin=inward	maybe

Integrating ground surveillance with aerial surveillance for enhanced amateur drone detection	Unmanned Aerial Systems (UASs) are becoming increasingly popular for amateur use, but their arbitrary deployment poses severe public safety threats to critical infrastructures, such as airports. Typically an Amateur Unmanned Aerial System (AUAS) communicates with a ground control station (GCS) through a telemetry radio, which keeps transmitting data in poor connection conditions. The accuracy of AUASs detection is of great significance. In this paper, we propose a novel surveillance framework which leverages Surveillance Unmanned Aerial Systems (SUASs) to detect AUASs. The approximate position of an AUAS is first estimated by Ground Surveillance Nodes (GSNs) with radio receivers, and SUASs are then activated to determine its precise position. Different from previous research, this framework not only leverages both ground and aerial surveillance capabilities, but also integrates both radio and image processing techniques, thus achieving enhanced AUAS detection capability. This platform has the potential to be integrated with other advanced technologies, providing the recognition of radio signals and imagery for a holistic solution of effective AUAS detection.	https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85049210221&origin=inward    https://www.spiedigitallibrary.org/conference-proceedings-of-spie/10652/106520E/Integrating-ground-surveillance-with-aerial-surveillance-for-enhanced-amateur-drone/10.1117/12.2304531.pdf	no
Decision-Making Framework for Automated Driving in Highway Environments	This paper presents a decision-making framework for automated driving in highway environments. The framework is capable of reliably, robustly assessing a given highway situation (with respect to the possibility of collision) and of automatically determining an appropriate maneuver for the situation. It consists of two main components: situation assessment and strategy decision. The situation assessment component utilizes multiple complementary “threat measures” and Bayesian networks in its calculations of “threat levels” at the car and lane level to evaluate the possibility of collisions for a given highway traffic situation. The strategy decision component, designed to generate goal-directed and collision-free behaviors, automatically determines an appropriate maneuver in a given highway situation via a hierarchical state machine-such a machine both reduces the complexity of and extends a strategy model. The types of maneuver determined by the component include both simple maneuvers, such as slowing down to avoid collision with a vehicle in front, and complex maneuvers, such as lane changes and overtaking. The presented decision-making framework is tested and evaluated-both on a closed high-speed test track in simulated traffic with various driving scenarios and on public highways in real traffic through in-vehicle testing-to verify that it can provide sufficiently reliable performance for automated driving in highway environments in terms of safety, reliability, and robustness.	https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7907201	no

Using Extreme Value Theory for Vehicle Level Safety Validation and Implications for Autonomous Vehicles	Much effort is put right now into how to make autonomous vehicles as capable as possible in order to be able to replace humans as drivers. Less focus is put into how to ensure that this transition happens in a safe way that we can put trust in. The verification of the extreme dependability requirements connected to safety is expected to be one of the largest challenges to overcome in the commercialization of autonomous vehicles. Using traditional statistical methods to validate complete vehicle safety would require the vehicle to cover extreme distances to show that collisions occur rare enough. However, recent research has shown the possibility of using near-collisions in order to estimate the frequency of actual collisions using Extreme Value Theory. To use this method, there is a need for a measure related to the closeness of a collision. This paper shows that the choice of this threat measure has a significant impact on the inferences drawn from the data. With the right measure, this method can be used to validate the safety of a vehicle. This, while keeping the validity high and the data required lower than the state of the art statistical methods.	https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8094027	0

Cyber Threats Facing Autonomous and Connected Vehicles: Future Challenges	Vehicles are currently being developed and sold with increasing levels of connectivity and automation. As with all networked computing devices, increased connectivity often results in a heightened risk of a cyber security attack. Furthermore, increased automation exacerbates any risk by increasing the opportunities for the adversary to implement a successful attack. In this paper, a large volume of publicly accessible literature is reviewed and compartmentalized based on the vulnerabilities identified and mitigation techniques developed. This review highlighted that the majority of studies are reactive and vulnerabilities are often discovered by friendly adversaries (white-hat hackers). Many gaps in the knowledge base were identified. Priority should be given to address these knowledge gaps to minimize future cyber security risks in the connected and autonomous vehicle sector.	https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7872388	0

Control of a City Road Network: Distributed Exact Verification of Traffic Safety	A least-restrictive supervisor for vehicle collision avoidance is a control algorithm that can detect an unsafe maneuver by a set of human-driven or autonomous vehicles, intervening with a corrective action only when needed to avoid a collision. It can help prevent collisions, and facilitate coexistence of autonomous and human-driven vehicles. Such an algorithm is based on a formal verification problem which, unfortunately, is known to be NP-hard in many cases of interest, for instance at traffic intersections. Here, we propose a strategy to dynamically decompose the formal verification problem of a large road network, exploiting vehicle dynamics and the constraints induced by road topology to separate nonconflicting vehicles. We split the global problem into smaller and treatable subproblems, while still allowing to compute an exact solution. We illustrate our results on three different scenarios.	https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7867800	0
Memory Unscented Particle Filter for 6-DOF Tactile Localization	This paper addresses 6-DOF (degree-of-freedom) tactile localization, i.e., the pose estimation of tridimensional objects using tactile measurements. This estimation problem is fundamental for the operation of autonomous robots that are often required to manipulate and grasp objects whose pose is a priori unknown. The nature of tactile measurements, the strict time requirements for real-time operation, and the multimodality of the involved probability distributions pose remarkable challenges and call for advanced nonlinear filtering techniques. Following a Bayesian approach, this paper proposes a novel and effective algorithm, named memory unscented particle filter (MUPF), which solves 6-DOF localization recursively in real time by only exploiting contact point measurements. The MUPF combines a modified particle filter that incorporates a sliding memory of past measurements to better handle multimodal distributions, along with the unscented Kalman filter that moves the particles toward regions of the search space that are more likely with the measurements. The performance of the proposed MUPF algorithm has been assessed both in simulation and on a real robotic system equipped with tactile sensors (i.e., the iCub humanoid robot). The experiments show that the algorithm provides accurate and reliable localization even with a low number of particles and, hence, is compatible with real-time requirements.	https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7948794	0
An Inertial-Aided Homography-Based Visual Servo Control Approach for (Almost) Fully Actuated Autonomous Underwater Vehicles	A nonlinear inertial-aided image-based visual servo control approach for the stabilization of (almost) fully actuated autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs) is proposed. It makes use of the homography matrix between two images of a planar scene as feedback information while the system dynamics are exploited in a cascade manner in a control design: An outer-loop control defines a reference setpoint based on the homography matrix and an inner-loop control ensures the stabilization of the setpoint by assigning the thrust and torque controls. Unlike conventional solutions that only consider the system kinematics, the proposed control scheme is novel in considering the full system dynamics (incorporating all degrees of freedom, nonlinearities, and couplings, as well as interactions with the surrounding fluid) and in not requiring information of the relative depth and normal vector of the observed scene. Augmented with integral corrections, the proposed controller is robust with respect to model uncertainties and disturbances. The almost global asymptotic stability of the closed-loop system is demonstrated, which is the largest domain of attraction one can achieve by means of continuous feedback control. Simulation results illustrating these properties on a realistic AUV model subjected to a sea current are presented and finally experimental results on a real AUV are reported.	https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7938759	0
Combined Speed and Steering Control in High-Speed Autonomous Ground Vehicles for Obstacle Avoidance Using Model Predictive Control	This paper presents a model predictive control-based obstacle avoidance algorithm for autonomous ground vehicles at high speed in unstructured environments. The novelty of the algorithm is its capability to control the vehicle to avoid obstacles at high speed taking into account dynamical safety constraints through a simultaneous optimization of reference speed and steering angle without a priori knowledge about the environment and without a reference trajectory to follow. Previous work in this specific context optimized only the steering command. In this paper, obstacles are detected using a planar light detection and ranging sensor. A multi-phase optimal control problem is then formulated to simultaneously optimize the reference speed and steering angle within the detection range. Vehicle acceleration capability as a function of speed, as well as stability and handling concerns such as preventing wheel lift-off, are included as constraints in the optimization problem, whereas the cost function is formulated to navigate the vehicle as quickly as possible with smooth control commands. Simulation results show that the proposed algorithm is capable of safely exploiting the dynamic limits of the vehicle while navigating the vehicle through sensed obstacles of different sizes and numbers. It is also shown that the proposed variable speed formulation can significantly improve performance by allowing navigation of obstacle fields that would otherwise not be cleared with steering control alone.	https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7932889	0

Energy Based 3D Autopilot for VTOL UAV Under Guidance & Navigation Constraints	Motion control design plays a crucial role in autonomous vehicles. Mainly, these systems operate in conditions of under-actuation, which make the control a serious task especially in presence of practical constraints. The main objective within this paper is to ensure the tracking of 3D reference trajectory overcoming some of the issues related to the control of multi-rotor vehicles (such as underactuation, robustness, limited power, accuracy, overshoot, etc.). Therefore, a control scheme for Vertical Take Off and Landing (VTOL) multi-rotor Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) is designed, applying the Interconnection and Damping Assignment-Passivity Based Control (IDA-PBC) technique. As reference model based technique, the control specifications are readily met by fixing a desired dynamic model, which is a major advantage of the technique. Moreover, a port −controlled Hamiltonian representation is exploited in order to point out the physical properties of the system such as its internal energy. This latter is exploited, as a fitness function for an optimization algorithm, in order to decrease the consumed energy especially at the take-off step and allows the tuning of the controller parameters. The numerical simulations have shown satisfactory results that support the claims using nominal system model or disturbed model. The designed controller has been implemented on a real vehicle for which one demonstrates, in an indoor area manipulation, the effectiveness of the proposed control strategy.	https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=84996671082&origin=inward    https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007/s10846-016-0441-1.pdf	0
Exploiting antenna motion for faster initialization of centimeter-accurate gnss positioning with low-cost antennas	This paper investigates the effectiveness of multipath-decorrelating antenna motion in reducing the initialization time of global navigation satellite system (GNSS) receivers employing low-cost single-frequency antennas for carrier-phase differential GNSS (CDGNSS) positioning. Fast initialization times with low-cost antennas will encourage the expansion of CDGNSS into the mass market, bringing the benefits of globally referenced centimeter-accurate positioning to many consumer applications, such as augmented reality and autonomous vehicles, that have so far been hampered by the several-meter-level errors of traditional GNSS positioning. Poor multipath suppression common to low-cost antennas results in large and strongly time-correlated phase errors when a receiver is static. Such errors can result in the CDGNSS initialization time, the so-called time to ambiguity resolution (TAR), extending to hundreds of seconds - many times longer than for higher cost survey-grade antennas, which have substantially better multipath suppression. This paper demonstrates that TAR can be significantly reduced through antenna motion, particularly gentle wavelength-scale random antenna motion. Such motion acts to decrease the correlation time of the multipath-induced phase errors. A priori knowledge of the motion profile is shown to further reduce TAR, with the reduction shown to be more pronounced as the initialization scenario is more challenging.

Reactive Obstacle Avoidance for Highly Maneuverable Vehicles Based on a Two-Stage Optical Flow Clustering	This paper proposes a reactive obstacle avoidance approach based solely on image data from a monocular camera stream. By clustering and analyzing the optical flow, this approach is able to identify potential collisions with dynamic obstacles. Epipolar geometry is exploited to derive velocity commands that ensure a collision-free path for a highly maneuverable autonomous vehicle via a real-time optimizer. First, the underlying image processing and optimization principles are explained in detail, before simulation results show the general feasibility of the approach. Finally, real-world tests with the ROboMObil, the German Aerospace Center's robotic electric vehicle, are provided to demonstrate its applicability.	https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7782362	0
Uncalibrated Visual Servo for Unmanned Aerial Manipulation	This paper addresses the problem of autonomous servoing an unmanned redundant aerial manipulator using computer vision. The overactuation of the system is exploited by means of a hierarchical control law, which allows to prioritize several tasks during flight. We propose a safety-related primary task to avoid possible collisions. As a secondary task, we present an uncalibrated image-based visual servo strategy to drive the arm end-effector to a desired position and orientation by using a camera attached to it. In contrast to the previous visual servo approaches, a known value of camera focal length is not strictly required. To further improve flight behavior, we hierarchically add one task to reduce dynamic effects by vertically aligning the arm center of gravity to the multirotor gravitational vector, and another one that keeps the arm close to a desired configuration of high manipulability and avoiding arm joint limits. The performance of the hierarchical control law, with and without activation of each of the tasks, is shown in simulations and in real experiments confirming the viability of such prioritized control scheme for aerial manipulation.

Estimation of Synchromesh Frictional Torque and Output Torque in a Clutchless Automated Manual Transmission of a Parallel Hybrid Electric Vehicle	This paper studies the estimation of the synchromesh frictional torque and the output torque of the integrated system of an electric motor and a clutchless automated manual transmission (AMT) as part of a two-shaft parallel hybrid electric vehicle powertrain. The case study powertrain is discussed, and the dynamical model of the powertrain from the electric motor to the AMT output shaft, where it is linked to the torque coupler, is developed constituting the basis for the observer design. Given the fact that the aforementioned torques are unknown inputs to the system, they are modeled as state variables of a fictitious unforced linear time-invariant system in order to be aggregated into the systems dynamics. For the augmented system of the actual and fictitious states, a deterministic Luenberger observer and a stochastic Kalman-Bucy filter (KBF) are designed to estimate the synchromesh frictional torque and the output torque of the AMT. The estimation is based on measuring angular velocities of the electric motor and the AMT output shaft, together with the imparted electromagnetic torque of the traction motor on the system. A set of experiments with distinct scenarios is performed to compare the performance of the designed observers and to quantify by how much the KBF can improve the root-mean-square error (RMSE) of the estimation by mitigating the effect of the process and measurement noises. Ultimately, after validation of the designed observers, the estimated value of the synchromesh frictional torque is exploited in a closed-loop feedback configuration in order to track desired trajectories such as step, ramp, and sinusoidal torque commands.	https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7604128	0
A robust predictor–corrector entry guidance	With the development of aerospace industry, the guidance system of an entry vehicle becomes more robust, reliable and autonomous. Based on fuzzy logic, a predictorâcorrector guidance law is proposed in this paper, where the trajectory prediction is realized by numerical integration. The correction system consists of two fuzzy controllers, which correct longitudinal motion and lateral motion synergistically. A drag acceleration profile is designed through interpolating between upper drag boundary and lower drag boundary, which is corrected continually to eliminate the range error. Attack angle, a secondary control variable in the paper, is used to eliminate the altitude error. In addition, the lateral error is removed by regulating the reversal time of bank angle. Compared with the traditional guidance laws, the method in this paper not only can correct synergistically the longitudinal motion and lateral motion of the vehicle, but also can easily cope with the flight constraints using interpolated drag acceleration profile. Moreover, in a correction cycle, the method designed in this paper only needs a single trajectory prediction, which reduces the on-board computation. The guidance law demonstrates a high precision and robustness in the simulation scenario.

Analytical entry guidance based on pseudo-aerodynamic profiles	An autonomous entry guidance is developed for a hypersonic glide vehicle with high Lift-to-Drag ratio (L/D) based on 3-D analytical glide formulas. To compensate the effects of the Earth's rotation, the pseudo-aerodynamic forces are introduced as the fusions of the aerodynamic forces and inertial forces due to the Earth's rotation. To avoid drastic changes in Angle of Attack (AOA) and bank angle, we carefully forecast the change trends of the inertial forces and then design the pseudo-aerodynamic profiles as inversely proportional functions. Here a complex but useful identity is found and proved theoretically, which helps to simplify the pseudo-aerodynamic profiles without losing accuracy significantly. Subsequently, new 3-D analytical glide formulas are derived for these inversely-proportional profiles and then used to determine the profile parameters and bank reversals. Due to the careful design, the guidance is capable of steering the high-L/D vehicle to any place on the Earth accurately while achieving almost constant commands during the steady glide phase, a major phase of flight. The superior performance of the guidance is verified by the Monte Carlo simulations with challenging disturbances including initial state dispersions, aerodynamic uncertainties, and atmospheric perturbations.

Wildfire Fighting by Unmanned Aerial System Exploiting Its Time-Varying Mass	This letter presents an approach for accurately dropping a relatively large amount of fire retardant, water or some other extinguishing agent onto a wildfire from an autonomous unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV), in close proximity to the epicenter of the fire. The proposed approach involves a risky maneuver outside of the safe flight envelope of the UAV. This maneuver exploits the expected weight reduction resulting from the release of the payload, enabling the UAV to recover without impacting the terrain. The UAV is tilted to high pitch angles, at which the thrust may be pointed almost horizontally. The vehicle can therefore achieve higher horizontal speeds than would be allowed by conventional motion planners. This high speed allows the UAV to significantly reduce the time spent close to the fire. As a result, the overall high heat exposure is reduced, and the payload can be dropped closer to the target, minimizing its dispersion. A constrained optimal control problem (OCP) is solved taking into account environmental parameters such as wind and terrain gradients, as well as various payload releasing mechanisms. The proposed approach was verified in simulations and in real experiments. Emphasis was put on the real time recalculation of the solution, which will enable future adaptation into a model predictive controller (MPC) scheme.	https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8989795	0
Integrated Positioning for Connected Vehicles	In the era of autonomous cars, accurate vehicular positioning becomes very essential. The global navigation satellite systems (GNSS) suffer from signal blockage and severe multipath in urban canyons, which degrades the positioning accuracy and availability. Therefore, vehicles solely relying on positioning from GNSS receivers have limited performance. In this research, we present a novel unified cooperative positioning solution which enhances positioning accuracy and availability in urban canyons. The proposed system exploits the fact that vehicles have different positioning resources and is based on angle approximation, which artificially generates the hindered pseudorange by sharing angle information between vehicles using dedicated short-range communication. In addition, we propose a system that employs the proposed cooperative technique to assist the loose integration between the inertial navigation system (INS) and the GPS system (using extended Kalman filter) during partial GPS outages. Using raw data from inertial sensors and GPS receivers in the real road trajectories, we implement the cooperative INS/GPS loose integration and show that our cooperative integrated system outperforms the non-cooperative integrated system. The performance metrics used are the 2-D positioning root-mean-square error, the maximum 2-D positioning error, and the positioning accuracy gain (PAG). Specifically, the PAG gain is around 88%, 80%, and 60% when the number of blocked satellites is one, two, and three, respectively.	https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8638823	0
Human-in-the-Loop Robotic Manipulation Planning for Collaborative Assembly	This article develops a robotic manipulation planner for human-robot collaborative assembly. Unlike previous methods that study an independent and fully artificial intelligent (AI)-equipped autonomous system, this article explores the subtask distribution between a robot and a human and studies a human-in-the-loop robotic system for collaborative assembly. The system distributes the subtasks of an assembly to robots and humans by exploiting their advantages and avoiding their disadvantages. The robot in the system will work on pick-and-place tasks and provide workpieces to humans. The human collaborator will work on fine operations, such as aligning, fixing, and screwing. A constraint-based incremental manipulation planning method is proposed to generate the motion for the robots. The performance of the proposed system is demonstrated by asking a human and the dual-arm robot to collaboratively assemble a cabinet. The results show that the proposed system and planner are effective and efficient and can assist humans in finishing the assembly task comfortably.	https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9044335	0
Vid2Param: Modeling of Dynamics Parameters From Video	Sensors are routinely mounted on robots to acquire various forms of measurements in spatio-temporal fields. Locating features within these fields and reconstruction (mapping) of the dense fields can be challenging in resource-constrained situations, such as when trying to locate the source of a gas leak from a small number of measurements. In such cases, a model of the underlying complex dynamics can be exploited to discover informative paths within the field. We use a fluid simulator as a model, to guide inference for the location of a gas leak. We perform localization via minimization of the discrepancy between observed measurements and gas concentrations predicted by the simulator. Our method is able to account for dynamically varying parameters of wind flow (e.g., direction and strength), and its effects on the observed distribution of gas. We develop algorithms for off-line inference as well as for on-line path discovery via active sensing. We demonstrate the efficiency, accuracy and versatility of our algorithm using experiments with a physical robot conducted in outdoor environments. We deploy an unmanned air vehicle (UAV) mounted with a CO2 sensor to automatically seek out a gas cylinder emitting CO2 via a nozzle. We evaluate the accuracy of our algorithm by measuring the error in the inferred location of the nozzle, based on which we show that our proposed approach is competitive with respect to state of the art baselines.	https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8931564	0
Fuzzy Static Output Feedback Control for Path Following of Autonomous Vehicles With Transient Performance Improvements	This paper provides a new solution for path following control of autonomous ground vehicles. H2 control problem is considered to attenuate the effect of the road curvature disturbance. To this end, we formulate a standard model from the road-vehicle dynamics, the a priori knowledge on the road curvature, and the path following specifications. This standard model is then represented in a Takagi-Sugeno fuzzy form to deal with the time-varying nature of the vehicle speed. Based on a static output feedback scheme, the proposed method allows avoiding expensive vehicle sensors while keeping the simplest control structure for real-time implementation. The concept of V-stability is exploited using Lyapunov stability arguments to improve the transient behaviors of the closed-loop vehicle system. In particular, the physical upper and lower bounds of the vehicle acceleration are explicitly considered in the design procedure via a parameter-dependent Lyapunov function to reduce drastically the design conservatism. The proposed H2 design conditions are expressed in terms of linear matrix inequalities (LMIs) with a single line search parameter. The effectiveness of the new path following control method is clearly demonstrated with both theoretical illustrations and hardware experiments under realworld driving situations.	https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8759985	0
Enhancing Misbehavior Detection in 5G Vehicle-to-Vehicle Communications	Next-generation advanced driver-assistance systems (ADAS) and cooperative adaptive cruise control (CACC) for advanced/autonomous driving are expected to increasingly use wireless connectivity such as V2V and V2I to improve the coverage, particularly in the locations where a vehicle's camera or radar is ineffective. However, using shared sensing data raises grave concerns about the truthfulness of information reported by unreliable stakeholders. For example, a transmitting vehicle may deliberately disseminate false locations to the surrounding receivers. Trusting the data, the automatic control systems in such connected receivers can be trapped to change to a wrong lane or accelerate unexpectedly, and then potentially lead to a crash. This work introduces a novel approach to support a host vehicle in verifying the motion behavior of a target vehicle and then the truthfulness of sharing data in cooperative vehicular communications. Initially, at the host vehicle, the detection system recreates the motion behavior of the target vehicle by extracting the positioning information from the V2V received messages. Furthermore, the next states of that vehicle are predicted based on the unscented Kalman filter. Unlike prior studies, the checkpoints of the predicted trajectory in the update stage are periodically corrected with a new reliable measurement source, namely 5 G V2V multi-array beamforming localization. If there is any inconsistency between the estimated position and the corresponding reported one from V2V, the target vehicle will be classified as an abnormal one. The simulation results demonstrate that our method can achieve accuracy over 0.97 in detecting abnormal reports, including those from collusion and Sybil attacks.	https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9007476	0
Semiautomatic Labeling for Deep Learning in Robotics	In this article, we propose an augmented reality semiautomatic labeling (ARS), a semiautomatic method which leverages on moving a 2-D camera by means of a robot, proving precise camera tracking, and an augmented reality pen (ARP) to define initial object bounding box, to create large labeled data sets with minimal human intervention. By removing the burden of generating annotated data from humans, we make the deep learning technique applied to computer vision, which typically requires very large data sets, truly automated and reliable. With the ARS pipeline, we created two novel data sets effortlessly, one on electromechanical components (industrial scenario) and other on fruits (daily-living scenario) and trained two state-of-the-art object detectors robustly, based on convolutional neural networks, such as you only look once (YOLO) and single shot detector (SSD). With respect to conventional manual annotation of 1000 frames that takes us slightly more than 10 h, the proposed approach based on ARS allows to annotate 9 sequences of about 35 000 frames in less than 1 h, with a gain factor of about 450. Moreover, both the precision and recall of object detection is increased by about 15% with respect to manual labeling. All our software is available as a robot operating system (ROS) package in a public repository alongside with the novel annotated data sets. Note to Practitioners-This article was motivated by the lack of a simple and effective solution for the generation of data sets usable to train a data-driven model, such as a modern deep neural network, so as to make them accessible in an industrial environment. Specifically, a deep learning robot guidance vision system would require such a large amount of manually labeled images that it would be too expensive and impractical for a real use case, where system reconfigurability is a fundamental requirement. With our system, on the other hand, especially in the field of industrial robotics, the cost of image labeling can be reduced, for the first time, to nearly zero, thus paving the way for self-reconfiguring systems with very high performance (as demonstrated by our experimental results). One of the limitations of this approach is the need to use a manual method for the detection of objects of interest in the preliminary stages of the pipeline (ARP or graphical interface). A feasible extension, related to the field of collaborative robotics, could be used to exploit the robot itself, manually moved by the user, even for this preliminary stage, so as to eliminate any source of inaccuracy.	https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8844069	0
Cabin and Battery Thermal Management of Connected and Automated HEVs for Improved Energy Efficiency Using Hierarchical Model Predictive Control	Incorporating traffic information in power management optimization process for electrified and connected vehicles offers opportunities for improving fuel economy. Integrating the management of thermal load (such as those used for heating, ventilation, & air conditioning (HVAC) of the passenger compartment, and for the battery cooling) with the power management process can provide even greater benefits for connected and automated vehicles (CAVs). However, given the relatively slow dynamics associated with the thermal subsystems, the lack of reliable power and thermal loads prediction over an extended prediction horizon is the main challenge for efficient thermal management using model predictive control (MPC). This paper presents a hierarchical two-layer MPC scheme which exploits vehicle speed and traffic preview predictions over short and long prediction horizons to schedule optimal thermal trajectories for the cabin and battery cooling in hybrid electric vehicles (HEVs) via a novel intelligent online constraint handling (IOCH) approach. These trajectories are next incorporated into the vehicle-level controller to determine the proper power split between electric motor and internal combustion engine (ICE). We present the development and experimental validation of control-oriented models used for prediction of the vehicle thermal dynamics and loads over a long planning horizon. Compared to a more traditional single-layer MPC approach, the proposed two-layer MPC shows that depending on the driving cycle and traffic conditions, 2.2% to 5.3% reductions in HEV fuel consumption can be achieved for urban driving and congested city driving cycles, respectively, in CAV operation scenario. This fuel economy improvement is a direct result of taking proactive actions through real-time prediction and optimization to avoid conservative and inefficient thermal responses, while enforcing cabin and battery operating constraints.	https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8754762	0
An Integrated Threat Assessment Algorithm for Decision-Making of Autonomous Driving Vehicles	In order to decide a safe and reliable trajectory for autonomous driving vehicles, the threat of surrounding vehicles need to be assessed quantitatively and consider the potential risk. This paper proposes a novel integrated threat assessment algorithm for the decision-making system. First, the motion of the surrounding vehicle is predicted probabilistic based on the interact multiple model (IMM) to consider the potential threat. Then, we build an integrated threat assessment function to assess the threat in each state quantitatively and objectively, which synthesizes the existing time-to-collision (TTC), time-headway (TH), and the original proposed time-to-front (TTF). Based on this, the decision-making system is established according to the Markov decision process (MDP) and the feedback value of each decision sequence is calculated by the integrated threat assessment function, thus the safest trajectory for the current moment can be determined by optimal search. Finally, the decision-making system is verified in the overtaking and cut-in scenario by Carsim and Simulink co-simulation. The results show that the proposed threat assessment algorithm for the decision-making system can help autonomous vehicles decide a safe trajectory in real-time and maintain good maneuverability.	https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8753708	0
Opportunistic UAV Navigation With Carrier Phase Measurements From Asynchronous Cellular Signals	This article presents a framework for opportunistic unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) navigation by exploiting carrier phase measurements from ambient cellular signals of opportunity. In the proposed framework, the cellular base transceiver stations (BTSs) are not assumed to be synchronous. A complete framework that employs an extended Kalman filter (EKF) is presented, including filter initialization and process and measurement noise covariance selection. The EKF estimates the position and velocity of the UAV, as well as the differences between the UAV-mounted receiver and each of the BTSs' clock bias and clock drift. The observability of the estimation framework is analyzed, and the boundedness of the EKF's errors is studied. It is shown that the system is observable given a class of vehicle and receiver clock dynamics. A lower bound for the EKF estimation error covariance is derived, and it is shown that the covariance remains bounded. Monte Carlo simulations are conducted to study the effect of the number of BTSs, the initial UAV speed, and the receiver's oscillator quality, on the estimation performance. Two sets of experimental results are presented demonstrating UAVs navigating exclusively with cellular carrier phase measurements via the developed framework, achieving a total position root-mean-squared error of 2.94 and 5.99 m for UAV trajectories of 2.6 and 2.9 km, respectively.	https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8883288	0
Drones in Distress: A Game-Theoretic Countermeasure for Protecting UAVs Against GPS Spoofing	One prominent security threat that targets unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) is the capture via global positioning system (GPS) spoofing in which an attacker manipulates a UAV's GPS signals in order to capture it. Given the anticipated widespread deployment of UAVs for various purposes, it is imperative to develop new security solutions against such attacks. In this article, a mathematical framework is introduced for analyzing and mitigating the effects of GPS spoofing attacks on UAVs. In particular, system dynamics are used to model the optimal routes that the UAVs will adopt to reach their destinations. The GPS spoofer's effect on each UAV's route is also captured by the model. To this end, the spoofer's optimal imposed locations on the UAVs, are analytically derived; allowing the UAVs to predict their traveling routes under attack. Then, a countermeasure mechanism is developed to mitigate the effect of the GPS spoofing attack. The countermeasure is built on the premise of cooperative localization, in which a UAV can determine its location using nearby UAVs instead of the possibly compromised GPS locations. To better utilize the proposed defense mechanism, a dynamic Stackelberg game is formulated to model the interactions between a GPS spoofer and a drone operator. In particular, the drone operator acts as the leader that determines its optimal strategy in light of the spoofer's expected response strategy. The equilibrium strategies of the game are then analytically characterized and studied through a novel proposed algorithm. The simulation results show that, when combined with the Stackelberg strategies, the proposed defense mechanism will outperform baseline strategy selection techniques in terms of reducing the possibility of UAV capture.	https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8946587	0
Attack Analysis and Resilient Control Design for Discrete-Time Distributed Multi-Agent Systems	This work analyzes the adverse effects of cyberphysical attacks on discrete-time distributed multi-agent systems, and proposes a mitigation approach for attacks on sensors and actuators. First, we show how an attack on a single node snowballs into a network-wide attack and even destabilizes the entire system. Next, to overcome the adversarial effects of attacks on sensors and actuators, a distributed adaptive attack compensator is designed by estimating the normal expected behavior of agents. The adaptive attack compensator is augmented with the controller and it is shown that the proposed controller achieves secure consensus in the presence of the attacks on sensors and actuators. No restrictive assumption on the number of agents under adversarial input is assumed. Moreover, it recovers compromised agents under actuator attacks and avoids propagation of attacks on sensors without discarding information from the compromised agents. Finally, numerical simulations validate the effectiveness of the presented theoretical contributions on a network of Sentry autonomous underwater vehicles.	https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8932605	0
Resilient Output Containment of Heterogeneous Cooperative and Adversarial Multigroup Systems	This note introduces a new concept of cooperative and adversarial multigroup system, which consists of cooperative leaders and followers, as well as adversaries. For example, cooperation of multiple military vehicles operate in complex dynamic networked environments with unknown enemies and hidden malicious attackers. The lack of global situational awareness in distributed settings makes autonomous vehicles prone to cyberattacks and infiltration. Each agent is unaware of the motives of its neighbors and may receive information/data from both the teammates and the adversaries. Secure and resilient control protocols are essential for the networked multigroup systems to prevent the adversaries' attacks from propagating across the network, which may influence the system performance and even overall stability. To counter sensor faults and attacks from the adversaries, a distributed resilient control architecture is proposed, which guarantees uniform ultimate boundedness of the closed-loop dynamical system. Numerical simulations illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed results.	https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8869852	0
Detection Performance to Spatially Random UAV Using the Ground Vehicle	It is very challenging to detect an unmanned-aerial-vehicle (UAV) when it is applied to launch an attack by the enemy's country, due to its feature of mobility and flexibility. Against this background, in this paper, from wireless communication point of view, we study the detection probability of home country's ground vehicle (GV) to enemy's ground-station (GS)-to-UAV transmission system. We assume that the location of the GV is randomly distributed inside the space confined by the largest detection distance. Moreover, we assume the enemy's UAV is randomly distributed in the coverage space of the GS-to-UAV (G2A) transmission link but also keep the security distance from the GS. To this end, we first characterize the statistical features of the signal-to-noise-ratio (SNR) over the G2V and G2A links. Then, we define detection outage probability (DOP) and average detection capacity (ADC), and show their approximations. Finally, Monte-Carlo simulations are conducted to verify the correctness of our proposed analytical models.	https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9293404	0
Malicious User Detection for Cooperative Mobility Tracking in Autonomous Driving	The mobility status of self and surrounding vehicles provides important information to various tasks in autonomous driving (AD) and intelligent transportation system (ITS). Accordingly, a precise, stable, and robust mobility tracking framework is essential. Compared with self-tracking that relies only on mobility observations from onboard sensors [e.g., global positioning system (GPS), inertial measurement unit (IMU), and camera], cooperative tracking markedly increases the precision and reliability of the mobility information by integrating observations from roadside units (RSUs) and nearby vehicles through vehicle-to-everything (V2X) communications in the Internet of Vehicles (IoV). Nevertheless, cooperative tracking can be quite vulnerable if there are malicious users sending bogus observations in the cooperative network. In this article, we present a malicious user detection framework, which includes two sequential detection algorithms and a secure mobility data exchange and fusion model to detect and remove bogus mobility information and integrate proposed detection algorithms with previous data fusion algorithms, which secures the cooperative mobility tracking in AD, ITS. Simulations validate the effectiveness and robustness of the proposed framework under different types of attacks.	https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8998259	0
A Stabilized Feedback Episodic Memory (SF-EM) and Home Service Provision Framework for Robot and IoT Collaboration	The automated home referred to as Smart Home is expected to offer fully customized services to its residents, reducing the amount of home labor, thus improving human beings' welfare. Service robots and Internet of Things (IoT) play the key roles in the development of Smart Home. The service provision with these two main components in a Smart Home environment requires: 1) learning and reasoning algorithms and 2) the integration of robot and IoT systems. Conventional computational intelligence-based learning and reasoning algorithms do not successfully manage dynamic changes in the Smart Home data, and the simple integrations fail to fully draw the synergies from the collaboration of the two systems. To tackle these limitations, we propose: 1) a stabilized memory network with a feedback mechanism which can learn user behaviors in an incremental manner and 2) a robot-IoT service provision framework for a Smart Home which utilizes the proposed memory architecture as a learning and reasoning module and exploits synergies between the robot and IoT systems. We conduct a set of comprehensive experiments under various conditions to verify the performance of the proposed memory architecture and the service provision framework and analyze the experiment results.	https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8571157	0
SecAuthUAV: A Novel Authentication Scheme for UAV-Ground Station and UAV-UAV Communication	Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) are becoming very popular nowadays due to the emergence of application areas such as the Internet of Drones (IoD). They are finding wide applicability in areas ranging from package delivery systems to automated military applications. Nevertheless, communication security between a UAV and its ground station (GS) is critical for completing its task without leaking sensitive information either to the adversaries or to unauthenticated users. UAVs are especially vulnerable to physical capture and node tampering attacks. Further, since UAV devices are generally equipped with small batteries and limited memory storage, lightweight security techniques are best suited for them. Addressing these issues, a lightweight mutual authentication scheme based on Physical Unclonable Functions (PUFs) for UAV-GS authentication is presented in this paper. The UAV-GS authentication scheme is extended further to support UAV-UAV authentication. We present a formal security analysis as well as old-fashioned cryptanalysis and show that our protocol provides various security features such as mutual authentication, user anonymity, etc, and is resilient against many security attacks such as masquerade, replay, node tampering, and cloning attacks, etc. We also compare the performance of our protocol with state-of-the-art authentication protocols for UAVs, based on computation, communication, and memory storage cost.	https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9237145	0
Optimal Stealthy Deception Attack Against Cyber-Physical Systems	This paper studies the problem of designing the optimal deception attack to maximize a utility function with the Kullback-Leibler divergence adopted as a detection constraint. The utility function reflects the goal of pulling the state away from the origin, increasing the cost of the controller and decreasing the cost of the attacker. To analyze the stealthiness of the attack, the attack signal is decomposed into two parts, one of which is strict stealthy. The necessary and sufficient condition is derived for the case that the strict stealthy attack cannot lead to an unbounded benefit. In this case, the linear transformation of the optimal attack is proved to be a Gaussian distribution. With the mean value and covariance of the Gaussian distribution as variables, the original problem is transformed into a new problem which may not be convex. A suboptimal attack policy is provided and the upper bound for the loss of benefit when using the suboptimal attack is also given. A numerical example of unmanned ground vehicle is illustrated to verify the effectiveness of the proposed attack policy.	https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8709954	0
Exploiting Singular Configurations for Controllable, Low-Power Friction Enhancement on Unmanned Ground Vehicles	This letter describes the design, validation, and performance of a new type of adaptive wheel morphology for unmanned ground vehicles. Our adaptive wheel morphology uses a spiral cam to create a system that enables controllable deployment of high friction surfaces. The overall design is modular, battery powered, and can be mounted directly to the wheels of a vehicle without additional wiring. The use of a tailored cam profile exploits a singular configuration to minimize power consumption when deployed and protects the actuator from external forces. Component-level experiments demonstrate that friction on ice and grass can be increased by up to 170%. Two prototypes were installed on a 1:5 scale, radio-controlled rally car and tested. The devices were able to controllably deploy, increase friction, and greatly improve acceleration capacity on a slippery, synthetic ice surface.	https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9017955	0
Augmenting Vehicle Localization by Cooperative Sensing of the Driving Environment: Insight on Data Association in Urban Traffic Scenarios	Precise vehicle positioning is a key element for the development of Cooperative Intelligent Transport Systems (C-ITS). In this context, we present a distributed processing technique to augment the performance of conventional Global Navigation Satellite Systems (GNSS) exploiting Vehicle-to-anything (V2X) communication systems. We propose a method, referred to as Implicit Cooperative Positioning with Data Association (ICP-DA), where the connected vehicles detect a set of passive features in the driving environment, solve the association task by pairing them with on-board sensor measurements and cooperatively localize the features to enhance the GNSS accuracy. We adopt a belief propagation algorithm to distribute the processing over the network, and solve both the data association and localization problems locally at vehicles. Numerical results on realistic traffic networks show that the ICP-DA method is able to significantly outperform the conventional GNSS. In particular, the analysis on a real urban road infrastructure highlights the robustness of the proposed method in real-life cases where the interactions among vehicles evolve over space and time according to traffic regulation mechanisms. Performances are investigated both in conventional traffic-light regulated scenarios and self-regulated environments (as representative of future automated driving scenarios) where vehicles autonomously cross the intersections taking gap-availability decisions for avoiding collisions. The analysis shows how the mutual coordination in platoons of vehicles eases the cooperation process and increases the positioning performance.	https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8848842	0
SEARCH: An SDN-Enabled Approach for Vehicle Path-Planning	With increasing vehicle density and the growth of accidents in urban areas, navigation management becomes a serious problem. Even though there is a multitude of navigation systems, ambulances, taxis, or even ordinary vehicles, sometimes find it challenging to reach their destinations on time. There are two main reasons for this difficulty: (i) lack of local knowledge of the area of navigation solutions and (ii) their inflexibility against unforeseeable situations that may occur on the roads. Indeed, the majority of navigation solutions are based only on the distance, the journey time, or even statistics related to the density of vehicles to plan the full paths, while neglecting the dynamic nature of the vehicle traffic. Also, their respective centralized architectures are unable to monitor both the traffic and unexpected events continuously and in real-time without not being overloaded by the flow of message exchanges between the road entities and the central processing entity. To address these issues, we propose in this paper a novel three-tier architecture, called SDN-enabled Approach for Vehicle Path-Planning (SEARCH), to enhance the situation awareness on urban roads, efficiently collect traffic information in real-time, and decide the best navigation strategy. The proposed architecture exploits Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs), Vehicular Ad hoc Networks (VANETs), 5G based cellular systems, and Software-Defined Networking (SDN) to provide better and faster communication to changing road conditions. Based on these technologies, some parameters related to vehicles and driving environments, such as speed, distance, traffic jams, incidents, and travel flow, are efficiently collected and dynamically exploited to achieve faster paths between any existing pairs of locations. Furthermore, the deployed architecture of SEARCH can provide sufficient bandwidth to support all data traffic needs to update vehicles during their journey efficiently and in real-time. To evaluate the performance of our architecture, we conduct a series of simulations and perform a set of comparisons with relevant route planning algorithms. We found that the proposed architecture works effectively in terms of saving on driving time to reach any target destinations.	https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9286572	0
Deep reinforcement learning and its application in autonomous fitting optimization for attack areas of UCAVs	The ever-changing battlefield environment requires the use of robust and adaptive technologies integrated into a reliable platform. Unmanned combat aerial vehicles (UCAVs) aim to integrate such advanced technologies while increasing the tactical capabilities of combat aircraft. As a research object, common UCAV uses the neural network fitting strategy to obtain values of attack areas. However, this simple strategy cannot cope with complex environmental changes and autonomously optimize decision-making problems. To solve the problem, this paper proposes a new deep deterministic policy gradient (DDPG) strategy based on deep reinforcement learning for the attack area fitting of UCAVs in the future battlefield. Simulation results show that the autonomy and environmental adaptability of UCAVs in the future battlefield will be improved based on the new DDPG algorithm and the training process converges quickly. We can obtain the optimal values of attack areas in real time during the whole flight with the well-trained deep network.	https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9180140	0
Output-Feedback Image-Based Visual Servoing for Multirotor Unmanned Aerial Vehicle Line Following	This article considers visual servoing-based motion control of multirotor unmanned aerial vehicles. We employ output feedback and image-based visual servoing to control the vehicle's pose with respect to a static planar visual target with a linear structure (e.g., electric transmission lines or pipelines). The method uses measurements from inexpensive sensors typically found on-board: an inertial measurement unit, and a monocular computer vision system. Unlike existing work, it does not require linear velocity, position measurements, or an optical flow sensor. The method directly controls the relative pose to the visual target and does not require global navigation satellite system measurements of the vehicle or target. The visual servoing method ensures the vehicle flies centered above the lines at specified height and yaw. Such motion control is important in a number of applications such as efficient data collection for infrastructure inspection. Our article exploits the inherent robustness of an image-based approach where feature error is computed directly in the image plane. A virtual camera is combined with output feedback and convergence of the closed loop is proven. The method is adaptive to vehicle mass, thrust constant, desired depth, and a constant disturbance force. Simulation and experimental results illustrate the method's performance and robustness to model uncertainty.	https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8962957	0
The Safety Potential of Lane Keeping Assistance and Possible Actions to Improve the Potential	Before widespread automated driving, driver assistance systems become more common and can deliver safety benefits. This study focuses on current and future lane keeping assistance (LKA) systems and their potential safety effects by analysing real-world crash data and LKA's possibilities to prevent fatal passenger car crashes. The analysed data includes in-depth analysis of 364 fatal head-on and single-vehicle crashes in Finland. According to statistical analysis, 27% of these crashes could potentially have been prevented had currently available LKA been deployed. In this study, many issues are examined related to the lane markings' visibility, infrastructure, weather, and driver-related risks, which rationalise the results, compliment previous research, and highlight possibilities to increase the safety potential of LKA. Related to the lane markings' visibility, safety potential could be improved by allocating more resources to road maintenance and to snow clearance. Advanced LKA enabling exploiting digital lane markings could hypothetically almost double the safety potential as weather conditions or the visibility of lane markings would not restrict LKA's operation. While the driver is still in charge of driving tasks, driver-related risks are difficult to manage and the crashes caused intendedly or due to driver's attack of illness are not preventable by current LKA systems.	https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9084279	0
DiversityGAN: Diversity-Aware Vehicle Motion Prediction via Latent Semantic Sampling	Vehicle trajectory prediction is crucial for autonomous driving and advanced driver assistant systems. While existing approaches may sample from a predicted distribution of vehicle trajectories, they lack the ability to explore it – a key ability for evaluating safety from a planning and verification perspective. In this work, we devise a novel approach for generating realistic and diverse vehicle trajectories. We first extend the generative adversarial network (GAN) framework with a low-dimensional approximate semantic space, and shape that space to capture semantics such as merging and turning. We then sample from this space in a way that mimics the predicted distribution, but allows us to control coverage of semantically distinct outcomes. We validate our approach on a publicly available dataset and show results that achieve state-of-the-art prediction performance, while providing improved coverage of the space of predicted trajectory semantics.	https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9127831	0
Protecting an Autonomous Delivery Agent Against a Vision-Guided Adversary: Algorithms and Experimental Results	Safety considerations call for deployment of autonomous ground vehicles in defense and high risk zones for transport of goods from one point to another. Such vehicles face the threat of an intelligent autonomous adversary that may disrupt the transfer of material. This article investigates the challenges involved in autonomous protection of a delivery agent, via a land-based rescue agent, before interception of the delivery agent by the adversary occurs. In particular, we study how effectively an adversary equipped with a vision sensor can be handled by an autonomous rescue agent operating without vision support and relying only on wireless communication with the delivery agent. Taking capabilities and weights of the three vehicles into account, the delivery agent is assumed to be the slowest while the adversary operates at the highest speed among the three vehicles. A geometric framework based on Apollonius circles is proposed to analyze the interaction between the delivery and rescue agents. The adversary's speed and its moves (based on the direction of the delivery agent) are taken into account, along with the Apollonius circles for the rescue-delivery agent pair, to determine the possibility of capture. Regions in the plane where the delivery and rescue agents can meet, prior to a capture by the adversary, are obtained to compute safe regions for the delivery agent. Algorithms adopted by the delivery agent, rescue agent, and the adversary are described. We, then, explore the challenges in rescue of multiple delivery agents from a vision-guided adversary by introducing additional rescue agents. In particular, we study protection of k delivery agents (from an adversary) via k rescue agents. Algorithms to compute 1) multiple meeting points, one each for a delivery agent-rescue agent pair and 2) the strategy of the adversary to capture any one of the k delivery agents are presented. Experiments with multiple agents show that the delivery and rescue agents can execute their strategies using simply low-end microcontrollers without external memory.	https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8930280	0
Observer-Based Control for Cyber-Physical Systems With Periodic DoS Attacks via a Cyclic Switching Strategy	This article studies the observer-based output feedback control problem for a class of cyber-physical systems with periodic denial-of-service (DoS) attacks, where the attacks coexist both in the measurement and control channels in the network scenario. The periodic DoS attacks are characterized by a cyclic dwell-time switching strategy, such that the resulting augmented system can be converted into a class of discrete-time cyclic dwell-time switched systems including a stable subsystem and an unstable subsystem. By means of a cyclic piecewise linear Lyapunov function approach, the exponential stability and $l_2$-gain analysis, and observer-based controller design are carried out for the augmented discrete-time cyclic switched system. Then, the desired observer and controller gains in piecewise linear form are determined simultaneously so as to ensure that the resulting closed-loop system is exponentially stable with a prescribed $\mathcal {H}_{\infty }$ performance index. Finally, a practical application of unmanned ground vehicles under periodic DoS attacks is provided to verify the effectiveness of the developed control approach.	https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8897656	0
Real-Time Sensor Anomaly Detection and Identification in Automated Vehicles	Connected and automated vehicles (CAVs) are expected to revolutionize the transportation industry, mainly through allowing for a real-time and seamless exchange of information between vehicles and roadside infrastructure. Although connectivity and automation are projected to bring about a vast number of benefits, they can give rise to new challenges in terms of safety, security, and privacy. To navigate roadways, CAVs need to heavily rely on their sensor readings and the information received from other vehicles and roadside units. Hence, anomalous sensor readings caused by either malicious cyber attacks or faulty vehicle sensors can result in disruptive consequences and possibly lead to fatal crashes. As a result, before the mass implementation of CAVs, it is important to develop methodologies that can detect anomalies and identify their sources seamlessly and in real time. In this paper, we develop an anomaly detection approach through combining a deep learning method, namely convolutional neural network (CNN), with a well-established anomaly detection method, and Kalman filtering with a χ2-detector, to detect and identify anomalous behavior in CAVs. Our numerical experiments demonstrate that the developed approach can detect anomalies and identify their sources with high accuracy, sensitivity, and F1 score. In addition, this developed approach outperforms the anomaly detection and identification capabilities of both CNNs and Kalman filtering with a χ2-detector method alone. It is envisioned that this research will contribute to the development of safer and more resilient CAV systems that implement a holistic view toward intelligent transportation system (ITS) concepts.	https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8684317	0
An Analysis of the Tradeoff Between Fuel Consumption and Ride Comfort for the Pulse and Glide Driving Strategy	Pulse and glide (PnG) is a driving strategy that controls vehicles in a more fuel-efficient way than driving at a constant speed does. It can be applied by the driver or, which is more likely, by an automated system with autonomy level one or higher. During the pulse phase, the vehicle is accelerated to operate the combustion engine and transmission at higher efficiency. During the following glide phase, the vehicle decelerates and the engine is decoupled from the drive train. The optimal pulse and glide strategy - as addressed in previous studies - implies high acceleration values and abrupt transitions between pulse and glide, which both degrade the ride comfort. A driveability study on PnG conducted recently identified that the acceleration, the jerk during the transitions and the duration of the glide phase have to be limited to reach the desired level of ride comfort. Thresholds have been derived for a level-eight calibration, i.e. a PnG operation that is noticeable only to skeptical customers. We use the results of the study to also provide thresholds for a level-seven calibration, i.e. a PnG operation that is noticeable to all customers without being disturbing. Subsequently, we establish a correlation between ride comfort and fuel consumption by comparing the fuel savings of three different driveability calibrations: level eight, level seven and a calibration without driveability constraints. The simulations are performed for a D-segment vehicle and two different gasoline engines. With reference to constant speed, the fuel savings of the level-seven calibration are larger than 30% below 40 km/h, decreasing gradually with increasing speed. They are around ten percent higher than those of the level-eight calibration and only a few percent lower than those of a PnG operation without driveability constraints. Hence, the level-seven calibration can nearly exploit the maximal fuel-saving potential of PnG, and, as it is not disturbing, should be considered for practical applications of PnG. The PnG strategy can be applied to any vehicle equipped with a combustion engine that features the engine-off functionality, which is the case for mild and full hybrids and for some micro hybrids. However, considering that the benefit of PnG increases with increasing engine size, the fuel saving potential of PnG is highest for micro and mild hybrids as these vehicles are commonly equipped with larger engines than full hybrids.	https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9093209	0
HDMI-Loc: Exploiting High Definition Map Image for Precise Localization via Bitwise Particle Filter	In this letter, we propose a method for accurately estimating the 6-Degree Of Freedom (DOF) pose in an urban environment when a High Definition (HD) map is available. An HD map expresses 3D geometric data with semantic information in a compressed format and thus is more memory-efficient than point cloud maps. The small capacity of HD maps can be a significant advantage for autonomous vehicles in terms of map storage and updates within a large urban area. Unfortunately, existing approaches failed to sufficiently exploit HD maps by only estimating partial pose. In this study, we present a full 6-DOF localization against an HD map using an onboard stereo camera with semantic information from roads. We introduce an 8-bit representation for road information, which allow for effective bitwise operation when matching between query data and the HD map. For the pose estimation, we leverage a particle filter followed by a full 6-DOF pose optimization. Our experimental results show a median error of approximately 0.3 m in the lateral and longitudinal directions for a drive of approximately 11 km. These results can be used by autonomous vehicles to correct the global position without using Global Positioning System (GPS) data in highly complex urban environments. The median operation speed is approximately 60 msec supporting 10 Hz.	https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9158353	0
Real-Time Fusion Network for RGB-D Semantic Segmentation Incorporating Unexpected Obstacle Detection for Road-Driving Images	Semantic segmentation has made striking progress due to the success of deep convolutional neural networks. Considering the demands of autonomous driving, real-time semantic segmentation has become a research hotspot these years. However, few real-time RGB-D fusion semantic segmentation studies are carried out despite readily accessible depth information nowadays. In this letter, we propose a real-time fusion semantic segmentation network termed RFNet that effectively exploits complementary cross-modal information. Building on an efficient network architecture, RFNet is capable of running swiftly, which satisfies autonomous vehicles applications. Multi-dataset training is leveraged to incorporate unexpected small obstacle detection, enriching the recognizable classes required to face unforeseen hazards in the real world. A comprehensive set of experiments demonstrates the effectiveness of our framework. On Cityscapes, Our method outperforms previous state-of-the-art semantic segmenters, with excellent accuracy and 22 Hz inference speed at the full 2048 × 1024 resolution, outperforming most existing RGB-D networks.	https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9134735	0
Unified Biometric Privacy Preserving Three-Factor Authentication and Key Agreement for Cloud-Assisted Autonomous Vehicles	Autonomous vehicles (AVs) are increasingly common, although there remain a number of limitations that need to be addressed in order for their deployment to be more widespread. For example, to mitigate the failure of self-driving functions in AVs, introducing the remote control capability (which allows a human driver to operate the vehicle remotely in certain circumferences) is one of several countermeasures proposed. However, the remote control capability breaks the isolation of onboard driving systems and can be potentially exploited by malicious actors to take over control of the AVs; thus, risking the safety of the passengers and pedestrians (e.g., AVs are remotely taken over by terrorist groups to carry out coordinated attacks in places of mass gatherings). Therefore, security is a key, mandatory feature in the design of AVs. In this paper, we propose a cloud-centric three-factor authentication and key agreement protocol (CT-AKA) integrating passwords, biometrics and smart cards to ensure secure access to both cloud and AVs. Three typical biometric encryption approaches, including fuzzy vault, fuzzy commitment, and fuzzy extractor, are unified to achieve three-factor authentication without leaking the biometric privacy of users. Moreover, two session keys are negotiated in our protocol, namely: one between the user and AV to support secure remote control of the AV, and the other is negotiated between the mobile device and the cloud to introduce resilience to the compromise of ephemeral security parameters to ensure cloud data access security with a high security guarantee. Finally, we formally verify the security properties and evaluate the efficiency of CT-AKA, whose findings demonstrate that the protocol achieves high security strength with reasonable computation and communication costs.	https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8979385	0
A Robust Predictive Control Approach for Underwater Robotic Vehicles	This article presents a robust nonlinear model predictive control (NMPC) scheme for autonomous navigation of underwater robotic vehicles operating in a constrained workspace including the static obstacles. In particular, the purpose of the controller is to guide the vehicle toward specific way points with guaranteed input and state constraints. Various constraints, such as obstacles, workspace boundaries, predefined upper bounds for the velocity of the robotic vehicle, and thruster saturations, are considered during the control design. Moreover, the proposed control scheme is designed at dynamic level, and it incorporates the full dynamics of the vehicle in which the ocean currents are also involved. Hence, taking the thrusts as the control inputs of the robotic system and formulating them accordingly, the vehicle exploits the ocean current dynamics when these are in favor of the way-point tracking mission, resulting in reduced energy consumption by the thrusters. The robustness of the closed-loop system against parameter uncertainties has been analytically guaranteed with convergence properties. The performance of the proposed control strategy is experimentally verified using a 4 degrees of freedom (DoF) underwater robotic vehicle inside a constrained test tank with sparse static obstacles.	https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8858028	0
Cooperative Routing for an Air–Ground Vehicle Team—Exact Algorithm, Transformation Method, and Heuristics	This paper considers a cooperative vehicle routing problem for an intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance mission in the presence of communication constraints between the vehicles. The proposed framework uses a ground vehicle and an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) that travel cooperatively and visit a set of targets while satisfying the communication constraints. The problem is formulated as a mixed-integer linear program, and a branch-and-cut algorithm is developed to solve the problem to optimality. Furthermore, a transformation method and a heuristic are also developed for the problem. The effectiveness of all the algorithms is corroborated through extensive computational experiments on several randomly generated instances. This paper is motivated by an intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance mission involving a single unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) and a ground vehicle, where the vehicles must coordinate their activity in the presence of communication constraints. The combination of a small UAV and a ground vehicle is an ideal platform for such missions, since small UAVs can fly at low altitudes and can avoid obstacles or threats that would be problematic for the ground vehicle alone. This paper addresses the coordinated routing problem involving these two vehicles and presents an algorithm to obtain an optimal solution for this problem, fast heuristics to obtain good feasible solutions, and also a transformation method to transform any instance of this cooperative vehicle routing problem to an instance of the one-in-a-set traveling salesman problem.	https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8798870	0
Energy-Efficient Mobile Crowdsensing by Unmanned Vehicles: A Sequential Deep Reinforcement Learning Approach	Mobile crowdsensing (MCS) is an attractive and innovative paradigm in which a crowd of users equipped with smart mobile devices (such as smartphones and iPads), and more recently unmanned vehicles (UVs, e.g., driverless cars and drones) conduct sensing tasks in mobile social networks by fully exploiting their carried diverse embedded sensors. These devices, especially UVs, are usually constrained by limited sensing range and energy reserve of devices, which contribute to the restriction of one single UV task performance, and thus UV collaborations are fully favored. In this article, we explicitly consider navigating a group of UVs to collect different kinds of data in a city, with the presence of multiple charging stations. Different from the existing approaches that solve the problem by forming a constrained optimization problem, we propose a novel sequential deep model called “PPO+LSTM,” which contains a sequential model LSTM and is trained with proximal policy optimization (PPO), for assigning tasks and planning route. We evaluate our model in different network settings when comparing with other state-of-the-art solutions, and we also show the impact of important hyperparameters of our model. Results show that our solution outperforms all others in terms of energy efficiency, data collection ratio, and geographic fairness.	https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8944303	0
Curb Detection and Tracking in Low-Resolution 3D Point Clouds Based on Optimization Framework	Curb detection and tracking is an essential component of autonomous vehicle operation in urban environments. Detecting curbs is a particularly challenging task in urban environments that contain countless dynamic objects. Previous studies have approached curb detection using different types of sensor such as cameras, radar, and LIDAR. Among these, LIDAR sensors have superior advantages in regard to detecting curbs because of their robustness in different weather conditions and they can provide accurate distance measurements. Previous methods based on LIDAR have exploited high-resolution 3D point clouds using high-cost LIDARs. However, the processing of large volumes of information is inefficient for autonomous driving technologies because of real time constraints. This paper presents a novel real-time curb detection and tracking algorithm that makes use of a low-resolution LIDAR. The proposed method consists of three steps. First is the extraction of curb candidates based on Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and Density-Based Spatial Clustering of Applications with Noise (DBSCAN). Second is the selection of the optimal candidate using an optimization framework. Lastly is the tracking of the detected curbs. In the tracking module, we use a combination of spatial consistency and validation gate to track the curb in the occlusion region with dynamic objects. Experiments on a public dataset show that the proposed method achieved 91.54% and 89.76% F1 score on the straight and curved road while running at about 18 ms per frame, thereby outperforming the state-of-the-art by a large margin. In addition, we integrated the proposed method with the localization module of our autonomous driving platform. The localization module integrated with the proposed method reduces the positional and lateral root mean square (RMS) error of the vehicle localization by 3.58% and 6.68% respectively. In addition, we compare this method with a deep neural network based method from the perspective of a safety-critical system such as self-driving cars.	https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8826330	0
A Novel Method for Protecting Swimmers and Surfers From Shark Attacks Using Communicating Autonomous Drones	Shark attacks can make beach tourists anxious about sharing the ocean with apex predators. Although the raw number of shark attacks is deficient, the absolute terror caused by sharks is genuine. This article introduces a novel method named as the “drone shark shield system,” which uses communicating autonomous drones to intervene and prevent shark attacks for protecting swimmers and surfers. We detail the design of the drone shark shield system and the strategy for repelling sharks through multiple intersections. A shark interception algorithm is developed to guide drones to predicted intersection points for deterring sharks. Computer simulations are conducted to illustrate our method.	https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9068241	0
Deceiving Image-to-Image Translation Networks for Autonomous Driving With Adversarial Perturbations	Deep neural networks (DNNs) have achieved impressive performance on handling computer vision problems. However, it has been found that DNNs are vulnerable to adversarial examples. For such reason, adversarial perturbations have been recently studied in several respects. However, most previous works have focused on image classification tasks, and it has never been studied regarding adversarial perturbations on Image-to-image (Im2Im) translation tasks, showing great success in handling paired and/or unpaired mapping problems in the field of autonomous driving and robotics. This letter examines different types of adversarial perturbations that can fool Im2Im frameworks for autonomous driving purposes. We propose both quasi-physical and digital adversarial perturbations that can make Im2Im models yield unexpected results. We then empirically analyze these perturbations and show that they generalize well under both paired for image synthesis and unpaired settings for style transfer. We also validate that there exist some perturbation thresholds over which the Im2Im mapping is disrupted or impossible. The existence of these perturbations reveals that there exist crucial weaknesses in Im2Im models. Lastly, we show that our methods illustrate how perturbations affect the quality of outputs, pioneering the improvement of the robustness of current SOTA networks for autonomous driving.	https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8962221	0
Anti-Jamming 3D Trajectory Design for UAV-Enabled Wireless Sensor Networks Under Probabilistic LoS Channel	This paper investigates the anti-jamming three-dimensional (3D) trajectory design to safeguard the legitimate communications of unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV)-enabled wireless sensor networks (WSNs). Specifically, a UAV is dispatched to collect data over multiple ground sensors (GSs) in the presence of a malicious ground jammer. Under the practical probabilistic line-of-sight (LoS) channel model, we aim to maximize the minimum (average) expected rate among GSs over a finite flight period, by jointly optimizing the GS transmission scheduling, the UAV horizontal and vertical trajectories. To make the formulated non-convex problem tractable, we provide an achievable lower bound for the expected rate, based on which an efficient iterative algorithm is proposed to solve it suboptimally by exploiting the block coordinate descent and successive convex approximation techniques. Numerical results show the significant rate improvement of the proposed joint design and provide new insights into the anti-jamming 3D trajectory design under the probabilistic LoS model, as compared to the conventional two-dimensional (2D) UAV trajectory or under LoS channel models.	https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9271902	0
Poisoning and Evasion Attacks Against Deep Learning Algorithms in Autonomous Vehicles	With the ongoing development and improvement of deep learning technology, autonomous vehicles (AVs) have made tremendous progress in recent years. Despite its great potential, AV supported by deep learning technology still faces numerous security threats, which prevent AV from being putting into large-scale practice. Aiming at this challenging situation, in this paper, we would like to exploit two attacks against deep learning algorithms in traffic sign recognition system by leveraging particle swarm optimization. Specifically, we first exploit the PAPSO (poisoning attack with particle swarm optimization) which focuses on the training process of the deep learning algorithms in the traffic sign recognition system, i.e., the attacker injects crafted samples into the training dataset, causing a reduction in classification accuracy of the traffic sign recognition system. Then, we also explore the EAPSO (evasion attack with particle swarm optimization) which on the other hand focuses on the interference process of the deep learning algorithms, i.e., the attacker adds some hardly perceptible perturbations to the targeted test sample, leading to a misclassification on it. Extensive experiments are conducted to shed light on the effectiveness of our attacks, and some corresponding defense strategies are also presented.	https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9019666	0
Impacts of Constrained Sensing and Communication Based Attacks on Vehicular Platoons	Vehicular platooning promises to bring a faster, safer, and more efficient transportation. Automated platooned vehicles will rely on information obtained from inter-vehicle communication channels and on-board sensors to make driving decisions and achieve platooning. However, such reliance creates an opportunity for safety violating attacks intended to disrupt the platoon formation and cause accidents. In this work, we investigate more realistic attacks mounted against the communication and sensing functionalities of platooned vehicles. More specifically, we are interested in approximating the set of final unsafe states, that can be reached by mounting realistically constrained attacks capable of introducing delay and injecting false-data against the aforementioned functionalities. For that purpose, we will use reachability analysis which enables us to realize whether it is possible to drive the platoon from initial to final states given performance and physical bounds. Our results suggest that these two types of attack are able to steer the platoon towards dangerous states and generate impacts on passengers' safety by causing crashes at high speeds.	https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9037093	0
Optimal Time-Consuming Path Planning for Autonomous Underwater Vehicles Based on a Dynamic Neural Network Model in Ocean Current Environments	Path planning is a prerequisite for autonomous underwater vehicles to perform tasks autonomously. Many shortest distance algorithms are applied, and ocean currents are ignored to plan a short path in distance, which is usually time and energy consuming. In fact, the favourable currents can be exploited while avoiding the opposite ocean flows. Based on the bioinspired neural network architecture, this paper proposes a novel dynamic neural network model to plan the time-saving path in ocean current environments. After that, the path is smoothed by the B-spline algorithm. Analysis of the model shows that it can find out the minimum time path. Many simulations have also been introduced to test the effectiveness of the proposed model, showing good results. The dynamic neural network model has no learning procedure and can run in parallel. It has the advantages of loose parameter restrictions and wide spreading of neural activities. In addition, it has also been proven to be suitable for strong ocean currents.	https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9244620	0
Probabilistic Crowd GAN: Multimodal Pedestrian Trajectory Prediction Using a Graph Vehicle-Pedestrian Attention Network	Understanding and predicting the intention of pedestrians is essential to enable autonomous vehicles and mobile robots to navigate crowds. This problem becomes increasingly complex when we consider the uncertainty and multimodality of pedestrian motion, as well as the implicit interactions between members of a crowd, including any response to a vehicle. Our approach, Probabilistic Crowd GAN, extends recent work in trajectory prediction, combining Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) with Mixture Density Networks (MDNs) to output probabilistic multimodal predictions, from which likely modal paths are found and used for adversarial training. We also propose the use of Graph Vehicle-Pedestrian Attention Network (GVAT), which models social interactions and allows input of a shared vehicle feature, showing that inclusion of this module leads to improved trajectory prediction both with and without the presence of a vehicle. Through evaluation on various datasets, we demonstrate improvements on the existing state of the art methods for trajectory prediction and illustrate how the true multimodal and uncertain nature of crowd interactions can be directly modelled.	https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9123560	0
A Hybrid Command Governor Scheme for Rotary Wings Unmanned Aerial Vehicles	In this paper, we develop an obstacle avoidance control scheme for autonomous aerial vehicles. The strategy is based on command governor (CG) ideas that are here extended to take into account nonconvex constraints typically arising in path planning obstacle avoidance problems. As one of its main merits, the collision avoidance task is accomplished by exploiting convex inner approximations of the obstacle-free region and an ad hoc constraints switching procedure which significantly reduces the online computations pertaining to the CG design. Experimental results on the quadrotor Qball-X4 show the applicability and effectiveness of the proposed approach.	https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8550656	0
Online Computation Offloading and Traffic Routing for UAV Swarms in Edge-Cloud Computing	Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) swarms are widely applied for service provisioning in many domains such as topographic mapping and traffic monitoring. These UAV applications are complicated as they demand not only huge computational resources but also strict latency requirements. However, due to the limited onboard resources of UAVs as well as various dynamics of applications and environments, it's challenging to obtain a feasible computation offloading policy in online environments. To cope with these problems, we propose an online algorithm for UAV swarms to jointly optimize the computation offloading and multi-hop routing scheduling in the Edge-Cloud environment. First, we propose a UAV-Edge-Cloud computing model to meet the requirements of latency and computing capability. We then formulate a joint optimization of workflow assignment and multi-hop routing scheduling in order to minimize the computation cost and latency. To tackle this NP-hard problem, an algorithm based on the Markov approximation technique is designed to obtain near-optimal solutions. Furthermore, to achieve high long-term performance in online environments, we exploit Lyapunov optimization to control the migration cost caused by the dynamics of application and environment. Finally, extensive simulation results demonstrate that our approach achieves a long-term high-efficiency and stable performance in an online environment for UAV swarms with respect to computation offloading and traffic routing.	https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9093980	0
Enhanced Object Detection With Deep Convolutional Neural Networks for Advanced Driving Assistance	Object detection is a critical problem for advanced driving assistance systems (ADAS). Recently, convolutional neural networks (CNN) achieved large successes on object detection, with performance improvement over traditional approaches, which use hand-engineered features. However, due to the challenging driving environment (e.g., large object scale variation, object occlusion, and bad light conditions), popular CNN detectors do not achieve very good object detection accuracy over the KITTI autonomous driving benchmark dataset. In this paper, we propose three enhancements for CNN-based visual object detection for ADAS. To address the large object scale variation challenge, deconvolution and fusion of CNN feature maps are proposed to add context and deeper features for better object detection at low feature map scales. In addition, soft non-maximal suppression (NMS) is applied across object proposals at different feature scales to address the object occlusion challenge. As the cars and pedestrians have distinct aspect ratio features, we measure their aspect ratio statistics and exploit them to set anchor boxes properly for better object matching and localization. The proposed CNN enhancements are evaluated with various image input sizes by experiments over KITTI dataset. The experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed enhancements with good detection performance over KITTI test set.	https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8694965	0
The Optimal Distance Threshold for Fractional Frequency Reuse in Size-Scalable Networks	In the fractional frequency reuse (FFR) system, the bandwidth is partitioned into orthogonal subbands such that users in the cell-center region use the subbands of a frequency reuse factor (FR factor) equal to 1, whereas users in the cell-edge region exploit the subbands of an FR factor larger than 1. The distance threshold, which is used to distinguish the cell-edge region from the cell-center region, is an important factor in FFR system performance. In this paper, we study the optimal distance threshold to maximize system throughput in the downlink cellular networks, including aerial base stations. Subject to the constraint that a given target outage probability is satisfied, the optimal distance threshold is analyzed as a function of the cell size. It is proven that when the sizes of all cells in the network are scaled at the same rate, the optimal distance threshold normalized by the cell size is nondecreasing in the cell size. The analytical results in this paper provide a system design guideline for initial planning of FFR cellular networks of different sizes, including macro, pico, and femto systems. In particular, for size-scalable aerial networks comprising base stations in the sky, such as balloons or unmanned aerial vehicles, our analysis offers insight into the design of the distance threshold with regard to the cell size.	https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8863946	0
On the Design of Conditional Privacy Preserving Batch Verification-Based Authentication Scheme for Internet of Vehicles Deployment	In the Internet of Vehicles (IoV), secure information sharing among vehicles is crucial in order to upgrade driving safety as well as to strengthen vehicular services. However, public communication among vehicles leads to various potential attacks, such as replay, man-in-the-middle, impersonation, unlinkability and traceability attacks. To address this issue, we design a new conditional privacy preserving batch verification-based authentication mechanism in the IoV environment using Elliptic Curve Cryptography (ECC) technique, where a vehicle can authenticate its neighbor vehicle and also a Road-Side Unit (RSU) can authenticate its nearby vehicles in a batch. The proposed scheme is shown to be highly secure against a passive/active adversary through various security analysis, such as random oracle based formal security, formal security verification via automated simulation tool, and also informal security analysis. An exhaustive comparative analysis reveals that the proposed scheme offers better security and functionality attributes, and comparable storage, communication and computation overheads when these are compared with the relevant schemes.	https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9042206	0
Self-Energized UAV-Assisted Scheme for Cooperative Wireless Relay Networks	Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) have recently been envisaged as an enabling technology of 5G. UAVs act as an intermediate relay node to facilitate uninterrupted, high quality communication between information sources and their destination. However, UAV energy management has been a major issue of consideration due to limited power supply, affecting flight duration. Thus, we introduce in this paper a unified energy management framework by resorting to wireless power transfer (WPT), simultaneous wireless information and power transfer (SWIPT) and self-interference (SI) energy harvesting (EH) schemes, in cooperative relay communications. In our new technique, UAVs are deployed as relays equipped with a decode and forward protocol and EH capability operating in a full-duplex (FD) mode. The UAV assists information transmission between a terrestrial base station and a user. The UAV's transmission capability is powered exclusively by the energy harvested from WPT, radio frequency signal transmitted from the source via time-switching SWIPT protocol and SI exploitation. We improve the overall system throughput by the use of FD based UAV-assisted cooperative system. In this proposed system, we formulate two optimization problems to minimize end-to-end outage probability, subject to UAV's power profile and trajectory for a DF relay scheme, respectively. The KKT conditions have been used to obtain closed-form solutions for the two formulated problems. Numerical simulation results validate all the theoretical results. We demonstrate that the performance of our proposed unified EH scheme outperforms that of existing techniques in the literature.	https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8892608	0
Graph-Based File Dispatching Protocol With D2D-Enhanced UAV-NOMA Communications in Large-Scale Networks	As a newly emerging communication assistant equipment, unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) can be exploited to dispatch data files quickly to specific areas and support rapid deployment of communication links in complex terrain, which is of great significance for specific communication demands in disaster and remote areas. Nonorthogonal multiple access (NOMA), as a rosy technology in the fifth generation (5G) and future mobile communication systems, has been widely studied because of its ability in improving spectral efficiency and reducing transmission latency to enhance the overall Quality of Service (QoS) and meet the strict communication requirements. Based on these, in this article, we propose a device-to-device (D2D)-enhanced UAV-NOMA network architecture, in which D2D is introduced to increase the file dispatching efficiency. In our proposed D2D-enhanced UAV-NOMA network, the ground users (GUEs) that have already received file blocks (FBs) are allowed to reuse the time-frequency resources assigned to NOMA links to share their FBs with other GUEs, which significantly improves the efficiency of file dispatching. But this also leads to a complicated interference environment. In order to effectively manage the interference and minimize the UAV-assisted file dispatching mission time, we propose a graph-based file dispatching (GFD) protocol, in which the complicated joint optimization problem is decomposed to be solved efficiently and graph theory-based algorithms are proposed for resource allocation. The simulation results verify the advantages of our proposed D2D-enhanced UAV-NOMA network architecture and the efficiency of our designed GFD protocol in minimizing the total UAV-assisted file dispatching mission time.	https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9094242	0
A Data-Driven Approach to Prediction and Optimal Bucket-Filling Control for Autonomous Excavators	We develop a data-driven, statistical control method for autonomous excavators. Interactions between soil and an excavator bucket are highly complex and nonlinear, making traditional physical modeling difficult to use for real-time control. Here, we propose a data-driven method, exploiting data obtained from laboratory tests. We use the data to construct a nonlinear, non-parametric statistical model for predicting the behavior of soil scooped by an excavator bucket. The prediction model is built for controlling the amount of soil collected with a bucket. An excavator collects soil by dragging the bucket along the soil surface and scooping the soil by rotating the bucket. It is important to switch from the drag phase to the scoop phase with the correct timing to ensure an appropriate amount of soil has accumulated in front of the bucket. We model the process as a heteroscedastic Gaussian process (GP) based on the observation that the variance of the collected soil mass depends on the scooping trajectory, i.e., the input, as well as the shape of the soil surface immediately prior to scooping. We develop an optimal control algorithm for switching from the drag phase to the scoop phase at an appropriate time and for generating a scoop trajectory to capture a desired amount of soil with high confidence. We implement the method on a robotic excavator and collect experimental data. Experiments show promising results in terms of being able to achieve a desired bucket fill factor with low variance.	https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8972589	0
VeRA: A Simplified Security Risk Analysis Method for Autonomous Vehicles	Risk analysis/assessment is an indispensable process during the design and development of Autonomous Vehicles (AVs), which is in charge of evaluating whether the risk of an attack is critical or minor. However, current risk analysis methods either are time-consuming or not suitable for Connected and Autonomous Vehicles (CAVs). In this paper, an efficient security risk analysis method, Vehicles Risk Analysis (VeRA), is proposed, fitting for evaluating the risks of attacks in the context of AV and CAVs. VeRA firstly considers the human capabilities and vehicle automation level to conduct a security risk analysis. Meanwhile, compared to the benchmark (i.e., SAE J3061), VeRA uses a simplified analysis process and fewer factors, significantly reducing the required analysis time without affecting analysis accuracy. Moreover, based on VeRA, a simple but efficient mathematical model is established to assess the risk value by considering the attack probability, severity and human control, avoiding the tedious process of looking up tables in previous methods. A case study on a general AV model shows that VeRA not only captures the critical attacks as accurate as other methods, but also analyzes the changes of human controllability with the vehicle's automation level. The performance compared to other available methods shows that VeRA can obtain the same analysis results by using around 43% less time than the benchmark.	https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9140383	0

Learning the Time-Varying Massive MIMO Channels: Robust Estimation and Data-Aided Prediction	The quasi-static assumption of channels becomes invalid in a number of emerging applications of massive multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) systems with high base station (BS)/user mobility, such as high speed train and unmanned aerial vehicle communications. In these situations, the time variation of channels shortens the channel coherence time and decreases the efficiency of traditional channel estimation schemes significantly. This paper focuses on the time-varying channel estimation problem in massive MIMO systems, where the mobility of BS/user is assumed to be high. The sparse property of the time-varying massive MIMO channels is analyzed, which reveals that the angular domain channels exhibit two kinds of spatial-temporal sparse (STS) structures, namely the temporal-common sparse structure and spatial-clustered sparse structure. By exploiting the STS structures, a novel structured variational Bayesian inference (VBI) framework is formulated to make a robust channel estimation during the training phase. A data-aided channel predication scheme is further proposed to combat the time variation of the channels during the data transmission phase without increasing the pilot consumption. The simulation results demonstrate the superiority of the proposed scheme in the time-varying scenarios with different BS/user mobilities.	https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8966466	0
Exploiting Redundancy for Reliability Analysis of Sensor Perception in Automated Driving Vehicles	For automated driving, the perception provided by lidar, radar, and camera sensors is safety-critical. Validating sensor perception reliability with standard empirical tests is impractical, owing to the large required test effort and the need for a reference truth to identify sensor errors. To address these challenges, we investigate the possibility of estimating sensor perception reliability without a reference truth. In particular, we propose a framework to learn sensor perception reliability solely by exploiting sensor redundancies. We formulate a likelihood function for redundant binary sensor data without a reference truth and propose a Gaussian copula to model dependent sensor errors. Synthetic numerical experiments show that under an adequate dependence model, correct sensor perception reliabilities can be estimated without a reference truth. Because the selection of an adequate dependence model is challenging without a reference truth, we also investigate how inadequate dependence models influence the estimation. The proposed framework is a step toward the validation of sensor perception reliability because it could enable the learning of reliabilities from a fleet of driver-controlled vehicles equipped with series sensors.	https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8886711	0
Incentivizing Resource Cooperation for Blockchain Empowered Wireless Power Transfer in UAV Networks	In unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) networks, UAVs-assisted wireless power transfer is a promising approach to charge low-power smart devices for energy replenishment. However, security and privacy concerns associated with the energy micro-transactions in untrusted wireless trading environment present serious challenges. In this paper, we exploit Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) and consortium blockchain to propose a new distributed and secure UAVs-assisted wireless power transfer framework named aerial-ground chain, where heterogeneous consensus is developed to verify the energy micro-transactions. Specifically, the UAVs verify energy micro-transactions simultaneously but asynchronously to form an aerial tangle. The smart devices also participate in maintaining the aerial tangle. We define timeout for the energy micro-transactions, and leverage a set of Access Points (APs) to cooperatively confirm the timeout energy micro-transaction by utilizing consortium blockchain, to form a ground main chain. Furthermore, a contract theory based resource cooperation scheme is designed to motivate the UAVs to participate in wireless power transfer, and to incentivize the APs to contribute their resources in cooperatively verifying the timeout energy micro-transactions. Security analysis and numerical results illustrate that the developed aerial-ground chain and the designed contract theory based resource cooperation scheme are secure and efficient for UAVs-assisted wireless power transfer.	https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9250682	0
Robust Autonomous Navigation of Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) for Warehouses’ Inventory Application	The inventory inspection using autonomous unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) is beneficial in terms of cost, time, and safety of human workers. However, in typical warehouses, it is very challenging for the autonomous UAVs to do inventory task motions safely because aisles are narrow and long, and the illumination is poor. Prior autonomous UAVs are not suitable for such environments, since they suffer from either localization methods prone to disturbance, drift and outliers, or expensive sensors. We present a low-cost sensing system with an extended Kalman filter (EKF)-based multi-sensor fusion framework to achieve practical autonomous navigation of UAVs in warehouse environments. To overcome the inherent drift, outliers, and disturbance problems of naïve UAV localization methods, we suggest 1) exploiting component test of Mahalanobis norm to reject outliers efficiently, 2) introducing pseudo-covariance to incorporate a visual SLAM algorithm, and 3) recognizing floor lanes to get absolute information–as robust data fusion methods. Exemplar results are provided to demonstrate the effectiveness of the methods. The proposed system has been successfully implemented for diverse cyclic inventory inspection tasks in a materials warehouse.	https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8908692	0
Parallel Reinforcement Learning With Minimal Communication Overhead for IoT Environments	Many Internet of Things (IoT) applications require a distributed architecture for decision making either because of a lack of a centralized system, failure-prone connectivity to a centralized system or because the imposed latency to contact such a system is too high for real-time applications. Often, these IoT applications fall in the domain of reinforcement learning (RL), e.g., autonomous robot navigation in smart factories and traffic signal control in smart cities. However, RL-based applications require a long learning time. To overcome this limitation and scale with the number of agents, parallel RL (PRL) algorithms run multiple RL agents in parallel and on distributed environments. However, deploying PRL algorithms in such environments entails a communication overhead that increases the (actual) execution time. The state-of-the-art PRL algorithms are designed for reducing the learning time while assuming no (or limited) communication overhead. In this article, we present a novel partitioning algorithm that minimizes the communication overhead in PRL running on IoT environments. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work that focuses on solving the communication overhead of distributing PRL algorithms without requiring any a priori knowledge about the structure of the problem. The proposed algorithm intelligently combines a dynamic state partitioning strategy, which exploits the agent's exploration capabilities to build partition knowledge while learning, with an efficient mapping of agents to partitions, which reduces the communication among agents. Performance evaluations show that the proposed algorithm can achieve almost no communication among PRL agents at the converged state.	https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8911213	0
State-Aware Rate Adaptation for UAVs by Incorporating On-Board Sensors	Nowadays unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) are being widely applied to a wealth of civil and military applications. Robust and high-throughput wireless communication is the crux of these UAV applications. Yet, air-to-ground links suffer from time-varying channels induced by the agile mobility and dynamic environments. Rate adaptation algorithms are generally used to choose the optimal data rate based on the current channel conditions. State-of-the-art approaches leverage physical layer information for rate adaptation, and they work well under certain conditions. However, the above protocols still have limitation under constantly changing flight states and environments for air-to-ground links. To solve this problem, we propose StateRate, a state-optimized rate adaptation algorithm that fully exploits the characteristics of UAV systems using a hybrid deep learning model. The key observation is that the rate adaptation strategy needs to be adjusted according to motion-dependent channel models, which can be reflected by flight states. In this work, the rate adaptation protocol is enhanced with the help of the on-board sensors in UAVs. To make full use of the sensor data, we introduce a learning-based prediction module by leveraging the internal state and an online learning algorithm by employing the pre-trained model that adapts the rate adaptation algorithm to different environments. We implement our algorithm on a commercial UAV platform and evaluate it in various environments. The results demonstrate that our system outperforms the best-known rate adaptation algorithm up to 53% in terms of throughput when the velocity is 2-6 m/s.	https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8886362	0
An Artificially Weighted Spanning Tree Coverage Algorithm for Decentralized Flying Robots	In this article, an artificially weighted spanning tree coverage (AWSTC) algorithm is proposed for the distributed path planning of multiple flying robots. To balance well the efficiency, redundancy, and robustness in the cooperative coverage problem, each robot simultaneously constructs its spanning tree, which grows toward the center of inertia of the uncovered area and keeps away from the trees of its partners. Based on this, each robot covers a concerned area with almost equal trajectory length and computational burden. To guarantee dynamical consistency, a trajectory-smoothing method is developed utilizing Bézier curve transition. As transition in the spanning tree path planning is always conducted around the corner with right angle, geometric and velocity profiles of this kind of transition can be preevaluated as a basic component and then connected to establish more complex real-time trajectories according to the constructed spanning trees. Numerical evaluations and real-time flight experiments are carried out at last. Results demonstrate that the proposed strategy can generate a smooth trajectory for an area coverage problem while ensuring efficiency and robustness. In particular, the efficiency of the proposed algorithm is quite close to the typical centralized spanning tree coverage (STC) algorithm, while ensuring the fulfillment of the coverage task regardless of any breakdown in the individual robot. Note to Practitioners—In applications such as infrastructure inspection and plant protection, the concerned area or terrain is required to be fully covered with the smallest possible time consumption. In view of these real-world requirements, multiple unmanned systems with proper path planning provide a promising solution that can significantly enhance the efficiency as well as the robustness, compared with a single-robot system. Especially, centralized STC algorithms, concerning the computation efficiency and trajectory redundancy of multiple unmanned systems, demonstrate satisfactory effectiveness, and thereby receive a lot of attention. Unfortunately, most of the STC algorithms are proposed in a centralized control framework. Therefore, it is worth to study its decentralized version that could exploit the advantages of the distributed multiple robots. With this consideration, a decentralized AWSTC algorithm is proposed in this article. This spanning tree-based strategy artificially assigns priority weight for each cell, with respect to each individual robot, in the concerned area. With specially designed weight assignment, each robot tends to construct a spanning tree with cells that are uncovered but keep away from the trees of its partners. Based on this, the task burden as well as computational cost of each robot are almost equal. To improve the real-time performance, a Bézier transition trajectory-generation method is also used. With proper parameter selection, robots can generate smooth trajectory with constant velocity in real-time missions. Numerical evaluations and experiments with real-time flight demonstrate the effectiveness of this methodology.	https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9017928	0
Ground Moving Vehicle Detection and Movement Tracking Based on the Neuromorphic Vision Sensor	Moving-objects detection is a critical ability for an autonomous vehicle. Facing the high detection requirements and the slow target-extraction problem of a common camera, this article proposes to utilize neuromorphic vision sensor (DVS) for detecting the moving objects and estimating their movement states. For a better detection work, the DVS image's noise points are filtered and the CTRV kinematics model is built in advance. In order to distinguish the overlapped or nearby bodies and get the accurate clustering number, this article proposes a 3-D improved K -means method. As the clustering centers can be influenced by the movement easily, the moving objects' clustering centers appear unstable, so the movement estimation also fluctuates. In order to obtain stable movement estimation, this article proposes a strong tracking center differential external Kalman filter (SCDEKF) to track the moving objects, and the method has higher accuracy and less computational load. In order to verify the advantages of proposed methods, a simulation environment was established in the Gazebo, and the common cameras were also added in simulation for comparison with the DVS sensor. The simulation results show that the 3-D improved K -means method with DVS can cluster the moving objects accurately, and the SCDEKF can provide more accurate movement estimation than the traditional EKF method. Finally, two experiments were conducted to prove the methods' superiority. The main contribution is to solve the exploitation problems faced by the short-term borne sensor and promote its application in transportation.	https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9112163	0
Android HIV: A Study of Repackaging Malware for Evading Machine-Learning Detection	Machine learning-based solutions have been successfully employed for the automatic detection of malware on Android. However, machine learning models lack robustness to adversarial examples, which are crafted by adding carefully chosen perturbations to the normal inputs. So far, the adversarial examples can only deceive detectors that rely on syntactic features (e.g., requested permissions, API calls, etc.), and the perturbations can only be implemented by simply modifying application’s manifest. While recent Android malware detectors rely more on semantic features from Dalvik bytecode rather than manifest, existing attacking/defending methods are no longer effective. In this paper, we introduce a new attacking method that generates adversarial examples of Android malware and evades being detected by the current models. To this end, we propose a method of applying optimal perturbations onto Android APK that can successfully deceive the machine learning detectors. We develop an automated tool to generate the adversarial examples without human intervention. In contrast to existing works, the adversarial examples crafted by our method can also deceive recent machine learning-based detectors that rely on semantic features such as control-flow-graph. The perturbations can also be implemented directly onto APK’s Dalvik bytecode rather than Android manifest to evade from recent detectors. We demonstrate our attack on two state-of-the-art Android malware detection schemes, MaMaDroid and Drebin. Our results show that the malware detection rates decreased from 96% to 0% in MaMaDroid, and from 97% to 0% in Drebin, with just a small number of codes to be inserted into the APK.	https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8782574	0
Performance of Joint Sensing-Communication Cooperative Sensing UAV Network	To exploit the spectrum reuse potential and enhance the cooperative sensing ability of the cooperative sensing unmanned aerial vehicle network (CSUN), we propose a novel joint sensing-communication (JSC) CSUN that can simultaneously conduct downward-looking radar sensing and sensing data fusion communication with the unified spectrum and transceiver by adopting the beam sharing scheme. To achieve the beam sharing scheme, we design a novel antenna array equipped on each UAV, which can generate a sensing beam and a communication beam orthogonally for downward detection and data-fusion communication, respectively. To quantify the cooperative sensing performance of CSUN, we propose and formulate a novel upper-bound average cooperative sensing area (UB-ACSA) as the cooperative sensing performance metric, based on deriving the closed-form expressions for the average mutual sensing interference of CSUN and the communication capacity constraints. Finally, extensive simulations are conducted to validate the theoretical results. We also demonstrate that the cooperative sensing performance of the JSC CSUN can improve by 66.3 percent compared with the conventional CSUN in terms of UB-ACSA.	https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9282206	0
Robust Fault-Tolerant Control for Underactuated Takeoff and Landing UAVs	This article surveys the trajectory tracking issue of underactuated vertical takeoff and landing (VTOL) unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) subject to thrust and torque faults, i.e., loss of efficiency and actuator biases. In particular, a robust control algorithm against time-varying faults and disturbances is proposed. To exploit the underactuated nature of the VTOL UAV system, the control algorithm is developed based on a hierarchical framework, under which the position and attitude loops are studied in sequence. Specifically, by implementing a novel robust fault-tolerant control strategy, a force command is first synthesized for the position tracking to the desired trajectory, and then, a desired torque using an innovative sliding manifold is designed such that the nonsingular attitude tracking to an attitude command is achieved. This attitude command, as well as the desired thrust, is extracted from the synthesized force command. In terms of hierarchical system stability theory, it is shown that the overall closed-loop error system is asymptotically stable. Finally, simulation results validate and highlight the tracking performance of the proposed control algorithm.	https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9037179	0
A Discriminative Distillation Network for Cross-Source Remote Sensing Image Retrieval	Nowadays, several remote sensing image capturing technologies are used ranging from unmanned aerial vehicles to satellites. Powerful learning-based discriminative features play an essential role in content-based remote sensing image retrieval (CBRSIR). Cross-source CBRSIR (CS-CBRSIR) is used to find relevant remote sensing images across different remote sensing sources (i.e., multispectral images and panchromatic images). But it is limited by large cross-source and intrasource variations caused by different semantic objects, spatial resolution, and spectral resolution. The main limitation of CS-CBRSIR is that it cannot address the inconsistency between different sources and exploit the intrinsic relation between them. This study proposes a discriminative distillation network for CS-CBRSIR to address this limitation. To enlarge the interclass variations and reduce the intraclass differences, the discriminative features from the first source are first extracted with a well-designed joint optimization configuration (JOC) on the basis of deep neural networks. Thereafter, the features extracted from the first source are used as a supervision signal for the second source; feature distribution in common feature space between the first and second sources are made significantly similar. The method proposed in this study simultaneously handles the cross-source and intersource variations, unlike the existing methods. Extensive experiments on the DSRSID dataset with Euclidean distance verify the effectiveness of our proposed method.	https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9044737	0
Optimal Dynamic Pricing for Trading-Off User Utility and Operator Profit in Smart Grid	A conventional power grid is criticized by its poor capability of power usage management, especially in handling dynamically varying power demands over time. The concept of smart grid has been introduced to mitigate this problem by satisfying not only real-time power demands, but also by restricting power usage within the capacity. Its consistent outperformance and new perspective in computer intelligence to control the grid for autonomous power consumption has been gradually replacing the conventional power grid. However, even in smart grid, providing high satisfaction to users often leads smart grid operator (SGO) to loss and vice versa. In this paper, we develop an optimal dynamic pricing mechanism for trading-off (ODPT), for SGOs that tradeoff between user utility and operator profit in smart grid systems. It allows the operator to purchase power from multiple energy producers and to set selling price to users dynamically following the demand-supply theory of economics. It also exploits an artificial neural network model to more accurately predict the power usage. The simulation results, carried out on a commercially available optimization modeling tool using practical power usage data, prove the effectiveness of the proposed ODPT in increasing the operator profit while satisfying user demands.	https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8113531	0
IoT-Based Electric Vehicle State Estimation and Control Algorithms Under Cyber Attacks	In order to provide intelligent services, the Internet-of-Things (IoT) facilitates millions of smart devices to be enabled with network connectivity to sense, collect, process, and exchange information. Based on the communication infrastructure, the IoT can allow cyber-physical devices, such as an electric vehicle, to sense, monitor, and control from the remote control center in real time. Unfortunately, the traditional communication infrastructure is vulnerable to cyber attacks, so it is a challenging task for the IoT to explore these applications. In order to overcome the problem, this article proposes an algorithm for monitoring and controlling the electric vehicle using the IoT communication network considering false data-injection attacks. First, the driverless electric vehicle with onboard vision system is represented by a state-space framework. As the electric vehicle and monitoring control center are far away, the IoT-embedded smart sensors and actuators are used to measure and control the system states. The vehicle sensing information is transmitted to the control center over an unreliable communication channel where attacks happen. Based on the mean square error principle, the optimal state estimation algorithm is derived to know and visualize the vehicle states. In order to regulate the vehicle states, the optimal control algorithm is designed based on the semidefinite programming approach. The simulation results show that the proposed algorithms are able to properly estimate and regulate the vehicle states within a short period of time.	https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8862884	0
A Game Theoretic Scheme for Collaborative Vehicular Task Offloading in 5G HetNets	The 5G heterogeneous networks (HetNets) are capable of providing real-time computing services for autonomous vehicles (AVs) by deploying edge computing devices (ECDs) at macro cell base stations (MCBSs) and small cell base stations (SCBSs). With the imbalanced distribution and fast moving AVs contending intensely for computing services, how to efficiently exploit cooperations among participants in 5G HetNets to improve the service performance is therefore challenging. In this paper, we develop a game theoretic scheme for collaborative vehicular task offloading to facilitate the computing services in 5G HetNets. Specifically, we propose a two-stage vehicular task offloading mechanism to promote the cooperation among participants with the target of improving the task completion rate and the utilities of the participants, where the mechanism jointly considers the network architecture of the HetNets, the imbalanced distribution of AVs and the reuse of task results. In the first stage, an auction model is designed to help the MCBS select the optimal SCBS to execute the offloaded task based on the requirement of the task and the available computing resources of SCBSs. According to the task execution cost declared by the selected SCBS, the MCBS then bargains with the AV for the agreement of the task offloading service to maximize their utilities in the second stage. Using simulations, we show that the proposed collaborative task offloading scheme can achieve a higher task completion rate for the task offloading service and bring higher utilities to all participants than conventional schemes.	https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9275320	0
Beyond Vision: Hidden Car Detector With On-Demand Relaying in Vehicular Communications	Cellular Vehicle-to-Vehicle (C-V2V) communications take autonomous driving technology to the next level by allowing a Vehicular User Equipment (V-UE) to receive Cooperative Awareness Messages (CAMs) from other V-UEs, and enable the V-UE to see beyond what is detectable by vision-based sensors, thereby preventing accidents and ensuring user safety. However, there remains a fundamental limitation in the conventional CAM broadcasting since a transmitter (TX) V-UE cannot confirm whether its CAM is successfully received at other V-UEs. Without a feedback process, a significant uncertainty arises in CAM reception, posing a critical threat to user safety. To address this threat, we propose Beyond-Vision, an effective C-V2V on-demand relay system that allows CAMs that are not well received at nearby V-UEs to be better received. Through simulation that reflects realistic vehicle mobility and road environments in urban scenarios, we verify the superiority of Beyond-Vision over the conventional C-V2V, which improves performance by up to 215% in terms of message reception ratio (MRR) within a communication range under Non-Line-Of-Sight (NLOS) channels.	https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9252165	0
DDM: Fast Near-Optimal Multi-Robot Path Planning Using Diversified-Path and Optimal Sub-Problem Solution Database Heuristics	We propose a novel centralized and decoupled algorithm, DDM, for solving multi-robot path planning problems in grid graphs, targeting on-demand and automated warehouse-like settings. Two settings are studied: a traditional one whose objective is to move a set of robots from their respective initial vertices to the goal vertices as quickly as possible, and a dynamic one which requires frequent re-planning to accommodate for goal configuration adjustments. Among other techniques, DDM is mainly enabled through exploiting two innovative heuristics: path diversification and optimal sub-problem solution databases. The two heuristics attack two distinct phases of a decoupling-based planner: while path diversification allows the more effective use of the entire workspace for robot travel, optimal sub-problem solution databases facilitate the fast resolution of local path conflicts. Extensive evaluation demonstrates that DDM achieves high levels of scalability and solution quality close to the optimum.	https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8962218	0
CANeleon: Protecting CAN Bus With Frame ID Chameleon	The Controller Area Network (CAN) has been widely used in the automotive and industrial automation for over two decades. However, due to the lack of security mechanisms, CAN is vulnerable to attacks. In this paper, we propose a novel protection scheme called CANeleon. It can defend CAN against a smart attacker who might inject malicious frames with legitimate frame IDs, which cannot be mitigated by existing countermeasures. Inspired by the idea of moving target defense technologies, CANeleon equips each legitimate CAN node with the ability to shift the spoofed frame ID. In this way, the IDs of malicious frames are exposed and can be further filtered by legitimate nodes. Moreover, CANeleon neither inserts new information to the frame, nor requires any modification to the CAN protocol, so it is in compliance with the existing standards. CANeleon is a decentralized mechanism guaranteeing that the protection could be done simultaneously without additional communication. Experiments on a CAN bus prototype and a real self-driving vehicle prove the effectiveness of CANeleon.	https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9079183	0
Moving Horizon Estimation of Air Data Parameters for UAVs	Local wind velocities, angle of attack, and lift coefficients of a fixed-wing unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) are estimated by fusing kinematic, aerodynamic, and stochastic wind models with data from an inertial measurement unit, a global navigation satellite system receiver, and a pitot-static tube in a moving horizon estimator. Experimental validation with two different UAVs and two sensor sets of different quality shows promising results for both wind velocity and angle of attack estimation.	https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8863994	0
Secrecy Performance of Terrestrial Radio Links Under Collaborative Aerial Eavesdropping	Motivated to understand the increasingly severe threat of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) to the confidentiality of terrestrial radio links, this paper analyzes the ergodic and E-outage secrecy capacities of the links in the presence of multiple cooperative aerial eavesdroppers flying autonomously in three-dimensional (3D) spaces and exploiting selection combining (SC) or maximal ratio combining (MRC). The “cut-off” density of the eavesdroppers under which the secrecy capacities vanish is identified. By decoupling the analysis of the random trajectories from the random channel fading, closed-form approximations with almost sure convergence to the secrecy capacities are devised. The analysis is extended to study the impact of the oscillator phase noises and finite memories of the aerial eavesdroppers on the secrecy performance of the ground link. Validated by simulations, the cut-off density only depends on the range of the link in the case of SC eavesdropping, while it depends on the flight region of the eavesdroppers in the case of MRC eavesdropping.	https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8735776	0
Camera-Robot Calibration for the Da Vinci Robotic Surgery System	The development of autonomous or semiautonomous surgical robots stands to improve the performance of existing teleoperated equipment but requires fine hand-eye calibration between the free-moving endoscopic camera and patient-side manipulator arms (PSMs). A novel method of solving this problem for the da Vinci robotic surgical system and kinematically similar systems is presented. First, a series of image-processing and optical-tracking operations are performed to compute the coordinate transformation between the endoscopic camera view frame and an optical-tracking marker permanently affixed to the camera body. Then, the kinematic properties of the PSM are exploited to compute the coordinate transformation between the kinematic base frame of the PSM and an optical marker permanently affixed thereto. Using these transformations, it is then possible to compute the spatial relationship between the PSM and the endoscopic camera using only one tracker snapshot of the two markers. The effectiveness of this calibration is demonstrated by successfully guiding the PSM end-effector to points of interest identified through the camera. Additional tests on a surgical task, namely, grasping a surgical needle, are also performed to validate the proposed method. The resulting visually guided robot positioning accuracy is better than the earlier hand-eye calibration results reported in the literature for the da Vinci system while supporting the intraoperative update of the calibration and requiring only devices that are already commonly used in the surgical environment.	https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9084276	0
Learning-Based Real-Time Process-Aware Anomaly Monitoring for Assured Autonomy	Various learning-based approaches have been proposed recently for robot control in complex unknown environments. However, ensuring safety in these systems is essential. Learning-based approaches are usually black-box systems which are difficult to interpret/verify. We propose a real-time continuous safety checking system which monitors the validity of the mapping from the sensor input to the actuator command (i.e., controller-focused anomaly detection) and from the actuator command to the sensor input (i.e., system-focused anomaly detection). Our controller-focused anomaly monitor is an image conditioned energy based generative adversarial network in which the discriminator acts as an energy function attributing low energies to proper actuator commands and high energy to anomalous actuator commands. Our system-focused anomaly monitor is based on an action condition video prediction framework, which finds the action conditioned future frame most similar to the actual future frame and compares it with the true action to detect anomaly. We experimentally demonstrate the effectiveness of our framework for an autonomous navigation system in indoor (on datasets from our ground vehicle) and outdoor environments (on Udacity dataset). Furthermore, we show through experimental evaluations that our proposed framework is resilient to various data corruptions common in a vision based system.	https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9099389	0
Dynamic Optical Localization of a Mobile Robot Using Kalman Filtering-Based Position Prediction	Autonomous mobile robots operating in areas with poor GPS and wireless coverage (e.g., underwater) must rely on alternative localization and communication approaches. In this article, we present an light-emitting diode (LED) based system that achieves simultaneous localization and communication (SLAC), where the line-of-sight (LOS) requirement for communication is exploited to extract the relative bearing of the communicating parties for localization. By using Kalman filtering to obtain the mobile robot's predicted position, the system is able to reduce the overhead of establishing the LOS and, therefore, significantly improve on the quality of the localization. The proposed design of the optical localization system is presented and its effectiveness is demonstrated with extensive simulation and experimentation in a two-dimensional setting, consisting of a mobile robot and two stationary base nodes.	https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9035400	0
Path Planning Under Malicious Injections and Removals of Perceived Obstacles: A Probabilistic Programming Approach	An autonomous mobile robot may encounter adversarial environments in which an attacker tries to influence its decisions. Through physical or software-level attacks, some of the robot's sensors might be compromised-a special concern for self-driving vehicles. Motivated by this scenario, this letter introduces and studies the problem of planning kinematically feasible (and possibly efficient) paths with bounded collision probability in adversarial settings where the obstacles perceived online by the robot display two layers of uncertainty. The first is the “usual” Gaussian uncertainty one would obtain from a standard object tracker (e.g., an Extended Kalman Filter); the second is an additional layer of uncertainty that captures possible sensor attacks and describes the actual existence of groups of obstacles in the environment. We study the complexity of the problem and propose a general sampling-based solution framework that uses the Sequential Probability Ratio Test (SPRT) to check collision probability constraints along the computed trajectory. We also show how probabilistic programming languages (PPLs) can simplify programming common algorithms (such as RRT and Hybrid A*) for mixed uncertainty. In addition to providing an easy-to-use programming framework, our approach is shown to plan safer paths compared to a Naive Monte Carlo baseline when both approaches are allowed to use at most the same given number of samples to perform collision checks.	https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9184965	0
A Direct Position Determination Approach for Underwater Acoustic Sensor Networks	In this paper, we consider the source localization problem with an underwater acoustic sensor network (UASN) consisting of a number of platforms each equipped with an array, such as an autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV). Direct position determination (DPD) has been a promising topic in recent years. Existing DPD methods can be divided into two categories: global coherent processing and non-coherent processing. The former is easy to implement in practical tasks but the coherence between the received signals at different nodes are not exploited, while the requirements for coherent processing may not be fulfilled in real environments. A multi-cluster array model is constructed considering the deployment of the nodes with the intention to exploit the available coherence in the UASN and avoiding the side effects of imperfect spatial coherence. A weighted MUSIC direct source localization approach is proposed based on this model. The arrays within a cluster work coherently as a large array and contribute a MUSIC spectrum. The final source position estimate is obtained from a weighted combination of these spectra, and the weights are dependent on the eigenstucture and noise variance of each cluster. We first investigate the theoretical gain of inter-array coherence exploitation on localization accuracy by means of Cramér-Rao bound analysis. Then the model for imperfect spatial coherence is generalized to the multi-cluster system to examine the performance of the proposed approach when the inherent constraints for intra-cluster coherent processing can not be guaranteed. Numerical results demonstrate the superior resolution capability of the proposed approach and its robustness to imperfect spatial coherence.	https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9173826	0
Combining Domain Adaptation and Spatial Consistency for Unseen Fruits Counting: A Quasi-Unsupervised Approach	Autonomous robotic platforms can be effectively used to perform automatic fruits yield estimation. To this aim, robots need data-driven models that process image streams and count, even approximately, the number of fruits in an orchard. However, training such models following a supervised paradigm is expensive and unpractical. Extending pre-trained models to perform yield estimation for a completely new type of fruit is even more challenging, but interesting since this situation is typical in practice. In this work, we combine a State-of-the-Art weakly-supervised fruit counting model with an unsupervised style transfer method for addressing the task above. In this sense, our proposed approach is quasi-unsupervised. In particular, we use a Cycle-Generative Adversarial Network (C-GAN) to perform unsupervised domain adaptation and train it alongside with a Presence-Absence Classifier (PAC) that discriminates images containing fruits or not. The PAC produces the weak-supervision signal for the counting network, that can then be used on the target orchard directly. Experiments on datasets collected in four different orchards show that the proposed approach is more accurate than the supervised baseline methods.	https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8957569	0
Cloud Computing-Based Analyses to Predict Vehicle Driving Shockwave for Active Safe Driving in Intelligent Transportation System	In the cloud computing era, the analyses of various types of big data gathered from the Internet of Vehicles, the Internet of Things, and smart sensors/devices achieve convenient services. Some famous applications include vehicle traffic loading on roads (from Google MAP), video sharing for fans group (from Facebook or Youtube), and so on. However, to achieve real-time active safe driving (RT-ASD) under unstable driving in high-threat areas on roads becomes an open issue in cloud computing-based intelligent transportation system. This paper proposes a predictive backward shockwave analysis approach (PSA) to achieve the RT-ASD based on the analyses of macroscopic traffic shockwave (PSA_MA) and microscopic car-following (PSA_mi). The PSA contributes in several aspects to active safe driving: 1) predicting and analyzing high threat of backward shockwaves from the gathered big data of the driving state information vehicles; 2) informing the analyzed threat messages to the vehicles in high-threat areas via the 3-Tier hierarchical cloud computing mechanism; 3) reducing the driving threat certainly; and 4) PSA_MA and PSA_mi can be applied for achieving active safe driving in autonomous self-driving vehicles and human-driving vehicles. The numerical results show that the PSA outperforms in approaches to relative error rate prediction, the accuracy of the backward shockwave determination, average vehicle velocity, average travel time, number of goodput vehicles, time-to-collision, and distance-to-collision.	https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8671516	0
Multiview Scene Image Inpainting Based on Conditional Generative Adversarial Networks	With the help of a multiview system, an unmanned vehicle system can better understand the surrounding environment and choose a more accurate and safer path to avoid obstacles. However, due to the interference of the signal or the loss of part of the signal during the acquisition, processing, compression, transmission and decompression of the video image signal, the local area of the image is abnormal, which affects the perception and decision of the system. This article addresses the problems of inaccurate restored images and noise in the restored images by proposing an image restoration method that is applied to a multicamera system. We utilize different perspective images captured by different cameras to assist and constrain the restoration of the damaged image. This method restores the image by combining sample representations and sample distribution models which respectively based on self-encoder reconstruction loss learning and generative adversarial networks. In this method, the infrastructure is a conditional generative adversarial network, the condition is the images that are from the other perspectives, and the generator is a self-encoder structure with cross-layer connection, group convolution and feature map channel exchanged. This method was carried out on a dataset recorded in Zurich using a pair of cameras mounted on a mobile platform. The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method is superior to the existing methods in terms of mean L1 Loss, mean L2 Loss and the peak signal to noise ratio (PSNR).	https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8911481	0
Don’t Forget The Past: Recurrent Depth Estimation from Monocular Video	Autonomous cars need continuously updated depth information. Thus far, depth is mostly estimated independently for a single frame at a time, even if the method starts from video input. Our method produces a time series of depth maps, which makes it an ideal candidate for online learning approaches. In particular, we put three different types of depth estimation (supervised depth prediction, self-supervised depth prediction, and self-supervised depth completion) into a common framework. We integrate the corresponding networks with a ConvLSTM such that the spatiotemporal structures of depth across frames can be exploited to yield a more accurate depth estimation. Our method is flexible. It can be applied to monocular videos only or be combined with different types of sparse depth patterns. We carefully study the architecture of the recurrent network and its training strategy. We are first to successfully exploit recurrent networks for real-time self-supervised monocular depth estimation and completion. Extensive experiments show that our recurrent method outperforms its image-based counterpart consistently and significantly in both self-supervised scenarios. It also outperforms previous depth estimation methods of the three popular groups. Please refer to our webpage1 for details.	https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9170769	0
Dynamic Attitude Planning for Trajectory Tracking in Thrust-Vectoring UAVs	This paper addresses the trajectory tracking control problem for underactuated unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), with specific focus on vehicles with thrust-vectoring capabilities. According to the different actuation mechanisms, the most common UAV platforms can achieve only a partial decoupling of attitude and position tasks. Since position tracking is of utmost importance for applications involving aerial vehicles, we propose a control scheme in which position tracking is the primary objective. To this end, this paper exploits the concept of attitude planner, a dynamical system through which the desired attitude reference is processed to guarantee the satisfaction of the primary objective: The attitude tracking task is considered as a secondary objective, which can be realized as long as the desired trajectory satisfies specific trackability conditions.	https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8723556	0
Behavioral Biometrics for Continuous Authentication in the Internet-of-Things Era: An Artificial Intelligence Perspective	In the Internet-of-Things (IoT) era, user authentication is essential to ensure the security of connected devices and the customization of passive services. However, conventional knowledge-based and physiological biometric-based authentication systems (e.g., password, face recognition, and fingerprints) are susceptible to shoulder surfing attacks, smudge attacks, and heat attacks. The powerful sensing capabilities of IoT devices, including smartphones, wearables, robots, and autonomous vehicles enable continuous authentication (CA) based on behavioral biometrics. The artificial intelligence (AI) approaches hold significant promise in sifting through large volumes of heterogeneous biometrics data to offer unprecedented user authentication and user identification capabilities. In this survey article, we outline the nature of CA in IoT applications, highlight the key behavioral signals, and summarize the extant solutions from an AI perspective. Based on our systematic and comprehensive analysis, we discuss the challenges and promising future directions to guide the next generation of AI-based CA research.	https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9121981	0
Joint Fleet Sizing and Charging System Planning for Autonomous Electric Vehicles	This paper studies the joint fleet sizing and charging system planning problem for a company operating a fleet of autonomous electric vehicles (AEVs) for passenger and goods transportation. Most of the relevant published papers focus on intracity scenarios and adopt heuristic approaches, e.g., agent based simulation, which do not guarantee optimality. In contrast, we propose a mixed integer linear programming model for intercity scenarios. This model incorporates comprehensive considerations of 1) limited AEV driving range; 2) optimal AEV routing and relocating operations; 3) time-varying origin-destination transport demands; and 4) differentiated operation cost structure of passenger and goods transportation. The proposed model can be computational expensive when the scale of the transportation network is large. We then exploit the structure of this program to expedite its solution. Numerical experiments are conducted to validate the proposed method. Our experimental results show that AEVs in passenger and goods transportation have remarkable planning and operation differences. We also demonstrate that intelligent routing and relocating operations, charging system and vehicle parameters, e.g., charging power, battery capacity, driving speed etc., can significantly affect the economic efficiency and the planning results of an AEV fleet.	https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8880643	0
A Trust-Based Team Formation Framework for Mobile Intelligence in Smart Factories	In Smart Factories, automated guided vehicles (AGVs) accomplish heterogeneous tasks as moving objects, restoring connectivity, or performing different manufacturing activities into production lines. These kinds of devices combine several capabilities, as artificial intelligence (visual and speech recognition, automatic fault detecting, proactive behavior) and mobility, into the so-called “mobile intelligence.” A typical scenario is represented by a workshop with a large number of mobile intelligent devices with associated agents, mutually interacting on their behalf. Here, to reach a given target by contemporary satisfying some basic requirements like effectiveness and efficiency, it is often necessary to organize ad hoc teams of free-moving vehicles, sensors, and smart devices. Therefore, a specific issue is the adequate representation of the reciprocal agent/device trustworthiness for advantaging such team formation processes within a smart factory environment. To this end, in this article, first, we define a trust measure based on reliability and reputation of AGVs, which are computed based on the feedbacks released for the AGVs activities in the factory; second, we design a trust framework exploiting the defined measures to support the formation of virtual, temporary, and trust-based teams of mobile intelligent devices; and third, we present a set of experimental results highlighting that the proposed trust framework can improve the workshop performance in terms of effectiveness and efficiency.	https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8950429	0
Rigid-Soft Interactive Learning for Robust Grasping	Robot learning is widely accepted by academia and industry with its potentials to transform autonomous robot control through machine learning. Inspired by widely used soft fingers on grasping, we propose a method of rigid-soft interactive learning, aiming at reducing the time of data collection. In this letter, we classify the interaction categories into Rigid-Rigid, Rigid-Soft, SoftRigid according to the interaction surface between grippers and target objects. We find experimental evidence that the interaction types between grippers and target objects play an essential role in the learning methods. We use soft, stuffed toys for training, instead of everyday objects, to reduce the integration complexity and computational burden. Although the stuffed toys are limited in reflecting the physics of finger-object interaction in real-life scenarios, we exploit such rigid-soft interaction by changing the gripper fingers to the soft ones when dealing with rigid, daily-life items such as the Yale-CMU-Berkeley (YCB) objects. With a small data collection of 5 K picking attempts in total, our results suggest that such Rigid-Soft and Soft-Rigid interactions are transferable. Moreover, the combination of such interactions shows better performance on the grasping test. We also explore the effect of the grasp type on the learning method by changing the gripper configurations. We achieve the best grasping performance at 97.5% for easy YCB objects and 81.3% for difficult YCB objects while using a precise grasp with a two-soft-finger gripper to collect training data and power grasp with a four-soft-finger gripper to test the grasp policy.	https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8972574	0
On Wireless Blind Spots in the C-V2X Sidelink	The third generation partnership project (3GPP) has issued specifications for the autonomous assignment of radio resources by vehicles on the sidelink of the cellular-vehicle-to-everything (C-V2X) technology. It is based on a sensing mechanism for resource selection and a semi-persistent scheduling for resource reservation to periodic safety messages. Imperfect sensing due to hidden terminals and to half-duplex on board transceivers may result in the selection of interfered resources for successive message transmissions. As a consequence of the lost packets, involved vehicles may become blind to the presence of other vehicles in their vicinity even for many seconds, with threats to the road safety. In this paper, we define these events as wireless blind spots (WBSs) and characterize their probability to occur. We propose an enhancement to the autonomous mode in order to reduce the WBS duration and demonstrate the benefits of the proposal against the legacy mode, both analytically in a simplified scenario and through simulations in a highway environment.	https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9112708	0
Multimodal Multispectral Imaging System for Small UAVs	Multispectral imaging is an attractive sensing modality for small unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) in numerous applications. The most compact spectral camera architecture is based on spectral filters in the focal plane. Vehicle movement can be used to scan the scene using multiple bandpass filters arranged perpendicular to the flight direction. With known camera trajectory and scene structure, it is possible to assemble a spectral image in software. In this letter, we demonstrate the feasibility of a novel concept for low-cost wide area multispectral imaging with integrated spectral consistency testing. Six bandpass filters are arranged in a periodically repeating pattern. Since different bands are recorded at different times and in different viewing directions, there is a risk of obtaining spectral artifacts in the image. We exploit the repeated sampling of bands to enable spectral consistency testing, which leads to significantly improved spectral integrity. In addition, an unfiltered region permits conventional 2D video imaging that can be used for image-based navigation and 3D reconstruction. The proposed multimodal imaging system was tested on a UAV in a realistic experiment. The results demonstrate that spectral reconstruction and consistency testing can be performed by image processing alone, based on visual simultaneous localization and mapping (VSLAM).	https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8962177	0
A Machine Learning Approach for Estimating Air Data Parameters of Small Fixed-Wing UAVs Using Distributed Pressure Sensors	This paper presents a method for estimating the air data parameters for a small fixed-wing, unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) using an arrangement of low-cost Micro-electromechinal systems (MEMS)-based pressure sensors embedded in the surface of the UAV. The pressure measurements are used in a machine learning (ML) model to estimate the angle of attack, sideslip angle, and airspeed. Two ML algorithms based on artificial neural networks (NNs) and linear regression (LR) are implemented, tested, and assessed using data collected from wind tunnel experiments and a flight test, and the results are compared to a benchmark flight test. Training the ML algorithms using wind tunnel data was found to introduce several potential error sources that need to be addressed in order to provide accurate estimation on the benchmark flight test, whereas training the algorithms using flight data provides lower estimation RMSE values. The performance of the NN structures has been found to slightly outperform the LR algorithms in estimation accuracy. Finally, results from using different sensor configurations and a pseudo-Reynolds number are presented in an effort to evaluate the influence of sensor number and placement on the accuracy of the method.	https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8859289	0
Adversarial Examples: Opportunities and Challenges	Deep neural networks (DNNs) have shown huge superiority over humans in image recognition, speech processing, autonomous vehicles, and medical diagnosis. However, recent studies indicate that DNNs are vulnerable to adversarial examples (AEs), which are designed by attackers to fool deep learning models. Different from real examples, AEs can mislead the model to predict incorrect outputs while hardly be distinguished by human eyes, therefore threaten security-critical deep-learning applications. In recent years, the generation and defense of AEs have become a research hotspot in the field of artificial intelligence (AI) security. This article reviews the latest research progress of AEs. First, we introduce the concept, cause, characteristics, and evaluation metrics of AEs, then give a survey on the state-of-the-art AE generation methods with the discussion of advantages and disadvantages. After that, we review the existing defenses and discuss their limitations. Finally, future research opportunities and challenges on AEs are prospected.	https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8842604	0
Fog-Based Multi-Class Dispatching and Charging for Autonomous Electric Mobility On-Demand	Despite the significant advances in vehicle automation and electrification, the next-decade aspirations for massive deployments of autonomous electric mobility on demand (AEMoD) services in big cities are still threatened by two major bottlenecks, namely, the communication/computation and charging delays. In order to target the communication/computation delays, the paper suggests the exploitation of fog-based architectures for localized AEMoD system operations. These emerging architectures are soon to become widely used, allowing for all localized operational decisions to be made with very low latency by fog controllers located close to the end applications (e.g., each city zone for AEMoD systems). As for the charging delays, an optimized multi-class charging and dispatching queuing model, with partial charging option for AEMoD vehicles is developed for each of these zones. The stability conditions of this model and the optimal number of classes are then derived. The decisions on the proportions of each class vehicles to partially/fully charge or directly serve customers are optimized to minimize the maximum and average system response times using convex optimization and Lagrangian analysis. The results show the merits of our proposed model and optimized decision scheme compared to both the always-charge and the equal-split scheme. Furthermore, the comparison of the maximum and average response time minimization results shows a very low variance in performance, which suggests by using the linear programming solution for lower complexity.	https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8654206	0
Gaussian Process Online Learning With a Sparse Data Stream	Gaussian processes (GPs) have been exploited for various applications even including online learning. To learn time-varying hyperparameters from an information-limited sparse data stream, we consider the infinite-horizon Gaussian process (IHGP) with a low computational complexity. For example, the IHGP framework could provide efficient GP online learning with a sparse data stream in mobile devices. However, we show that the originally proposed IHGP has difficulty in learning time-varying hyperparameters online from the sparse data stream due to the numerically approximated gradient of the marginal likelihood function. In this paper, we show how to extend the IHGP in order to learn time-varying hyperparameters using a sparse and non-stationary data stream. In particular, our solution approach offers the exact gradient as the solution of a Lyapunov equation. Therefore, our approach achieves better performance with a sparse data stream while still keeping the computational complexity low. Finally, we present the comparison results to demonstrate that our approach outperforms the originally proposed IHGP on practical applications with sparse data streams. To demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach, we consider a multi-rate sensor fusion or an interpolation problem where slow vision systems need to be combined with other fast sensory units for feedback control in the field of autonomous driving. In particular, we apply our approach to vehicle lateral position error estimation together with a deep learning model for autonomous driving using non-stationary lateral position error signals in a model-free and data-driven fashion.	https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9145692	0
Implementing Distributed TDMA Using Relative Distance in Vehicular Networks	With the advent of self-driving cars, vehicular networking is gaining greater attention and the subject of extensive research. It is important to implement a more efficient and secure transportation system by enabling communication among objects on the road. Specifically, safety applications should be delivered in a reliable manner within a limited time period. Several time division multiple access (TDMA) protocols have been proposed to realize this. However, most of the existing research have proposed slot management approaches by taking into account the static topology; they have not sufficiently discussed research on “merging collision” arising from overlapping two or more collision domains due to vehicle mobility. In this study, we examine the effect of merging collision in terms of packet delivery ratio, overhead, and inter-basic safety message (inter-BSM) delay.11Delay between BSMs received in succession. To mitigate the effect of merging collision, we also propose a lightweight distributed TDMA protocol, where the order of vehicles on the road and their relative distances are exploited to determine the dedicated slot. The collision is further resolved using in-band signaling from the surrounding vehicles. Simulation studies show that the proposed scheme improves the performance of the packet delivery ratio (PDR) 10% more than the comparative protocol, and consequently achieves 97% and 95% PDRs, in highway and urban environment, respectively. Furthermore, the overhead and inter-BSM delay are substantially reduced.	https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9076271	0
Cyber Vulnerability Intelligence for Internet of Things Binary	Internet of Things (IoT) integrates a variety of software (e.g., autonomous vehicles and military systems) in order to enable the advanced and intelligent services. These software increase the potential of cyber-attacks because an adversary can launch an attack using system vulnerabilities. Existing software vulnerability analysis methods used to be relying on human experts crafted features, which usually miss many vulnerabilities. It is important to develop an automatic vulnerability analysis system to improve the countermeasures. However, source code is not always available (e.g., most IoT related industry software are closed source). Therefore, vulnerability detection on binary code is a demanding task. This article addresses the automatic binary-level software vulnerability detection problem by proposing a deep learning-based approach. The proposed approach consists of two phases: binary function extraction, and model building. First, we extract binary functions from the cleaned binary instructions obtained by using IDA Pro. Then, we employ the attention mechanism on top of a bidirectional long short-term memory for building the predictive model. To show the effectiveness of the proposed approach, we have collected datasets from several different sources. We have compared our proposed approach with a series of baselines including source code-based techniques and binary code-based techniques. We have also applied the proposed approach to real-world IoT related software such as VLC media player and LibTIFF project that used on Autonomous Vehicles. Experimental results show that our proposed approach betters the baselines and is able to detect more vulnerabilities.	https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8892533	0
The Mag-Gripper: A Soft-Rigid Gripper Augmented With an Electromagnet to Precisely Handle Clothes	This letter introduces Mag-Gripper, a novel robotic gripper specifically designed for autonomous clothing manipulation. It is capable of improving grasp repeatability, and precision, compensating uncertainties in the target grasping locations. We propose to approach the autonomous clothing manipulation challenge by involving a suitable magnetic force. For this reason, Mag-Gripper is equipped with an electromagnet capable of interacting with small metal parts properly placed on the garment to be grasped. Electromagnet exploitation is not a novelty in literature, but our design innovation consists in embedding the electromagnet in the structure of a jaw gripper. In so doing, we revisit a classic end-effector type, corresponding to the simplest representation of a hand capable of opposability, allowing easily controllable devices to perform grasps similar to the human pinch grasp. Mag-Gripper can find applications either in Research labs investigating Machine Learning-based clothing manipulation techniques either in companies having to manage a large amount of returns, either in home setting scenarios.	https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9165170	0
Pricing Data Tampering in Automated Fare Collection with NFC-Equipped Smartphones	Automated Fare Collection (AFC) systems have been globally deployed for decades, particularly in the public transportation network where the transit fee is calculated based on the length of the trip (a.k.a., distance-based pricing AFC systems). Although most messages of AFC systems are insecurely transferred in plaintext, system operators did not pay much attention to this vulnerability, since the AFC network is basically isolated from the public network (e.g., the Internet)-there is no way of exploiting such a vulnerability from the outside of the AFC network. Nevertheless, in recent years, the advent of Near Field Communication (NFC)-equipped smartphones has opened up a channel to invade into the AFC network from the mobile Internet, i.e., by Host-based Card Emulation (HCE) over NFC-equipped smartphones. In this paper, we identify a novel paradigm of attacks, called LessPay, against modern distance-based pricing AFC systems, enabling users to pay much less than what they are supposed to be charged. The identified attack has two important properties: 1) it is invisible to AFC system operators because the attack never causes any inconsistency in the back-end database of the operators; and 2) it can be scalable to affect a large number of users (e.g., 10,000) by only requiring a moderate-sized AFC card pool (e.g., containing 150 cards). To evaluate the efficacy of the attack, we developed an HCE app to launch the LessPay attack; and the real-world experiments demonstrate not only the feasibility of the LessPay attack (with 97.6 percent success rate) but also its low cost in terms of bandwidth and computation. Finally, we propose, implement and evaluate four types of countermeasures, and present security analysis and comparison of these countermeasures on defending against the LessPay attack.	https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8404117	0
A Robust Load Balancing and Routing Protocol for Intra-Car Hybrid Wired/Wireless Networks	With the emergence of connected and autonomous vehicles, sensors are increasingly deployed within cars to support new functionalities. Traffic generated by these sensors congest traditional intra-car networks, such as CAN buses. Furthermore, the large amount of wires needed to connect sensors makes it harder to design cars in a modular way. To alleviate these limitations, we propose, simulate, and implement a hybrid wired/wireless architecture, in which each node is connected to either a wired interface or a wireless interface or both. Specifically, we propose a new protocol, called Hybrid-Backpressure Collection Protocol (Hybrid-BCP), to efficiently collect data from sensors in intra-car networks. Hybrid-BCP is backward-compatible with the CAN bus technology, and builds on the BCP protocol, designed for wireless sensor networks. We theoretically prove that an idealized version of Hybrid-BCP achieves optimal throughput. Our testbed implementation, based on CAN and ZigBee transceivers, demonstrates the load balancing and routing functionalities of Hybrid-BCP and its resilience to DoS attacks and wireless jamming attacks. We further provide simulation results, obtained with the ns-3 simulator and based on real intra-car RSSI traces, that compare between the performance of Hybrid-BCP and a tree-based data collection protocol. Notably, the simulations show that Hybrid-BCP outperforms the tree-based protocol on throughput by 12 percent. The results also show that Hybrid-BCP maintains high packet delivery rate and low packet delay for safety-critical sensors that are directly connected to the sink through wire.	https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8353355	0
Active Localization of Gas Leaks Using Fluid Simulation	Sensors are routinely mounted on robots to acquire various forms of measurements in spatiotemporal fields. Locating features within these fields and reconstruction (mapping) of the dense fields can be challenging in resource-constrained situations, such as when trying to locate the source of a gas leak from a small number of measurements. In such cases, a model of the underlying complex dynamics can be exploited to discover informative paths within the field. We use a fluid simulator as a model to guide inference for the location of a gas leak. We perform localization via minimization of the discrepancy between observed measurements and gas concentrations predicted by the simulator. Our method is able to account for dynamically varying parameters of wind flow (e.g., direction and strength) and its effects on the observed distribution of gas. We develop algorithms for offline inference as well as for online path discovery via active sensing. We demonstrate the efficiency, accuracy, and versatility of our algorithm using experiments with a physical robot conducted in outdoor environments. We deploy an unmanned air vehicle mounted with a CO$_2$ sensor to automatically seek out a gas cylinder emitting CO$_2$ via a nozzle. We evaluate the accuracy of our algorithm by measuring the error in the inferred location of the nozzle, based on which we show that our proposed approach is competitive with respect to state-of-the-art baselines.	https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8629026	0
PHY-Layer Cover-Free Coding for Wireless Pilot Authentication in IoV Communications: Protocol Design and Ultra-Security Proof	Wireless channel state information (CSI) from intelligent vehicles to the roadside unit (RSU) is a must for vehicleto-infrastructure (V2I) communications in Internet of Vehicles, but easily suffers the risks of being attacked due to the publicly known and deterministic characteristic of PHY-layer pilots that are employed for CSI acquisition. This incurs the issue of wireless pilot authentication (WPA), that is, verifying the authenticity of pilots and claimed CSIs. In this paper, we, for multiantenna V2I orthogonal frequency division multiplexed communications, develop a PHY-layer cover-free (PHY-CF) coding theory to build up a secure WPA (SWPA) protocol. Here, we encode and convey vehicle pilot signals into diversified subcarrier activation patterns (SAPs) on the time-frequency domain by employing cover-free coding. We redesign the decoding procedure using the signal independence characteristic such that those encoded SAPs, though camouflaged by malicious signals and superimposed onto each other in wireless environment, could be separated, identified and decoded into the original pilots securely. For this protocol, we prove that perfect pilot conveying and separation could be both guaranteed. We formulate the pilot identification error probability (IEP) and show how PHY-CF coding could help position the location of attacker and reduce IEP to further achieve ultrasecurity. Considering 20 MHz long-term evolution bandwidth, we prove that the number of co-time co-frequency vehicles that are securely authenticated achieves up to 19 × X for X serving sectors of base station type RSU and the latency time of uplink data access is up to 1.5 ms, thus furthering the autonomous driving. Computer simulations comprehensively verify those benefits of proposed SWPA protocol.	https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8510793	0
Network Design for Accurate Vehicle Localization	Network-based localization plays a key role on the introduction of emerging road applications, such as connected autonomous driving. These applications demand unprecedented precise, reliable and secure positioning, with localization requirements below 1 m. This stringent demand is pushing for the use of road-side units (RSUs) from fifth generation and vehicular networks for accurate vehicle localization. However, these networks are not typically designed for positioning but for data communication purposes, which follow a different paradigm for the network deployment and operation. This paper provides design guidelines on dedicated network deployments with the aim of achieving accurate vehicle-to-infrastructure positioning in road scenarios. First, the network layout or site placement is assessed with a geometrical metric. Then, the minimum density of RSUs along the road is bounded with line-of-sight probability models for urban street and highway scenarios. Finally, the Cramér-Rao bound for joint time-of-arrival (ToA) and angle-of-arrival (AoA) localization is used to maximize the distance between RSUs along the road, by exploiting multi-antenna deployments. According to the simulation results, the network sites are recommended to be located at alternate sides of the road, with a maximum distance between RSUs of 40 and 230 m for urban and rural environments, respectively. Following these design guidelines, there is also the need to exploit antenna arrays to combine uplink ToA and AoA estimates, in order to ensure a vehicle location accuracy below one meter on the 95% of the cases. The use of eight antenna elements at the RSUs is found to reduce nearly one and a half times the minimum network density in highway localization deployments.	https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8671747	0
Design and Analysis of Secure Lightweight Remote User Authentication and Key Agreement Scheme in Internet of Drones Deployment	The Internet of Drones (IoD) provides a coordinated access to unmanned aerial vehicles that are referred as drones. The on-going miniaturization of sensors, actuators, and processors with ubiquitous wireless connectivity makes drones to be used in a wide range of applications ranging from military to civilian. Since most of the applications involved in the IoD are real-time based, the users are generally interested in accessing real-time information from drones belonging to a particular fly zone. This happens if we allow users to directly access real-time data from flying drones inside IoD environment and not from the server. This is a serious security breach which may deteriorate performance of any implemented solution in this IoD environment. To address this important issue in IoD, we propose a novel lightweight user authentication scheme in which a user in the IoD environment needs to access data directly from a drone provided that the user is authorized to access the data from that drone. The formal security verification using the broadly accepted automated validation of Internet security protocols and applications tool along with informal security analysis show that our scheme is secure against several known attacks. The performance comparison demonstrates that our scheme is efficient with respect to various parameters, and it provides better security as compared to those for the related existing schemes. Finally, the practical demonstration of our scheme is done using the widely accepted NS2 simulation.	https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8581510	0
Human-Centered Risk Assessment of an Automated Vehicle Using Vehicular Wireless Communication	This paper presents a human-centered risk assessment algorithm using vehicular communication for application to an automated driving vehicle. Vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) wireless communication has been implemented and fused with a radar sensor to obtain the prediction of the remote vehicle's motion. Based on the predicted behavior of remote vehicles, a collision risk and a human reaction time are determined for a human-centered active safety control intervention moment. The human-centered risk assessment algorithm has been incorporated into a collision avoidance algorithm to monitor threat vehicles ahead and to find the best intervention point. Effects of the vehicular communication on a perception and a control performance are investigated. The performance of the proposed algorithm has been investigated via computer simulations and vehicle tests. It has been shown from both simulations and vehicle tests that the proposed human-centered risk assessment algorithm with V2V communication decides a proper active safety intervention moment by reducing the chances of over/underestimate of a conventional radar-only system.	https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8353347	0
Locating Multiple GPS Jammers Using Networked UAVs	Recent technologies, such as, Internet of Things and cloud services, increases the usage of small and low-cost networked unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), which needs to be robust against malicious global positioning system (GPS) attacks. Due to the availability of low-cost GPS jammers in the commercial market, there has been a rising risk of multiple jammers and not just one. However, it is challenging to locate multiple jammers because the traditional jammer localization via multilateration is applicable for only a single jammer case. Also, during a jamming attack, the positioning capability of an on-board GPS receiver is compromised given its inability to track GPS signals. We propose a simultaneous localization of multiple jammers and receivers (SLMR) algorithm by analyzing the variation in the front-end signal power recorded by the GPS receivers on-board a network of UAVs. Our algorithm not only locates multiple jammers but also utilizes these malicious sources as additional navigation signals for positioning the UAVs. We design a Gaussian mixture probability hypothesis density filter over a graph framework, which is optimized using a Levenberg-Marquardt minimizer. Using a simulated experimental setup, we validate the convergence and localization accuracy of our SLMR algorithm for various cases, including attacks with a single jammer, multiple jammers, and a varying number of jammers. We also demonstrate that our SLMR algorithm is able to simultaneously locate multiple jammers and UAVs, even for a larger transmitted power of the jammers.	https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8629980	0
A Predictive Perception Model and Control Strategy for Collision-Free Autonomous Driving	A key issue in autonomous driving is the problem of decision logic, particularly, as it pertains to mixed traffic involving autonomous and human-driven vehicles. With this in mind, we develop an approach for modeling the interaction between autonomous and human-driven (or perhaps other autonomous) vehicles via game theory and assess the time evolution of potential collision paths via a reachability analysis of the solution set of a simple hybrid dynamical system that captures the kinematics of the lane-change process. We further utilize a control strategy based on model predictive control to develop a safety-assured motion profile on the part of the subject vehicle. This model is subsequently evaluated in multiple simulation scenarios as a function of a programmable safety assurance parameter. We should emphasize that the proposed approach is proactive in its outlook, as it considers a temporal horizon spanning several seconds and assumes a certain behavioral consistency on the part of the local traffic participants. As such it must be augmented with an appropriate reactive collision mitigation scheme that responds to immediate threats caused by abrupt behaviors that are not predictable via algorithmic schemes. Nevertheless, the scenarios studied here appear to produce intuitively reasonable behaviors that seem consistent with ordinary driving and highlight the prospects of this approach being implemented in autonomous driving strategies.	https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8563105	0
Improving Localization Accuracy in Connected Vehicle Networks Using Rao–Blackwellized Particle Filters: Theory, Simulations, and Experiments	A crucial function for automated vehicle technologies is accurate localization. Lane-level accuracy is not readily available from low-cost global navigation satellite system (GNSS) receivers because of factors such as multipath error and atmospheric bias. Approaches such as differential GNSS can improve localization accuracy, but usually require investment in expensive base stations. Connected vehicle technologies provide an alternative approach in improving the localization accuracy. It will be shown in this paper that localization accuracy can be enhanced using crude GNSS measurements from a group of connected vehicles, by matching their locations to a digital map. A Rao-Blackwellized particle filter is used to jointly estimate the common biases of the pseudo-ranges and the vehicle positions. Multipath biases, which introduce receiver-specific (non-common) error, are mitigated by a multi-hypothesis detection-rejection approach. The temporal correlation of the estimations is exploited through the prediction-update process. The proposed approach is compared with existing methods using both simulations and experimental results. It was found that the proposed algorithm can eliminate the common biases and reduce the localization error to below 1 m under open sky conditions.	https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8463586	0
Two-Stage Request Scheduling for Autonomous Vehicle Logistic System	Autonomous vehicles are expected to play an important role in handling the last mile logistics in intelligent transportation systems thanks to their unmanned nature and full-fledged controllability. Recently, an autonomous vehicle logistic system (AVLS) was proposed, which employs autonomous vehicles to serve logistic requests and utilize the excessive renewable energy generated by distributed generations. In this paper, we propose an optimization problem for AVLS to develop schedules for request allocation, vehicle routing, and battery charging. By considering the unique characteristics of AVLS, the proposed scheduling problem can exploit its advantages in goods delivery and renewable energy utilization over existing logistic request allocation algorithms. We formulate the problem as a mixed integer non-linear program. To improve its scalability, we also devise a two-stage scheduling methodology to approach the optimal solutions of the original problem. We conduct comprehensive simulations to assess the performance of the proposed request scheduling problem and two-stage scheduling methodology. The results indicate that the proposed problem can improve the efficacy of AVLS in terms of total travel distance and utilized renewable energy, and the two-stage methodology can develop near-optimal solutions with notably reduced computation time.	https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8403887	0
AgriColMap: Aerial-Ground Collaborative 3D Mapping for Precision Farming	The combination of aerial survey capabilities of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) with targeted intervention abilities of agricultural unmanned ground vehicles (UGVs) can significantly improve the effectiveness of robotic systems applied to precision agriculture. In this context, building and updating a common map of the field is an essential but challenging task. The maps built using robots of different types show differences in size, resolution, and scale, the associated geolocation data may be inaccurate and biased while the repetitiveness of both visual appearance and geometric structures found within agricultural contexts render classical map merging techniques ineffective. In this letter, we propose AgriColMap, a novel map registration pipeline that leverages a grid-based multimodal environment representation, which includes a vegetation index map and a digital surface model. We cast the data association problem between maps built from UAVs and UGVs as a multimodal, large displacement dense optical flow estimation. The dominant, coherent flows, selected using a voting scheme, are used as point-to-point correspondences to infer a preliminary nonrigid alignment between the maps. A final refinement is then performed, by exploiting only meaningful parts of the registered maps. We evaluate our system using real-world data for three fields with different crop species. The results show that our method outperforms several state-of-the-art map registration and matching techniques by a large margin, and has a higher tolerance to large initial misalignments. We release an implementation of the proposed approach along with the acquired datasets with this letter.	https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8620543	0
Cooperative Shock Waves Mitigation in Mixed Traffic Flow Environment	Human driver behavior strongly influences traffic flow by increasing the spread of shock waves in a downstream direction. This paper addresses the problem of traffic congestion mitigation in a mixed scenario composed of connected human-driven and autonomous vehicles. The control protocol, driving the longitudinal motion of the autonomous vehicles, is designed for damping down traffic waves. The effectiveness of the strategy, and ability to cope with multiple and time-varying delays originated by the non-ideal wireless communication among connected vehicles, is both analytically and numerically analyzed. The asymptotic stability of the algorithm is mathematically proved by leveraging a Lyapunov-Krasovskii functional, while the head-to-tail stability tool is exploited for the tuning of the control gains. The performance of the control strategy is disclosed by using hardware-in-the-loop real-time simulation for an exemplary pattern of three vehicles. The effectiveness of the proposed cooperative strategy in longer queues of vehicles is, instead, investigated through PLEXE, an inter-vehicular communication and mobility simulator that includes features for autonomous vehicles as well as for the realistic emulation of the IEEE 802.11p standard. The results confirm the robustness of the approach and its ability in damping disturbances and mitigating stop-and-go effects according to the theoretical derivation.	https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8602438	0
Distributed Robust PID Control For Leader Tracking in Uncertain Connected Ground Vehicles With V2V Communication Delay	The paper addresses the leader tracking problem for a platoon of connected autonomous vehicles in the presence of both homogeneous time-varying parameter uncertainties and vehicle-to-vehicle time-varying communication delay. To this aim, leveraging the multiagent systems (MAS) framework, a novel distributed robust proportional-integral-derivative control is proposed. The stability of the cohesive formation is analytically proved with a Lyapunov-Krasovskii approach by exploiting the descriptor transformation for time-delayed systems of neutral type. The delay-dependent robust stability conditions are expressed as a set of linear matrix inequalities allowing the proper tuning of the proportional, integral, and derivative actions implemented on each of the vehicles within the fleet. Extensive simulation analysis in different driving scenarios confirms the effectiveness of the theoretical derivation.	https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8673609	0
Machine Learning Inspired Sound-Based Amateur Drone Detection for Public Safety Applications	In recent years, popularity of unmanned air vehicles enormously increased due to their autonomous moving capability and applications in various domains. This also results in some serious security threats, that needs proper investigation and timely detection of the amateur drones (ADr) to protect the security sensitive institutions. In this paper, we propose the novel machine learning (ML) framework for detection and classification of ADr sounds out of the various sounds like bird, airplanes, and thunderstorm in the noisy environment. To extract the necessary features from ADr sound, Mel frequency cepstral coefficients (MFCC), and linear predictive cepstral coefficients (LPCC) feature extraction techniques are implemented. After feature extraction, support vector machines (SVM) with various kernels are adopted to accurately classify these sounds. The experimental results verify that SVM cubic kernel with MFCC outperform LPCC method by achieving around 96.7% accuracy for ADr detection. Moreover, the results verified that the proposed ML scheme has more than 17% detection accuracy, compared with correlation-based drone sound detection scheme that ignores ML prediction.	https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8616877	0
Mobility-Aware Multipath Communication for Unmanned Aerial Surveillance Systems	Wireless communication platforms of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), commonly known as drones, usually operate in dynamic conditions with highly fluctuating capacities and erratic wireless access to the network resources. Effective design for adequate, robust, and consistent communications from the drones to the control center (aka server) is thus necessary to facilitate the implementation of the UAV system. Multipath TCP has the potential to exploit heterogeneous wireless paths and achieve robust bandwidth by controlling the dynamics of the convoy of drones. In this paper, we make use of fluid approach for proposing a generic system architecture toward a control mechanism for coordinating the convoy of drones. Moreover, we model multipath TCP and study their applications for the control scenario of a convoy of drones with three different communication interfaces, representing the head, tail, and the middle of the convoy. The access is through a satellite and several WiFi access points (APs) communicating to the server with time-variant wireless channel, subject to the dynamic mobility and distance of APs from the convoy's head and tail. The traffic on different paths governed by the flow control based on the movement and position of the convoy enable us to investigate the performance and convergence of communication system dynamics. In particular, Lyapunov theory is adopted to derive the stability conditions of the dynamics over the mobility of the convoy.	https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8700598	0
An Efficient B-Spline-Based Kinodynamic Replanning Framework for Quadrotors	Trajectory replanning for quadrotors is essential to enable fully autonomous flight in unknown environments. Hierarchical motion planning frameworks, which combine path planning with path parameterization, are popular due to their time efficiency. However, the path planning cannot properly deal with nonstatic initial states of the quadrotor, which may result in nonsmooth or even dynamically infeasible trajectories. In this article, we present an efficient kinodynamic replanning framework by exploiting the advantageous properties of the B-spline, which facilitates dealing with the nonstatic state and guarantees safety and dynamical feasibility. Our framework starts with an efficient B-spline-based kinodynamic (EBK) search algorithm, which finds a feasible trajectory with minimum control effort and time. To compensate for the discretization induced by the EBK search, an elastic optimization approach is proposed to refine the control point placement to the optimal location. Systematic comparisons against the state-of-the-art are conducted to validate the performance. Comprehensive onboard experiments using two different vision-based quadrotors are carried out showing the general applicability of the framework.	https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8811597	0
Throughput Maximization for UAV-Enabled Wireless Powered Communication Networks	This paper studies an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV)-enabled wireless powered communication network (WPCN), in which a UAV is dispatched as a mobile access point (AP) to serve a set of ground users periodically. The UAV employs the radio frequency (RF) wireless power transfer (WPT) to charge the users in the downlink, and the users use the harvested RF energy to send independent information to the UAV in the uplink. Unlike the conventional WPCN with fixed APs, the UAV-enabled WPCN can exploit the mobility of the UAV via trajectory design, jointly with the wireless resource allocation optimization, to maximize the system throughput. In particular, we aim to maximize the uplink common (minimum) throughput among all ground users over a finite UAV's flight period, subject to its maximum speed constraint and the users' energy neutrality constraints. The resulted problem is nonconvex and thus difficult to be solved optimally. To tackle this challenge, we first consider an ideal case without the UAV's maximum speed constraint, and obtain the optimal solution to the relaxed problem. The optimal solution shows that the UAV should successively hover above a finite number of ground locations for downlink WPT, as well as above each of the ground users for uplink communication. Next, we consider the general problem with the UAV's maximum speed constraint. Based on the above multilocation-hovering solution, we first propose an efficient successive hover-and-fly trajectory design, jointly with the downlink and uplink wireless resource allocation, and then propose a locally optimal solution by applying the techniques of alternating optimization and successive convex programming (SCP). Numerical results show that the proposed UAV-enabled WPCN achieves significant throughput gains over the conventional WPCN with fixed-location AP.	https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8489918	0
A Novel Alternative Optimization Method for Joint Power and Trajectory Design in UAV-Enabled Wireless Network	This correspondence aims to maximize the average throughput via the joint design of the transmit power and trajectory for unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV)-enabled network. The conventional way to tackle this problem is based on the alternating optimization (AO) method by iteratively updating power and trajectory until convergence, resulting in a non-convex trajectory subproblem which is difficult to deal with. To develop more efficient methods, we propose a novel AO method by incorporating both power and trajectory into an intermediate variable, and then iteratively updating power and the newly introduced variable. This novel variable transformation makes it easier to decompose the original problem into two convex subproblems, namely a throughput maximization subproblem and a feasibility subproblem. Consequently, both of these subproblems can be solved in a globally optimal fashion. We further propose a low-complexity algorithm for the feasibility subproblem by exploiting the alternating directional method of multipliers (ADMM), whose updating step is performed in closed-form solutions. Simulation results demonstrate that our proposed method reduces the computation time by orders of magnitude, while achieving higher performance than the conventional methods.	https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8828093	0
Transceiver Design and Multihop D2D for UAV IoT Coverage in Disasters	When natural disasters strike, the coverage for Internet of Things (IoT) may be severely destroyed, due to the damaged communications infrastructure. Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) can be exploited as flying base stations to provide emergency coverage for IoT, due to its mobility and flexibility. In this paper, we propose multiantenna transceiver design and multihop device-to-device (D2D) communication to guarantee the reliable transmission and extend the UAV coverage for IoT in disasters. First, multihop D2D links are established to extend the coverage of UAV emergency networks due to the constrained transmit power of the UAV. In particular, a shortest-path-routing algorithm is proposed to establish the D2D links rapidly with minimum nodes. The closed-form solutions for the number of hops and the outage probability are derived for the uplink and downlink. Second, the transceiver designs for the UAV uplink and downlink are studied to optimize the performance of UAV transmission. Due to the nonconvexity of the problem, they are first transformed into convex ones and then, low-complexity algorithms are proposed to solve them efficiently. Simulation results show the performance improvement in the throughput and outage probability by the proposed schemes for UAV wireless coverage of IoT in disasters.	https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8502795	0
Learning to Communicate in UAV-Aided Wireless Networks: Map-Based Approaches	We consider a scenario where an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV)-mounted flying base station is providing data communication services to a number of radio nodes spread over the ground. We focus on the problem of resource-constrained UAV trajectory design with: 1) optimal channel parameters learning and 2) optimal data throughput as key objectives, respectively. While the problem of throughput optimized trajectories has been addressed in prior works, the formulation of an optimized trajectory to efficiently discover the propagation parameters has not yet been addressed. When it comes to the communication phase, the advantage of this paper comes from the exploitation of a 3-D city map. Unfortunately, the communication trajectory design based on the raw map data leads to an intractable optimization problem. To solve this issue, we introduce a map compression method that allows us to tackle the problem with standard optimization tools. The trajectory optimization is then combined with a node scheduling algorithm. The advantages of the learning-optimized trajectory and of the map compression method are illustrated in the context of intelligent Internet of Things data harvesting.	https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8525324	0
Generalized Wireless-Powered Communications: When to Activate Wireless Power Transfer?	Wireless-powered communication network (WPCN) is a key technology to power energy limited massive devices, such as on-board wireless sensors in autonomous vehicles, for Internet-of-Things applications. Conventional WPCNs rely only on dedicated downlink wireless power transfer (WPT), which is practically inefficient due to the significant energy loss in wireless signal propagation. Meanwhile, ambient energy harvesting is highly appealing as devices can scavenge energy from various existing energy sources (e.g., solar energy and cellular signals). Unfortunately, the randomness of the availability of these energy sources cannot guarantee stable communication services. Motivated by the above statements, we consider a generalized WPCN where the devices can not only harvest energy from a dedicated multiple-antenna power station (PS), but can also exploit stored energy stemming from ambient energy harvesting. Since the dedicated WPT consumes system resources, if the stored energy is sufficient, WPT may not be needed to maximize the weighted sum rate. To analytically characterize this phenomenon, we derive the condition for WPT activation and reveal how it is affected by the different system parameters. Subsequently, we further derive the optimal resource allocation policy for the cases that WPT is activated and deactivated, respectively. In particular, it is found that when WPT is activated, the optimal energy beamforming at the PS does not depend on the devices' stored energy, which is shown to lead to a new unfairness issue. Simulation results verify our theoretical findings and demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed optimal resource allocation.	https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8742610	0
Novel Control Approaches for Demand Response With Real-Time Pricing Using Parallel and Distributed Consensus-Based ADMM	This paper studies the automated demand response (DR) problem in smart grids equipped with information and communication technology networks, where power generating and consuming units can exchange information as a multiagent system (MAS), and a real-time pricing (RTP) scheme is proposed. When the communication graph among agents is connected, a novel parallel and distributed consensus-based algorithm is proposed to derive an RTP scheme to facilitate DR, and when communication uncertainties exist, a robust consensus algorithm is proposed to cease the effect of uncertainties. Next, this paper proposes a novel control mechanism to tackle the problem of disconnected communication among agents, e.g., under cyber-attacks, by employing the so-called mixed communication-broadcast control architecture where the underlying ideas are twofold. First, each area in the grid associated with a connected subgraph is controlled by a MAS to guarantee the power balance and to reach consensus on the local electric price for that area. Second, a supervisory unit observes those local electric prices to calculate the global electric price for the whole grid and then broadcasts to all units so that they can properly adjust their output powers. Simulations are carried out on the IEEE 39-bus system to validate the proposed control mechanisms.	https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8556392	0
Deployment Algorithms of Flying Base Stations: 5G and Beyond With UAVs	Exploiting unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) as flying base stations (BSs) to assist the terrestrial cellular networks is promising in 5G and beyond. Despite the inherent potentials, one challenging problem is how to optimally deploy multiple UAVs to achieve on-demand coverage for ground user equipment (UE). In this article, we model the deployment problem as minimizing the number of UAVs and maximizing the load balance among them, which is subject to two main constraints, i.e., UAVs should form a robust backbone network and they should keep connected with the fixed BSs. To solve this optimization problem with low complexity, we decompose the problem into two subproblems and propose a hybrid algorithm to solve them stepwise. First, a centralized greedy search algorithm is used to heuristically obtain the minimum number of UAVs and their suboptimal positions in a discontinuous space. Then, a distributed motion algorithm is adopted which enables each UAV to autonomously control its motion toward the optimal position in a continuous space. The proposed algorithm is applicable to various scenarios where UAVs are deployed alone or with fixed BSs regardless of the UE distribution. Extensive simulations validate the proposed algorithm.	https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8796414	0
UAV-Enabled Spatial Data Sampling in Large-Scale IoT Systems Using Denoising Autoencoder Neural Network	Internet of Things (IoT) technology has been pervasively applied to environmental monitoring, due to the advantages of low cost and flexible deployment of IoT enabled systems. In many large-scale IoT systems, accurate and efficient data sampling and reconstruction is among the most critical requirements, since this can relieve the data rate of trunk link for data uploading while ensure data accuracy. To address the related challenges, we have proposed an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) enabled spatial data sampling scheme in this paper using denoising autoencoder (DAE) neural network. More specifically, a UAV-enabled edge-cloud collaborative IoT system architecture is first developed for data processing in large-scale IoT monitoring systems, where UAV is utilized as mobile edge computing device. Based on this system architecture, the UAV-enabled spatial data sampling scheme is further proposed, where the wireless sensor nodes of large-scale IoT systems are clustered by a newly developed bounded-size K-means clustering algorithm. A neural network model, i.e., DAE, is applied to each cluster for data sampling and reconstruction, by exploitation of both linear and nonlinear spatial correlation among data samples. Simulations have been conducted and the results indicate that the proposed scheme has improved data reconstruction accuracy under the sampling ratio without introducing extra complexity, as compared to the compressive sensing-based method.	https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8496746	0
Funneled Bayesian Optimization for Design, Tuning and Control of Autonomous Systems	In this paper, we tackle several problems that appear in robotics and autonomous systems: algorithm tuning, automatic control, and intelligent design. All those problems share in common that they can be mapped to global optimization problems where evaluations are expensive. Bayesian optimization (BO) has become a fundamental global optimization algorithm in many problems where sample efficiency is of paramount importance. BO uses a probabilistic surrogate model to learn the response function and reduce the number of samples required. Gaussian processes (GPs) have become a standard surrogate model for their flexibility to represent a distribution over functions. In a black-box settings, the common assumption is that the underlying function can be modeled with a stationary GP. In this paper, we present a novel kernel function specially designed for BO, that allows nonstationary behavior of the surrogate model in an adaptive local region. This kernel is able to reconstruct nonstationarity even with the irregular sampling distribution that arises from BO. Furthermore, in our experiments, we found that this new kernel results in an improved local search (exploitation), without penalizing the global search (exploration) in many applications. We provide extensive results in well-known optimization benchmarks, machine learning hyperparameter tuning, reinforcement learning, and control problems, and UAV wing optimization. The results show that the new method is able to outperform the state of the art in BO both in stationary and nonstationary problems.	https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8303767	0
Magnetic Augmented Self-sensing Flexible Electroadhesive Grippers	Current electroadhesion (EA) grippers cannot be used to lift objects with limited contact areas. Current electromagnetic adhesion (MA) grippers cannot be used to grip nonferrous materials. Here, we combine EA and MA into a monolithic, electrically controllable, flexible, and hybrid electro/magneto-adhesive (E/MA), to offer EA grippers augmented with magnetoadhesion and MA grippers augmented with electroadhesion. This E/MA was achieved by exploiting two intertwined coplanar coils inspired by Tesla's flat bifilar coil. By appropriate electrical connections an electromagnetic field is generated - driving magnetic attraction- or an electric field is generated-delivering electroadhesion-or both fields can be generated simultaneously. As a result, the E/MA grippers cannot only be used to lift ferrous and nonferrous materials, but also low-density objects, such as office paper clips. We also present a customized capacitance measurement method to enable an autonomous material handling system without embedding external sensors. E/MA grippers have the potential to expand the capabilities and impact of soft robotics and industrial gripper systems.	https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8662685	0
Performance Analysis and Optimization of UAV Integrated Terrestrial Cellular Network	Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) have been extensively applied as aerial access points to assist the terrestrial wireless network. Despite the inherent potential, nevertheless, it still remains to explore whether the gain of UAV access points (UAPs) could be fully harvested, which is critically dependent on the factors including the flight altitude and deployment density of UAPs. In this light, we investigate the performance of a downlink UAV integrated terrestrial cellular network (UTCN) and analytically study the influence of varying UAP altitude and density on the spatial throughput (ST) of UTCN. In particular, we obtain the UAP altitude upper bound, below which more line-of-sight (LOS) connections could be provided to improve network ST. Otherwise, cross-layer interference over the LOS paths becomes dominant, which results in significant degradation of network ST. More importantly, we reveal the limitation of the application of UAPs by showing that there exists a critical UAP density, beyond which network ST would encounter a rapid decrease. To fully exploit the potential of UAPs, we further tailor a probabilistic interference avoidance scheme and study the optimization of the UAP activated probability. Remarkably, network ST could be substantially improved using the optimized activated probability, i.e., network ST could increase with the growing UAP density and converge to a positive constant instead of zero in the dense UAP regime. Therefore, the results of this paper could provide insight on the deployment and optimization of UTCN.	https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8515027	0
Aircraft Landing Using Dynamic Two-Dimensional Image-Based Guidance Control	This paper proposes a two-dimensional (2-D) image-based controller to automatically steer a fixed-wing unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) during the first three stages of landing: alignment, glide-slope, and flare. Observable image features of the runway and its textured ground are exploited to derive a feedback controller for the automatic maneuver. The proposed controller ensures the horizontal position alignment and a smooth touchdown of the aircraft without estimating the height above the runway. In addition, the 2-D image-based control structure adopted also enforces wind disturbance rejection, without the need for an explicit wind estimator. Simulation results are presented to illustrate the performance of the controller.	https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8534415	0
Rechargeable Multi-UAV Aided Seamless Coverage for QoS-Guaranteed IoT Networks	Due to their high flexibility, high maneuverability, and line-of-sight (LOS) predominant channel, unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) serving as flying base stations have received a lot of interest in emerging Internet of Things (IoT) networks. This article studies the energy-efficient cooperative strategy of rechargeable multi-UAVs for providing seamless coverage and long-term information services for IoT nodes. Considering the limited cruising duration of the UAV, multiple rechargeable UAVs are capable of constructing a closed chain for the sake of alternately supporting IoT nodes. Moreover, a joint IoT node assignment and UAV configuration optimization problem is proposed in order to maximize the energy efficiency of the system. Since the proposed problem is a mixed-integer nonconvex problem, we divide it into three subproblems, namely, node assignment scheduling, UAV trajectory planning, and transmit power control. By exploiting sequential convex optimization techniques, we reformulate the nonconvex subproblems into three convex optimization problems which can be solved within the polynomial time. A block coordinate descent-based iterative algorithm is proposed for solving these energy-efficiency oriented subproblems. Finally, the simulation results corroborate the effectiveness of our proposed method.	https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8847391	0
Toward Accurate Vehicle State Estimation Under Non-Gaussian Noises	Vehicle state including location and motion information plays an important role in various applications such as Internet of Vehicles (IoV), autonomous cars, and driving safety monitoring. Achieving accurate vehicle state is a challenging task in those applications due to the noise disturbances. Recent studies suggest that noise is not generally Gaussian distributed and many physical environments can be handled more accurately as non-Gaussian rather than Gaussian model. Inspired by this observation, we strive to improve the vehicle state estimation by investigating the effects of that assumption when process and measurement noises are non-Gaussian distributed. Here, process noise represents the noise during the state information processing. To that end, we exploit the generalized error distribution (GED) to compute the non-Gaussian probability density during the vehicle state estimation. We then derive extensive theoretical analysis targeting to estimate the parameters such as the mean and the variance (or covariance matrix) related to both process and measurement noises and reduce the computational burden of the distribution. Further, we propose a non-Gaussian particle filter for vehicle state estimation (nGPF-VSE) algorithm wherein we utilize the genetic operator resampling (GOR) technique to enhance the efficiency of particle filter (PF) relying on the selection of the importance sampling distribution. To evaluate the performance of the proposed approach, we conduct numerical simulations on the popular system of state-space equations and a real experiment for estimating the vehicle state. The results from the numerical simulations, experimental data and the statistical evaluation confirm that nGPF-VSE outperforms existing methods in terms of vehicle state accuracy.	https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8830463	0
Detecting Vehicle Anomaly in the Edge via Sensor Consistency and Frequency Characteristic	Autonomous vehicles are expected to significantly enhance the human mobility. However, recently researchers have discovered and demonstrated some attacks on vehicles, which have caused a panic among the public. Furthermore, these attacks have demonstrated that the security issue is still one of the major challenges of vehicles. In this paper, we propose a novel edge computing based anomaly detection, coined edge computing based vehicle anomaly detection (EVAD), which exploits edge based sensor data fusion to identify the anomaly events. The time domain property, i.e., the correlation between different intra-vehicle sensors, and the frequency domain property of sensor data are utilized to judge whether an anomaly has occurred within the vehicle. Especially, to reduce the computation overhead and improve the performance, multiple sensors will be organized as ring architecture, which is a tradeoff of detection accuracy and complexity. In addition, the major components (e.g., anomaly detection module) of EVAD are embedded in edge computing devices, which make the anomaly detection be more efficient and privacy preserving. Meanwhile, a more appropriate model is generated on the cloud server, of which computation overhead maybe heavy for edge computing devices. This paper evaluates the performance of EVAD under different scenarios, and the experimental results demonstrate its feasibility and efficiency. The average true positive rate achieves 99.5% with 1% false positive rate.	https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8675434	0
Learning Driver Braking Behavior Using Smartphones, Neural Networks and the Sliding Correlation Coefficient: Road Anomaly Case Study	This paper focuses on the automated learning of driver braking “signature” in the presence of road anomalies. Our motivation is to improve driver experience using preview information from navigation maps. Smartphones facilitate, due to their unprecedented market penetration, the large-scale deployment of advanced driver assistance systems. On the other hand, it is challenging to exploit smartphone sensor data because of the fewer and lower quality signals, compared to the ones on board. Methods for detecting braking behavior using smartphones exist, however, most of them focus only on harsh events. Additionally, only a few studies correlate longitudinal driving behavior with the road condition. In this paper, a new method, based on deep neural networks and the sliding correlation coefficient, is proposed for the spatio-temporal correlation of road anomalies and driver behavior. A unique deep neural network structure, that requires minimum tuning, is proposed. Extensive field trials were conducted and vehicle motion was recorded using smartphones and a data acquisition system, comprising an inertial measurement unit and differential GPS. The proposed method was validated using the probabilistic Receiver Operating Characteristics method. The method proves to be a robust and flexible tool for self-learning driver behavior.	https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8294049	0
Road Segmentation of Unmanned Aerial Vehicle Remote Sensing Images Using Adversarial Network With Multiscale Context Aggregation	Semantic segmentation using adversarial networks has proved to be effective in image processing fields. However, two problems need to be solved in the field of the road segmentation of unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) remote sensing images. One is the occupied proportion of road area in UAV remote sensing images; the other is that the constant size of convolutional kernel cannot deal with multiscale feature very well. To solve these two problems, this paper proposed a road segmentation model that combined the adversarial networks with multiscale context aggregation. First, the output feature-maps of three scales (0.5n, 1n, 2n) were obtained, based on an end-to-end training from image segmentation network. Second, after the convolution and deconvolution operations, the processed images were unified to the size scale of original images. Third, with the pixel-by-pixel addition method, the three scales of image feature (0.5n, 1n, 2n) were merged together, then inputted into the discriminative network. Finally, the errors were obtained and propagated backwards compared with the label, and then the parameters of a generative network and a discriminative network could be updated. Further, the segmented results were compared with those from normal adversarial networks, Linknet and D-linknet, and were developed with the morphological operation. The research results show that the proposed model can improve the precision of road segmentation from UAV images with multiscale context aggregation and the regularization property of adversarial networks.	https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8700287	0
Cooperative Trajectory Planning for Haptic Shared Control Between Driver and Automation in Highway Driving	This paper addresses the driver-automation shared driving control for lane keeping and obstacle avoidance of automated vehicles in highway traffic. The proposed shared control framework is established from a novel cooperative trajectory planning algorithm and a fuzzy steering controller. Based on polynomial functions, the cooperative trajectory planning is formulated by judiciously exploiting the information on the maneuver decision, the conflict management, and the driver monitoring. As a result, the planned trajectory of the vehicle is continuously adapted according to the driver's actions and intentions. By means of Lyapunov stability arguments, sufficient conditions in terms of linear matrix inequalities are given to design a Takagi-Sugeno fuzzy model-based controller. This robust steering controller provides a necessary assistive torque to track the planned vehicle trajectory. The new shared driving control framework allows reducing effectively the driver-automation conflict issue while offering the driver more freedom to swerve within a predefined lane. The advantages of the proposed approach are evaluated using both objective and subjective results, experimentally obtained from several human drivers and an advanced interactive dynamic driving simulator.	https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8624569	0
Toward Privacy-Preserving Valet Parking in Autonomous Driving Era	Automated valet parking, deemed as a key milestone on the way to autonomous driving, has great potential to improve the “last-mile” driving experience for users. On the other hand, it triggers serious risks on vehicle theft and location privacy leakage. To address these issues, we propose a secure and privacy-preserving automated valet parking protocol for self-driving vehicles. The proposed protocol is characterized by extending anonymous authentication to support two-factor authentication with mutual traceability for reducing the risks of vehicle theft and preventing the privacy leakage of users in automated valet parking. Specifically, based on one-time password and secure mobile devices, two-factor authentication is achieved between vehicles and smartphones to ensure vehicle security in remote pickup. By exploiting the BBS+ signature and the Cuckoo filter, user location privacy is protected against the curious parking lots and service providers. In addition, the traceable tags are designed to enable a trusted authority to identify the vehicles and users for localizing a stolen or missing vehicle and preventing the slandering of greedy users. Finally, formal security analysis on the proposed protocol is given to show that the authentication, anonymity, and traceability can be reduced to standard hard assumptions, and performance evaluation demonstrates the proposed protocol is efficient and practical to be implemented in autonomous driving era.	https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8624339	0
Parallel planning: a new motion planning framework for autonomous driving	Motion planning is one of the most significant technologies for autonomous driving. To make motion planning models able to learn from the environment and to deal with emergency situations, a new motion planning framework called as “parallel planning” is proposed in this paper. In order to generate sufficient and various training samples, artificial traffic scenes are firstly constructed based on the knowledge from the reality. A deep planning model which combines a convolutional neural network (CNN) with the Long Short-Term Memory module (LSTM) is developed to make planning decisions in an end-toend mode. This model can learn from both real and artificial traffic scenes and imitate the driving style of human drivers. Moreover, a parallel deep reinforcement learning approach is also presented to improve the robustness of planning model and reduce the error rate. To handle emergency situations, a hybrid generative model including a variational auto-encoder (VAE) and a generative adversarial network (GAN) is utilized to learn from virtual emergencies generated in artificial traffic scenes. While an autonomous vehicle is moving, the hybrid generative model generates multiple video clips in parallel, which correspond to different potential emergency scenarios. Simultaneously, the deep planning model makes planning decisions for both virtual and current real scenes. The final planning decision is determined by analysis of real observations. Leveraging the parallel planning approach, the planner is able to make rational decisions without heavy calculation burden when an emergency occurs.	https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8405356	0
Decision-Making Framework for Autonomous Driving at Road Intersections: Safeguarding Against Collision, Overly Conservative Behavior, and Violation Vehicles	In this paper, we propose a decision-making framework for autonomous driving at road intersections that determines appropriate maneuvers for an autonomous vehicle to navigate an intersection safely and efficiently (regarding making progress), even in the face of violation vehicles-one of the most challenging tasks in the domain of autonomous vehicles. The proposed framework uses a digital map to predict future paths of observed vehicles and then uses the predicted future paths to identify potential threats (vehicles) and collision areas, regardless of whether observed vehicles are obeying traffic rules at the intersection. Next, under an independent and distributed reasoning structure, it systematically, reliably, and robustly assesses the potential threats, even under incomplete and uncertain noise data, by way of a threat measure, Bayesian networks, and time window filtering. It then uses this information to determine appropriate maneuvers for the autonomous vehicle to navigate the intersection safely and efficiently. We have tested and evaluated the proposed framework through in-vehicle testing on a closed urban test road under traffic conditions inclusive of nonviolation and violation vehicles. In-vehicle testing results show the performance of the proposed framework to be sufficiently reliable for autonomous driving at intersections regarding reliability, robustness, safety, and efficiency.	https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8370800	0
iSTRICT: An Interdependent Strategic Trust Mechanism for the Cloud-Enabled Internet of Controlled Things	The cloud-enabled Internet of controlled things (IoCT) envisions a network of sensors, controllers, and actuators connected through a local cloud in order to intelligently control physical devices. Because cloud services are vulnerable to advanced persistent threats (APTs), each device in the IoCT must strategically decide whether to trust cloud services that may be compromised. In this paper, we present iSTRICT, an interdependent strategic trust mechanism for the cloud-enabled IoCT. iSTRICT is composed of three interdependent layers. In the cloud layer, iSTRICT uses FlipIt games to conceptualize APTs. In the communication layer, it captures the interaction between devices and the cloud using signaling games. In the physical layer, iSTRICT uses optimal control to quantify the utilities in the higher level games. Best response dynamics link the three layers in an overall “game-of-games,” for which the outcome is captured by a concept called Gestalt Nash equilibrium (GNE). We prove the existence of a GNE under a set of natural assumptions and develop an adaptive algorithm to iteratively compute the equilibrium. Finally, we apply iSTRICT to trust management for autonomous vehicles that rely on measurements from remote sources. We show that strategic trust in the communication layer achieves a worst-case probability of compromise for any attack and defense costs in the cyber layer.	https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8543871	0
The Foldable Drone: A Morphing Quadrotor That Can Squeeze and Fly	The recent advances in state estimation, perception, and navigation algorithms have significantly contributed to the ubiquitous use of quadrotors for inspection, mapping, and aerial imaging. To further increase the versatility of quadrotors, recent works investigated the use of an adaptive morphology, which consists of modifying the shape of the vehicle during flight to suit a specific task or environment. However, these works either increase the complexity of the platform or decrease its controllability. In this letter, we propose a novel, simpler, yet effective morphing design for quadrotors consisting of a frame with four independently rotating arms that fold around the main frame. To guarantee stable flight at all times, we exploit an optimal control strategy that adapts on the fly to the drone morphology. We demonstrate the versatility of the proposed adaptive morphology in different tasks, such as negotiation of narrow gaps, close inspection of vertical surfaces, and object grasping and transportation. The experiments are performed on an actual, fully autonomous quadrotor relying solely on onboard visual-inertial sensors and compute. No external motion tracking systems and computers are used. This is the first work showing stable flight without requiring any symmetry of the morphology.	https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8567932	0
Blockchain-Based Mutual-Healing Group Key Distribution Scheme in Unmanned Aerial Vehicles Ad-Hoc Network	A dynamic group key is required for secure communication in the Unmanned Aerial Vehicles Ad-Hoc Network (UAANET). However, due to the unreliable wireless channel and high-dynamic topology of UAANET, the situation that a node is missing certain group key broadcast messages occurs frequently. Existing group key distribution schemes cannot be directly applied to the UAANET, because of their poor security or real-time. Therefore, we present a mutual-healing group key distribution scheme based on the blockchain. Firstly, the Ground Control Station (GCS) builds a private blockchain where the group keys distributed by GCS are recorded. Meanwhile, through the blockchain, a dynamic list of UAANET membership certificates is also managed. According to different attack models, a basic mutual-healing protocol and an enhanced one are designed based on the Longest-Lost-Chain mechanism to recover the node's lost group keys with the aid of its neighbors. Security analysis and extensive experiments show that, compared with the existing mutual-healing schemes, our proposed solution can effectively resist various attacks with small overhead on time and storage.	https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8846098	0

Routing and Scheduling for Hybrid Truck-Drone Collaborative Parcel Delivery With Independent and Truck-Carried Drones	The enabling Internet-of-Things (IoT) technology has inspired a large number of novel platforms and applications. One popular IoT platform is unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs, also known as drone). Benefiting from the intrinsic flexibility, convenience, and low cost, UAVs have great potentials to be utilized in various civil applications, including parcel delivery. However, suffering from limited payloads and battery capacities, it is uneconomical for UAVs to perform parcel delivery tasks independently. To conquer the drawbacks of low payloads and battery capacities, people propose to employ both trucks and drones to construct truck-drone parcel delivery systems. However, previous works only leverage either independent drones or truck-carried drones to collaborate with trucks. In contrast, in this article we propose to simultaneously employ trucks, truck-carried drones, and independent drones to construct a more efficient truck-drone parcel delivery system. We claim that such a hybrid parcel delivery system can fully exploit the complementary benefits of the three platforms. We propose a novel routing and scheduling algorithm, referred to as hybrid truck-drone delivery (HTDD) algorithm, to solve the hybrid parcel delivery problem, wherein M drones carried by M trucks, together with N independent drones, cooperate to deliver parcels to customers distributed in a wide region. The experimental results show that our algorithm outperforms the existing solutions which employ either independent drones or truck-carried drones.	https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8824100	0
Is Fragmentation a Threat to the Success of the Internet of Things?	Internet of Things (IoT) aims to bring connectivity to almost every objects, i.e., things, found in the physical space. It extends connectivity to everyday things, however, such increase in the connectivity creates many prominent challenges. Context: Generally, IoT opens the door for new applications for machine-to-machine and human-to-human communications. The current trend of collaborating, distributed teams through the Internet, mobile communications, and autonomous entities, e.g., robots, is the first phase of the IoT to develop and deliver diverse services and applications. However, such collaborations is threatened by the fragmentation that we witness in the industry nowadays as it brings difficulty to integrate the diverse technologies of the various objects found in IoT systems. Diverse technologies induce interoperability issues while designing and developing various services and applications, hence, limiting the possibility of reusing the data, more specifically, the software (including frameworks, firmware, applications programming interfaces, and user interfaces) as well as of facing issues, like security threats and bugs, when developing new services or applications. Different aspects of handling data collection ranging from discovering smart sensors for data collection, integrating and applying reasoning on them must be available to provide interoperability and flexibility to the diverse objects interacting in the system. However, such approaches are bound to be challenged in future IoT scenarios as they bring substantial performance impairments in settings with the very large number of collaborating devices and technologies. Objective: We raise the awareness of the community about the lack of interoperability among technologies developed for IoT and challenges that their integration poses. We also provide guidelines for researchers and practitioners interested in connecting IoT networks and devices to develop services and applications. Method: We apply the methods advocated by the evidence-based software engineering paradigm. This paradigm and its core tool, the systematic literature review (SLR), were introduced to the software-engineering research community early 2004 to help researchers and industry systematically and objectively gather and aggregate evidences about different topics. In this paper, we conduct an SLR of both IoT interoperability issues and the state-of-practice of IoT technologies in the industry, highlighting the integration challenges related to the IoT that have significantly shifted the landscape of Internet-based collaborative services and applications nowadays. Results: Our SLR identifies a number of studies from journals, conferences, and workshops with the highest quality in the field. This SLR reports different trends, including frameworks and technologies, for the IoT for better comprehension of the paradigm and discusses the integration and interoperability challenges across the different layers of this technology while shedding light on the current IoT state-of-practice. It also discusses some future research directions for the community.	https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8424819	0
AKM-IoV: Authenticated Key Management Protocol in Fog Computing-Based Internet of Vehicles Deployment	Internet of Vehicles (IoV) is an intelligent application of Internet of Things (IoT) in smart transportation that takes intelligent commitments to the passengers to improve traffic safety and efficiency, and generate a more enjoyable driving and riding environment. Fog cloud-based IoV is another variant of mobile cloud computing where vehicular cloud and Internet can co-operate in more effective way in IoV. However, more increasing dependence on wireless communication, control, and computing technology makes IoV more dangerous to prospective attacks. For secure communication among vehicles, road-side units, fog and cloud servers, we design a secure authenticated key management protocol in fog computing-based IoV deployment, called AKM-IoV. In the designed AKM-IoV, after mutual authentication between communicating entities in IoV they establish session keys for secure communications. AKM-IoV is tested for its security analysis using the formal security analysis under the widely accepted real-or-random (ROR) model, informal, and formal security verification using the broadly accepted automated validation of Internet security protocols and applications (AVISPAs) tool. The practical demonstration of AKM-IoV is shown using the NS2 simulation. In addition, a detailed comparative study is conducted to show the efficiency and functionality and security features supported by AKM-IoV as compared to other existing recent protocols.	https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8740937	0
A Trust-Based Active Detection for Cyber-Physical Security in Industrial Environments	For the cyber-physical systems (CPS) in the smart industrial environments, a larger amount of smart sensor nodes, processors and actuators are deployed to sense information from physical world, which is vulnerable to be attacked because the nodes are deployed in unattended areas. Security is a pivotal issue for CPS, therefore, a trust-based active detection (TBAD) scheme is proposed for improving the reliability of collecting data packets and reducing the data redundancy. In TBAD scheme, the trust of the nodes is evaluated by the neighboring nodes and the evaluation results are added into the header of data packets. Thus, according to the reliability of data packets collected by the unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV), the trust of sensor nodes is evaluated by the UAV. In addition, the evaluation trust of nodes stored in the header of data packets will be detected when the UAV suspects the stored trust of sensor nodes. Then, the trust of corresponding sensor nodes is adjusted according to the detection results. The sensor nodes with higher trust are selected to form movement trajectory. A series of simulation experiments are conducted to evaluate the performance of the scheme. The results illustrate that the proposed scheme can greatly improve the efficiency and security of data routing in CPS.	https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8787570	0
Capacity and Delay of Unmanned Aerial Vehicle Networks With Mobility	Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) are widely exploited in environment monitoring, search-and-rescue, etc. However, the mobility and short flight duration of UAVs bring challenges for UAV networking. In this paper, we study the UAV networks with n UAVs acting as aerial sensors. UAVs generally have short flight duration and need to frequently get energy replenishment from the control station. Hence, the returning UAVs bring the data of the UAVs along the returning paths to the control station with a store-carry-and-forward (SCF) mode. A critical range for the distance between the UAV and the control station is discovered. Within the critical range, the per-node capacity of the SCF mode is θ(n/logn) times higher than that of the multihop mode. However, the per-node capacity of the SCF mode outside the critical range decreases with the distance between the UAV and the control station. To eliminate the critical range, a mobility control scheme is proposed such that the capacity scaling laws of the SCF mode are the same for all UAVs, which improves the capacity performance of UAV networks. Moreover, the delay of the SCF mode is derived. The impact of the size of the entire region, the velocity of UAVs, the number of UAVs and the flight duration of UAVs on the delay of SCF mode is analyzed. This paper reveals that the mobility and short flight duration of UAVs have beneficial effects on the performance of UAV networks, which may motivate the study of SCF schemes for UAV networks.	https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8468018	0
Semi-Autonomous Robot Teleoperation With Obstacle Avoidance via Model Predictive Control	This letter proposes a model predictive control approach for semi-autonomous teleoperation of robot manipulators: the focus is on avoiding obstacles with the whole robot frame, while exploiting predictions of the operator's motion. The hand pose of the human operator provides the reference for the end effector, and the robot motion is continuously replanned in real time, satisfying several constraints. An experimental case study is described regarding the design and testing of the described framework on a UR5 manipulator: the experimental results confirm the suitability of the proposed method for semi-autonomous teleoperation, both in terms of performance (tracking capability and constraint satisfaction) and computational complexity (the control law is calculated well within the sampling interval).	https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8718327	0
Localization and Clustering Based on Swarm Intelligence in UAV Networks for Emergency Communications	In recent years, unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) networks have been a focus area of the academic and industrial research community. They have been used in many military and civilian applications. Emergency communication is one of the essential requirements for first responders and victims in the aftermath of natural disasters. In such scenarios, UAVs may configure ad hoc wireless networks to cover a large area. In UAV networks, however, localization and routing are challenging tasks owing to the high mobility, unstable links, dynamic topology, and limited energy of UAVs. Here, we propose swarm-intelligence-based localization (SIL) and clustering schemes in UAV networks for emergency communications. First, we propose a new 3-D SIL algorithm based on particle swarm optimization (PSO) that exploits the particle search space in a limited boundary by using the bounding box method. In the 3-D search space, anchor UAV nodes are randomly distributed and the SIL algorithm measures the distance to existing anchor nodes for estimating the location of the target UAV nodes. Convergence time and localization accuracy are improved with lower computational cost. Second, we propose an energy-efficient swarm-intelligence-based clustering (SIC) algorithm based on PSO, in which the particle fitness function is exploited for intercluster distance, intracluster distance, residual energy, and geographic location. For energy-efficient clustering, cluster heads are selected based on improved particle optimization. The proposed SIC outperforms five typical routing protocols regarding packet delivery ratio, average end-to-end delay, and routing overhead. Moreover, SIC consumes less energy and prolongs network lifetime.	https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8750806	0
Design and Evaluation of UAV Flow Angle Estimation Filters	This paper presents the design, implementation, and evaluation of four filters for the estimation of angle of attack (AOA) and angle of sideslip (AOS) of small unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs). Specifically, two novel filters (a complementary filter and an extended Kalman filter) are proposed and evaluated without using direct flow angle and Global Positioning System measurements; two existing AOA/AOS filters are also implemented and evaluated. All filters are designed with minimal inputs and states to ensure the ease of implementation, simplicity of tuning, and computation efficiency. Both simulation and UAV flight test results show the performance of the proposed filters. Especially, flight test results from two different UAVs (a T-tail UAV and a flying wing UAV) show that the root mean square errors of estimated inertial AOA and AOS are less than 1.5° under nominal flight conditions and around 2° under aggressive maneuvers compared with direct flow angle measurements.	https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8401906	0
Energy Efficient Legitimate Wireless Surveillance of UAV Communications	Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) enhance connectivity and accessibility for civilian and military applications. Criminals or terrorists can potentially use UAVs for committing crimes and terrorism, thus endangering public safety. In this paper, we consider that a legitimate UAV is employed to track flight of suspicious UAVs for preventing safety and security threats. To obtain flight information of the suspicious UAVs, the legitimate UAV intentionally jams the suspicious receiver so as to force the suspicious UAV to reduce its data rate, and hence increase the eavesdropping success. An energy-efficient jamming strategy is proposed for the legitimate UAV to maximize the amount of eavesdropped packets. Moreover, a tracking algorithm is developed for the legitimate UAV to track the suspicious flight by comprehensively utilizing eavesdropped packets, angle-of-arrival and received signal strength of the suspicious transmitter's signal. A new simulation framework is implemented to combine the complementary features of optimization toolbox with channel modeling (in MATLAB) and discrete event-driven mobility tracking (in NS3). Moreover, numerical results validate the proposed algorithms in terms of packet eavesdropping rate and tracking accuracy of the suspicious UAVs' trajectory.	https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8601408	0
Covert Spoofing Algorithm of UAV Based on GPS/INS-Integrated Navigation	A covert spoofing algorithm of an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) based on GPS/inertial-navigation-system-integrated navigation is analyzed in this paper. The proposed algorithm theoretically proves the fact that when the acceleration component of the counterfeit GPS signal is the difference between the UAV's current acceleration and the spoofing control input, the UAV can be covert spoofed. To avoid adverse consequences (detection or crash) caused by frequent changes in UAV flight during the GPS spoofing attacks, the proposed algorithm requires that the deception trajectory planned by the GPS spoofer is slowly changing relative to the reference trajectory, which is pre-set by the UAV. Simulation results have verified the correctness of the proposed covert spoofing algorithm of UAV. Moreover, the spoofing effect is more distinct when the deception trajectory planning is considered.	https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8704896	0
Physical-Layer Security of 5G Wireless Networks for IoT: Challenges and Opportunities	The fifth generation (5G) wireless technologies serve as a key propellent to meet the increasing demands of the future Internet of Things (IoT) networks. For wireless communication security in 5G IoT networks, physical-layer security (PLS) has recently received growing interest. This paper aims to provide a comprehensive survey of the PLS techniques in 5G IoT communication systems. The investigation consists of four hierarchical parts. In the first part, we review the characteristics of 5G IoT under typical application scenarios. We then introduce the security threats from the 5G IoT physical-layer and categorize them according to the different purposes of the attacker. In the third part, we examine the 5G communication technologies in 5G IoT systems and discuss their challenges and opportunities when coping with physical-layer threats, including massive multiple-input-multiple-output (MIMO), millimeter wave (mmWave) communications, nonorthogonal multiple access (NOMA), full-duplex technology, energy harvesting (EH), visible light communication (VLC), and unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) communications. Finally, we discuss open research problems and future works about PLS in the IoT system with technologies of 5G and beyond.	https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8758230	0
Secrecy Performance Analysis of Wireless Communications in the Presence of UAV Jammer and Randomly Located UAV Eavesdroppers	Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) have been undergoing fast development for providing broader signal coverage and more extensive surveillance capabilities in military and civilian applications. Due to the broadcast nature of the wireless signal and the openness of the space, UAV eavesdroppers (UEDs) pose a potential threat to ground communications. In this paper, we consider the communications of a legitimate ground link in the presence of friendly jamming and UEDs within a finite area of space. The spatial distribution of the UEDs obeying a uniform binomial point process (BPP) is used to characterize the randomness of the UEDs. The ground link is assumed to experience log-distance path loss and Rayleigh fading, while free space path loss with/without the averaged excess path loss due to the environment is used for the air-to-ground/air-to-air links. A piecewise function is proposed to approximate the line-of-sight (LoS) probability for the air-to-ground links, which provides a better approximation than using the existing sigmoid-based fitting. The analytical expression for the secure connection probability (SCP) of the legitimate ground link in the presence of non-colluding UEDs is derived. The analysis reveals some useful trends in the SCP as a function of the transmit signal to jamming power ratio, the locations of the UAV jammer, and the height of UAVs.	https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8693785	0
Black Block Recorder: Immutable Black Box Logging for Robots via Blockchain	Event data recording is crucial in robotics research, providing prolonged insights into a robot's situational understanding, progression of behavioral state, and resulting outcomes. Such recordings are invaluable when debugging complex robotic applications or profiling experiments ex post facto. As robotic developments mature into production, both the roles and requirements of event logging will broaden, to include serving as evidence for auditors and regulators investigating accidents or fraud. Given the growing number of high profile public incidents involving self-driving automotives resulting in fatality and regulatory policy making, it is paramount that the integrity, authenticity and non-repudiation of such event logs are maintained to ensure accountability. Being mobile cyber-physical systems, robots present new threats, and vulnerabilities beyond traditional IT: unsupervised physical system access or postmortem collusion between robot and OEM could result in the truncation or alteration of prior records. In this letter, we address immutablization of log records via integrity proofs and distributed ledgers with special considerations for mobile and public service robot deployments.	https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8764004	0
TCALAS: Temporal Credential-Based Anonymous Lightweight Authentication Scheme for Internet of Drones Environment	A user (external party) is interested in accessing the real-time data from some designated drones of a particular fly zone in the Internet of Drones (IoD) deployment. However, to provide this facility, the user needs to be authenticated by an accessed remote drone and vice-versa. After successful authentication both parties can establish a secret session key for the secure communication. To handle this important problem in IoD environment, we design a novel temporal credential based anonymous lightweight user authentication mechanism for IoD environment, called TCALAS. A detailed security analysis using formal security under the broadly applied real-or-random (ROR) model, formal security verification under the broadly used software verification tool, known as automated validation of internet security protocols and applications, and also informal security analysis reveal that TCALAS has the capability to resist various known attacks against passive/active adversary. In addition, a detailed comparative study has been conducted for TCALAS and other related schemes, and the study also reveals that TCALAS provides better security and functionality features, and lower costs in both computation and communication as compared to existing schemes.	https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8693567	0
EKF-Based Visual Inertial Navigation Using Sliding Window Nonlinear Optimization	In this paper, we present a hybrid visual inertial navigation algorithm for an autonomous and intelligent vehicle that combines the multi-state constraint Kalman filter (MSCKF) with the nonlinear visual-inertial graph optimization. The MSCKF is a well-known visual inertial odometry (VIO) method that performs the fusion between an inertial measurement unit (IMU) and the image measurements within a sliding window. The MSCKF computes the re-projection errors from the camera measurements and the states in the sliding window. During this process, the structure-only estimation is performed without exploiting the full information over the window, like the relative interstate motion constraints and their uncertainties. The key contribution of this paper is combination of the filtering and non-linear optimization method for VIO, and the design of a novel measurement model that exploits all of the measurements and information available within the sliding window. The local visual-inertial optimization is performed using pre-integrated IMU measurements and camera measurements. It infers the probabilistically optimal relative pose constraints. These local optimal constraints are used to estimate the global states under the MSCKF framework. The proposed local-optimal-multi-state constraint Kalman filter is validated using a simulation data set, as well as publicly available real-world data sets generated from real-world urban driving experiments.	https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8463496	0
Security Implications of Intentional Capacitive Crosstalk	With advances in shrinking process technology sizes, the parasitic effects of closely routed adjacent wires, crosstalk, still present problems in practice since they directly influence performance and functionality. Even though there is a solid understanding of parasitic effects in hardware designs, the security implications of such undesired effects have been scarcely investigated. In this paper, we leverage the physical routing effects of capacitive crosstalk to demonstrate a new parametric hardware Trojan design methodology. We show that such Trojans can be implemented by only rerouting already existing resources. Thus, our approach possesses a zero-gate area overhead which is both stealthy and challenging to detect with standard visual inspection techniques. In two case studies, we demonstrate its devastating consequences: (1) we realize an implementation attack on a third-party cryptographic AES IP core and (2) we realize a privilege escalation on a general-purpose processor capable of running any modern operating system. In these case studies, we take special care to ensure that the Trojans do not violate design rule checks, which further highlights that the capacitive crosstalk Trojans can be building blocks for malicious circuitry design. We then investigate how state-of-the-art visual inspection techniques can be enhanced to cope with parametric hardware Trojans. In particular, we develop an automated layout-level mitigation approach which exploits the characteristic wire length of capacitive crosstalk Trojans. Finally, we highlight further implementation strategies for capacitive crosstalk Trojans and pinpoint future research directions.	https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8673644	0
Optimal Utility of Vehicles in LTE-V Scenario: An Immune Clone-Based Spectrum Allocation Approach	With the surge service requirements from vehicular users, especially for automated driving, providing real-time high-rate wireless connections to fast-moving vehicles is ever demanding. This motivates the development of the emerging LTE-V network, a 5G cellular-based vehicular technology. However, note that the vehicular user group is typically of a very large scale, whereas the bandwidth spectrum available for vehicular communications is very limited. To efficiently allocate and utilize the slim spectrum resource to vehicle users are therefore important. This paper develops a service priority oriented spectrum allocation scheme in an LTE-V network, which explores the features of vehicular networks toward economic yet QoS guaranteed spectrum allocation. Specifically, the work exploits two features of the vehicular networks. First, vehicles in the proximity typically have similar information requirements, e.g., road conditions. As a result, the location-based multicast (i.e., geocast) could be applied to save the spectrum. Second, different types of vehicles, e.g., ambulances, buses, and private cars, are of different bandwidth and service requirements. Therefore, differential services and spectrum allocations should be applied. By jointly considering the above features, we develop a 2-D service importance oriented framework for LTE-V network spectrum allocations. The spectrum allocation issue is finally modeled as a mixed integer programming problem to maximize the system utility, and solved using an immune clonal based algorithm. The convergence of the proposed algorithm is proved, and using numerical results, we show that our proposal can outperform the typical heuristics-based spectrum resource allocation in terms of convergence and average delay.	https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8421070	0
An Empirical Air-to-Ground Channel Model Based on Passive Measurements in LTE	In this paper, a recently conducted measurement campaign for unmanned-aerial-vehicle channels is introduced. The downlink signals of an in-service long-time-evolution network, which is deployed in a suburban scenario were acquired. Five horizontal and five vertical flight routes were considered. The channel impulse responses (CIRs) are extracted from the received data by exploiting the cell-specific signals, and the underlying physical propagation mechanisms are interpreted by exploiting the propagation graph modeling approach. Based on the CIRs, the parameters of multipath components are estimated by using a high-resolution algorithm derived according to the space-alternating generalized expectation-maximization (SAGE) principle. Based on the SAGE results, channel characteristics including the path loss, shadow fading, fast fading, delay spread, and Doppler frequency spread are thoroughly investigated for different heights and horizontal distances, which constitute a stochastic model.	https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8576578	0
Cognitive Risk Control for Anti-Jamming V2V Communications in Autonomous Vehicle Networks	The future of intelligent transportation system (ITS) is expected to be composed of connected and autonomous vehicles (CAVs), the development of which will have great impact on people's everyday life. Unfortunately, this progress will be accompanied by all kinds of potential threats and attacks rising in CAV network. As a legacy from traditional wireless networks, jamming attack is still one of the major and serious threats to vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) communications. In this paper, we investigate the anti-jamming V2V communication in CAV networks through power control in conjunction with channel selection. Bringing into play a brain-inspired research tool called cognitive dynamic system (CDS), the general structure of cognitive risk control (CRC) is well-tailored to analyze and address the jamming problem. Specifically, power control is carried out first using reinforcement learning, the result of which is then examined by a module called task-switch control. Based on the risk assessment, a multi-armed bandit (MAB) problem is formulated to perform the channel-selection process when necessary. Through continuous perception-action cycles (PACs), the feature of predictive adaptation is realized for the legitimate vehicle in its behavioral interactions with the jammer. Simulation results have shown that the proposed method has desirable performance in terms of several evaluation metrics.	https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8805437	0
A Comparison of Stateless Position-based Packet Routing Algorithms for FANETs	Scalable routing for wireless communication systems is a compelling and challenging task. To this aim, routing algorithms exploiting geographic information have been proposed. These algorithms refer to nodes by their location, rather than their address, and use those coordinates to route greedily towards a destination. With the advent of unmanned airborne vehicle (UAV) technology, a lot of research effort has been devoted to extend position-based packet routing proposals to three dimensional environments. In this context, Flying Ad-hoc Networks (FANETs), comprised of autonomous flying vehicles, pose several issues. This work focuses on the state-of-the-art, stateless geographic packet routing protocols conceived or adapted for three-dimensional network scenarios. Proposals are evaluated over a common scenario through a comprehensive comparative analysis.	https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8305664	0
Asynchronous Stochastic Approximation Based Learning Algorithms for As-You-Go Deployment of Wireless Relay Networks Along a Line	We are motivated by the need, in emergency situations, for impromptu (or “as-you-go”) deployment of multihop wireless networks, by human agents or robots (e.g., unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs)); the agent moves along a line, makes wireless link quality measurements at regular intervals, and makes on-line placement decisions using these measurements. As a first step, we have formulated such deployment along a line as a sequential decision problem. In our earlier work, reported in [1], we proposed two possible deployment approaches: (i) the pure as-you-go approach where the deployment agent can only move forward, and (ii) the explore-forward approach where the deployment agent explores a few successive steps and then selects the best relay placement location among them. The latter was shown to provide better performance (in terms of network cost, network performance, and power expenditure), but at the expense of more measurements and deployment time, which makes explore-forward impractical for quick deployment by an energy constrained agent such as a UAV. Further, since in emergency situations the terrain would be unknown, the deployment algorithm should not require a-priori knowledge of the parameters of the wireless propagation model. In [1], we, therefore, developed learning algorithms for the explore-forward approach. The current paper fills in an important gap by providing deploy-and-learn algorithms for the pure as-you-go approach. We formulate the sequential relay deployment problem as an average cost Markov decision process (MDP), which trades off among power consumption, link outage probabilities, and the number of relay nodes in the deployed network. While the pure as-you-go deployment problem was previously formulated as a discounted cost MDP (see [1]), the discounted cost MDP formulation was not amenable for learning algorithms that are proposed in this paper. In this paper, first we show structural results for the optimal policy corresponding to the average cost MDP, and provide new insights into the optimal policy. Next, by exploiting the special structure of the average cost optimality equation and by using the theory of asynchronous stochastic approximation (in single and two timescale), we develop two learning algorithms that asymptotically converge to the set of optimal policies as deployment progresses. Numerical results show reasonably fast speed of convergence, and hence the model-free algorithms can be useful for practical, fast deployment of emergency wireless networks.	https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8031354	0
How Would Surround Vehicles Move? A Unified Framework for Maneuver Classification and Motion Prediction	Reliable prediction of surround vehicle motion is a critical requirement for path planning for autonomous vehicles. In this paper, we propose a unified framework for surround vehicle maneuver classification and motion prediction that exploits multiple cues, namely, the estimated motion of vehicles, an understanding of typical motion patterns of freeway traffic and intervehicle interaction. We report our results in terms of maneuver classification accuracy and mean and median absolute error of predicted trajectories against the ground truth for real traffic data collected using vehicle mounted sensors on freeways. An ablative analysis is performed to analyze the relative importance of each cue for trajectory prediction. Additionally, an analysis of execution time for the components of the framework is presented. Finally, we present multiple case studies analyzing the outputs of our model for complex traffic scenarios.	https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8286935	0
Secure Message Communication Protocol Among Vehicles in Smart City	Secure messages exchange among different vehicles is one of the most challenging tasks in future smart cities. Any malicious activity has the potential to compromise the confidentiality, integrity, and authenticity of messages exchanged between different vehicles. To ensure secure message communication among the vehicles in a smart city environment, a novel scheme using elliptic curve cryptographic (ECC) technique has been presented in this paper. For this purpose, a two-level authentication key exchange scheme has been designed. In the first level authentication, CH s are verified by series of messages exchanged between CHs and the CA. The verified CHs are responsible for authentication of vehicles in the second level authentication, followed by exchange of messages between CH and vehicle. The security analysis using widely accepted Burrows-Abadi-Needham logic, formal security analysis using random oracle model and verification using the widely known automated validation of Internet security protocols and applications (AVISPA) tool, and also the informal security analysis have been done with respect to various types of attacks. Moreover, a comparative analysis of the proposed scheme with existing related schemes reveals that it generates low overhead and latency, and high reliability during messages exchange between vehicles and the CA.	https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8187745	0
Robust and Efficient Relative Pose With a Multi-Camera System for Autonomous Driving in Highly Dynamic Environments	This paper studies the relative pose problem for autonomous vehicles driving in highly dynamic and possibly cluttered environments. This is a challenging scenario due to the existence of multiple, large, and independently moving objects in the environment, which often leads to an excessive portion of outliers and results in erroneous motion estimation. Existing algorithms cannot cope with such situations well. This paper proposes a new algorithm for relative pose estimation using a multi-camera system with multiple non-overlapping cameras. The method works robustly even when the number of outliers is overwhelming. By exploiting specific prior knowledge of the autonomous driving scene, we have developed an efficient 4-point algorithm for multi-camera relative pose estimation, which admits analytic solutions by solving a polynomial root finding equation, and runs extremely fast (at about 0.5 μs per root). When the solver is used in combination with a new random sample consensus sampling scheme by exploiting the conjugate motion constraint, we are able to quickly prune unpromising hypotheses and significantly improve the chance of finding inliers. Experiments on synthetic data have validated the performance of the proposed algorithm. Tests on real data further confirm the method's practical relevance.	https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8053815	0
Consumer Drones Targeting by Sodar (Acoustic Radar)	Consumer drones have recently become a threat in many real scenarios, since they are difficult to detect and track, and can be easily used to perform criminal activities such as smuggling of illicit materials, surveillance operations or network hacking, and stealing data. Existing technologies are either not suitable to detect an object that can be as small as 10 cm, or quite expensive and complicated to deploy. We carried out a field experiment to explore the possibility of tuning a well-known, low-cost acoustic radar (sodar), commonly used in atmospheric physics, to detect and track consumer drones. The vertical position of a small drone retrieved by a single-sodar antenna turned out to be in good agreement with that measured by its onboard GPS (correlation coefficient 0.93), and no significant bias was observed. Despite being preliminary, these results support the use of such a technique to retrieve reliably the position of small unmanned aerial vehicles.	https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8430530	0
Self-Localization Based on Visual Lane Marking Maps: An Accurate Low-Cost Approach for Autonomous Driving	Autonomous driving in public roads requires precise localization within the range of few centimeters. Even the best localization systems based on GNSS cannot always reach this level of precision, especially in an urban environment, where the signal is disturbed by surrounding buildings and artifacts. Recent works have shown the advantage of using maps as a precise, robust, and reliable way of localization. Typical approaches use the set of current readings from the vehicle sensors to estimate its position on the map. The approach presented in this paper exploits a short-range visual lane marking detector and a dead reckoning system to construct a registry of the detected back lane markings corresponding to the last 240 m driven. This information is used to search in the map the most similar section, to determine the vehicle localization in the map reference. Additional filtering is used to obtain a more robust estimation for the localization. The accuracy obtained is sufficiently high to allow autonomous driving in a narrow road. The system uses a low-cost architecture of sensors and the algorithm is light enough to run on low-power embedded architecture.	https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8063437	0
A Hierarchical Detection and Response System to Enhance Security Against Lethal Cyber-Attacks in UAV Networks	Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) networks have not yet received considerable research attention. Specifically, security issues are a major concern because such networks, which carry vital information, are prone to various attacks. In this paper, we design and implement a novel intrusion detection and response scheme, which operates at the UAV and ground station levels, to detect malicious anomalies that threaten the network. In this scheme, a set of detection and response techniques are proposed to monitor the UAV behaviors and categorize them into the appropriate list (normal, abnormal, suspect, and malicious) according to the detected cyber-attack. We focus on the most lethal cyber-attacks that can target an UAV network, namely, false information dissemination, GPS spoofing, jamming, and black hole and gray hole attacks. Extensive simulations confirm that the proposed scheme performs well in terms of attack detection even with a large number of UAVs and attackers since it exhibits a high detection rate, a low number of false positives, and prompt detection with a low communication overhead.	https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7890467	0
Multiantenna GNSS and Inertial Sensors/Odometer Coupling for Robust Vehicular Navigation	Location information is one of the most vital information required to achieve intelligence and context-awareness for Internet of Things applications such as driverless cars. However, related security and privacy threats are a major holdback. With increasing focus on the use global navigation satellite system (GNSS) for autonomous navigation and related applications, it is important to provide robust navigation solutions. Radio frequency interference, either intentional or unintentional, has a direct impact on GNSS navigation performance related to observability and accuracy. In terms of security, spoofing is the major issue of concern. This paper focuses on multiantenna GNSS and inertial navigation system (INS)-odometer integration to improve robustness, security, and privacy of navigation solutions. Multiantenna GNSS provides robustness against different interference sources and integration with INS provides continuous navigation solutions during short-term signal outages. Performance of the proposed architecture is evaluated using different user scenarios in the presence of spoofing and interference signals in real vehicular environments.	https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8329988	0
Combating the Control Signal Spoofing Attack in UAV Systems	Unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) system is vulnerable to the control signal spoofing attack due to the openness of the wireless communications. In this correspondence, a physical layer approach is proposed to combat the control signal spoofing attack, i.e., to determine whether the received control signal packet is from the ground control station or a potential malicious attacker (MA), which does not need to share any secret key. We consider the worst case where the UAV does not have any prior knowledge about the MA. Utilizing the channel feature of the angles of arrival, the distance-based path loss, and the Rician-$\kappa$ factor, we construct a generalized log-likelihood radio test framework to handle the problem. Accurate approximations of the false alarm and successful detection rate are provided to efficiently evaluate the performance.	https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8350330	0
Weapon configuration, allocation and route planning with time windows for multiple unmanned combat air vehicles	Unmanned combat air vehicles (UCAVs) mission planning is a fairly complicated global optimum problem. Military attack missions often employ a fleet of UCAVs equipped with weapons to attack a set of known targets. A UCAV can carry different weapons to accomplish different combat missions. Choice of different weapons will have different effects on the final combat effectiveness. This work presents a mixed integer programming model for simultaneous weapon configuration and route planning of UCAVs, which solves the problem optimally using the IBM ILOG CPLEX optimizer for simple missions. This paper develops a heuristic algorithm to handle the medium-scale and large-scale problems. The experiments demonstrate the performance of the heuristic algorithm in solving the medium scale and large scale problems. Moreover, we give suggestions on how to select the most appropriate algorithm to solve different scale problems.	https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8536780	0
Collision-Aware Resource Access Scheme for LTE-Based Machine-to-Machine Communications	Long-term evolution (LTE) network is considered as the most promising infrastructure to provide efficient connectivity for a large number of autonomous machine-type communications devices (MTCDs). In order to improve the random access (RA) throughput of massive access machine-to-machine (M2M) communications over LTE networks, we propose a collision-aware resource access (CARA) scheme to reduce the collisions on the granted physical resource blocks (PRBs). In CARA, the evolved Node B exploits early collision detection of preambles at the first message and informs the MTCDs in the corresponding random access response (RAR) message if it can detect the collision successfully. The collided MTCDs then contend for PRBs access using an appropriate probability for efficient use of granted PRBs. Analytical and numerical performance evaluations of the CARA show that the RA throughput can be improved in comparison with the traditional RA procedure.	https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8255659	0
A Dynamical-System-Based Approach for Controlling Robotic Manipulators During Noncontact/Contact Transitions	Many daily life tasks require precise control when making contact with surfaces. Ensuring a smooth transition from free motion to contact is crucial as incurring a large impact force may lead to unstable contact with the robot bouncing on the surface, i.e., chattering. Stabilizing the forces at contact is not possible as the impact lasts for less than a millisecond, leaving no time for the robot to react to the impact force. We present a strategy in which the robot adapts its dynamic before entering into contact. The speed is modulated so as to align with the surface. We leverage the properties of autonomous dynamical systems for immediate replanning and handling unforeseen perturbations and exploit local modulations of the dynamics to control for the smooth transitions at contact. We show theoretically and empirically that by using the modulation framework, the robot can stably touch the contact surface, even when the surface's location is uncertain, at a desired location, and finally, leave the surface or stop on the surface at a desired point.	https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8354896	0
An Adaptive Spacing Policy Guaranteeing String Stability in Multi-Brand Ad Hoc Platoons	A method is presented for the longitudinal control of autonomous vehicles forming a multi-brand, ad hoc platoon. A leader and predecessor following (LPF) control architecture is known to allow string stable platooning with shorter safety gaps between vehicles as compared with predecessor following schemes. General LPF strategies, however, require the exact knowledge of spacing policies of predecessor vehicles for correctly specifying a spacing with respect to the leader. It follows that arbitrary spacing policies in ad hoc platoons prevent the applicability of classical LPF control structures. It is shown in this paper that it is possible to exploit the advantages of LPF architectures in multi-brand platoons without a priori knowledge of spacing policies of predecessors. The unknown spacing policies are replaced by a virtual one, which serves as an input to a two degree of freedom LPF controller. The resulting control structure enables the organization of ad hoc platoons consisting of vehicles with different spacing policies. Computer simulations are presented to illustrate the statements.	https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8053789	0
AC-POCA: Anticoordination Game Based Partially Overlapping Channels Assignment in Combined UAV and D2D-Based Networks	Device-to-device (D2D)-enabled wireless networks are becoming increasingly popular. However, in remote, rural, and disaster affected areas, it is difficult to construct such wireless networks due to the unavailability or inadequacy of cellular infrastructures. Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) can be a good candidate to promptly construct the D2D-enabled wireless network. However, the assignment of the radio channels of the nodes (i.e., UAVs and user terminals) is challenging due to the availability of only a limited number of orthogonal channels and the interference issue resulted from using arbitrary channels. Furthermore, the dynamic topology and high mobility of nodes in such a combined UAV and D2D-based network make conventional channel assignment (CA) algorithm no longer suitable. In this paper, we formally address this problem, and demonstrate how partially overlapping channels (POCs) and game theory can be exploited to alleviate the problem. In this vein, we propose a distributed anticoordination game based POC assignment algorithm referred to as AC-POCA. In our proposed AC-POCA, the nodes use only local information to play the game, and reach a steady state, uniqueness of which is verified through analysis. Also, the upper bound of AC-POCA (i.e., price of anarchy) is analytically evaluated, which is corroborated by simulation results. In addition, simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness of AC-POCA in terms of good throughput and low signaling overhead in a dynamic environment.	https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8039268	0
Robust Trajectory and Transmit Power Design for Secure UAV Communications	Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) are anticipated to be widely deployed in future wireless communications, due to their advantages of high mobility and easy deployment. However, the broadcast nature of airto-ground line-of-sight wireless channels brings a new challenge to the information security of UAV-ground communication. This paper tackles such a challenge in the physical layer by exploiting the mobility of UAV via its trajectory design. We consider a UAV-ground communication system with multiple potential eavesdroppers on the ground, where the information on the locations of the eavesdroppers is imperfect. We formulate an optimization problem, which maximizes the average worst case secrecy rate of the system by jointly designing the robust trajectory and transmit power of the UAV over a given flight duration. The nonconvexity of the optimization problem and the imperfect location information of the eavesdroppers make the problem difficult to be solved optimally. We propose an iterative suboptimal algorithm to solve this problem efficiently by applying the block coordinate descent method, S-procedure, and successive convex optimization method. Simulation results show that the proposed algorithm can improve the average worst case secrecy rate significantly, as compared to two other benchmark algorithms without robust design.	https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8392472	0
Robust Long-Term Registration of UAV Images of Crop Fields for Precision Agriculture	Continuous crop monitoring is an important aspect of precision agriculture and requires the registration of sensor data over longer periods of time. Often, fields are monitored using cameras mounted on unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) but strong changes in the visual appearance of the growing crops and the field itself poses serious challenges to conventional image registration methods. In this letter, we present a method for registering images of agricultural fields taken by an UAV over the crop season and present a complete pipeline for computing temporally aligned three-dimensional (3-D) point clouds of the field. Our approach exploits the inherent geometry of the crop arrangement in the field, which remains mostly static over time. This allows us to register the images even in the presence of strong visual changes. To this end, we propose a scale invariant, geometric feature descriptor that encodes the local plant arrangement geometry. The experiments suggest that we are able to register images taken over the crop season, including situations where matching with an off-the-shelf visual descriptor fails. We evaluate the accuracy of our matching system with respect to manually labeled ground truth. We furthermore illustrate that the reconstructed 3-D models are qualitatively correct and the registration results allow for monitoring growth parameters at a per plant level.	https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8392366	0
Guest Editorial Special Section on Recent Trends and Developments in Industry 4.0 Motivated Robotic Solutions	The twelve papers in this special section focus on the development of robotic solutions for smart factories in industry - the concept of the fourth industrial revolution (industry 4.0). The inclusion of robotics is expected to deeply change the future manufacturing and production processes, and lead to smart factories that will benefit from the main design principles of Industry 4.0: interoperability, virtualization, decentralization, real-time capability, service orientation, and modularity. Robotics will have a key role in this development since innovative technologies and solutions, traditionally associated with the service robotics sector, are going to migrate to industrial smarter robots, exploiting the maturing of navigation, localization, sensing, and motion control technologies. These smarter robots will draw on a much broader range of technology, allowing higher levels of dexterity and flexibility, the ability to learn tasks without formal programming, and to autonomously collaborate with other autonomous devices and human operators.	https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8331177	0
Curb Detection for Road and Sidewalk Detection	Curb detection, a significant area of autonomous driving, plays an important role in road detection and obstacle avoidance, etc. However, curb detection is challenging due to the problems like occlusions, shadows and the small size of the target. In this paper, we propose a curb detection paradigm for road and sidewalk detection for mobile robots using stereo vision in the urban residential region. First, the flat area is estimated based on the disparity and v-disparity maps generated from stereo matching. In the estimated flat area, to distinguish curbs from the road and obstacles, we propose an efficient 16-dimensional descriptor based on the appearance, geometry, and disparity characteristics of curbs. The curb points can be extracted by an SVM classifier with the obtained descriptors. Second, the curb points are exploited by a vanishing point constrained Dijkstra road model to find the road region, where two shortest paths, generated from the vanishing point to the last row of the cost map, are searched and regarded as the road borders. Following the curb and road region detection results, the sidewalk area is detected by a region-growing-like method based on the geometry characteristic of the sidewalk area and the layout of road scenes. The proposed method has been tested for road and sidewalk detection tasks on the KITTI dataset. The experimental results of the curb, road, and sidewalk detection demonstrate the accuracy and robustness of this method.	https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8438883	0
Spline-Based Motion Planning for Autonomous Guided Vehicles in a Dynamic Environment	Autonomous vehicles require a collision-free motion trajectory at every time instant. This brief presents an optimization-based method to calculate such trajectories for autonomous vehicles operating in an uncertain environment with moving obstacles. The proposed approach applies to linear system models, as well as to a particular class of nonlinear models, including industrially relevant vehicles, such as autonomous guided vehicles with front wheel, differential wheel, and rear-wheel steering. The method computes smooth motion trajectories, satisfying the vehicle's kinematics, by using a spline parameterization. Furthermore, it exploits spline properties to keep the resulting nonlinear optimization problem small scale and to guarantee constraint satisfaction, without the need for time gridding. The resulting problem is solved sufficiently fast for online motion planning, dealing with uncertainties and changes in the environment. This brief demonstrates the potential of the method with extensive numerical simulations. In addition, it presents an experimental validation in which a KUKA youBot, steered as a holonomic or differential drive vehicle, drives through an environment with moving obstacles. To facilitate the further development and the numerical and experimental validation of the presented method, it is embodied in a user-friendly open-source software toolbox.	https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8022960	0
A Real-Time Battery Thermal Management Strategy for Connected and Automated Hybrid Electric Vehicles (CAHEVs) Based on Iterative Dynamic Programming	Connected and automated hybrid electric vehicles (CAHEVs) are a potential solution to the future transportation due to their improved fuel economy, reduced emissions, and capability to mitigate congestion and improve safety. The battery thermal management (BTM) in CAHEVs is one of the crucial problems, because the lithium-ion batteries are highly temperature sensitive. Therefore, a practical and energy-efficient BTM strategy is required for both improving the operating temperature of batteries and saving energy. In this study, the dynamic programming (DP) is implemented for a BTM system in CAHEVs for achieving the optimal cooling/heating energy savings for batteries. To enhance the real-time capability, an iterative approach is proposed to approximate the optimum control strategy iteratively in a multidimensional search space. The proposed iterative DP strategy can improve the system performance and energy-efficiency by fully exploiting the future road information in CAHEVs combined with a model predictive control method. The hardware-in-the-loop validation of the proposed strategy is conducted on the UDDS and the WLTC drive cycles based on a Toyota Prius PHEV model. The results demonstrate the feasibility and effectiveness of the proposed BTM strategy that leads to a considerable BTM energy reduction.	https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8373733	0
A Soft Aquatic Actuator for Unsteady Peak Power Amplification	A soft hydraulic actuator is presented which uses elastic energy storage for the purpose of pulsed-jet propulsion of soft unmanned underwater vehicles. The actuator consists of a flexible membrane that can be inflated using a micropump and whose elastic potential energy may be released on demand using a controllable valve, in a manner inspired by the swimming of squids and octopuses. It is shown that for equivalent initial elastic energy, the drop in peak thrust is linearly proportional to the decrease in nozzle cross section. Peak hydraulic power amplification of the soft actuator of approximately 75% is achieved with respect to that of the driving pump, confirming that passive elasticity can be exploited in aquatic propulsion to replicate the explosive motion skills of agile sea-dwelling creatures.	https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8477111	0
User-Centric View of Unmanned Aerial Vehicle Transmission Against Smart Attacks	Unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) systems are vulnerable to smart attackers, who are selfish and subjective end-users and use smart radio devices to change their attack types and policies based on the ongoing UAV transmission and network states. In this paper, we apply prospect theory to formulate a subjective smart attack game for the UAV transmission, in which a smart attacker Eve makes subjective decisions to choose the attack type such as jamming, spoofing, and eavesdropping without knowing the attack detection accuracy of the UAV system, and the UAV transmit power on multiple radio channels is chosen to resist smart attacks. Reinforcement-learning-based UAV power allocation strategies are proposed to achieve the optimal power allocation against smart attacks without knowing the attack model and the channel model in the dynamic game. A deep Q-learning-based UAV power allocation strategy combines Q-learning and deep learning to accelerate the learning speed for the case with a large number of channel states and attack modes. Simulation results show that our proposed UAV power allocation strategy can suppress the attack motivation of subjective smart attackers and increase the secrecy capacity and the utility of the UAV system.	https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8231220	0
Hierarchical Control Design for a Shipboard Power System With DC Distribution and Energy Storage Aboard Future More-Electric Ships	DC distribution is now becoming the major trend of future mobile power systems, such as more-electric aircrafts and ships. As dc distribution has different nature to the conventional ac system, a new design of well-structured control and management methods will be mandatory. In this paper, a shipboard power system with dc distribution and energy storage system (ESS) is picked as the study case. To meet the requirement of control and management of such a large-scale mobile power system, a hierarchical control design is proposed in this paper. In order to fully exploit the benefit of the ESS, as well as to overcome the limitation in controllability, a novel inverse-droop control method is proposed, in which the power sharing is according to the source characteristic, instead of their power rating. A frequency-division method is also proposed as an extension to the inverse-droop method for enabling a hybrid ESS and its autonomous operation. On the basis of the proposed methods, the control methods for management and voltage restoration levels are also proposed to establish a comprehensive control solution. Real-time simulations are carried out to validate the performance of the proposed control design under different operating conditions. When compared to more conventional droop-based approaches, the new proposal shows enhancement in efficiency.	https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8103775	0
Drone Pilot Identification by Classifying Radio-Control Signals	Analysis of interactions with remotely controlled devices has been used to detect the onset of hijacking attacks, as well as for forensics analysis, e.g., to identify the human controller. Its effectiveness is known to depend on the remote device type as well as on the properties of the remote control signal. This paper shows that the radio control signal sent to an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) using a typical transmitter can be captured and analyzed to identify the controlling pilot using machine learning techniques. Twenty trained pilots have been asked to fly a high-end research drone through three different trajectories. Control data have been collected and used to train multiple classifiers. Best performance has been achieved by a random forest classifier that achieved accuracy around 90% using simple time-domain features. Extensive tests have shown that the classification accuracy depends on the flight trajectory and that the pitch, roll, yaw, and thrust control signals show different levels of significance for pilot identification. This result paves the way to a number of security and forensics applications, including continuous identification of UAV pilots to mitigate the risk of hijacking.	https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8323415	0
Capacity Analysis of UAV Communications: Cases of Random Trajectories	This paper analyzes the link capacity between autonomous unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) with random three-dimensional (3-D) trajectories. This is distinctively different from existing works typically under the assumption of either two-dimensional (2-D) or deterministic trajectories, and particularly interesting to applications such as surveillance and air combat. The key idea is that we geometrically derive the probability distributions of the UAV-to-UAV (U2U) distances which, by exploiting the Jensen's inequality, can be translated to the closed-form bounds for the capacity between UAVs, and between UAVs and ground stations. Another important aspect is that we extrapolate the idea to dense UAV networks, and analyze the impact of network densification, imperfect channel state information, and interference from ground transmitters on the capacity. Corroborated by simulations, our analysis shows that a U2U link with random 2-D trajectories is superior in terms of capacity due to its short average link distance. It is also revealed that a UAV-to-ground link can incur substantially lower capacity than a U2U link even in the case the 3-D coverage of the UAVs is the same, as the result of its longer average link length.	https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8345703	0
Fast Genetic Algorithm Path Planner for Fixed-Wing Military UAV Using GPU	Military unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) are employed in highly dynamic environments and must often adjust their trajectories based on the evolving situation. To operate autonomously and safely, a UAV must be equipped with a path planning module capable of quickly recalculating a feasible and quasi-optimal path in flight while in the event a new obstacle or threat has been detected or simply if the destination point is changed during the mission. To allow for a fast path planning, this paper proposes a parallel implementation of the genetic algorithm on graphics processing unit (GPU). The trajectories are built as series of line segments connected by circular arcs resulting in smooth paths suitable for fixed-wing UAVs. The fitness function we defined takes into account the dynamic constraints of the UAVs and aims to minimize fuel consumption and average flying altitude in order to improve range and avoid detection by enemy radars. This fitness function is also implemented on the GPU and different parallelization strategies were developed and tested for each step of the fitness evaluation. By exploiting the massively parallel architecture of GPUs, the execution time of the proposed path planner was reduced by a factor of 290x compared to a sequential execution on CPU. The path planning module developed was tested using 18 scenarios on six realistic three-dimensional terrains with multiple no-fly zones. We found that the proposed GPU-based path planner was able to find quasi-optimal solutions in a timely fashion allowing in-flight planning.	https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8294239	0
Vehicle Positioning in GNSS-Deprived Urban Areas by Stereo Visual-Inertial Odometry	Accurate and continuous positioning in global navigation satellite system (GNSS) deprived urban areas is crucial for autonomous vehicles and mobile mapping systems. To achieve this goal, we propose a stereo visual-inertial odometry approach using a multistate constraint Kalman filter (MSCKF). In contrast with the conventional MSCKF, in which an inertial navigation system (INS) propagates the vehicle motion, and then the propagation is corrected by measurements of salient features extracted from images of a single camera, we update the propagation with observations extracted from images of a stereo pair of cameras. This way, additional constraints across the stereo pairs of images are exploited to improve the pose estimation. Experimental results on several KITTI datasets show that the stereo MSCKF outperforms the mono one achieving an average positioning error of 0.9% of the trajectory length compared to 1.3% for the mono approach and 2.5% for INS-only integration. These results show that visual-inertial odometry has a promising potential for vehicle positioning in short periods of GNSS signal outage.	https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8286957	0
Long Short-Term Memory Networks for Accurate State-of-Charge Estimation of Li-ion Batteries	State of charge (SOC) estimation is critical to the safe and reliable operation of Li-ion battery packs, which nowadays are becoming increasingly used in electric vehicles (EVs), Hybrid EVs, unmanned aerial vehicles, and smart grid systems. We introduce a new method to perform accurate SOC estimation for Li-ion batteries using a recurrent neural network (RNN) with long short-term memory (LSTM). We showcase the LSTM-RNN's ability to encode dependencies in time and accurately estimate SOC without using any battery models, filters, or inference systems like Kalman filters. In addition, this machine-learning technique, like all others, is capable of generalizing the abstractions it learns during training to other datasets taken under different conditions. Therefore, we exploit this feature by training an LSTM-RNN model over datasets recorded at various ambient temperatures, leading to a single network that can properly estimate SOC at different ambient temperature conditions. The LSTM-RNN achieves a low mean absolute error (MAE) of 0.573% at a fixed ambient temperature and an MAE of 1.606% on a dataset with ambient temperature increasing from 10 to 25 °C.	https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8240689	0
WaterGAN: Unsupervised Generative Network to Enable Real-Time Color Correction of Monocular Underwater Images	This letter reports on WaterGAN, a generative adversarial network (GAN) for generating realistic underwater images from in-air image and depth pairings in an unsupervised pipeline used for color correction of monocular underwater images. Cameras onboard autonomous and remotely operated vehicles can capture high-resolution images to map the seafloor; however, underwater image formation is subject to the complex process of light propagation through the water column. The raw images retrieved are characteristically different than images taken in air due to effects, such as absorption and scattering, which cause attenuation of light at different rates for different wavelengths. While this physical process is well described theoretically, the model depends on many parameters intrinsic to the water column as well as the structure of the scene. These factors make recovery of these parameters difficult without simplifying assumptions or field calibration; hence, restoration of underwater images is a nontrivial problem. Deep learning has demonstrated great success in modeling complex nonlinear systems but requires a large amount of training data, which is difficult to compile in deep sea environments. Using WaterGAN, we generate a large training dataset of corresponding depth, in-air color images, and realistic underwater images. These data serve as input to a two-stage network for color correction of monocular underwater images. Our proposed pipeline is validated with testing on real data collected from both a pure water test tank and from underwater surveys collected in the field. Source code, sample datasets, and pretrained models are made publicly available.	https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7995024	0
Learning to Detect Aircraft for Long-Range Vision-Based Sense-and-Avoid Systems	The commercial use of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) would be enhanced by an ability to sense and avoid potential mid-air collision threats. In this letter, we propose a new approach to aircraft detection for long-range vision-based sense and avoid. We first train a deep convolutional neural network to learn aircraft visual features using flight data of mid-air head-on near-collision course encounters between two fixed-wing aircraft. We then propose an approach that fuses these learnt aircraft features with hand-crafted features that are used by the current state of the art. Finally, we evaluate the performance of our proposed approach on real flight data captured from a UAV, where it achieves a mean detection range of 2527 m and a mean detection range improvement of 299 m (or 13.4%) compared to the current state of the art with no additional false alarms.	https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8447264	0
Multilabel Conditional Random Field Classification for UAV Images	In this letter, we formulate the multilabeling classification problem of unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) imagery within a conditional random field (CRF) framework with the aim of exploiting simultaneously spatial contextual information and cross-correlation between labels. The pipeline of the framework consists of two main phases. First, the considered input UAV image is subdivided into a grid of tiles, which are processed thanks to an opportune representation and a multilayer perceptron classifier providing thus tile-wise multilabel prediction probabilities. In the second phase, a multilabel CRF model is applied to integrate spatial correlation between adjacent tiles and the correlation between labels within the same tile, with the objective to improve iteratively the multilabel classification map associated with the considered input UAV image. Experimental results achieved on two different UAV image data sets are reported and discussed.	https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8267483	0
Urban Traffic Density Estimation Based on Ultrahigh-Resolution UAV Video and Deep Neural Network	This paper presents an advanced urban traffic density estimation solution using the latest deep learning techniques to intelligently process ultrahigh-resolution traffic videos taken from an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV). We first capture nearly an hour-long ultrahigh-resolution traffic video at five busy road intersections of a modern megacity by flying a UAV during the rush hours. We then randomly sampled over 17 K 512×512 pixel image patches from the video frames and manually annotated over 64 K vehicles to form a dataset for this paper, which will also be made available to the research community for research purposes. Our innovative urban traffics analysis solution consists of an advanced deep neural network (DNN) based vehicle detection and localization, type (car, bus, and truck) recognition, tracking, and vehicle counting over time. We will present extensive experimental results to demonstrate the effectiveness of our solution. We will show that our enhanced single shot multibox detector (Enhanced-SSD) outperforms other DNN-based techniques and that deep learning techniques are more effective than traditional computer vision techniques in traffic video analysis. We will also show that ultrahigh-resolution video provides more information that enables more accurate vehicle detection and recognition than lower resolution contents. This paper not only demonstrates the advantages of using the latest technological advancements (ultrahigh-resolution video and UAV), but also provides an advanced DNN-based solution for exploiting these technological advancements for urban traffic density estimation.	https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8536405	0
IEEE 802.11p and Visible Light Hybrid Communication Based Secure Autonomous Platoon	Autonomous vehicle platoon is an enhancement of autonomous behavior, where vehicles are organized into groups of close proximity through wireless communication. Platoon members mostly communicate with each other via the current dominant vehicular radio frequency (RF) technology, IEEE 802.11p. However, this technology leads security vulnerabilities under various attacks from adversaries. Visible light communication (VLC) has the potential to alleviate these vulnerabilities by exploiting the directivity and impermeability of light. Utilizing only VLC in vehicle platoon, on the other hand, may degrade platoon stability since VLC is sensitive to environmental effects. In this paper, we propose an IEEE 802.11p and VLC-based hybrid security protocol for platoon communication, namely SP-VLC, with the goal of ensuring platoon stability and securing platoon maneuvers under data packet injection, channel overhearing, jamming, and platoon maneuver attacks. We define platoon maneuver attack based on the identification of various scenarios where a fake maneuver packet is transmitted by a malicious actor. SP-VLC includes mechanisms for the secret key establishment, message authentication, data transmission over both IEEE 802.11p and VLC,jamming detection and reaction to switch to VLC only communication and secure platoon maneuvering based on the joint usage of IEEE 802.11p and VLC. We develop a simulation platform combining realistic vehicle mobility model, realistic VLC and IEEE 802.11p channel models, and vehicle platoon management. We show the functionality of the SP-VLC protocol under all possible security attacks by performing extensive simulations. Ourfindings demonstrate that SPVLC protocol generates less than 0.1% difference in the speed of and distance between platoon members during security attacks in comparison to 25% and 10% in that of previously proposed IEEE 802.11p and IEEE 802.11p-VLC hybrid protocols, respectively.	https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8365848	0
Obstacle avoidance method of three-dimensional obstacle spherical cap	Focusing on obstacle avoidance in three-dimensional space for unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV), the direct obstacle avoidance method in dynamic space based on three-dimensional velocity obstacle spherical cap is proposed, which quantifies the influence of threatening obstacles through velocity obstacle spherical cap parameters. In addition, the obstacle avoidance schemes of any point on the critical curve during the multi-obstacles avoidance are given. Through prediction, the insertion point for the obstacle avoidance can be obtained and the flight path can be re-planned. Taking the Pythagorean Hodograph (PH) curve trajectory re-planning as an example, the three-dimensional direct obstacle avoidance method in dynamic space is tested. Simulation results show that the proposed method can realize the online obstacle avoidance trajectory re-planning, which increases the flexibility of obstacle avoidance greatly.	https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8536788	0
Secure Automated Valet Parking: A Privacy-Preserving Reservation Scheme for Autonomous Vehicles	It is believed that automated valet parking (AVP) system has great potential to mitigate the parking headache for the future smart city, as it can provide on-demand parking services, bringing immense benefits from energy saving for vehicles to time saving for drivers. For an AVP system, parking reservation is an indispensable part so that vehicles can accomplish automated parking in accordance with the reserved parking information. However, the reservation requests may not only reveal the driver identity, but also disclose his/her sensitive locations, e.g., the most visited places, which are of great concerns to users. To deal with this challenge, the anonymous techniques can be naturally applied during parking reservation, but directly applying the anonymous techniques in AVP will introduce a new security issue, i.e., the anonymous user may maliciously crash the AVP system by repetitively sending the reservation requests, which is called “double-reservation attack.” In this paper, we propose a new privacy-preserving reservation scheme for securing AVP system. Specifically, each anonymous user must have only one valid reservation token at any moment, and the token can only be used for booking one vacant parking space once. The proposed scheme does not only preserve the user's identity privacy and location privacy but also prevents the “double-reservation attack” based on several elegant building blocks, i.e., zero-knowledge proofs of knowledge and proxy resignature. Detailed security analysis confirms the security properties of our proposed scheme. In addition, extensive simulations are conducted to compare our proposed scheme with three previous schemes, and the experiment results demonstrate that our scheme is also much efficient in a WiFi-based testbed.	https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8464286	0
A Point-to-Ray Framework for Generating Smooth Parallel Parking Maneuvers	The problem of generating smooth parallel parking maneuver for autonomous car-like vehicles is considered, wherein the vehicle moves forward from the starting point to an intermediate point and then traces a path backward to the parking position. Any error in accurately reaching the intermediate point leads to maneuver replanning and hence puts extra computational burden on the planner. Addressing the issue, this letter formulates the problem in a point-to-ray framework connecting the parking position to all points in a neighborhood of the intermediate point. Exploiting its asymptotic convergence, four parameter logistic (4PL) curve based S-shaped path is proposed as a solution with a single maneuver connecting the intermediate point neighborhood to the parking position. Inherent to the 4PL curve, the maneuver presents a continuous steering profile with zero steering angle at the ends. Parking slot collision avoidance and steering limit of the vehicle are satisfied by deducing closed-form analytic conditions on the two design parameters. Together with the robustness to intermediate point variation, comparison with existing approaches highlights computational and design advantages. The proposed approach is validated using a double-tracked Ackermann steering vehicle model.	https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8264750	0
Context-Based Filtering of Noisy Labels for Automatic Basemap Updating From UAV Data	Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) have the potential to obtain high-resolution aerial imagery at frequent intervals, making them a valuable tool for urban planners who require up-to-date basemaps. Supervised classification methods can be exploited to translate the UAV data into such basemaps. However, these methods require labeled training samples, the collection of which may be complex and time consuming. Existing spatial datasets can be exploited to provide the training labels, but these often contain errors due to differences in the date or resolution of the dataset from which these outdated labels were obtained. In this paper, we propose an approach for updating basemaps using global and local contextual cues to automatically remove unreliable samples from the training set, and thereby, improve the classification accuracy. Using UAV datasets over Kigali, Rwanda, and Dar es Salaam, Tanzania, we demonstrate how the amount of mislabeled training samples can be reduced by 44.1% and 35.5%, respectively, leading to a classification accuracy of 92.1% in Kigali and 91.3% in Dar es Salaam. To achieve the same accuracy in Dar es Salaam, between 50000 and 60000 manually labeled image segments would be needed. This demonstrates that the proposed approach of using outdated spatial data to provide labels and iteratively removing unreliable samples is a viable method for obtaining high classification accuracies while reducing the costly step of acquiring labeled training samples.	https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8103751	0
UAV Relay in VANETs Against Smart Jamming With Reinforcement Learning	Frequency hopping-based antijamming techniques are not always applicable in vehicular ad hoc networks (VANETs) due to the high mobility of onboard units (OBUs) and the large-scale network topology. In this paper, we use unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) to relay the message of an OBU and improve the communication performance of VANETs against smart jammers that observe the ongoing OBU and UAV communication status and even induce the UAV to use a specific relay strategy and then attack it accordingly. More specifically, the UAV relays the OBU message to another roadside unit (RSU) with a better radio transmission condition if the serving RSU is heavily jammed or interfered. The interactions between a UAV and a smart jammer are formulated as an antijamming UAV relay game, in which the UAV decides whether or not to relay the OBU message to another RSU, and the jammer observes the UAV and the VANET strategy and chooses the jamming power accordingly. The Nash equilibria of the UAV relay game are derived to reveal how the optimal UAV relay strategy depends on the transmit cost and the UAV channel model. A hotbooting policy hill climbing-based UAV relay strategy is proposed to help the VANET resist jamming in the dynamic game without being aware of the VANET model and the jamming model. Simulation results show that the proposed relay strategy can efficiently reduce the bit error rate of the OBU message and thus increase the utility of the VANET compared with a Q-learning-based scheme.	https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8246580	0
Detection and Recognition of Traffic Planar Objects Using Colorized Laser Scan and Perspective Distortion Rectification	Reliable detection and recognition of planar objects including traffic sign, street sign, and road surface in dynamic cluttered natural scenes are a big challenge for self-driving cars. In this paper, we propose a comprehensive method for planar object detection and recognition. First, the data association of LIDAR and camera is set up to acquire colorized laser scans, which simultaneously contain both color and geometrical information. Second, we combine three color spaces of RGB, HSV, and CIE L*a*b* with laser reflectivity as an aggregation-based feature vector. Third, the 3-D geometrical characteristics of planar objects that contain planarity, size, and aspect ratio are exploited to further reduce false alarm. Fourth, in order to increase robustness to any viewpoint variation, we present a new virtual camera-based rectification method to synthesize fronto-parallel views of refined object descriptors in 3-D space. Finally, experimental results achieved under a variety of challenging conditions show that integration of color space aggregation and laser reflectivity is superior to individuals. Specifically, the proposed perspective distortion rectification method remarkably eliminates false recognition error by 45.5%. Overall, the detection rate of our comprehensive method has up to 95.87% and the recognition rate even reaches 95.07% for traffic signs ranging within 100 m, with about 33.25 ms average running time per frame.	https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8013749	0
Analyzing and Enhancing the Security of Ultrasonic Sensors for Autonomous Vehicles	Autonomous vehicles rely on sensors to measure road condition and make driving decisions, and their safety relies heavily on the reliability of these sensors. Out of all obstacle detection sensors, ultrasonic sensors have the largest market share and are expected to be increasingly installed on automobiles. Such sensors discover obstacles by emitting ultrasounds and analyzing their reflections. By exploiting the built-in vulnerabilities of sensors, we designed random spoofing, adaptive spoofing, and jamming attacks on ultrasonic sensors, and we managed to trick a vehicle to stop when it should keep moving, and let it fail to stop when it should. We validate our attacks on stand-alone sensors and moving vehicles, including a Tesla Model S with the “Autopilot” system. The results show that the attacks cause blindness and malfunction of not only sensors but also autonomous vehicles, which can lead to collisions. To enhance the security of ultrasonic sensors and autonomous vehicles, we propose two defense strategies, single-sensor-based physical shift authentication that verifies signals on the physical level, and multiple sensor consistency check that employs multiple sensors to verify signals on the system level. Our experiments on real sensors and MATLAB simulation reveal the validity of both schemes.	https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8451864	0
Lateral Control of an Autonomous Vehicle	The asymptotic stabilization problem for a class of nonlinear under-actuated systems is studied and solved. Its solution, together with the back-stepping and the forwarding control design methods, is exploited in the control of the nonlinear lateral dynamics of a vehicle. Even though the theoretical studies of the lateral control of autonomous vehicles are traditionally applied to lane keeping cases, the results can be applied to broader range of areas, such as lane changing cases. The comparison between the performances of the closed-loop systems with the given controller and a typical human driver is given and demonstrates the speediness and the effectiveness of the feedback controller.	https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8286943	0
A Consensus-Based Approach for Platooning with Intervehicular Communications and Its Validation in Realistic Scenarios	Automated and coordinated vehicles' driving (platooning) is very challenging due to the multibody control complexity and the presence of unreliable time-varying wireless intervehicular communication (IVC). We propose a novel controller for vehicle platooning based on consensus and analytically demonstrate its stability and dynamic properties. Traditional approaches assume the logical control topology as a constraint fixed a priori, and the control law is designed consequently; our approach makes the control topology a design parameter that can be exploited to reconfigure the controller, depending on the needs and characteristics of the scenario. Furthermore, the controller automatically compensates outdated information caused by network losses and delays. The controller is implemented in Plexe, which is a state-of-the-art IVC and mobility simulator that includes basic building blocks for platooning. Analysis and simulations show the controller robustness and performance in several scenarios, including realistic propagation conditions with interference caused by other vehicles. We compare our approach against a controller taken from the literature, which is generally considered among the most performing ones. Finally, we test the proposed controller by implementing the real dynamics (engine, transmission, braking systems, etc.) of heterogeneous vehicles in Plexe and verifying that platoons remain stable and safe, regardless of real-life impairments that cannot be modeled in the analytic solution. The results show the ability of the proposed approach to maintain a stable string of realistic vehicles with different control-communication topologies, even in the presence of strong interference, delays, and fading conditions, providing higher comfort and safety for platoon drivers.	https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7499858	0
A Deep Learning Approach to UAV Image Multilabeling	In this letter, we face the problem of multilabeling unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) imagery, typically characterized by a high level of information content, by proposing a novel method based on convolutional neural networks. These are exploited as a means to yield a powerful description of the query image, which is analyzed after subdividing it into a grid of tiles. The multilabel classification task of each tile is performed by the combination of a radial basis function neural network and a multilabeling layer (ML) composed of customized thresholding operations. Experiments conducted on two different UAV image data sets demonstrate the promising capability of the proposed method compared to the state of the art, at the expense of a higher but still contained computation time.	https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7885056	0
A Semantic-Enabled Social Network of Devices for Building Automation	The progress of building automation devices and networks is curbed by application models with limited device autonomy, static configuration scenarios, and frequent explicit user interaction. This paper presents a novel approach inspired to social network interactions for increased object self-configuration and self-orchestration in home and building automation. Objects become autonomous social agents, interacting and coordinating automatically as new information about the environment is available. The framework is grounded on a service-oriented architecture for encapsulating, exchanging, and composing device capabilities and on semantic-based service description, discovery and aggregation exploiting nonstandard inference services. The proposed approach was implemented in two different testbeds and experimental evaluations of feasibility and performance were carried out with respect to a home automation case study.	https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7911227	0
Transforming a 3-D LiDAR Point Cloud Into a 2-D Dense Depth Map Through a Parameter Self-Adaptive Framework	The 3-D LiDAR scanner and the 2-D charge-coupled device (CCD) camera are two typical types of sensors for surrounding-environment perceiving in robotics or autonomous driving. Commonly, they are jointly used to improve perception accuracy by simultaneously recording the distances of surrounding objects, as well as the color and shape information. In this paper, we use the correspondence between a 3-D LiDAR scanner and a CCD camera to rearrange the captured LiDAR point cloud into a dense depth map, in which each 3-D point corresponds to a pixel at the same location in the RGB image. In this paper, we assume that the LiDAR scanner and the CCD camera are accurately calibrated and synchronized beforehand so that each 3-D LiDAR point cloud is aligned with its corresponding RGB image. Each frame of the LiDAR point cloud is then projected onto the RGB image plane to form a sparse depth map. Then, a self-adaptive method is proposed to upsample the sparse depth map into a dense depth map, in which the RGB image and the anisotropic diffusion tensor are exploited to guide upsampling by reinforcing the RGB-depth compactness. Finally, convex optimization is applied on the dense depth map for global enhancement. Experiments on the KITTI and Middlebury data sets demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms several other relevant state-of-the-art methods in terms of visual comparison and root-mean-square error measurement.	https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7482793	0
Integrated guidance and control design of the suicide UCAV for terminal attack	A novel integrated guidance and control (IGC) design method is proposed to solve problems of low control accuracy for a suicide unmanned combat aerial vehicle (UCAV) in the terminal attack stage. First of all, the IGC system model of the UCAV is built based on the three-channel independent design idea, which reduces the difsculties of designing the controller. Then, IGC control laws are designed using the trajectory linearization control (TLC). A nonlinear disturbance observer (NDO) is introduced to the IGC controller to reject various uncertainties, such as the aerodynamic parameter perturbation and the measurement error interference. The stability of the closed-loop system is proven by using the Lyapunov theorem. The performance of the proposed IGC design method is verised in a terminal attack mission of the suicide UCAV. Finally, simulation results demonstrate the superiority and effectiveness in the aspects of guidance accuracy and system robustness.	https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7978027	0

Sensitivity Analysis for Building Energy Simulation Model Calibration via Algorithmic Differentiation	High-fidelity building energy simulation models are software tools that are built on the well-established physical laws of thermal/hygric processes to model heating, cooling, lighting, ventilation, and energy use of buildings. They are highly nonlinear systems that involve a large number of subroutine calls and submodel switches during execution. To calibrate a building energy simulation model with good quality, parameter sensitivity analysis is well advocated, since it aims to identify those parameters in a specific building that hold more influence on the building thermal performance than others to facilitate shortening the lengthy cycle of model calibration procedures. Since simulation models are given in a large piece of source codes and encapsulate a series of submodels, the prevailing sensitivity analysis is mostly built within the framework of Monte Carlo simulation and statistics-based random sampling methods. It is computationally intensive. We propose to perform such analysis via a differential sensitivity analysis method that relies on the estimation of derivatives. A key technical challenge is that the high nonlinearity of the model prohibits any analytical differentiation, while numerical differentiation is too sensitive to step size and suffers from a truncation error. We, hence, propose to adopt an algorithmic differentiation method, which exploits the operator overload feature of object-oriented programs, to obtain accurate and robust numerical estimations of derivatives in an automated and computationally efficient way.	https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7508978	0
Object Matching for Inter-Vehicle Communication Systems—An IMM-Based Track Association Approach With Sequential Multiple Hypothesis Test	Autonomous driving poses unique challenges for vehicle environment perception due to the complex driving environment where the autonomous vehicle interacts with surrounding traffic participants. Due to the limited capability of any sensor perception system, it is highly desirable that an autonomous driving vehicle could use not only information from onboard sensors (say, radar/camera/lidar) but also from remote (network) information via inter-vehicle communication systems. The collaborative information from cooperative/non-cooperative remote vehicles (along with the onboard sensor data) could substantially improve the vehicle decision making process and push autonomous driving to be safer and more reliable. Inter-vehicle communication technologies are at the stage of development for market introduction, after years of research and standardization. In this paper, we setup a dedicated short range communication (DSRC) system to provide a low-latency inter-vehicle wireless communication channel. The task is to build a record linkage between the onboard sensor data and the corresponding DSRC-transmitted remote vehicle information when both sets belong to the same object, for the purpose of enhancing host vehicle environment perceiving capability and reliability. This is a typical data association problem. The challenges mainly lie in the inherent uncertain nature of the observation data and the practical issues that information often suffers from delays and drops. We propose a track-based association approach using an interacting multiple model estimator with a sequential multiple hypothesis test (denoted as IMM-SMHT) as an ubiquitous solution to handle different situations in complicated driving scenarios. To fully exploit the potential of such a system, only position information (from the DSRC channel and onboard radar system) is used for the object matching purpose-we try to use the least amount of information to achieve a high association accuracy; additional information can be used but not currently considered. We aim to provide a real world solution, and therefore, a prototype vehicle system is built with practical consideration on market availability, cost, and sensor limitations. We design meaningful use cases for creating functionality modules from a systematic point of view. The inter-vehicle information fusion system based on the track fusion approach using the IMM-SMHT is tested in real traffic on the U.S. roads and shows promising object matching performance of significant practical feasibility.	https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8039424	0
Authorship Attribution for Social Media Forensics	The veil of anonymity provided by smartphones with pre-paid SIM cards, public Wi-Fi hotspots, and distributed networks like Tor has drastically complicated the task of identifying users of social media during forensic investigations. In some cases, the text of a single posted message will be the only clue to an author's identity. How can we accurately predict who that author might be when the message may never exceed 140 characters on a service like Twitter? For the past 50 years, linguists, computer scientists, and scholars of the humanities have been jointly developing automated methods to identify authors based on the style of their writing. All authors possess peculiarities of habit that influence the form and content of their written works. These characteristics can often be quantified and measured using machine learning algorithms. In this paper, we provide a comprehensive review of the methods of authorship attribution that can be applied to the problem of social media forensics. Furthermore, we examine emerging supervised learning-based methods that are effective for small sample sizes, and provide step-by-step explanations for several scalable approaches as instructional case studies for newcomers to the field. We argue that there is a significant need in forensics for new authorship attribution algorithms that can exploit context, can process multi-modal data, and are tolerant to incomplete knowledge of the space of all possible authors at training time.	https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7555393	0
Intrusion Detection and Ejection Framework Against Lethal Attacks in UAV-Aided Networks: A Bayesian Game-Theoretic Methodology	Advances in wireless communications and microelectronics have spearheaded the development of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), which can be used to augment a ground network composed of sensors and/or vehicles in order to increase coverage, enhance the end-to-end delay, and improve data processing. While UAV-aided networks can potentially find applications in many areas, a number of issues, particularly security, have not been readily addressed. The intrusion detection system is the most commonly used technique to detect attackers. In this paper, we focus on addressing two main issues within the context of intrusion detection and attacker ejection in UAV-aided networks, namely, activation of the intrusion monitoring process and attacker ejection. In fact, when a large number of nodes activate their monitoring processes, the incurred overhead can be substantial and, as a consequence, degrades the network performance. Therefore, a tradeoff between the intrusion detection rate and overhead is considered in this work. It is not always the best strategy to eject a node immediately when it exhibits a bad sign of malicious activities since this sign could be provisional (the node may switch to a normal behavior in the future) or be simply due to noise or unreliable communications. Thus, a dilemma between detection and false positive rates is taken into account in this paper. We propose to address these two security issues by a Bayesian game model in order to accurately detect attacks (i.e., high detection and low false positive rates) with a low overhead. Simulation results have demonstrated that our proposed security game framework does achieve reliable detection.	https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7549080	0
Cooperative task allocation with simultaneous arrival and resource constraint for multi-UAV using a genetic algorithm	In recent years, the application of multi-UAV cooperation systems has expanded across various domains. Enhancing the coordination performance of multi-UAV systems can be achieved through task allocation methods, typically relying on a hierarchical structure. This paper proposes a novel approach using a modified genetic algorithm (GA) to address the integrated task allocation and path planning problems for multi-UAV attacking multi-target. To create a more realistic mission scenario, multiple constraints, such as resource requirement and simultaneous target arrival, are considered. The modified GA incorporates tailored crossover and mutation operators that ensure compliance with the aforementioned constraints. Furthermore, an unlocking strategy is devised to prevent the occurrence of a chromosome deadlock condition, in which several UAVs become stuck in an infinite waiting state. Through simulation results, the modified GA is demonstrated to effectively delivers feasible solutions to the coupled task allocation and path planning problems, preserving the integrated nature of the optimization process. Monte Carlo simulations are conducted to highlight the superiority of the proposed method in comparison to conventional approaches.

EML-PSP: A novel ensemble machine learning-based physical security paradigm using cross-domain ultra-fused feature extraction with hybrid data augmentation scheme	Seismic signals classification has many real-time applications related to monitoring and collecting information for investigations, public safety, and prevention of security breaches. We cross-amalgamated the seismic signals with acoustic data augmentation/feature extraction techniques, keeping the beneficial effects of each domain. In this context, we have identified the human walk from that of an animal by manipulating the seismic response. This work presents a robust automated system for surveillance against noisy environments for the classification of seismic events, which is trained to exploit the collected geo signals, namely the physical security dataset (PSD). In this context, an ensemble machine learning-based integrated physical security paradigm (EML-PSP) framework is proposed for automatically classifying humans and animals on seismic signals through a cross-domain ultra-fused feature extraction (UFFE) module using numerous speech-related feature extraction approaches. For the model to learn considerably, we have introduced a hybrid augmentation module (HAM) to synthesize realistic seismic signals based on multiple acoustic augmentation schemes. The ensemble features with enhanced discrimination power have been used to train ensemble algorithms like light-gradient boosted machine (LGBM), random forest-, and adaptive boosting-models. The exhaustive comparison of the proposed solution has been carried out with other state-of-the-art methods. On exploiting the UFFE-based features, the performance of the LGBM ensemble outnumbered other classifiers with an F1-Score of 0.9961 Â± 0.0031. The Matthews correlation coefficient and accuracy were 0.9841 Â± 0.0127 and 99.4111 Â± 0.0047 percent, respectively. The geo sensor's PSD results illustrated that the EML-PSP framework has adequate physical security and surveillance prospects.

MMAF-Net: Multi-view multi-stage adaptive fusion for multi-sensor 3D object detection	In this paper, we propose a 3D object detection method called MMAF-Net that is based on the multi-view and multi-stage adaptive fusion of RGB images and LiDAR point cloud data. This is an end-to-end architecture, which combines the characteristics of RGB images, the front view of point clouds based on reflection intensity, and the bird's eye view of point clouds. It also adopts a multi-stage fusion approach of âdata-level fusion + feature-level fusionâ to fully exploit the strength of multimodal information. Our proposed method addresses key challenges found in current 3D object detection methods for autonomous driving, including insufficient feature extraction from multimodal data, rudimentary fusion techniques, and sensitivity to distance and occlusion. To ensure the comprehensive integration of multimodal information, we present a series of targeted fusion methods. Firstly, we propose a novel input form that encodes dense point cloud reflectivity information into the image to enhance its representational power. Secondly, we design the Region Attention Adaptive Fusion module utilizing an attention mechanism to guide the network in adaptively adjusting the importance of different features. Finally, we extend the 2D DIOU (Distance Intersection over Union) loss function to 3D and develop a joint regression loss based on 3D_DIOU and SmoothL1 to optimize the similarity between detected and ground truth boxes. The experimental results on the KITTI dataset demonstrate that MMAF-Net effectively addresses the challenges posed by highly obscured or crowded scenes while maintaining real-time performance and improving the detection accuracy of smaller and more difficult objects that are occluded at far distances.

Adversarial deep reinforcement learning based robust depth tracking control for underactuated autonomous underwater vehicle	In this paper, an adversarial deep reinforcement learning-based control method is proposed to address the issue of robust depth tracking of an underactuated autonomous underwater vehicle in the presence of intrinsic coupled dynamics and external disturbances. First, long-short-term-memory neural network is presented to memorize and predict the changes in the state of vehicle, and a cascaded multilayer perception projects the output into action space of vehicle. Subsequently, adversarial deep reinforcement learning scheme is applied to the training of control agent by introducing an adversary which counteracts the control behavior, whereby the agent is enabled to learn the control strategy in different distributions of state transition. For evaluation of the performance, a control agent is pre-trained in simulation environment based on the reliable digital model of a real vehicle, and the simulation environment is paced at one iteration per second to align with real-time operations to ensure the portability of training result. Furthermore, the training cost is also extremely reduced. Finally, experiments are conducted with time-varying disturbances to further prove the feasibility of the proposed learning-based control scheme on a prototype of underwater vehicle in towing tank. Moreover, comparative experiment results show the better robustness performance of the learning-based control agent than that of classic line-of-sight based proportionalâintegralâderivative and adaptive line-of-sight based proportionalâintegralâderivative controllers in different scenarios.

IC-GAN: An Improved Conditional Generative Adversarial Network for RGB-to-IR image translation with applications to forest fire monitoring	This paper introduces a novel Deep Learning (DL) architecture for inferring temperature information from aerial true-color RGB images by transforming them into Infrared Radiation (IR) domain. This work is motivated by a few facts. First, off-the-shelf contemporary drones are typically equipped only with regular cameras. Second, IR heat-mapping cameras are costly and heavy for payload-limited drones. Third, additional communication channels and power supply would be needed when including IR cameras. Finally, IR cameras provide lower resolution and shorter distance ranges than RGB cameras. Therefore, learning-based translation of aerial IR recordings to RGB images can be extremely useful not only for new tests but also for offline processing of the currently available forest fire datasets with RGB images. We offer an Improved Conditional-Generative Adversarial Network (IC-GAN), where matched IR images are used as a condition to guide the translation process by the generator. The U-Net-based generator is concatenated with a mapper module to transform the output into a stack of diverse color spaces with learnable parameters. To avoid the unnecessary penalization of pixel-level disparities and achieve structural similarity, we include clustering alignment to the loss function. The proposed framework is compared against several state-of-the-art methods, including U-Net, Efficient U-Net, GAN, and Conditional-GAN from both subjective (human perception) and objective evaluation perspectives. The results support our method's efficacy, demonstrating a significant improvement of around 6% in PSNR, 15% in UQI, 9% in SSIM, and 23% in IoU metrics.

An improved sand cat swarm optimization for moving target search by UAV	Moving target search is a challenging dynamic path planning problem. In this scenario, unmanned aerial vehicles endeavor to locate a moving entity based on sensor information, utilizing the optimal path generated by a search algorithm. Based on the Bayesian principle, the task can be transformed into an optimization issue of the fitness function with the maximum probability of capturing the objective. In this study, an improved version of the sand cat swarm optimization algorithm, called the ISCSO search algorithm, is designed to tackle the moving target search issue effectively. Firstly, the presented ISCSO algorithm enhances the planning efficiency of the algorithm by encoding the unmanned aerial vehicle search path information into a set of motion paths through the motion-encoded mechanism. Secondly, the elite pooling strategy and the adaptive T-distribution are constructed to effectively improve the algorithm's ability to escape local optima and enhance its variability. Finally, ISCSO proposes a main architecture that seamlessly merges the search and attack methods of the sand cat swarm optimization algorithm, striking a balance between global and local search capabilities. To evaluate the superiority of the proposed algorithm, nine diverse search scenarios are constructed to verify its performance. The simulation results demonstrate that ISCSO achieves higher detection accuracy and offers more effective search paths for locating dynamic targets in comparison to other well-established metaheuristic algorithms.

Towards Autonomous Firefighting UAVs: Online Planners for Obstacle Avoidance and Payload Delivery	Drone technology is advancing rapidly and represents significant benefits during firefighting operations. This paper presents a novel approach for autonomous firefighting missions for Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs). The proposed UAV framework consists of a local planner module that finds an obstacle-free path to guide the vehicle toward a target zone. After detecting the target point, the UAV plans an optimal trajectory to perform a precision ballistic launch of an extinguishing ball, exploiting its kinematics. The generated trajectory minimises the overall traversal time and the final state error while respecting UAV dynamic limits. The performance of the proposed system is evaluated both in simulations and real tests with randomly positioned obstacles and target locations. The proposed framework has been employed in the 2022 UAV Competition of the International Conference on Unmanned Aircraft Systems (ICUAS), where it successfully completed the mission in several runs of increasing difficulty, both in simulation and in real scenarios, achieving third place overall.

Vision-Based Topological Localization for MAVs	Vision-based topological localization is recently emerging as a promising alternative to metric pose estimation techniques in robotic navigation systems. Contrarily to the latter, which suffer from a quick degradation of their performance under non-ideal conditions (e.g., scenes with poor illumination and low amount of textures), topological localization trades off precise metric positioning with a more robust and higher-level location representation. State-of-the-art works in this direction, however, often neglect the spatiotemporal relationships between poses that are naturally induced by robotic navigation. Furthermore, these techniques are nearly unexplored for autonomous flying platforms. Inspired by these considerations, in this work, we propose a vision-based topological localization approach designed for Micro Aerial Vehicles (MAVs) applications. Our strategy exploits the framework of graph recurrent neural networks to model the spatial and temporal dependencies and estimate the location of the robot with respect to a topological graph representing the environment. We demonstrate with experiments on different sets of scenarios, including scenes that considerably differ from those used in the training phase, that our approach is able to outperform state-of-the-art place recognition baselines.

Secure Video Offloading in Multi-UAV-Enabled MEC Networks: A Deep Reinforcement Learning Approach	Unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV)-enabled mobile-edge computing (MEC) has been widely applied in Internet of Things networks while the security risk of wireless computation offloading is still a challenging issue due to the openness nature of line-of-sight wireless channels between UAVs and edge devices (EDs). The existing secure offloading methods are not well targeted for video offloading in multi-UAV-enabled MEC networks since the joint potentiality of video distortion characteristics and multi-UAV flexible deployment in enhancing security is not exploited. In this article, we propose a secure video offloading strategy based on deep reinforcement learning (DRL) for a multi-UAV-enabled MEC system with a UAV eavesdropper. A joint optimization problem of resolution adjustment, offloading decision, computing capability allocation, communication resources orchestration, and multi-UAV position deployment is formulated to minimize system energy consumption under the constraints of offloading security, system latency, and users' quality of experience from the aspect of video frame analytic accuracy. Since the formulated problem is a high-dimensional nonlinear mixed-integer NP-hard problem, it is difficult to obtain the optimal solution via traditional optimization methods. To solve it, we propose a DRL algorithm (HRF-TD3) to instruct the agent to approach the optimal solution efficiently. The simulation results show that the proposed algorithm is superior to comparison algorithms in terms of system energy consumption, EDs' energy consumption, and system latency under the condition of wireless offloading security.

Adaptive Coding and Modulation-Aided Mobile Relaying for Millimeter-Wave Flying Ad Hoc Networks	The emerging drone swarms are capable of carrying out sophisticated tasks in support of demanding Internet of Things (IoT) applications by synergistically working together. However, the target area may be out of the coverage of the ground station (GS) and it may be impractical to deploy a large number of drones in the target area due to cost, electromagnetic interference, and flight-safety regulations. By exploiting the innate agility and mobility of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), we conceive a mobile relaying-assisted drone swarm network architecture, which is capable of extending the coverage of the GS and enhancing the effective end-to-end throughput. Explicitly, a swarm of drones forms a data-collecting drone swarm (DCDS) designed for sensing and collecting data with the aid of their mounted cameras and/or sensors, and a powerful relay-UAV (RUAV) acts as a mobile relay for conveying data between the DCDS and a GS. Given a time period, in order to maximize the data delivered while minimizing the delay imposed, we harness an $\epsilon $ -multiple-objective genetic algorithm ( $\epsilon $ -MOGA)-assisted Pareto-optimization scheme. Our simulation results demonstrate that the proposed mobile relaying is capable of delivering more data. As specific examples investigated in our simulations, our mobile relaying-assisted drone swarm network is capable of delivering 45.38% more data than the benchmark solutions, when a stationary relay is available, and it is capable of delivering 26.86% more data than the benchmark solutions when no stationary relay is available.

Multiagent Reinforcement Learning in Controlling Offloading Ratio and Trajectory for Multi-UAV Mobile-Edge Computing	In this article, a multiunmanned aerial vehicle-mobile-edge computing (UAV-MEC) network is proposed for mobile devices (MDs) located far from a terrestrial base station (BS)-MEC. In the UAV-MEC network, the MDs offload tasks to the UAV-MECs, followed by task offloading from the UAV-MECs to the BS-MEC. Each UAV-MEC aims to jointly optimize its energy consumption, queue stability, and the energy consumption of the MDs by controlling its trajectory and offloading ratio. Specifically, the trajectories of the UAV-MECs are controlled to locate themselves at the optimal positions where the transmission energy of the MDs is minimized. Additionally, the UAV-MECs consider the constraints of task processing time and queue stability in determining the amount of task to be offloaded. Thus, an independent proximal policy optimization (IPPO)-based offloading and trajectory control learning model (IM) is proposed to solve these problems, and a convex optimization model (CM) is also presented to show the optimality of the proposed IM. Specifically, in IM, a near-optimal trajectory control for the randomly located MDs is enabled by exploiting channel gain information only without resorting to accurate location information of the MDs. Furthermore, a dynamic offloading ratio control of each UAV-MEC is achieved by considering its queue dynamics. The simulation results show that the proposed IM jointly optimizes energy consumption and queue stability. Consequently, it outperforms other deep reinforcement learning (DRL)-based algorithms by achieving low energy consumption and long service duration. Moreover, it achieves similar performance to CM while requiring remarkably less time on action decision.

IRS-Assisted Cognitive UAV Networks: Joint Sensing Duration, Passive Beamforming, and 3-D Location Optimization	In this article, to enhance the communication quality of cognitive unmanned aerial vehicle networks (CUAVNs), we investigate the intelligent reflecting surface (IRS)-Assisted CUAVNs, where a leading UAV (LUAV) is deployed for sensing spectrum and a group of following UAVs (FUAVs) transmit data to LUAV with the aid of IRS. Our objective is to maximize the achievable throughput of CUAVNs by jointly optimizing sensing duration, IRS passive beamforming, and LUAV's 3-D location, where LUAV's 3-D location is restricted by IRS, FUAVs, and primary user. For the IRS-Assisted single FUAV case, the intractable nonconvex optimization problem is resolved into three subproblems, which are solved by utilizing the bisection search method, the closed-form expression of the optimal IRS phase shift matrix and the successive convex approximation method, respectively. Finally, an efficient alternating optimization algorithm is developed to obtain a high-quality suboptimal solution. By exploiting the solutions of single FUAV, we further propose the throughput weighted sum (TWS) algorithm to solve the intricate nonconvex problem in IRS-Assisted multiple FUAVs case. To further reduce the complexity of TWS, the low-complexity location weighted sum (LWS) algorithm is proposed. Numerical results show that compared to the scheme without IRS assistance, the achievable throughput increases about 102% with the proposed single FUAV scheme, and over 88% with the proposed TWS-based multiple FUAVs scheme. Moreover, the performance gap between the low-complexity LWS and the TWS is less than 7%. Â© 2014 IEEE.	https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85164669605&origin=inward	0
TriBoDeS: A Tri-Blockchain-Based Detection and Sharing Scheme for Dangerous Road Condition Information in Internet of Vehicles	Bad weather or environmental factors, particularly in remote mountain areas, may result in unsafe driving conditions and consequently road traffic accidents. As the deployment of large-scale sensing nodes for reporting road conditions is too expensive, the crowdsourcing method or reporting by sensors in vehicles themselves will be easier to deploy and more practical. However, those participant sensing methods impose some difficulties, such as fake information, reporter misbehavior, and timeliness. Thus, we propose a tri-blockchain-based Internet of Vehicles system, called TriBoDeS, to facilitate real-time information detection and sharing. It is designed to guarantee concurrency and security to dynamically store, manage, and share information uploaded by vehicles with great efficiency. Such information will be announced on the blockchain under the autonomous identification of vehicles in low-trust conditions. In order to ensure the software's security, TriBoDeS can monitor the software's state, detect identified malicious activities, and respond accordingly. To ensure data security, a role-based management mechanism is introduced to achieve fine-grained control over permissions, and confidence rules are established to guarantee the authenticity of the data. To demonstrate the applicability of the proposed scheme, we evaluate its performance (e.g., computing and communication overheads) and security (e.g., resiliency against common attacks) over a consortium blockchain. The experimental results demonstrate that, under the conditions of a sufficient number of vehicles, the TriBoDeS system is capable of real-time information sharing while ensuring the security of user information. Compared to conventional single-chain systems, the TriBoDeS system achieves a 2.75-time improvement in efficiency.

Pilot Assignment and Power Control in Secure UAV-Enabled Cell-Free Massive MIMO Networks	This article investigates the pilot assignment and power control (PC) problems for secure unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) communications in a cell-free massive multi-input-multioutput network with the user-centric scheme, where numerous distributed access points (APs) simultaneously serve multiple UAVs and terminal users. Meanwhile, there exists one UAV acting as an eavesdropper which can perform pilot spoofing attack. Considering a mixture of Rayleigh and Rician fading channels, the APs, respectively, perform minimum mean-square error estimation and distributed conjugate beamforming for uplink training and downlink data transmission. Using the random matrix theory, the closed-form expression for a tight lower bound on the achievable secrecy rate is derived, which enables the impact analysis of key parameters, such as power, antenna configuration, UAV height, etc. Taking into account both performance and complexity, a novel pilot assignment scheme is proposed by combining the weighted graphic framework and genetic algorithm, which can actualize global search with limited iterations. The max-min PC with security constraints is then studied in parallel, which can not only enhance the network fairness but also ensure the security. Accordingly, successive convex approximation and fractional optimization are jointly utilized to solve this nonconvex problem. Simulation results numerically verify the analytical results and indicate the superiority of the proposed pilot assignment and PC schemes.

Comparison of Scanning Strategies in UAV-Mounted Multichannel GPR-SAR Systems Using Antenna Arrays	Ground Penetrating Radar (GPR) systems on board Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) have been successfully used for subsurface imaging applications. Their capability to detect buried targets avoiding the contact with the soil turn these systems into a great solution to detect buried threats, such as landmines and Improvised Explosive Devices (IEDs). Significant advances have been also conducted to enhance the detection capabilities of these systems, complementing the Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) processing methods with several clutter mitigation techniques. However, the improvement in the scanning throughput (i.e., increasing the inspected area in a given time) remains a significant challenge. In this regard, this article compares several scanning strategies for UAV-mounted multichannel GPR-SAR systems using antenna arrays. In particular, two different scanning strategies have been compared: a uniform scheme and a non-uniform strategy called 3X. In addition, different across-track spacing values to generate dense and sparse sampling distributions were considered for each scanning scheme. After conducting a theoretical analysis of these strategies, they have been experimentally validated with measurements gathered with a portable scanner and during flights in realistic scenarios. Results show that the dense configurations of both scanning strategies yield good quality images of buried targets while improving the scanning throughput (compared to a single-channel architecture). In particular, the dense uniform scheme (with a 20 cm across-track spacing) achieves a greater reduction in the inspection time, compared to the dense 3X strategy, at the expense of a slightly smaller signal to clutter ratio.

On the use of filament-based free wake panel methods for preliminary design of propeller-wing configurations	With distributed propulsion and electric vertical take-off and landing aircraft on the rise, fast and accurate methods to simulate propeller slipstreams and their interaction with aircraft components are needed. In this work, we compare results obtained with a filament-based free wake panel method to experimental and previously validated numerical data. In particular, we study a propeller-wing configuration at zero angle of attack and the aerodynamics of the blade-resolved slipstream interaction with the wing. We use a prescribed wake on the wing and a free wake on the propeller, which greatly accelerate the computations. Results indicate that, while forces are overpredicted due to the inviscid nature of the panel method, the free wake is able to capture the slipstream deformation and shearing with remarkable success. We find that a filament-based free wake panel method can be a useful tool for propeller-wing interaction in preliminary aircraft design.

Trajectory Inference of Unknown Linear Systems Based on Partial States Measurements	Proliferation of cheaper autonomous system prototypes has magnified the threat space for attacks across the manufacturing, transport, and smart living sectors. An accurate trajectory inference algorithm is required for monitoring and early detection of autonomous misbehavior and to take relevant countermeasures. This article presents a trajectory inference algorithm based on a CLOE approach using partial states measurements. The approach is based on a physics informed state parameteterization that combines the main advantages of state estimation and identification algorithms. Noise attenuation and parameter estimates convergence are obtained if the output trajectories fulfill a persistent excitation condition. Known and unknown desired reference/destination cases are considered. The stability and convergence of the proposed approach are assessed via Lyapunov stability theory under the fulfillment of a persistent excitation condition. Simulation studies are carried out to verify the effectiveness of the proposed approach. IEEE	https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85182375095&origin=inward	0
Threat Assessment Strategy of Human-in-the-Loop Unmanned Underwater Vehicle Under Uncertain Events	Gls UUV is an intelligent underwater platform that can operate autonomously. However, it is difficult for unmanned underwater vehicle (UUV) to make correct decisions timely and independently in the face of uncertain events. Therefore, it is necessary to assess the threat of uncertain events and guide UUV to make timely and accurate decisions. This article studies the threat assessment strategy of a human-in-the-loop UUV under uncertain events. First, the uncertain events are classified according to their characteristics, and the Bayesian network (BN) is constructed by taking the characteristic variables of uncertain events as neurons. Then, the human experiences are combined with the genetic optimization algorithm to determine the BN parameters. According to the reasoning of the BN, the threat of uncertain events is evaluated. Finally, according to the threat assessment results, the PSO and A/B model are used to replan the task. The proposed algorithm uses BN to represent uncertain events and introduces human experiences to optimize network parameters, eliminating subjective bias and improving the accuracy of threat assessment. At the same time, the task replanning strategy is introduced to ensure the security of UUV. Four typical UUV tasks are designed, and the trigger elements of uncertain events are set in the simulation to verify the performance of the proposed algorithm. The simulation and experiment results show that a UUV can accurately assess the threat level of uncertain events during the task execution process when using the proposed strategy. The safety of the human-in-the-loop UUV operation is guaranteed by task replanning. Â© 2013 IEEE.	https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85173006705&origin=inward	0
Finite-time Security Control of Networked Unmanned Marine Vehicle Systems Subject to DoS Attack	The finite-time dynamic positioning controller design problem of the unmanned marine vehicle (UMV) system under switching DoS attacks is investigated. Firstly, an adaptive memory-based event-triggering communication mechanism (METCM) is designed to save networked resources in maritime environment. Second, the signals released by the communication mechanism are quantized to further reduce the bandwidth of the communication network. In addition, since adversary may have multiple attack strategies, thus a hierarchical semi-Markov process (HS-MP) is presented to capture the phenomenon of switching DoS attacks, which makes the attack model more realistic. Further, sufficient conditions are proposed for the finite-time boundedness (FTB) of the UMV system and some linear matrix inequalities are solved to determine the finite-time bounded controller gain. Finally, the effectiveness of the proposed control method is demonstrated by a simulation example. IEEE	https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85182364174&origin=inward	0
UGEN: UAV and GAN-aided Ensemble Network for Post-Disaster Survivor Detection through ORAN	Post-disaster scene understanding frameworks are increasingly crucial in Search And Rescue (SAR) operations. Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) provide an efficient means to carry out the task of scene understanding due to the higher altitudes at which they function. However, complex environments in post-disaster scenarios make it difficult for UAVs to detect humans or objects accurately. Inefficient object detection mechanisms lead to low accuracy for object detection tasks. Hence, to mitigate these issues, we propose a UAV and GAN-aided Ensemble Network (UGEN) framework for efficient ORAN-based post-disaster survivor detection. This approach deploys a Context-Conditional Generative Adversarial Network (CCGAN)- based model to remove occlusion in the images obtained from the UAVs. The UGEN framework classifies entities present in the visual scope of the UAV using a semantic segmentation framework deployed on the CCGAN-enhanced images, resulting in a pixel-level prediction of entities present in the post-disaster images. An ensemble network comprising a combination of single-stage and multi-stage detectors detects survivors present in the post-disaster scenario, thereby combining the benefits of both architectures, resulting in a reduced false negative rate and improved performance. An Open Radio Access Network (ORAN) executes data propagation between the UAV and the ground station for reduced transmission latency. The proposed model achieved a survivor detection accuracy of 96.7%. Authors	https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85181562908&origin=inward	0
Cooperative Active Learning-Based Dual Control for Exploration and Exploitation in Autonomous Search	In this article, a multi-estimator based computationally efficient algorithm is developed for autonomous search in an unknown environment with an unknown source. Different from the existing approaches that require massive computational power to support nonlinear Bayesian estimation and complex decision-making process, an efficient cooperative active-learning-based dual control for exploration and exploitation (COAL-DCEE) is developed for source estimation and path planning. Multiple cooperative estimators are deployed for environment learning process, which is helpful to improving the search performance and robustness against noisy measurements. The number of estimators used in COAL-DCEE is much smaller than that of the particles required for Bayesian estimation in information-theoretic approaches. Consequently, the computational load is significantly reduced. As an important feature of this study, the convergence and performance of COAL-DCEE are established in relation to the characteristics of sensor noises and turbulence disturbances. Numerical and experimental studies have been carried out to verify the effectiveness of the proposed framework. Compared with the existing approaches, COAL-DCEE not only provides convergence guarantee but also yields comparable search performance using much less computational power.

Haptic Search With the Smart Suction Cup on Adversarial Objects	Suction cups are an important gripper type in industrial robot applications, and the prior literature focuses on using vision-based planners to improve grasping success in these tasks. Vision-based planners can fail due to adversarial objects or lose generalizability for unseen scenarios, without retraining learned algorithms. In this article, we propose haptic exploration to improve suction cup grasping when visual grasp planners fail. We present the smart suction cup, an end effector that utilizes internal flow measurements for tactile sensing. We show that model-based haptic search methods, guided by these flow measurements, improve grasping success by up to 2.5Ã as compared with using only a vision planner during a bin-picking task. In characterizing the smart suction cup on both geometric edges and curves, we find that flow rate can accurately predict the ideal motion direction even with large postural errors. The smart suction cup includes no electronics on the cup itself, such that the design is easy to fabricate and haptic exploration does not damage the sensor. This work motivates the use of suction cups with autonomous haptic search capabilities in especially adversarial scenarios.

IdentifierIDS: A Practical Voltage-Based Intrusion Detection System for Real In-Vehicle Networks	â As innovative technologies such as autonomous driving, over-the-air technology, and vehicle-to-everything are widely applied to intelligent connected vehicles, people can gain a more convenient and safer driving experience. Although the application of these technologies facilitates our lives, they also bring a series of vulnerable interfaces (such as 5G, Bluetooth, and WiFi), which pose a significant security threat to existing in-vehicle networks. To address these threats, researchers have proposed two mainstream schemes, including message authentication and intrusion detection system (IDS), where the scheme of message authentication needs to occupy the limited bandwidth of controller area network (CAN) bus. Furthermore, most IDSs either cannot locate the sender of the attack, fail to detect aperiodic malicious frames, or require prior knowledge of which CAN identifiers (IDs) belong to which electronic control units (ECUs). To address these weaknesses, we propose a practical voltage-based IDS named IdentifierIDS for real in-vehicle networks. To the best of our knowledge, it is the first scheme to detect intrusions by establishing a voltage fingerprint for each ID without the need for prior knowledge. This allows IdentifierIDS to detect both periodic and aperiodic malicious frames without occupying the limited bandwidth of the CAN bus. As a self-learning IDS, it can adapt to different in-vehicle networks without the need for customization for them. Experiments on three real vehicles demonstrate the robustness of our scheme in different in-vehicle networks. Â© 2023 IEEE.

Sketch RL: Interactive Sketch Generation for Long-Horizon Tasks via Vision-Based Skill Predictor	For autonomous robots, it is desirable to learn coordination of primitive skills that can effectively solve long-horizon tasks and perform novel ones. Recent advances in hierarchical policy learning have shown that decomposing complex tasks into sequences of primitive skills which are called sketches can enable robots to perform directed exploration in challenging manipulation tasks. However, they usually fall short in sequencing skills in a new task without retraining as the task sketches are almost hard-coded or learned by deep reinforcement learning. To improve exploration efficiency for long-horizon tasks, we propose Sketch RL, a hierarchical framework that combines supervised learning with reinforcement learning interactively generates the task sketch, and utilizes it as the curriculum to guide low-level skill learning. Furthermore, to allow for multitask decomposition and generalizing few-shot to new tasks, our method exploits a Vision-based Skill Predictor (VSP) to capture shared subtask structure. Extensive experiments on challenging manipulation tasks demonstrate that Sketch RL substantially outperforms other prior baseline methods and is capable of adapting to new tasks with different sketches and real-world settings.

Automatic Seabed Target Segmentation of AUV via Multilevel Adversarial Network and Marginal Distribution Adaptation	The real-time segmentation results of side-scan sonar (SSS) images can realize the intelligent perception of autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs). However, there remains a compelling challenge that the models trained with training data may not generalize well in practical applications due to the various marine conditions/working devices. This article proposes a real-time cross-domain segmentation adaptation scheme for SSS images based on adversarial training via min-max training to distribute SSS images in the output space and marginal distribution adaption to improve the segmentation performance by minimizing the measured distribution distance. To further enhance the adapted model, the multilayer feature discriminators are established to realize the fine-grained alignment. Experiments on the real-world SSS datasets demonstrate that our proposed model outperforms state-of-the-art methods and achieves the actual industrial application for AUV.

Event-Based Distributed Secure Control of Unmanned Surface Vehicles With DoS Attacks	This study investigates the distributed secure control problem of multiple unmanned surface vehicles (USVs) in the presence of wave-induced disturbances and unified abrupt and incipient rudder angle faults in physical layer, and aperiodic Denial-of-Service (DoS) attacks in cyber layer. Multi-USVs with rudder angle fault and DoS attack modeling are first established. Then, the decentralized unknown input observer (UIO)-based fault estimation and distributed secure control approach is developed in a co-designed framework for multi-USVs with cyber–physical threats. Advantages of the proposed secure scheme are: 1) actuator faults, DoS attacks, and event-triggering strategies with varying action instants, durations, and locations are synchronously addressed and 2) the criteria of exponential consensus are derived by virtue of attack frequency and average dwelling time technique without prior knowledge of unknown wave-induced perturbation bounds and elimination of Zeno behavior in an event-based mechanism. Comparative simulations outline the performance and advantage of the proposed distributed secure control algorithm.

3D Trajectory Optimization for Multimission UAVs in Smart City Scenarios	There is a definite possibility that, in a recent future, Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) will form the backbone of any smart city in terms of automation and networking. One approach to extend the UAVs' resources spectrum is to provide a mean for them to opportunistically recharge and connect to otherwise unreachable networks: provide Training and Recharge Areas (TRAs). In these dedicated areas, the UAVs could dock to Energy and Data Dispensers (EDD) devices to resupply their batteries and exploit a high-speed connection. To autonomously move through the smart city while accomplishing a set of given tasks but, at the same time, consider visiting the EDDs, is part of a tridimensional trajectory planning problem that needs to be addressed. In this paper, we formally define the combinatorial optimization problem representing the trajectory planning. We consider the case in which more than one UAV can be connected with the same EDD at the same time, by properly addressing the assignment of the bandwidth. Through simulative investigation, realistic values for the solution of the optimization problem are found. The behavior of the proposed model is compared with an 'online' approach that does not require the same resources and knowledge and whose evaluation and comparison with the 'offline' approach are performed through network simulation.

Robust Trajectory and Offloading for Energy-Efficient UAV Edge Computing in Industrial Internet of Things	Efficient data processing and computation are essential for the Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) to empower various applications, which can be significantly bottlenecked by the limited energy capacity and computation capability of the IIoT nodes. In this article, we employ an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) as an edge server to assist IIoT data processing, while considering the practical issue of UAV jittering. Specifically, we propose a joint design on trajectory and offloading strategies to minimize energy consumption due to local and edge computation, as well as data transmission. We particularly address UAV jittering that induces Gaussian-distributed uncertainties associated with flying waypoints, resulting in probabilistic-form flying speed and data offloading constraints. We exploit the Bernstein-type inequality to reformulate the constraints in deterministic forms and decompose the energy minimization to solve for trajectory and offloading separately within an alternating optimization framework. The subproblems are then tackled with the successive convex approximation technique. Simulation results show that our proposal strictly guarantees robustness under uncertainties and effectively reduces energy consumption as compared with the baselines.

Iterative RNDOP-Optimal Anchor Placement for Beyond Convex Hull ToA-based Localization: Performance Bounds and Heuristic Algorithms	Localizing targets outside the anchors' convex hull is an understudied but prevalent scenario in vehicle-centric, UAV-based, and self-localization applications. Considering such scenarios, this paper studies the optimal anchor placement problem for Time-of-Arrival (ToA)-based localization schemes such that the <italic>worst-case Dilution of Precision (DOP)</italic> is minimized. Building on prior results on DOP scaling laws for beyond convex hull ToA-based localization, we propose a novel metric termed the <italic>Range-Normalized DOP (RNDOP)</italic>. We show that the worst-case DOP-optimal anchor placement problem simplifies to a min-max RNDOP-optimal anchor placement problem. Unfortunately, this formulation results in a non-convex and intractable problem under realistic constraints. To overcome this, we propose iterative anchor addition schemes, which result in a tractable albeit non-convex problem. By exploiting the structure arising from the resultant rank-1 update, we devise three heuristic schemes with varying performance-complexity tradeoffs. In addition, we also derive the upper and lower bounds for scenarios where we are placing anchors to optimize the worst-case (a) 3D positioning error and (b) 2D positioning error. We build on these results to design a cohesive iterative algorithmic framework for robust anchor placement, characterize the impact of anchor position uncertainty, and then discuss the computational complexity of the proposed schemes. Using numerical results, we validate the accuracy of our theoretical results. We also present comprehensive Monte-Carlo simulation results to compare the positioning error and execution time performance of each iterative scheme, discuss the tradeoffs, and provide valuable system design insights for beyond convex hull localization scenarios.

Task Accuracy Enhancement for a Surgical Macro-Micro Manipulator With Probabilistic Neural Networks and Uncertainty Minimization	Accurate robot kinematic modelling is a major component for autonomous robot control to guarantee safety and precision during task execution. In surgical robotics complex robotic structures and actuation mechanisms are generally employed, therefore machine learning techniques can be adopted to build the model of the robot. Probabilistic neural networks are a class of learning approaches that provide information about the uncertainty of the learnt models. In this work we compare two different probabilistic neural networks (Bayesian and Evidential Neural Networks) to model the kinematics of a surgical robotic instrument and propose a control strategy based on Hierarchical Quadratic Programming (HQP) capable of exploiting the model uncertainty to improve the accuracy and safety of the controller. Simulation and real world experiments on different autonomous path tracking tasks show that the model uncertainty highly affects the control performances and prove the effectiveness of the proposed controller in improving task execution. Note to Practitioners - The push towards reducing invasiveness and patient's traumas in surgery has lead to the requirement of miniaturized and highly articulated robots. This however comes at the cost of having systems that are hard to model and control, which is one of the major limitations for autonomy in surgical robotics. Machine learning has become very effective in modelling complex systems and probabilistic approaches additionally allow estimating the confidence of the learnt model. In robotics field where high precision is required to perform an autonomous task, like in minimally invasive surgery, the robot model needs to be very accurate and controllers need to guarantee safety in performing the desired task, while satisfying additional motion constraints imposed by the application scenario. This work proposes the use of probabilistic neural networks to model the complexity of a surgical robotic instrument and a control strategy capable of ensuring safety by maximizing model's confidence and guaranteeing satisfaction of imposed motion constraints. In this work a macro-micro manipulator setup is employed, consisting of an articulated surgical robotic instrument connected to a serial-link manipulator. The proposed modelling and control approaches can be used in any other field where controllers need to highly rely on the robot model due to limitations in using external sensors and where leveraging information about model's confidence can be beneficial. Currently, the work focuses only on pure kinematic modelling and control, thus neglecting any possible interaction with the environment. Future work will focus on addressing this limitation in order to ensure proper force control and effective autonomy.

Autonomous Manipulation of an Underwater Vehicle-Manipulator System by a Composite Control Scheme With Disturbance Estimation	This article addresses an autonomous manipulation problem for an underwater vehicle-manipulator system (UVMS) operating in a free-floating way while subjecting to unknown continuous disturbance. More specifically, a composite control scheme composed of disturbance observer (DOB), predictor model network (PM-Net), and nonlinear model predictive control (NMPC), is devised to improve the control performance of UVMS (i.e., unicycle-like UVMS actuated only in the surge, heave, and yaw for vehicle body) in the case of disturbance, model mismatch, and input saturation. A RBF-DOB is formulated by combining a DOB and a Radial Basis Function (RBF) neural network to estimate disturbance at the current step. Then, the PM-Network, composed of a disturbance predictor network and state predictor network, is developed based on long short-term memory (LSTM) network that predicts UVMS state sequences considering model mismatch and disturbance. The NMPC is deployed as a feedback control law to endow the input saturation of the UVMS and produce optimal control action. Compared with conventional DOB control methods using feed-forward compensation of disturbance, the primary merit of the proposed approach is that the disturbance estimated by RBF-DOB is utilized in the PM-Net to predict future UVMS state sequences, which are exploited on the NMPC's receding optimization. Finally, realistic simulation and relevant experiment are conducted to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method. Note to Practitioners - The motivation behind this article is the autonomous manipulation of an underwater vehicle-manipulator system subjected to unknown disturbance. However, it is not always feasible or straightforward to obtain the external disturbance and unmodeled dynamics for designing robust controllers. On the one hand, how to manipulate the disturbance into the designed controller to generate optimal control action rather than by using feed-forward compensation. On the other hand, the control input saturation often occurs in the UVMS control, especially under the disturbance rejection conditions, where it should be considered in the controller design. Currently, the predominant methods for UVMS control lack a control scheme that provides a complete and credible control strategy that takes the aforementioned issues into consideration. Motivated by the above analysis, this study provides a composite control scheme to deal with the dynamic uncertainties, unknown disturbance, and input saturation. The results of realistic simulation and relevant experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method. Hopefully, our control method can provide valuable theoretical and technical guidance to practicing marine engineers for controller design.

Fast adversarial attacks to deep neural networks through gradual sparsification	Deep learning networks, emerging machine learning models that present beyond human-level performance in terms of accuracy, are critically vulnerable to adversarial attacks. This vulnerability limits the utilization of deep learning architecture in many real-world safety-critical applications such as autonomous vehicles, medical diagnosis, sensitive industrial systems, etc. Adversarial attacks are methods to measure the robustness of different architectures and can be used to evaluate the suitability of a model to be used in a safety-critical situation. White-box sparse adversarial attacks can unhide interesting features of deep learning networks by identifying critical elements in the input pattern to design black-box attacks. This motivated us to design a new algorithmic procedure to design sparse adversarial attacks to feed-forward neural networks based on sparsity regularization. The proposed method comes with the gradual sparsification which starts by designing a dense attack and prone it until a desired level of sparsity is attained. We evaluate the performance of the proposed algorithm in designing attacks on convolutional neural networks and attention-based architectures for image classification task using three non-smooth sparsity-promoting regularizers. Compared to the state-of-the-art sparse attack schemes, we show that the proposed method can significantly decrease the time needed to design the attack, while the perturbation distortion is unchanged or reduced in some cases.

ESUAV-NI: Endogenous Security Framework for UAV Perception System Based on Neural Immunity	Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) represent an essential component of advanced intelligent equipment that can be used as an aerial perception system by installing various sensors such as vision, hearing, touch, taste, and smell to achieve intelligently integrated perception of environments. However, these perception system with environmental information may be threatened by various internal and external attacks, causing a great challenge to the security of the UAV. The original security system relied on an expert knowledge base to prevent attacks, but the weaknesses of lacking proactivity and flexibility are gradually exposed. The strong resistance and survivability of biological systems can be used to fill this capability gap and provide new ideas for the security of the UAV perception system. Therefore, an endogenous security framework (ESUAV-NI) based on the neural system and immune system is proposed in this article. Through breeding artificial intelligence (AI) vaccines and distributed neural hierarchical control, we achieve the security protection for the UAV perception system. Moreover, we evaluated the AI vaccine breeding approach in the ESUAV-NI by conducting extensive experiments on internal threats and external aerial imagery camouflage data, respectively. The results show that the proposed approach has a superior performance for the UAV perception system.

Goal-Guided and Interaction-Aware State Refinement Graph Attention Network for Multi-Agent Trajectory Prediction	Multi-agent trajectory prediction plays a pivotal role for intelligent transportation and autonomous driving. Modeling the social interaction among agents and revealing the inherent relationship between interaction and future trajectory are crucial for accurate trajectory prediction. To address these challenges, this letter proposes a goal-guided and interaction-aware state refinement graph attention network (SRGAT) for multi-agent trajectory prediction. Specifically, the trajectory sequence of individual agent is firstly converted into a compact representation by exploiting Transformer encoder and gated recurrent unit (GRU). Then, a social state refinement (SSR) module for modeling social influence between agents is proposed to include more interaction-related features. Subsequently, multiple goals are predicted for each agent, followed by another goal-guided SSR module to incorporate goal information into social interaction. Finally, the multimodal trajectory is forecasted by fusing the features from forward and backward GRU. Experiments on public benchmark datasets are carried out to evaluate the effectiveness of our model. The results demonstrate the superior performance of our model compared with the state-of-the-art methods.

Detection and Mitigation of Position Spoofing Attacks on Cooperative UAV Swarm Formations	Detecting spoofing attacks on the positions of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) within a swarm is challenging. Traditional methods relying solely on individually reported positions and pairwise distance measurements are ineffective in identifying the misbehavior of malicious UAVs. This paper presents a novel systematic structure designed to detect and mitigate spoofing attacks in UAV swarms. We formulate the problem of detecting malicious UAVs as a localization feasibility problem, leveraging the reported positions and distance measurements. To address this problem, we develop a semidefinite relaxation (SDR) approach, which reformulates the non-convex localization problem into a convex and tractable semidefinite program (SDP). Additionally, we propose two innovative algorithms that leverage the proximity of neighboring UAVs to identify malicious UAVs effectively. Simulations demonstrate the superior performance of our proposed approaches compared to existing benchmarks. Our methods exhibit robustness across various swarm networks, showcasing their effectiveness in detecting and mitigating spoofing attacks. Specifically, the detection success rate is improved by up to 65%, 55%, and 51% against distributed, collusion, and mixed attacks, respectively, compared to the benchmarks.

LCPR: A Multi-Scale Attention-Based LiDAR-Camera Fusion Network for Place Recognition	Place recognition is one of the most crucial modules for autonomous vehicles to identify places that were previously visited in GPS-invalid environments. Sensor fusion is considered an effective method to overcome the weaknesses of individual sensors. In recent years, multimodal place recognition fusing information from multiple sensors has gathered increasing attention. However, most existing multimodal place recognition methods only use limited field-of-view camera images, which leads to an imbalance between features from different modalities and limits the effectiveness of sensor fusion. In this letter, we present a novel neural network named LCPR for robust multimodal place recognition, which fuses LiDAR point clouds with multi-view RGB images to generate discriminative and yaw-rotation invariant representations of the environment. A multi-scale attention-based fusion module is proposed to fully exploit the panoramic views from different modalities of the environment and their correlations. We evaluate our method on the nuScenes dataset, and the experimental results show that our method can effectively utilize multi-view camera and LiDAR data to improve the place recognition performance while maintaining strong robustness to viewpoint changes.	https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=10373064	0
PDLC-LIO: A Precise and Direct SLAM System Toward Large-Scale Environments With Loop Closures	As a key technology of autonomous driving, the high-precision vehicle localization is the prerequisite for automatic steer. With the advantage of accuracy and robustness, the Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR) is widely employed in Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM), which has been utilized to provide reliable positioning information. Compared with the experimental vehicles in the restricted laboratory driving circumstances, autonomous vehicles are devoted to actual roads and contain complicated activities, where closed loops can be noticed. In general, the accumulated error may be accumulated with the increasing of maneuver scope of SLAM. A distinct drift phenomenon may thus be incurred in the completed point cloud map and threaten the accuracy of positioning results. Focusing on this deficiency, a tightly-coupled LiDAR inertial odometry, named PDLC-LIO, is developed in this paper towards large-scale environments with close loops. A direct point cloud registration approach without extracting features has been introduced into this framework. Strategies including the pre-integration on the Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU), the direct scan match in local-scale, and an efficient fusion loop closure detection method with conditional detection are included to guarantee the precision. Also, the factor graph optimization is considered, and measurements from LiDAR odometry, IMU and loop closures can thus be integrated into the back-end optimization. The proposed method has been verified on both the public datasets and the test cases collected by our own autonomous driving experiment platform. Accurate experimental results can be obtained. Such results show that the performance including accumulated errors and the drift phenomenon outperforms the state-of-the-art algorithms LeGO-LOAM/ LIO-SAM /FAST-LIO2, and the loop closure detection rate can be promoted up to 75%.	https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=10234608	0
Evaluation Framework for Electric Vehicle Security Risk Assessment	Electric Vehicles (EVs) seem promising for future transportation to solve environmental concerns and energy management problems. According to Reuters, global car makers plan to invest over half a billion in more efficient and intelligent EVs and batteries. However, there are several challenges in EV mass production, including cybersecurity. Due to the cyber-physical nature of EVs and charging stations, their security and trustworthiness are ongoing challenges. In this study, we identify gaps in the security profiling of EVs and categorize them into five components: 1) charging station security, 2) information privacy, 3) software security, 4) connected vehicle security, and 5) autonomous driving security. Our study provides a comprehensive analysis of identified vulnerabilities, threats, challenges and attacks for different EV security aspects, along with their possible surface/subsurface and countermeasures. We develop a comprehensive security risk assessment framework by first using EV security profiles and mapping identified vulnerabilities to a well-known threat model, STRIDE. Then, we classify the risk levels associated with each vulnerability by setting ground criteria for the impact and likelihood of the threats. Finally, we validate our risk assessment framework by applying the same criteria to eight real-world EV attack scenarios. As a result, researchers can adapt the proposed risk assessment framework to discover threats and assess their risks in EVs and charging station ecosystems.	https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=10247152	0
Pose and Shape Estimation of Humans in Vehicles	As autonomous driving technologies advance, occupants are expected to be free from driving, diversifying interaction scenarios with vehicles. Despite the growing importance of in-vehicle occupant monitoring systems, most existing systems focus on the face or head tracking of occupants, and only a few studies have attempted to detect their poses. In this paper, we present the first in-vehicle environment-specialized framework for the joint estimation of 3D human pose and shape from a single image. To this end, we introduce a new dataset called Human In VEhicles (HIVE), which contains a large collection of synthesized humans with different shapes and poses in vehicle images. HIVE provides RGB and NIR in-vehicle image pairs with ground-truth 2D and 3D pose and shape annotations, respectively. In addition, to exploit the different characteristics of humans in vehicles and unconstrained environments, we present a new pose prior penalizing poses that deviate from in-vehicle poses. The pose prior is derived using a variational autoencoder trained with in-vehicle human pose data. By using the proposed HIVE dataset and pose prior along with an elaborately designed two-stage training procedure, our method exhibits significantly improved pose and shape estimation performance compared with state-of-the-art methods for real-world test images captured in vehicles under different conditions.	https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=10229964	0
Stealthy Attack on Remote Control System With Local Controller and Its Countermeasures	Cyber–physical systems (CPSs) driven by a local controller and a remote controller have been gaining significant research interest in recent years due to its application scenarios in practice, such as unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs). In this article, we consider the security issue in the remote control system with a local controller under stealthy attacks. Under this framework, one controller is designed locally based on the limited measurements collected by a local sensor, and the other controller is designed remotely and is transmitted to the actuator through a wireless communication channel, which may suffer malicious attacks due to its openness. To defend attacks on remote control signal, the K–L divergence-based detector or  $\chi ^{2}$  detector is often adopted. However, there may be attackers adopting stealthy attacks, which can bypass such detectors. Therefore, we analyze the existence of such attacks, and analytically characterize the worst-estimation performance degradation induced by the remote control signal attack. Further, we construct the optimal attack signal to achieve the upper bound on the estimation performance degradation. In addition, we also give countermeasures against such stealthy attacks. Simulations are provided to illustrate the proposed results.	https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=10304192	0
Explosive Cyber Security Threats During COVID-19 Pandemic and a Novel Tree-Based Broad Learning System to Overcome	The rapid spread of the COVID-19 has not only affected personal health and economy, but also revolutionized people’s lifestyles. As more people turn to work and socialize online, the development of unmanned technologies based on the Internet of Vehicles (IoV), such as unmanned delivery, unmanned vehicles, unmanned transportation, etc., will become an inevitable trend. However, all kinds of intelligent terminals for unmanned equipment require a large amount of data interaction with devices such as cloud servers, mobile terminals, and roadside terminals, which poses cyber security risks. Furthermore, the outbreak of COVID-19 has prompted people to put forward higher demands for the security of network communications. Unfortunately, the current intrusion detection methods based on machine learning still have weaknesses such as low accuracy and low efficiency when faced with unbalanced data distribution. To solve the above problems, we propose a novel Tree-based BLS (TBLS) intrusion detection method according to the idea of ensemble learning and decision tree (CART and J48). The performance of TBLS was tested on the NSL-KDD dataset and the UNSW-NB15 dataset respectively, which contain a variety of malicious traffic types for attacks on the IoV. The results show that our proposed method can achieve higher accuracy rate and lower false alarm rate, compared with the existing 16 solutions.	https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9743968	0
Low-Rank Sparse Generative Adversarial Unsupervised Domain Adaptation for Multitarget Traffic Scene Semantic Segmentation	Semantic segmentation in diverse real-world traffic scenes is a challenging task for autonomous vehicles to have a reliable understanding of the outside environment. Although deep visual models show a remarkable performance on traffic scene segmentation, they need significant improvements when the source and target scene distributions are different. The weather and illumination differences between source and target datasets result in dramatic distribution shifts that degrade the target segmentation performance. This article develops an unsupervised domain adaptation (UDA) model to address complex domain shift problems where the dataset, weather, and illumination of source and target traffic scenes are different. We devise a sparse adversarial multitarget UDA approach to capture powerful domain-invariant features to segment traffic scenes in different conditions. First, a sparse representation of the source traffic scenes is captured via a new spectral low-rank dictionary learning technique in the latent space of a deep encoder–decoder segmentation architecture. The feature sparsity provides high generalization capacity for our deep feature extractor that enables us to compute complex visual patterns of source images. Then, the distribution of source sparse features is learned using a generative adversarial framework. Finally, the sparse representations of source and target scenes are aligned via a sparse domain-invariant feature extractor trained by min–max optimization. The aligned features serve as domain-invariant scene representations that can best describe both source and target scenes; hence providing deep domain adaptation for traffic scene semantic segmentation. Experiments on a real-world dataset indicate the superiority of the proposed model compared to the state-of-the-art methodologies.	https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=10193868	0
A Multilevel Electronic Control Unit Re-Encryption Scheme for Autonomous Vehicles	Electronic control units (ECUs) connected by a controller area network (CAN) are used to perform various functions in modern vehicles. In the latest autonomous vehicles, redundant ECUs and a backup bus (different from CAN) are always equipped to prevent a single point of failure or network attack. However, due to the lack of protection measures of CAN bus, attackers can remotely intrude into the vehicle. Many schemes have proposed to use encryption to solve the security problem of CAN bus. Considering the current ECU storage space is limited, it is impossible to store all ECUs’ keys. When a single point of failure or network attack against an ECU occurs, it is necessary for the backup ECU to process the messages related to the failed ECU. How to ensure that the backup ECU can decrypt the encrypted messages and at the same time securely isolates the backbone network from the backup network is an urgent issue to be solved. In order to solve the problem of forwarding and processing such messages under encryption conditions, we propose an efficient re-encryption scheme based on proxy re-encryption. The scheme is also suitable for cross-bus communication without backup networks. Burrows-Abadi-Needham (BAN) logic, random oracle model and Automated Validation of Internet Security Protocols and Applications (AVISPA) tool are utilized to prove that the scheme is secure. The scheme is simulated based on the MIRACL cryptography library on the computer and Raspberry Pi. The simulation results demonstrate that the proposed scheme is secure compared with the existing scheme.	https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=10247102	0
Multi-Sensors Space and Time Dimension Based Intrusion Detection System in Automated Vehicles	Recent developments in intelligence technologies have led to an explosion in the use of connected and automated vehicles (CAVs). Unfortunately, these autonomous vehicles face an increasing risk of vulnerability due to various attacks. Vehicle intrusion detection mechanisms are widely employed to mitigate the threats. Although some works have addressed this issue, few works consider situations that the attack detection may be fooled via simultaneous attacking multiple sensors. In this article, we propose a novel intrusion detection system integrated Space Dimension Model and Time Dimension Model based on sensor data fusion for countering both independent attack and confederate attack in automated vehicles. In Space Dimension Model, the correlations of multivariate in-vehicle sensor data among multiple sensors are utilized as the input of our optimized convolutional neural network (CNN) model. Especially, we construct vehicle state matrices to characterize the underlying correlation of data between each sensor and other sensors, and then input them into our network for classification. To describe the abrupt deviation caused by anomalous multivariate sensor data itself, we design Time Dimension Model to capture the sensor behaviors of vehicle state vectors at adjacent time by utilizing the Mahalanobis distance (MD) metric. Extensive empirical studies based on a real-world vehicular dataset demonstrate the effectiveness of our integrated anomaly detection mechanisms by a comparative analysis with two detection models that consider only Space Dimension and Time Dimension respectively. The method can outperform the related work under different scenarios 1) with the gain of up to 3.01% in accuracy and 3.04% in F1 score; 2) with ability of defending against confederate attack effectively.	https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=10224320	0
A Robust LiDAR-Camera Self-Calibration Via Rotation-Based Alignment and Multi-Level Cost Volume	Multi-sensor collaborative perception has been a significant trend in self-driving and robot navigation. The precondition for multi-sensor fusion is the accurate calibration between sensors. Traditional LiDAR-Camera calibrations rely on laborious manual operations. Several recent studies have demonstrated the advantages of convolutional neural networks regarding feature extraction capabilities. However, the vast modality discrepancy between RGB images and point clouds makes it difficult to explore corresponding features, remaining a challenge for LiDAR-Camera calibrations. In this letter, we propose a new robust online LiDAR-Camera self-calibration network (SCNet). To reduce the search dimensionality for feature matching, we exploit self-supervised learning to align RGB images with projected depth images in 2D pixel coordinates, thereby achieving pre-alignment of the roll angle. In addition, to generate more accurate initial similarity measures for RGB image pixels and possible corresponding projected depth image pixels, we propose a novel multi-level patch matching method that concatenates cost volume constructed from multi-level feature maps. Our method achieves a mean absolute calibration error of 0.724 cm in translation and 0.055$^{\circ }$ in rotation in a single frame analysis with miscalibration magnitudes of up to $\pm$1.5 m and $\pm 20^{\circ }$ on the KITTI odometry dataset, which demonstrates the superiority of our method.	https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=10328060	0
Extended Attribute Profiles for Precise Crop Classification in UAV-Borne Hyperspectral Imagery	Unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV)-borne hyperspectral imagery has been applied in precision agriculture, owing to its high spatial and spectral resolution. Specifically, the high spatial resolution is conducive to revealing the textural characteristics of crops, while the high spectral resolution can depict detailed spectral differences among crops. In this study, we explored the potential of extended attribute profiles (EAP) in modeling the spectral-spatial characteristics of UAV-borne hyperspectral imagery for the precise crop classification. Specifically, two dimensionality reduction approaches, namely, principle component analysis (PCA) and independent component analysis (ICA), were performed on the hyperspectral image to extract components, based on which a series of EAP that measure different image characteristics are generated. To exploit the complementary information of different attributes, the extracted EAP were fused for the classification of crops using feature stacking (FS) and decision fusion (DF) strategies. Meanwhile, random forest (RF), support vector machine (SVM), and deep neural networks (DNN) were used as classifier for the precise classification of crops. Experiments conducted on the WHU-Hi dataset demonstrated that EAP exploited the spectral-spatial information of UAV-borne hyperspectral imagery and obtained satisfactory crop classification performance.	https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=10378649	0
Chassis Global Dynamics-Oriented Trajectory Planning for Automated Vehicles	The trajectory planning module generates optimal collision-free paths, which is essential to automated driving. Existing approaches have focused on traffic flow situations and the geometrical feasibility of local trajectories. However, high nonlinearity of vehicle dynamics could cause handling instability or even severe accidents in cases of tracking dynamic infeasible paths. Meanwhile, the variety and complexity of driving environments bring intractable challenges to safe trajectory planning. This article aims to address this crucial issue and proposes a chassis global dynamics-oriented trajectory planning scheme. This work designs comprehensive performance indices to represent handling dynamic status based on chassis dynamics modeling. As the basis of trajectory planning, a reference path is extracted from global digital map data, and the curvilinear coordinate frame is exploited. Numerical optimization is proposed to solve the trajectory planning problem. Thus, an optimal and dynamically feasible trajectory, which satisfies geometrical smoothness, chassis global dynamics indices, and feasible safety, can be generated and transformed. Various scenarios are involved in carrying out simulation tests, and those results demonstrate the excellent capability and effectiveness of the proposed scheme to provide optimal trajectories in a variety of driving situations.	https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=10289710	0
Autonomous Vehicle Platoons in Urban Road Networks: A Joint Distributed Reinforcement Learning and Model Predictive Control Approach	In this paper, platoons of autonomous vehicles operating in urban road networks are considered. From a methodological point of view, the problem of interest consists of formally characterizing vehicle state trajectory tubes by means of routing decisions complying with traffic congestion criteria. To this end, a novel distributed control architecture is conceived by taking advantage of two methodologies: deep reinforcement learning and model predictive control. On one hand, the routing decisions are obtained by using a distributed reinforcement learning algorithm that exploits available traffic data at each road junction. On the other hand, a bank of model predictive controllers is in charge of computing the more adequate control action for each involved vehicle. Such tasks are here combined into a single framework: the deep reinforcement learning output (action) is translated into a set-point to be tracked by the model predictive controller; conversely, the current vehicle position, resulting from the application of the control move, is exploited by the deep reinforcement learning unit for improving its reliability. The main novelty of the proposed solution lies in its hybrid nature: on one hand it fully exploits deep reinforcement learning capabilities for decision-making purposes; on the other hand, time-varying hard constraints are always satisfied during the dynamical platoon evolution imposed by the computed routing decisions. To efficiently evaluate the performance of the proposed control architecture, a co-design procedure, involving the SUMO and MATLAB platforms, is implemented so that complex operating environments can be used, and the information coming from road maps (links, junctions, obstacles, semaphores, etc.) and vehicle state trajectories can be shared and exchanged. Finally by considering as operating scenario a real entire city block and a platoon of eleven vehicles described by double-integrator models, several simulations have been performed with the aim to put in light the main features of the proposed approach. Moreover, it is important to underline that in different operating scenarios the proposed reinforcement learning scheme is capable of significantly reducing traffic congestion phenomena when compared with well-reputed competitors.	https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=10400390	0
Privacy-Aware Remote Identification for Unmanned Aerial Vehicles: Current Solutions, Potential Threats, and Future Directions	The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) recently introduced a new standard, namely, remote identification, to improve accountability for unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) operations. This rule requires UAV operators to broadcast messages revealing sensitive data, such as identity and location on the wireless channel. However, this leads to security and privacy concerns among UAV operators. Unauthorized parties may easily discover the location and identity of a UAV flying in a specific area and launch attacks on it such as using wireless jamming or tracking its activity. This review investigates and systematizes the main weaknesses affecting the Remote ID capability required of modern UAVs, and the approaches through which attackers can exploit these weaknesses to disrupt safety and accountability. Moreover, this article analyzes current solutions that mitigate privacy issues associated with Remote ID. Finally, we identify multiple challenges that require to be addressed by both industry and academia, and we propose future research directions to improve the security and privacy of UAVs.	https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=10143727	0
Collaborative Honeypot Defense in UAV Networks: A Learning-Based Game Approach	The proliferation of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) opens up new opportunities for on-demand service provision anywhere and anytime, but also exposes UAVs to a variety of cyber threats. Low/medium interaction honeypots offer a promising lightweight defense for actively protecting mobile Internet of things, particularly UAV networks. While previous research has primarily focused on honeypot system design and attack pattern recognition, the incentive issue for motivating UAVs’ participation (e.g., sharing trapped attack data in honeypots) to collaboratively resist distributed and sophisticated attacks remains unexplored. This paper proposes a novel game-theoretical collaborative defense approach to address optimal, fair, and feasible incentive design, in the presence of network dynamics and UAVs’ multi-dimensional private information (e.g., valid defense data (VDD) volume, communication delay, and UAV cost). Specifically, we first develop a honeypot game between UAVs and the network operator under both partial and complete information asymmetry scenarios. The optimal VDD-reward contract design problem with partial information asymmetry is then solved using a contract-theoretic approach that ensures budget feasibility, truthfulness, fairness, and computational efficiency. In addition, under complete information asymmetry, we devise a distributed reinforcement learning algorithm to dynamically design optimal contracts for distinct types of UAVs in the time-varying UAV network. Extensive simulations demonstrate that the proposed scheme can motivate UAV’s cooperation in VDD sharing and improve defensive effectiveness, compared with conventional schemes.	https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=10273619	0
An Efficient Self-Evolution Method of Autonomous Driving for Any Given Algorithm	Autonomous vehicles are expected to achieve self-evolution in the real-world environment to gradually cover more complex and changing scenarios. Reinforcement learning focuses on how agents act in the environment to maximize the cumulative reward, with a great potential to achieve self-evolution ability. However, most of reinforcement learning algorithms suffer from a low sample efficiency, which greatly limits their application in autonomous driving. This paper presents an efficient self-evolution method for any given algorithm based on the combination of Soft Actor Critic (SAC) and Behavioral Cloning(BC). First, the states of the sample trajectory in the replay buffer are separated and input into the given algorithm (algorithm with fundamental performance) to get the output label of actions such that the SAC algorithm can be guided using BC to achieve fast iteration in the direction of optimization with existing basic performance. Then, the value iteration algorithm is combined to achieve the proportion allocation of mixed gradient feedback, in order to trade off exploitation and exploration. In addition, the proposed methodology is evaluated in simulation environment taking automated speed control as an example. Experiment results show that compared with SAC algorithm, the proposed method can realize more than three times of convergence efficiency improvement, while without destroying the exploration enhancement advantage of reinforcement learning algorithm, that is, the performance is improved by 20% compared with the given algorithm (Intelligent Driver Model, IDM). The proposed method can easily extended to improve any given model no matter it is model-based or learning-based algorithm.	https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=10239250	0
Deep Attention Recognition for Attack Identification in 5G UAV Scenarios: Novel Architecture and End-to-End Evaluation	Despite the robust security features inherent in the 5G framework, attackers will still discover ways to disrupt 5G unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) operations and decrease UAV control communication performance in Air-to-Ground (A2G) links. Operating under the assumption that the 5G UAV communications infrastructure will never be entirely secure, we propose Deep Attention Recognition (DAtR) as a solution to identify attacks based on a small deep network embedded in authenticated UAVs. Our proposed solution uses two observable parameters: the Signal to Interference plus Noise Ratio (SINR) and the Received Signal Strength Indicator (RSSI) to recognize attacks under Line-of-Sight (LoS), Non-Line-of-Sight (NLoS), and a probabilistic combination of the two conditions. Several attackers are located in random positions in the tested scenarios, while their power varies between simulations. Moreover, terrestrial users are included in the network to impose additional complexity on attack detection. Additionally to the application and deep network architecture, our work innovates by mixing both observable parameters inside DAtR and adding two new pre-processing and post-processing techniques embedded in the deep network results to improve accuracy. We compare several performance parameters in our proposed Deep Network. For example, the impact of Long Short-Term-Memory (LSTM) and Attention layers in terms of their overall accuracy, the window size effect, and test the accuracy when only partial data is available in the training process. Finally, we benchmark our deep network with six widely used classifiers regarding classification accuracy. The eXtreme Gradient Boosting (XGB) outperforms all other algorithms in the deep network, for instance, the three top scoring algorithms: Random Forest (RF), CatBoost (CAT), and XGB obtain mean accuracy of 83.24 %, 85.60 %, and 86.33% in LoS conditions, respectively. When compared to XGB, our algorithm improves accuracy by more than 4% in the LoS condition (90.80% with Method 2) and by around 3% in the short-distance NLoS condition (83.07% with Method 1).	https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=10210056	0
Joint Optimization for Covert Communications in UAV-Assisted NOMA Networks	In this article, we investigate the design of the trajectory of an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) and the transmit power of ground users to improve covert communications against a flying warden in UAV-assisted non-orthogonal multiple access networks, where the legitimate UAV can simultaneously collect the messages from the multiple ground users in a secure manner. Taking the channel uncertainty into account, we derive the analytical expressions of the optimal normalized detection threshold, the minimum detection error probability (DEP), and the security-guaranteed transmit power constraint for the ground users that are exploited to ensure a high DEP at the warden UAV. Subsequently, the design to maximize the average covert achievable rate (CAR) subject to the constraints of flight speed, initial and final locations, transmit power, and detection performance is formulated as a non-convex optimization problem. To obtain a high-quality solution to the design problem at hand, an iterative block coordinate descent-based successive convex approximation method is proposed. From the theoretical analysis, we find that a greater channel estimation uncertainly or a lower effective received power ratio at the warden UAV is beneficial in enhancing the system covertness towards the warden UAV. Moreover, when the successful detection probability of the warden UAV is sufficiently small, the maximum effective received power ratio is linearly and positively correlated to the detection success probability. Besides, extensive simulations are presented to verify the covert performance advantages brought by the proposed method.	https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=10230898	0
B-UAVM: A Blockchain-Supported Secure Multi-UAV Task Management Scheme	The advent of unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) swarm technology brings possibilities to help humans complete tasks in no man’s land, such as deserts and rainforests. However, UAV network faces many cyber threats, where attackers can impersonate legitimate entities or tamper with UAV task data. For identity security, most of the existing methods use centralized authentication schemes, which have a single point of failure problem. For data security, the existing methods only secure the task data in the ground system, ignoring the data security in the air network. Therefore, the existing methods are not suitable for ubiquitous UAV scenarios. Blockchain secures data security while eliminating the single point of failure problem, and has been widely used in distributed scenarios. In this article, to secure entity identity and task data, we propose a blockchain-supported secure multi-UAV task management scheme (B-UAVM). Specifically, a three-layer blockchain structure is constructed to secure multitasks, and achieve ubiquitous control of UAV formations. Besides, six types of blocks and three types of transactions are designed to achieve safe processing and storage of task data and entity information. Furthermore, an improved practical byzantine fault tolerance (IPBFT) consensus mechanism and a UAV-formation-action-considered ground station consensus mechanism (UFAGS) are introduced in the Server Network and Ground Control Network, respectively, to accelerate the consensus. The experimental results show that the number of transactions generated per second (TPS) of B-UAVM is about  $0.5\times $  and  $3.7\times $  of the existing method when the block size or the number of blockchain nodes increases, respectively.	https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=10136399	0
Lightweight Blockchain-Based Secure Spectrum Sharing in Space–Air–Ground-Integrated IoT Network	Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) will be widely deployed due to their flexibility, mobility, and miniaturization, providing the necessary support for spectrum sharing between different communication systems in the space–air–ground-integrated IoT network (SAGIN). However, there are potential security threats to spectrum sharing among different communication systems due to the openness of a wireless network, the unreliability of node behavior, and the trust barriers of the networks. In this article, a secure spectrum sharing scheme based on lightweight UAV-blockchain (LUBC) is proposed to address the above security issues. First, a spectrum sharing model based on the overlay mode is developed to improve the spectrum efficiency of SAGIN, where UAVs relay signals from the satellite to the ground users in exchange for spectrum access opportunities and serve their own users simultaneously in the nonorthogonal multiple access (NOMA) mode. Second, a secure spectrum sharing framework based on LUBC is proposed to solve the security and privacy issues of spectrum trading in SAGIN. Then, aiming at maximizing the primary user’s throughput under the premise of meeting the minimum power allocation factor of UAV network, the spectrum auction based on NOMA is formulated as a multirelay selection optimization problem, which is solved by the blockchain-based sequential Vickrey auction mechanism. Finally, the security evaluation and numerical results are conducted to verify the security and effectiveness of the proposed spectrum sharing scheme for SAGIN.	https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=10159001	0
IRS-Assisted Anti-Jamming Transmission for an Integrated Satellite-UAV-Terrestrial Network With Imperfect CSI: A Game-Based Perspective	In this article, an intelligent reflecting surface (IRS)-assisted integrated satellite-unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV)-terrestrial (SUT) Internet of Things (IoT) network faced with a smart jammer under imperfect channel state information (CSI) conditions is considered. We propose a Stackelberg game model to describe the adversarial relationship between the satellite, UAV, and IRS and the jammer, which are modeled as the leader and the follower, respectively. For the follower subgame, the jammer aims to minimize the jamming power while guaranteeing that the jamming energy efficiency surpasses a certain threshold. Under this setup, the Angle of Arrival (AoA)-based discretization method is utilized to address the imperfect CSI issue. Then, the use-and-then-forget method and the Lagrangian function are employed to obtain a closed-form expression for the jammer’s power. Finally, a feasible jamming power solution is obtained by means of the Cauchy–Schwarz inequality. For the leader subgame, we aim to optimize the hybrid beamforming design of the satellite, UAV and IRS, with the goal of minimizing the total transmit power, while guaranteeing that the downlink received signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR) surpasses the minimum communication threshold. We propose an alternating optimization scheme, in which the Cauchy–Schwarz inequality, the AoA-based discretization method, and nonsmooth penalty functions are employed to alternately obtain the optimal satellite beamforming vector, UAV beamforming vector and IRS phase matrix when the other variables are fixed. Through our analytical and numerical results, the proposed beamforming scheme achieves a reduction of 16.9% in average power consumption compared with other benchmark schemes when obtaining the same anti-jamming performance.	https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=10149096	0
Smart Optimization Solution for Channel Access Attack Defense Under UAV-Aided Heterogeneous Network	6G-based wireless communication system is poised to redefine the next-generation network landscape by enabling novel services and applications, such as intelligent link establishment, power control, data collection, transmission, and distribution. However, security issues, particularly recently revealed channel access attack (CAA), present significant challenges to performance optimization tasks in the heterogeneous wireless networks of 6G, namely, Age of Information (AoI) oriented Network (AoN), Throughput oriented Network (ToN), and Latency oriented Network (LoN). To address these challenges, this article presents a game theory-based smart optimization solution to enable unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV) to resist CAA within a 6G-based heterogeneous network. Our methodology begins by outlining the advantages and challenges associated with UAV usage, followed by the design of performance indicators and intelligent resource allocation schemes under the influence of CAA. Subsequently, we introduce definitions and categories within game theory, encompassing the concept and equilibrium of three typical game models. The efficacy of our proposed framework is validated through simulation results, which demonstrate the achievement of optimal AoI, enhanced throughput, and reduced latency compared with baseline methodologies when countering CAA in a UAV-assisted heterogeneous network.	https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=10142004	0
Energy-Efficient General PoI-Visiting by UAV With a Practical Flight Energy Model	Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) are being widely exploited for various applications, e.g., traversing to collect data from ground sensors, patrolling to monitor key facilities, moving to aid mobile edge computing. We summarize these UAV applications and formulate a problem, namely the general waypoint-based PoI-visiting problem. Since energy is critical due to the limited onboard storage capacity, we aim at minimizing flight energy consumption. In our problem, we pay special attention to the energy consumption for turning and switching operations on flight planning, which are usually ignored in the literature but play an important role in practical UAV flights according to our real-world measurement experiments. We propose specially designed graph parts to model the turning and switching cost and thus transfer the problem into a classic graph problem, i.e., general traveling salesman problem, which can be efficiently solved. Theoretical analysis shows that such problem transformation has the graph redefinition approximation ratio upper bound, $max\lbrace \Theta /\delta,2\rbrace$max{Θ/δ,2}, where $\Theta$Θ is related to the designed graph parts and $\delta$δ is a constant. Finally, we evaluate our proposed algorithm by simulations. The results show that it costs less than 107% of the optimal minimum energy consumption for small scale problems and costs only 50% as much energy as a naive algorithm for large scale problems.	https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9858609	0
Optimization of a Secure UAV-Based IoT: RF-Fingerprint Authentication and Resource Allocation	Unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) technology has been developed to establish a mobile-edge computing (MEC) network for the Internet of Things (IoT). In the MEC network, users can reduce their latency by communicating and exchanging data with UAV-based edge servers. Security is a critical issue in a UAV-based IoT since the attackers who attempt to access the network may cause interference and influence the flight of the UAV. In this article, we propose a lightweight RF fingerprinting recognition method in consideration of the limited computing power in UAVs, identifying unauthenticated attackers and refusing their access to IoT. Also, we propose a resource allocation scheme in the secure UAV-based MEC network. By establishing a nonconvex resource optimization problem and decomposing it into a few tractable subproblems, we offer a numerical algorithm for the optimum resource allocation. The analysis results illustrate that our proposed method can reduce energy consumption and running time compared to its benchmark methods.	https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=10138659	0
GoComfort: Comfortable Navigation for Autonomous Vehicles Leveraging High-Precision Road Damage Crowdsensing	Recent years have witnessed rapid advances in autonomous driving technologies. Autonomous vehicles are more likely to be accepted if they drive comfortably to avoid potholes, bumps, and other road damage conditions, especially when there are elderly and disabled passengers on board. Traditionally, sensing road damage conditions is either labor-intensive by field investigation and reporting, or inaccurate by surveillance cameras and driving recorders due to limited perspective. In this paper, we propose GoComfort, a crowdsensing-based framework to provide low-cost and fine-grained comfortable navigation for autonomous vehicles with road damage identification leveraging high-precision road sensing data. First, we propose to exploit city-wide autonomous vehicle fleets as crowdsensing participants, and employ an edge-cloud-hybrid computing paradigm to efficiently collect high-precision road damage-related data, including 3D LiDAR point clouds and street view images. Second, we design an accurate road damage identification model fusing spatial structures of point clouds and texture features of street view images, and use an active learning-based method to address the sparse labels issue. Finally, we devise two comfortable navigation scenarios, i.e., fine-grained road damage avoidance and coarse-grained city-wide navigation, and propose a hierarchical road damage assessment diagram for comfortable route planning. Experiments using real-world road sensing data in Xiamen, China show that our approach identifies road damage conditions with an accuracy of 87.5%, and achieves a user acceptance rate of 93.8% in riding comfort evaluation, outperforming the state-of-the-art baselines.	https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9861719	0
μTesla-Based Authentication for Reliable and Secure Broadcast Communications in IoD Using Blockchain	The Internet of Drones (IoD) manages and coordinates communications between drones in Internet of Things (IoT) applications. Ensuring security and privacy in unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) networks, i.e., drones, is essential to protect data from cyber attacks. In this context, providing authentication is a major challenge due to the fact that drones are devices limited in power capabilities. The problem is aggravated by the dynamism of IoD networks due to the high mobility of drones, being sensitive to packet loss and handovers. Blockchain technology is attractive to address the problem of centralization of existing authentication protocols. In this article, we provide a decentralized, secure, and efficient authentication protocol, based on  $\mu $ Tesla, that relies on Blockchain to manage drone authentication. We analyze the security and performance of the proposed solution. Simulation results show that the proposed solution outperforms several approaches in the literature, achieving an authentication delay of less than 250 ms with a low information exchange of 1024 bits for 128-bit security level while maintaining low computational requirements.	https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=10136840	0
UAV Path Planning for Target Coverage Task in Dynamic Environment	Exploiting the possibility of an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) as a powerful tool for the Internet of Things applications, such as intelligent agricultural monitoring, intelligent transportation monitoring, etc., has gradually become a hot research topic at home and abroad. While some optimization algorithms have been devised to plan the flight route of UAVs, there are still some problems with the feasibility and effectiveness of these algorithms. This article presents a solution to the UAV path planning problem for target coverage task in a dynamic environment. The methodology applies a greedy allocation strategy for task assignment and an improved ant colony optimization algorithm based on variable pheromone (ACO-VP) for path planning. First, we specify the optimal number of UAVs for the task and allocate target points to each UAV, through the greedy allocation strategy. Then, to improve the efficiency of path planning, we adjust the pheromone update rule by introducing a variable pheromone enhancement factor and a variable pheromone evaporation coefficient into the ant colony optimization (ACO) algorithm. Moreover, paths are replanned when the coverage task changes due to the increase of new target points. This method is verified through simulations and compared with other algorithms. The results show that the ACO-VP algorithm is more efficient and effective for UAV path planning than others.	https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=10130088	0
Trustworthy Sensor Fusion Against Inaudible Command Attacks in Advanced Driver-Assistance Systems	There are increasing concerns about malicious attacks on autonomous vehicles. In particular, inaudible voice command attacks pose a significant threat as voice commands become available in autonomous driving systems. How to empirically defend against these inaudible attacks remains an open question. Previous research investigates utilizing deep learning-based multimodal fusion for defense, without considering the model uncertainty in trustworthiness. As deep learning has been applied to increasingly sensitive tasks, uncertainty measurement is crucial in helping improve model robustness, especially in mission-critical scenarios. In this article, we propose the multimodal fusion framework (MFF) as an intelligent security system to defend against inaudible voice command attacks. MFF fuses heterogeneous audio–vision modalities using VGG family neural networks and achieves the detection accuracy of 92.25% in the comparative fusion method empirical study. Additionally, extensive experiments on audio–vision tasks reveal the model’s uncertainty. Using expected calibration errors, we measure calibration errors and Monte Carlo Dropout to estimate the predictive distribution for the proposed models. Our findings show empirically to train robust multimodal models, improve standard accuracy and provide a further step toward interpretability. Finally, we discuss the pros and cons of our approach and its applicability for advanced driver assistance systems.	https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=10128967	0
Unmanned-Aerial-Vehicle-Aided Integrated Sensing and Computation With Mobile-Edge Computing	Integrated sensing and communication (ISAC), which enables the joint radar sensing and data communications, shows its great potential in many intelligent applications. In this article, we investigate the unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV)-aided ISAC with mobile-edge computing (MEC), where the ISAC device deployed on the UAV senses multiple targets with the sensing scheduling and offloads the radar sensing data to the edge-server to train a machine learning model for target recognition. The radar estimation information rate is utilized to measure the radar sensing performance. We aim to minimize a systemwise cost that includes both the UAV’s energy consumption and the data collecting time, while satisfying the requirements on both the model training error and the radar sensing performance. We formulate a joint optimization problem of the sensing scheduling, the number of time-slots, the sensing power, the communication power, and the UAV trajectory. Despite the strict nonconvexity of the formulated problem, we propose an efficient algorithm for solving it. Our algorithm jointly leverages the vertical decomposition that exploits the layered structure of the formulated problem and the horizontal decomposition that utilizes the block coordinate descent (BCD) method. Numerical results are presented to validate the effectiveness of our proposed algorithms and show the performance gain of our proposed scheme.	https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=10107972	0
UAV Target Detection for IoT via Enhancing ERP Component by Brain–Computer Interface System	The increasing popularity of Internet of Things (IoT) devices provides a huge data source for intelligent identification. Images captured by the unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) are often exploited in target detection missions for search, rescue and fire prevention. However, without sufficient training samples, the machine learning method is usually difficult to meet application requirements. To solve the problem, a brain–computer interface (BCI) real-time system is applied to UAV target detection. In this study, a novel rapid serial visual presentation (RSVP) paradigm was formulated to present images, enhancing the ability for wide-area target detection. Since there is spatial correlation in captured images, joint decision for identical target can improve the recognition efficiency. To suppress interfering components and improve event-related potential (ERP) detection efficiency, an enhancing ERP component (EEC) algorithm is proposed. Both decision method and EEC algorithm are based on strictly statistical theory. RSVP task was performed by 12 subjects. The interference components and noise correlation were significantly reduced by the EEC algorithm. The target detection rate online was 86.6% while the false alarm rate was less than 5%. Besides, the joint decision strategy raised the area under curve (AUC) value from 0.876 to 0.963. The proposed BCI real-time system realizes the complementarity of human intelligence and IoT, ushering UAV target detection into the era of hybrid intelligence.	https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=10115453	0
Towards a Secure and Computational Framework for Internet of Drones Enabled Aerial Computing	In Internet of Drones (IoD), unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) or drones are deployed in various mission-critical applications to collect sensitive data and disseminate it to the server placed on the ground station. Users mostly require real-time data from the drones, instead of the information stored by the server, in specific applications to perform timely actions. However, performing real-time communication with a drone through the public communication channel, which is exposed to different security risks, mandates an authenticated key exchange (AKE) between users and drones in the IoD networks for enabling users to communicate securely with the drone through the public communication infrastructure. Moreover, real-time data acquisition from drones brings about computational overheads, making the process computationally inefficient. Thus, an efficient and lightweight AKE scheme is imperative. This article proposes a resource-efficient authentication scheme for the IoD networks, called REAS-IoD, which utilizes the lightweight hash function and authenticated encryption primitive, known as ACE, to accomplish the AKE process securely. In REAS-IoD, a user’s authentication is performed, followed by establishing a secure session key (SK) between a specific drone and the user, for the future encrypted communication. The SK’s security is established utilizing a random oracle model. We, by performing informal security verification, prove that REAS-IoD is cable of obviating different active and passive pernicious security attacks. Besides, we conduct a Scyther tool-based analysis of REAS-IoD to corroborate its security strength. Lastly, a comparative study is presented to demonstrate that without compromising security and privacy features, REAS-IoD requires fewer resource, and is computationally efficient, than the related eminent security schemes.	https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9714144	0
All-Day Object Tracking for Unmanned Aerial Vehicle	Unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) has facilitated a wide range of real-world applications and attracted extensive research in the mobile computing field. Specially, developing real-time robust visual onboard trackers for all-day aerial maneuver can remarkably broaden the scope of intelligent deployment of UAV. However, prior tracking methods have merely focused on robust tracking in the well-illuminated scenes, while ignoring trackers’ capabilities to be deployed in the dark. In darkness, the conditions can be more complex and harsh, easily posing inferior robust tracking or even tracking failure. To this end, this work proposes a novel discriminative correlation filter-based tracker with illumination adaptive and anti-dark capability, namely ADTrack. ADTrack firstly exploits image illuminance information to enable adaptability of the model to the given light condition. Then, by virtue of an efficient enhancer, ADTrack carries out image pretreatment where a target aware mask is generated. Benefiting from the mask, ADTrack aims to solve a novel dual regression problem where dual filters are online trained with mutual constraint. Besides, this work also constructs a UAV nighttime tracking benchmark UAVDark135. Exhaustive experiments on authoritative benchmarks and onboard tests are implemented to validate the superiority and robustness of ADTrack in all-day conditions.	https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9744417	0
Secrecy Rate Maximization by Cooperative Jamming for UAV-Enabled Relay System With Mobile Nodes	In recent years, unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) have been widely used in wireless communications due to their low cost, small size, flexible deployment, and mobile controllability. However, because of the Line-of-Sight (LoS) communication links, the security threat is always a challenging problem to deal with. In particular, information stolen and leakage may happen in the presence of eavesdroppers. This article proposes a UAV-enabled system with a relay UAV and a jammer UAV, and certain mobile source and destination nodes in the presence of an eavesdropper to solve the secrecy rate maximization problem. In this system, the relay UAV transmits information between pairs of moving source nodes and moving destination nodes with interrupted communication channels due to blockage or long distance, and the jammer UAV interferes with eavesdropper to reduce the milked information through sending jamming signals. We establish an average secrecy rate maximization problem with trajectory and transmit power optimization under certain constraints for this system. Since this problem is nonconvex and reformulated as the Markov decision process (MDP), we use deep reinforcement learning (DRL) method to solve it. In this article, we adopt a proximal policy optimization (PPO) algorithm to find an optimal solution because it can deal with the model of continuous action space. According to our defined states, rewards, and actions in this specified MDP, this algorithm can autonomously learn to optimize the trajectory and power allocation of the UAVs to realize our goal. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed PPO-based average secrecy rate maximization algorithm is valid, effective and scalable.	https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=10087301	0
Sybil Attack Detection in Internet of Flying Things-IoFT: A Machine Learning Approach	Sybil attack refers to the situation when a malicious node falsely claims to have numerous identities and is known to be one of the security threats to the Internet of Things (IoT). Due to recent increase usage of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) in various applications, Sybil attack has been identified as a threat to the flying ad hoc network (FANET) paradigm and its integration with the IoT to form the Internet of Flying Things (IoFT). In this article, we propose an intelligent Sybil attack detection approach for FANETs-based IoFT using physical layer characteristics of the radio signals emitted from the UAVs as detected by two ground nodes. A supervised machine learning approach is employed and experimented with several different classifiers available in the Weka workbench platform. The experiment was carried out based on two features of the radio signals, namely, the received signal strength difference (RSSD) and the Time Difference of Arrival (TDoA). Simulation results revealed that the proposed scheme can achieve a high correct classification accuracy of above 91% on average, even for smart malicious nodes with power control capability operating at power levels not directly trained. In addition to its high performance, the proposed scheme is also less susceptible to various attacks commonly carried out on the upper layers, such as data spoofing, due to the use of only intrinsically generated physical layer data. Furthermore, no additional communications overheads of the UAV nodes are required for the functionality of this scheme.	https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=10073944	0
Noncooperative and Cooperative Urban Intelligent Systems: Joint Logistic and Charging Incentive Mechanisms	Autonomous vehicles (AVs) have become an emerging crucial component of the intelligent transportation system (ITS) in modern smart cities. In particular, coordinated operations of AVs can potentially enhance the quality of public services, e.g., logistic and AV charging services. However, the joint logistic and AV charging scenario involves the sophisticated interactions between a large number of complicated agents, dynamic logistics, and electricity prices in real-world systems. Since AVs are individuals owned by different parties, the design of attractive incentive to motivate them to provide multiple public services becomes a fundamental issue. In this article, we develop an urban intelligent system (UIS) by exploiting the efficient incentive mechanisms, e.g., noncooperative and cooperative game-theoretic approaches, to motivate the AVs to provide logistic and charging services in UIS. For the noncooperative game approach, we formulate the interaction between the selfish AVs and the aggregator as a Stackelberg game. Meanwhile, the aggregator, known as the leader in the game, aims to decide the logistic and electricity trading prices, and then the AVs, executed as the followers, determine their service schedules. Furthermore, considering that all the players are willing to cooperate, we develop a cooperative potential game for the selfless AVs to maximize the social welfare of the UIS. These case studies demonstrate the effectiveness and practicability of proposed incentive mechanisms that can motivate EVs to provide high-quality logistic and charging services by maximizing their utilities. Also, both the proposed schemes provide significant system revenues than that of conventional system optimization-based approaches.	https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=10044214	0
Positioning and Contour Extraction of Autonomous Vehicles Based on Enhanced DOA Estimation by Large-Scale Arrays	As an important branch of Internet of Vehicles (IoV) systems, autonomous vehicle (AV) positioning based on direction-of-arrival (DOA) estimation has received extensive attention in recent years. In this article, an AV positioning method under unknown mutual coupling is proposed within the framework of a large-dimensional asymptotic theory (LAT). First, enhanced and closed-form DOA estimation is achieved by jointly exploiting large-scale uniform linear arrays (ULAs), Toeplitz rectification and the phase transformation result associated with the sample covariance matrix; second, a more reliable subset/set of DOAs is constructed according to the signal-to-noise at receivers; finally, robust AV positioning is achieved with the reliable subset/set. Motivated by satisfactory DOA estimation performance, an AV contour extraction scheme is developed with the aid of two antennas installed on an AV. The proposed method shows several salient advantages compared with existing methods, including improved resolution and accuracy, reduced computational complexity, robustness to mutual coupling and unreasonable DOA estimates, as well as the ability to effectively extract AV contour information.	https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=10044148	0
AUV-Assisted Stratified Source Location Privacy Protection Scheme Based on Network Coding in UASNs	The position of the source is sensitive and critical information in underwater acoustic sensor networks (UASNs). In this study, a network coding-based scheme called the stratified source location privacy protection scheme (SSLP-NC) with autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV) is suggested for a strong adversary that can decode data. First, for the adversary with passive attacks, several fake source selection algorithms are suggested for two circumstances where the source is in the shallow and deep sea, respectively. Each node then utilizes a pseudo-random number generator to create sequences on a regular basis so that the key data can be delivered to the sink without interference. Then, for the adversary with the active attack, the node encrypts the source and fake data using the pre-existing pseudo-random number sequence as an encoding vector to thwart the adversary’s decryption. Further, this work develops a relay node selection approach for transmitting the encoded data, which increases the variety of the data transmission pathways. Finally, this study includes a hole avoidance strategy that uses nodes or an AUV to address the potential hole issue. The simulation demonstrates that the SSLP-NC successfully fends off an adversary that can decode data packets, and performs better than the EECOR and DBR-MAC algorithms in terms of network safe time and packet delivery rate.	https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=10026869	0
A2RID—Anonymous Direct Authentication and Remote Identification of Commercial Drones	The recent worldwide introduction of RemoteID (RID) regulations forces all unmanned aircrafts (UAs), also known as drones, to broadcast in plaintext on the wireless channel their identity and real-time location, for accounting and monitoring purposes. Although improving drones’ monitoring and situational awareness, the RID rule also generates significant privacy concerns for UAs’ operators, threatened by the ease of tracking of UAs and related confidentiality and privacy concerns connected with the broadcasting of plaintext identity information. In this article, we propose anonymous direct authentication and remote identification ( $A^{2}RID$ ), a protocol suite for  $A^{2}RID$  of heterogeneous commercial UAs.  $A^{2}RID$  integrates and adapts protocols for anonymous message signing to work in the UA domain, coping with the constraints of commercial drones and the tight real-time requirements imposed by the RID regulation. Overall, the protocols in the  $A^{2}RID$  suite allow a UA manufacturer to pick the configuration that best suits the capabilities and constraints of the drone, i.e., either a processing-intensive but memory-lightweight solution (namely,  $CS-A^{2}RID$ ) or a computationally friendly but memory-hungry approach (namely,  $DS-A^{2}RID$ ). Besides formally defining the protocols and formally proving their security in our setting, we also implement and test them on real heterogeneous hardware platforms, i.e., the Holybro X-500 and the ESPcopter, releasing open-source the produced code. For all the protocols, we demonstrated experimentally the capability of generating anonymous RemoteID messages well below the time bound of 1 s required by RID, while at the same time having quite a limited impact on the energy budget of the drone.	https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=10029376	0
Dependency Tasks Offloading and Communication Resource Allocation in Collaborative UAV Networks: A Metaheuristic Approach	Nowadays, unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs)-assisted mobile-edge computing (MEC) systems have been exploited as a promising solution for providing computation services to mobile users outside of terrestrial networks. However, it remains challenging for standalone UAVs to meet the computation requirement of numerous users due to their limited computation capacity and battery lives. Therefore, we propose a collaborative scheme among UAVs to share the workload between them. Furthermore, this work is the first to consider the task topology of offloading in MEC-enabled UAVs networks while restricting their power consumption. We study the task topology, in which a task consists of a set of subtasks, and each subtask has dependencies upon other subtasks. In the real world, subtasks with dependencies must wait for their preceding subtasks to complete before being executed, and this affects the offloading strategy. Next, we formulate an optimization problem to minimize the average latency of users by jointly controlling the offloading decision for dependent tasks and allocating the communication resources of UAVs. The formulated problem is NP-hard and cannot be solved in polynomial time. Therefore, we divide the problem into two subproblems: 1) offloading decision problem and 2) communication resource allocation problem. Then, a metaheuristic method is proposed to find the suboptimal solution to the former problem, while the latter problem is solved by using convex optimization. Finally, we conduct simulation experiments to prove that our proposed offloading technique outperforms several benchmark schemes in minimizing the average latency of users for dependency tasks and achieving higher uplink transmission rates.	https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=10004947	0
Spatial-Temporal Modeling and Analysis of Reliability and Delay in Urban V2X Networks	The fifth-generation (5G) based vehicle-to-everything (V2X) communication is a promising technology to enhance both manned and unmanned driving systems. To this end, the 5G V2X networks should satisfy stringent requirements on transmission reliability and delay for exchanging safety-critical messages (SCMs). A joint analysis of transmission reliability and delay in V2X communication networks is thus crucial, particularly in urban 5G V2X networks. This was considered prohibitive due to the complicated spatial-temporal dynamics of V2X communications caused by interference, channel fading, as well as queueing and retransmission of SCMs. Moreover, urban 5G V2X networks are typically deployed in a finite area, where locations of nodes are spatially correlated and cannot be conveniently modeled as Poisson point process (PPP). In this paper, we propose a novel binomial point process (BPP) based analytic framework for modeling the spatial-temporal dynamics of urban 5G V2X communications and characterizing transmission reliability and delay of SCM exchange jointly. The presented framework captures not only the spatial distribution of interference and channel fading during uplink and downlink transmissions, but also the temporal dynamics associated with queueing and retransmissions of SCMs. Exploiting the stochastic geometry theory and queueing theory, closed-form expressions of transmission reliability and delay are derived, which are further validated using Monte Carlo simulations. Both the numerical and simulation results reveal complicated couplings between the transmission reliability and delay in different operation regimes. Nevertheless, the proposed analytical framework can accurately capture the reliability-delay relations.	https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=10006403	0
Wireless Distributed Consensus for Connected Autonomous Systems	Connected critical autonomous systems (C-CASs) are envisioned to significantly change our life and work styles through emerging vertical applications, such as autonomous vehicles and cooperative robots. However, as the scale of the connected nodes continues to grow, their heterogeneity and cybersecurity threats are more eminent, and conventional centralized communications and decision-making methodology are reaching their limit. This article is the first exploration of a trustworthy and fault-tolerant framework for C-CAS for achieving hyperreliable global decision making in a trustless environment, where the connected sensors/nodes are less reliable due to either communication failure or local decision error (e.g., by sensing algorithm/AI, etc.). The proposed framework is based on two iconic distributed consensus (DC) mechanisms: 1) practical Byzantine fault tolerance (PBFT) and 2) Raft, under the proposed perception-initiative-consensus-action (PICA) protocol with wireless connections among the nodes. We first analytically derived consensus reliability in six different system models. The other fundamental performance metrics, such as the consensus throughput and latency, node scalability, and reliability gain are also analytically derived. These analytical results provide basic design guidelines for wireless DC (WDC) usage in the C-CAS systems. The results show that WDC significantly improves overall system reliability with the increasing number of participating nodes.	https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9990047	0
A Hybrid Deep Sensor Anomaly Detection for Autonomous Vehicles in 6G-V2X Environment	Autonomous Vehicles (AVs) exchange real-time and seamless data between other AVs and the network, thus revolutionizing the Intelligent Transportation System (ITS). Automated transportation brings numerous benefits to human beings. However, the concerns such as safety, security, and privacy keep rising. In navigation and trajectory planning, the AVs require exchanging sensory information from their own and other AVs. In such cases, when a malicious AV or faulty sensor-equipped AV comes into connectivity, it can have disruptive consequences. This paper proposes a Hybrid Deep Anomaly Detection (HDAD) approach for effective anomaly detection and cyber-attack mitigation in AVs. The Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL) algorithm in HDAD approach acts over the 6G network to combat new-age cyber-attacks and provide a swift and accurate anomaly detection mechanism. In conjunction with Maximum Entropy Inverse Reinforcement Learning (MaxEntIRL), the HDAD approach identifies and isolates malicious AVs. It is envisioned that the obtained results prove the effectiveness of HDAD and have an 8.2% higher accuracy rate than the existing systems.	https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9815151	0
Pistis: Replay Attack and Liveness Detection for Gait-Based User Authentication System on Wearable Devices Using Vibration	Wearable devices-based biometrics has become mainstream in the biometric domain, especially in mobile computing, due to its convenience, flexibility, and potentially high user acceptance. Among various modalities, wearable devices-based gait recognition has been recognized as an effective user authentication method and employed in various applications, such as automated entry systems for home, school, work, vehicles, and automated ticket payment/validation for public transport. However, how secure wearable gait remains an open research question. In this study, we conduct a comprehensive security analysis of the wearable gait. Then, we demonstrate that gait itself is not robust against some attacking methods, such as spoofing or forgery. Therefore, we argue that an anti-spoofing mechanism is important for enhancing the security of wearable gait biometric systems. To this end, we proposed a novel authentication protocol called  $Pistis$  that embedded gait biometrics and a liveness detection mechanism that is aiming to detect various attacks of gait authentication systems. Our extensive experiments based on 50 subjects demonstrate that  $Pistis$  is effective in liveness detection and authentication performance enhancement, providing 100% accuracy for human and nonhuman detection, and 99.53% accuracy for user authentication. Pistis can be used as a liveness detection method for wearable devices-based biometrics, significantly for wearable gait.	https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9996544	0
Unmanned Aerial Vehicle as Encryption Key Distributor for Secure Communications in Smart Grid	We use symmetric cryptography for secure communications with resource-limited smart grid control devices. We propose the novel idea of using the unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) as a physical courier to carry secret key bits generated at the control center to remote control devices. While distributing secret keys, the UAV may be attacked in an attempt to sabotage secure communications. The UAV may fly a longer route to avoid attackers but it has a limited onboard battery capacity and must visit each device within a time limit to prevent a secret key deficit. We formulate an optimization to find the lowest attack risk flight route for secret key distribution while taking into consideration key deficiency and battery capacity. Such optimization is NP-hard. We further propose an efficient algorithm to find a low-risk flight route in less than a second, even for a large power grid system with more than a hundred nodes. For large systems, we modify the proposed algorithm to find a low-risk flight route as well as to determine the required UAV flight duration and battery size. Extensive simulation results confirm the superiority of the proposed algorithm against a baseline scheme that is ignorant of attackers.	https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9973272	0
Traffic Analysis Through Deep-Learning-Based Image Segmentation From UAV Streaming	Alongside many traditional as well as novel applications, in the latest years, drones have been widely adopted as remote sensing platforms for road traffic monitoring in urban areas and on highways. The problem of traffic monitoring on Region of Interest (RoI) based on drone imagery is a challenging task, especially when the surveillance drone is constantly moving. In this work, two specific subtasks have been addressed. The goal of the first stage is to predict the RoI in drone imagery of traffic scenes using deep-learning (DL)-based approaches instead of traditional image processing; in this connection, the goal of the second task is to perform vehicle detection on the selected RoI. To ensure diversity and robustness, drone images with different altitudes, positions, and view points have been considered. To achieve these goals, two custom aerial data sets for RoI extraction and detection were built by collecting aerial sequences from flying unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) and by transmitting them to the base station leveraging 5G technology. Two different ad hoc DL-based architectures have been designed for the RoI extraction task to maximize the accuracy and inference speed, respectively, and have been evaluated on two different data sets: 1) a custom-built data set and 2) a Massachusetts roads data set. Finally, the models providing the best performance have been combined to further improve the overall results. Experimental tests show that the proposed framework represents a promising solution for drone-based road traffic monitoring in critical areas, exploiting imagery from a variety of viewing angles and altitudes.	https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9955239	0
A Triggerless Backdoor Attack and Defense Mechanism for Intelligent Task Offloading in Multi-UAV Systems	In recent years, multiunmanned aerial vehicular systems (MUAVs) have become prevalent in divergent applications: agriculture, spectrum utilization, transportation, forest fire monitoring, and among others, due to their flexible, robust, and autonomous operational maneuver. Battery-powered multiunmanned aerial vehicles (MUAVs) systems possess limited computation and communication resources, significantly reducing their functional dimension by limiting mission time and range. To address this issue, we propose a federated deep reinforcement learning (FDRL)-based intelligent and decentralized task offloading scheme for resource-constrained UAVs that can enhance the operational capability of the MUAV systems. Moreover, the proposed FDRL scheme can improve offloading policy quality while preserving data privacy in MUAV. However, such intelligent systems may fall prey to backdoor attacks that can intervene in the system’s regular operation causing rapid degradation of its performance. We introduce a novel triggerless backdoor attack scheme on intelligent task offloading UAVs and analyze its impact to gauge the resiliency of the offloading policy in the presence of an adversary. Then, we propose lightweight agnostic defense mechanisms to combat such backdoors in multi-UAV settings. The extensive simulation results show that the proposed attack and defense strategies are practical and efficient.	https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9770193	0
Dynamic UAV Deployment for Differentiated Services: A Multi-Agent Imitation Learning Based Approach	Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) have been utilized to serve on-ground users with various services, e.g., computing, communication and caching, due to their mobility and flexibility. The main focus of many recent studies on UAVs is to deploy a set of homogeneous UAVs with identical capabilities controlled by one UAV owner/company to provide services. However, little attention has been paid to the issue of how to enable different UAV owners to provide services with differentiated service capabilities in a shared area. To address this issue, we propose a multi-agent imitation learning enabled UAV deployment approach to maximize both profits of UAV owners and utilities of on-ground users. Specially, a Markov game is formulated among UAV owners and we prove that a Nash equilibrium exists based on the full knowledge of the system. For online scheduling with incomplete information, we design agent policies by imitating the behaviors of corresponding experts. A novel neural network model, integrating convolutional neural networks, generative adversarial networks and a gradient-based policy, can be trained and executed in a fully decentralized manner with a guaranteed $\epsilon$ε-Nash equilibrium. Performance results show that our algorithm has significant superiority in terms of average profits, utilities and execution time compared with other representative algorithms.	https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9552547	0
Observer-Based Event-Triggered Sliding Mode Control for Secure Formation Tracking of Multi-UAV Systems	This article is concerned with the problem of the secure formation tracking of multiple unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) subject to replay attacks, where an observer-based event-triggered sliding mode control approach is adopted. First, a novel attack model is established for multi-UAV systems considering replay attacks, in which the issue of the replay attack beginning and ending within a sampling period is solved. Then, a switched event-triggered scheme is developed for multi-UAV systems subject to replay attacks, under which the corresponding communication mechanisms are invoked for different attack states. This communication scheme brings lower data releasing rate and less energy consumption based on the severity level of replay attacks while the desired tracking performance is ensured. On the basis of the sliding mode control theory, observer-based event-triggered formation tracking strategies are developed for multi-UAV systems with nonlinearities under replay attacks by combining the interactive information from neighbors. Sufficient conditions of the multi-UAV system to achieve the desired formation are obtained by utilizing Lyapunov stability approach. Finally, a simulation example with multiple UAVs is performed to demonstrate the validity of the developed formation control strategy.	https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9961897	0
Unmanned-Aerial-Vehicle-Assisted Wireless Networks: Advancements, Challenges, and Solutions	The rapid development of communication and computing techniques enables unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) to provide reliable and cost-effective wireless communication and computing services from the air. Compared to the conventional fixed infrastructure, UAVs have attractive attributes, such as high flexibility and operability, and, as a result, on-demand line-of-sight connection links. Therefore, UAV-assisted wireless networks have been envisioned as a promising paradigm to achieve enhanced coverage and connectivity for future wireless communications. Meanwhile, achieving high levels of energy efficiency, sensing, communication, and computing capacities, and security and privacy are critical to the success of UAV-assisted wireless networks. In order to improve the performance of UAV-assisted wireless networks, some frameworks and mechanisms have been developed in the past few years. In this article, we provide a comprehensive survey of these developments. Specifically, we conduct a brief overview for the architecture of UAV-assisted wireless networks from four domains (i.e., framework-related, technology-related, challenge-related, and solution-related) and four aspects (i.e., sensing-related, communication-related, computing-related, and application-related). Then, the integrated sensing, communication, and computing for UAV-assisted wireless networks is introduced, followed by the characteristics and requirements. We also provide the implementation and applications of UAV-assisted wireless networks. Next, we discuss the challenges and the state-of-the-art solutions for UAV-assisted wireless networks. Finally, the advanced technologies for UAV-assisted communication and computing networks are exploited, followed by the potential research directions.	https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9994654	0
AD-RCNN: Adaptive Dynamic Neural Network for Small Object Detection	With the large-scale commercialization of 5G networks, Internet of Things (IoT) applications keep on emerging in recent years. Real-time environmental awareness is an essential part of various IoT applications, e.g., self-driving vehicles. Object detection plays a fundamental role in real-time environmental awareness, which is responsible for acquiring valuable object information from the environment automatically. Despite of the fast progress for object detection in general, small object detection still faces challenges. Because of the restricted scales, small objects are only capable of generating relatively week features after multiple convolutional layers, thus causing low detection accuracy. Existing schemes mostly focus on extracting rich multiscale features, e.g., generating high-resolution features through generative adversarial networks (GANs), or generating multiscale features through feature combination. Nevertheless, these schemes require complex network implementation, and usually suffer from high processing delay because of high-resolution images. To resolve the problems mentioned above, we propose an adaptive dynamic neural network (AD-RCNN) that consists of three fundamental improvements. We first propose a dynamic region proposal network to improve the quality of region proposals. We then introduce a visual attention scheme to generate features of regions. Finally, we put forward an adaptive dynamic training module to optimize final detection results. Experimental results demonstrate that AD-RCNN outperforms the state-of-the-art from the perspectives of mAP and frames per second (FPS). Specifically, at the resolution of 1024 of TT100K data set, AD-RCNN achieves 68.8% mAP, which outperforms the baseline Faster RCNN by 8.52%.	https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9924201	0
Flying Among Stars: Jamming-Resilient Channel Selection for UAVs Through Aerial Constellations	Wireless communication between an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) and the ground base station is susceptible to adversarial jamming. In such situations, it is important for the UAV to indicate a new channel to the BS. This paper describes a method of creating spatial codes that map the chosen channel to the location of the UAVs in space, wherein the latter physically traverses the space from a given so called ”constellation points” to another. These points create patterns in the sky, analogous to modulation constellations in classical wireless communications, and are detected at the BS through a millimeter-wave radar sensor. A constellation point represents a distinct n-bit field mapped to a specific channel, allowing simultaneous frequency switching at both ends without any RF transmissions. The main contributions of this paper are: (i) We conduct experimental studies to demonstrate how such constellations may be formed using COTS UAVs and mmWave sensors, (ii) We develop a theoretical framework that maps a desired constellation design to error and band switching time, including multi-user scenario-specific challenges, (iii) We compare our approach against current FHSS technology and (iv) We experimentally demonstrate jamming resilient communications and validate system goodput for links formed by UAV-mounted software defined radios.	https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9508187	0
Adversarial Attacks Against Acoustic Monitoring of Industrial Machines	The recent rise of adversarial machine learning exposed the serious vulnerabilities existing in current frameworks depending on the smooth operation of such automated solutions. This article focuses on the critical field of monitoring the health of industrial machines based on the respective acoustic emissions. After building an audio-based monitoring solution using log-Mel spectrograms and convolutional neural networks, we systematically evaluate the applicability of four types of adversarial attacks: 1) fast gradient sign; 2) projected gradient descent; 3) Jacobian saliency map; and 4) Carlini and Wagner  $\ell _{\infty }$ . Seeing the problem from the attacker perspective, we designed two different attack types, aiming at inducing either false positives or false negatives. We define three figures of merit specifically designed to assess the performance of each attack type from diverse points of view. The experimental setup relies on a publicly available data set including acoustic emissions representing four industrial machines, i.e., fan, pump, slider rail, and valve.	https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9844239	0
Machine Learning Insights for Behavioral Data Analysis Supporting the Autonomous Vehicles Scenario	The advent of the digital innovation era is changing service, use, and resources management paradigms, offering a wide range of new and essential opportunities. In particular, the advent of the Internet of Things (IoT), i.e., the ability to connect individual objects to the Internet, also capable of communicating autonomously, has its particular declination on the connected vehicle. It is combined with the potential of advanced sensors placed pervasively on vehicles, which offer multifunctional monitoring capabilities of the entire system: from individual components up to the whole vehicle, including driver behavior and conditions and many exogenous parameters to the vehicle (road and weather conditions, congestion, risk situations, changes to mobility plans, etc.). In this perspective, machine learning (ML) models can transform raw data into new knowledge; they can contribute in an innovative way to define and suggest decisions, strategies, and criteria for resource use. Nowadays, most intelligent mobility projects also integrate artificial intelligence (AI) and ML solutions. In this article, we present and discuss the application of unsupervised learning techniques on a vehicular IoT data set. The main goal is to generate new knowledge about a geographical zone by analyzing historical drivers behavioral data. The autonomous vehicle’s framework can exploit the generated valuable insights to optimize the routes and prevent critical issues.	https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9564257	0
Collaboration-Aware Relay Selection for AUV in Internet of Underwater Network: Evolving Contextual Bandit Learning Approach	In Internet of Underwater Things, data collection is assisted by autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV) to enhance the reliable transmission. AUV acts as a mobile collector and transmits the collected data to the station via relay nodes. However, the highly mobile nature of AUV needs an adaptive and efficient relay selection scheme for achieving good capacity performance. In this article, we propose a new contextual multiarmed bandit with evolving relay set (CMAB-ERS) learning framework, which successfully addresses crucial issues, including dynamic environment conditions and evolving relay set. To deal with the evolving relay set, CMAB-ERS incorporates collaborative effects into inference as well as learning processes, the new relays will acquire prior knowledge by having experienced nodes sharing observations, reducing the learning time significantly. To overcome the uncertainty of environmental information, we exploit the contextual environment factors to assist relay reward estimation and execute time-sensitive parameter update after every transmit–receive cycle, aiming for minimizing potential loss due to the time-varying channel. Correspondingly, the collaboration-aware online contextual bandit learning (COCBL) algorithm is designed that enables AUV to switch optimal relay adaptively and promises high-capacity transmission. Further, we rigorously prove the convergence of the COCBL algorithm by considering the evolving relay set and give its upper bound on the cumulative regret. Finally, extensive simulation results elucidate the effectiveness of the proposed COCBL.	https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9910599	0
Deep Reinforcement Learning for Aerial Data Collection in Hybrid-Powered NOMA-IoT Networks	With the help of unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV), remote terminals that out of wireless coverage can be connected to the Internet of Things (IoT) networks. Currently, the IoT relies on a large number of low-cost wireless sensors with limited energy supply to realize ubiquitous monitoring and intelligent control. The hybrid-powered networks composed of wireless-powered communication (WPC) terminal and solar-powered UAV can solve the energy supply problem of the IoT networks, and the nonorthogonal multiple access (NOMA) technique can solve the massive access problem of IoT terminals. Exploiting these benefits, we investigate joint UAV 3-D trajectory design and time allocation for aerial data collection in hybrid-powered NOMA-IoT networks. To maximize the total fair network throughput, we jointly consider energy limitation, Quality of Service (QoS) requirements, and flight conditions. The problem is nonconvex and time-dimension coupled which is intractable to solve by traditional optimization methods. Therefore, we develop a deep reinforcement learning (DRL) algorithm called fair communication is accomplished by trajectory design and time allocation (FC-TDTA), which uses the deep deterministic policy gradient (DDPG) as its basis. Simulation results show that our proposed algorithm performs better than benchmarks in fair throughput maximization. The proposed FC-TDTA algorithm can make the UAV: 1) fly in appropriate direction and speed, so that the UAV can arrive at the charging station before the energy runs out and 2) conduct WPC energy transmission and data collection to achieve fair communication.	https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9903854	0
Modeling Human Driving Behavior Through Generative Adversarial Imitation Learning	An open problem in autonomous vehicle safety validation is building reliable models of human driving behavior in simulation. This work presents an approach to learn neural driving policies from real world driving demonstration data. We model human driving as a sequential decision making problem that is characterized by non-linearity and stochasticity, and unknown underlying cost functions. Imitation learning is an approach for generating intelligent behavior when the cost function is unknown or difficult to specify. Building upon work in inverse reinforcement learning (IRL), Generative Adversarial Imitation Learning (GAIL) aims to provide effective imitation even for problems with large or continuous state and action spaces, such as modeling human driving. This article describes the use of GAIL for learning-based driver modeling. Because driver modeling is inherently a multi-agent problem, where the interaction between agents needs to be modeled, this paper describes a parameter-sharing extension of GAIL called PS-GAIL to tackle multi-agent driver modeling. In addition, GAIL is domain agnostic, making it difficult to encode specific knowledge relevant to driving in the learning process. This paper describes Reward Augmented Imitation Learning (RAIL), which modifies the reward signal to provide domain-specific knowledge to the agent. Finally, human demonstrations are dependent upon latent factors that may not be captured by GAIL. This paper describes Burn-InfoGAIL, which allows for disentanglement of latent variability in demonstrations. Imitation learning experiments are performed using NGSIM, a real-world highway driving dataset. Experiments show that these modifications to GAIL can successfully model highway driving behavior, accurately replicating human demonstrations and generating realistic, emergent behavior in the traffic flow arising from the interaction between driving agents.	https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9990591	0
Joint Multi-Domain Resource Allocation and Trajectory Optimization in UAV-Assisted Maritime IoT Networks	The integration of Maritime Internet of Things (M-IoT) technology and unmanned aerial/surface vehicles (UAVs/USVs) has been emerging as a promising navigational information technique in intelligent ocean systems. In this article, we consider the UAV-assisted M-IoT network where USVs offload computation-intensive maritime tasks via non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) to the UAV equipped with the mobile-edge computing (MEC) server subject to the UAV mobility. To improve the energy efficiency of offloading transmission and workload computation, we focus on minimizing the total energy consumption by jointly optimizing the USVs’ offloaded workload, transmit power, computation resource allocation, as well as the UAV trajectory subject to the USVs’ latency requirements. Despite the nature of mixed discrete and non-convex programming of the formulated problem, we exploit the vertical decomposition and propose a two-layered algorithm for solving it efficiently. Specifically, the top-layered algorithm is proposed to solve the problem of optimizing the UAV trajectory based on the idea of deep reinforcement learning (DRL), and the underlying algorithm is proposed to optimize the underlying multidomain resource allocation problem based on the idea of the Lagrangian multiplier method. Numerical results are provided to validate the effectiveness of our proposed algorithms as well as the performance advantage of NOMA-enabled computation offloading in terms of overall energy consumption.	https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9865231	0
SeqOT: A Spatial–Temporal Transformer Network for Place Recognition Using Sequential LiDAR Data	Place recognition is an important component for autonomous vehicles to achieve loop closing or global localization. In this article, we tackle the problem of place recognition based on sequential 3-D LiDAR scans obtained by an onboard LiDAR sensor. We propose a transformer-based network named SeqOT to exploit the temporal and spatial information provided by sequential range images generated from the LiDAR data. It uses multiscale transformers to generate a global descriptor for each sequence of LiDAR range images in an end-to-end fashion. During online operation, our SeqOT finds similar places by matching such descriptors between the current query sequence and those stored in the map. We evaluate our approach on four datasets collected with different types of LiDAR sensors in different environments. The experimental results show that our method outperforms the state-of-the-art LiDAR-based place recognition methods and generalizes well across different environments. Furthermore, our method operates online faster than the frame rate of the sensor.	https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9994714	0
PIT: Progressive Interaction Transformer for Pedestrian Crossing Intention Prediction	For autonomous driving, one of the major challenges is to predict pedestrian crossing intention in ego-view. Pedestrian intention depends not only on their intrinsic goals but also on the stimulation of surrounding traffic elements. Considering the influence of other traffic elements on pedestrian intention, recent work introduced more traffic element information into the model to successfully improve performance. However, it is still difficult to effectively capture and fully exploit the potential dynamic spatio-temporal interactions among the target pedestrian and its surrounding traffic elements for accurate reasoning. In this work, inspired by neuroscience that human drivers tend to make continuous sensory-motor driving decisions by progressive visual stimulation, we propose a model termed Progressive Interaction Transformer (PIT) for pedestrian crossing intention prediction. Local pedestrian, global environment, and ego-vehicle motion are considered simultaneously in the proposed PIT. In particular, the temporal fusion block and self-attention mechanism are introduced to jointly and progressively model the dynamic spatio-temporal interactions among the three parties, allowing it to capture richer information and make prediction in a similar way to human drivers. Experimental results demonstrate that PIT achieves higher performance compared with other state-of-the-arts and preserves real-time inference.	https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=10247098	0
Smart Underwater Pollution Detection Based on Graph-Based Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning Towards AUV-Based Network ITS	The exploitation/utilization of marine resources and the rapid development of urbanization along coastal cities result in serious marine pollution, especially underwater diffusion pollution. It is a non-trivial task to detect the source of diffusion pollution, such that the disadvantageous effect of the pollution can be reduced. With the vision of 6G framework, we employ Autonomous Underwater Vehicle (AUV) flock and introduce the concept of AUV-based network. In particular, we utilize the Software-Defined Networking (SDN) technique to update the controllability of the AUV-based network, leading to the paradigm of SDN-enabled multi-AUVs network Intelligent Transportation Systems (SDNA-ITS). For SDNA-ITS, we utilize artificial potential field theories to model the control model. To optimize the system output, we introduce the graph-based Soft Actor-Critic (SAC) algorithm, i.e., a category of Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL) mechanism where each AUV can be regarded as a node in a graph. In particular, we improve the optimization model based on Centralized Training Decentralized Execution (CTDE) architecture with the assistance of the SDN controller, by which each AUV can efficiently adjust its speed towards the diffusion source. Further, to achieve exact path planning for detecting the diffusion source, a dynamic detection scheme is proposed to output the united control policy to schedule the SDNA-ITS dynamically. Simulation results demonstrate that our approaches are available to detect the underwater diffusion source when the actual scenario is taken into account and perform better than some recent research products.	https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9750063	0
Convex Vision-Based Negative Obstacle Detection Framework for Autonomous Vehicles	This study investigates the convex optimization frameworks for accurate and fast negative obstacle detection as well as depth estimations that are vital for real-time, superior autonomous vehicle operations. A convex framework is proposed in conjunction with a unique stereo perception approach to manage the complex nature of such invisible obstacles. The proposed stereo configuration incorporates an alignment that displaces the cameras along a vertical baseline to extract useful information pertaining to negative obstacle features for various illustrative terrain settings. The convex framework exploits these properties to evaluate depth jumps in the disparity space image and perform geometrical analysis of potential occlusion regions. The corresponding convex formulations are based on linear matrix inequalities to detect sudden disparity, angle profile, and intensity variations for potential negative obstacles and to estimate the internal depth of the detected obstacles. Experimental results demonstrate that consecutive processes can be structured in a convex framework to efficiently identify negative obstacle attributes at a range of distances for texture varying environments, providing a vital extension to real-time vehicular system implementations with superior detection rates.	https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9697383	0
Graph Neural Networks for Intelligent Transportation Systems: A Survey	Graph neural networks (GNNs) have been extensively used in a wide variety of domains in recent years. Owing to their power in analyzing graph-structured data, they have become broadly popular in intelligent transportation systems (ITS) applications as well. Despite their widespread applications in different transportation domains, there is no comprehensive review of recent advancements and future research directions that covers all transportation areas. Accordingly, in this survey, for the first time, we provide an overview of GNN studies in the general domain of ITS. Unlike previous surveys, which have been limited to traffic forecasting problems, we explore how GNN frameworks have evolved for different ITS applications, including traffic forecasting, demand prediction, autonomous vehicles, intersection management, parking management, urban planning, and transportation safety. Also, we micro-categorize the studies based on their transportation application to identify domain-specific research directions, opportunities, and challenges, which have been missing in previous surveys. Moreover, we identify unique and undiscussed research opportunities and directions, which is the result of reviewing a wide range of transportation applications. The neglected role of edge and graph learning in ITS applications, developing multi-modal models, and exploiting the power of unsupervised and reinforcement learning methods for developing more powerful GNNs are some examples of such new discussions in this survey. Finally, we have identified popular baseline models and datasets in each transportation domain, which facilitate the development and evaluation of future GNN-based frameworks.	https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=10077454	0
Fast Fixed-Time Output Multi-Formation Tracking of Networked Autonomous Surface Vehicles: A Mathematical Induction Method	In this paper, we aim to exploit an effective way to solve the output multi-formation tracking problem of the networked autonomous surface vehicles (ASVs) in a fast fixed time manner. Specifically, addressing the output multi-formation tracking problem implies that 1) the networked ASVs are divided into multiple interconnected subnetworks with respect to multiple targets; 2) for each subnetwork, the outputs of the networked ASVs form a desired geometric formation with exchanging the local interactions. Besides, solving the fast fixed-time tracking problem in this paper implies that 1) the convergence time is independent of the initial conditions; 2) the system states are forced to reach the employed nonsingular fixed-time sliding surface in a prescribed time, which thus called fast fixed-time control. Then, based on a time-related function and a nonsingular fixed-time sliding surface, a hierarchical fast fixed-time control algorithm is proposed to solve the aforementioned problem within a fast fixed time being independent of the initial conditions. Furthermore, by employing the Lyapunov argument and mathematical induction, we present the sufficient conditions for fast fixed-time convergence of the tracking errors with respect to multiple targets. Finally, numerous simulation examples are presented to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed control algorithm.	https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=10005858	0
User Selection and Codebook Design for NOMA-Based High Altitude Platform Station (HAPS) Communications	High altitude platform station (HAPS) communications have made a tremendous impact on recent research into sixth-generation (6G) and beyond wireless networks. The large coverage area and significant computational capability of HAPS systems enable many areas of utilization in 6G and beyond applications, including Internet of Things (IoT) services, augmented reality, and connected autonomous vehicles. In addition, non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) is a cutting-edge technology that can be utilized to enhance spectral efficiency in HAPS systems. In this paper, we exploit NOMA-based HAPS communications and multiple antennas to meet the connectivity, reliability, and high-data-rate requirements of 6G and beyond applications. We propose a user selection and correlation-based user pairing algorithm for a NOMA-based multi-user HAPS system. Moreover, we investigate the codebook design for HAPS communication and adapt the polar-cap codebook (PCC) to the HAPS channel which shows Rician fading propagation characteristics dominated by the line-of-sight (LOS) component. Performance evaluations show that the proposed user selection algorithm is perfectly suited to the HAPS channel and that the PCC provides a remarkable spectral efficiency.	https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9942358	0
CMX: Cross-Modal Fusion for RGB-X Semantic Segmentation With Transformers	Scene understanding based on image segmentation is a crucial component of autonomous vehicles. Pixel-wise semantic segmentation of RGB images can be advanced by exploiting complementary features from the supplementary modality ( ${X}$ -modality). However, covering a wide variety of sensors with a modality-agnostic model remains an unresolved problem due to variations in sensor characteristics among different modalities. Unlike previous modality-specific methods, in this work, we propose a unified fusion framework, CMX, for RGB-X semantic segmentation. To generalize well across different modalities, that often include supplements as well as uncertainties, a unified cross-modal interaction is crucial for modality fusion. Specifically, we design a Cross-Modal Feature Rectification Module (CM-FRM) to calibrate bi-modal features by leveraging the features from one modality to rectify the features of the other modality. With rectified feature pairs, we deploy a Feature Fusion Module (FFM) to perform sufficient exchange of long-range contexts before mixing. To verify CMX, for the first time, we unify five modalities complementary to RGB, i.e., depth, thermal, polarization, event, and LiDAR. Extensive experiments show that CMX generalizes well to diverse multi-modal fusion, achieving state-of-the-art performances on five RGB-Depth benchmarks, as well as RGB-Thermal, RGB-Polarization, and RGB-LiDAR datasets. Besides, to investigate the generalizability to dense-sparse data fusion, we establish an RGB-Event semantic segmentation benchmark based on the EventScape dataset, on which CMX sets the new state-of-the-art. The source code of CMX is publicly available at https://github.com/huaaaliu/RGBX_Semantic_ Segmentation.	https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=10231003	0
Robust Lane Change Decision Making for Autonomous Vehicles: An Observation Adversarial Reinforcement Learning Approach	Reinforcementlearning holds the promise of allowing autonomous vehicles to learn complex decision making behaviors through interacting with other traffic participants. However, many real-world driving tasks involve unpredictable perception errors or measurement noises which may mislead an autonomous vehicle into making unsafe decisions, even cause catastrophic failures. In light of these risks, to ensure safety under perception uncertainty, autonomous vehicles are required to be able to cope with the worst case observation perturbations. Therefore, this paper proposes a novel observation adversarial reinforcement learning approach for robust lane change decision making of autonomous vehicles. A constrained observation-robust Markov decision process is presented to model lane change decision making behaviors of autonomous vehicles under policy constraints and observation uncertainties. Meanwhile, a black-box attack technique based on Bayesian optimization is implemented to approximate the optimal adversarial observation perturbations efficiently. Furthermore, a constrained observation-robust actor-critic algorithm is advanced to optimize autonomous driving lane change policies while keeping the variations of the policies attacked by the optimal adversarial observation perturbations within bounds. Finally, the robust lane change decision making approach is evaluated in three stochastic mixed traffic flows based on different densities. The results demonstrate that the proposed method can not only enhance the performance of an autonomous vehicle but also improve the robustness of lane change policies against adversarial observation perturbations.	https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9750867	0
Toward Optimal Deployment of UAV Relays in UAV-Assisted Internet of Vehicles	The past decade has witnessed an explosive growth of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), which have attracted great attention in assisting Internet of Vehicles (IoV) communication systems thanks to the advantages of cost-effectiveness, high maneuverability, and flexible deployment. Yet several issues, such as UAVs' transmit power and energy resources as well as the high-speed mobility of IoV user equipment (VUE), pose challenges to the development of UAVs in UAV-assisted IoV. To provide reliable and high-throughput wireless links for VUEs in a given ground area, this article considers a scenario in which a ground VUE is facing difficulties in receiving service from a ground roadside unit (RSU) owing to possible sudden RSU malfunction or poor signal coverage. In this case, UAVs are generally deployed in the air, serving as relays to establish communication links between uncovered VUE and the neighboring RSU. To maximize the system capacity, we investigate the deployment problem of UAV relays under single-UAV relaying and multi-UAV relaying cases upon considering VUE mobility, and exploit the optimal deployment strategy of UAV relays under fixed total power consumption. Comprehensive simulation results verify that the proposed algorithm can outperform benchmark methods on significant critical indicators such as the average achievable user rate, and the outage probability. Also, evaluations and analyses have highlighted the effects of key system parameters (e.g., altitude, number, and transmit power of UAV relays) on optimal UAV relay deployment position and system performance.	https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=10117548	0
Reachability Analysis Plus Satisfiability Modulo Theories: An Adversary-Proof Control Method for Connected and Autonomous Vehicles	Connected and autonomous vehicles (CAVs) are expected to operate with safety guarantee in presence of adversaries from the Internet of Vehicles. This article proposes a control method named reachability analysis plus satisfiability modulo theories (RA-SMT) for CAVs against integrity attacks caused by bounded adversary. This method enables vehicles to possess the reach-avoid specification and strict control safety ensurance even in the worst case scenario. The introduction of state-feedback control decomposes the original complex problem into more manageable reachability analysis and adversary-free control strategy optimization. Precisely, zonotope sets are employed for reachability analysis, and the control strategy is optimally solved and verified simultaneously via SMT. This method is applicable to complex traffic scenarios with the help of SMT, which can describe various constraints flexibly and conveniently. Simulation results reveal the effectiveness and safety of the proposed method in the classical car-following scenario against bounded adversary under various conditions. Particularly, RA-SMT exhibits significantly improved control performance (around 16%) and computation efficiency (around 63%) compared with existing methods. Finally, the RA-SMT is implemented on an autonomous driving platform to validate its practicability.	https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9756285	0
Off-Policy Learning-Based Following Control of Cooperative Autonomous Vehicles Under Distributed Attacks	This paper investigates the resilient distributed secure output path following control problem of heterogeneous autonomous ground vehicles (AGVs) subject to cyber attacks based on reinforcement learning algorithm. Most existing results are subject to the same attack models for all communication channels, however multiple channels launched by different attackers are considered in this paper. First, a predictor-acknowledgement clock algorithm for each vehicle is proposed to judge whether the communication channel among neighboring vehicles is attacked or not by receiving or transmitting an acknowledgement. Then, a resilient distributed predictor is proposed to predict the pinning vehicle’s state for each vehicle. In addition, a resilient local control protocol consisting of the feedforward state provided by the predictor and the local feedback state of each vehicle is developed for the output path following problem, which is further converted to the optimal control problem by designing a discounted performance function. Discounted algebraic Riccati equations (AREs) are derived to address the optimal control problem. An off-policy reinforcement learning (RL) algorithm is put forward to learn the solution of discounted AREs online without any prior knowledge of vehicles’ dynamics. It is shown that the RL-based output path following control problem of AGVs imposed by cyber attacks can be achieved in an optimal manner. Finally, a numerical example is provided to verify the effectiveness of theoretical analysis.	https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=10038626	0
AI-Empowered Speed Extraction via Port-Like Videos for Vehicular Trajectory Analysis	Automated container terminal (ACT) is considered as port industry development direction, and accurate kinematic data (speed, volume, etc.) is essential for enhancing ACT operation efficiency and safety. Port surveillance videos provide much useful spatial-temporal information with advantages of easy obtainable, large spatial coverage, etc. In that way, it is of great importance to analyze automated guided vehicle (AGV) trajectory movement from port surveillance videos. Motivated by the newly emerging computer vision and artificial intelligence (AI) techniques, we propose an ensemble framework for extracting vehicle speeds from port-like surveillance videos for the purpose of analyzing AGV moving trajectory. Firstly, the framework exploits vehicle position in each image via a feature-enhanced scale-aware descriptor. Secondly, we match vehicle position and trajectory data from the previous step output via Kalman filter and Hungarian algorithm, and thus we obtain the vehicular imaging trajectory in a frame-by-frame manner. Thirdly, we estimate the vehicular moving speed in real-world via the help of perspective projection theory. The experimental results suggest that our proposed framework can obtain accurate vehicle kinematic data under typical port traffic scenarios considering that the average measurement error of root mean square deviation is 0.675 km/h, the mean absolute deviation is 0.542 km/h, and the Pearson correlation coefficient is 0.9349. The research findings suggest that cutting-edge AI and computer vision techniques can accurately extract on-site vehicular trajectory related data from port videos, and thus help port traffic participants make more reasonable management decisions.	https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9764667	0
Secrecy Rate Degradation of Ground-to-Air Collaborative Beamforming Due to UAV Jitter	In this article, we consider the secure uplink transmissions from ground nodes to an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) receiver through analog collaborative beamforming (ACB). When the location information of the UAV receiver is available, ACB can be realized in a fully distributed manner, since each transmitting node can locally adjust its phase. ACB-based physical layer security (PLS) algorithm, where the virtual antenna array (VAA) elements are randomly selected at each transmit time unit, can effectively protect against eavesdropping attacks by creating artificial noise to the directions except the legitimate receiver (Bob). However, when Bob is mounted on the UAV, it can suffer from array gain loss due to jittering effects caused by airflow turbulence and mechanical vibration. Motivated by this issue, in this article, we investigate the impact of the UAV jitter on the secrecy performance. We derive the theoretical expressions of the secrecy rate both in the absence and presence of the jittering effects. Further, the simulation results show that the ACB-based PLS cannot guarantee non-zero secrecy rate even with the radial distance perturbations on the order of a few centimeters, especially when an eavesdropper (Eve) exists in close proximity to Bob.	https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=10098913	0
Three-Dimensional Trajectory Design for Unmanned Aerial Vehicle-Based Secure and Energy-Efficient Data Collection	Fixed-wing unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) provide a practical means for data collection in many Internet-of-Things (IoT) applications. Secrecy and energy efficiency are crucial to the data collection, but have never been well addressed in the lack of appropriate propulsion energy models for three-dimensional (3D) flights of fixed-wing UAVs. This paper delivers a new approach to the joint optimization of the 3D flight trajectory and data collection schedule of a fixed-wing UAV for secure and energy-efficient data collection under an eavesdropping attack. A critical aspect is that we derive a new propulsion energy model for fixed-wing UAVs flying 3D trajectories. By using equivalent transformation, difference-of-convex techniques, and successive convex approximation, we convexify the model and demonstrate its viability to the design of energy-efficient 3D trajectories. Another key aspect is that we further optimize the trajectory and schedule of the UAV for secure and energy-efficient collection of secret data from sensor nodes on the ground. This is non-trivial due to the convexification of the non-smooth secrecy constraints in addition to the new 3D propulsion energy model. Simulations validate the new model and demonstrate considerable energy saving of 3D trajectories, compared to two-dimensional (2D) trajectories optimized based on the state-of-the-art 2D propulsion energy model.	https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9875063	0
Data Poisoning Attacks in Internet-of-Vehicle Networks: Taxonomy, State-of-The-Art, and Future Directions	With the unprecedented development of deep learning, autonomous vehicles (AVs) have achieved tremendous progress nowadays. However, AV supported by DNN models is vulnerable to data poisoning attacks, hindering the large-scale application of autonomous driving. For example, by injecting carefully designed poisons into the training dataset of the DNN model in the traffic sign recognition system, the attacker can mislead the system to make targeted misclassification or cause a reduction in model classification accuracy. In this article, we conduct a thorough investigation of the state-of-the-art data poisoning attacks and defenses against AVs. According to whether the attacker needs to manipulate the data labeling process, we divide the state-of-the-art attack approaches into two categories, i.e., dirty-label attacks and clean-label attacks. We also differentiate the existing defense methods into two categories based on whether to modify the training data or the models, i.e., data-based defenses and model-based defenses. In addition to a detailed review of attacks and defenses in each category, we also give a qualitative comparison of the existing attacks and defenses. Besides, we provide a quantitative comparison of the existing attack and defense methods through experiments. Last but not least, we pinpoint several future directions for data poisoning attacks and defenses in AVs, providing possible ways for further research.	https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9855872	0
Lightweight and Bilateral Controllable Data Sharing for Secure Autonomous Vehicles Platooning Service	Autonomous vehicle platoons are emerging as a promising solution to modern urban governance challenges, such as traffic congestion, air pollution, and fuel waste. As a data-driven paradigm, ensuring secure data sharing is a key challenge for autonomous vehicle platoon applications. However, existing research on secure data sharing of autonomous vehicles platoon suffers from practical weaknesses such as privacy leakage, lack of flexible data source identification, and inefficiency. Motivated by that, this article first proposes the LFBA scheme, which is the first fine-grained data sharing framework that supports bilateral access control and access policy hiding with lightweight and almost constant computational and storage resources consumption, this can be owed to the sophisticated algorithm structure we designed. We then construct an edge-assisted deployment model over LFBA (EA-LFBA) to further improve efficiency and security against common attacks. We then provide the security proof for LFBA, and security analysis for EA-LFBA. Simulation tests and comparative experiments demonstrate the practicality and superiority of our solution compared to state-of-the-art representative works.	https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=10155176	0
Reconfigurable Wireless Relaying With Multi-UAV-Carried Intelligent Reflecting Surfaces	Intelligent reflecting surface (IRS) can reconfigure wireless environment to improve channel capacity and extend coverage. In this paper, we develop a reconfigurable wireless relaying system aided by multiple unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV)-carried intelligent reflecting surfaces (IRSs), where both the significant active and passive beamforming gain brought by base station (BS) and IRS and the flexibility of UAV is exploited to enhance multiuser downlink transmission. Specifically, we jointly optimize UAVs' placement, active beamforming and power allocation at the BS, and passive beamforming at the UAV-IRSs to maximize the weighted sum rate. To address the corresponding optimization problem, we decompose it into several subproblems, which are iteratively optimized. Based on simulation results, the proposed scheme achieves significant performance gains over the benchmark schemes.	https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9976271	0
Risk Assessment for Connected Vehicles Under Stealthy Attacks on Vehicle-to-Vehicle Networks	Cooperative Adaptive Cruise Control (CACC) is an autonomous vehicle-following technology that allows groups of vehicles on the highway to form in tightly-coupled platoons. This is accomplished by exchanging inter-vehicle data through Vehicle-to-Vehicle (V2V) wireless communication networks. CACC increases traffic throughput and safety, and decreases energy consumption. However, the surge of vehicle connectivity has brought new security challenges as vehicular networks increasingly serve as new access points for adversaries trying to deteriorate the platooning performance or even cause collisions. In this manuscript, we propose a novel anomaly detection scheme that leverage real-time sensor/network data and physics-based mathematical models of vehicles in the platoon. Nevertheless, even the best detection scheme could lead to conservative detection results because of unavoidable modelling uncertainties, network effects (delays, quantization, communication dropouts), and noise. It is hard (often impossible) for any detector to distinguish between these different perturbation sources and actual attack signals. This enables adversaries to launch a range of attack strategies that can surpass the detection scheme by hiding within the system uncertainty. Here, we provide risk assessment tools (in terms of semi-definite programs) for Connected and Automated Vehicles (CAVs) to quantify the potential effect of attacks that remain hidden from the detector (referred here as stealthy attacks). A numerical case-study is presented to illustrate the effectiveness of our methods.	https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=10184481	0
RDMNet: Reliable Dense Matching Based Point Cloud Registration for Autonomous Driving	Point cloud registration is an important task in robotics and autonomous driving to estimate the ego-motion of the vehicle. Recent advances following the coarse-to-fine manner show promising potential in point cloud registration. However, existing methods rely on good superpoint correspondences, which are hard to be obtained reliably and efficiently, thus resulting in less robust and accurate point cloud registration. In this paper, we propose a novel network, named RDMNet, to find dense point correspondences coarse-to-fine and improve final pose estimation based on such reliable correspondences. Our RDMNet uses a devised 3D-RoFormer mechanism to first extract distinctive superpoints and generates reliable superpoints matches between two point clouds. The proposed 3D-RoFormer fuses 3D position information into the transformer network, efficiently exploiting point clouds’ contextual and geometric information to generate robust superpoint correspondences. RDMNet then propagates the sparse superpoints matches to dense point matches using the neighborhood information for accurate point cloud registration. We extensively evaluate our method on multiple datasets from different environments. The experimental results demonstrate that our method outperforms existing state-of-the-art approaches in all tested datasets with a strong generalization ability.	https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=10246847	0
TAGKA: Threshold Authenticated Group Key Agreement Protocol Against Member Disconnect for UANET	The development of unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) technology has been advancing rapidly and is widely applied in various domains. Compared to a single UAV, the multi-UAV system, known as the UAV Ad Hoc Network (UANET), can collaborate to accomplish complex tasks more efficiently. Due to the UAVs communicating through open wireless channels, they are vulnerable to various attacks. Group key agreement protocols are often used to guarantee the security of UANET communication. However, the high dynamics of UAVs and the instability of the wireless links often result in certain UAVs temporarily losing connection with the group, rendering them incapable of participating in the group key agreement process. Regrettably, existing literature on group key agreement does not consider this issue, which makes them not applicable to UANET. To address this issue, we propose a threshold authenticated group key agreement protocol (TAGKA) that can resist the disconnection of group members. Then, considering that the temporarily disconnected UAVs need to obtain the latest group key after the communication links are recovered, we design a group key recovery protocol. The security of the scheme is proved under the random oracle model. Moreover, formal security verification using the Tamarin and rigorous informal security analysis is also performed. Finally, we use NS-3 to simulate the protocol, and the experimental results show that our protocol can be effectively applied to UANET.	https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=10158389	0
Secure Transmission Scheme Based on Joint Radar and Communication in Mobile Vehicular Networks	Vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) communication applications face significant challenges to security and privacy since all types of possible breaches are common in connected and autonomous vehicles (CAVs) networks. As an inheritance from conventional wireless services, potential eavesdropping is one of the main threats to V2V communications. In our work, the anti-eavesdropping scheme in CAVs networks is developed through the use of cognitive risk control (CRC)-based vehicular joint radar-communication (JRC) system. In particular, the supplement of off-board measurements acquired using V2V links to the perceptual information has presented the potential to enhance the traffic target positioning precision. Then, transmission power control is performed utilizing reinforcement learning, the result of which is determined by a task switcher. Based on the threat evaluation, a multiple armed bandit problem is designed to implement the secret key switching procedure when it is needed. Through constant perception-execution loops (PELs), the security and confidentiality is improved for the authorized vehicles in their behavioral interactions with the illegal eavesdropper. Numerical experiments have presented that the developed approach has anticipated performance in terms of some risk assessment indicators.	https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=10120634	0
A Multicriteria-Based Forwarding Strategy for Interest Flooding Mitigation on Named Data Wireless Networking	In wireless networks, the Named Data Networking (NDN) architecture maximizes contents’ availability throughout multiple network paths based on multicast-based communication combined with stateful forwarding and caching in intermediate nodes. Despite its benefits, the downside of the architecture resides in the packet flooding not efficiently prevented by current forwarding strategies and mainly associated with the native flooding of the architecture or malicious packets from Interest Flooding Attack (IFA). This work introduces iFLAT, a multicriteria-based forwarding strategy for interest FLooding mitigATion on named data wireless networking. It follows a cross-layer approach that considers: (i) the Received Signal Strength (RSS) to adjust itself to the current status of the wireless network links, (ii) the network traffic (meInfo) to detect flooding issues and traffic anomalies, and (iii) a fake Interest Blacklist to identify IFA-related flooding. In doing so, the strategy achieves better efficiency on Interest flooding mitigation, addressing both native and IFA types of flooding. We evaluated the proposed strategy by reproducing a Flying Ad hoc Network (FANET) composed of Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) featured by the NDN stack deployed in all nodes. Simulation results show that iFLAT can effectively detect and mitigate flooding, regardless of its origin or nature, achieving greater packet forwarding efficiency than competing strategies. In broadcast storm and IFA scenarios, it achieved 25.75% and 37.37% of traffic reduction, whereas Interest satisfaction rates of 16.36% and 51.78% higher, respectively.	https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9888056	0
Reactive Symbolic Planning and Control in Dynamic Adversarial Environments	Satisfying both safety and reachability requirements in dynamic adversarial environments is very challenging, particularly when little or no information about the dynamics and intentions of the adversarial objects is available. Therefore, this article addresses the problem of path planning and control of autonomous vehicles in a dynamic adversarial reach–avoid scenario with two noncooperative vehicles and their competitive objectives: 1) “reaching a target and avoiding the other vehicle” for one of them, called attacker, and 2) “protecting the target and capturing the opponent vehicle” for the other one, called defender. In the proposed solution, first, a discrete version of the problem is formulated and solved using linear temporal logic, temporal games, and $\mu$-calculus to construct winning discrete strategies that guarantee safety and reachability. A comprehensive discussion on the existence, correctness, and complexity analysis of the solution is also provided. Finally, a novel correct-by-design hybrid controller is designed to generate smooth control signals that preserve the satisfaction of safety and reachability.	https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9847024	0
A Systematic Literature Review on Automotive Digital Forensics: Challenges, Technical Solutions and Data Collection	A modern vehicle has a complex internal architecture and is wirelessly connected to the Internet, other vehicles, and the infrastructure. The risk of cyber attacks and other criminal incidents along with recent road accidents caused by autonomous vehicles calls for more research on automotive digital forensics. Failures in automated driving functions can be caused by hardware and software failures and cyber security issues. Thus, it is imperative to be able to determine and investigate the cause of these failures, something which requires trustable data. However, automotive digital forensics is a relatively new field for the automotive where most existing self-monitoring and diagnostic systems in vehicles only monitor safety-related events. To the best of our knowledge, our work is the first systematic literature review on the current research within this field. We identify and assess over 300 papers published between 2006–2021 and further map the relevant papers to different categories based on identified focus areas to give a comprehensive overview of the forensics field and the related research activities. Moreover, we identify forensically relevant data from the literature, link the data to categories, and further map them to required security properties and potential stakeholders. Our categorization makes it easy for practitioners and researchers to quickly find relevant work within a particular sub-field of digital forensics. We believe our contributions can guide digital forensic investigations in automotive and similar areas, such as cyber-physical systems and smart cities, facilitate further research, and serve as a guideline for engineers implementing forensics mechanisms.	https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9815132	0
Joint Optimization of Resource Allocation and Flight Trajectory for UAV-IoT Underwater Detecting Systems	In a marine underwater object detecting system, sonobuoys collect underwater acoustic data and then wirelessly transmit it to an agile and controllable unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV), which, in turn, relays the raw data to the terrestrial computing center for further processing. However, constrained by the limitations in communication bandwidth and vehicle maneuverability, the UAV cannot fly over each sonobuoy to gather all the raw data within the prescribed period. In addition, to effectively detect the underwater object, we should also exploit diverse acoustical measurements of different sonobuoys (e.g., triangulation scheme) and maintain a certain level of throughput fairness among sonobuoys. Consequently, for efficient detection, both the bandwidth allocation and flight trajectory must be jointly optimized according to the importance of each sonobuoy. To this end, based on the α-fairness utility function, we design a bandwidth allocation strategy that assigns radio resource to a sonobuoy according to its weight. Similarly, in each searching round, the flying trajectory is also repeatedly optimized thus reducing the communication distances of those important sonobuoys. Moreover, in the proposed strategies, the weight of each sonobuoy and the α value are iteratively updated, which can progressively allow the UAV to fly more closely to those important sonobuoys to collect more effective data, thus significantly expediting the detecting process. Extensive simulation results have demonstrated the effectiveness of our proposed strategy, in that, compared with the benchmark strategies, it can detect underwater objects faster and more accurately.	https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=10172312	0
Lightweight Trustworthy Message Exchange in Unmanned Aerial Vehicle Networks	Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) networks have huge potential for a variety of military and civilian uses, such as intelligent transportation system, smart city, and so on. The 6th Generation (6G) communication technology is expected to provide 3-Dimensional (3D) wireless coverage and greatly improve the performance of UAV networks. The UAV-to-UAV (U2U) message exchange (or message exchange for short) is an important basis of multi-UAV cooperation. However, due to the unique characteristics of UAV networks, the U2U messages (or messages for short) are vulnerable to both the external and internal attackers. In this work, we propose a Lightweight Trustworthy Message Exchange (LTME) scheme for UAV networks by efficiently aggregating the cryptography and trust management technologies. In the LTME scheme, a centralized Ground Control Station (GCS) periodically updates the reputation levels of registered UAVs (or UAVs for short) and securely distributes secret values to the UAVs. Based on the received secret values, each trustworthy broadcasting UAV can generate its encrypted messages so that only trustworthy receiving UAVs can decrypt them, and each trustworthy receiving UAV can accurately judge whether the received messages and the corresponding broadcasting UAVs are trustworthy in a lightweight manner. Furthermore, we present a simplified LTME (sLTME) scheme and conduct a comprehensive theoretical analysis and simulation evaluation for the LTME and sLTME schemes. The results demonstrate that the proposed schemes can provide rich functionality and strong robustness with low computation and communication overheads, and are significantly superior to the existing schemes in several aspects.	https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9660778	0
Event-Triggered Adaptive Security Path Following Control for Unmanned Ground Vehicles Under Sensor Attacks	This paper is concerned with the event-triggered adaptive security control (ET-ASC) for the path following of networked unmanned ground vehicles (UGVs) subject to sensor attacks. Firstly, a security model is well established to capture the dynamics of path following control of UGVs under sensor attacks. Then, the ET-ASC with respect to correction signal is proposed to mitigate the effects of such sensor attacks. In what follows, two theorems, which include both input to state stability (ISS) criterion and controller design method, are carefully derived for the path following control of UGVs under the proposed ET-ASC scheme. The advantage of the proposed ET-ASC scheme lies in that it can actively amend the sensor attacks in an adaptive way and exclude Zeno phenomenon naturally. At last, a verification simulation experiment are conducted to show the effectiveness of the proposed ET-ASC method.	https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=10056976	0
Secure and Efficient UAV Tracking in Space-Air-Ground Integrated Network	With the development of 5G and other communication techniques, the space-air-ground integrated network (SAGIN) is regarded as a promising solution to provide wide-range, cost-effective, and real-time wireless access. Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) Tracking plays a crucial role in guaranteeing the performance of SAGIN. However, UAV tracking still faces a series of challenges in the real-world deployment, especially in the case of the presence of malicious attackers, who may launch a series of attacks (e.g., message spoofing attack, routing misbehavior attack) to disrupt the systems. In this study, to enhance the security and efficiency of SAGIN when conducting object tracking, we propose a novel and secure object tracking system named SecTracker to overcome the emerging security problems in the SAGIN. Focusing on the unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) tracking, we design the Local Voting based Detection Module to defend the message spoofing attack and implement the Routing Evidence based Detection Module to defend the routing misbehavior attack. Besides, efficiency enhancement mechanisms (i.e., probabilistic detection algorithm and game theory based algorithm) are proposed in this paper to improve the efficiency of SecTracker. Considering the above-mentioned attacks, the overall tracking accuracy is improved from 88.16% in existing schemes to 96.64% in SecTracker, which demonstrates the effectiveness of the proposed system.	https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=10064000	0
Communication and Cooperation for Spherical Underwater Robots by Using Acoustic Transmission	The application of miniature underwater robots in the marine area is becoming more extensive. Occasionally, the ability of the single miniature underwater robot is limited by its size, configuration, function or propulsion method. At this moment, if a group of robots can work together in a division of labor, that can solve more problems underwater. For autonomous underwater vehicles, the support of underwater wireless communication equipment is required to achieve communication and collaboration. Acoustic communication equipment has generally been used in large underwater vehicles due to its large size and power. This article employs a small acoustic communication module to enable underwater communication in a spherical robot with a diameter of only 45 cm. The fourth-generation spherical underwater robot is exploited as the prototype. The article also verifies the accuracy, efficiency and timeliness of the proposed underwater communication systems. Finally, a cooperative mode is established based on the base station, master robot and slave robots, and some cooperation motion experiments are carried out to verify its effectiveness. Early work on this article was presented at the IEEE ICMA 2018 conference S. Gu et al., 2018. In this conference article, the authors only provided theoretical research and a small number of experiments. On this basis, this article has conducted in-depth research, proposed a base station-mater-slave robot communication mode, and established an instruction set for further experiments.	https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9882972	0
Continual Barlow Twins: Continual Self-Supervised Learning for Remote Sensing Semantic Segmentation	In the field of earth observation (EO), continual learning (CL) algorithms have been proposed to deal with large datasets by decomposing them into several subsets and processing them incrementally. The majority of these algorithms assume that data are, first, coming from a single source, and second, fully labeled. Real-world EO datasets are instead characterized by a large heterogeneity (e.g., coming from aerial, satellite, or drone scenarios), and for the most part they are unlabeled, meaning they can be fully exploited only through the emerging self-supervised learning (SSL) paradigm. For these reasons, in this article, we present a new algorithm for merging SSL and CL for remote sensing applications that we call continual Barlow twins. It combines the advantages of one of the simplest self-supervision techniques, i.e., Barlow twins, with the elastic weight consolidation method to avoid catastrophic forgetting. In addition, we evaluate the proposed continual SSL approach on a highly heterogeneous EO dataset, showing the effectiveness of this strategy on a novel combination of three almost non-overlapping domains datasets (airborne Potsdam, satellite US3D, and drone unmanned aerial vehicle semantic segmentation dataset), on a crucial downstream task in EO, i.e., semantic segmentation. Encouraging results show the superiority of SSL in this setting, and the effectiveness of creating an incremental effective pretrained feature extractor, based on ResNet50, without the need of relying on the complete availability of all the data, with a valuable saving of time and resources.	https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=10135093	0
UAV Trajectory and Multi-User Beamforming Optimization for Clustered Users Against Passive Eavesdropping Attacks With Unknown CSI	This article tackles the fundamental passive eavesdropping problem in modern wireless communications in which the location and the channel state information (CSI) of the attackers are unknown. In this regard, we propose deploying an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) that serves as a mobile aerial relay (AR) to help ground base station (GBS) support a subset of vulnerable users. More precisely, our solution (1) clusters the single-antenna users in two groups to be either served by the GBS directly or via the AR, (2) employs optimal multi-user beamforming to the directly served users, and (3) optimizes the AR's 3D position, its multi-user beamforming matrix and transmit powers by combining closed-form solutions with machine learning techniques. Specifically, we design a plain beamforming and power optimization combined with a deep reinforcement learning (DRL) algorithm for an AR to optimize its trajectory for the security maximization of the served users. Numerical results show that the multi-user multiple input, single output (MU-MISO) system split between a GBS and an AR with optimized transmission parameters without knowledge of the eavesdropping channels achieves high secrecy capacities that scale well with increasing the number of users. Index Terms: UAV-assisted, beamforming, DRL, eavesdropping, MU-MISO, physical layer security, power control, trajectory optimization.	https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=10153699	0
Combat situation suppression of multiple UAVs based on spatiotemporal cooperative path planning	Aiming at the suppression of enemy air defense (SEAD) task under the complex and complicated combat scenario, the spatiotemporal cooperative path planning methods are studied in this paper. The major research contents include optimal path points generation, path smoothing and cooperative rendezvous. In the path points generation part, the path points availability testing algorithm and the path segments availability testing algorithm are designed, on this foundation, the swarm intelligence-based path point generation algorithm is utilized to generate the optimal path. In the path smoothing part, taking terminal attack angle constraint and maneuverability constraint into consideration, the Dubins curve is introduced to smooth the path segments. In cooperative rendezvous part, we take estimated time of arrival requirement constraint and flight speed range constraint into consideration, the speed control strategy and flight path control strategy are introduced, further, the decoupling scheme of the circling maneuver and detouring maneuver is designed, in this case, the maneuver ways, maneuver point, maneuver times, maneuver path and flight speed are determined. Finally, the simulation experiments are conducted and the acquired results reveal that the time-space cooperation of multiple unmanned aeriel vehicles (UAVs) is effectively realized, in this way, the combat situation suppression against the enemy can be realized in SEAD scenarios.	https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=10308760	0
Lightweight Encryption and Authentication for Controller Area Network of Autonomous Vehicles	With the rapid development of autonomous vehicles (AVs), vehicle safety has attracted attention. Controller area network (CAN) bus without authentication and encryption mechanisms is a weakness of the in-vehicle network (IVN), and attackers always primarily target the CAN bus. Attacks on the AVs' CAN bus are more frequent because AVs have more external interfaces and sensors than ordinary vehicles. To address the abovementioned issues, this paper proposes a lightweight encryption and authentication scheme for the CAN bus of AVs using message authentication codes and Grain stream cipher. The scheme realizes efficient authentication between electronic control units and a counter re-synchronization protocol is used to ensure that authentication failure owing to counter inconsistency is prevented. Blom key management scheme is employed to rapidly distribute and update session keys, avoiding the complicated process of updating pairwise keys. In addition, considering the scalability of the IVN, a key distribution protocol for new nodes was provided. The security proof using Burrows-Abadi-Needham logic and security analysis prove that the proposed scheme can satisfy the security requirements of the IVN. In addition, performance analysis shows that the proposed scheme can meet real-time requirements and has little impact on the busload.	https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=10138618	0
Lifelong Vehicle Trajectory Prediction Framework Based on Generative Replay	Accurate trajectory prediction of vehicles is essential for reliable autonomous driving. To maintain consistent performance as a vehicle driving around different cities, it is crucial to adapt to changing traffic circumstances and achieve lifelong trajectory prediction model. To realize it, catastrophic forgetting is a main problem to be addressed. In this paper, a divergence measurement method based on conditional Kullback-Leibler divergence is proposed first to evaluate spatiotemporal dependency difference among varied driving circumstances. Then based on generative replay, a novel lifelong vehicle trajectory prediction framework is developed. The framework consists of a conditional generation model and a vehicle trajectory prediction model. The conditional generation model is a generative adversarial network conditioned on position configuration of vehicles. After learning and merging trajectory distribution of vehicles across different cities, the generation model replays trajectories with prior samplings as inputs, which alleviates catastrophic forgetting. The vehicle trajectory prediction model is trained by the replayed trajectories and achieves consistent prediction performance on visited cities. A lifelong experiment setup is established on four open datasets including five tasks. Spatiotemporal dependency divergence is calculated for different tasks. Even though these divergence, the proposed framework exhibits lifelong learning ability and achieves consistent performance on all tasks.	https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=10214197	0
Autonomous Unwrapping of General Pallets: A Novel Robot for Logistics Exploiting Contact-Based Planning	In recent years, robotics has been largely applied to improve the efficiency of logistic processes. Pallets cover a crucial role in the logistic flow, since they represent the main way to store and ship items. When put onto pallets, the items are wrapped with plastic films to protect them and prevent them from falling. Despite being the first and necessary operation for handling the stacked goods, unwrapping—the task of removing the plastic films wrapped around the goods—has not yet been satisfactorily automated. We propose the first robotic solution for autonomous unwrapping of generally shaped pallets, including both homogeneous and heterogeneous pallets. Force and torque measurements are exploited to retrieve information on the collisions between the end-effector and the wrapped items or the plastic film. Based on the contact information, we design a novel reactive planning strategy that makes the unwrapping task effective and robust on pallets with uncertain position or shape. We present the results of an extensive experimental campaign to validate the proposed method. Note to Practitioners—This work is motivated by the fact that unwrapping machines are not yet common on the market. The few commercial examples are usually bulky machines that lack the flexibility to adapt to different and irregularly shaped pallets. Thus, the crucial operation of removing the plastic film around palletized goods is still mainly performed by hand. Blade handling, ladders, and electrostatic shocks are sources of potential injury. We propose a flexible, autonomous unwrapping robot suitable for both cuboid and irregularly shaped pallets. The robot is composed of a robotic arm, a custom cutting end-effector, a vision module, and a suitable planning and control unit. The reduced dimensions allow it to be mounted on a mobile base. The robot has been successfully tested on different pallet configurations. However, extensive testing in real-world scenarios should be carried out to assess both reliability and time efficiency in more realistic working conditions. Moreover, real pallets can reach considerable heights. Thus, a prismatic joint should be integrated to address such cases. Finally, unwrapping in the presence of typical plastic straps and different types of film, e.g., the shrink one, is to be evaluated.	https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9801631	0
Deep Active Learning Intrusion Detection and Load Balancing in Software-Defined Vehicular Networks	Software-defined vehicular networks (SDVN) can help analyze and reconfigure networks. Massive data generation in autonomous vehicles can lead to issues in network configuration, routing, network characteristics, and system load factors. Load balancing in vehicle sensors helps reduce delays and improve resource utilization. In this paper, we propose a load balancing algorithm to map sensor data, vehicles and data centers performing tasks. A dynamic convergence method is proposed to help identify vehicle system load factors and compare their termination criteria. We also propose a packet-level intrusion detection model. After all load balancing, the model can track the attack on the network. The proposed model further combines the entropy-based active learning and the attention-based model to efficiently identify the attacks. Experiments are then conducted on the standard KDD data to validate the developed models with and without an attention-based active learning mechanism. Our experimental results show that the load balancing mechanism is able to achieve more performance gains than previous techniques. Moreover, the results show that the developed model can improve the decision boundary by using a pooling strategy and an entropy uncertainty measure.	https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9764665	0
Distributed Graph-Based Optimization of Multicast Data Dissemination for Internet of Vehicles	The Internet of Vehicles (IoV) is a promising paradigm for autonomous driving, where the sensing data from the onboard sensors can be disseminated and processed cooperatively via vehicle-to-vehicle links. Autonomous vehicles can share their local views for cooperative, reliable, and robust driving decisions. However, the limited wireless resources may become the bottleneck with the increasing number of vehicles. The technical challenges also arise from the decentralized control, the spatial couplings of decisions, and the complexity of combinatorial optimization. This paper proposes a novel fully distributed graph-based approach to jointly optimize multicast link establishment with data dissemination and processing decisions by only exchanging partial information among neighboring vehicles. The mixed-integer programming problem aims to maximize system energy efficiency while achieving maximum data throughput. We prove that maximizing data processing throughput is submodular optimization to find the local optimum efficiently. The optimization of data dissemination and processing is reformulated to a minimum-cost maximum-flow problem in a three-layer graph, and efficiently solved by exploiting the graphical interdependence. Both simulation-generated and trace-based datasets are evaluated to validate the effectiveness of the proposed approach in terms of data throughput and energy efficiency.	https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9989340	0
Resilient Path Planning of Unmanned Aerial Vehicles Against Covert Attacks on Ultrawideband Sensors	In this article, a resilient path planning scheme is proposed to navigate an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) to its planned (nominal) destination with minimum energy consumption in the presence of a strategic attacker. The UAV is equipped with the following two sensors: 1) a GPS sensor, which is vulnerable to spoofing attacks; 2) a well-functioning ultrawideband (UWB) sensor, which is possible to be deceived. It is shown that a covert attacker can significantly deviate the UAV's path without being detected by the UWB sensor by simultaneously corrupting the GPS signals and forging control inputs. The prerequisite for the attack occurrence is first discussed. Based on this prerequisite, an optimal attack scheme is proposed, which maximizes the deviation between the nominal destination and the real one. Correspondingly, an energy-efficient and resilient navigation scheme based on Pontryagin's maximum principle is formulated, which suppresses the above covert attacker effectively. Essentially, this problem can be seen as a Stackelberg game between a resilient path planner (defender) and a covert attacker. The effectiveness of our theoretical results is illustrated via two simulation examples.	https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=10036104	0
Joint mission and route planning of unmanned air vehicles via a learning-based heuristic	Unmanned air vehicles (UAVs) have been regularly employed in modern wars to conduct different missions. Instead of addressing mission planning and route planning separately, this study investigates the issue of joint mission and route planning for a fleet of UAVs. The mission planning determines the configuration of weapons in UAVs and the weapons to attack targets, while the route planning determines the UAV's visiting sequence for the targets. The problem is formulated as an integer linear programming model. Due to the inefficiency of CPLEX on large scale optimization problems, an effective learning-based heuristic, namely, population based adaptive large neighborhood search (P-ALNS), is proposed to solve the model. In P-ALNS, seven neighborhood structures are designed and adaptively utilized in terms of their historical performance. The effectiveness and superiority of the proposed model and algorithm are demonstrated on test instances of small, medium and large sizes. In particular, P-ALNS achieves comparable solutions or as good as those of CPLEX on small-size (20 targets) instances in much shorter time.	https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=10018314	0
A Data-Driven Cyber–Physical System Using Deep-Learning Convolutional Neural Networks: Study on False-Data Injection Attacks in an Unmanned Ground Vehicle Under Fault-Tolerant Conditions	Leveraging the benefits of deep-learning convolutional neural networks, we introduce a new data-driven cyber–physical system specifically designed to address the vulnerability of middleware software, namely, Robot Operating System (ROS), widely implemented in robotics in both civilian and military domains. As for our research platform, we employ the GVR-BOT unmanned ground vehicle, which is a replicate of the U.S. Army ground robot. We focus our study on the ability of the ground robot to operate under fault-tolerant conditions, making it challenging from the standpoint of cybersecurity to differentiate between legitimate and malicious operations. The GVR-BOT ground vehicle belongs to a class of differential drive ground robots and employs ROS in its onboard computer to interact with users. To facilitate deep learning, we develop a large database of images based on the network-traffic data of ROS, describing the dynamics of the GVR-BOT ground robot under legitimate and malicious operations. We use our image database to train and validate the performance of our deep-learning CNN system. Given a set of RGB/grayscale images describing the normalized time-series data representing the dynamics of the GVR-BOT ground robot, the objective of our proposed cybersecurity algorithm is to safeguard the legitimate operation of the ground robot under fault-tolerant conditions, such that any attempts to compromise its performance (e.g., malicious attacks) can be prevented within the minimum detection time. Our research indicates a promising result as our system is capable of detecting malicious attacks with high accuracy while recognizing its legitimate operations with reasonably small false-positive rates.	https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9812734	0
On-Board Deep-Learning-Based Unmanned Aerial Vehicle Fault Cause Detection and Classification via FPGAs	With the increase in the use of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs)/drones, it is important to detect and identify causes of failure in real time for proper recovery from a potential crash-like scenario or postincident forensics analysis. The cause of crash could be either a fault in the sensor/actuator system, a physical damage/attack, or a cyber attack on the drone's software. In this work, we propose novel architectures based on deep convolutional and long short-term memory neural networks to detect (via autoencoder) and classify drone misoperations based on real-time sensor data. The proposed architectures are able to learn high-level features automatically from the raw sensor data. Empirical results show that our solution is able to detect (with over 90% accuracy) and classify various types of drone misoperations [with about 99% accuracy (simulation data) and up to 85% accuracy (experimental data)]. Furthermore, with the help of field programmable gate array-based hardware acceleration, we achieved a speedup of 40x ($\sim\!\text{2.6 ms}$) for detection, while consuming half the amount of power compared with onboard GPU devices, such as NVIDIA Jetson TX2.	https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=10122168	0
A Learning-Based Nonlinear Model Predictive Controller for a Real Go-Kart Based on Black-Box Dynamics Modeling Through Gaussian Processes	Lately, nonlinear model predictive control (NMPC) has been successfully applied to (semi-) autonomous driving problems and has proven to be a very promising technique. However, accurate control models for real vehicles could require costly and time-demanding specific measurements. To address this problem, the exploitation of system data to complement or derive the prediction model of the NMPC has been explored, employing learning dynamics approaches within learning-based NMPC (LbNMPC). Its application to the automotive field has focused on discrete gray-box modeling, in which a nominal dynamics model is enhanced by the data-driven component. In this manuscript, we present an LbNMPC controller for a real go-kart based on a continuous black-box model of the accelerations obtained by Gaussian processes (GP). We show the effectiveness of the proposed approach by testing the controller on a real go-kart vehicle, highlighting the approximation steps required to get an exploitable GP model on a real-time application.	https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=10185938	0
Fixed-Time Resilient Edge-Triggered Estimation and Control of Surface Vehicles for Cooperative Target Tracking Under Attacks	This paper is concerned with the cooperative target tracking of under-actuated unmanned surface vehicles (USVs) with event-triggered communications subject to denial-of-service (DoS) attacks. The target position information can be sensed by a fraction of follower USVs only. A fixed-time resilient cooperative edge-triggered estimation and control architecture is presented for achieving cooperative target tracking under DoS attacks. Specifically, a distributed edge-triggered fixed-time extended state observer (ESO) is designed to recover the position and velocity of the target with a prescribed time regardless of the unreliable communication network subject to DoS attacks. Moreover, the communication burden of the network is reduced by the proposed edge-triggered mechanism. In the control law design, a fixed-time ESO is designed for estimating the model uncertainties and external disturbances in an earth-fixed reference frame. Then, a fixed-time target tracking control law is proposed for each follower USV based on the fixed-time ESO. It is proven that the error signals in the closed-loop control system of USVs are convergent to the origin in a fixed time. An example is provided to substantiate the effectiveness of the proposed fixed-time resilient cooperative edge-triggered estimation and control architecture for USVs.	https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9799547	0
Optimal Design of Flexible-Link Mechanisms With Desired Load-Displacement Profiles	Robot mechanisms that exploit compliance can perform complex tasks under uncertainty using simple control strategies, but it remains difficult to design mechanisms with a desired embodied intelligence. In this article, we propose an automated design technique that optimizes the desired load-displacement behavior of planar flexible-link mechanisms. To do so, we replace a subset of rigid with flexible links in an existing mechanism, and optimize their rest shape. We demonstrate the efficacy of our approach on a set of examples, including two fabricated prototypes, illustrating applications for grasping and locomotion tasks.	https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=10138669	0
Distributed Subspace Projection Graph Signal Estimation With Anomaly Interference	The estimation of graph signal is a vital problem in many distributed networks, such as vehicular networks, smart grids, unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), and the Internet of Things. In those networks, anomaly interference widely exists, such as network attack, noise, device fault, which will hazard the healthy of the entire system. In the article, the estimation of graph signals with anomaly interference is investigated. We show that the graph signal estimation problem can be treated as a bandlimited subspace optimization problem, and propose a distributed subspace projection graph signal estimation algorithm based on the graph filter (DispGF), which can achieve better performance with less communication burden. In addition, a graph filter matrix that produces subspace projection is proposed to replace the nonsparse projection matrix, which guarantees distributed implementation and projection accuracy. Different from previous work, here, graph signal estimation is studied with no prior anomaly information. To this end, for FDI attack, random attack, noise interference, we propose anomaly detection and node localization scheme based on smoothness, that can achieve similar performance compared with the case of prior anomaly information known. Numerical experiments verify the effectiveness of the proposed DispGF algorithm. The convergence of the algorithm is theoretically analyzed.	https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=10123952	0
CARE: Confidence-Rich Autonomous Robot Exploration Using Bayesian Kernel Inference and Optimization	In this letter, we consider improving the efficiency of information-based autonomous robot exploration in unknown and complex environments. We first utilize Gaussian process (GP) regression to learn a surrogate model to infer the confidence-rich mutual information (CRMI) of querying control actions, then adopt an objective function consisting of predicted CRMI values and prediction uncertainties to conduct Bayesian optimization (BO), i.e., GP-based BO (GPBO). The trade-off between the best action with the highest CRMI value (exploitation) and the action with high prediction variance (exploration) can be realized. To further improve the efficiency of GPBO, we propose a novel lightweight information gain inference method based on Bayesian kernel inference and optimization (BKIO), achieving an approximate logarithmic complexity without the need for training. BKIO can also infer the CRMI and generate the best action using BO with bounded cumulative regret, which ensures its comparable accuracy to GPBO with much higher efficiency. Extensive numerical and real-world experiments show the desired efficiency of our proposed methods without losing exploration performance in different unstructured, cluttered environments.	https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=10243037	0
Deep Learning-Based Anomaly Detection for Connected Autonomous Vehicles Using Spatiotemporal Information	Although connected mymargin autonomous vehicles (CAVs) hold great potential to improve driving safety and experience significantly, cybersecurity remains a critical concern. As the de-facto standard for in-vehicle networks, the Controller Area Network (CAN) carries messages and commands vital to the operation of the vehicle. However, due to a lack of security mechanisms, intruders are able to conduct devastating attacks on drivers and passengers over CAN. In order to safeguard CAVs, an Intrusion Detection System (IDS) can be deployed to monitor CAN network activities and detect suspicious behavior resulting from an attack. This paper proposes a prediction-based IDS framework for detecting anomalies and attacks on a CAN bus using temporal correlation of message contents. Two candidates are introduced as the prediction module. The first network is an LSTM that predicts time series data separately for each CAN ID, and the second is a ConvLSTM that predicts messages using correlated data of several CAN IDs. An attack is classified according to prediction errors by a Gaussian Naïve Bayes classifier. The proposed IDS is evaluated against other state-of-the-art one-class classifiers, including OCSVM, Isolation Forest, and Autoencoder, and three existing works, including ReducedInception-ResNet, NeuroCAN, and CANLite, using a real-world dataset, the Car Hacking Dataset. A comparison between the two suggested architectures and their use cases is given. Compared to baseline methods and related studies, the proposed method is shown to be more accurate and can achieve F-scores and detection accuracy of almost 100%.	https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=10164214	0
Gated Adversarial Network Based Environmental Enhancement Method for Driving Safety Under Adverse Weather Conditions	The adverse weather conditions have brought considerable difficulties in vision-based applications, which are closely related to the driving safety of autonomous vehicles. However, to date, the greater part of the existing environmental perception studies are under ordinary conditions, and the method to deal with the adverse weather conditions was ignored. Hence, this paper proposes an all-in-one gated adversarial network (AIO-GAN) to improve the performance of vision-based environment perception algorithms under adverse weather conditions, including in rain, haze, lack of light, etc. Three key technical contributions are made. At first, the deep learning based gated transformer module was proposed to classify the input mixed images to different collections by passing them through different branches. Second, the multi-branch based variational autoencoder-generative adversarial network was proposed to solve the ill-pose problem of the solution. Third, high-level weight sharing encoders was given out to guarantee the stability and the high quality of the training process. In this way, the unified clean-style images can be achieved, even if the mixed multi-modal images are transferred from the source domain of complex weather scenes. Extensive experimental results show that the proposed method has achieved better performance than state-of-the-arts and improved the accuracy of target detection.	https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9677938	0
WKN-OC: A New Deep Learning Method for Anomaly Detection in Intelligent Vehicles	Connected and automated vehicles (CAVs) play a vital role in transforming human mobility, tackling road congestion and road safety. However, CAVs rely heavily on the security, accuracy, and stability of sensor readings and network data. Abnormal sensor readings caused by malicious cyberattacks or faulty car sensors can have devastating consequences, possibly even lead to a fatal crash. In order to avoid the CAVs data anomalies caused by network attacks or data failures, we propose a Wavelet Kernel Network with Omni-Scale Convolutional (WKN-OC) for anomaly detection in intelligent transportation systems (ITS), which can select the optimal scale adaptively and processes high-frequency signals better. The proposed method pays more attention to the high-frequency components of input data, and fully extracts valuable features through the feature extraction framework, so that the model has strong anomaly detection performance. We verify the reliability of the WKN-OC method on the Safe Pilot Model Deployment (SPMD) data set. It is shown that the proposed WKN-OC model has good detection performance for various anomaly data, especially in the mixed anomaly experiment. We have achieved 96.78% average accuracy in mixed anomaly experiments and 96.13% accuracy in multi anomaly experiments. The results show that the model has strong generalization performance for the anomaly detection problem faced by the Internet of Vehicles (IoVs) and can identify the unknown anomalies in reality well.	https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=10041752	0
Learned Inertial Odometry for Autonomous Drone Racing	Inertial odometry is an attractive solution to the problem of state estimation for agile quadrotor flight. It is inexpensive, lightweight, and it is not affected by perceptual degradation. However, only relying on the integration of the inertial measurements for state estimation is infeasible. The errors and time-varying biases present in such measurements cause the accumulation of large drift in the pose estimates. Recently, inertial odometry has made significant progress in estimating the motion of pedestrians. State-of-the-art algorithms rely on learning a motion prior that is typical of humans but cannot be transferred to drones. In this work, we propose a learning-based odometry algorithm that uses an inertial measurement unit (IMU) as the only sensor modality for autonomous drone racing tasks. The core idea of our system is to couple a model-based filter, driven by the inertial measurements, with a learning-based module that has access to the thrust measurements. We show that our inertial odometry algorithm is superior to the state-of-the-art filter-based and optimization-based visual-inertial odometry as well as the state-of-the-art learned-inertial odometry in estimating the pose of an autonomous racing drone. Additionally, we show that our system is comparable to a visual-inertial odometry solution that uses a camera and exploits the known gate location and appearance. We believe that the application in autonomous drone racing paves the way for novel research in inertial odometry for agile quadrotor flight.	https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=10058169	0
Implementation of Autonomous Docking and Charging for a Supporting Robotic Fish	Underwater energy supplements for autonom- ous underwater vehicles (AUVs) are significant for ocean exploitation owing to energy storage and data communication limitations. Aiming at the energy supplement for bionic robotic fish, an autonomous recharging-oriented docking approach is proposed in this article. First, an omnidirectional docking system containing a supporting robotic fish capable of visual recognition and wireless charging and a docking platform is presented. Next, five locomotive modes are designed and analyzed based on the hybrid swimming and gliding patterns for the robot fish. Utilizing the five modes, a docking procedure is planned, and an onboard-visual-based autonomous docking control strategy is presented. Aquatic experiments, including docking with the platform and refloating a small robot, are performed to verify the effectiveness of the proposed approach. The obtained results offer valuable insights into the development of autonomous docking of bionic robots, laying a solid foundation for the permanent operation of various underwater devices and robots.	https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9870627	0
Two-Layer-Based Multiarms Bilateral Teleoperation Architecture	In this article, we propose a novel bilateral teleoperation architecture for a multiarms system based on the two-layer approach. Exploiting the concept of shared energy tank, a passivity layer guarantees the passivity of the overall architecture with respect to destabilizing factors such as time delays in the communication channel. The desired behavior can then be freely designed in the transparency layer. The formulation of the energy tank is first revised, allowing a more efficient use of energy, and then extended, allowing explicitly the use of both admittance and impedance causality robots. A novel framework capable of combining the use of teleoperated and autonomous robots is proposed. The architecture has been tested and validated on a multiarms system in a realistic surgical scenario with the da Vinci research kit (dVRK) and an autonomous arm holding the endoscope.	https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9987687	0
Attribute-Based Data Sharing Scheme With Flexible Search Functionality for Cloud-Assisted Autonomous Transportation System	The existing group public key encryption with equality test schemes could only support one-to-one data sharing and are not suitable for cloud-assisted autonomous transportation systems, which demand one-to-many data sharing. To tackle this problem efficiently, in this article, we put forward the group-attribute-based encryption with equality test (G-ABEET) scheme. The presented G-ABEET allows sensors equipped in vehicles to encrypt traffic data with an expressive access policy before sharing it. Only users with attributes required by the access policy ought to access the shared ciphertexts, thus achieving selective one-to-many data sharing. Meanwhile, the authorized cloud server could provide group users with equality tests over the ciphertexts, realizing ciphertext search ability. Furthermore, with the group mechanism, the G-ABEET scheme could resist offline message recovery attacks. Besides, in the standard model, we give rigorous security proof of the G-ABEET construction. The feasibility and efficiency of G-ABEET are demonstrated by experimental simulations.	https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=10038533	0
Adversarial Blur-Deblur Network for Robust UAV Tracking	Unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) tracking has been widely applied in real-world applications such as surveillance and monitoring. However, the inherent high maneuverability and agility of UAV often lead to motion blur, which can impair the visual appearance of the target object and easily degrade the existing trackers. To overcome this challenge, this work proposes a tracking-oriented adversarial blur-deblur network (ABDNet), composed of a novel deblurrer to recover the visual appearance of the tracked object, and a brand-new blur generator to produce realistic blurry images for adversarial training. More specifically, the deblurrer progressively refines the features through pixel-wise, spatial-wise, and channel-wise stages to achieve excellent deblurring performance. The blur generator adaptively fuses an image sequence with a learnable kernel to create realistic blurry images. During training, ABDNet is plugged into the state-of-the-art real-time trackers and trained with blurring-deblurring loss as well as tracking loss. During inference, the blur generator is removed, while the deblurrer and the tracker can work together for UAV tracking. Extensive experiments in both public datasets and real-world testing have validated the effectiveness of ABDNet.	https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=10015799	0
IIDS: Intelligent Intrusion Detection System for Sustainable Development in Autonomous Vehicles	Connected and Autonomous Vehicles (CAVs) enable various capabilities and functionalities like automated driving assistance, navigation and path planning, cruise control, independent decision making, and low-carbon transportation in the real-time environment. However, the increased CAVs usage renders the potential vulnerabilities in the Internet of Vehicles (IoV) environment, making it susceptible to cyberattacks. An Intrusion Detection System (IDS) is a technique to report network assaults by potential Autonomous Vehicles (AVs) without encryption and authorization procedures for internal and external vehicular communications. This paper proposes an Intelligent IDS (IIDS) to enhance intrusion detection and categorize malicious AVs using a modified Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) with hyperparameter optimization approaches for IoV systems. The proposed IIDS framework works in a 5G Vehicle-to-Everything (V2X) environment to effectively broadcast messages about malicious AVs. Thus IIDS aids in preventing collisions and chaos, enhancing safety monitoring in the traffic. The experimental results depict that the proposed IIDS achieves 98% accuracy in detecting attacks.	https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=10144487	0
Blockchain-Enabled Authenticated Key Agreement Scheme for Mobile Vehicles-Assisted Precision Agricultural IoT Networks	Precision farming has a positive potential in the agricultural industry regarding water conservation, increased productivity, better development of rural areas, and increased income. Blockchain technology is a better alternative for storing and sharing farm data as it is reliable, transparent, immutable, and decentralized. Remote monitoring of an agricultural field requires security systems to ensure that any sensitive information is exchanged only among authenticated entities in the network. To this end, we design an efficient blockchain-enabled authenticated key agreement scheme for mobile vehicles-assisted precision agricultural Internet of Things (IoT) networks called  $AgroMobiBlock$ . The limited existing work on authentication in agricultural networks shows passive usage of blockchains with very high costs.  $AgroMobiBlock$  proposes a novel idea using the elliptic curve operations on an active hybrid blockchain over mobile farming vehicles with low computation and communication costs. Formal and informal security analysis along with the formal security verification using the Automated Validation of Internet Security Protocols and Applications (AVISPA) software tool have shown the robustness of  $AgroMobiBlock$  against man-in-the-middle, impersonation, replay, physical capture, and ephemeral secret leakage attacks among other potential attacks. The blockchain-based simulation on large-scale nodes shows the computational time for an increase in the network and block sizes. Moreover, the real-time testbed experiments have been performed to show the practical usefulness of the proposed scheme.	https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9994772	0
Deep Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning for Highway On-Ramp Merging in Mixed Traffic	On-ramp merging is a challenging task for autonomous vehicles (AVs), especially in mixed traffic where AVs coexist with human-driven vehicles (HDVs). In this paper, we formulate the mixed-traffic highway on-ramp merging problem as a multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) problem, where the AVs (on both merge lane and through lane) collaboratively learn a policy to adapt to HDVs to maximize the traffic throughput. We develop an efficient and scalable MARL framework that can be used in dynamic traffic where the communication topology could be time-varying. Parameter sharing and local rewards are exploited to foster inter-agent cooperation while achieving great scalability. An action masking scheme is employed to improve learning efficiency by filtering out invalid/unsafe actions at each step. In addition, a novel priority-based safety supervisor is developed to significantly reduce collision rate and greatly expedite the training process. A gym-like simulation environment is developed and open-sourced with three different levels of traffic densities. We exploit curriculum learning to efficiently learn harder tasks from trained models under simpler settings. Comprehensive experimental results show the proposed MARL framework consistently outperforms several state-of-the-art benchmarks.	https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=10159552	0
Non-Conservative Trajectory Planning for Automated Vehicles by Estimating Intentions of Dynamic Obstacles	Motion planning algorithms for urban automated driving must handle uncertainty due to unknown intention and future motion of Dynamic Obstacles (DOs). Considering a single future trajectory for each DO is not adequate, especially in urban frameworks where traffic participants exhibit very different behaviors. However, including multiple candidate trajectories representing different behaviors results in an excess of conservatism. We present a novel combination of the Interactive Multiple Model (IMM) algorithm and Stochastic Model Predictive Control (SMPC) that allows non-conservative safe motion planning in presence of DOs with unknown intention. We introduce a framework based on LQR and IMM to predict multiple candidate future trajectories, each interpreted as a high-level intention that the DO is pursuing, and dynamically estimate their probabilities. Then, the future trajectory of the automated vehicle is iteratively planned in an SMPC fashion, in which collision avoidance constraints are generated for multiple future trajectories of each DO, with a focus on the most likely. Our method improves safe motion planning fully exploiting the benefits of multi-modal predictions of the DOs, avoiding excessive conservatism. Advantages of the proposed method are discussed through simulations in the CARLA environment.	https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=10005857	0
Automatic Vehicle Pollution Detection Using Feedback Based Iterative Deep Learning	Air pollution is one of the major health hazards in modern times. Vehicle pollution is one of the major contributors to aerial contamination. Significant emphasis has been given by the researchers to identify the traffic pollutant sources. However, there is a need for a low-cost, automated solution for fast detection of polluting vehicles from the end of law enforcers. In this article, we have presented a novel deep learning based evaluation strategy that will identify the pollutant vehicle through on- road installed surveillance camera images. An enhanced image data set with notable variations has been prepared for training the models. Thereafter, a multi-model feedback process has been integrated. In contrast to the other deep learning approaches, the proposed framework has started with low labeled training data which is quite relevant in real-life scenarios. Subsequently, the size of the training samples has been increased using feedback. The evaluation of the framework has been performed with seven popular deep learning CNN models, i.e Inception-V3, MobileNet-V2, MobileNet-V3 (small), InceptionResNet-V2, VGG16, VGG19 and XceptionNet. Transfer learning has been exploited to distinguish the on- road pollutants and to provide proper surveillance in transport system. We have compared our method with recent state-of-the-art techniques. The results have demonstrated the superiority of the proposed framework in the road surveillance domain. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first attempt to apply a feedback based iterative deep learning model for vehicle pollution detection.	https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=10034426	0
Editorial: Secure and Safe MetaControl for Cyber Physical Systems	Welcome to the twelfth issue of 2023 in the IEEE/CAA Journal of Automatica Sinica (JAS). In the sixth issue of 2023, I systematically addressed the latest development of Meta Vehicles, and sorted out some important contributions published in the IEEE/CAA JAS focusing on control, estimation, and optimization of automated vehicles with reliability, security, efficiency, and intelligence. When shifting the perspective to cyber-physical systems (CPSs), the styles or paradigms of control and filtering are going through major changes benefiting from the widespread applications of both cloud computing and digital twins. Particularly, the desired performance and management functions of CPSs under the virtual and real framework will be achieved via Metaverse technologies and strict system analysis involving behavior recognition of users, decision-making processes as well as parameter design and optimization. It is evident that the system's performance and cost are synthetic reflections of its behavior in both cyberspace and the real world [1]. This kind of control paradigm can be referred to as MetaControl [2]. It should be pointed out that MetaControl is built upon cyberspace and hence security threats are naturally inherited and inevitably enhanced due to the ever-increasing complexity and diversity of system functionalities while faults in the physical space are also a big concern. As such, new methods of control, filtering, and optimization should be creatively developed to satisfy the requirement of external security in cyberspace and internal safety in the physical space of CPSs.	https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=10302458	0
An Accurate UAV 3-D Path Planning Method for Disaster Emergency Response Based on an Improved Multiobjective Swarm Intelligence Algorithm	Planning a practical three-dimensional (3-D) flight path for unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) is a key challenge for the follow-up management and decision making in disaster emergency response. The ideal flight path is expected to balance the total flight path length and the terrain threat, to shorten the flight time and reduce the possibility of collision. However, in the traditional methods, the tradeoff between these concerns is difficult to achieve, and practical constraints are lacking in the optimized objective functions, which leads to inaccurate modeling. In addition, the traditional methods based on gradient optimization lack an accurate optimization capability in the complex multimodal objective space, resulting in a nonoptimal path. Thus, in this article, an accurate UAV 3-D path planning approach in accordance with an enhanced multiobjective swarm intelligence algorithm is proposed (APPMS). In the APPMS method, the path planning mission is converted into a multiobjective optimization task with multiple constraints, and the objectives based on the total flight path length and degree of terrain threat are simultaneously optimized. In addition, to obtain the optimal UAV 3-D flight path, an accurate swarm intelligence search approach based on improved ant colony optimization is introduced, which can improve the global and local search capabilities by using the preferred search direction and random neighborhood search mechanism. The effectiveness of the proposed APPMS method was demonstrated in three groups of simulated experiments with different degrees of terrain threat, and a real-data experiment with 3-D terrain data from an actual emergency situation.	https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9780258	0
Secure Long-Range Autonomous Valet Parking: A Reservation Scheme With Three-Factor Authentication and Key Agreement	Long-range autonomous valet parking (LAVP) is a current trend, partly due to traffic congestion and parking headache. For large-scale parking demands, reservation is introduced to effectively manage valet parking. However, existing schemes focus on parking request verification and parking check-in, which aren't applicable to LAVP because they ignore identity legitimacy and communication security in the phase of picking up as well as dropping off passengers. One viable solution is authentication and key agreement (AKA) protocol. Generally, due to low entropy of passwords and dictionary attacks, three-factor (i.e. passwords, biometrics, and smart card) AKA is more secure than single- and two-factor AKA. Unfortunately, known attacks and high overheads hinder the application of three-factor AKA in real-world environments. Hence, one of the most tough tasks is to balance security and availability, especially how to address the potential threats introduced by each factor while taking full advantage of three factors. Inspired by the above challenges, we propose a provably secure three-factor AKA protocol for reservation services in LAVP, namely SecLAVP. Specifically, the passenger and the autonomous vehicle ($AV$) complete mutual authentication with the assistance of drop-off/pick-up point ($DP$). After successful authentication, the session key is generated between the passenger, $DP$, and $AV$ for secure communication. In the Real-Or-Random (ROR) model, we formally prove SecLAVP satisfies session-key security. Then, we apply AVISPA to simulate our proposed protocol, to demonstrate that SecLAVP can resist man-in-the-middle attacks. Additionally, informal security analysis indicates that SecLAVP satisfies our defined 16 design goals concerning security. Finally, we evaluate performance of SecLAVP in terms of communication overheads, computational overheads, and scheduling, to manifest the feasibility.	https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9930623	0
An Optimal Layout Pattern-Based Solution Approach to the Extended Machine Layout Problem With Multirow Multicolumn Structure	The machine layout problem (MLP) is to determine the optimal location arrangement of machines in a production system, usually in order to minimize the total material transmission distance. This article considers a type of MLP in an automated manufacturing system with unequal-area machines, machine replicas, and taking multi-row multi-column layout structure. The aim is to determine the near-optimal machine layout and orbit layout simultaneously. We model the problem as a mixed-integer linear program by introducing the concept of orbit-based relative locations and using auxiliary binary variables, including relative location assignment variables, in-block relationship variables, and material routing variables. We further exploit the optimal layout patterns, based on which, when the relative locations of the machines and orbits are given, we can quickly derive the near-optimal absolute machine and orbit positions without solving a mixed-integer linear program. A two-layer hybrid heuristic method is proposed to solve the problem: the outer layer is a variable neighborhood search metaheuristic used to explore the solution space of the relative locations, while the inner layer is a recursive heuristic based on the optimal layout patterns. Experiments on instances of different sizes are conducted, and the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed algorithms are verified. Note to Practitioners—Many manufacturing systems, for example, those in the semiconductor industry, use automated guided vehicles running on orbits to transfer materials between machines. The design of such a manufacturing system consists of determining the numbers of vertical and horizontal orbits, their positions, and the positions of all machines. It is not unusual for there to be hundreds of machines. Furthermore, machines of the same type can be deployed non-adjacently in an automated transfer context since materials can easily be transmitted to an arbitrary machine. The flexibility and complexity of the layout make this layout problem extremely difficult to solve. To the best of our knowledge, no dedicated study has been conducted on this issue. Additionally, state-of-the-art methodologies for related machine layout problems cannot be extended to this problem, partly because one needs to consider the material routing problem explicitly on the orbit network. In this study, we reveal the optimal layout patterns given the relative locations of machines and orbits, and we develop a recursive heuristic that is thousands of times faster than solving the corresponding mixed-integer linear program. Our proposed two-layer hybrid heuristics can solve problems with hundreds of machines, while the inner-layer problem’s precision is guaranteed to within 1%. We believe our algorithm can be used for machine and orbit layout design in flexible manufacturing systems where machine-to-machine material shipment is enables in a rectangular trasmission network.	https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9796604	0
UAV-Assisted RSUs for V2X Connectivity Using Voronoi Diagrams in 6G+ Infrastructures	Sixth-generation networks and vehicular Ad hoc networks advancement brought us to the cusp of a new era. Autonomous Vehicles with a plethora of advanced applications require a substantially enhanced vehicle-to-everything communication network. The infrastructure should efficiently support hyper-fast, ultra-reliable, and low-latency massive data exchange. Roadside units were initially exploited as a promising communication solution to overcome this challenge. However, the challenging integration with the infrastructure led to the investigation of additional solutions. Unmanned aerial vehicles are one of the most dominant assistive solutions due to their inherent advantage of mobility. Moreover, air-to-air and ground-to-air networks are more efficient than ground-to-ground. Nevertheless, it is a prerequisite to leverage the potential of unmanned aerial vehicles to attain nationwide Vehicle-to-Everything connectivity. Therefore, we focused our research orientation on developing a strategy to optimize the network’s coverage within the intelligent transportation systems framework. In particular, we have deployed an innovative algorithmic technique that constructs Voronoi diagrams using circles. Besides, we applied the poison point process to determine the optimum locations of the transceivers’ establishment. Simulation results illustrate full network coverage for the tested area after the required iterations. Also, time complexity evaluation proved the simplicity of the proposed algorithm.	https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=10127579	0
Semantic-Aware Video Compression for Automotive Cameras	Assisted and automated driving functions in vehicles exploit sensor data to build situational awareness, however, the data amount required by these functions might exceed the bandwidth of current wired vehicle communication networks. Consequently, sensor data reduction, and automotive camera video compression need investigation. However, conventional video compression schemes, such as H.264 and H.265, have been mainly optimised for human vision. In this paper, we propose a semantic-aware (SA) video compression (SAC) framework that compresses separately and simultaneously region-of-interest and region-out-of-interest of automotive camera video frames, before transmitting them to processing unit(s), where the data are used for perception tasks, such as object detection, semantic segmentation, etc. Using our newly proposed technique, the region-of-interest (ROI), encapsulating most of the road stakeholders, retains higher quality using lower compression ratio. The experimental results show that under the same overall compression ratio, our proposed SAC scheme maintains a similar or better image quality, measured accordingly to traditional metrics and to our newly proposed semantic-aware metrics. The newly proposed metrics, namely SA-PSNR, SA-SSIM, and iIoU, give more emphasis to ROI quality, which has an immediate impact on the planning and decisions of assisted and automated driving functions. Using our SA-X264 compression, SA-PSNR and SA-SSIM have an increase of 2.864 and 0.008 respectively compared to traditional H.264, with higher ROI quality and the same compression ratio. Finally, a segmentation-based perception algorithm has been used to compare reconstructed frames, demonstrating a 2.7% mIOU improvement, when using the proposed SAC method versus traditional compression techniques.	https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=10103198	0
A Protocol for Reliable Real-Time Wireless Communication of Large Data Samples	In this article, we present a middleware protocol, that transmits larger-than-a-frame data samples within application real-time and reliability requirements over a lossy wireless channel. The protocol efficiently deploys an intelligent retransmission control that exploits the extended deadline requirements of a sample for frame-level scheduling. The transmission of such samples is placed in the context of the necessary integration of such external sensor data into the decision-making process of an autonomous vehicle. Therefore, we provide parameterization and access rules for communication links in resource-managed scenarios and lay out how to integrate the protocol into the popular DDS middleware. The performance of the parameterized links to satisfy their reliability requirements is studied and compared to error protection protocols in the current software stack. We base the evaluation on an OMNeT++ simulation, whereby an established wireless error model is used. The use case is placed in the context of collaborative sensing in a valet parking environment, where external infrastructure sensor data augments the autonomous vehicle's data processing chain via a lossy wireless link. Thereby, the use case adheres to the underlying safety requirements. Results show that if the protocol's awareness of the application requirements is used for parameterization, guarantees for reliability can be provided that outperform existing solutions.	https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=10123001	0
Secure Data Sharing With Flexible Cross-Domain Authorization in Autonomous Vehicle Systems	As an increasingly prevalent technology in intelligent autonomous transportation systems, autonomous vehicle platoon has been indicated the ability to significantly reduce fuel consumption as well as heighten highway safety and throughput. However, existing efforts rarely focus on protecting data confidentiality and authenticity in autonomous vehicle platoons. How to ensure secure and high-fidelity platoon-level communication is still in its infancy. This paper makes the first attempt for efficient and secure communication across autonomous vehicle platoons. Specifically, we present PDSM-FC, the first privacy-preserving data share mechanism with flexible cross-domain authorization over distinctive platoons. The key insight of PDSM-FC is the design of a new ciphertext conversion technique, which allows a ciphertext to be easily converted into another type of ciphertext, facilitating efficient access by all entities holding the legitimate authorization. As a result, PDSM-FC can achieve high-fidelity data communication between two unique platoons in ciphertext, so as to complete specific tasks including platoon integration. Rigorous security analysis shows that PDSM-FC is secure against various attacks such as collusion, forgery and chosen-plaintext attacks. Moreover, theoretical evaluation and extensive experiments demonstrate the practicability of PDSM-FC in terms of functionality, storage and computation overheads.	https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9737055	0
Advances in Line-of-Sight Guidance for Path Following of Autonomous Marine Vehicles: An Overview	Autonomous marine vehicles (AMVs), including autonomous surface and underwater vehicles, are versatile means to explore, exploit, monitor, and protect marine resources and environments. Motion control is a fundamental enabling technique for state-of-the-art AMV development. Especially, guidance is a critical component in AMV motion control. In recent years, line-of-sight (LOS) guidance, as an efficient guidance method, has attracted tremendous interest from both theoretical and practical perspectives. In this paper, an overview of recent advances in LOS guidance for AMV path following is provided. First, a control objective for the path following of an AMV with a kinematic model is specified. Next, major LOS guidance laws for path following are reviewed in detail. Then, LOS guidance laws applicable to coordinated path following of multiple AMVs are elaborated. Finally, six challenging issues for future research are addressed.	https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9750396	0
A Differential Fault Attack on Security Vehicle System Applied SIMON Block Cipher	With the application of new technologies in vehicles such as wireless communications, microelectronics, Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Autonomous Vehicles (AV), there are lots of embedded hardware and software in vehicles, and so cryptographic technologies such as block ciphers are also applied to the vehicle system to protect its security and privacy. In order to better find potential security vulnerabilities and improve security of the vehicle system which applied SIMON block cipher, in this paper, a novel Differential fault attack (DFA) method is presented. By inducing a random bit fault in  $L^{T-4}$  (the fourth round from the last), we first demonstrate the process of identifying the fault-induced position. Then, on the basis of the determined position, we describe how to retrieve three rounds of keys by inducing only one round of faults. For retrieving the SIMON family, compared with previous DFAs under the random bit fault model, the lowest numbers of fault-induced and fault locations (or rounds) are required by our attack. In particular, when the key words  $m$  is 2 or 3, the proposed attack only needs to induce one round of faults. Finally, we carry out simulation verification and a comparison to illustrate the correctness and effectiveness of the proposed attack.	https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9740036	0

Multitrajectory Model Predictive Control for Safe UAV Navigation in an Unknown Environment	The problem of navigating an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) in an unknown environment is addressed with a novel model predictive control (MPC) formulation, named multitrajectory MPC (mt-MPC). The objective is to safely drive the vehicle to the desired target location by relying only on the partial description of the surroundings provided by an exteroceptive sensor. This information results in time-varying constraints during the navigation among obstacles. The proposed mt-MPC generates a sequence of position set points that are fed to control loops at lower hierarchical levels. To do so, the mt-MPC predicts two different state trajectories, a safe one and an exploiting one, in the same finite horizon optimal control problem (FHOCP). This formulation, particularly suitable for problems with uncertain time-varying constraints, allows one to partially decouple constraint satisfaction (safety) from cost function minimization (exploitation). Uncertainty due to modeling errors and sensors noise is taken into account as well, in a set membership (SM) framework. Theoretical guarantees of persistent obstacle avoidance are derived under suitable assumptions, and the approach is demonstrated experimentally out-of-the-laboratory on a prototype built with off-the-shelf components.	https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9938397	0
Time-Driven and Privacy-Preserving Navigation Model for Vehicle-to-Vehicle Communication Systems	Effective time-driven navigation is an operative way to alleviate traffic congestion, which is also a challenging problem in the Internet of Vehicles context. Most existing centralized navigation systems often cannot react promptly to real-time local traffic situations, while most existing distributed navigation systems are vulnerable to privacy attacks. To overcome these drawbacks, we propose a learning model that provides a provable guarantee of vehicles' privacy while still enabling efficient navigation under real-time traffic conditions. The proposed model adopts a novel multi-agent system with customized differentially private mechanisms. To verify the effectiveness and stability of our approach, we implement the proposed method on CARLA, which is an autonomous driving simulator. In four experimental tasks with varying parameters, we demonstrate fully that our proposed method outperforms other benchmarks.	https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=10052728	0
Safety-Critical and Flexible Cooperative On-Ramp Merging Control of Connected and Automated Vehicles in Mixed Traffic	Cooperative on-ramp merging control for connected and automated vehicles (CAVs) can effectively improve traffic throughput and vehicle fuel efficiency at highway on-ramp merging bottlenecks. However, in the mixed traffic scenario where CAVs and human-driven vehicles (HDVs) coexist, the uncertain maneuvers of human drivers pose a major challenge to merging control in terms of safety and flexibility. To this end, this paper proposes a hierarchical cooperative on-ramp merging control strategy for CAVs to optimize flexible trajectories with safety guarantees in mixed traffic. First, the on-ramp merging control problem for CAVs is considered in the case of a three-vehicle coordination, resulting in an optimal control problem (OCP) coordinating on-ramp and main-lane CAVs for efficient operation while satisfying multiple safety-critical constraints. Second, a two-level hierarchical control architecture is developed to solve the OCP with mixed state-control constraints. The upper-level planner solves an unconstrained OCP with Pontryagin’s Minimum Principle to calculate an expected merging position, which is embedded in the variable time headway of safe merging constraints in the lower-level controller. Then, the controller converts the nonlinear OCP with safety-critical constraints to a quadratic programing (QP) problem by exploiting Control Barrier Functions (CBFs) and Control Lyapunov Functions (CLFs). By solving the QP efficiently, the time and energy efficient trajectory for each CAV is obtained. In addition, a receding horizon control framework is employed, which enables CAVs to determine flexible merging opportunity and tackle the disturbances caused by HDVs. Finally, comprehensive simulation results show that the proposed cooperative on-ramp merging strategy has potential in enabling merging flexibility, improving traffic efficiency and energy economy in real time.	https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=10053376	0
Handling Constrained Optimization in Factor Graphs for Autonomous Navigation	Factor graphs are graphical models used to represent a wide variety of problems across robotics, such as Structure from Motion (SfM), Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM) and calibration. Typically, at their core, they have an optimization problem whose terms only depend on a small subset of variables. Factor graph solvers exploit the locality of problems to drastically reduce the computational time of the Iterative Least-Squares (ILS) methodology. Although extremely powerful, their application is usually limited to unconstrained problems. In this letter, we model constraints over variables within factor graphs by introducing a factor graph version of the Augmented Lagrangian (AL) method. We show the potential of our method by presenting a full navigation stack based on factor graphs. Differently from standard navigation stacks, we can model both optimal control for local planning and localization with factor graphs, and solve the two problems using the standard ILS methodology. We validate our approach in real-world autonomous navigation scenarios, comparing it with the de facto standard navigation stack implemented in ROS. Comparative experiments show that for the application at hand our system outperforms the standard nonlinear programming solver Interior-Point Optimizer (IPOPT) in runtime, while achieving similar solutions.	https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9978644	0
Jamming and Eavesdropping Defense Scheme Based on Deep Reinforcement Learning in Autonomous Vehicle Networks	As a legacy from conventional wireless services, illegal eavesdropping is regarded as one of the critical security challenges in Connected and Autonomous Vehicles (CAVs) network. Our work considers the use of Distributed Kalman Filtering (DKF) and Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) techniques to improve anti-eavesdropping communication capacity and mitigate jamming interference. Aiming to improve the security performance against smart eavesdropper and jammer, we first develop a DKF algorithm that is capable of tracking the attacker more accurately by sharing state estimates among adjacent nodes. Then, a design problem for controlling transmission power and selecting communication channel is established while ensuring communication quality requirements of the authorized vehicular user. Since the eavesdropping and jamming model is uncertain and dynamic, a hierarchical Deep Q-Network (DQN)-based architecture is developed to design the anti-eavesdropping power control and possibly channel selection policy. Specifically, the optimal power control scheme without prior information of the eavesdropping behavior can be quickly achieved first. Based on the system secrecy rate assessment, the channel selection process is then performed when necessary. Simulation results confirm that our jamming and eavesdropping defense technique enhances the secrecy rate as well as achievable communication rate compared with currently available techniques.	https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=10016623	0
Anomaly Detection Against GPS Spoofing Attacks on Connected and Autonomous Vehicles Using Learning From Demonstration	GPS spoofing attacks pose great challenges to connected vehicle (CVs) safety applications and localization of autonomous vehicles (AVs). In this paper, we propose to utilize transportation and vehicle engineering domain knowledge to detect GPS spoofing attacks towards CVs and AVs. A novel detection method using learning from demonstration is developed, which can be implemented in both vehicles and at the transportation infrastructure. A computational-efficient driving model, which can be learned from historical trajectories of the vehicles, is constructed to predict normal driving behaviors. Then a statistical method is developed to measure the dissimilarities between the observed trajectory and the predicted normal trajectory for anomaly detection. We validate the proposed method using two threat models (i.e., attacks targeting the multi-sensor fusion system of AVs and attacks targeting the intersection movement assist application of CVs) on two real-world datasets (i.e., KAIST and Michigan roundabout dataset). Results show that the proposed model is able to detect almost all of the attacks in time with low false positive and false negative rates.	https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=10109166	0
Reinforcement Learning for Mobile Robotics Exploration: A Survey	Efficient exploration of unknown environments is a fundamental precondition for modern autonomous mobile robot applications.

Long-Term Localization Using Semantic Cues in Floor Plan Maps	Lifelong localization in a given map is an essential capability for autonomous service robots. In this letter, we consider the task of long-term localization in a changing indoor environment given sparse CAD floor plans. The commonly used pre-built maps from the robot sensors may increase the cost and time of deployment. Furthermore, their detailed nature requires that they are updated when significant changes occur. We address the difficulty of localization when the correspondence between the map and the observations is low due to the sparsity of the CAD map and the changing environment. To overcome both challenges, we propose to exploit semantic cues that are commonly present in human-oriented spaces. These semantic cues can be detected using RGB cameras by utilizing object detection, and are matched against an easy-to-update, abstract semantic map. The semantic information is integrated into a Monte Carlo localization framework using a particle filter that operates on 2D LiDAR scans and camera data. We provide a long-term localization solution and a semantic map format, for environments that undergo changes to their interior structure and detailed geometric maps are not available. We evaluate our localization framework on multiple challenging indoor scenarios in an office environment, taken weeks apart. The experiments suggest that our approach is robust to structural changes and can run on an onboard computer. We released the open source implementation of our approach written in C++ together with a ROS wrapper.	https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9956025	0
Data Freshness Optimization Under CAA in the UAV-Aided MECN: A Potential Game Perspective	As a promising enabler for edge intelligence, Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAV) have become more and more important in Mobile Edge Computing Networks (MECN), such as communication, computation, collection and control service supply. Although Age of Information (AoI) minimization is indispensable for fresh information collection and computation in the UAV-aided MECN, some attackers can launch attacks to deteriorate the availability of precious channel resources, such as revealed channel access attacks (CAAs). Moreover, recent research has not considered the system’s active probability and security issues concurrently, e.g., CAA, in the average AoI minimization process. In this paper, to deal with this problem, we consider an AoI-oriented channel access problem under CAA with a game theory viewpoint. Firstly, to obtain a MECN-based AoI indicator under CAA, the system model with active probability consideration is established. Next, the channel access-based AoI minimization problem is formulated from the viewpoint of the Ordinary Potential Game (OPG). Furthermore, two algorithms called AACSD and DCASD are proposed to determine channel access strategies, by which the Nash Equilibrium (NE) solution of the OPG could be reached. Finally, experiments are conducted under homogeneous and heterogeneous parameter settings, and the simulation results evaluate the correctness and effectiveness of our proposals.	https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9762890	0
GNSS Spoofer Localization for Vehicles Based on Doppler and Clock Drift Double Difference	With the development of vehicle navigation, autonomous driving and unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV), increasing spoofing attacks of global navigation satellite systems (GNSS) have emerged towards vehicles, which can mislead users by false position, velocity and time (PVT) solutions, resulting in serious consequences. Spoofer localization is a necessary step to fundamentally address the spoofing attacks. Most of the conventional spoofer localization methods are based on time of arrival (TOA) or time difference of arrival (TDOA), where time synchronization is indispensable and therefore is hard to apply to the existing vehicles equipped with independent commercial receivers. To cope with this problem, in this paper we develop a flexible method for vehicles to locate a stationary spoofer based on Doppler and clock drift double difference (DCDD). DCDD is calculated using Doppler measurements and clock drift solutions of one vehicular receiver and another reference receiver. Generally, Doppler frequency of GNSS signals changes slowly with time, which releases the restriction for high-precision time synchronization. DCDD represents the Doppler frequency caused by the vehicle motion, from which the spoofer position can be estimated. Utilizing DCDD, an iterative weighted least squares (WLS) algorithm is used to solve the spoofer position, and a closed-form initial value is given to improve the convergence rate. We evaluate the localization performance by the derived Cramér-Rao lower bound (CRLB) in the presence of vehicle position and velocity errors. Simulations and field vehicle experiments are conducted to verify the feasibility and effective of the proposed method.	https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9969943	0
Achieving Physical Layer Security Against Location Unknown Eavesdroppers via Friendly Jammer	Dear Editor, This letter is concerning friendly jamming unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) to assist in the safe communication of UAV base stations. Due to the openness of UAV wireless communication, it is vulnerable to attacks leading to information disclosure or blockage. To address this issue, friendly jamming UAVs can assist UAV base stations and improve the security of wireless communications. This letter introduces a dual UAV system that consists of a source UAV (S-UAV) and a friendly jamming UAV (J-UAV). We construct an optimization problem to maximize the security region under physical constraints, which is non-convex and complicated. Security region (SR) is proposed for assessing the security performance of the whole system. Numerical simulations show that the hazard level of unknown eavesdroppers is attenuated after trajectory and power optimization.	https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=10251059	0
Hawk-Pigeon Game Tactics for Unmanned Aerial Vehicle Swarm Target Defense	Unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) swarm target defense is a crucial and practical issue about group decision-making and cooperative control in multiagent systems. Hawk-pigeon game architecture is presented in this article to guide UAV swarm target defense. Firstly, a 6-degree-of-freedom UAV model is employed, and the control command converter is derived, which could be widely used in the transformation from the second-order integrator model to the 6-DOF UAV model. Moreover, the attack tactics and pursuit strategies of the defender UAVs are proposed inspired by the hawk's hunting mechanism, and the dynamic model of the attacker UAVs is formulated inspired by pigeon group homing behavior. Furthermore, the victory zone of the hawk-pigeon game is analyzed using the time of interception and explicitly exhibited in isochrones means. The proposed method is scalable and adaptive, adopting distributed decision-making to support large-scale UAV swarm engagement. Finally, comparative experiments in different scenarios demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method over state-of-the-art target-attacker-defender game methods on the win rate, the number of captures, and activity time.	https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=10050779	0
End-to-End Autonomous Driving With Semantic Depth Cloud Mapping and Multi-Agent	Focusing on the task of point-to-point navigation for an autonomous driving vehicle, we propose a novel deep learning model trained with end-to-end and multi-task learning manners to perform both perception and control tasks simultaneously. The model is used to drive the ego vehicle safely by following a sequence of routes defined by the global planner. The perception part of the model is used to encode high-dimensional observation data provided by an RGBD camera while performing semantic segmentation, semantic depth cloud (SDC) mapping, and traffic light state and stop sign prediction. Then, the control part decodes the encoded features along with additional information provided by GPS and speedometer to predict waypoints that come with a latent feature space. Furthermore, two agents are employed to process these outputs and make a control policy that determines the level of steering, throttle, and brake as the final action. The model is evaluated on CARLA simulator with various scenarios made of normal-adversarial situations and different weathers to mimic real-world conditions. In addition, we do a comparative study with some recent models to justify the performance in multiple aspects of driving. Moreover, we also conduct an ablation study on SDC mapping and multi-agent to understand their roles and behavior. As a result, our model achieves the highest driving score even with fewer parameters and computation load. To support future studies, we share our codes at https://github.com/oskarnatan/end-to-end-driving.	https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9802907	0
Road Shape Classification-Based Matching Between Lane Detection and HD Map for Robust Localization of Autonomous Cars	Many map matching-based localization algorithms estimate the autonomous car's pose using a registration between lanes measured by a camera and the High-Definition (HD) map. However, the registration methods based on numerical optimization, such as the Iterative Closest Point (ICP) and Normal Distributions Transform (NDT), can cause underdetermined problems due to no unique solution when matching under-constrained lane shapes such as straight lines and circular arcs. This paper proposes a robust localization algorithm with centimeter-level accuracy by applying different matching techniques depending on the road shape. We proposed a road shape classification-based map matching algorithm to overcome the under-constrained problems, which have no unique solution due to insufficient constraints. The proposed algorithm classifies lane segments into line, arc, and clothoid curves considering their curvature characteristics. After that, we find correction information through a map matching and covariance estimation method using lane pairs with the same type of their shape. For the under-constrained shapes, the geometry-based map-matching algorithm and covariance estimation method are applied to avoid underdetermined results. Finally, the measurement calculated from the correction information and predicted pose of the ego-vehicle is exploited for the measurement update of the Extended Kalman Filter (EKF). The proposed method was quantitatively evaluated in the simulation environment, which contains various road shapes, and qualitatively validated for experimental data from an autonomous driving platform. The proposed algorithm shows more robust matching capability, efficient computation time, and higher accuracy than the localization system based on ICP-based lane matching.	https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9940999	0
An Analytical Latency Model and Evaluation of the Capacity of 5G NR to Support V2X Services Using V2N2V Communications	5G has been designed to support applications such as connected and automated driving. To this aim, 5G includes a highly flexible New Radio (NR) interface that can be configured to utilize different subcarrier spacings (SCS), slot durations, scheduling, and retransmissions mechanisms. This flexibility can be exploited to support advanced V2X services with strict latency and reliability requirements using V2N2V (Vehicle-to-Network-to-Vehicles) communications instead of direct or sidelink V2V (Vehicle-to-Vehicle). To analyze this possibility, this paper presents a novel analytical model that estimates the latency of 5G at the radio network level. The model accounts for the use of different numerologies (SCS, slot durations and Cyclic Prefixes), modulation and coding schemes, full-slots or mini-slots, semi-static and dynamic scheduling, different retransmission mechanisms, and broadcast/multicast or unicast transmissions. The model has been used to first analyze the impact of different 5G NR radio configurations on the latency. We then identify which radio configurations and scenarios can 5G NR satisfy the latency and reliability requirements of V2X services using V2N2V communications. This paper considers cooperative lane changes as a case study. The results show that 5G can support advanced V2X services at the radio network level using V2N2V communications under certain conditions that depend on the radio configuration, bandwidth, service requirements and cell traffic load.	https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9897006	0
Autonomous Vehicles Security: Challenges and Solutions Using Blockchain and Artificial Intelligence	The arrival of autonomous vehicles (AVs) promises many great benefits, including increased safety and reduced energy consumption, pollution, and congestion. However, these engines have many security and privacy issues that could undermine the expected benefits if not addressed. AVs will provide new opportunities for hackers to carry out malicious attacks, posing a great threat to the future of mobility and data protection. The research trend in this field indicates that combining Blockchain and AI could bring strong protection for AVs against malicious attacks. Blockchain and AI have different working paradigms, but when merged, they can empower each other, and solve many security and privacy issues of AVs. AI can optimise the construction of the Blockchain to make it more efficient, secure and energy-saving, where Blockchain provides data immutability and trust mechanism for AI-based solutions and makes them more transparent, trustful, and explainable. Although some research is being conducted on this area, the topic of applying Blockchain and AI for securing AVs is not deeply investigated. In this paper, we explore the possible application of an amalgamation of Blockchain and AI solutions for securing AVs. We first introduce a classification of security and privacy threats that may arise from the application of AVs. Then, we provide an overview of recent literature regarding Blockchain and AI usage for securing AVs. Finally, we highlight limitations and challenges that may face the integration of Blockchain and AI with AVs based on our systemic review and suggest potential future directions for research in this field.	https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=10023964	0
A Systematic Survey: Security Threats to UAV-Aided IoT Applications, Taxonomy, Current Challenges and Requirements With Future Research Directions	Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) as an intermediary can offer an efficient and useful communication paradigm for different Internet of Things (IoT) applications. Following the operational capabilities of IoTs, this emerging technology could be extremely helpful in the area, where human access is not possible. Because IoT devices are employed in an infrastructure-less environment, where they communicate with each other via the wireless medium to share accumulated data in network topological order. However, the unstructured deployment with wireless and dynamic communication make them disclosed to various security threats, which need to be addressed for their efficient results. Therefore, the primary objective of this work is to present a comprehensive survey of the theoretical literature associated with security concerns of this emerging technology from 2015-to-2022.

By doing this, we set a preface for the answer to a question, why this paper is needed in the presence of published review articles. For novelty and uniqueness, we have performed a comparative analysis section-wise with rival papers to demonstrate that how this paper is different from them.	https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9946859	0
The OpenCDA Open-Source Ecosystem for Cooperative Driving Automation Research	Advances in Single-vehicle intelligence of automated driving has encountered great challenges because of limited capabilities in perception and interaction with complex traffic environments. Cooperative Driving Automation (CDA) has been considered a pivotal solution to next-generation automated driving and smart transportation. Though CDA has attracted much attention from both academia and industry, exploration of its potential is still in its infancy. In industry, companies tend to build their in-house data collection pipeline and research tools to tailor their needs and protect intellectual properties. Reinventing the wheels, however, wastes resources and limits the generalizability of the developed approaches since no standardized benchmarks exist. On the other hand, in academia, due to the absence of real-world traffic data and computation resources, researchers often investigate CDA topics in simplified and mostly simulated environments, restricting the possibility of scaling the research outputs to real-world scenarios. Therefore, there is an urgent need to establish an open-source ecosystem (OSE) to address the demands of different communities for CDA research, particularly in the early exploratory research stages, and provide the bridge to ensure an integrated development and testing pipeline that diverse communities can share. In this paper, we introduce the OpenCDA research ecosystem, a unified OSE integrated with a model zoo, a suite of driving simulators at various resolutions, large-scale real-world and simulated datasets, complete development toolkits for benchmark training/testing, and a scenario database/generator. We also demonstrate the effectiveness of OpenCDA OSE through example use cases, including cooperative 3D LiDAR detection, cooperative merge, cooperative camera-based map prediction, and adversarial scenario generation.	https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=10045043	0
Fuzzy-Model-Based Lateral Control for Networked Autonomous Vehicle Systems Under Hybrid Cyber-Attacks	This article addresses the problem of lateral control problem for networked-based autonomous vehicle systems. A novel solution is presented for nonlinear autonomous vehicles to smoothly follow the planned path under external disturbances and network-induced issues, such as cyber-attacks, time delays, and limited bandwidths. First, a fuzzy-model-based system is established to represent the nonlinear networked vehicle systems subject to hybrid cyber-attacks. To reduce the network burden and effects of cyber-attacks, an asynchronous resilient event-triggered scheme (ETS) is proposed. A dynamic output-feedback control method is developed to address the underlying problem. Conditions are derived to obtain the output-feedback controller and resilient asynchronous ETS such that the closed-loop switched fuzzy system is globally exponentially stable. Examples are provided to demonstrate the effectiveness and merits of the proposed new control design techniques.	https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9733964	0
Robust Decision Making for Autonomous Vehicles at Highway On-Ramps: A Constrained Adversarial Reinforcement Learning Approach	Reinforcement learning has demonstrated its potential in a series of challenging domains. However, many real-world decision making tasks involve unpredictable environmental changes or unavoidable perception errors that are often enough to mislead an agent into making suboptimal decisions and even cause catastrophic failures. In light of these potential risks, reinforcement learning with application in safety-critical autonomous driving domain remains tricky without ensuring robustness against environmental uncertainties (e.g., road adhesion changes or measurement noises). Therefore, this paper proposes a novel constrained adversarial reinforcement learning approach for robust decision making of autonomous vehicles at highway on-ramps. Environmental disturbance is modelled as an adversarial agent that can learn an optimal adversarial policy to thwart the autonomous driving agent. Meanwhile, observation perturbation is approximated to maximize the variation of the perturbed policy through a white-box adversarial attack technique. Furthermore, a constrained adversarial actor-critic algorithm is presented to optimize an on-ramp merging policy while keeping the variations of the attacked driving policy and action-value function within bounds. Finally, the proposed robust highway on-ramp merging decision making method of autonomous vehicles is evaluated in three stochastic mixed traffic flows with different densities, and its effectiveness is demonstrated in comparison with the competitive baselines.	https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9994638	0
6G Connected Vehicle Framework to Support Intelligent Road Maintenance Using Deep Learning Data Fusion	The growth of IoT, edge and mobile Artificial Intelligence (AI) is supporting urban authorities exploit the wealth of information collected by Connected and Autonomous Vehicles (CAV), to drive the development of transformative intelligent transport applications for addressing smart city challenges. A critical challenge is timely and efficient road infrastructure maintenance. This paper proposes an intelligent hierarchical framework for road infrastructure maintenance that exploits the latest developments in 6G communication technologies, deep learning techniques, and mobile edge AI training approaches. The proposed framework abides with the stringent requirements of training efficient machine learning applications for CAV, and is able to exploit the vast numbers of CAVs forecasted to be present on future road networks. At the core of our framework is a novel Convolution Neural Networks (CNN) model which fuses imagery and sensory data to perform pothole detection. Experiments show the proposed model can achieve state of the art performance in comparison to existing approaches while being simple, cost-effective and computationally efficient to deploy. The proposed system can form part of a federated learning framework for facilitating large scale real-time road surface condition monitoring and support adaptive resource allocation for road infrastructure maintenance.	https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=10021225	0
Exploiting Multi-Modal Fusion for Urban Autonomous Driving Using Latent Deep Reinforcement Learning	Human driving decisions are the leading cause of road fatalities. Autonomous driving naturally eliminates such incompetent decisions and thus can improve traffic safety and efficiency. Deep reinforcement learning (DRL) has shown great potential in learning complex tasks. Recently, researchers investigated various DRL-based approaches for autonomous driving. However, exploiting multi-modal fusion to generate perception and motion prediction and then leveraging these predictions to train a latent DRL has not been targeted yet. To that end, we propose enhancing urban autonomous driving using multi-modal fusion with latent DRL. A single LIDAR sensor is used to extract bird's-eye view (BEV), range view (RV), and residual input images. These images are passed into LiCaNext, a real-time multi-modal fusion network, to produce accurate joint perception and motion prediction. Next, predictions are fed with another simple BEV image into the latent DRL to learn a complex end-to-end driving policy ensuring safety, efficiency, and comfort. A sequential latent model is deployed to learn more compact representations from inputs, leading to improved sampling efficiency for reinforcement learning. Our experiments are simulated on CARLA and evaluated against state-of-the-art DRL models. Results manifest that our method learns a better driving policy that outperforms other prevailing models. Further experiments are conducted to reveal the effectiveness of our proposed approach under different environments and varying weather conditions.	https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9934803	0
HOOPOE: High Performance and Efficient Anonymous Handover Authentication Protocol for Flying Out of Zone UAVs	The unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) in military and civilian systems access sensitive data via cellular networks and are ubiquitous. Therefore, the number of handovers may increase, and the process of sharing authentication keys between drones to new drones may be vulnerable to eavesdropping due to the wireless connectivity. For example, a UAV initially served by cell A may be handed over to cell B after a certain point. Therefore, Security and privacy concerns raise if there is a change in the flight path of the UAV due to wide-area connectivity traffic management, including authentication threats as well as the leakage of identity, location, and flying routes. Also, drones are resource-constrained devices that cannot perform extensive operations, leading to the inability to resist drone capture attacks and impersonation attacks. Therefore, this paper presents a high-performance and efficient anonymous handover authentication protocol to secure the drone traveling path. The protocol utilizes the advantages of the AES-RSA algorithm to provide efficient and secure key management and a fast verification and signature generation that speeds up drone authentication. The protocol's security was proved using the formal verification ROR model and automated security verifier ProVerif tool to validate the protocol resistance against various attacks and provided forward secrecy. In addition, the performance of the proposed protocol is evaluated using the OMNeT++ simulator in terms of communication, computation cost, energy consumption, packet drop ratio, end-to-end delay, and throughput. The results showed that the protocol achieves better security, efficiency, and performance than other protocols.	https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=10082875	0
UAS-Borne Radar for Autonomous Navigation and Surveillance Applications	The autonomous navigation of UAS requires, among others, detect-and-avoid capability as a prerequisite for enabling wide-ranging applications, including the transportation of goods and people. This article presents the design, implementation, and experimental results of a UAS-borne radar system detecting drones. The applications of the proposed system include not only detect-and-avoid systems for safe and autonomous navigation of unmanned aircraft systems but also airborne surveillance of malicious drones in controlled or restricted airspace for mitigating security and privacy threats. The system performance in terms of maximum detection range is evaluated through field tests. The experimental results show that the proposed UAS-borne radar can detect a DJI Phantom 4 and a DJI Matrice 600 Pro at a maximum distance of 440 and 500 meters, respectively. The article also provides insights into the system implementation and integration aspects, discusses future research direction, and stresses the need for standardization efforts to benchmark the required performance levels for UAS-borne radars.	https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=10075053	0
Resilient and Safe Platooning Control of Connected Automated Vehicles Against Intermittent Denial-of-Service Attacks	Connected automated vehicles (CAVs) serve as a promising enabler for future intelligent transportation systems because of their capabilities in improving traffic efficiency and driving safety, and reducing fuel consumption and vehicle emissions. A fundamental issue in CAVs is platooning control that empowers a convoy of CAVs to be cooperatively maneuvered with desired longitudinal spacings and identical velocities on roads. This paper addresses the issue of resilient and safe platooning control of CAVs subject to intermittent denial-of-service (DoS) attacks that disrupt vehicle-to-vehicle communications. First, a heterogeneous and uncertain vehicle longitudinal dynamic model is presented to accommodate a variety of uncertainties, including diverse vehicle masses and engine inertial delays, unknown and nonlinear resistance forces, and a dynamic platoon leader. Then, a resilient and safe distributed longitudinal platooning control law is constructed with an aim to preserve simultaneous individual vehicle stability, attack resilience, platoon safety and scalability. Furthermore, a numerically efficient offline design algorithm for determining the desired platoon control law is developed, under which the platoon resilience against DoS attacks can be maximized but the anticipated stability, safety and scalability requirements remain preserved. Finally, extensive numerical experiments are provided to substantiate the efficacy of the proposed platooning method.	https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9878288	0
AdvDDoS: Zero-Query Adversarial Attacks Against Commercial Speech Recognition Systems	Automatic speech recognition (ASR) has been widely and commercially employed in health care, autonomous vehicles, and finance. Yet, recent studies have shown that universal adversarial perturbations (UAPs) pose a serious threat to white-box ASR systems when the adversary has access to the target model. Until now, the impacts of such a threat on commercial systems are still open since their models are not publicly available. To understand the security weakness in the practical black-box setting, this paper introduces the first zero-query UAP attacks, called AdvDDoS, with black-box access to ASR systems: we do not need to pay any query expense to estimate UAPs. Specifically, we craft targeted UAPs under a popular feature extractor and a local ASR model by reversing the robust target-category features, in which adversarial perturbations containing robust features are believed to have better transferability. Compared with vanilla UAPs, our UAPs incorporated with target-category features lead to better attacks against commercial ASR systems. We validate the efficacy of our AdvDDoS by launching attacks against a range of commercial ASR systems, i.e., three API services (Alibaba, Tencent, and Baidu), and three personal assistants (Apple Siri, iFlytek, and Google). Extensive experimental results demonstrate the superiority of AdvDDoS. For example, AdvDDoS achieves 83.26% word error rate (WER) and 53.25% success rates of attacks (SRoA) for the universal attack against Tencent ASR API, which outperforms the vanilla UAPs by up to 61.56% on WER and 11.6% on SRoA. The success of our attack sheds light on zero-query UAP attacks against commercial ASR systems.	https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=10145466	0
UAV penetration mission path planning based on improved holonic particle swarm optimization	To meet the requirements of safety, concealment, and timeliness of trajectory planning during the unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) penetration process, a three-dimensional path planning algorithm is proposed based on improved holonic particle swarm optimization (IHPSO). Firstly, the requirements of terrain threat, radar detection, and penetration time in the process of UAV penetration are quantified. Regarding radar threats, a radar echo analysis method based on radar cross section (RCS) and the spatial situation is proposed to quantify the concealment of UAV penetration. Then the structure-particle swarm optimization (PSO) algorithm is improved from three aspects. First, the conversion ability of the search strategy is enhanced by using the system clustering method and the information entropy grouping strategy instead of random grouping and constructing the state switching conditions based on the fitness function. Second, the unclear setting of iteration numbers is addressed by using particle spacing to create the termination condition of the algorithm. Finally, the trajectory is optimized to meet the intended requirements by building a predictive control model and using the IHPSO for simulation verification. Numerical examples show the superiority of the proposed method over the existing PSO methods.	https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=10005043	0
In-Vehicle CAN Bus Tampering Attacks Detection for Connected and Autonomous Vehicles Using an Improved Isolation Forest Method	The development and applications of mobile communication technologies in intelligent autonomous transportation systems have led to an extraordinary rise in the mount of connected and autonomous vehicles (CAVs). Ensuring the security of in-vehicle communication data is the basis for the safety of cooperative transportation systems. An in-vehicle controller area network (CAN) bus is an important issue in in-vehicle security, and some hackers have mastered remote vehicle control methods through the CAN bus network. This paper proposes an improved isolation forest method with data mass (MS-iForest) for data tampering attack detection, in which we use data mass instead of the number of divisions and give an anomaly score ranking to quantify the degree of anomalies. This method is promising to be used as part of the intrusion detection system, like a security component in the onboard gateway, which can effectively avoid the data tampering attacks. We compare the proposed method with other anomaly detection schemes based on the data collected from an in-vehicle simulated dataset and two standard datasets. The experiment results show that the proposed method performs better than the other anomaly detection schemes in terms of the area under the receiver operating curve (AUC).	https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9652038	0
Resilient Event-Triggered Control of Connected Automated Vehicles Under Cyber Attacks	Dear Editor, This letter contributes to designing a resilient event-triggered controller for connected automated vehicles under cyber attacks, including denial-of-service (DoS) and deception attacks. To characterize the effect of DoS attacks, the effective intervals of the attack are redivided based on the sampling period. Then, a resilient distributed event-triggering mechanism is proposed to compensate for the sabotage of DoS attacks and reduce the amount of transmitted data. Since the communication channel transmits the data only at the trigger instant, deception attacks may occur at this instant and be transmitted to each vehicle in superposition with the normal signal. Therefore, we construct stochastic models satisfying Bernoulli distribution to describe the false information injected by the attackers. Based on the above framework, an attack-resilient control strategy is proposed to resist the impact of cyber attacks. Then, sufficient conditions are established to achieve stability of vehicular platoons, and a co-design strategy regarding the control gain and triggering parameter matrices is given. Finally, the simulation results are provided to substantiate the effectiveness of the proposed method.	https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=10084420	0
A Defensive Strategy Against Beam Training Attack in 5G mmWave Networks for Manufacturing	Millimeter-wave (mmWave) carriers are an essential building block of fifth-generation (5G) systems. Satisfactory performance of the communications over the mmWave spectrum requires an alignment between the signal beam of the transmitter and receiver, achieved via beam training protocols. Nevertheless, beam training is vulnerable to jamming attacks, where the attacker intends to send jamming signals over different spatial directions to confuse legitimate nodes. This paper focuses on defending against this attack in smart factories where a moving Automated Guided Vehicle (AGV) communicates with a base station via a mmWave carrier. We introduce a defensive strategy to cope with jamming attacks, including two stages: jamming detection and jamming mitigation. Developed based on autoencoders, both algorithms can learn the characteristics/features of the received signals at the AGV. They can be employed consecutively before performing the downlink data transmission. In particular, once a jamming attack is identified, the jamming mitigation can be utilized to retrieve the corrupted received signal strength vector, allowing a better decision during the beam training operation. In addition, the proposed algorithm is straightforward and fully compliant with the existing beam training protocols in 5G New Radio. The numerical results show that not only the proposed defensive strategy can capture more than 80% of attack events, but it also improves the average signal-to-interference-plus-noise-ratio significantly, i.e., up to 15 dB.	https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=10093907	0
Dynamic Reallocation Model of Multiple Unmanned Aerial Vehicle Tasks in Emergent Adjustment Scenarios	Due to their strong risk tolerance, low manufacturing cost, and good maneuverability, unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) have been widely used in various fields. Among related challenges, coordinated task assignment is a key scientific issue for autonomous control of UAVs. In this article, based on the idea of fuzzy C-means clustering and the ant colony optimization algorithm, a cooperative multiple task reallocation problem with target precedence constraints for heterogeneous UAVs is proposed. The contributions of this research are the performance evaluation of the original algorithms in a dynamic context, consideration of changes in some attributes of the environment, and the extension of these algorithms to properly address more realistic dynamic emergent adjustment scenarios. According to the corresponding task reallocation strategy, the scenarios are divided into three categories: the complete redistribution strategy can effectively cope with scenarios where tasks have changed significantly, the partial adjustment strategy can induce partial responses to the changes of individual tasks, and group redistribution can effectively solve the problem of task target threat rating changes. The simulation results show that the dynamic reallocation model of multi-UAV tasks in dynamic emergent adjustment scenarios can achieve better performance to complete the corresponding tasks based on the proposed scheme. In addition, we deployed the developed graphical modeling and analysis software platform to implement the dynamic reallocation model of multi-UAV tasks in dynamic emergent scenarios, and the validity and reliability of the proposed task reallocation model were verified.	https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9847033	0
A Survey on Joint-Operation Application for Unmanned Swarm Formations Under a Complex Confrontation Environment	With the rapid development of informatization, autonomy and intelligence, unmanned swarm formation intelligent operations will become the main combat mode of future wars. Typical unmanned swarm formations such as ground-based directed energy weapon formations, space-based kinetic energy weapon formations, and sea-based carrier-based formations have become the trump card for winning future wars. In a complex confrontation environment, these sophisticated weapon formation systems can precisely strike mobile threat group targets, making them extreme deterrents in joint combat applications. Based on this, first, this paper provides a comprehensive summary of the outstanding advantages, strategic position and combat style of unmanned clusters in joint warfare to highlight their important position in future warfare. Second, a detailed analysis of the technological breakthroughs in four key areas, situational awareness, heterogeneous coordination, mixed combat, and intelligent assessment of typical unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) swarms in joint warfare, is presented. An in-depth analysis of the UAV swarm communication networking operating mechanism during joint warfare is provided to lay the theoretical foundation for subsequent cooperative tracking and control. Then, an in-depth analysis of the shut-in technology requirements of UAV clusters in joint warfare is provided to lay a theoretical foundation for subsequent cooperative tracking control. Finally, the technical requirements of UAV clusters in joint warfare are analysed in depth so the key technologies can form a closed-loop kill chain system and provide theoretical references for the study of intelligent command operations.	https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=10403831	0
Multi-Modal Sensor Fusion and Object Tracking for Autonomous Racing	Reliable detection and tracking of surrounding objects are indispensable for comprehensive motion prediction and planning of autonomous vehicles. Due to the limitations of individual sensors, the fusion of multiple sensor modalities is required to improve the overall detection capabilities. Additionally, robust motion tracking is essential for reducing the effect of sensor noise and improving state estimation accuracy. The reliability of the autonomous vehicle software becomes even more relevant in complex, adversarial high-speed scenarios at the vehicle handling limits in autonomous racing. In this paper, we present a modular multi-modal sensor fusion and tracking method for high-speed applications. The method is based on the Extended Kalman Filter (EKF) and is capable of fusing heterogeneous detection inputs to track surrounding objects consistently. A novel delay compensation approach enables to reduce the influence of the perception software latency and to output an updated object list. It is the first fusion and tracking method validated in high-speed real-world scenarios at the Indy Autonomous Challenge 2021 and the Autonomous Challenge at CES (AC@CES) 2022, proving its robustness and computational efficiency on embedded systems. It does not require any labeled data and achieves position tracking residuals below 0.1 m.	https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=10113239	0
Multi-Stage RF Emitter Search and Geolocation With UAV: A Cognitive Learning-Based Method	This paper investigates the issue of searching and geolocating a radio frequency (RF) emitter with an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) in a rich scattering environment. The absence of knowledge of the characteristics of the target RF signals, the ground-to-air channels, and the potential geographical distribution of the RF emitter makes efficient trajectory planning (TP) and geolocating intractable. Since the average signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of the signal captured by the UAV changes across the search area, state-of-the-art TP is inapplicable due to the assumption of a single problem domain, according to the No Free Lunch (NFL) theorem. In contrast, we develop a cognitive multi-stage search and geolocation (CMSG) framework, which adjusts the adopted TP algorithms in various search stages. In the stage with extremely-low SNRs, a random-walk-based TP is proposed to avoid meaningless detours. For stages with higher SNRs, the TP follows policies optimized by a novel search method based on direction of arrival (DOA) estimation and reinforcement learning. To alleviate the impairment of unreliable DOA estimations, empirical emitter position estimations are exploited to find the best flight directions. Simulation results confirm the advantages of the proposed CMSG over various baselines in lowering both failure rate and time consumption.	https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=10016683	0
The Effect of Vehicle Automation Styles on Drivers’ Emotional State	Self-driving vehicles promise many safety, mobility, and environmental benefits. However, users’ lack of trust and acceptance may threaten the success and potential of this technology. Monitoring the driver’s emotional state is one way to address this challenge. Empathetic automation can respond to the driver’s state and improve the experience and acceptance of self-driving vehicle drivers. In this study, 24 participants rode in a self-driving vehicle simulator and experienced three automation styles (aggressive, moderate, conservative) and four intersection types (with and without a stop sign, and with and without traffic.) We identified the observed drivers’ emotions from the video data and labeled the video frames using the dimensional and discrete emotion models to examine how automation behavior affects the driver’s emotional state. We used multilevel Bayesian linear regression and multilevel Dirichlet regression to model the continuous and discrete emotions, respectively. The automation driving style effect varied for each participant. The same conditions provoked positive responses for some participants, and negative for others. Furthermore, the results showed that intersection type, the position within the intersection, and their interaction affected the driver’s emotional state. This indicates that personalized driver state monitoring systems might enhance drivers’ experience in self-driving vehicles.	https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=10038623	0
Interference Analysis for UAV Radar Networks With Guard Zones Based on Stochastic Geometry	Due to the increasing number of aerial radars and joint communication/sensing technologies, interference from uncoordinated radars will limit the target detection and ranging performance in the future. In this article, we investigate the interference behavior in an aerial radar network for sensing ground targets. We consider that the radars mounted on unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) that fly at a certain altitude are randomly distributed according to a two-dimensional homogeneous Poisson point process (HPPP), and that the propagation is modeled using a probabilistic line-of-sight channel model. For such a sensing network, we derive the distribution of the radar interference using a stochastic geometry based analysis. In particular, when Swerling I model is considered for radar cross-section area for the target, we derive the Laplace transform of the radar interference. To avoid a strong interference between neighboring radars, a guard zone is introduced within which the UAV radar transmission around the permitted active radar is inhibited. As the radar performance metric, we derive the successful ranging probability (SRP) of a given radar by exploiting the Laplace transform of radar interference. Using the analytic SRP, we show that we can optimize the radar network parameters such as the radius of the guard zone and the density of the active radars. In addition, we also discuss how the analytic SRP gives an insight into the spectrum utilization strategy for the UAV radar networks with the guard zones.	https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=10015586	0
UAV Tracking Based on Correlation Filters With Dynamic Aberrance-Repressed Temporal Regularizations	As a significant research direction in remote sensing fields, unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) tracking has achieved rapid development in recent years. However, due to limited power and computation resources on aerial platforms, the tracking methods deployed on UAVs usually require high computational efficiency and performance. In addition, various challenges (i.e., similar object, background clutter, and occlusion) have inevitably occurred during the UAV tracking phase. Therefore, considering the above issues comprehensively, this article proposes a dynamic aberrance-repressed temporal regularized correlation filter (CF) to achieve stable tracking in UAV remote sensing videos. First, we have introduced the aberrance-repressed temporal regularizations into the discriminative CF framework. Second, a novel objective loss function is constructed to adjust the strength of each regularization for training the filter. Then, a new judgment mechanism based on the response variation is exploited to reflect the response fluctuation and applied to tune parameters of both regularizations. Finally, comprehensive experiments are done on three different UAV benchmarks, i.e., UAV123@10fps, UAVDT, and VisDrone2018, to verify the performance of our tracker and have demonstrated that our tracker achieves superior performance against other total 25 state-of-the-art trackers while reaching $\sim$35 FPS on a single CPU.	https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=10223259	0
UAV-Assisted Wireless Backhaul Networks: Connectivity Analysis of Uplink Transmissions	With the proliferation of wireless communication technologies, user equipments (UEs) in rural or disaster areas have data-transmission demand to upload their data to the core network. However, current networks lack coverage in rural or disaster areas due to the absence or damage of/to infrastructures. To address this issue, a promising solution is employing unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) as relays to assist the wireless backhaul of UEs to remote ground base stations (GBSs). For convenience, we call these networks as UAV-assisted wireless backhaul networks (UABNs). This paper aims to investigate the uplink transmission performance in UABNs. In particular, we analyze the connectivity of the two-hop uplink path from a reference UE to a remote GBS via a reference UAV. Compared with previous studies that mostly analyze single-hop transmissions, the investigation of the path connectivity of UABNs is more complex because of the location variation of UAVs as well as the complexity of the interference at the two-hop path. Considering the distribution of UEs, we exploit stochastic geometry to establish a theoretical model to analyze the path connectivity of UABNs. In our model, UEs form clusters according to a Poisson Cluster Process (PCP) and one UAV serves one UE cluster. Based on our model, the connectivity of a two-hop uplink path is finally derived by limiting the signal-to-noise-plus-interference (SINR) above a threshold. Theoretical values of the connectivity of UABNs match with simulation results, confirming the accuracy of the proposed analytical model. Our results also offer insightful implications for constructing and configuring UABNs.	https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=10104142	0
Boosting UAV Tracking With Voxel-Based Trajectory-Aware Pre-Training	Siamese network-based object tracking has remarkably promoted the automatic capability for highly-maneuvered unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs). However, the leading-edge tracking framework often depends on template matching, making it trapped when facing multiple views of object in consecutive frames. Moreover, the general image-level pretrained backbone can overfit to holistic representations, causing the misalignment to learn object-level properties in UAV tracking. To tackle these issues, this work presents TRTrack, a comprehensive framework to fully exploit the stereoscopic representation for UAV tracking. Specifically, a novel pre-training paradigm method is proposed. Through trajectory-aware reconstruction training (TRT), the capability of the backbone to extract stereoscopic structure feature is strengthened without any parameter increment. Accordingly, an innovative hierarchical self-attention Transformer is proposed to capture the local detail information and global structure knowledge. For optimizing the correlation map, we proposed a novel spatial correlation refinement (SCR) module, which promotes the capability of modeling the long-range spatial dependencies. Comprehensive experiments on three UAV challenging benchmarks demonstrate that the proposed TRTrack achieves superior UAV tracking performance in both precision and efficiency. Quantitative tests in real-world settings fully prove the effectiveness of our work.	https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=10015867	0
Query-Efficient Adversarial Attack With Low Perturbation Against End-to-End Speech Recognition Systems	With the widespread use of automated speech recognition (ASR) systems in modern consumer devices, attack against ASR systems have become an attractive topic in recent years. Although related white-box attack methods have achieved remarkable success in fooling neural networks, they rely heavily on obtaining full access to the details of the target models. Due to the lack of prior knowledge of the victim model and the inefficiency in utilizing query results, most of the existing black-box attack methods for ASR systems are query-intensive. In this paper, we propose a new black-box attack called the Monte Carlo gradient sign attack (MGSA) to generate adversarial audio samples with substantially fewer queries. It updates an original sample based on the elements obtained by a Monte Carlo tree search. We attribute its high query efficiency to the effective utilization of the dominant gradient phenomenon, which refers to the fact that only a few elements of each origin sample have significant effect on the output of ASR systems. Extensive experiments are performed to evaluate the efficiency of MGSA and the stealthiness of the generated adversarial examples on the DeepSpeech system. The experimental results show that MGSA achieves 98% and 99% attack success rates on the LibriSpeech and Mozilla Common Voice datasets, respectively. Compared with the state-of-the-art methods, the average number of queries is reduced by 27% and the signal-to-noise ratio is increased by 31%.	https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9954062	0
Adaptive Extended Kalman Filter-Based Fusion Approach for High-Precision UAV Positioning in Extremely Confined Environments	For unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV)-based smart inspection in extremely confined environments, it is impossible for precise UAV positioning with global positioning system, owing to the satellite signal block. Therefore, the ultrawideband (UWB)-based technology has attracted extensive attention under such circumstances. However, due to the unpredictable propagation condition and the time-varying operational environment, the localization performance oscillation caused by the changing measurement noise may lead to the instability of UAV. To mitigate the effects, in this article, a high-precision UAV positioning system which integrates the inertial measurement unit and UWB with the adaptive extended Kalman filter (EKF) is proposed. Compared with the traditional EKF-based approach, the estimated and recorded information from previous processes is exploited to adaptively estimate and further control the estimation of the noise covariance matrices for the performance improvement. Finally, simulations and experiments have been conducted in extremely confined environments. According to the results, the proposed algorithm can significantly improve the position update rate, the median positioning error, the 95${\text{th}}$ percentile positioning error, and the average standard deviation into 88 Hz, 0.102 m, 0.192 m, and 0.052 m, which is applicable for applications in focused environments.	https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9893405	0
Orientation-Aware Hierarchical, Adaptive-Resolution A* Algorithm for UAV Trajectory Planning	Successful path planning for Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) in challenging environments with narrow openings, such as disaster areas, requires attitude to be considered. State-of-the-art methods incorporate attitude only in the refinement stage. We introduce a first-of-a-kind global minimum cost path search method based on A* that considers attitude along the path. To make the problem tractable, our method exploits an adaptive and coarse-to-fine approach using global and local A* runs, plus an efficient method to introduce the UAV attitude in the process. We integrate our method with an SE(3) trajectory optimisation method based on a safe-flight-corridor, yielding a complete path planning pipeline. Extensive evaluation is undertaken using the AirSim flight simulator under closed loop control in a set of randomised maps, allowing us to quantitatively assess our method. We show that it achieves significantly higher success rates than the baselines, at a reduced computational burden.	https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=10229171	0
Secure Operations of Connected and Autonomous Vehicles	With features of collaborative interaction and autonomous decision-making, connected and autonomous vehicles (CAVs) offer a viable solution for a sustainable and efficient future of transportation. However, with the development of CAVs, questions have been raised about weaknesses in cybersecurity and autonomous driving capabilities. In particular, CAVs provide new opportunities for cyberattackers, posing a significant threat to future road and vehicle data security. Therefore, this paper provides a comprehensive analysis of the cybersecurity environment of CAVs. First, we propose a systematic classification of six security threats from cybersecurity principles: false data, information theft, privilege escalation, block communication, and time delay. We review the cybersecurity environment of CAVs from a lifecycle perspective, covering aspects from development to accident, and present the existing cybersecurity countermeasures. These involve security standards designation, verification and validation of vehicle networks, resilient strategies for self-defined driving, and attack detection and digital forensics. Finally, based on our systematic review, we propose a conceptual vehicle security operations center (VSOC) framework that provides valuable inspiration and references for future research and industrial applications for CAVs cybersecurity.	https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=10216307	0
The Art of Defense: Letting Networks Fool the Attacker	3D perception of objects is critical for many real-world applications, such as autonomous cars and robots. Among them, most state-of-the-art (SOTA) 3D perception systems are based on deep learning models. Recently, the research community found that 3D object classifiers on point cloud based on deep learning are easily fooled by adversarial point cloud craft by attackers. To overcome this, adversarial defenses are considered the most effective ways to improve the robustness of deep learning models, and most adversarial defenses on point cloud are focused on input transformation. However, all previous defense methods decrease the natural accuracy, and the nature of the point cloud classifiers itself has been overlooked. To this end, in this paper, we propose a novel adversarial defense for 3D point cloud classifiers that makes full use of the nature of the point cloud classifiers. Due to the disorder of point cloud, all point cloud classifiers have the property of permutation invariant to the input point cloud. Based on this nature, we design invariant transformations defense (IT-Defense). We show that, even after accounting for obfuscated gradients, our IT-Defense is a resilient defense against SOTA 3D attacks. Moreover, IT-Defense does not hurt clean accuracy compared to previous SOTA 3D defenses. Our code will be available at: https://github.com/cuge1995/ IT-Defense.	https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=10130393	0
Formulating Vehicle Aggressiveness Towards Social Cognitive Autonomous Driving	Accurately identifying the driving threat could greatly improve the driving safety for autonomous vehicles in the mixed traffic, where the human-driven and driverless, as well as different types of vehicles coexist. The existing safety evaluation methods merely focus on the possibility of collision, which is deficient to evaluate the hazard level due to the symmetry for both the interactive vehicles. Thus, the vehicle aggressiveness model is proposed in this paper based on the asymmetric interactions between different types of vehicles from the perspective of the social cognitions in the human driving. Firstly, a new conceptual framework of the vehicle aggressiveness is constructed, and the factors are analyzed. Secondly, the general mathematic formulation of the aggressiveness is deduced elaborately based on the analogy with the mechanical wave. Thirdly, the simplified formulation is derived by introducing resonant assumption, and an illustration of aggressiveness distribution is presented and discussed. The mathematical analysis and simulation results indicate that the proposed model could explicitly describe the asymmetric characteristics as regards the vehicle mass, motion states and position. Finally, the potential applications in safety assessment, decision-making and motion planning of the social cognitive autonomous driving are discussed. The aggressiveness model provides a new perspective in asymmetric driving safety evaluation and heterogeneous driving behavior model under complex and mixed traffic environments.	https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=10007052	0
Active Reconfigurable Intelligent Surface-Assisted MISO Integrated Sensing and Communication Systems for Secure Operation	Spectrum congestion has motivated the recent introduction of integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) systems where radar and communications functionalities co-exist and share the same spectrum. This is accompanied by extensive research in the area of reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (RIS), thanks to their ability to improve the ISAC systems. In this paper, the physical layer security of a multiuser multiple-input single-output (MU-MISO) ISAC system is investigated when the system is subject to eavesdropping by a malicious unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV). In particular, we propose using an active RIS to maximize the achievable secrecy rate of the system through jointly designing the radar receive beamformers, the active RIS reflection coefficients matrix and the transmit beamformers at the dual-function base station of the ISAC system. This is done while taking into account a minimum radar detection signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) and total system power budget constraints. The resulting non-convex optimization problem is tackled by exploiting fractional programming (FP) and majorization-minimization (MM) techniques to achieve a solution. Our numerical results show the superiority of active RIS to achieve the goal when compared with passive RIS or with an ISAC without an RIS. Results also show that passive RIS could still be a viable solution to achieve this goal but at the expense of a much larger needed size especially when lower power budgets are available.	https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9973319	0
A Multiagent Mission Coordination System for Continuous Situational Awareness of Bushfires	This paper devises a multi-agent Mission Coordinating Architecture (MCA) to achieve continuous situational awareness (SA) in bushfires, which can help with quick detection and accurate response to the hazards. In this paper, we use Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) as instantiations of physical agents. MCA is a scalable architecture and aims to provide the UAVs with parallel mission plans, adopting a fire spread probability map and the Fuzzy C-means method to avoid mission overlap and duplicate information. The architecture is then enhanced by integrating a synchronized communication framework to facilitate UAVs’ adaptive cooperation and total flight time optimization. Furthermore, integrating the communication framework minimizes the number of deployed UAVs to fully cover the same area, saving considerable cost and energy compared to the Parallel Mode. The scalability challenge of the Parallel Mode, determining the required number of UAVs to cover the entire area, and the efficiency of the mission planning algorithm are thoroughly investigated and compared to the performance of the Communication Mode. Finally, the simulation results prove the MCA’s effectiveness in enhancing the UAVs’ exploration capability, resulting in comprehensive monitoring of all affected areas. Note to Practitioners—The proposed architecture in this research could offer flexibility to increase the number of UAVs on demand without requiring a change and adjustment of the parameters. Furthermore, a synchronized communication framework enhances MCA, enabling all UAVs to share their resources and exploit residual battery time to assist each other, manage the overall operation time, and reduce the total operation cost.	https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9804398	0
Multi-Agent System for Rogue Drone Interception	A multitude of applications based on unmanned aircraft vehicles (UAVs), in conjunction with the UAVs' diminishing costs and increasing capabilities, present a major threat to public safety as well as critical infrastructure security, leading to the need for versatile and robust counter-drone solutions. This work presents a novel multi-agent jamming system, where a group of cooperative autonomous agents employ various algorithms (detection, tracking, jamming, and self-localization) to counter unauthorized drone operations. The proposed system employs a joint wireless jamming and cooperative positioning framework to best track and intercept the moving rogue drone, utilizing a relative positioning system based on signals of opportunity in conjunction with inertial and vision measurements. Software-defined radio technology is incorporated on the pursuer agent to achieve rogue drone GPS disruption, while at the same time the autonomous agents cooperate to compute the location estimate of the pursuer agent. In the presence of jamming, to improve the wireless communication performance of the autonomous agents, a cellular communication architecture is also used as an additional channel for control and information exchange. For evaluation purposes, a prototype multi-agent system is designed, implemented, and tested in a real-world environment to demonstrate its enhanced localization and jamming performance, when compared to single-agent approaches.	https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=10044959	0
Robust Localization for Secure Navigation of UAV Formations Under GNSS Spoofing Attack	Nowadays, aerial formations are frequently employed in outdoor scenarios to cooperatively explore and monitor wide areas of interest. In these applications, the vehicles are often exposed to relevant security vulnerabilities, as, for instance, the alteration of navigation signals from an attacker with map counterfeiting (if not even hijacking) purposes. In this work, we focus on an Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) formation that monitors an area, wherein navigation spoofing attacks may occur. Letting the UAVs cooperate and exploiting the redundancy in the available sensing information, a distributed procedure is proposed to  $i$ ) detect spoofing attacks, and  $ii$ ) support the navigation in adverse conditions. The validity of the designed approach is confirmed by numerical results. Aerial vehicles for outdoor operation are generally endowed with inertial measurements, relative ranging, and GNSS sensing capability. In this work, two cascaded estimation algorithms for concurrent GNSS spoofing detection and localization in a multi-UAV scenario is proposed, to attain robust navigation in areas subject to GNSS spoofing attacks. The attack detection leverages on information theoretic tools to provide a practical threshold test by checking the multimodal measurement consistency. The localization procedures exploit a decision logic relying on measurement reliability to combine information sources that are different in nature, for UAV self-localization in both safe and under-attack conditions.

D2D-MAP: A Drone to Drone Authentication Protocol Using Physical Unclonable Functions	With the continuous miniaturization of electronic devices and the recent advancements in wireless communication technologies, Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs), in general, and Small Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (SUAVs, a.k.a., drones), in particular, are becoming progressively used by the civilian sector within the context of a variety of applications, bringing great convenience to the public. However, due to their resource-constrained nature, risky environmental application, and wireless way of communication, drones are not immune from cyberthreats. As a consequence, the security of drones (SUAVs) has recently gained significant attention by the research community. In particular, when it comes to inter-drone communication. Although traditional cryptographic techniques may provide a certain level of security, they actually constitute a heavy burden on SUAVs due to their resource-constrained nature. In the light of enforcing the security of inter-drone communications, this paper proposes a lightweight drone-to-drone authentication protocol, called D2D-MAP, that uses PUF (Physical Unclonable Function) technology. We design the protocol and evaluate its resilience against various attacks. We use resource-constrained hardware to implement the authentication protocol and perform an evaluation of its performance. We show that the protocol's security and the obtained performance are prominent compared to state-of-the-art authentication protocols, and that they conform to SUAVs security and performance requirements.	https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9963641	0
ADS-Lead: Lifelong Anomaly Detection in Autonomous Driving Systems	Autonomous Vehicles (AVs) are closely connected in the Cooperative Intelligent Transportation System (C-ITS). They are equipped with various sensors and controlled by Autonomous Driving Systems (ADSs) to provide high-level autonomy. The vehicles exchange different types of real-time data with each other, which can help reduce traffic accidents and congestion, and improve the efficiency of transportation systems. However, when interacting with the environment, AVs suffer from a broad attack surface, and the sensory data are susceptible to anomalies caused by faults, sensor malfunctions, or attacks, which may jeopardize traffic safety and result in serious accidents. In this paper, we propose ADS-Lead, an efficient collaborative anomaly detection methodology to protect the lane-following mechanism of ADSs. ADS-Lead is equipped with a novel transformer-based one-class classification model to identify time series anomalies (GPS spoofing threat) and adversarial image examples (traffic sign and lane recognition attacks). Besides, AVs inside the C-ITS form a cognitive network, enabling us to apply the federated learning technology to our anomaly detection method, where the vehicles in the C-ITS jointly update the detection model with higher model generalization and data privacy. Experiments on Baidu Apollo and two public data sets (GTSRB and Tumsimple) indicate that our method can not only detect sensor anomalies effectively and efficiently but also outperform state-of-the-art anomaly detection methods.	https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9690769	0
Revisiting the Adversarial Robustness-Accuracy Tradeoff in Robot Learning	Adversarial training (i.e., training on adversarially perturbed input data) is a well-studied method for making neural networks robust to potential adversarial attacks during inference. However, the improved robustness does not come for free but rather is accompanied by a decrease in overall model accuracy and performance. Recent work has shown that, in practical robot learning applications, the effects of adversarial training do not pose a fair trade-off but inflict a net loss when measured in holistic robot performance. This work revisits the robustness-accuracy trade-off in robot learning by systematically analyzing if recent advances in robust training methods and theory in conjunction with adversarial robot learning, are capable of making adversarial training suitable for real-world robot applications. We evaluate three different robot learning tasks ranging from autonomous driving in a high-fidelity environment amenable to sim-to-real deployment to mobile robot navigation and gesture recognition. Our results demonstrate that, while these techniques make incremental improvements on the trade-off on a relative scale, the negative impact on the nominal accuracy caused by adversarial training still outweighs the improved robustness by an order of magnitude. We conclude that although progress is happening, further advances in robust learning methods are necessary before they can benefit robot learning tasks in practice.	https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=10032803	0
OQFL: An Optimized Quantum-Based Federated Learning Framework for Defending Against Adversarial Attacks in Intelligent Transportation Systems	Intelligent transportation systems, especially Autonomous Vehicles (AVs), are emerging as a paradigm with the potential to change modern society. However, with this, there is a strong need to ensure the security and privacy of such systems. AV ecosystems depend on machine learning algorithms to autonomously control their operations. Given the amount of personal information AVs collect, coupled with the distributed nature of such ecosystems, there is a movement to employ federated learning algorithms to develop secure decision-making models. Although federated learning is a viable candidate for data privacy, it is vulnerable to adversarial attacks, particularly data poisoning attacks, where malicious vectors would be injected in the training phase. Additionally, hyperparameters play an important role in establishing an efficient federated learning model that can be resilient against adversarial attacks. In this paper, to address these challenges, we propose a novel Optimized Quantum-based Federated Learning (OQFL) framework to automatically adjust the hyperparameters of federated learning using various adversarial attacks in AV settings. This work is innovative in two ways: first, a quantum-behaved particle swarm optimization technique is used to update the hyperparameters of the learning rate, local and global epochs. Second, the proposed technique is utilized within a cyber defense framework to defend against adversarial attacks. The performance of the proposed framework was evaluated using two benchmark datasets: MINST and Fashion-MINST, where they include images that would be extracted from smart cameras of AVs. This framework is shown to be more resilient against various adversarial attacks compared with peer techniques.	https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9641742	0
Fast Tube Model Predictive Control for Driverless Cars Using Linear Data-Driven Models	Model predictive control (MPC) has been widely applied to different aspects of autonomous driving, typically using nonlinear physically derived models for prediction. However, feedback control systems inherently correct for model errors, and thus in many applications it is sufficient to use a linear time-invariant (LTI) model for control design, especially when using robust control methods. This philosophy of approach appears to have been neglected in current driverless car research and is the research gap that we aim to address here. Namely, instead of deriving meticulous nonlinear physical models of vehicle dynamics and solving a correspondingly complex optimal control problem (OCP), we identify a low-order data-driven LTI model and handle its uncertainty via robust linear MPC methods. We develop a two-step control scheme for driverless cars based on tube MPC (TMPC), which introduces structural robustness, ensuring constraint compliance despite modeling error in the data-driven prediction model. Furthermore, we use fast optimization methods designed to exploit the special structure of the linear MPC problem. We evaluate the proposed control scheme using a vehicle model identified from real-world data and simulations in IPGCarmaker, where the model of the vehicle under control is inherently nonlinear and uses detailed 3-D physics. Our results show that an LTI model can be effectively used for the task of lane-keeping, that TMPC can prevent lane departure and possible collisions due to model uncertainty, and that linear models allow for several algorithmic improvements that can decrease computation time by an order of magnitude compared with naive MPC implementations.	https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9966372	0
Jamming-Enhanced Secure UAV Communications With Propulsion Energy and Curvature Radius Constraints	A multi-unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs)-aided secure communication network is studied, where multiple information UAVs carrying temporary aerial base stations transmit confidential information to multiple authorized receivers (ARs), and a jammer UAV is employed to send artificial noise to multiple unauthorized receivers (URs) for mitigating information leakage. Some practical constrains including the inter-UAV interference among the information UAVs and the jammer UAV, the maximal available propulsion energy at UAVs, and the curvature radius limitations of UAVs' trajectories are concurrently taken into account. In order to maximize the minimum secrecy rate among the ARs, the AR scheduling, the UAVs' power allocation and the trajectories of UAVs are jointly optimized by formulating a multi-variable optimization problem. To solve the non-convex problem efficiently, we present a block coordinate descent (BCD)-based approach, where the penalty dual decomposition (PDD)-based algorithm is designed to optimize the AR scheduling, and successive convex approximation (SCA)-based algorithm is proposed to optimize the UAVs' power allocation and the trajectories of UAVs. The complexity of the presented BCD-based approach is analyzed, which achieves polynomial complexity. Simulation results show that imposing curvature radius limitations on the UAVs' trajectory design is effective to avoid sharp turning of UAVs. Moreover, as curvature radius increases, the system max-min secrecy rate decreases. Besides, the secrecy rate performance of the system can be enhanced by exploiting one jammer UAV to interfere with the URs.	https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=10083325	0
MacFormer: Map-Agent Coupled Transformer for Real-Time and Robust Trajectory Prediction	Predicting the future behavior of agents is a fundamental task in autonomous vehicle domains. Accurate prediction relies on comprehending the surrounding map, which significantly regularizes agent behaviors. However, existing methods have limitations in exploiting the map and exhibit a strong dependence on historical trajectories, which yield unsatisfactory prediction performance and robustness. Additionally, their heavy network architectures impede real-time applications. To tackle these problems, we propose Map-Agent Coupled Transformer (MacFormer) for real-time and robust trajectory prediction. Our framework explicitly incorporates map constraints into the network via two carefully designed modules named coupled map and reference extractor. A novel multi-task optimization strategy (MTOS) is presented to enhance learning of topology and rule constraints. We also devise bilateral query scheme in context fusion for a more efficient and lightweight network. We evaluated our approach on Argoverse 1, Argoverse 2, and nuScenes real-world benchmarks, where it all achieved state-of-the-art performance with the lowest inference latency and smallest model size. Experiments also demonstrate that our framework is resilient to imperfect tracklet inputs. Furthermore, we show that by combining with our proposed strategies, classical models outperform their baselines, further validating the versatility of our framework.	https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=10238733	0
Dynamic Scenario Representation Learning for Motion Forecasting With Heterogeneous Graph Convolutional Recurrent Networks	Due to the complex and changing interactions in dynamic scenarios, motion forecasting is a challenging problem in autonomous driving. Most existing works exploit static road graphs to characterize scenarios and are limited in modeling evolving spatio-temporal dependencies in dynamic scenarios. In this letter, we resort to dynamic heterogeneous graphs to model the scenario. Various scenario components including vehicles (agents) and lanes, multi-type interactions, and their changes over time are jointly encoded. Furthermore, we design a novel heterogeneous graph convolutional recurrent network, aggregating diverse interaction information and capturing their evolution, to learn to exploit intrinsic spatio-temporal dependencies in dynamic graphs and obtain effective representations of dynamic scenarios. Finally, with a motion forecasting decoder, our model predicts realistic and multi-modal future trajectories of agents and outperforms state-of-the-art published works on several motion forecasting benchmarks.	https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=10081482	0
A Repeated Unknown Game: Decentralized Task Offloading in Vehicular Fog Computing	Offloading computation to nearby edge/fog computing nodes, including the ones carried by moving vehicles, e.g., vehicular fog nodes (VFN), has proved to be a promising approach for enabling low-latency and compute-intensive mobility applications, such as cooperative and autonomous driving. This work considers vehicular fog computing scenarios where the clients of computation offloading services try to minimize their own costs while deciding which VFNs to offload their tasks. We focus on decentralized multi-agent decision-making in a repeated unknown game where each agent, e.g., service client, can observe only its own action and realized cost. In other words, each agent is unaware of the game composition or even the existence of opponents. We apply a completely uncoupled learning rule to generalize the decentralized decision-making algorithm presented in [7] for the multi-agent case. The multi-agent solution proposed in this work can capture the unknown offloading cost variations susceptive to resource congestion under an adversarial framework where each agent may take implicit cost estimation and suitable resource choice adapting to the dynamics associated with volatile supply and demand. According to the evaluation via simulation, this work reveals that such individual perturbations for robustness to uncertainty and adaptation to dynamicity ensure a certain level of optimality in terms of social welfare, e.g., converging the actual sequence of play with unknown and asymmetric attributes and lowering the correspondent cost in social welfare due to the self-interested behaviors of agents.	https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=10122978	0
An Attentive Spatio-Temporal Learning-Based Network for Cardiovascular Disease Diagnosis	Automated diagnosis of cardiovascular diseases (CVDs) has become an imperative need for remote or in-hospital heart monitoring. This is a challenging task because of the tenuous morphological variation of the electrocardiogram (ECG) signal across different cardiac diseases. Existing works have attempted to learn the diagnostic representation by capturing the lead-specific morphological variation of a multilead ECG signal. In this work, we have developed an attentive spatio-temporal learning network (ASTLNet) that can learn better diagnostic representation by exploiting the concurrent spatio-temporal variation of a multilead ECG signal. The ASTLNet consists of two modules, i.e., spatio-temporal representation learning (STRL) module and attentive spatio-temporal aggregation (ASTA) module. The STRL module is designed to learn the multiscale spatio-temporal representation, and the ASTA module is designed to aggregate the learned representation. Experiments on the three publicly available datasets, i.e., PTB, PTB-XL, and CPSC-2018, demonstrate that the proposed model can effectively learn the spatio-temporal variation of the ECG signal and gives superior performance compared to the state-of-the-art methods.	https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=10080902	0
AI-Empowered Trajectory Anomaly Detection and Classification in 6G-V2X	The immense growth of Autonomous Vehicles (AVs) and networking technologies have paved the way for advanced Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS). AVs increase data demands from in-vehicle users, which pose a significant risk to the vehicular trajectory data and are extremely vulnerable to security threats. It is challenging to describe and detect the trajectory anomalies in urban motion behavior due to the enormous coverage and complexity of ITS in the V2X environment. Most existing systems rely on a restricted number of single detection strategies, such as determining frequent patterns and have limited accuracy in detecting anomalous trajectories. However, they focus only on outlier detection, failing to consider different patterns of anomalous trajectories. This paper proposes Efficient Trajectory Anomaly Detection and Classification (ETADC) framework in a 6G-V2X environment. The proposed ETADC framework employs the Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient algorithm (DDPG) to improve accuracy and efficiency by analyzing multiple strategies, namely driving speed, driving distance, driving direction, and driving time. The result analysis shows that the proposed ETADC technique outperforms the existing systems by 97% accuracy.	https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9863890	0
RFM-GAN: Robust Feature Matching With GAN-Based Neighborhood Representation for Agricultural Remote Sensing Image Registration	Remote sensing (RS) images often encounter various challenges arising from differences in shooting time, location, equipment, sensors, and other factors. These disparities lead to image distortion and insufficient overlap between pairs of images captured at the same location. Consequently, the accuracy of agricultural RS image registration is significantly compromised. This letter proposes a robust feature-matching technique called GAN-based neighborhood representation (RFM-GAN) for the intricate registration of satellite images and unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) images. The RFM-GAN method leverages a neighborhood representation approach based on a generative adversarial network (GAN) with two discriminators. This representation enhances the distinction between true matches (inliers) and false matches (outliers). Additionally, a dissimilarity measure network employing a self-supervised training approach, eliminating the need for manual labeling, is designed to handle the multiview transformation of satellite and UAV images. The experimental results confirm that RFM-GAN outperforms seven other state-of-the-art methods in terms of satellite image and UAV image processing.	https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=10137752	0
Benchmark Evaluation of Hybrid Fixed-Flapping Wing Aerial Robot With Autopilot Architecture for Autonomous Outdoor Flight Operations	This letter is focused on the benchmark evaluation and comparison of the flapping and fixed wing flight modes on an hybrid platform developed for the realization of autonomous inspection operations outdoors. The platform combines the high range and endurance of fixed-wing UAVs (unmanned aerial vehicles), with the higher maneuverability and intrinsic safety of flapping wing in the interaction with humans during the hand launch and capture. A unified model of the hybrid platform is derived for both configurations following the Lagrange formulation to express the multi-body dynamics and aerodynamic forces of the flapping wing and the propellers. The proposed control scheme exploits the similarities of both flight modes in the tail actuation and in the generation of thrust either with the flapping wings or the propellers, in such a way that it can be implemented on conventional autopilots, facilitating in this way the adoption of this type of aerial platforms. To evaluate and compare the performance of both modes, a set of benchmark tests and metrics are defined, including the energy efficiency in forward flight, trajectory tracking, hand launch and capture, and accuracy in visual inspection. Experimental results in outdoors validate the developed prototype, identifying the fixed/flapping transitions, and evidencing the higher energy efficiency of the flapping wing mode compared to the fixed wing.	https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=10138070	0
CGAN-Based Collaborative Intrusion Detection for UAV Networks: A Blockchain-Empowered Distributed Federated Learning Approach	Numerous resource-constrained Internet of Things (IoT) devices make the edge IoT consisting of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) vulnerable to network intrusion. Therefore, it is critical to design an effective intrusion detection system (IDS). However, the differences in local data sets among UAVs show small samples and uneven distribution, further reducing the detection accuracy of network intrusion. This article proposes a conditional generative adversarial net (CGAN)-based collaborative intrusion detection algorithm with blockchain-empowered distributed federated learning to solve the above problems. This study introduces long short-term memory (LSTM) into the CGAN training to improve the effect of generative networks. Based on the feature extraction ability of LSTM networks, the generated data with CGAN are used as augmented data and applied in the detection and classification of intrusion data. Distributed federated learning with differential privacy ensures data security and privacy and allows collaborative training of CGAN models using multiple distributed data sets. Blockchain stores and shares the training models to ensure security when the global model’s aggregation and updating. The proposed method has good generalization ability, which can greatly improve the detection of intrusion data.	https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9863068	0
Comparative Study of Real-Time Semantic Segmentation Networks in Aerial Images During Flooding Events	Real-time semantic segmentation of aerial imagery is essential for unmanned ariel vehicle applications, including military surveillance, land characterization, and disaster damage assessments. Recent real-time semantic segmentation neural networks promise low computation and inference time, appropriate for resource-limited platforms, such as edge devices. However, these methods are mainly trained on human-centric view datasets, such as Cityscapes and CamVid, unsuitable for aerial applications. Furthermore, we do not know the feasibility of these models under adversarial settings, such as flooding events. To solve these problems, we train the most recent real-time semantic segmentation architectures on the FloodNet dataset containing annotated aerial images captured after hurricane Harvey. This article comprehensively studies several lightweight architectures, including encoder–decoder and two-pathway architectures, evaluating their performance on aerial imagery datasets. Moreover, we benchmark the efficiency and accuracy of different models on the FloodNet dataset to examine the practicability of these models during emergency response for aerial image segmentation. Some lightweight models attain more than 60% test mIoU on the FloodNet dataset and yield qualitative results on images. This article highlights the strengths and weaknesses of current segmentation models for aerial imagery, requiring low computation and inference time. Our experiment has direct applications during catastrophic events, such as flooding events.	https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9939092	0
Secure Computation Offloading for Marine IoT: An Energy-Efficient Design via Cooperative Jamming	In smart ocean, the Marine Internet of Things (M-IoT) is ubiquitously used for data acquisition, communication connections, task computation, and so on. However, high-efficient energy consumption and secure yet low-latency transmission is subject to IoT devices' computation capacity and transmit power limitation, as well as wireless communication's broadcast characteristics. In this paper, we investigate the secure computation offloading in M-IoT with the assistance of unmanned surface vehicles (USVs) subject to the eavesdropping attack. In particular, we consider a scenario in which USVs are firstly scheduled to set up a high-quality communication link to the high altitude platform (HAP) and then exploited to provide cooperative jamming for the communication security at the physical layer when the HAP is performing computation offloading. We jointly optimize the USVs' positions, the duration of data uploading, the workload offloaded by HAP, the HAP's transmission power, and each USV's jamming signal power to minimize the system-wise energy consumption for completing the total workloads under the latency constraint. Despite the non-convexity, we decompose the problem vertically into a top problem that optimizes the USVs' positions and a bottom problem that optimizes the other variables. The Polyblock outer Approximation and bisection Search based algorithm (PAS-Algorithm) is proposed to alternatively optimize the variables in the bottom problem. And the Code bAsed croSs Entropy algorithm (CASE-Algorithm) is proposed to obtain the suboptimal solution to the formulated joint optimization problem. Numerical results validate the accuracy and effectiveness of our algorithms as well as the performance of optimizing the total energy consumption compared with the benchmark algorithms.	https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9996964	0
Reference Tracking for Multiagent Systems Using Model Predictive Control	In this note, the reference tracking problem for teams of unmanned vehicles subject to formation constraints is solved via a model predictive control (MPC) algorithm built up in a distributed fashion. By exploiting the properties deriving from a novel kinematic description of the swarm agents, the receding horizon control (RHC) approach is properly adapted to deal with tracking and formation constraints. In particular, neighbor interactions are translated into convex conditions, thanks to an in-depth analysis of the geometric properties arising from the combined use of swarm kinematics and state predictions tubes. Experimental results on Elisa-3 robots show the applicability and effectiveness of the proposed control architecture.	https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9984126	0
RDA: An Accelerated Collision Free Motion Planner for Autonomous Navigation in Cluttered Environments	Autonomous motion planning is challenging in multi-obstacle environments due to nonconvex collision avoidance constraints. Directly applying numerical solvers to these nonconvex formulations fails to exploit the constraint structures, resulting in excessive computation time. In this letter, we present an accelerated collision-free motion planner, namely regularized dual alternating direction method of multipliers (RDADMM or RDA for short), for the model predictive control (MPC) based motion planning problem. The proposed RDA addresses nonconvex motion planning via solving a smooth biconvex reformulation via duality and allows the collision avoidance constraints to be computed in parallel for each obstacle to reduce computation time significantly. We validate the performance of the RDA planner through path-tracking experiments with car-like robots in both simulation and real-world settings. Experimental results show that the proposed method generates smooth collision-free trajectories with less computation time compared with other benchmarks and performs robustly in cluttered environments.	https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=10036019	0
Federated Imitation Learning for UAV Swarm Coordination in Urban Traffic Monitoring	The popularization of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) has boosted various civil applications such as traffic monitoring, in which the effective coordination of the UAV swarm plays a significant role in expanding the monitoring range and enhancing the execution efficiency. However, due to the isolated local environments as well as the heterogeneous execution capabilities, it is challenging to achieve highly consistent actions. In this article, we incorporate the federated learning framework with the imitation learning technique to coordinate the UAVs' maneuvers by interactively imitating the leader UAV's operations. During the interagent global model download phase, we utilize the generative adversarial imitation learning (GAIL) model to accurately follow the leader UAV's operations by removing the biased estimates of imitation parameters. While in the intraagent local model training phase, we utilize the self-imitation learning (SIL) model to correct delicate imitation errors by virtue of the follower UAVs' own historical valuable experiences. In order to achieve more efficient distributed parameter interactions, we regularize the federated gradient updates and eventually yield coordinated swarm policies. We evaluate the proposed algorithm in the UAV-based traffic monitoring scenario. Evaluation results demonstrate the superiorities on training and execution efficiencies.	https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9834117	0
Adaptive Resilient Control for Cyber-Physical Systems Under Cyberattack and Input Saturation	This article investigates the resilient control problem for nonlinear cyber-physical systems with hybrid cyberattacks and physical constraints, including aperiodic denial-of-service attacks, deception attacks, input saturation, and external disturbances. The underlying system is described by the fuzzy model by decomposing the nonlinear plant into some local linear subsystems. An input saturating integrator and an antiwindup compensator are introduced inside a dynamic output feedback fuzzy controller to handle the input saturation in both amplitude and rate. Within the resulting fuzzy-model-based control framework, a novel adaptive event-triggered-based resilient control method is proposed to ensure that the insecure and imperfect system is stochastically stable with an $H_\infty$ performance level. Simulation results of an autonomous vehicle operating in a wireless network environment are provided to verify the effectiveness of the proposed control method.	https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9857600	0
Dynamic Watermarking for Cybersecurity of Autonomous Vehicles	Autonomous vehicles (AVs) are rapidly proliferating. However, their future adoption is dependent on guarantees of their safety and security. Studies have shown that AVs are vulnerable to malicious cyberattacks with potentially lethal consequences. It is, therefore, imperative to deploy defensive techniques to enhance their cybersecurity. The method of dynamic watermarking (DW) has been proposed as an active technique for cyber-physical systems to detect cyberattacks. In this study, DW is implemented on an actual AV. It is shown that the DW technique is effective for timely detection of different types of attacks on the yaw rate measurement under autonomous operation, and thereby, allows recourse to measures such as stopping or pulling off to the side to prevent collisions.	https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9994719	0
A Non-Optimization-Based Dynamic Path Planning for Autonomous Obstacle Avoidance	This article presents a non-optimization-based framework for path planning and tracking for evasive maneuvers in autonomous cars. The framework exploits a two-layer approach where a path planner generates a reference trajectory that is then tracked by a path-tracking controller. A nested curvature preview controller (CPC) implements path tracking. In this article, we show how to describe the closed-loop performance of the controller. The quantification of the closed-loop performance in the frequency domain guides the generation of the evasive path. In this way, the algorithm generates a path that avoids the obstacle (if possible) accounting for both static and dynamic constraints. The proposed framework, thus, provides a non-optimization-based way to integrate the characteristics of the path tracker in the path-planner algorithm, thus avoiding the need to define cost functions and use the third-party optimizers. This article validates the proposed evasive maneuver strategy in simulation and on an instrumented vehicle. First, we test the trajectory tracker, showing that it tracks aggressive trajectories (with a lateral acceleration close to 1 g) with an error smaller than 30 cm. Subsequently, we integrate the curvature preview with the path generator and show the joint generation-tracking performance in two different scenarios.	https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9867928	0
Learning When to Use Adaptive Adversarial Image Perturbations Against Autonomous Vehicles	Deep neural network (DNN) models are widely used in autonomous vehicles for object detection using camera images. However, these models are vulnerable to adversarial image perturbations. Existing methods for generating these perturbations use the image frame as the decision variable, resulting in a computationally expensive optimization process that starts over for each new image. Few approaches have been developed for attacking online image streams while considering the physical dynamics of autonomous vehicles, their mission, and the environment. To address these challenges, we propose a multi-level stochastic optimization framework that monitors the attacker's capability to generate adversarial perturbations. Our framework introduces a binary decision attack/not attack based on the attacker's capability level to enhance its effectiveness. We evaluate our proposed framework using simulations for vision-guided autonomous vehicles and actual tests with a small indoor drone in an office environment. Our results demonstrate that our method is capable of generating real-time image attacks while monitoring the attacker's proficiency given state estimates.	https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=10138012	0
Dynamic UAV Swarm Confrontation: An Imitation Based on Mobile Adaptive Networks	Cooperative unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) swarms could expand the mission capability of the single UAV and the overall combat effectiveness. We consider the dynamic scenarios where an UAV swarm confronts multiple maneuvering high-value targets (HVTs) and multiple maneuvering attackers. In such hostile scenarios, each UAV of the UAV swarm would generally strive to survive through collaboratively offending their opponents and self-defense from potential attacks. We consider modeling UAV swarms as biologically inspired mobile adaptive networks to imitate the dynamic confrontations of UAV swarms. It is essential to develop an efficient motion control mechanism underpinned by both target tracking and decision making so as to enhance the capability of UAV swarms. We formulate a distributed modularized framework incorporating collaboratively tracking multiple opponents, making successive and prompt decisions, and controlling motion mechanism for mobile adaptive networks. We develop the diffusion multitask interactive Kalman filter to efficiently track multiple preys (HVTs) and multiple predators (attackers). We further develop the collaborative decision making on prey pursuit or predator evasion such that each UAV would acquire early warnings and predictions of the most hypothetically threatening predators to enhance the effectiveness of self-defense. Moreover, we develop a composite motion control mechanism, such that each UAV would be steered toward the prey or away from any approaching predator in a self-organized manner at a variable speed. The modular design of the proposed framework would promote the affordability and adaptability of UAV swarms. Illustrative simulation results validate the efficacy of the proposed distributed framework and the underlying algorithms.	https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=10158783	0
Robust Image-Based Landing Control of a Quadrotor on an Unpredictable Moving Vehicle Using Circle Features	This paper addresses the landing problem of a quadrotor on an unpredictable moving vehicle, using a robust image-based visual servoing (IBVS) method. The circle-based image moments are defined to construct image dynamics, and the passivity-like property of the circle features is preserved by reprojecting to the virtual image plane. The landing control system is decoupled into translation and rotation modules due to the rotation invariance of the proposed circle features. First, by exploiting the error transformation in the image space, a robust IBVS controller can overcome the lack of both the desired depth information of target features and the velocity feedback of the target. Next, an adaptive geometric attitude controller is developed directly using rotation matrices to avoid the singularities of Euler-angles and the ambiguity of quaternions. One benefit of the proposed scheme is that it can potentially improve the camera visibility, guarantee the transient and steady-state behaviors in image space, and be efficiently implemented on the low-cost quadrotor. Finally, The stability analysis is presented using Lyapunov stability theory on cascaded systems, and the effectiveness of the proposed control strategy is demonstrated through simulations and experiments. Note to Practitioners—The motivation of this paper is to investigate a practical control strategy for the image-based landing control of underactuated quadrotors on an unpredictable moving vehicle. In most of the existing image-based landing control schemes for underactuated quadrotors, having the prior predictive model of the moving landing vehicle to provide a feed-forward compensation during the landing maneuver. However, due to the fact that the landing environment and vehicle are primarily stochastic, resulting in no predictive models are valid in practice. Therefore, this paper suggests a robust image-based landing control strategy without the model or state of the moving landing vehicle. In particular, a novel virtual circle feature, possessing the characteristic of rotation invariance, is designed for the landing of underactuated quadrotors, which decouples the landing system and simplifies the control design. Moreover, the image feature errors are directly retained within prescribed performance funnels in the image space. As a result, the transient and steady-state landing behaviors can be implicitly guaranteed in Cartesian space. The stability and convergence of the system are analyzed mathematically and the experiment using quadrotors provides promising results. In ongoing research, we are addressing the issues of collision avoidances and unknown disturbances to provide a more realistic setup for the autonomous deployment and recovery of underactuated quadrotors in GPS-denied environments.	https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9791477	0
QoS-Dependent Event-Triggered Control for UAVs on Cognitive Radio Networks Subject to Deception Attacks	Based on cognitive radio (CR) networks, this paper considers event-triggered control for unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) systems subject to deception attacks. Two states (ON and OFF) are switched in CR networks. For the switched model, a new Quality of Service (QoS)-dependent event-triggered scheme (ETS) is proposed over CR networks under deception attacks. For a non-ideal QoS, more sensitive trigger parameters are required against deception attacks. For an ideal QoS, less sensitive trigger parameters are adjusted to reduce data transmissions. Based on the QoS-dependent ETS, a new switched system is modeled subject to deception attacks. By constructing the Lyapunov functional, the criteria are obtained to guarantee the exponential mean-square stability of UAV systems and the desired $\mathcal {L}_{\infty }$ performance. Moreover, an algorithm is developed to adjust the parameters of QoS-dependent ETS according to the QoS of CR network. Finally, an UAV system is utilized to show the effectiveness of the proposed approach.	https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=10111014	0
Distributed Hierarchical Shared Control for Flexible Multirobot Maneuver Through Dense Undetectable Obstacles	When teleoperating a multirobot system (MRS) in outdoor environments, human operators can often detect obstacles that are not detected by robots and spot emergencies faster than robots do. However, the lack of efficient methods for operators to manipulate an MRS has limited the number of robots in a human–robot team. To handle this problem, a distributed hierarchical shared control scheme is proposed, aiming to provide a safe and flexible control interface for a few human operators to interact with a large MRS. The proposed hierarchical control scheme employs a two-layered structure. In the upper layer, intention field networks are designed to generate virtual human control signals. Two functionalities for human teleoperation, called: 1) group management and 2) motion intervention, are realized using intention fields, allowing the operators to split the robot formation into different groups and steer individual robots away from immediate danger. In parallel, a blending-based shared control algorithm is designed in the lower layer to resolve the conflict between human intervention inputs and autonomous formation control signals. The input-to-output stability (IOS) of the proposed distributed hierarchical shared control scheme is proved by exploiting the properties of weighting functions. Results from a usability testing experiment and a physical experiment are also presented to validate the effectiveness and practicability of the proposed method.	https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9612716	0
MTANet: Multitask-Aware Network With Hierarchical Multimodal Fusion for RGB-T Urban Scene Understanding	Understanding urban scenes is a fundamental ability requirement for assisted driving and autonomous vehicles. Most of the available urban scene understanding methods use red-green-blue (RGB) images; however, their segmentation performances are prone to degradation under adverse lighting conditions. Recently, many effective artificial neural networks have been presented for urban scene understanding and have shown that incorporating RGB and thermal (RGB-T) images can improve segmentation accuracy even under unsatisfactory lighting conditions. However, the potential of multimodal feature fusion has not been fully exploited because operations such as simply concatenating the RGB and thermal features or averaging their maps have been adopted. To improve the fusion of multimodal features and the segmentation accuracy, we propose a multitask-aware network (MTANet) with hierarchical multimodal fusion (multiscale fusion strategy) for RGB-T urban scene understanding. We developed a hierarchical multimodal fusion module to enhance feature fusion and built a high-level semantic module to extract semantic information for merging with coarse features at various abstraction levels. Using the multilevel fusion module, we exploited low-, mid-, and high-level fusion to improve segmentation accuracy. The multitask module uses boundary, binary, and semantic supervision to optimize the MTANet parameters. Extensive experiments were performed on two benchmark RGB-T datasets to verify the improved performance of the proposed MTANet compared with state-of-the-art methods.1	https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9749834	0
AIRA-DA: Adversarial Image Reconstruction Alignments for Unsupervised Domain Adaptive Object Detection	Unsupervised domain adaptive object detection is a challenging perception task where object detectors are adapted from a label-rich source domain to an unlabeled target domain, playing a vital role in autonomous driving and robot navigation. Since the camera settings, weather, and light conditions vary depending on the road, it is labor-intensive and impossible to manually annotate all the data to adapt to these scenarios. Recent advances demonstrate the effectiveness of adversarial-based domain alignment, where domain invariance in the feature space is produced by adversarial training between the feature extractor and domain discriminator. However, due to the domain shift, domain discrimination, especially on low-level features, is an easy task. This results in an imbalance of the adversarial training between the domain discriminator and the feature extractor. In this work, we achieve a better domain alignment by introducing an auxiliary regularization task to improve the training balance. Specifically, we propose Adversarial Image Reconstruction (AIR) as the regularizer to facilitate the adversarial training of the feature extractor. We further design a multi-level Feature Alignment(A) module to enhance the adaptation performance. We refer our work as AIRA-DA for ease of presentation. Our evaluations across several datasets of challenging domain shifts demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms all previous methods, of both one- and two-stage, in most settings. Extensive experiments shows that the proposed method is capable of handling weather variation, cross-camera adaptation and synthetic-to-real-world adaptation.	https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=10103159	0
Joint Optimization of Relay Selection and Transmission Scheduling for UAV-Aided mmWave Vehicular Networks	To deal with the explosive growth of mobile traffic, millimeter-wave (mmWave) communications with abundant bandwidth resources have been applied to vehicular networks. As mmWave signal is sensitive to blockage, we introduce the unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV)-aided two-way relaying system for vehicular connection enhancement and coverage expansion. How to improve transmission efficiency and to reduce latency time in such a dynamic scenario is a challenging problem. In this paper, we formulate the joint optimization problem of relay selection and transmission scheduling, aiming to reduce transmission time while meeting the throughput requirements. To solve this problem, two schemes are proposed. The first one is the random relay selection with concurrent scheduling (RCS), a low-complexity algorithm implemented in two steps. The second one is the joint relay selection with dynamic scheduling (JRDS), which fully avoids relay contentions and exploits potential concurrent ability, to obtain further performance enhancement over RCS. Through extensive simulations under different environments with various flow numbers and vehicle speeds, we demonstrate that both RCS and JRDS schemes outperform the existing schemes significantly in terms of transmission time and network throughput. We also analyze the impact of threshold selection on achievable performance.	https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=10012329	0
PCPNet: An Efficient and Semantic-Enhanced Transformer Network for Point Cloud Prediction	The ability to predict future structure features of environments based on past perception information is extremely needed by autonomous vehicles, which helps to make the following decision-making and path planning more reasonable. Recently, point cloud prediction (PCP) is utilized to predict and describe future environmental structures by the point cloud form. In this letter, we propose a novel efficient Transformer-based network to predict the future LiDAR point clouds exploiting the past point cloud sequences. We also design a semantic auxiliary training strategy to make the predicted LiDAR point cloud sequence semantically similar to the ground truth and thus improves the significance of the deployment for more tasks in real-vehicle applications. Our approach is completely self-supervised, which means it does not require any manual labeling and has a solid generalization ability toward different environments. The experimental results show that our method outperforms the state-of-the-art PCP methods on the prediction results and semantic similarity, and has a good real-time performance.	https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=10141631	0
Neural-Network-Based Fuzzy Observer With Data-Driven Uncertainty Identification for Vehicle Dynamics Estimation Under Extreme Driving Conditions: Theory and Experimental Results	We present a neural network based Takagi-Sugeno (TS) fuzzy observer to estimate the lateral speed (or sideslip angle) of nonlinear vehicle dynamics subject to modeling uncertainties and unknown inputs. To this end, we first propose a TS fuzzy reduced-order observer design, which can be implemented with low computation effort, for nonlinear systems. The stability and robustness of the observer scheme against the modeling uncertainty is guaranteed by the $\mathscr {H}_{\infty }$ filtering method. A data-driven approach is proposed to construct feedforward neural networks (NNs) for uncertainty approximation. This data-driven approach exploits a specific sliding mode observer (SMO) to identify the model uncertainty data from the collected training data. The NN-based uncertainty approximation is incorporated into the TS fuzzy observer structure to mitigate the effect of uncertainty and improve the estimation quality. Via Lyapunov's stability theory, design conditions of both the TS fuzzy reduced-order observer for dynamics estimation and the SMO for uncertainty identification are derived in terms of linear matrix inequalities. Experimental results obtained with the INSA autonomous vehicle on a real test track demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed TS fuzzy observer under various driving scenarios. Performance comparisons are also performed to illustrate the interest of using NN-based uncertainty approximation for the new reduced-order observer scheme, especially under extreme driving conditions.	https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=10054430	0
UAV-Assisted Multi-Access Computation Offloading via Hybrid NOMA and FDMA in Marine Networks	With the rapid development of marine networks, there have been growing demands for computation-intensive and delay-sensitive marine applications and services. However, the limited underwater energy supply and the acoustic channels result in the low efficiency for computing tasks and high transmission delay. In this paper, we investigate the unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs)-assisted multi-access computation offloading in marine networks, with the objective of minimizing the energy consumption of ocean devices. Specifically, for the underwater segment, we consider the scenario that multiple underwater sensor nodes (USNs) covered by the unmanned surface vehicle (USV) upload their sensing data via non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) for improving the channel utilization. For the radio frequency segment, we consider the scenario that multiple UAVs hovering in the air act as the aerial edge servers for providing computing services, in which the USV offloads the workloads to UAVs via frequency division multiple access (FDMA) for avoiding their co-channel interference, while taking into account that a malicious node overhears the USV's offloading transmission. To improve the computation offloading efficiency, we formulate an optimization problem for USNs and USV to minimize the total energy consumption by jointly optimizing the USN's uploading time, USV's computation offloading, USV's offloading time, and the secrecy provisioning. Despite the non-convexity of the formulated joint optimization problem, we exploit a layered structure to decompose the problem, and propose efficient algorithms to obtain the optimal solutions. Finally, we conduct simulations to validate the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed algorithms. Numerical results demonstrate that our algorithms can significantly reduce the energy consumption in comparison with the benchmark schemes.	https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9882311	0
Secure Control Design for Networked Control Systems With Nonlinear Dynamics Under Time-Delay-Switch Attacks	A continuous controller is developed for a centralized network control system (NCS), which is composed of agents with nonlinear dynamics subject to a time-delay-switch (TDS) attack and additive disturbances. Since the state tracking error is unmeasurable during TDS attacks, controllers cannot use the state tracking error to coordinate the NCS. Therefore, a novel error signal is designed to address this unique challenge and enable the NCS to achieve a formation control objective. Furthermore, a TDS attack mitigation strategy is developed, which uses both learning- and model-based approaches to estimate an agent’s state for TDS attack detection and compensation. Lyapunov–Krasovskii functionals are used in the stability analysis to prove that the tracking errors converge to a steady-state residual, which is a function of the system uncertainty and TDS attack properties. The leader–follower formation control problem for unmanned aerial vehicles based on a pure pursuit guidance law is selected for a simulation study to validate the performance of the proposed method.	https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9720959	0
Application of Graph Learning With Multivariate Relational Representation Matrix in Vehicular Social Networks	The essence of connection in vehicle network is the social relationship between people, and thus Vehicular Social Networks (VSNs), characterized by social aspects and features, can be formed. The information collected by VSNs can be used for context prediction of autonomous vehicles. Multivariate relations are common in square connected relations caused by geographic characteristics in VSNs. They can effectively reflect the high-order structural features of the network dataset. It is necessary to exploit the multivariate relations of VSNs to improve the performance of context prediction. However, The representation of entity-relationes in the network often adopts a binary form, and the existing graph learning methods rely on the neighborhood information of nodes to achieve the aggregation or diffusion of information. Using this to represent multivariate relations will result in partial omissions or even complete loss of valuable information, which ultimately affects the learning effect of learning methods. In order to better understand the social behavior of the VSNs, this paper uses the network motif to implement the representation of the multivariate relations in the network, and proposes the graPh learnIng with moTif mAtrix (PITA) method. This method can be used as a preprocessing step for the measurement strategy of the relations in VSNs and the graph learning, which can mine the information in VSNs and improve the accuracy of the original graph learning method by the multivariate relation information. We performed experiments on 6 network datasets. The experimental results show that in the node classification task, the baseline method modified by the PITA method has a higher classification accuracy than the original method.	https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9966312	0
Fast Reactive Mechanism for Desired Trajectory Attacks on Unmanned Aerial Vehicles	Malware, exposed on the ground control station, can tamper with the unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) interaction information. It makes UAVs vulnerable to the desired trajectory attacks, which deteriorates the flight safety if no timely action is taken. Therefore, this article focus on fast reactive mechanism for desired trajectory attacks on UAVs. A fixed-time detection scheme is proposed based on fixed-time unknown inputs observer and trajectory tracking errors. Subsequently, a fixed-time sliding mode attack observer is developed to compensate the effect caused by attacks. Meanwhile, the estimation errors of attacks can be stabilized within fixed time. Finally, experiment tests are presented to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed methods.	https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9964293	0
Infrastructure-Enabled GPS Spoofing Detection and Correction	Accurate and robust localization is crucial for supporting high-level driving automation and safety. Modern localization solutions rely on various sensors, among which GPS has been and will continue to be essential. However, GPS can be vulnerable to malicious attacks and GPS spoofing has been identified as a high threat. With transportation infrastructure becoming increasingly important in supporting emerging vehicle technologies and systems, this study explores the potential of applying infrastructure data for defending against GPS spoofing. We propose an infrastructure-enabled framework using roadside units as an independent, secured data source. A real-time detector, based on the Isolation Forest, is constructed to detect GPS spoofing. Once spoofing is detected, GPS measurements are isolated, and the potentially compromised location estimator is corrected using secure infrastructure data. We test the proposed method using both simulation and real-world data and show its effectiveness in defending against various GPS spoofing attacks, including stealthy attacks that are proposed to fail the production-grade autonomous driving systems.	https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=10208233	0
AoI-Aware Resource Allocation for Platoon-Based C-V2X Networks via Multi-Agent Multi-Task Reinforcement Learning	This paper investigates the problem of age of information (AoI) aware radio resource management for a platooning system. Multiple autonomous platoons exploit the cellular wireless vehicle-to-everything (C-V2X) communication technology to disseminate the cooperative awareness messages (CAMs) to their followers while ensuring timely delivery of safety-critical messages to the Road-Side Unit (RSU). To lower the computational load at the RSU and cope with the challenges of dynamic channel conditions, we exploit a distributed resource allocation framework based on multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL), where each platoon leader (PL) acts as an agent and interacts with the environment to learn its optimal policy. Motivated by the existing literature in RL, we propose two novel MARL frameworks based on the multi-agent deep deterministic policy gradient (MADDPG), named Modified MADDPG, and Modified MADDPG with task decomposition. Both algorithms train two critics with the following goals: A global critic which estimates the global expected reward and motivates the agents toward a cooperating behavior and an exclusive local critic for each agent that estimates the local individual reward. Furthermore, based on the tasks each agent has to accomplish, in the second algorithm, the holistic individual reward of each agent is decomposed into multiple sub-reward functions where task-wise value functions are learned separately. Numerical results indicate our proposed algorithms' effectiveness compared with other contemporary RL frameworks, e.g., federated reinforcement learning (FRL) in terms of AoI performance and CAM message transmission probability.	https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=10077432	0
Optimizing Vehicle Re-Ordering Events in Coordinated Autonomous Intersection Crossings Under CAVs' Location Uncertainty	Road intersections represent the primary bottleneck in transportation systems and connected autonomous vehicles (CAVs) have the potential to aleviate the problem through communication and coordination. As such, this work proposes a novel framework where, accounting for CAVs' location uncertainty, an intersection manager (IM) controls CAVs approaching a road crossing so as to maximize the number of admitted vehicles, while ensuring a guaranteed (tunable) level of safety. To fully exploit the communication links among the IM and the CAVs, several features are included in the proposed framework: (i) periodic re-optimizations of the CAVs' applied controls; (ii) periodic re-ordering of the intersection crossing sequence; and (iii) event-based control and ordering optimizations to achieve the best possible trade-off between complexity and performance. The proposed framework is able to improve both the number of admitted CAVs to the intersection and the CAVs' average speeds as compared to relevant state-of-the-art solutions. Importantly, when event-triggering is applied, most of the benefits introduced by periodic optimizations are retained, while at the same time the number of re-optimizations required are reduced by 47.6% (34.18%) during average (heavy) traffic conditions.	https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9976239	0
Jamming the Relay-Assisted Multi-User Wireless Communication System: A Zero-Sum Game Approach	Recently, various wireless Internet-of-Things devices and unmanned aerial vehicles have been frequently used to facilitate daily life. On the other hand, they can also pose serious threats to public security if maliciously used. A countermeasure against these threats is to transmit jamming signals to break the communication links between attacker and wireless devices. However, this is not easy since modern multi-device (multi-user) wireless communication systems are smart in avoiding jamming. Moreover, a relay is widely used to improve the jamming resistance. To successfully jam those malicious devices, we consider a jamming and anti-jamming zero-sum game, in which the attacker tries to maximize the sum-rate of a relay-assisted wireless system and the jammer tries to minimize it. Finding the equilibrium is challenging due to its non-convexity and complex structure. We address this problem in two cases. Specifically, in the single-device (single-user) case, we show that putting the whole jamming power to either relay or device achieves the Nash equilibrium. In the multi-device case, an efficient method is developed, which transforms this game into a min-max optimization problem and decouples it into two sub-problems by the hybrid block successive approximation method. The resultant sub-problems are solved by the multi-block alternating direction method of multipliers and the block successive upper-bound minimization method of multipliers, respectively. Then, a stationary point of the original problem can be iteratively achieved. Numerical results demonstrate that the two proposed jamming methods outperform many traditional methods.	https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=10128833	0
Dynamic Object Classification of Low-Resolution Point Clouds: An LSTM-Based Ensemble Learning Approach	In unmanned vehicle perception, dynamic object classification is applied to classify objects accurately and timely, providing decision-making for obstacle avoidance and planning. Low-resolution LiDAR is one of the most important sensors for this task. Unfortunately, the existing approaches perform unsatisfactorily due to the huge domain gap between low-resolution and high-resolution point cloud classification. Some schemes try to reduce the gap by fusing multi-scan information through SLAM or completing single-scan point clouds. However, these methods rely on high positioning accuracy or the wholeness of object data. To this end, differently, we propose a dynamic object classification method of low-resolution data from the perspective of time-series fusion. By modeling time series of sparse data, we indicate change rules of separate classification models for object representation. Subsequently, based on ensemble learning, our method performs feature-level fusion on multiple networks to exploit their different expression capabilities. Finally, we utilize long short-term memory to gradually classify dynamic objects. Besides, we also propose a dataset of the low-resolution point clouds and manually annotate the ground truth, which contains abundant samples of cars, pedestrians, and motorcycles. Through testing actual low-resolution data, the accuracy of our method is verified to improve a lot than the state-of-the-art approaches.	https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=10286119	0
Cyber-Physical System-Based Path Tracking Control of Autonomous Vehicles Under Cyber-Attacks	As one of the typical applications of cyberphysical system (CPS), autonomous vehicles (AVs) are vulnerable to malicious disturbance from cyberattacks while tracking the desired path. This article focuses on CPS-based path tracking control problem of AVs under cyberattacks. First, the nonlinear state and measurement equations of AVs under cyberattacks are established based on vehicle dynamics model. Second, to improve the robustness of AVs against cyberattacks, sensor redundancy is introduced. A cyberattack detection method is designed by using extended Kalman filter, and the computational complexity of the cyberattack detection method is analyzed. In addition, sensor switching rules are developed to isolate the disturbance of cyberattacks. Then, the control problem of the AVs is formulated based on model predictive control. Input-to-state stability of the control system under cyberattacks is established, and a link between the tolerable attack intensity and the detection thresholds is clearly revealed. Finally, the simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed control strategy.	https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9889204	0
Resilient Countermeasures Against Cyber-Attacks on Self-Driving Car Architecture	Self-driving cars, believed to be on track to become a seven trillion-dollar industry by 2050, are likely to be a popular mode of transportation in the near future, as the technology promises safety and efficiency. Significant advances have been made to achieve these objectives. However, the idea of a self-driving car completing its goals without human intervention in the presence of uncertainties is still posed with challenges. These challenges mostly relate to decision-making under uncertainties that could arise from transient faults or deliberate attempts to disrupt the system in favor of adversarial motives. Traditional schemes of hardening the system against known compromises will not suffice primarily because of the sophistication adversarial attempts have come to achieve and the rate at which new attacks are being devised. The problem demands a solution that is resilient to attacks and that would allow a self-driving vehicle to complete its designated task in the presence of attacks or faults. Several attempts have been made towards achieving resilience in autonomous vehicles. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work to give a thorough review on the resilient approaches adopted in the context and presents a taxonomy of such approaches. The paper also includes a brief introduction to the architecture of self-driving vehicles and its vulnerabilities in the presented context. This paper also discusses a novel approach using N-version programming for resilience.	https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=10168308	0
Mobility-Aware Multi-Hop Task Offloading for Autonomous Driving in Vehicular Edge Computing and Networks	Vehicular Edge Computing (VEC) has gained increasing interest due to its potential to provide low latency and reduce the load in backhaul networks. In order to meet drastically increasing computation demands from emerging ever-growing vehicular applications, e.g., autonomous driving, abundant computation resources of individual vehicles can play a crucial role in task execution in a VEC scenario, that can further contribute in considerably improving user experience. This is however an extremely challenging task due to high mobility of vehicles that can easily lead to intermittent connectivity, thereby disrupting on-going task processing. In this paper, we propose a task offloading scheme by exploiting multi-hop vehicle computation resources in VEC based on mobility analysis of vehicles. In addition to the vehicles within one hop from the task vehicle that generates computation tasks, certain multi-hop vehicles that meet the given requirements in terms of link connectivity and computation capacity, are also leveraged to carry out the tasks offloaded by the task vehicle. An optimization problem is formulated for the task vehicle to minimize the weighted sum of execution time and computation cost of all tasks. A semidefinite relaxation approach with an adaptive adjustment procedure is proposed to solve the formulated optimization problem for obtaining the corresponding offloading decisions. The simulation results show that our proposed offloading scheme can achieve significant improvement in terms of response delay by at least 34% compared with the other algorithms (e.g., local processing and random offloading).	https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9686591	0
LoS-Map Construction for Proactive Relay of Opportunity Selection in 6G V2X Systems	Recent advances in Vehicle-to-Everything (V2X) technology and the upcoming sixth-generation (6G) network will dawn a new era for vehicular services with enhanced communication capabilities. Connected and Autonomous Vehicles (CAVs) are expected to deliver a new transportation experience, increasing the safety and efficiency of road networks. The use of millimeter-wave (mmW) frequencies guarantees a huge amount of bandwidth ($>$1 GHz) and a high data rate ($>$10 Gbit/s), which are required for CAVs applications. However, high frequency is impaired by severe path loss, and line of sight (LoS) propagation can be easily blocked by static and dynamic obstacles. Several solutions are being investigated, and the most promising one exploits relays. However, traditional relay schemes react to link failure and leverage instantaneous information, which impedes efficient relay selection in highly mobile and complex networks, such as vehicular scenarios. In this context, we propose a novel proactive relaying strategy that exploits the cooperation between CAVs and environment information to predict the dynamic LoS-map, which describes the links' evolution in time. The proactive relaying schemes exploit the dynamic LoS-map to maximize the network connectivity. A novel framework integrating realistic mobility patterns and geometric channel propagation models is proposed to analyze the performance in different scenarios. Numerical simulations suggest that a novel proactive relaying strategy that exploits the cooperation between CAVs and environment information to predict the dynamic LoS-map, which describes the links' evolution in time.	https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9932026	0
ST$^{2}$: Spatial-Temporal State Transformer for Crowd-Aware Autonomous Navigation	Empowering an intelligent agent with the ability of autonomous navigation in complex and dynamic environments is an important and active research topic in embodied artificial intelligence. In this letter, we address this challenging task from the view of exploiting both the spatial and temporal states of a mobile robot interacting with the crowded environment. Specifically, we propose a Spatial-Temporal State Transformer (ST$^{2}$) to encode the states while leveraging the deep reinforcement learning method to find the optimal navigation policy accordingly. Technically, the proposed ST$^{2}$ model consists of a global spatial state encoder and a temporal state encoder, which are built upon the Transformer structure. The spatial state encoder is devised to extract the global spatial features and capture the spatial interaction between pedestrians and the robot. The temporal state encoder is designed to model the temporal correlation among consecutive frames and infer the dynamic relationship of the spatial position transformation. Based on the comprehensive spatial-temporal state representation, the value-based reinforcement learning method is leveraged to obtain the optimal navigation policy. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superiority of the proposed ST$^{2}$ over representative state-of-the-art methods. The source code will be made publicly available.	https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=10007923	0
A Time-Delay Feedback Neural Network for Discriminating Small, Fast-Moving Targets in Complex Dynamic Environments	Discriminating small moving objects within complex visual environments is a significant challenge for autonomous micro-robots that are generally limited in computational power. By exploiting their highly evolved visual systems, flying insects can effectively detect mates and track prey during rapid pursuits, even though the small targets equate to only a few pixels in their visual field. The high degree of sensitivity to small target movement is supported by a class of specialized neurons called small target motion detectors (STMDs). Existing STMD-based computational models normally comprise four sequentially arranged neural layers interconnected via feedforward loops to extract information on small target motion from raw visual inputs. However, feedback, another important regulatory circuit for motion perception, has not been investigated in the STMD pathway and its functional roles for small target motion detection are not clear. In this article, we propose an STMD-based neural network with feedback connection (feedback STMD), where the network output is temporally delayed, then fed back to the lower layers to mediate neural responses. We compare the properties of the model with and without the time-delay feedback loop and find that it shows a preference for high-velocity objects. Extensive experiments suggest that the feedback STMD achieves superior detection performance for fast-moving small targets, while significantly suppressing background false positive movements which display lower velocities. The proposed feedback model provides an effective solution in robotic visual systems for detecting fast-moving small targets that are always salient and potentially threatening.	https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9486995	0
Secure Consensus of Multiagent Systems With DoS Attacks via Fully Distributed Dynamic Event-Triggered Control	This article investigates the secure consensus problem of general linear multiagent systems with denial-of-service (DoS) attacks. Owning to the existence of DoS attacks, it is challenging to investigate the event-triggered control of multiagent systems in a fully distributed manner. This article presents a novel dynamic event-triggered mechanism to alleviate the limited communication resources. Moreover, the designed mechanism is fully distributed and scalable owing to the introduction of some adaptive coupling weights. Since the DoS attacks have been considered in the event-triggered rule design, a novel adaptive parameter with an additional exponential term is adopted to deal with DoS attacks. The Lyapunov design also introduces such a term for the subsequent stability analysis. Sufficient conditions guaranteeing the asymptotic consensus of the studied system are developed in light of the controller’s parameters, duration, and frequency of the DoS attacks. Strict proof is provided to demonstrate that a secure consensus can be reached effectively under the proposed control mechanism. Furthermore, it is shown that the Zeno behavior can be excluded from the designed triggering mechanism. Finally, simulations on a multiagent system consisting of interconnected unmanned intelligent vehicles are conducted to verify the results.	https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=10159674	0
Perceptual Interaction-Based Path Tracking Control of Autonomous Vehicles Under DoS Attacks: A Reinforcement Learning Approach	This paper considers the distributed optimal path tracking control problem of autonomous ground vehicles (AGVs) with matched uncertainties under denial-of-service (DoS) attacks. First, to solve the uncertain system parameters, an inverse reinforcement learning (RL) technique is PROPOSED to seek the optimal controller instead of directly solving the robust control problem, which can ensure that the designed controller is globally optimal with respect to the proposal performance function. An off-policy RL algorithm is further proposed to learn the optimal control solution online without requiring any knowledge of the vehicle dynamics. Then, to lower the communication load among vehicles, a perception-based optimal resilient controller and its corresponding perception-based static deadband condition are developed, respectively. Moreover, the perception-based dynamic deadband control mechanism is further exploited to consider the secure path tracking control problem. The proposed algorithms verify that the RL-based optimal path tracking control can be solved, and the occurrence of the Zeno phenomenon can be avoided. Finally, a numerical simulation is demonstrated to verify the effectiveness of the proposed approach.	https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=10155261	0
Ultra-Reliable Device-Centric Uplink Communications in Airborne Networks: A Spatiotemporal Analysis	This article proposes an ultra-reliable device-centric uplink (URDC-UL) communication scheme for airborne networks. In particular, base stations (BSs) are mounted on unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) that travel to schedule UL transmissions and collect data from devices. To attain an ultra-reliable unified device-centric performance, the UL connection is established when the UAV-BS is hovering at the nearest possible distance from the scheduled device. The performance of the proposed URDC-UL scheme is benchmarked against a stationary UAV-centric uplink (SUC-UL) scheme where the devices are scheduled to communicate to UAV-BSs that are continuously hovering at static locations. Utilizing stochastic geometry and queueing theory, novel spatiotemporal mathematical models are developed, which account for the UAV-BS spatial densities, mobility, altitude, antenna directivity, ground-to-air channel, and temporal traffic, among other factors. The results demonstrate the sensitivity of the URDC-UL scheme to the ratio between hovering and traveling time. In particular, the hovering to traveling time ratio should be carefully adjusted to maximize the harvested performance gains for the URDC-UL scheme in terms of link reliability, transmission rate, energy efficiency, and delay. Exploiting the URDC-UL scheme allows IoT devices to minimize transmission power while maintaining unified reliable transmission. This preserves the device's battery and addresses a critical IoT design challenge.	https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=10057032	0
AST-SafeSec: Adaptive Stress Testing for Safety and Security Co-Analysis of Cyber-Physical Systems	Cyber-physical systems are becoming more intelligent with the adoption of heterogeneous sensor networks and machine learning capabilities that deal with an increasing amount of input data. While this complexity aims to solve problems in various domains, it adds new challenges for the system assurance. One issue is the rise in the number of abnormal behaviors that affect system performance due to possible sensor faults and attacks. The combination of safety risks, which are usually caused by random sensor faults and security risks that can happen during any random system state, makes the full coverage testing of the cyber-physical system challenging. Existing techniques are inadequate to deal with complex safety and security co-risks against cyber-physical systems. In this paper, we propose AST-SafeSec, an analysis methodology for both safety and security aspects that utilizes reinforcement learning to identify the most likely adversarial paths at various normal or failure states of a cyber-physical system that can influence system behavior through its sensor data. The methodology is evaluated using an autonomous vehicle scenario by incorporating a security attack into the stochastic sensor elements of a vehicle. Evaluation results show that the methodology analyzes the interaction of malicious attacks with random faults and identifies the incident caused by the interactions and the most likely path that leads to the incident.	https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=10231138	0
Wheel-INS2: Multiple MEMS IMU-Based Dead Reckoning System With Different Configurations for Wheeled Robots	A reliable self-contained navigation system is essential for autonomous vehicles. Based on our previous study on Wheel-INS [1], a wheel-mounted inertial measurement unit (Wheel-IMU)-based dead reckoning (DR) system, in this paper, we propose a multiple IMUs-based DR solution for the wheeled robots. The IMUs are mounted at different places on the wheeled vehicles to acquire various dynamic information. In particular, at least one IMU has to be mounted at the wheel to measure the wheel velocity and take advantage of the rotation modulation. The system is implemented through a distributed extended Kalman filter structure where each subsystem (corresponding to each IMU) retains and updates its own states separately. The relative position constraints between the multiple IMUs are exploited to further limit the error drift and improve the system’s robustness. Particularly, we present the DR systems using dual Wheel-IMUs, one Wheel-IMU plus one vehicle body-mounted IMU (Body-IMU), and dual Wheel-IMUs plus one Body-IMU as examples for analysis and comparison. Field tests illustrate that the proposed multi-IMU DR system outperforms the single Wheel-INS in terms of both positioning and heading accuracy. By comparing with the centralized filter, the proposed distributed filter shows unimportant accuracy degradation while holding significant computation efficiency. Moreover, among the three multi-IMU configurations, the one Body-IMU plus one Wheel-IMU design obtains the minimum drift rate. The position drift rates of the three configurations are 0.82% (dual Wheel-IMUs), 0.69% (one Body-IMU plus one Wheel-IMU), and 0.73% (dual Wheel-IMUs plus one Body-IMU), respectively.	https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9950438	0
Towards UAV-Based MEC Service Chain Resilience Evaluation: A Quantitative Modeling Approach	Unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) and network function virtualization (NFV) facilitate the deployment of multi-access edge computing (MEC). In the UAV-based MEC (UMEC) network, virtualized network function (VNF) can be implemented as a lightweight container running on UMEC host operating system (OS). However, UMEC network is vulnerable to attack, which can result in resource degradation and even UMEC service disruption. Rejuvenation techniques, such as failover technique and live container migration technique, can mitigate the impact of resource degradation but their effectiveness to improve the resilience of UMEC services should be evaluated. This paper presents a quantitative modeling approach based on semi-Markov process to investigate the resilience of a UMEC service chain consisting of any number of VNFs executed in any number of UMEC hosts in terms of availability and reliability. Unlike existing studies, the semi-Markov model constructed in this paper can capture the time-dependent behaviors between VNFs, between host OSes, and between VNFs and host OSes on the condition that the holding times of the recovery and failure events follow any kind of distribution. We perform the sensitivity analysis to identify potential resilience bottlenecks. The results highlight that migration time is the parameter significantly affecting the resilience, which shed the insight on designing the UMEC service chain with high-grade resilience requirements. In addition, we carry out the numerical experiments to reveal that: (i) the type of failure time distribution has a significant effect on the resilience; and (ii) the resilience increases with decreasing number of VNFs, while the availability increases with increasing number of UMEC hosts and the reliability decreases with increasing number of UMEC hosts, which can provide meaningful guidance for the UAV placement optimization in the UMEC network.	https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=10039493	0
Secure Cooperative Path Following of Autonomous Surface Vehicles Under Cyber and Physical Attacks	This paper is concerned with the networked cooperative path following (CPF) problem for multiple autonomous surface vehicles (ASVs) subject to simultaneous cyber and physical attacks. First, to compensate the adverse effects of the physical-attack-induced bias injections, an extended state observer is designed to provide real-time estimates of the unmeasured velocities and unknown nonlinear terms. Next, to identify and handle various cyber attacks, a novel secure data transmission mechanism, featuring a secure transmitter and a secure receiver, is developed for each ASV. Then, a secure CPF control scheme, consisting of a networked cooperative kinematic control law and a networked kinetic control law, is presented. Furthermore, the observer error dynamics and networked CPF error dynamics are derived to account for the simultaneous network-induced delays, packet dropouts, physical attacks, and cyber attacks. The proposed control scheme is capable to preserve satisfactory secure tracking performance of the resulting CPF control system under a desired reference path even in the presence of external environmental disturbances, delays, packet dropouts, and malicious attacks. Finally, several case studies are provided to substantiate the effectiveness of the secure CPF control scheme.	https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=10108032	0
Detecting UAV Presence Using Convolution Feature Vectors in Light Gradient Boosting Machine	The growing number of Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) applications brings with it, a rising number of privacy concerns. The high availability of commercial drones is also increasing the need for strict regulations. As far away as we are from establishing such protocols to ensure that the most basic human right to privacy is not exploited, we are further away from enforcing them. Thus, there is a need for a generalised drone detection system to detect different drones operating in a broad range of Radio Frequencies (RF). Previous attempts to tackle this problem have been made using audio, video, radar, WiFi and RF signals. While all these methods have their own benefits and drawbacks, RF has various characteristics which make them suitable for practical applications on a large scale. In this paper, we propose a novel technique called the ConvLGBM model which combines the feature extraction capability of a Convolution Neural Network (CNN) with the high classification accuracy of the Light Gradient Boosting Machine (LightGBM). We develop and evaluate the classifications done by an optimal CNN and the LightGBM model and then compare both models with the ConvLGBM.	https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9971793	0
Resilient Control for Multiagent Systems With a Sampled-Data Model Against DoS Attacks	To reduce the computational burden and resist the denial-of-service (DoS) attacks, a resilient distributed sampled-data control scheme is proposed for multiagent systems. The agent states are sampled periodically by the sensors. DoS attacks disrupt the data communication from transmitters to controllers randomly or periodically with a limited duration time. Information on DoS attacks can be obtained by introducing novel logic processors embedded in corresponding controllers. Next, the problem of resilient control can be converted into one concerned with the upper and lower bound of the sampling interval of an aperiodic sampled-data control system. Some sufficient criteria for developing resilient distributed controllers are derived using the novel looped Lyapunov functional approach and the free-matrix-based inequality method. Finally, two illustrative examples, unmanned aerial vehicles and the two-mass-spring systems, are provided to demonstrate the efficiency of the proposed resilient distributed sampled-data control protocols against the DoS attacks.	https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9751412	0
FDCT: Fast Depth Completion for Transparent Objects	Depth completion is crucial for many robotic tasks such as autonomous driving, 3-D reconstruction, and manipulation. Despite the significant progress, existing methods remain computationally intensive and often fail to meet the real-time requirements of low-power robotic platforms. Additionally, most methods are designed for opaque objects and struggle with transparent objects due to the special properties of reflection and refraction. To address these challenges, we propose a Fast Depth Completion framework for Transparent objects (FDCT), which also benefits downstream tasks like object pose estimation. To leverage local information and avoid overfitting issues when integrating it with global information, we design a new fusion branch and shortcuts to exploit low-level features and a loss function to suppress overfitting. This results in an accurate and user-friendly depth rectification framework which can recover dense depth estimation from RGB-D images alone. Extensive experiments demonstrate that FDCT can run about 70 FPS with a higher accuracy than the state-of-the-art methods. We also demonstrate that FDCT can improve pose estimation in object grasping tasks.	https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=10198256	0
A Comparative Analysis of Deadlock Avoidance and Prevention Algorithms for Resource Provisioning in Intelligent Autonomous Transport Systems Over 6G Infrastructure	6G is the future of intelligent connectivity artefacts with Artificial Intelligence (AI) at its backbone. The Multi-Access Edge Computing (MEC) based 6G enabled infrastructure helps in achieving the required zero latency for autonomous Intelligent Transport Systems (ITS) with features of low power consumption, lower end-to-end latency, minimal processing/transmission overheads, higher throughput and reliability. MEC are prone to a deadlock due to the limited amount of available computational resources, resulting in fatal delays in Vehicle-to-Vehicle (V2V), Vehicles to Road Side Unit (RSU) and RSU to ITS communication. The unresolved deadlock may entail higher energy consumption that can adversely affect the Quality of Service (QoS) in terms of safety and reliability with potential threats of causing fatal accidents. Therefore, it is almost imperative to resolve the deadlocks from MEC to comply with the QoS parameters of MEC based autonomous vehicles. The asserted goals can be achieved by employing an intelligent and adaptive deadlock resolution strategy. In this paper, a deadlock-aware, and collaborative edge decision algorithm has been proposed for facilitating the seamless communication of autonomous vehicles over MEC. Additionally, deadlock avoidance and prevention schemes have been evaluated using Bankers resource request avoidance algorithm, wound wait algorithm and wait-die algorithms for resource provisioning in collaborative MEC. Furthermore, the effectiveness of deadlock avoidance and prevention algorithms in real-time scenarios has been analyzed in MEC systems. The metrics used for a comparative analysis in this research include Round-trip time, Queue wait-time and CPU utilization. The proposed algorithm shows promising results when compared with prevalent techniques.	https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9777253	0
Power Allocation for Uplink Communications of Massive Cellular-Connected UAVs	Cellular-connected unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) has attracted a surge of research interest in both academia and industry. To support aerial user equipment (UEs) in the existing cellular networks, one promising approach is to assign a portion of the system bandwidth exclusively to the UAV-UEs. This is especially favorable for use cases where a large number of UAV-UEs are exploited, e.g., for package delivery close to a warehouse. Although the nearly line-of-sight (LoS) channels can result in higher powers received, UAVs can in turn cause severe interference to each other in the same frequency band. In this contribution, we focus on the uplink communications of massive cellular-connected UAVs. Different power allocation algorithms are proposed to either maximize the minimal spectrum efficiency (SE) or maximize the overall SE to cope with the severe interference based on the successive convex approximation (SCA) principle. One of the challenges is that a UAV can affect a large area meaning that many more UAV-UEs must be considered in the optimization problem, which is essentially different from that for terrestrial UEs. The necessity of single-carrier uplink transmission further complicates the problem. Nevertheless, we find that the special property of large coherent bandwidths and coherent times of the propagation channels can be leveraged. The performances of the proposed algorithms are evaluated via extensive simulations in the full-buffer transmission mode and bursty-traffic mode. Results show that the proposed algorithms can effectively enhance the uplink SEs. This work can be considered the first attempt to deal with the interference among massive cellular-connected UAV-UEs with optimized power allocations.	https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=10043743	0
Dynamic Path Planning Algorithm for Unmanned Surface Vehicle Under Island–Reef Environment	The marine environment surrounding islands and reefs exhibit significant time-varying characteristics, which require the path planning algorithm of an unmanned surface vehicle (USV) to have good environmental adaptability. To this end, a dynamic path planning algorithm for USV under an island–reef environment is proposed. The algorithm fully considers these environmental features, such as ocean currents, tides, and winds, to construct an environment model. The environment model is combined with the USV motion model to construct a path planning model under the constraint of environmental disturbance time windows. This approach ensures that the path planning model can adapt to the time-varying marine environment. At the same time, to improve the safety of USV navigation by effectively predicting and timely avoiding passing ships, the velocity obstacle method is introduced for establishing a collision risk assessment model that detects the threat level of passing ships in the vicinity of the USV. Based on the decision-making basis generated by the model, a path replanning model is constructed under the constraint of collision detection time windows. This improves the dynamic collision avoidance capability of the path replanning model. Furthermore, to speed up the solution speed and accuracy of the path planning model and the path replanning model, the multiobjective particle swarm optimization algorithm is improved in three aspects: particle coding method, particle update strategy, and external archive maintenance mechanism. Simulation results show that the algorithm can enable USV to safely avoid multiple close-range dynamic obstacles under maritime rules, while also demonstrating a high level of adaptability to the time-varying marine environment.	https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=10163065	0
Motion Estimation and Compensation in Automotive MIMO SAR	With the advent of self-driving vehicles, autonomous driving systems will have to rely on a vast number of heterogeneous sensors to perform dynamic perception of the surrounding environment. Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) systems increase the resolution of conventional mass-market radars by exploiting the vehicle’s ego-motion, requiring very accurate knowledge of the trajectory, usually not compatible with automotive-grade navigation systems. In this setting, radar data are typically used to refine the navigation-based trajectory estimation with so-called autofocus algorithms. Although widely used in remote sensing applications, where the timeliness of the imaging is not an issue, autofocus in automotive scenarios calls for simple yet effective processing options to enable real-time environment imaging. This paper aims at providing a comprehensive theoretical and experimental analysis of the autofocus requirements in typical automotive scenarios. We analytically derive the effects of navigation-induced trajectory estimation errors on SAR imaging, in terms of defocusing and wrong targets’ localization. Then, we propose a motion estimation and compensation workflow tailored to automotive applications, leveraging a set of stationary Ground Control Points (GCPs) in the low-resolution radar images (before SAR focusing). We theoretically discuss the impact of the GCPs position and focusing height on SAR imaging, highlighting common pitfalls and possible countermeasures. Finally, we show the effectiveness of the proposed technique employing experimental data gathered during open road campaign by a 77 GHz multiple-input multiple-output radar mounted in a forward-looking configuration.	https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9945666	0
ETD: An Efficient Time Delay Attack Detection Framework for UAV Networks	In recent years, Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) networks are widely used in both military and civilian scenarios. However, due to the distributed nature, they are also vulnerable to threats from adversaries. Time delay attack is a type of internal attack which maliciously delays the transmission of data packets and further causes great damage to UAV networks. Furthermore, it is easy to implement and difficult to detect due to the avoidance of packet modification and the unique characteristics of UAV networks. However, to the best of our knowledge, there is no research on time delay attack detection in UAV networks. In this paper, we propose an Efficient Time Delay Attack Detection Framework (ETD). First, we collect and select delay-related features from four different dimensions, namely delay, node, message and connection. Meanwhile, we utilize the pre-planned trajectory information to accurately calculate the real forwarding delay of nodes. Then, one-class classification is used to train the detection model, and the forwarding behaviors of all nodes can be evaluated, based on which their trust values can be obtained. Finally, the K-Means clustering method is used to distinguish malicious nodes from benign ones according to their trust values. Through extensive simulation, we demonstrate that ETD can achieve higher than 80% detection accuracy with less than 2.5% extra overhead in various settings of UAV networks and different routing protocols.	https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=10115020	0
Underwater Equipotential Line Tracking Based on Self-Attention Embedded Multiagent Reinforcement Learning Toward AUV-Based ITS	The rapid development of intelligent underwater devices promotes marine exploitation activities, including marine resource exploitation, marine target tracking, etc. This work will present how to utilize the Autonomous Underwater Vehicle (AUV) swarm or multi-AUVs system to track the underwater diffusion pollution, especially the equipotential line of particular concentration. Different from most of the current research, in this work, we take the AUV swam as a network system and utilize the Software-Defined Networking (SDN) technique to optimize the network architecture, constructing an SDN-enabled AUV network Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS). With the centralized management ability of the SDN technique, we propose the software-defined Centralized Training Decentralized Execution (CTDE) architecture based on the graph-based Soft Actor-Critic (SAC) algorithm to optimize the system control and management. To improve the computing and training efficiency, we embed the self-attention mechanism into the critic network construction, leading to a self-attention-based SAC algorithm. Evaluation results demonstrate that our proposed approach is able to exactly track the equipotential lines of a particular concentration in many categories (with different types of equipotential lines (including the shape, noise, and diffusion value)) of underwater diffusion fields. Meanwhile, our proposed approaches outperform some classical schemes in system awards, tracking errors, etc.	https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9874992	0
Gaussian Radar Transformer for Semantic Segmentation in Noisy Radar Data	Scene understanding is crucial for autonomous robots in dynamic environments for making future state predictions, avoiding collisions, and path planning. Camera and LiDAR perception made tremendous progress in recent years, but face limitations under adverse weather conditions. To leverage the full potential of multi-modal sensor suites, radar sensors are essential for safety critical tasks and are already installed in most new vehicles today. In this letter, we address the problem of semantic segmentation of moving objects in radar point clouds to enhance the perception of the environment with another sensor modality. Instead of aggregating multiple scans to densify the point clouds, we propose a novel approach based on the self-attention mechanism to accurately perform sparse, single-scan segmentation. Our approach, called Gaussian Radar Transformer, includes the newly introduced Gaussian transformer layer, which replaces the softmax normalization by a Gaussian function to decouple the contribution of individual points. To tackle the challenge of the transformer to capture long-range dependencies, we propose our attentive up- and downsampling modules to enlarge the receptive field and capture strong spatial relations. We compare our approach to other state-of-the-art methods on the RadarScenes data set and show superior segmentation quality in diverse environments, even without exploiting temporal information.	https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9968089	0
A Mathematical Modeling of Stuxnet-Style Autonomous Vehicle Malware	Autonomous vehicles (AVs) have the potential to provide new paradigms to enhance the safety, mobility, and environmental sustainability of surface transportation. However, as vehicles become more computerized and internally interconnected by electronic control systems, their vulnerability to cyber-attacks is a fast-growing concern and a national priority. Evidence from the Internet virus suggests that AVs will have critical challenges posed by epidemic-style malware like Stuxnet. This self-propagating malware is a fast and powerful way of disrupting the AV system and transportation infrastructure. This study presents a mathematical model for Stuxnet-style malware’s temporal and spatial spread. Taking cues from the field of epidemiology and ecology, the malware will be described as an infectious epidemic to capture the dynamics of temporal and spatial propagation behavior. This study is the first attempt to analyze the spread of Stuxnet-style malware on AVs. The future uses of such a model for the temporal-geographic spread of AVs-based infectious malware are discussed.	https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9998460	0
Deep Learning-Based Trajectory Planning and Control for Autonomous Ground Vehicle Parking Maneuver	In this paper, a novel integrated real-time trajectory planning and tracking control framework capable of dealing with autonomous ground vehicle (AGV) parking maneuver problems is presented. In the motion planning component, a newly-proposed idea of utilizing deep neural networks (DNNs) for approximating optimal parking trajectories is further extended by taking advantages of a recurrent network structure. The main aim is to fully exploit the inherent relationships between different vehicle states in the training process. Furthermore, two transfer learning strategies are applied such that the developed motion planner can be adapted to suit various AGVs. In order to follow the planned maneuver trajectory, an adaptive learning tracking control algorithm is designed and served as the motion controller. By adapting the network parameters, the stability of the proposed control scheme, along with the convergence of tracking errors, can be theoretically guaranteed. In order to validate the effectiveness and emphasize key features of our proposal, a number of experimental studies and comparative analysis were executed. The obtained results reveal that the proposed strategy can enable the AGV to fulfill the parking mission with enhanced motion planning and control performance. Note to Practitioners—This article was motivated by the problem of optimal automatic parking planning and tracking control for autonomous ground vehicles (AGVs) maneuvering in a restricted environment (e.g., constrained parking regions). A number of challenges may arise when dealing with this problem (e.g., the model uncertainties involved in the vehicle dynamics, system variable limits, and the presence of external disturbances). Existing approaches to address such a problem usually exploit the merit of optimization-based planning/control techniques such as model predictive control and dynamic programming in order for an optimal solution. However, two practical issues may require further considerations: 1). The nonlinear (re)optimization process tends to consume a large amount of computing power and it might not be affordable in real-time; 2). Existing motion planning and control algorithms might not be easily adapted to suit various types of AGVs. To overcome the aforementioned issues, we present an idea of utilizing the recurrent deep neural network (RDNN) for planning optimal parking maneuver trajectories and an adaptive learning NN-based (ALNN) control scheme for robust trajectory tracking. In addition, by introducing two transfer learning strategies, the proposed RDNN motion planner can be adapted to suit different AGVs. In our follow-up research, we will explore the possibility of extending the developed methodology for large-scale AGV parking systems collaboratively operating in a more complex cluttered environment.	https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9805687	0
Multi-UAV Cooperative Search Based on Reinforcement Learning With a Digital Twin Driven Training Framework	This paper considers the cooperative search for stationary targets by multiple unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) with limited sensing range and communication ability in a dynamic threatening environment. The main purpose is to use multiple UAVs to find more unknown targets as soon as possible, increase the coverage rate of the mission area, and more importantly, guide UAVs away from threats. However, traditional search methods are mostly unscalable and perform poorly in dynamic environments. A new multi-agent deep reinforcement learning (MADRL) method, DNQMIX, is proposed in this study to solve the multi-UAV cooperative target search (MCTS) problem. The reward function is also newly designed for the MCTS problem to guide UAVs to explore and exploit the environment information more efficiently. Moreover, this paper proposes a digital twin (DT) driven training framework “centralized training, decentralized execution, and continuous evolution” (CTDECE). It can facilitate the continuous evolution of MADRL models and solve the tradeoff between training speed and environment fidelity when MADRL is applied to real-world multi-UAV systems. Simulation results show that DNQMIX outperforms state-of-art methods in terms of search rate and coverage rate.	https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=10045049	0
Aerial Surveillance in Cities: When UAVs Take Public Transportation Vehicles	This paper considers using unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) to survey important sites across a city. When the sites are relatively far from the UAVs’ depot, the UAVs may not be able to reach many of the sites. Suppose that a UAV can take public transportation vehicles (PTVs) like a passenger. Then, it may reach a site that is unreachable by flying only. Based on this UAV-PTV scheme, we investigate a task-UAV assignment problem, which assigns a set of surveillance tasks to UAVs. We formulate a mixed-integer linear programming (MILP) problem that minimizes the overall energy consumption of UAVs, subject to that every site is surveyed by a certain number of UAVs during a given time window, and all UAVs successfully return to the depot. Considering that this problem is NP-hard, we present two sub-optimal solutions. The first solution orders the surveillance tasks according to the starting times of their time windows. Then, starting from the earliest one, it assigns the tasks one by one to UAVs. The second solution breaks the tasks into small non-overlapping groups. It then assigns tasks to UAVs group by group. The former solution quickly addresses the assignment problem, but it lacks the overall management of UAV resources. The latter improves this by assigning a group of tasks simultaneously, and it can control the computation complexity by limiting the group size. The comparison with the brute force method shows that the proposed solutions can achieve competitive performance in a reasonable time. Note to Practitioners—Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) have been widely used in surveillance missions. However, one challenge practitioners often meet is the limited flight duration. Commercial UAVs are in general powered by the onboard battery. Due to the restriction of payload, the battery capacity is constrained, which limits the UAVs’ operation time. In this paper, we present the approach exploiting public transportation vehicles (PTVs). In our design, a UAV can take a public transportation vehicles such as buses, trams and trains on the roof and transfer between vehicles when necessary. With this UAV-PTV collaboration scheme, we consider how to efficiently assign surveillance tasks to UAVs. Due to the NP-hardness of the considered problem, two suboptimal algorithms are presented.	https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9797309	0
DeepCar 5.0: Vehicle Make and Model Recognition Under Challenging Conditions	Inspired by multi-agent systems (MASs) and ensemble models, a novel method of vehicle make and model recognition (VMMR) based on a vehicle’s front-view images is presented in this paper. By exploiting the attention mechanism in this work, it is demonstrated that most of the features used for classifying a vehicle are extracted from its headlight, grill, scoop, and bumper sections. These areas are designated as the regions of interest (ROIs) in our approach. Contrary to the other methods in which a whole ROI is fed to a deep convolutional neural network, in this scheme, different ROIs are extracted from each image, and then a preprocessing block and a distinctive network are designed for each ROI, which is considered as a single agent. Each agent is then trained separately, and a vehicle’s type is determined with the collaboration of these agents and based on the blackboard classification system. Also, a new dataset (DeepCar 5.0) is compiled by using the data from the top 50 automakers. This dataset contains 40,185 images of the front views and the front three-quarters of vehicles in 480 different classes, and all the parts of dataset are labeled manually. The proposed technique is able to achieve the accuracies of 92.14 and 96.72% in the automated and the manual scenarios, respectively; and contrary to the current methods, it can perform flawless classification even when just a portion of a vehicle’s front view image is available for processing. The dataset and parts of the code are available at: https://github.com/DeepCar/DeepCar5.0.	https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9929284	0
A Survey on Safety-Critical Driving Scenario Generation—A Methodological Perspective	Autonomous driving systems have witnessed significant development during the past years thanks to the advance in machine learning-enabled sensing and decision-making algorithms. One critical challenge for their massive deployment in the real world is their safety evaluation. Most existing driving systems are still trained and evaluated on naturalistic scenarios collected from daily life or heuristically-generated adversarial ones. However, the large population of cars, in general, leads to an extremely low collision rate, indicating that safety-critical scenarios are rare in the collected real-world data. Thus, methods to artificially generate scenarios become crucial to measure the risk and reduce the cost. In this survey, we focus on the algorithms of safety-critical scenario generation in autonomous driving. We first provide a comprehensive taxonomy of existing algorithms by dividing them into three categories: data-driven generation, adversarial generation, and knowledge-based generation. Then, we discuss useful tools for scenario generation, including simulation platforms and packages. Finally, we extend our discussion to five main challenges of current works– fidelity, efficiency, diversity, transferability, controllability– and research opportunities lighted up by these challenges.	https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=10089194	0
LSTM-Based Distributed Conditional Generative Adversarial Network for Data-Driven 5G-Enabled Maritime UAV Communications	5G enabled maritime unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) communication is one of the important applications of 5G wireless network which requires minimum latency and higher reliability to support mission-critical applications. Therefore, lossless reliable communication with a high data rate is the key requirement in modern wireless communication systems. These all factors highly depend upon channel conditions. In this work, a channel model is proposed for air-to-surface link exploiting millimeter wave (mmWave) for 5G enabled maritime unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) communication. Firstly, we will present the formulated channel estimation method which directly aims to adopt channel state information (CSI) of mmWave from the channel model inculcated by UAV operating within the Long Short Term Memory (LSTM)-Distributed Conditional generative adversarial network (DCGAN) i.e. (LSTM-DCGAN) for each beamforming direction. Secondly, to enhance the applications for the proposed trained channel model for the spatial domain, we have designed an LSTM-DCGAN based UAV network, where each one will learn mmWave CSI for all the distributions. Lastly, we have categorized the most favorable LSTM-DCGAN training method and emanated certain conditions for our UAV network to increase the channel model learning rate. Simulation results have shown that the proposed LSTM-DCGAN based network is vigorous to the error generated through local training. A detailed comparison has been done with the other available state-of-the-art CGAN network architectures i.e. stand-alone CGAN (without CSI sharing), Simple CGAN (with CSI sharing), multi-discriminator CGAN, federated learning CGAN and DCGAN. Simulation results have shown that the proposed LSTM-DCGAN structure demonstrates higher accuracy during the learning process and attained more data rate for downlink transmission as compared to the previous state of artworks.	https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9830137	0
A Behavior Decision Method Based on Reinforcement Learning for Autonomous Driving	Autonomous driving vehicles can reduce congestion and improve safety while increasing traffic efficiency. To reflect the quality of driving more comprehensively, the driving safety, efficiency, and occupant comfort should be jointly optimized for autonomous vehicles. Furthermore, in order to cope with complicated traffic environments and achieve satisfactory driving performance, a powerful behavior decision-making module is indispensable for autonomous vehicles. Toward this end, we study a reinforcement-learning (RL)-based method to intelligently make the behavior decision in this article. A Markov decision process (MDP) model is first formulated with a comprehensive reward function, including the effects of driving safety, efficiency, and comfort. The knowledge of the surrounding vehicles is also leveraged to exploit the behavior prediction of the target vehicle. We then propose a behavior decision strategy based on the actor–critic (AC) mechanism, which can efficiently learn both a Gaussian policy function and a linear value function. Finally, the real traffic data are used to build up the simulations for evaluating the performances of the proposed method thoroughly. Simulation results show that our proposed method can significantly reduce the collision rate for autonomous vehicles.	https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9851435	0
Adversarial Attacks and Defenses Toward AI-Assisted UAV Infrastructure Inspection	Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) have been widely adopted to assist infrastructure inspection tasks, since they have shown their potential to benefit the inspection in terms of efficiency, cost, and safety. To improve the effectiveness of the inspection, there has been a growing focus of recent research in integrating AI techniques into UAV infrastructure inspection and has achieved promising results. However, no prior work has studied whether such integration will also introduce new security concerns, especially considering the existence of potential vulnerabilities in underlying AI models toward adversarial inputs. In this article, we perform the first study to fill this critical gap by identifying and validating the security vulnerabilities of AI models in the context of UAV infrastructure inspection with a focus on bridge infrastructure. To understand the security property of AI-assisted UAV bridge inspection, we design a two-stage approach for the construction of effective adversarial inputs, with which we successfully validate the existence of security vulnerability using dynamic analysis. Spatial constraints, physical limits, and dynamic environmental changes are taken into consideration in our analysis to make it practical in the physical world. Our evaluation results on a real-world data set show that our constructed adversarial inputs can mislead the UAV to miss detecting a significant amount of risk-prone regions by exploiting the identified vulnerability. Based on such an observation, this article also discusses the defenses based on adversarial training to improve the robustness of AI-assisted UAV bridge inspection, which has been demonstrated to be effective according to our experimental evaluation results.	https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9888765	0
Multi-UAV Trajectory Control, Resource Allocation, and NOMA User Pairing for Uplink Energy Minimization	In this work, we study the joint optimization of multiple unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs)’ trajectories, power allocation, user-UAV association, and user pairing for UAV-assisted wireless networks employing the nonorthogonal multiple access (NOMA) for uplink communications. The design aims to minimize the total energy consumption of ground users while guaranteeing to successfully transmit their required amount of data to the UAV-mounted base stations. The underlying problem is a mixed-integer nonlinear program (MINLP), which is difficult to solve optimally. To tackle this problem, we derive the optimal power allocation as a function of other variables, which is used to transform the optimization problem into an equivalent form. We then propose an iterative algorithm to solve the resulting optimization problem by using the block coordinate descent (BCD) method where three subproblems are solved in each iteration and this process is repeated until convergence. Specifically, given the UAVs’ trajectories and data rates, we solve the NOMA user pairing, and user-UAV association subproblem optimally by exploiting its special structure. Then, we describe how to optimize the users’ data rates and tackle the UAV trajectory optimization in the second and third subproblems, respectively, by using the successive convex approximation (SCA) method. Numerical results show that our proposed algorithm can provide efficient active-inactive schedules (by setting user’s transmit powers to zero), and lower energy consumption compared to an existing baseline, and an OMA-based resource allocation and UAV-trajectory optimization strategy.	https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9816078	0
A Secure Sensor Fusion Framework for Connected and Automated Vehicles Under Sensor Attacks	As typical applications of cyber–physical systems (CPSs), connected and automated vehicles (CAVs) are able to measure the surroundings and share local information with the other vehicles by using multimodal sensors and wireless networks. CAVs are expected to increase safety, efficiency, and capacity of our transportation systems. However, the increasing usage of sensors has also increased the vulnerability of CAVs to sensor faults and adversarial attacks. Anomalous sensor values resulting from malicious cyberattacks or faulty sensors may cause severe consequences or even fatalities. In this article, we increase the resilience of CAVs to faults and attacks by using multiple sensors for measuring the same physical variable to create redundancy. We exploit this redundancy and propose a sensor fusion algorithm for providing a robust estimate of the correct sensor information with bounded errors independent of the attack signals, and for attack detection and isolation. The proposed sensor fusion framework is applicable to a large class of security-critical CPSs. To minimize the performance degradation resulting from the usage of the estimation for control, we provide an  $H_{\infty }$  controller for cooperative adaptive cruise control-equipped CAVs. The designed controller is capable of stabilizing the closed-loop dynamics of each vehicle in the platoon while reducing the joint effect of estimation errors and communication channel noise on the tracking performance and string behavior of the vehicle platoon. Numerical examples are presented to illustrate the effectiveness of our methods.	https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9502914	0
Adversarial Attacks and Defenses for Deep-Learning-Based Unmanned Aerial Vehicles	The introduction of deep learning (DL) technology can improve the performance of cyber–physical systems (CPSs) in many ways. However, this also brings new security issues. To tackle these challenges, this article explores the vulnerabilities of DL-based unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), which are typical CPSs. Although many research works have been reported previously on adversarial attacks of DL models, only few of them are concerned about safety-critical CPSs, especially regression models in such systems. In this article, we analyze the problem of adversarial attacks against DL-based UAVs and propose two adversarial attack methods against regression models in UAVs. The experiments demonstrate that the proposed nontargeted and targeted attack methods both can craft imperceptible adversarial images and pose a considerable threat to the navigation and control of UAVs. To address this problem, adversarial training and defensive distillation methods are further investigated and evaluated, increasing the robustness of DL models in UAVs. To our knowledge, this is the first study on adversarial attacks and defenses against DL-based UAVs, which calls for more attention to the security and safety of such safety-critical applications.	https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9530723	0
Federated-Reinforcement-Learning-Enabled Joint Communication, Sensing, and Computing Resources Allocation in Connected Automated Vehicles Networks	For future connected automated vehicles (CAVs) networks, the joint optimization of communication, sensing, and computing resources is crucial to guarantee the performance of cooperative automated driving’s safety, which is attracting more and more attention. However, the existing works have not considered the low-latency requirement for the raw perception data sharing with both wireless communication link capability and computing efficiency constraints, causing a serious threat to the cooperative automated driving’s safety in CAVs networks. In this article, a vehicle–road–base station cooperation architecture is designed, and a federated reinforcement learning (FRL)-based task offloading and resource allocation algorithm in the CAVs network is proposed to reduce the task execution delay with different communication and computing constraints. The problem of execution delay minimization is theoretically formulated and analyzed under three task practical offloading modes. To adapt to the dynamic topology of the CAVs network, we design a deep reinforcement learning algorithm to achieve the optimal task offloading and resource allocation. To further reduce the data transmission overhead of the centralized reinforcement learning algorithm, the FRL-enabled algorithm is proposed to minimize the execution delay of the optimal task offloading and resource allocation among multiple CAVs. Both the simulation and hardware testbed results verify that the proposed algorithms can not only reduce the execution delay and the communication overhead but also improve the system throughput.	https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9815075	0
Joint Optimization of Deployment and Trajectory in UAV and IRS-Assisted IoT Data Collection System	Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) can be applied in many Internet of Things (IoT) systems, e.g., smart farms, as a data collection platform. However, the UAV-IoT wireless channels may be occasionally blocked by trees or high-rise buildings. An intelligent reflecting surface (IRS) can be applied to improve the wireless channel quality by smartly reflecting the signal via a large number of low-cost passive reflective elements. This article aims to minimize the energy consumption of the system by jointly optimizing the deployment and trajectory of the UAV. The problem is formulated as a mixed-integer-and-nonlinear programming (MINLP), which is challenging to address by the traditional solution, because the solution may easily fall into the local optimal. To address this issue, we propose a joint optimization framework of deployment and trajectory (JOLT), where an adaptive whale optimization algorithm (AWOA) is applied to optimize the deployment of the UAV, and an elastic ring self-organizing map (ERSOM) is introduced to optimize the trajectory of the UAV. Specifically, in AWOA, a variable-length population strategy is applied to find the optimal number of stop points, and a nonlinear parameter  $a$  and a partial mutation rule are introduced to balance the exploration and exploitation. In ERSOM, a competitive neural network is also introduced to learn the trajectory of the UAV by competitive learning, and a ring structure is presented to avoid the trajectory intersection. Extensive experiments are carried out to show the effectiveness of the proposed JOLT framework.	https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9802633	0
Computation Capacity Enhancement by Joint UAV and RIS Design in IoT	Mobile-edge computing (MEC) networks are facing limited coverage and harsh wireless transmission environments that severely hinder the computation capacity of the Internet-of-Things (IoT) devices. To overcome these issues, this article proposes a novel MEC framework empowered by an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) relay and a reconfigurable intelligence surface (RIS). To fully exploit the potentials in terms of computation enhancement brought by the joint UAV and RIS design, we formulate a max–min computation capacity problem via determining the uplink signal detection, active beamforming of UAV, passive beamforming of RIS, time slot partition, computation bits of UAV, and UAV’s trajectory. We develop a concave–convex procedure (CCCP)-based algorithm in an alternating optimization manner over three subproblems to solve the formulated problem. It finds that the CCCP-based algorithm is conducive to decouple the intractable expressions by converting them into new but tractable second-order cone (SOC) constrains. To evaluate the performance of the proposed CCCP-based algorithm, we later design a direct algorithm by exploiting the implicit convexity of the problem. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed CCCP-based algorithm derives a comparable performance as the direct algorithm, and achieves about 2.57-Mb max-min computation capacity higher compared with the straight flight case, and 8.08-Mb max–min computation capacity higher compared with the case without RIS, which validate the superiority of the joint UAV and RIS design for computation enhancement.	https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9785633	0
Context-Aware Multiagent Broad Reinforcement Learning for Mixed Pedestrian-Vehicle Adaptive Traffic Light Control	Efficient traffic light control is a critical part of realizing smart transportation. In particular, deep reinforcement learning (DRL) algorithms that use deep neural networks (DNNs) have superior autonomous decision-making ability. Most existing work has applied DRL to control traffic lights intelligently. In this article, we propose a novel context-aware multiagent broad reinforcement learning (CAMABRL) approach based on broad reinforcement learning (BRL) for mixed pedestrian-vehicle adaptive traffic light control (ATLC). CAMABRL exploits the broad learning system (BLS) established in a flat network structure to make decisions instead of a deep network structure. Unlike previous works that consider the attributes of vehicles, CAMABRL also takes the states of pedestrians waiting at the intersection into consideration. Combining with the context-aware mechanism that utilizes the states of adjacent agents and potential state information captured by the long short-term memory (LSTM) network, agents can make farsighted decisions to alleviate traffic congestion. The experimental results show that CAMABRL is superior to several state-of-the-art multiagent reinforcement learning (MARL) methods.	https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9756574	0
A Pairing-Free Heterogeneous Signcryption Scheme for Unmanned Aerial Vehicles	During the past few years, as Internet of Things develops rapidly, the applications of unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) technology have been increasingly widely used. Meanwhile, the efficiency and security issues of UAV communication have brought about widespread attention of many researchers in different fields. In an open wireless network, the attacks on UAV communication mainly include eavesdropping, tampering, interrupting, forgery, etc. Signcryption is an appropriate method to address these security problems. However, the existing signcryption schemes are not suitable for UAVs with limited resources and ground station (GS) that needs to process a large number of messages from UAVs. Moreover, in a certain area, UAVs and a GS may belong to different cryptosystems. Therefore, in this article, we came up with a heterogeneous signcryption scheme for UAVs to communicate to a GS (HSC-U2G) without bilinear pairing operation, where UAVs belong to identity-based cryptography (IBC) while the GS belongs to public-key infrastructure (PKI). Moreover, our scheme provides identity privacy for UAVs and supports batch verification for the GS. Using the random oracle model, we demonstrate HSC-U2G can achieve insider security for confidentiality as well as unforgeability. After that, HSC-U2G is compared with several important related works and we provide all experimental results to show the efficiency.	https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9762807	0
Multi-Agent Coordinated Close-in Jamming for Disabling a Rogue Drone	Drones, including remotely piloted aircraft or unmanned aerial vehicles, have become extremely appealing over the recent years, with a multitude of applications and usages. However, they can potentially present major threats for security and public safety, especially when they fly across critical infrastructures and public spaces. This work investigates a novel counter-drone solution by proposing a multi-agent framework in which a team of pursuer drones cooperate in order to track and jam a rogue drone. Within the proposed framework, a joint mobility and power control solution is developed to optimize the respective decisions of each cooperating agent in order to best track and intercept the moving rogue drone. Both centralized and distributed variants of the joint optimization problem are developed and extensive simulations are conducted to evaluate the performance of the problem variants and to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed solution.	https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9363641	0
Comprehensive Ocean Information-Enabled AUV Path Planning Via Reinforcement Learning	The path planning of the autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV) has shown great potential in various Internet of Underwater Things (IoUT) applications. Although considerable efforts had been made, prior studies are confronted with some limitations. For one thing, existing work only uses the ocean current simulation model without introducing real ocean information, having not been supported by real data. For another, traditional path planning algorithms have strong environment dependence and lack flexibility: once the environment changes, they need to be remodeled and replanned. To overcome these challenges, this article proposes comprehensive ocean information D3QN (COID), an AUV path planning scheme exploiting comprehensive ocean information and reinforcement learning (RL), which consists of three steps. First, we introduce the comprehensive real ocean data, including weather, temperature, thermohaline, current, etc., and apply them into the regional ocean modeling system to generated reliable ocean current. Next, through well-designed state transition function and reward function, we build a 3-D grid model of ocean environment for RL. Furthermore, based on the framework of the double dueling deep  $Q$  network (D3QN), COID integrates local ocean current and position features to provide state input and uses priority sampling to accelerate network convergence. The performance of COID has been evaluated and proved by numerical results, which demonstrate efficient path planning and high flexibility for expansion into different ocean environments.	https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9723442	0
Blockchain-Assisted Distributed and Lightweight Authentication Service for Industrial Unmanned Aerial Vehicles	Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) have shown great potential in benefiting industries due to their good features, such as the ease of deployment and low maintenance cost. However, the communication security issue remains a serious challenge before the large-scale application of industrial UAVs. The untrusted communication environment can cause the leakage of valuable industrial data or the losing of important cargos that carried by UAVs. Traditional authentication mechanisms for protecting communications include public-key infrastructure-based, ID-based, and certificateless authentication. These mechanisms rely on a central authority and some of them may introduce high-complexity computation that is not suitable for industrial drones. Therefore, aiming at these challenges, we design a blockchain-assisted distributed and lightweight authentication service for industrial UAVs. The blockchain technology supports the distributed and immutable storage of industrial UAVs’ authentication information, and smart contracts enable convenient operations for drones to acquire or update the corresponding information. Security evaluation demonstrates that our scheme is resistant to various attacks and can guarantee trustworthy communications for industrial drones. Extensive experiments also show that our designed authentication service can not only achieve low computation and communication cost for industrial UAVs but also remain robust even if a small proportion of drones are compromised.	https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9678341	0
Machine-Learning-Based 3-D Channel Modeling for U2V mmWave Communications	Unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) millimeter wave (mmWave) technologies can provide flexible link and high data rate for future communication networks. By considering the new features of three-dimensional (3-D) scattering space, 3-D velocity, 3-D antenna array, and especially 3-D rotations, a machine learning (ML)-integrated UAV-to-Vehicle (U2V) mmWave channel model is proposed. Meanwhile, an ML-based network for channel parameter calculation and generation is developed. The deterministic parameters are calculated based on the simplified geometry information, while the random ones are generated by the backpropagation-based neural network (BPNN) and generative adversarial network (GAN), where the training data set is obtained from massive ray-tracing (RT) simulations. Moreover, theoretical expressions of channel statistical properties, i.e., power delay profile (PDP), autocorrelation function (ACF), Doppler power spectrum density (DPSD), and cross-correlation function (CCF), are derived and analyzed. Finally, the U2V mmWave channel is generated under a typical urban scenario at 28 GHz. The generated PDP and DPSD show good agreement with RT-based results, which validates the effectiveness of proposed method. Moreover, the impact of 3-D rotations, which has rarely been reported in previous works, can be observed in the generated CCF and ACF, which are also consistent with the theoretical and measurement results.	https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9724219	0
BDTwin: An Integrated Framework for Enhancing Security and Privacy in Cybertwin-Driven Automotive Industrial Internet of Things	The rapid development of the automotive Industrial Internet of Things requires secure networking infrastructure toward digitalization. Cybertwin (CT) is a next-generation networking architecture that serves as a communication, and digital asset owner, and can make the Vehicle-to-Everything (V2X) network flexible and secure. However, CT itself can publish end users’ digital assets to other entities as a service, making data security and privacy major obstacles in the realization of V2X applications. Motivated from the aforementioned discussion, this article presents BDTwin, a blockchain and deep-learning-based integrated framework to enhance security and privacy in CT-driven V2X applications. Specifically, a blockchain scheme is designed to ensure secure communication among vehicles, roadside units, CT-edge server, and cloud server using a smart contract-based enhance-Proof-of-Work (ePoW) and Zero Knowledge Proof (ZKP)-based verification process. Smart contracts are used to enforce rules and regulations that govern the behavior of V2X entities in a nondeniable and automated manner. In a deep-learning scheme, an autoregressive-deep variational autoencoder model is combined with attention-based bidirectional long short-term memory (A-BLSTM) for automatic feature extraction and attack detection by analyzing CT-edge servers data in a V2X environment. Security analysis and experimental results using two different sources, ToN-IoT and CICIDS-2017 show the superiority of the proposed BDTwin framework over some baseline and recent state-of-the-art techniques.	https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9583667	0
Federated Learning With Fair Incentives and Robust Aggregation for UAV-Aided Crowdsensing	Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) combined with artificial intelligence (AI) have recently gathered significant interest to enable intelligent and on-demand crowdsensing applications. In conventional AI approaches, a wealth of UAVs’ sensory data (which may be privacy-sensitive) needs to be mitigated to the central storage for model training, which poses severe privacy and data misuse risks. The promising federated learning (FL) allows UAVs to cooperatively train a shared model while keeping the private raw data locally. However, FL imposes heavy communication loads on battery-limited UAVs owing to frequent local training and global synchronization. Due to the heterogeneity of UAVs and presence of free-riders and Byzantine UAVs, the quality of UAVs’ model updates can vary dramatically, raising great challenges for fair incentives and robust model aggregation. In this paper, we propose a novel fair and robust federated learning (FRFL) scheme in UAV-aided crowdsensing. Specifically, we first exploit edge computing-enabled 5G heterogeneous networks in the FL framework to offer proximal FL services with high data rate and low latency for UAVs. Then, based on contract theory, we design an optimal incentive mechanism to precisely and fairly encourage UAVs’ participation in FL under information asymmetry. The method is proved to be truthful, contractual feasible, and computationally efficient. Furthermore, we develop Byzantine-robust aggregation rules and fair model profit allocation rules via contribution index measurement. We also propose a reputation mechanism for credible UAVs recruitment and free-rider prevention by leveraging historical learning records and exploring record freshness for weight assignment. Simulation results validate the efficiency of FRFL in terms of user utility, communication efficiency, and robustness.	https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9664267	0
Fortifying Smart Transportation Security Through Public Blockchain	Smart vehicles-enabled intelligent transportation system (ITS) supports a wide range of applications, such as, but not limited to, traffic planning and management, collision avoidance alert system, automated road speed enforcement, electronic toll collection, and real-time parking management, to name a few. However, it suffers from various types of security and privacy issues due to insecure communication among the entities over public channels. Therefore, an efficient and lightweight security mechanism is essential to protect the data that is both at rest as well as in transit. To this direction, we propose a public blockchain-envisioned secure communication framework for ITS (PBSCF-ITS). The proposed PBSCF-ITS guarantees access control and key management among the vehicle to vehicle, vehicle to roadside unit, and roadside unit to cloud server. We analyze the security of PBSCF-ITS to prove its resilience against various types of possible attacks. Furthermore, the performance of PBSCF-ITS with other related competing schemes has been compared. The obtained results illustrate that PBSCF-ITS outperforms the existing ones. Additionally, the pragmatic study of PBSCF-ITS is conducted to check its influence on various network-related performance parameters, like the number of mined blocks and transactions per block.	https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9709886	0
Delay and Reliability-Constrained VNF Placement on Mobile and Volatile 5G Infrastructure	Ongoing research and industrial exploitation of SDN and NFV technologies promise higher flexibility on network automation and infrastructure optimization. Choosing the location of Virtual Network Functions is a central problem in the automation and optimization of the software-defined, virtualization-based next generation of networks such as 5G and beyond. Network services provided for autonomous vehicles, factory automation, e-health and cloud robotics often require strict delay bounds and reliability constraints influenced by the location of its composing Virtual Network Functions. Robots, vehicles and other end-devices provide significant capabilities such as actuators, sensors and local computation which are essential for some services. Moreover, these devices are continuously on the move and might lose network connection or run out of battery, which further challenge service delivery in this dynamic environment. This work tackles the mobility, and battery restrictions; as well as the temporal aspects and conflicting traits of reliable, low latency service deployment over a volatile network, where mobile compute nodes act as an extension of the cloud and edge computing infrastructure. The problem is formulated as a cost-minimizing Virtual Network Function placement optimization and an efficient heuristic is proposed. The algorithms are extensively evaluated from various aspects by simulation on detailed real-world scenarios.	https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9339982	0
SARDO: An Automated Search-and-Rescue Drone-Based Solution for Victims Localization	Natural disasters affect millions of people every year. Finding missing persons in the shortest possible time is of crucial importance to reduce the death toll. This task is especially challenging when victims are sparsely distributed in large and/or difficult-to-reach areas and cellular networks are down. In this paper we present SARDO, a drone-based search and rescue solution that leverages the high penetration rate of mobile phones in the society to localize missing people. SARDO is an autonomous, all-in-one drone-based mobile network solution that does not require infrastructure support or mobile phones modifications. It builds on novel concepts such as pseudo-trilateration combined with machine-learning techniques to efficiently locate mobile phones in a given area. Our results, with a prototype implementation in a field-[1], show that SARDO rapidly determines the location of mobile phones ($\sim \!3$∼3 min/UE) in a given area with an accuracy of few tens of meters and at a low battery consumption cost ($\sim \!5\%$∼5%). State-of-the-art localization solutions for disaster scenarios rely either on mobile infrastructure support or exploit onboard cameras for human/computer vision, IR, thermal-based localization. To the best of our knowledge, SARDO is the first drone-based cellular search-and-rescue solution able to accurately localize missing victims through mobile phones.	https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9321707	0
Beamforming Design and Performance Analysis for Satellite and UAV Integrated Networks in IoRT Applications	Satellite and unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) integrated networks (SUINs) are considered as a promising method to offer various Internet of Remote Things (IoRT) applications. In this article, we investigate the downlink transmission of SUINs where the satellite-to-UAV link uses the free-space optical (FSO) technology with an equal gain combining (EGC) scheme while the links from UAV to IoRT devices exploit radio frequency (RF) with the space-division multiple access (SDMA) technique. Specifically, considering that only statistical channel state information (CSI) is available, we first formulate an optimization problem to maximize the ergodic sum rate (ESR) of the system, which is constrained by the total transmit power budget and IoRT devices’ rate requirements. Then, a beamforming (BF) scheme based on the alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM) is proposed to solve the nonconvex problem. Furthermore, a zero-forcing (ZF)-based suboptimal approach is also presented to reduce the implementation complexity. Finally, by assuming that the FSO link and RF links are subject to Gamma–Gamma fading and Nakagami- $m$  fading, respectively, we derive closed-form ESR expressions for the considered network with the proposed BF schemes. Simulation results are provided to confirm the accuracy of the theoretical analysis. Moreover, it is revealed that our proposed EGC scheme for FSO communication and BF schemes for RF transmission can both achieve better performance than the existing works.	https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9766223	0
Risk Adversarial Learning System for Connected and Autonomous Vehicle Charging	In this article, the design of a rational decision support system (RDSS) for a connected and autonomous vehicle charging infrastructure (CAV-CI) is studied. In the considered CAV-CI, the distribution system operator (DSO) deploys electric vehicle supply equipment (EVSE) to provide an electrical vehicle (EV) charging facility for human-driven connected vehicles (CVs) and AVs. The charging request by the human-driven EV becomes irrational when it demands more energy and charging period than its actual need. Therefore, the scheduling policy of each EVSE must be adaptively accumulated the irrational charging request to satisfy the charging demand of both CVs and autonomous vehicles (AVs). To tackle this, we formulate an RDSS problem for the DSO, where the objective is to maximize the charging capacity utilization by satisfying the laxity risk of the DSO. Thus, we devise a rational reward maximization problem to adapt the irrational behavior by CVs in a data-informed manner. We propose a novel risk adversarial multiagent learning system (RAMALS) for CAV-CI to solve the formulated RDSS problem. In RAMALS, the DSO acts as a centralized risk adversarial agent (RAA) for informing the laxity risk to each EVSE. Subsequently, each EVSE plays the role of a self-learner agent to adaptively schedule its own EV sessions by coping advice from RAA. The experiment results show that the proposed RAMALS affords around 46.6% improvement in charging rate, about 28.6% improvement in the EVSE’s active charging time, and at least 33.3% more energy utilization, as compared to a currently deployed ACN EVSE system, and other baselines.	https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9703673	0
Dynamic-Detection-Based Trajectory Planning for Autonomous Underwater Vehicle to Collect Data From Underwater Sensors	Marine science and Internet of Underwater Things applications rely significantly on collecting data from underwater sensors. Data collection using long-distance underwater acoustic communications consumes a lot of energy in underwater sensor nodes, which are powered by batteries. To achieve low-energy consumption, we can use the autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV) to move close to sensor nodes and exploit the short-range and high-rate communications. Most of the existing AUV-based data collection schemes consider the scenarios having the knowledge of node positions, where the cruising trajectory can be computed before the AUV’s departure. These schemes cannot apply to some scenarios such as turtle tracking for a certain sea area having no position information. To this end, we first propose a planning-while-detecting approach to dynamically detect the sensors on turtles and adjust the AUV cruising direction to collect data. To further improve data efficiency under the energy limit of the AUV, we group the sensors that can share the same trajectory using their detected directions. A grouping-based dynamic trajectory planning (GDTP) is then proposed to determine the next cruising direction that can visit the group of sensors having the largest amount of data and demanding the least cruising energy at the risk of detection errors. Simulation results show that GDTP achieves significantly higher data collection efficiency than the existing trajectory planning algorithms in dynamic scenarios, and as the communication range increases, it can even outperform the existing algorithms with node locations.	https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9675831	0
Mitigating Traffic Remapping Attacks in Autonomous Multihop Wireless Networks	Multihop wireless networks with autonomous nodes are susceptible to selfish traffic remapping attacks (TRAs). Nodes launching TRAs leverage the underlying channel access function to receive an unduly high Quality of Service (QoS) for packet flows traversing source-to-destination routes. TRAs are easy to execute, impossible to prevent, difficult to detect, and harmful to the QoS of honest nodes. Recognizing the need for providing QoS security, we use a novel network-oriented QoS metric to propose a self-enforcing game-theoretic mitigation approach. By switching between TRA and honest behavior, selfish nodes engage in a noncooperative multistage game in pursuit of high QoS. We analyze feasible node strategies and design a distributed signaling mechanism called DISTRESS, under which, given certain conditions, the game produces a desirable outcome: after an upper bounded play time, honesty tends to become a selfish node’s best reply behavior, while yielding acceptable QoS to most or all nodes. We verify these findings by Monte Carlo and ns-3 simulations of static and mobile nodes.	https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9684538	0
Detection and Blind Channel Estimation for UAV-Aided Wireless Sensor Networks in Smart Cities Under Mobile Jamming Attack	Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) can be integrated into wireless sensor networks (WSNs) for smart city applications in several ways. Among them, a UAV can be employed as a relay in a “store-carry and forward” fashion by uploading data from ground sensors and metering devices and, then, downloading it to a central unit. However, both the uploading and downloading phases can be prone to potential threats and attacks. As a legacy from traditional wireless networks, the jamming attack is still one of the major and serious threats to UAV-aided communications, especially when also the jammer is mobile, e.g., it is mounted on a UAV or inside a terrestrial vehicle. In this article, we investigate anti-jamming communications for UAV-aided WSNs operating over doubly selective channels in the downloading phase. In such a scenario, the signals transmitted by the UAV and the malicious mobile jammer undergo both time dispersion due to multipath propagation effects and frequency dispersion caused by their mobility. To suppress high-power jamming signals, we propose a blind physical-layer technique that jointly detects the UAV and jammer symbols through serial disturbance cancelation based on symbol-level post-sorting of the detector output. Amplitudes, phases, time delays, and Doppler shifts—required to implement the proposed detection strategy—are blindly estimated from data through the use of algorithms that exploit the almost-cyclostationarity properties of the received signal and the detailed structure of multicarrier modulation format. Simulation results corroborate the anti-jamming capabilities of the proposed method, for different mobility scenarios of the jammer.	https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9634169	0
Wireless Information and Power Transfer for IoT: Pulse Position Modulation, Integrated Receiver, and Experimental Validation	Simultaneous wireless information and power transfer (SWIPT) has emerged as a viable technique to energize and connect low-power autonomous devices and enable future Internet of Things (IoT). A major challenge of SWIPT is the energy consumption of the receiver of such low-power devices. An attractive low-power solution consists of an integrated information decoder (ID) and energy harvester (EH) architecture for SWIPT receiver (IntRx) where the received radiofrequency (RF) signal is first rectified before being used for information decoding. Such architecture eliminates the need for energy-consuming RF components, such as local oscillators and mixers. This article proposes a novel modulation and demodulation method for the IntRx SWIPT architecture based on pulse position modulation (PPM) where information is encoded in the position of the pulse. The new method transmits high amplitude pulses to increase the peak-to-average power ratio (PAPR) of the transmit signal and exploits the EH’s nonlinearity so as to boost the harvested dc power. Simultaneously, the information can be decoded from the rectifier signal by simply finding the position of the pulse in a certain symbol duration. We have analyzed both the information and the power transfer performance of the newly proposed PPM for IntRx SWIPT theoretically, numerically, and experimentally. To that end, we have established a SWIPT system testbed in an indoor environment by prototyping a base station to transfer information-power signal and the IntRx SWIPT receiver, including ID and EH blocks. The performance evaluation of the PPM was carried out in various conditions, and the results have been compared and contrasted to conventional signals. Theoretical, numerical, and experimental results highlight the significant benefits of the proposed PPM scheme to enhance the power transfer performance and operate information decoding with low-power consumption.	https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9651541	0
Bift: A Blockchain-Based Federated Learning System for Connected and Autonomous Vehicles	Machine learning (ML) algorithms are essential components in autonomous driving. In most existing connected and autonomous vehicles (CAVs), a large amount of driving data collected from multiple vehicles are sent to a central server for unified training. However, data privacy and security have become crucial during the data-sharing process. Federated learning (FL) for data security has arisen nowadays, and it can improve the data privacy of distribute machine learning. However, the malicious attackers can still be able to attack the training process. Due to the complete reliance on the central server, FL is very fragile. To address the above problem, we propose Bift: 1) a fully decentralized ML system combined with FL and 2) blockchain to provide a privacy-preserving ML process for CAVs. Bift enables distributed CAVs to train ML models locally using their own driving data and then to upload the local models to get a better global model. More importantly, Bift provides a consensus algorithm named Proof of Federated Learning to resist possible adversaries. We evaluate the performance of Bift and demonstrate that Bift is scalable and robust, and can defend against malicious attacks.	https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9650783	0
Defense Against Machine Learning Based Attacks in Multi-UAV Networks: A Network Coding Based Approach	Thanks to the agility and mobility features, unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) have been applied for a wide range of civil and military missions. To remotely control and monitor UAVs, mission-related data such as location and trajectory information are transmitted over wireless channels. However, UAV networks are vulnerable to eavesdropping attacks due to: 1) the broadcasting nature of wireless channels; 2) the broad coverage in aerial environments. In this paper, we investigate the potential security threats in UAV networks with passive attackers who aim to eavesdrop and decode encrypted locations by using machine learning techniques. We show that a neural network of two hidden layers is able to decode the encrypted locations if using the existing location protection methods. To defend against such machine learning based attacks, we suggest a location protection approach based on the random linear network coding with encryption keys being randomly permuted. We prove that our proposed approach allows for a low attacker's success probability and provides untraceability property. Our simulation results indicate that our approach significantly outperforms the existing location protection methods in terms of attacker's bit error rate, even with a small number of UAVs.	https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9754235	0
FALCON: A Networked Drone System for Sensing, Localizing, and Approaching RF Targets	We present FALCON, a novel autonomous drone network system for sensing, localizing, and approaching RF targets/sources such as smartphone devices. Potential applications of our system include disaster relief missions in which networked drones sense the Wi-Fi signal emitted from a victim’s smartphone and dynamically navigate to accurately localize and quickly approach the victim, for instance, to deliver the time-critical first-aid kits. For that we exploit Wi-Fi’s recent fine time measurement (FTM) protocol to realize the first on-drone FTM sensor network that enables accurate and dynamic ranging of targets in a mission. We propose a flight planning strategy that adapts the trajectory of the drones to concurrently favor localizing and approaching the target. Namely, our approach jointly optimizes the drones’ diversity of observations and the target approaching process, while flexibly trading off the intensities of the potentially conflicting objectives. We implement FALCON via a custom-designed multidrone platform and demonstrate up to  $2\times $  localization accuracy compared to a baseline flocking approach, while spending 30% less time localizing targets.	https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9716067	0
Energy-Efficient and Secure Communication Toward UAV Networks	Wireless networks ensure the unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) communicate and cooperate with each other, which plays an indispensable role among UAVs. The two crucial challenges in UAV wireless networks are energy saving and security. The current lightweight communication approaches lead to insufficient robustness of the encrypted transmission that is insecure. To address this issue, we propose a secure transmission approach with energy efficiency toward UAVs networks. We design a lightweight symmetric encryption algorithm based on SM4 and the relevant key negotiation and update mechanism to protect the confidentiality of communication contents. Moreover, a modified aggregative BLS signature scheme, together with the Merkle Hash tree (MHT), is introduced to guarantee the integrity and authenticity of data packets in transmission. Furthermore, we propose an online/offline revocable identity-based group signature (OORIBGS) scheme and integrate it into our framework for UAV anonymity, traceability, as well as revocability with small key management cost and high efficiency. We give detailed security analysis and prove that our proposal has the properties of data confidentiality, integrity, and authenticity, as well as identity traceability and anonymity. Moreover, we apply our approach in the UAVs networks and evaluate the runtime and anti-attack performance. The experimental results show that the proposed method can be effectively used in UAVs secure communication.	https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9560132	0
A Lightweight and Privacy-Preserving Mutual Authentication and Key Agreement Protocol for Internet of Drones Environment	With accelerated advances in various technologies, drones, better known as unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), are increasingly commonplace and consequently have a more pronounced impact on society. For example, Internet of Drones (IoD), a new communication paradigm offering fundamental navigation assistance and access to information, has widespread applications ranging from agricultural drones in farming to surveillance drones in the COVID-19 pandemic. The increasingly prominent role of IoD in our society also reinforces the importance of securing such systems against various data privacy and security threats. Operationally, it can be challenging to adopt conventional off-the-shelf security products in an IoD system due to the underpinning characteristics of drones (e.g., dynamic and open communication channel). Therefore in this article, we propose a lightweight and privacy-preserving mutual authentication and key agreement protocol, hereafter referred to as PMAP. The latter uses a physical unclonable function (PUF) and chaotic system to support mutual authentication and establish a secure session key between communication entities in the IoD system. To be specific, PMAP consists of two schemes, namely: 1)  ${\mathrm{ PMAP}}^{D2Z}$  (that mutually authenticates drone and zone service provider (ZSP) and establishes secure session keys) and 2)  ${\mathrm{ PMAP}}^{D2D}$  (that mutually authenticates drones and establishes secure session keys). In addition, PMAP supports conditional privacy preserving so that the genuine identity of drones can only be revealed by trusted ZSPs. We evaluate the security of PMAP using automated validation of Internet security protocols and application (AVISPA), as well as provide formal and informal security analysis to show the resilience of PMAP against various security attacks. We also evaluate the performance of PMAP through extensive experiments and compare its performance with existing AKA and IBE-Lite schemes, whose findings show that PMAP achieves better performance in terms of computation cost, energy consumption, and communication overhead.	https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9745033	0
MD-GAN-Based UAV Trajectory and Power Optimization for Cognitive Covert Communications	This article investigates the covert performance of an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) jammer-assisted cognitive radio (CR) network. In particular, the covert transmission of secondary users can be effectively protected by UAV jamming against the eavesdropping. For practical consideration, the UAV is assumed to only know certain partial channel distribution information (CDI), whereas not to know the detection threshold of an eavesdropper. For this sake, we propose a model-driven generative adversarial network (MD-GAN)-assisted optimization framework, consisting of a generator and a discriminator, where the unknown channel information and the detection threshold are learned weights. Then, a GAN-based joint trajectory and power optimization (GAN-JTP) algorithm is developed to train the MD-GAN optimization framework for covert communication, which results in the joint solution of the UAV’s trajectory and transmits power to maximize the covert rate and the probability of detection errors. Our simulation results show that the proposed GAN-JTP with a rapid convergence speed can attain near-optimal solutions of the UAV’s trajectory and transmit power for the covert communication.	https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9584882	0
Autonomous Driving Security: State of the Art and Challenges	The autonomous driving industry has mushroomed over the past decade. Although autonomous driving has undoubtedly become one of the most promising technologies of this century, its development faces multiple challenges, of which security is the major concern. In this article, we present a thorough analysis of autonomous driving security. First, the attack surface of autonomous driving is presented. After an analysis of the operation of autonomous driving in terms of key components and technologies, the security of autonomous driving is elaborated in four dimensions: 1) sensors; 2) operating system; 3) control system; and 4) vehicle-to-everything (V2X) communication. Sensor security is examined from five components, which are mainly responsible for self-positioning and environmental perception. The analysis of operating system security, the second dimension, is concentrated on the robot operating system. Concerning the control system security, the controller area network is approached mainly from vulnerabilities and protection measures. The fourth dimension, V2X communication security, is probed from four categories of attacks: 1) authenticity/identification; 2) availability; 3) data integrity; and 4) confidentiality with corresponding solutions. Moreover, the drawbacks of existing methods adopted in the four dimensions are also provided. Finally, a conceptual multilayer defense framework is proposed to secure the information flow from external communication to the physical autonomous vehicle.	https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9625017	0
Temporal Pyramid Network With Spatial-Temporal Attention for Pedestrian Trajectory Prediction	Understanding and predicting human motion behavior with social interactions have become an increasingly crucial problem for a vast number of applications, ranging from visual navigation of autonomous vehicles to activity prediction of intelligent video surveillance. Accurately forecasting crowd motion behavior is challenging due to the multimodal nature of trajectories and complex social interactions between humans. Recent algorithms model and predict the trajectory with a single resolution, making them difficult to exploit the long-range information and the short-range information of the motion behavior simultaneously. In this paper, we propose a temporal pyramid network for pedestrian trajectory prediction through a squeeze modulation and a dilation modulation. The hierarchical design of our framework allows to model the trajectory with multi-resolution, then can better capture the motion behavior at various tempos. By progressively combining the global context with the local one, we finally construct a coarse-to-fine hierarchical pedestrian trajectory prediction framework with multi-supervision. Further, we introduce a unified spatial-temporal attention mechanism to adaptively select important information of persons around in both spatial and temporal domains. We show that our attention strategy is intuitive and effective to encode the influence of social interactions. Experimental results on two benchmarks demonstrate the superiority of our proposed scheme.	https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9373939	0
Multi-UAV Cooperative Localization for Marine Targets Based on Weighted Subspace Fitting in SAGIN Environment	As an indispensable part of the Internet of Vehicles (IoV), unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) can be deployed for target positioning and navigation in the space–air–ground-integrated network (SAGIN) environment. Maritime target positioning is very important for the safe navigation of ships, hydrographic surveys, and marine resource exploration. Traditional methods typically exploit satellites to locate marine targets in the SAGIN environment, and the location accuracy does not satisfy the requirements of modern ocean observation missions. In order to localize the marine target, we develop a system architecture in this article, which contains UAVs integrated with monostatic multiple-input–multiple-output (MIMO) radars. The main thrust is to estimate the direction-of-arrival (DOA) via MIMO radar. Herein, we consider a general scenario that unknown mutual coupling exist and a novel sparse reconstruction algorithm is proposed. The mutual coupling matrix (MCM) is adopted with the help of its special structure, we formulate the data model as a sparse representation form. Then, two novel matrices, a weighted matrix, and a reduced-dimensional matrix are constructed to reduce the computational complexity and enhance the sparsity, respectively. Thereafter, a sparse constraint model is constructed using the concept of optimal weighted subspace fitting (WSF). Finally, the DOA estimation of maritime targets can be achieved by reconstructing the support of a block sparse matrix. Based on the DOA estimation results, multiple UAVs are used to cross-locate marine targets multiple times, and an accurate marine target position is achieved in the SAGIN environment. Numerical results are carried out, which demonstrates the effectiveness of the proposed DOA estimator, and the multi-UAV cooperative localization system can realize accurate target localization.	https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9380358	0
Blockchain-Based Cross-Domain Authentication for Intelligent 5G-Enabled Internet of Drones	While 5G can facilitate high-speed Internet access and make over-the-horizon control a reality for unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs; also known as drones), there are also potential security and privacy considerations, for example, authentication among drones. Centralized authentication approaches not only suffer from a single point of failure but they are also incapable of cross-domain authentication. This complicates the cooperation of drones from different domains. To address these limitations, a blockchain-based cross-domain authentication scheme for intelligent 5G-enabled Internet of drones is proposed in this article. Our approach employs multiple signatures based on threshold sharing to build an identity federation for collaborative domains. This allows us to support domain joining and exiting. Reliable communication between cross-domain devices is achieved by utilizing smart contract for authentication. The session keys are negotiated to secure subsequent communication between two parties. Our security and performance evaluations show that the proposed scheme is resistant to common attacks targeting Internet of Things (IoT) devices (including drones), as well as demonstrating its effectiveness and efficiency.	https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9540762	0
RTT-Based Rogue UAV Detection in IoV Networks	Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) are being used in different emerging domains for accomplishing many critical tasks. However, due to the various constraints, such as battery life, computational resources, etc., a UAV under a mission (M-UAV) often needs assistance from an edge/cloud server that is reachable from the M-UAV’s location. A connection between an M-UAV and edge server can be established via an access point or AP. Therefore, before sharing any sensitive information with the edge server, it is essential for an M-UAV to determine the legitimacy of the selected AP. Recently, some works in this direction indicate that a rogue UAV (R-UAV) can successfully mimic a legitimate AP for intercepting the communication channel. Hence, there should be a robust detection mechanism in place for addressing such a threat scenario. In this article, considering one of the emerging domains—the Internet of Vehicle (IoV) networks, at first, we show that communication in the IoV networks can get benefit from the presence of M-UAVs. However, as the link between the M-UAV and edge server can be intercepted by an R-UAV, the adversary may access the sensitive information from the IoV networks. Followed by this, we propose a timing-based algorithm for identifying the presence of rogue APs (or R-UAVs) in the channel. The M-UAV executes the timing-based algorithm, and the detection method does not require any auxiliary hardware or any modification to the network protocols for meeting the objective. Supported by an extensive evaluation study, we show that without any rigid restriction on the M-UAV’s speed (e.g., by limiting it to almost static) the proposed approach significantly enhances the detection accuracy (at least by a margin of 29.7% and 16.65%) compared to the state-of-the-art methods.	https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9321353	0
Robust Fuzzy Learning for Partially Overlapping Channels Allocation in UAV Communication Networks	With significantly dynamic characteristics of the new aerial users, the emerging cellular-enabled unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) communication paradigm raises great challenges to current research of UAV applications. As far as the robust channel allocation is concerned, the high mobility of UAV nodes and the unexpected disturbance of external environment would render most existing methods which rely on definite information and are vulnerable to dynamic environment, become less attractive or even invalid. In this paper, we particularly investigate a cellular-enabled mesh UAV network exploiting partially overlapping channels (POCs), and propose a distributed fuzzy space based learning scheme for POCs allocation to combat the dynamic environment. Rather than the perfect channel state information (CSI) assumption, the dynamic and uncertain CSI of UAVs is characterized by fuzzy number. On this basis, the allocation process can be implemented in a mapped fuzzy space. Integrating fuzzy-logic and game based learning, we formulate the problem of POCs assignment as a fuzzy payoffs game (FPG), and demonstrate the existence of fuzzy Nash equilibrium for our designed FPG. Then, with the derived priority vector in the fuzzy space, the equilibrium solution can be achieved by the proposed algorithm. Numerical simulations demonstrate the advantages of our new scheme.	https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9195753	0
Distributed Double-Layer Control for Coordination of Multiplatoons Approaching Road Restriction in the Presence of IoV Communication Delays	Internet of Vehicle (IoV) has become a hot topic in the last years due to its significant benefits in transportation systems in terms of quality, costs, and traffic management capability. Indeed, accurate and real-time information acquisition and diffusion are required to reach an efficient traffic management system according to the smart city paradigm. In this context, this article provides a novel IoV-based distributed double layer control architecture to address the coordination control problem of connected autonomous vehicles (CAVs) multiple platoons negotiating the access to a road section restriction in the presence of heterogeneous communication time-varying delays. To this aim, leveraging the IoV paradigm and the equivalent virtual formation concept, we propose a novel distributed diffusive longitudinal protocol and a distributed lateral potential-function-based control strategy, where both of them are able to cope with communication delays and ensuring the multiplatoon coordination in finite time, i.e., before accessing the road section restrictions, so to avoid vehicles collisions. The finite-time stability of both the cooperative controllers is analytically proved by exploiting the Lyapunov–Krasovskii theory and the derived delay-dependent stability conditions, expressed as a set of linear matrix inequalities (LMIs), allows the proper tuning of the controllers gains. Numerical analysis confirms the theoretical derivation and discloses the effectiveness and the robustness of the proposed cooperative multiplatoon control in ensuring the safe crossing of the road section restriction in finite time.	https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9507523	0
BCC: Blockchain-Based Collaborative Crowdsensing in Autonomous Vehicular Networks	The vehicular crowdsensing, which benefits from edge computing devices (ECDs) distributedly selecting autonomous vehicles (AVs) to complete the sensing tasks and collecting the sensing results, represents a practical and promising solution to facilitate the autonomous vehicular networks (AVNs). With frequent data transaction and rewards distribution in the crowdsensing process, how to design an integrated scheme which guarantees the privacy of AVs and enables the ECDs to earn rewards securely while minimizing the task execution cost (TEC) therefore becomes a challenge. To this end, in this article, we develop a blockchain-based collaborative crowdsensing (BCC) scheme to support secure and efficient vehicular crowdsensing in AVNs. In the BCC, by considering the potential attacks in the crowdsensing process, we first develop a secure crowdsensing environment by designing a blockchain-based transaction architecture to deal with privacy and security issues. With the designed architecture, we then propose a coalition game with a transferable reward to motivate AVs to cooperatively execute the crowdsensing tasks by jointly considering the requirements of the tasks and the available sensing resources of AVs. After that, based on the merge and split rules, a coalition formation algorithm is designed to help each ECD select a group of AVs to form the optimal crowdsensing coalition (OCC) with the target of minimizing the TEC. Finally, we evaluate the TEC of the task and the rewards of the ECDs by comparing the proposed scheme with other schemes. The results show that our scheme can lead to a lower TEC for completing crowdsensing tasks and bring higher rewards to ECDs than the conventional schemes.	https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9515441	0
Secrecy Energy Efficiency Maximization in UAV-Enabled Wireless Sensor Networks Without Eavesdropper’s CSI	Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) are anticipated to be a potential data collection solution for wireless sensor networks (WSNs). The main challenges of integrating UAVs in WSNs are security threats and UAV’s onboard energy limitation. To cope with these two challenges, this article examines the secrecy energy efficiency (SEE) maximization problem in UAV-enabled WSN. Specifically, a full-duplex (FD) UAV gathers confidential information from ground sensor nodes (SNs) in the uplink while sending jamming signals to confound a ground eavesdropper (Eve) in the downlink. Considering a passive eavesdropping scenario lacking Eve’s instantaneous channel state information (CSI), the resulting problem is subject to the constraints of connection outage probability (COP), secrecy outage probability (SOP), securely collected bits, and flight trajectory. To tackle the intractable nonconvex problem, we first derive the optimal codeword rate and redundancy rate in closed-form expressions and then develop a low-complexity algorithm using the block coordinate descent (BCD) approach to alternatively optimize the SN scheduling, SN transmit power, UAV transmit power, and UAV trajectory. Simulation results verify the performance gains of the proposed scheme compared with the benchmark schemes. In particular, the proposed scheme achieves nearly the same secrecy rate gains at a lower UAV’s energy consumption cost than the sum secrecy rate maximization (SSRM) baseline. Moreover, it is revealed that trajectory optimization of the proposed scheme plays a crucial role in improving SEE performance compared with the circle trajectory (CT) baseline.	https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9490362	0
Evaluating Adversarial Attacks on Driving Safety in Vision-Based Autonomous Vehicles	In recent years, many deep learning models have been adopted in autonomous driving. At the same time, these models introduce new vulnerabilities that may compromise the safety of autonomous vehicles. Specifically, recent studies have demonstrated that adversarial attacks can cause a significant decline in detection precision of deep learning-based 3-D object detection models. Although driving safety is the ultimate concern for autonomous driving, there is no comprehensive study on the linkage between the performance of deep learning models and the driving safety of autonomous vehicles under adversarial attacks. In this article, we investigate the impact of two primary types of adversarial attacks, perturbation attacks, and patch attacks, on the driving safety of vision-based autonomous vehicles rather than the detection precision of deep learning models. In particular, we consider two state-of-the-art models in vision-based 3-D object detection: 1) Stereo R-CNN and 2) DSGN. To evaluate driving safety, we propose an end-to-end evaluation framework with a set of driving safety performance metrics. By analyzing the results of our extensive evaluation experiments, we find that: 1) the attack’s impact on the driving safety of autonomous vehicles and the attack’s impact on the precision of 3-D object detectors are decoupled and 2) the DSGN model demonstrates stronger robustness to adversarial attacks than the Stereo R-CNN model. In addition, we further investigate the causes behind the two findings with an ablation study. The findings of this article provide a new perspective to evaluate adversarial attacks and guide the selection of deep learning models in autonomous driving.	https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9493770	0
Access Control Protocol for Battlefield Surveillance in Drone-Assisted IoT Environment	Surveillance drones, called as unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), are aircrafts that are utilized to collect video recordings, still images, or live video of the targets, such as vehicles, people or specific areas. Particularly in battlefield surveillance, there is high possibility of eavesdropping, inserting, modifying or deleting the messages during communications among the deployed drones and ground station server (GSS). This leads to launch several potential attacks by an adversary, such as main-in-middle, impersonation, drones hijacking, replay attacks, etc. Moreover, anonymity and untraceability are two crucial security properties that need to be maintained in battlefield surveillance communication environment. To deal with such a crucial security problem, we propose a new access control protocol for battlefield surveillance in drone-assisted Internet of Things (IoT) environment, called ACPBS-IoT. Through the detailed security analysis using formal and informal (nonmathematical), and also the formal security verification under automated software simulation tool, we show that the proposed ACPBS-IoT can resist several potential attacks needed in a battlefield surveillance scenario. Furthermore, the testbed experiments for various cryptographic primitives have been performed for measuring the execution time. Finally, a detailed comparative study on communication and computational overheads, and security, as well as functionality features, reveals that the proposed ACPBS-IoT provides superior security and more functionality features, and better or comparable overheads than other existing competing access control schemes.	https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9312672	0
Stochastic Optimization-Aided Energy-Efficient Information Collection in Internet of Underwater Things Networks	In the face of deeply exploring and exploiting marine resources, the Internet of Underwater Things (IoUT) networks have drawn great attention considering its widely distributed low-cost and easy-deployment smart sensing nodes. However, given the hostile underwater environment, it is critical to conceive energy-efficient information collection because of limited underwater energy supply and inefficient artificial recharge methods. Characterized by high flexibility and maneuverability, autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs) are regarded as a promising solution for information collection in the IoUT relying upon delicate AUVs’ trajectory and information collection strategy design with the spirit of balancing their energy consumption and information processing capability. In this article, we propose a heterogeneous AUV-aided information collection system with the aim of maximizing the energy efficiency of IoUT nodes taking into account AUV trajectory, resource allocation, and the Age of Information (AoI). Moreover, based on the particle swarm optimization (PSO), we obtain the trajectory of AUVs with low time complexity. Additionally, a two-stage joint optimization algorithm based on the Lyapunov optimization is constructed to strike a tradeoff between energy efficiency and system queue backlog iteratively.

Fully Onboard AI-Powered Human-Drone Pose Estimation on Ultralow-Power Autonomous Flying Nano-UAVs	Many emerging applications of nano-sized unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), with a few cm<sup>2</sup> form-factor, revolve around safely interacting with humans in complex scenarios, for example, monitoring their activities or looking after people needing care. Such sophisticated autonomous functionality must be achieved while dealing with severe constraints in payload, battery, and power budget (&#x007E;<b>100mW</b>). In this work, we attack a complex task going from perception to control: to estimate and maintain the nano-UAV&#x2019;s relative 3-D pose with respect to a person while they freely move in the environment&#x2014;a task that, to the best of our knowledge, has never previously been targeted with fully onboard computation on a nano-sized UAV. Our approach is centered around a novel vision-based deep neural network (DNN), called Frontnet, designed for deployment on top of a parallel ultra-low power (PULP) processor aboard a nano-UAV. We present a vertically integrated approach starting from the DNN model design, training, and dataset augmentation down to 8-bit quantization and deployment in-field. PULP-Frontnet can operate in real-time (up to <b>135 frame/s</b>), consuming less than <b>87 mW</b> for processing at peak throughput and down to <b>0.43 mJ/frame</b> in the most energy-efficient operating point. Field experiments demonstrate a closed-loop top-notch autonomous navigation capability, with a tiny 27-g Crazyflie 2.1 nano-UAV. Compared against an ideal sensing setup, onboard pose inference yields excellent drone behavior in terms of median absolute errors, such as positional (onboard: <b>41cm</b>, ideal: <b>26 cm</b>) and angular (onboard: <b>3.7&#x00B0;</b>, ideal: <b>4.1&#x00B0;</b>). We publicly release videos and the source code of our work.	https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9462495	0
Cooperative Control of Physical Collision and Transmission Power for UAV Swarm: A Dual-Fields Enabled Approach	This article studies the collision avoidance and interference mitigation for unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) swarm where many UAVs track a common target. The considered problem is formulated to jointly minimize the average interference and ensure the collision avoidance among UAVs. By exploiting the problem characteristics, our major contributions are summarized as follows. First, the singular case tolerance (SCT)-artificial potential field (APF) is proposed to overcome the failure of traditional APFs in collision avoidance, where the repulsive force gain coefficient among UAVs is dynamically controlled by the corresponding interferences. Second, the mean-field game (MFG) model is established to control communication power, where the instantaneous interferences among flying UAVs are represented by the mean-field approximation. Third, considering the tight coupling of trajectory and interference of UAVs, a cooperative control approach enabled by dual-fields is proposed to jointly adjust the trajectories and power of UAVs. Simulation results validate the significant performance improvement of the cooperative control approach enabled by dual-fields. Compared with separate APF and MFG, the proposed dual-field-cooperation approach can achieve about 117% throughput gain and 88% interference reduction when the UAV swarm is close to the target.	https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9481938	0
RAMP-IoD: A Robust Authenticated Key Management Protocol for the Internet of Drones	Internet of Drones (IoD) is the interconnection of unmanned aerial vehicles or drones deployed for collecting sensitive data to be used in critical applications. The drones transmit the collected data to the control room (CR) for analysis, while CR sends control commands to the drone to monitor their operations. This exchange of information between the drones and CR takes place through a wireless communication channel, which is susceptible to various security risks. Therefore, it is vital to ensure the confidentiality and integrity of such information in the IoD environment. To this end, authenticated key management (AKM) protocols can be leveraged to provide reliable and secure communication. However, due to the peculiarities associated with IoD environments, it is challenging to devise a robust and resource-efficient AKM protocol. To tackle this challenge, in this article, we propose a robust AKM protocol for IoD (RAMP-IoD). RAMP-IoD uses lightweight cryptography-based authenticated encryption primitive and elliptic-curve cryptography along with a hash function to perform the AKM process. Moreover, RAMP-IoD verifies the user’s authenticity and then sets up a session key (SK) between the user and a specific drone for indecipherable communications. We verify the security of SK using the random oracle model. Scyther-based validation demonstrates that RAMP-IoD is protected against replay and man-in-the-middle attacks. Moreover, the informal analysis illustrates that RAMP-IoD is secure against various covert security attacks. Through a comparative study, we also demonstrate that RAMP-IoD provides enhanced security with low storage, communication, and computational overheads as compared to related AKM protocols.	https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9446966	0
Joint Trajectory and Resource Optimization for UAV-Aided Two-Way Relay Networks	Unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV)-aided two-way relay networks with multiple terrestrial user pairs is investigated, where a fix-wing UAV is served as a two-way relay to assist information transmission. We aim to maximize the total rate of the two-way relay networks while the quality of service (QoS) being guaranteed. A novel relay strategy, namely <i>time-slots pairing</i>, is proposed by exploiting physical-layer network coding (PNC) protocol. Specifically, the UAV receives and buffers the signals from the scheduled user pair when the UAV approaches one of them, then forwards the modulated signal when the UAV is close to the other. As a result, a non-convex total rate maximization problem is formulated by joint trajectory design and resource optimization. To solve this problem, we first decompose it into three sub-problems, and then a three-step iterative algorithm that can effectively handle the non-convex problem with no worse than a polynomial complexity is developed leveraging the block coordinate descent (BCD) technique and successive convex approximation (SCA) method. Simulation results finally illustrate that: 1) Compared with amplify-and-forward (AF) or decode-and-forward (DF) protocols, the proposed design based on PNC protocol can significantly improve the total rate of the two-way relay networks; 2) the time-slots pairing relay strategy always achieves a significant enhancement on performance than the traditional non-time-slots pairing relay strategy; 3) the time-slots pairing relay strategy is more favorable for the mobile PNC relay networks since it can well resist the degradation of the entire networks caused by users&#x2019; increased service quality requirements.	https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9627548	0
Reconfigurable Intelligent Surface Assisted Multi-Carrier Wireless Systems for Doubly Selective High-Mobility Ricean Channels	Reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (RIS) constitute a revolutionary technique of beneficially reconfiguring the smart radio environment. However, despite the fact that wireless propagation is of time-varying nature, most of the existing RIS contributions focus on time-invariant scenarios for the following reasons. Firstly, it becomes impractical to instantaneously feed back the control signal based on the doubly selective non-line-of-sight (NLoS) fading scenario. Secondly, channel estimation conceived for the high-mobility and high-dimensional RIS-assisted links has to take into account the spatial-domain (SD), time-domain (TD), and frequency-domain (FD) correlations imposed by the angle-of-arrival/departure (AoA/AoD), the Doppler and the orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing (OFDM) operations, respectively, where none of the existing solutions can be directly applied. Thirdly, it is far from trivial to maximize the NLoS channel powers on all subcarriers by a common set of RIS reflecting coefficients. Fourthly, in the face of double selectivity, it becomes inevitable to encounter either inter-symbol interference (ISI) or inter-channel interference (ICI) during the signal detection in the TD or in the FD, respectively. Against this background, firstly, we focus our attention on line-of-sight (LoS) dominated unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) scenarios. Secondly, we conceive new minimum mean squared error (MMSE) channel estimation methods for doubly selective fading, which perodically transmit pilot symbols embedded into the TD and FD over the SD in order to beneficially exploit the correlations in the three domains. Thirdly, the RIS coefficients are optimized by a low-complexity algorithm based on the LoS representation of the end-to-end system model. Fourthly, tailor-made interference cancallation techniques are devised for improving the signal detection both in the FD and in the TD. Our simulation results are examined in six frequency bands licensed in 5 G, which confirms that the employment of RIS is capable of achieving substantial performance improvements.	https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9699402	0
Gaze Preserving CycleGANs for Eyeglass Removal and Persistent Gaze Estimation	A driver’s gaze is critical for determining theirattention, state, situational awareness, and readiness to take over control from partially automated vehicles. Estimating the gaze direction is the most obvious way to gauge a driver’s state under ideal conditions when limited to using non-intrusive imaging sensors. Unfortunately, the vehicular environment introduces a variety of challenges that are usually unaccounted for - harsh illumination, nighttime conditions, and reflective eyeglasses. Relying on head pose alone under such conditions can prove to be unreliable and erroneous. In this study, we offer solutions to address these problems encountered in the real world. To solve issues with lighting, we demonstrate that using an infrared camera with suitable equalization and normalization suffices. To handle eyeglasses and their corresponding artifacts, we adopt image-to-image translation using generative adversarial networks to pre-process images prior to gaze estimation. Our proposed Gaze Preserving CycleGAN (GPCycleGAN) is trained to preserve the driver’s gaze while removing potential eyeglasses from face images. GPCycleGAN is based on the well-known CycleGAN approach - with the addition of a gaze classifier and a gaze consistency loss for additional supervision. Our approach exhibits improved performance, interpretability, robustness and superior qualitative results on challenging real-world datasets.	https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9684928	0
Age of Information Modeling and Optimization for Fast Information Dissemination in Vehicular Social Networks	Autonomous vehicles (AVs) with advanced communication, computing, and control capabilities will provide not only a convenient means of transportation but also an emerging platform for real-time social communications and networking. Thereby, it is crucial to enable timely exchange of information over the dynamic cyber-physical-social system enabled by the AVs. In this paper, we consider age of information (AoI)-centric real-time information dissemination over vehicular social networks (VSNs), where the AoI captures the freshness of received data packets. We first propose a mathematical framework based on the mean-field theory (MFT) to analyze the network AoI (NAoI) of VSNs, namely AoI for the AV that lastly receives the information update in the network. The proposed analytical framework considers both the social features of vehicular networks, which are characterized using the scale-free network theory, and the underlying wireless communication process to evaluate the NAoI. Then, we further consider joint optimization of the information update rate at the source node and the transmit probabilities at the AVs for minimization of the average peak NAoI (PNAoI), i.e., the time average of peak values occurred in the evolution of the NAoI, which is solved via a novel parametric optimization scheme. Both analytical and simulation results show that compared with several baseline schemes, the proposed scheme can exploit the scale-free feature of the VSNs to significantly lower the average PNAoI by up to 96$\%$.	https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9730060	0
A Semidistributed Interior Point Algorithm for Optimal Coordination of Automated Vehicles at Intersections	In this article, we consider the optimal coordination of automated vehicles at intersections under fixed crossing orders. We formulate the problem using direct optimal control and exploit the structure to construct a semidistributed primal-dual interior-point algorithm to solve it by parallelizing most of the computations. Differently from standard distributed optimization algorithms, where the optimization problem is split, in our approach we split the linear algebra steps, such that the algorithm takes the same steps as a fully centralized one, while still performing computations in a distributed fashion. We analyze the communication requirements of the algorithm, and propose an approximation scheme which can significantly reduce the data exchange. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the algorithm in hard but realistic scenarios, which show that the approximation leads to reductions in communicated data of almost 99% of the exact formulation, at the expense of less than 1% suboptimality.	https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9658226	0
Multilines Imaging Approach for Mini-UAV Radar Imaging System	This letter deals with an imaging strategy able to manage effectively data collected on multiple lines by means of a Mini-Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (M-UAV) radar system operating in Sounder mode. The strategy, named multilines imaging approach (MIA), allows an effective 3-D pseudo-representation of the investigated volume. At the first step, MIA faces the problem of reconstructing 2-D domains (slices) by exploiting data collected on one or more lines. Then, MIA interpolates the 2-D reconstructions to provide the 3-D representation. The imaging of each slice is formulated as a linear inverse scattering problem, which is solved by means of the truncated singular value decomposition (TSVD) regularization scheme. The MIA effectiveness is assessed by processing real data collected at Archeological Park of Paestum and Velia, Paestum, Italy.	https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9464885	0
Fast and Robust Registration of Partially Overlapping Point Clouds	Real-time registration of partially overlapping point clouds has emerging applications in cooperative perception for autonomous vehicles and multi-agent SLAM. The relative translation between point clouds in these applications is higher than in traditional SLAM and odometry applications, which challenges the identification of correspondences and a successful registration. In this paper, we propose a novel registration method for partially overlapping point clouds where correspondences are learned using an efficient point-wise feature encoder, and refined using a graph-based attention network. This attention network exploits geometrical relationships between key points to improve the matching in point clouds with low overlap. At inference time, the relative pose transformation is obtained by robustly fitting the correspondences through sample consensus. The evaluation is performed on the KITTI dataset and a novel synthetic dataset including low-overlapping point clouds with displacements of up to 30 m. The proposed method achieves on-par performance with state-of-the-art methods on the KITTI dataset, and outperforms existing methods for low overlapping point clouds. Additionally, the proposed method achieves significantly faster inference times, as low as 410 ms, between 5 and 35 times faster than competing methods. Our code and dataset are available at https://github.com/eduardohenriquearnold/fastreg.	https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9662220	0
Hazardous Scenario Enhanced Generation for Automated Vehicle Testing Based on Optimization Searching Method	The scenario-based test method is the research hotspot of automated vehicle (AV) validation and verification (V&V), and testing with hazardous scenarios is of important means. An Optimization Searching (OS) method for enhanced generation in hazardous scenarios is proposed in this paper to efficiently explore functional boundary scenarios in a huge logical state space. The method is computationally tractable, and its generated experimental parameters are optimized using past test results. The method includes five essential modules. The Exploration and Exploitation module uses the Multi-arm bandit method to obtain the greatest sum of the  $TTC^{\mathbf {-1}}$  (Time To Collision). The Parameter Moving Probability Determination module uses an analytic hierarchy process to ensure that influential parameters are more likely to move. The Step Size Determination module is built with Levy-step to find a greater number of hazardous scenarios. The Memory Function module is used to avoid repeat experiments that can reduce computing efficiency. The Result Analysis module creates a hazard parameter space for subsequent tests. We tested an ACC (Adaptive Cruise Control) algorithm with a specified logical scenario in the virtual environment built by PreScan. The results showed that the OS method can effectively discover the dangerous range with the tested ACC algorithm, and its test speed can reach more than five times that of an exhaustive algorithm without prior knowledge.	https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9394813	0
Joint Optimization of Trajectory and Resource Allocation for Time-Constrained UAV-Enabled Cognitive Radio Networks	Unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV)-enabled communication has emerged as an irreplaceable technology in military, disaster relief and emergency scenarios. This correspondence investigates the average throughput in a UAV-enabled cognitive radio network, where the UAV is regarded as a dedicated secondary user to enhance the network coverage and spectral efficiency. Based on the probabilistic line-of-sight channel, we exploit the joint design of UAV trajectory and resource allocation to maximize the average throughput under the constraints of co-channel interference and completion time. The original problem is a mixed integer non-convex problem which is generally NP-hard. We first decompose the primal problem into a bilevel programming problem, and then propose an efficient high-quality algorithm based on the particle swarm optimization approach. The optimized trajectory reveals the trade-off between throughput and co-channel interference. Numerical results verify the superiority of the proposed algorithm as compared to other benchmark schemes.	https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9714863	0
MarkCapsNet: Road Marking Extraction From Aerial Images Using Self-Attention-Guided Capsule Network	High-definition map building and map navigation systems often require detailed, complete, and up-to-date data of road markings. The real-time and accurate recognition of road markings also serves significantly to the autonomous vehicles. This letter designs a self-attention (SA)-guided high-resolution capsule network to conduct road marking extraction from aerial images. First, by combining the superiorities of capsule formulation and high-resolution network architecture, this model behaves advantageously in providing fine-grained and strong feature semantics for promoting pixel-wise marking extraction accuracy. Furthermore, boosted by the capsule-based SA and adversarial learning mechanisms, the feature encoding quality and robustness are positively enhanced. Quantitative assessments, qualitative inspections, and comparative analyses on two aerial image datasets prove the excellent feasibility and effectiveness of the proposed model in road marking extraction tasks.	https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9597504	0
LBSV: Lightweight Blockchain Security Protocol for Secure Storage and Communication in SDN-Enabled IoV	The development of modern software-defined networking (SDN) solutions brings new opportunities in Internet-of-Vehicles (IoVs). However, the autonomous nature of the vehicular environment leads to unpredictable security vulnerabilities and reliability issues. The high computation overhead and storage requirements also pose a significant challenge in message dissemination. To overcome these issues, we introduce a lightweight blockchain-based security protocol for secure communication and storage in SDN-enabled IoV, known as LBSV. The LBSV is a permissioned blockchain network that uses the proposed modified practical byzantine fault tolerance (mPBFT) consensus algorithm. Additionally, the SDN-enabled network exploits the blockchain framework and schedules different procedures. The secure message dissemination is achieved through various cryptographic functions (i.e., elliptic curve cryptography (ECC) and the secure hash algorithm (SHA256)). The security analysis shows that the LBSV withstands various cyberattacks regarding message dissemination privacy. The experimental results show that LBSV provides high performance with 85% less computational cost, 55% less storage and communication overhead and 90% less consensus delay compared with state-of-the-art schemes.	https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9749014	0
FAST-LIO2: Fast Direct LiDAR-Inertial Odometry	This article presents FAST-LIO2: a fast, robust, and versatile LiDAR-inertial odometry framework. Building on a highly efficient tightly coupled iterated Kalman filter, FAST-LIO2 has two key novelties that allow fast, robust, and accurate LiDAR navigation (and mapping). The first one is directly registering raw points to the map (and subsequently update the map, i.e., mapping) without extracting features. This enables the exploitation of subtle features in the environment and, hence, increases the accuracy. The elimination of a hand-engineered feature extraction module also makes it naturally adaptable to emerging LiDARs of different scanning patterns; the second main novelty is maintaining a map by an incremental k-dimensional (k-d) tree data structure, incremental k-d tree (ikd-Tree), that enables incremental updates (i.e., point insertion and delete) and dynamic rebalancing. Compared with existing dynamic data structures (octree, R$^\ast$-tree, and nanoflann k-d tree), ikd-Tree achieves superior overall performance while naturally supports downsampling on the tree. We conduct an exhaustive benchmark comparison in 19 sequences from a variety of open LiDAR datasets. FAST-LIO2 achieves consistently higher accuracy at a much lower computation load than other state-of-the-art LiDAR-inertial navigation systems. Various real-world experiments on solid-state LiDARs with small field of view are also conducted. Overall, FAST-LIO2 is computationally efficient (e.g., up to 100 Hz odometry and mapping in large outdoor environments), robust (e.g., reliable pose estimation in cluttered indoor environments with rotation up to 1000 deg/s), versatile (i.e., applicable to both multiline spinning and solid-state LiDARs, unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) and handheld platforms, and Intel- and ARM-based processors), while still achieving a higher accuracy than existing methods. Our implementation of the system FAST-LIO2 and the data structure ikd-Tree are both open-sourced on Github.	https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9697912	0
A Fast and Efficient Attitude Control Algorithm of a Tilt-Rotor Aerial Platform Using Inputs Redundancies	Overactuated multirotor unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) usually consist of multiple tiltable thrust actuators. The controllers are mostly designed by regarding the thrust forces and actuator tilting angles as inputs of outer-loop position and attitude controllers, while formulating an inner-loop controller for each actuator to track the thrust and angle as required by the outer-loop. This hierarchical control strategy separates the complicated combined dynamics into two relatively simple systems, and thus simplifies the control design. However, the interaction between the two systems is neglected and therefore the control performance will be degraded when the inner-loop dynamics are not sufficiently fast. This letter investigates the capability of a new overactuated multirotor UAV configuration, where regular quadcopters are passively hinged onto the frame as tiltable thrust actuators. Apart from the thrust force and tilting angle, each actuator has additional auxiliary torque inputs, which exhibit fast responses as they are not subject to the inner-loop actuator tilting angle dynamics. In this letter, an add-on attitude compensation control is designed exploiting the auxiliary inputs to reduce the tracking and disturbance-rejection errors from the nominal control loop. The effectiveness is demonstrated in simulation and verified by experiment.	https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9664339	0
Trajectory and Transmit Power Optimization for IRS-Assisted UAV Communication Under Malicious Jamming	In this letter, we investigate an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) communication system, where an intelligent reflecting surface (IRS) is deployed to assist in the transmission from a ground node (GN) to the UAV in the presence of a jammer. We aim to maximize the average rate of the UAV commnunication by jointly optimizing the GN’s transmit power, the IRS’s passive beamforming and the UAV’s trajectory. However, the formulated problem is difficult to solve due to the non-convex objective function and the coupled optimization variables. Thus, to tackle it, we propose an alternating optimization (AO) based algorithm by exploiting the successive convex approximation (SCA) and semidefinite relaxation (SDR) techniques. Simulation results show that the proposed algorithm can significantly improve the average rate compared with the benchmark algorithms. Moreover, it also shows that when the jamming power is large and the number of IRS elements is relatively small, deploying the IRS near the jammer outperforms deploying it near the GN, and vice versa.	https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9810528	0
Hybrid-Learning-Based Driver Steering Intention Prediction Using Neuromuscular Dynamics	The emerging automated driving technology poses a new challenge to driver-automation collaboration, which requires a mutual understanding between humans and machines through their intention identifications. In this article, oriented by human–machine mutual understanding, a driver steering intention prediction method is proposed to better understand human driver's expectation during driver–vehicle interaction. The steering intention is predicted based on a novel hybrid-learning-based time-series model with deep learning networks. Two different driving modes, namely, both hands and single right-hand driving modes, are studied. Different electromyography signals from the upper limb muscles are collected and used for the steering intention prediction. The relationship between the neuromuscular dynamics and the steering torque is analyzed first. Then, the hybrid-learning-based model is developed to predict both the continuous and discrete steering intentions. The two intention prediction networks share the same temporal pattern exaction layer, which is built with the bidirectional recurrent neural network and long short-term memory cells. The model prediction performance is evaluated with a varied history and prediction horizon to exploit the model capability further. The experimental data are collected from 21 participants of varied ages and driving experience. The results show that the proposed method can achieve a prediction accuracy of around 95% steering under the two driving modes.	https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9361419	0
Blockchain-Enabled Conditional Decentralized Vehicular Crowdsensing System	The rapid growth of connected and autonomous vehicles (CAVs) shows an urgent demand for driving and transportation-related data, which gives rise to vehicular crowdsensing systems (VCSs). Nevertheless, the existing centralized VCS framework mainly faces the system reliability problem while the decentralized one cannot satisfy the management flexibility. In addition, when the privacy preservation scheme that prevents information leakage encounters the user selection scheme that desires detailed information of participants, how to balance this seemingly irreconcilable contradiction is inevitable for VCS. To remedy that, we take the first research attempt and explore the balance point between the system management, privacy preservation, and quality of experience (QoE) of participants. By fully exploiting the characters of participating entities, a blockchain-enabled conditional decentralized VCS is proposed in this paper. Firstly, we propose a privacy-preserving scheme where the zk-SNARK proof combines with the mixed-task smart contract to guarantee the interaction process will not reveal any private information of participants. Secondly, we propose an efficient reputation management mechanism that renders certain the participants can get a satisfactory QoE even under the condition that the private information of users is secured. And also, the malicious operations in the system will be effectively supervised. Theoretical analysis and extensive simulations demonstrate the security and efficiency properties of privacy preservation and indicate the effectiveness of reputation management.	https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9759228	0
Recurrent Models for Lane Change Prediction and Situation Assessment	Predicting future events accurately is a task of great importance for autonomous vehicles. In this work we focus on lane change events. For this, we propose a novel attention mechanism on top of recurrent neural networks for the prediction task, which improves performance and yields more interpretable models. As critical corner cases are often not considered and reflected in traditional prediction metrics, we additionally introduce a new scenario-based evaluation scheme, which we posit be considered for further maneuver prediction works. Prediction and planning tasks often are correlated, usually sharing input representations and differing in expected outputs and their subsequent consideration. Here, we detail a supporting layer for planning tasks, which analyzes situations w.r.t. their suitability for lane changes and can serve as decision-making support for any planning algorithm. Exploitation of similarities between this task and the aforementioned prediction problem further improves performance of the prediction task, as well as labelling quality of the assessment task. Additionally, we extend our evaluation to urban scenarios, showcasing the generalizability of our proposed prediction models.	https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9760277	0
Evolutionary Game Based Strategy Selection for Hybrid V2V Communications	Vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) communications is an important technology in vehicular ad hoc network (VANET) to support autonomous data exchange among vehicles. Multiple V2V communications modes have been investigated for VANET, including dedicated short-range communications (DSRC) based on IEEE 802.11p and LTE-V2X, which are suitable for different packet transmission cases. In order to fully exploit the strengths of various modes, hybrid V2V communications strategies are designed in this paper, where each vehicle is allowed to choose different modes for different kinds of transmissions in separate frequency bands for transmission throughput improvement. Furthermore, since it is usually impractical to decide all the vehicles’ communications strategies globally due to high computational complexity and heavy overhead to broadcast the decisions, we model the selection of hybrid V2V communications strategies for vehicles as an evolutionary game. A strategy selection algorithm is then proposed, where each vehicle can select its hybrid V2V communications strategy locally based on its evaluation of the payoffs for different strategies and limited signalling from the base station. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed algorithm can converge to an asymptotic stable state, which can improve the transmission throughput of vehicles, and is robust to the slight evaluation errors of payoffs and the strategy mutations of a few vehicles.	https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9633173	0
A New Modeling Approach for Predicting Vehicle-Based Safety Threats	Existing autonomous driving systems of intelligent vehicles such as advanced driver assistant systems (ADAS) assess and quantify the level of potential safety threats. However, they may not be able to plan the best response to unexpected dangerous situations and do not have the ability to cope with uncertainties since not all vehicles can always keep a safe gap from preceding vehicles and drive at a desired velocity. Previous research has not taken such uncertainties into account, it is, therefore, necessary to develop models which are not restricted by the predefined movement patterns of a vehicle. Existing systems are based on a model that estimates the threat level based only on one factor Time-To-Collision (TTC). This approach is limited since it cannot handle all scenarios and ignores all uncertainties. To overcome these limitations, this paper utilised deep learning to develop a range of models that rely on a group of factors to reliably estimate the threat level and predict conflicts under uncertainty using the concept of looming ’. Comparative analyses were undertaken by incorporating new varying input factors to each model (e.g., surrogate safety measures, vehicle kinematics, macroscopic traffic data). Real-world experiments demonstrated that adding new factors increases the reliability and sensitivity of the models. Results also indicated that the models that consider looming provide low false alarm rate extending their applications for a wider spectrum of traffic scenarios. This is paramount for ADAS as uncertainties are inherent in the deployment of connected and autonomous vehicles in a mixed traffic stream.	https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9733966	0
An Inverse Reinforcement Learning Approach for Customizing Automated Lane Change Systems	Vehicle automation seeks to enhance road safety and improve the driving experience. However, a standard system does not account for variations in users and driving conditions. Customizing vehicle automation based on users’ preferences aims to improve the user experience and adoption of the technologies. This study introduces a systematic paradigm that starts with naturalistic driving data to identify the driving behaviors and styles for a customized automated lane change system. The driving behaviors are first extracted using Multivariate Functional Principal Component Analysis (MFPCA) with minimum prior expert knowledge. The driving styles are identified by clustering the extracted driving behaviors. An Inverse Reinforcement Learning (IRL) algorithm is then used to train the automated lane change system from grouped demonstrations of the identified driving styles to capture the preferences of a group of drivers with a similar driving style. The performance of the proposed customized automated lane change system is compared to (1) a non-customized system trained on all the sample trips, (2) customized systems built on expert-coded reward functions, and (3) customized systems trained using a Generative Adversarial Imitation Learning (GAIL) algorithm. The results show that our method outperforms all the other systems with respect to the prediction accuracy of the lane change actions. Additionally, our method gains insights on the representative behaviors of different driving styles to enable customization of automated lane change systems.	https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9785911	0
Privacy-Preserved Federated Learning for Autonomous Driving	In recent years, the privacy issue in Vehicular Edge Computing (VEC) has gained a lot of concern. The privacy problem is even more severe in autonomous driving business than the other businesses in VEC such as ordinary navigation. Federated learning (FL), which is a privacy-preserved strategy proposed by Google, has become a hot trend to solve the privacy problem in many fields including VEC. Therefore, we introduce FL into autonomous driving to preserve vehicular privacy by keeping original data in a local vehicle and sharing the training model parameter only with the help of MEC server. Moreover, different from the common assumption of honest MEC server and honest vehicle in former studies, we take the malicious MEC servers and malicious vehicles into account. First, we consider honest-but-curious MEC server and malicious vehicles and propose a traceable identity-based privacy preserving scheme to protect the vehicular message privacy where improved Dijk-Gentry-Halevi-Vaikutanathan (DGHV) algorithm is proposed and a blockchain-based Reputation-based Incentive Autonomous Driving Mechanism (RIADM) is adopted. Further, when the case comes to the non-credibility of both parties where semi-honest MEC server and malicious vehicles are considered, we propose an anonymous identity-based privacy preserving scheme to protect the identity privacy of vehicles with Zero-Knowledge Proof (ZKP). Based on the simulation of virtual autonomous driving based on real-world road images, it is verified that our proposes scheme can reduce 73.7 % training loss of autonomous driving, increase the accuracy to around 5.55 % while keeps effective privacy of message and identity under the threat of dishonest MEC server and vehicles.	https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9457207	0
Reachability Analysis of Cyber-Physical Systems Under Stealthy Attacks	This article studies the reachable set of cyber-physical systems subject to stealthy attacks with the Kullback–Leibler divergence adopted to describe the stealthiness. The reachable set is defined as the set in which both the system state and the estimation error of the Kalman filter reside with a certain probability. The necessary and sufficient conditions of the reachable set being unbounded are given for the finite and infinite time cases, respectively. When the reachable set is bounded, an ellipsoidal outer approximation is obtained by solving a convex optimization problem. An application of this approximation to the safety evaluation is also given. A numerical simulation of an unmanned ground vehicle is presented to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach.	https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9244223	0
A Reinforcement Learning Approach for Enacting Cautious Behaviours in Autonomous Driving System: Safe Speed Choice in the Interaction With Distracted Pedestrians	Driving requires the ability to handle unpredictable situations. Since it is not always possible to predict an impending danger, a good driver should preventively assess whether a situation has risks and adopt a safe behavior. Considering, in particular, the possibility of a pedestrian suddenly crossing the road, a prudent driver should limit the traveling speed. We present a work exploiting reinforcement learning to learn a function that specifies the safe speed limit for a given artificial driver agent. The safe speed function acts as a behavioral directive for the agent, thus extending its cognitive abilities. We consider scenarios where the vehicle interacts with a distracted pedestrian that might cross the road in hard-to-predict ways and propose a neural network mapping the pedestrian’s context onto the appropriate traveling speed so that the autonomous vehicle can successfully perform emergency braking maneuvers. We discuss the advantages of developing a specialized neural network extension on top of an already functioning autonomous driving system, removing the burden of learning to drive from scratch while focusing on learning safe behavior at a high-level. We demonstrate how the safe speed function can be learned in simulation and then transferred into a real vehicle. We include a statistical analysis of the network’s improvements compared to the original autonomous driving system. The code implementing the presented network is available at https://github.com/tonegas/safe-speed-neural-network with MIT license and at https://zenodo.org/communities/dreams4cars.	https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9456943	0
Detection and Isolation of Sensor Attacks for Autonomous Vehicles: Framework, Algorithms, and Validation	This paper investigates the cyber-security problem for autonomous vehicles under sensor attacks. In particular, a model-based framework is proposed which can detect sensor attacks and identify their sources in order to achieve the secure localization of self-driving vehicles. To ensure robustness of the vehicle against cyber-attacks, sensor redundancy is introduced, that is to deploy multiple sensors, each of which provides real-time pose observations of the vehicle. A bank of attack detectors is developed to capture anomalies in each sensor measurement, which is a combination of an extended Kalman filter (EKF) and a cumulative sum (CUSUM) discriminator. EKFs are employed to estimate the vehicle position and orientation recursively, while each CUSUM discriminator is designed to analyze the residual generated by its combined EKF to detect the possible deviation of the sensor measurement from the expected pose derived according to the mathematical model of the vehicle. To monitor the inconsistency amongst multiple sensor measurements, an auxiliary detector is introduced which fuses observations from multiple sensors. Based on the results of all the detectors, a rule-based isolation scheme is developed to identify the source anomalous sensor. The effectiveness of our proposed framework has been demonstrated on real vehicle data.	https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9430762	0
Attacks on Formation Control for Multiagent Systems	Multiagent systems (MASs) are distributed systems with two or more intelligent agents. Formation control is a significant control technique of MASs. To date, formation control on MASs is widely used in various fields, such as robots, spacecrafts, satellites, and unmanned aerial/surface/underwater vehicles. However, there is a relatively small body of literature that is concerned with security problems of formation control on MASs in past years. Our research represents the first step toward developing security attacks of formation control on MASs. Our study aims to investigate potential security problems of formation control on a multirobot system for the first time. We propose two kinds of control-level attacks and each kind of attack includes several specific attack forms. Then, we discuss specific features of formation control on a classical multirobot system and utilize theoretical analyses to illustrate how cyberattacks can influence the physical movements of robots. The experimental results of the proposed attacks show that attacks can easily interrupt formation movements of a multirobot system and several carefully designed attacks even can cause irreversible loss.	https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9484672	0
MTH-IDS: A Multitiered Hybrid Intrusion Detection System for Internet of Vehicles	Modern vehicles, including connected vehicles and autonomous vehicles, nowadays involve many electronic control units connected through intravehicle networks (IVNs) to implement various functionalities and perform actions. Modern vehicles are also connected to external networks through vehicle-to-everything technologies, enabling their communications with other vehicles, infrastructures, and smart devices. However, the improving functionality and connectivity of modern vehicles also increase their vulnerabilities to cyber-attacks targeting both intravehicle and external networks due to the large attack surfaces. To secure vehicular networks, many researchers have focused on developing intrusion detection systems (IDSs) that capitalize on machine learning methods to detect malicious cyber-attacks. In this article, the vulnerabilities of intravehicle and external networks are discussed, and a multitiered hybrid IDS that incorporates a signature-based IDS and an anomaly-based IDS is proposed to detect both known and unknown attacks on vehicular networks. Experimental results illustrate that the proposed system can detect various types of known attacks with 99.99% accuracy on the CAN-intrusion-dataset representing the IVN data and 99.88% accuracy on the CICIDS2017 data set illustrating the external vehicular network data. For the zero-day attack detection, the proposed system achieves high F1-scores of 0.963 and 0.800 on the above two data sets, respectively. The average processing time of each data packet on a vehicle-level machine is less than 0.6 ms, which shows the feasibility of implementing the proposed system in real-time vehicle systems. This emphasizes the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed IDS.	https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9443234	0
CSG: Classifier-Aware Defense Strategy Based on Compressive Sensing and Generative Networks for Visual Recognition in Autonomous Vehicle Systems	Visual classification algorithms based-on Deep Neural Networks (DNN) have been widely adopted in autonomous vehicle design. However, DNN suffers from adversarial attacks including pixel attacks and patch attacks, and its adoption may introduce new vulnerability into such security-critical scenarios. Existing defense techniques only focus on defending against one category, either pixel attacks or patch attacks, but does not translate to the other. Hence, the design of a practical comprehensive real-time defense algorithm for DNN-based classifiers presents a challenging task in this adversarial context. This paper attempts to address the abovementioned problem by combining Compressive Sensing with Generative neural networks (CSG) to construct an efficient defense framework, in conjunction with the proposal of a classifier-aware adversarial training way. Extensive experiments have been conducted using the LISA road sign dataset to evaluate the performance of CSG. The results show its superiority in comprehensively defending adversarial examples generated using attacks including CW-L2, FGSM and Sticker, compared with other state-of-the-art defense techniques.	https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9713747	0
Secure Privacy-Preserving V2V Communication in 5G-V2X Supporting Network Slicing	As autonomous driving technology continues to develop, communication for vehicles is becoming more important to provide an efficient and secure driving environment. Currently, vehicle-to-everything (V2X) based on fifth-generation (5G) is the only solution to meet the demanding requirements of self-driving cars in terms of ultra-low latency and ultra-high reliable connectivity under high mobility conditions, earning this technology more attention. Secure communication for vehicle-to-vehicle based on 5G (5G-V2V) is essential because vehicles decide how to maneuver and perceive situations based on the data exchanged. In this paper, we not only propose a new architecture for V2X based on 5G (5G-V2X) by utilizing network slicing (NS) to guarantee different features of V2X services but also analyze security requirements according to V2X service type. We also propose a secure V2V communication scheme based on 5G that satisfies these requirements. The security evaluation demonstrates that our scheme is secure against attacks on a V2V environment via both security proof and verification tool ProVerif. Through the performance evaluation, we prove that our scheme is more effective than the existing schemes while meeting end-to-end delay requirements for autonomous driving.	https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9632277	0
Fundamental Behaviors in Hybrid Deterministic Flow Lines With Applications	Since the mid-1960s, it has been known that regular or deterministic flow lines (DFLs) with an arbitrary arrival process possess three essential behaviors: 1) a customer exit time recursion; 2) a server reordering principle; and 3) a delay equivalence with prototype queueing systems. Even though these three fundamental behaviors were discovered decades ago, analogous results for hybrid DFLs (HDFLs)—possessing multiple servers for each stage—have not been unearthed. In this article, we prove the existence of a recursion for customer exit times in HDFLs. This result leads naturally to a server reordering principle. Furthermore, we identify specific conditions under which the total delay faced by a customer in an HDFL is equivalent to that in a  $G/D/c$  queue. Exploiting these results, we numerically determine the proportion of HDFL systems with a delay equivalent, study the computational burdens required for HDFL simulation, and assess the performance of approximations for HDFL systems. We hope these newly identified behaviors will lead to improved approximation methods and optimization models for use in modern automated manufacturing systems. Note to Practitioners—Many modern automated manufacturing systems, such as semiconductor wafer fabricators, use hundreds or thousands of highly complex, costly, and precise tools. These automated tools are often configured as a collection of processing modules served by material handling robots and clustered into a single chassis. One important example of such cluster tools is the clustered photolithography tool (CPT). For certain key performance metrics, including cycle time, residency time, and throughput time, such tools can be well-modeled as a tandem queueing system with random arrivals, regular or deterministic service times, multiple servers devoted to each stage, and finite internal buffers—a so-called HDFL. Such HDFLs also serve as a fundamental model of automated assembly systems. In this work, we prove that the behavior of HDFLs can be characterized by an exit recursion that requires significantly less computation than otherwise. Furthermore, HDFLs possess the surprising property that the customer queueing time is invariant to the order of the stages and, in some cases, is equivalent to a prototype queueing system. These results can be exploited to assess customer delay and to obtain simulation models with about an order of magnitude less computational complexity. We apply our results to a CPT model from the literature to highlight the properties of such tools. Finally, the theory introduced in this article enables a deeper understanding and intuition for such systems.	https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9395144	0
A Systematic Solution of Human Driving Behavior Modeling and Simulation for Automated Vehicle Studies	Though automated vehicles (AVs) are believed to play a crucial role in future transport, human driving vehicles will share the road with automated vehicles for a relatively long period. So, we need to enable automated vehicles to run along with human drivers especially when they may have conflicts in the right of way. One key problem is how to appropriately model human driving behaviors and quickly simulate their actions when training/testing automated vehicles. Many existing models were originally built for traffic flow studies and may not be suitable for automated vehicles studies. In this paper, we propose a set of new principles of human driving behaviors modeling and simulations. Then, we propose a Data-Driven Simulator (D2Sim) model for human behavior learning, description, and vehicle interaction simulation. In contrast to conventional microscopic traffic flow models, the D2Sim is a trajectory generation model that accepts rich driving environment information (e.g., lane geometry, crosswalks, traffic signals, surrounding vehicles, etc.). Different from many empirical trajectory records replay models, we can arbitrarily set the long-term intentions of the simulated vehicles and intentionally design the corner cases that had not been observed in practice. In addition, the D2Sim adopts adversarial learning to comprehend complex yet stochastic human driving behaviors from empirical data. Testing results show that the proposed model can quickly generate high-resolution trajectory data for training and testing.	https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9767202	0
A Reputation-Based Leader Election Scheme for Opportunistic Autonomous Vehicle Platoon	As an emerging concept in the intelligent transportation system (ITS), Opportunistic Autonomous Vehicle Platoon (OAVP) enables autonomous vehicles to self-organize a temporary platoon and travel together. Whereas, electing the platoon leader is a crucial issue to be solved in this scenario. The platoon leader not only suffers from more wind resistance but also spends more computation resources in dealing with tremendous information obtained from the surrounding environment. Hence, vehicles tend to be a follower rather than a leader. In this paper, we propose a reputation-based leader election system for OAVP named RLE, which contains two sub-systems: leader election and incentive mechanism. In the former one, a reputation-based election scheme is first constructed to elect a relatively trustful leader according to the reputation value recorded on the blockchain. The proposed scheme integrates previous experience with recommendations from other members. In the second sub-system, an incentive mechanism is designed to stimulate platoon members to participate actively in the process of election, which is based on the recorded real-time fuel economy among vehicles participating in a platoon. Security analysis shows that the system is sufficient to deal with potential security threats. Experimental results based on the simulated platform demonstrate the practicality and feasibility of our solution.	https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9520239	0
A Novel Direct Trajectory Planning Approach Based on Generative Adversarial Networks and Rapidly-Exploring Random Tree	Trajectory planning is essential for self-driving vehicles and has stringent requirements for accuracy and efficiency. The existing trajectory planning methods have limitations in the feasibility of planned trajectories and computational efficiency. This paper proposes a life-long learning framework to achieve effective and high-accuracy direct trajectory planning (DTP) tasks. Based on generative adversarial networks (GANs), this study develops a lightweight GDTP model to map the initial/final states and the control action sequence. Additionally, by embedding the GDTP into the rapidly-exploring random tree (RRT), a GDTP-RRT algorithm is further designed for long-distance and multi-stage planning tasks. Taking the tractor-trailer as an application case, we test the proposed method in multiple scenarios with varying characteristics. The experimental results show that the method can plan highly feasible trajectories in a short time, compared with the most applied algorithm – the cubic curve RRT* (CCRRT*). It is found that the tracking errors of our method are 29.1% and 44.1% lower than the CCRRT* in terms of position and heading angle. This paper provides an effective and stable vehicle trajectory planning method for complex self-driving tasks.	https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9756640	0
Security Vulnerabilities and Protection Algorithms for Backpressure-Based Traffic Signal Control at an Isolated Intersection	There is an increasing trend in the use of wireless communication along with new traffic signal control (TSC) algorithms to leverage and accommodate connected and autonomous vehicles. However, this development has increased the potential for cyber-attacks on TSC that can undermine the benefits of these new algorithms. An advanced persistent adversary can learn the behavior of TSC algorithms and launch attacks to preferentially get green time and/or to create traffic congestion in one intersection which can spread to the entire network. In this paper, we consider backpressure-based (BP-based) TSC algorithms and compare their performance under two misinformation attacks - 1) time spoofing attack in which vehicles alter their arrival times at the intersection and 2) ghost vehicle attack in which vehicles disconnect the wireless communication and thereby hide from the TSC. We show that these misinformation can influence the signal phases determined by BP-based TSC algorithms. We consider an adversary that determines a set of arriving vehicles to be attack vehicles from many candidate sets (attack strategies) in order to maximize the number of disrupted signal phases. We show that by formulating the problem as a 0/1 Knapsack problem, the adversary can explore the space of attack strategies and determine the optimal strategy that maximally compromises the performance in terms of average delay and fairness. We propose two protection algorithms, namely, auction-based (APA) and hybrid-based (HPA) algorithms and show that they are able to mitigate the impacts of the misinformation attacks.	https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9356466	0
A Secure and Lightweight Drones-Access Protocol for Smart City Surveillance	The rising popularity of ICT and the Internet has enabled Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) to offer advantageous assistance to Vehicular Ad-hoc Network (VANET), realizing a relay node’s role among the disconnected segments in the road. In this scenario, the communication is done between Vehicles to UAVs (V2U), subsequently transforming into a UAV-assisted VANET. UAV-assisted VANET allows users to access real-time data, especially the monitoring data in smart cities using current mobile networks. Nevertheless, due to the open nature of communication infrastructure, the high mobility of vehicles along with the security and privacy constraints are the significant concerns of UAV-assisted VANET. In these scenarios, Deep Learning Algorithms (DLA) could play an effective role in the security, privacy, and routing issues of UAV-assisted VANET. Keeping this in mind, we have devised a DLA-based key-exchange protocol for UAV-assisted VANET. The proposed protocol extends the scalability and uses secure bitwise XOR operations, one-way hash functions, including user’s biometric verification when users and drones are mutually authenticated. The proposed protocol can resist many well-known security attacks and provides formal and informal security under the Random Oracle Model (ROM). The security comparison shows that the proposed protocol outperforms the security performance in terms of running time cost and communication cost and has effective security features compared to other related protocols.	https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9646496	0
A Cloud-Assisted Reliable Trust Computing Scheme for Data Collection in Internet of Things	Large number of Internet of Things (IoT) applications with intelligent sensing devices (ISDs) are combined with cloud computing to collect and process data more efficiently. However, ISDs are vulnerable to various attacks. Compromised devices may maliciously provide unreliable data to the cloud, causing damage to IoT applications. Therefore, it is a critical issue to design an effective mechanism to ensure the security of data collection in cloud computing. In this article, a cloud-assisted reliable trust computing (CRTC) scheme is proposed to identify the trust of ISDs at low cost, providing high-quality data for IoT applications. The CRTC scheme mainly includes the following parts: First, a reliable approach of obtaining the real data of ISDs at a low cost is proposed to identify the trust of ISDs. In the proposed method, ISDs fits the forwarding packets information to form inspection information (II) with a small amount of data and then sends II to inspection nodes, effectively reducing the cost of routing II. Second, an effective method of trust computing is given to evaluate the trustworthiness of ISDs based on the data and II collected by unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV). Then, the aggregators are selected from high-trust ISDs to ensure secure data collection. Third, to obtain more reliable trust at lower cost, a trajectory optimization algorithm for UAV is proposed to collect as much II as possible and reduce the moving distance. Theoretical analysis and experimental results show that the proposed CRTC scheme is superior to previous strategies in terms of the success rate of data collection, the speed of identifying the trust of ISDs, and the UAV's trajectory distance.	https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9525252	0
Vehicle Detection From UAV Imagery With Deep Learning: A Review	Vehicle detection from unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) imagery is one of the most important tasks in a large number of computer vision-based applications. This crucial task needed to be done with high accuracy and speed. However, it is a very challenging task due to many characteristics related to the aerial images and the used hardware, such as different vehicle sizes, orientations, types, density, limited datasets, and inference speed. In recent years, many classical and deep-learning-based methods have been proposed in the literature to address these problems. Handed engineering- and shallow learning-based techniques suffer from poor accuracy and generalization to other complex cases. Deep-learning-based vehicle detection algorithms achieved better results due to their powerful learning ability. In this article, we provide a review on vehicle detection from UAV imagery using deep learning techniques. We start by presenting the different types of deep learning architectures, such as convolutional neural networks, recurrent neural networks, autoencoders, generative adversarial networks, and their contribution to improve the vehicle detection task. Then, we focus on investigating the different vehicle detection methods, datasets, and the encountered challenges all along with the suggested solutions. Finally, we summarize and compare the techniques used to improve vehicle detection from UAV-based images, which could be a useful aid to researchers and developers to select the most adequate method for their needs.	https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9439930	0
UAVs-Aided Delay-Tolerant Blockchain Secure Offline Transactions in Post-Disaster Vehicular Networks	Vehicular networks which are paralyzed by natural disasters is faced with communication dilemma. Through building a decentralized communication network, unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) with high mobility and flexibility are expected to be the solution to the post-disaster vehicular networks. The blockchain technology has been widely used in UAV networks to provision the prompt security of distributed communications. However, existing works ignore the dynamics of the network in that due to high mobility, distributed UAVs cannot timely connect to the backbone to synchronize blockchain transactions. The delay of synchronization can result in severe security issues. On addressing the issues, this paper proposes UAVs-aided blockchain offline transactions to ensure the security and effectiveness of delay-tolerant blockchain transactions when UAVs are offline. In specific, we consider vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) charging transactions in post-disaster vehicular networks. By establishing offline channel between charging and discharging electric vehicles (EVs) by hashed time locked contract (HTLC), we design a UAVs aided penalty algorithm with accountable assertions to prevent deposit forging attacks and double-spending attacks. In addition, considering the selfishness of EVs, a Stackelberg game based incentive scheme is developed to encourage EVs to participate the offline transactions and to improve their trust values. By suing the mechanisms above, our proposal addresses the security of offline EV charging, as well as the selfishness of participant. Using extensive simulations, we demonstrate that the proposed scheme can realize secure transactions among EVs and can effectively improve the utilities of EVs through the comparison with conventional schemes.	https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9802738	0
Path Planning and Following Control of Autonomous Bus Under Time-Varying Parameters Against Parametric Uncertainties and External Disturbances	Path planning and path following are key technologies for autonomous vehicles. Strong nonlinearity, coupling characteristics, parametric uncertainties, external disturbances, and complicated driving scenarios put forward great challenges in estimation, control, and optimization of autonomous vehicles. Multi-dimension information utilization offers an effective solution to cope with the foregoing challenges. The presented research proposes a path planning and tracking framework for optimal design and regulation of control variables for collision avoidance and active guidance system, aiming to improve tracking performance and system robustness. For path planning approach, a virtual harmful potential field in 3 dimension (3D) is built to provide a collision-free trajectory as a reference path for path following, depending on vehicle kinematic model and boundary conditions of roads. A linear parameter-varying, polytopic vehicle lateral model is developed to address the issues of time-variable longitudinal speeds and preview distance on vehicle lateral stability management. Further, a strong robust gain-scheduling path following control approach based on linear matrix inequality methodology is proposed to tackle problems relating to characteristics of temporal variations, parametric uncertainties and external disturbances. Comparisons study under the TruckMaker/Xpack4-RapidECU joint HIL platform demonstrate that both tracking precision and high robustness to parametric uncertainties and external disturbances are superior than model predictive control method. The presented path following method provides an important insight into exploiting the robust control method's favorable merits while guaranteeing its computing efficiency.	https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9763348	0
Security Energy Efficiency Analysis of Analog Collaborative Beamforming With Stochastic Virtual Antenna Array of UAV Swarm	To extend the transmission range governed by limited transmit power, collaborative beamforming (CB) can be employed with a virtual antenna array (VAA) constructed by an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) swarm. CB techniques combined with physical layer security (PLS) algorithms are known to better secure transmissions of sensitive information in the presence of eavesdropping attacks, compared to co-located antenna-based schemes. In particular, analog collaborative beamforming (ACB) with random VAA topologies, which is suitable for UAV networks due to its lower signaling/channel estimation overhead compared to the digital CB, can provide a significantly higher secrecy rate by creating noise-like signals at eavesdroppers. However, the increase in energy consumption to improve secrecy rate had been ignored in the existing ACB-based PLS schemes, which is of paramount importance considering the limited onboard energy of UAVs. Thus, motivated by such limitation, in this paper, we examine the security energy efficiency of the ACB-based PLS technique, where a group of UAVs (or VAA elements) randomly change their locations in a distributed manner to randomize the array factor of the VAA, i.e., a stochastic VAA. The proposed stochastic VAA outperforms the existing static VAA in terms of secrecy energy efficiency as verified by analytic and numerical results. Further, the impact of phase errors of the proposed scheme is also presented, which indicates the significance of the accurate phase estimation.	https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9765707	0
Enhancing Feedback Steering Controllers for Autonomous Vehicles With Deep Monte Carlo Tree Search	Steering control is a vital function for autonomous vehicles, whose performance largely determines the driving safety. The widely used feedback steering controllers degrade significantly when vehicles drive at high speeds. This is mainly because these controllers can not effectively exploit nonlinear vehicle dynamics and future road information. Hence, the steering actions generated by these controllers can not achieve accurate and stable path tracking performance. To overcome this limitation, we propose a deep learning based Monte Carlo Tree Search (DeepMCTS) method to enhance the feedback controllers. Due to the accuracy of the learning-based model in characterizing nonlinear vehicle dynamics and the lookahead search ability of MCTS, the control performance of the feedback controllers can be enhanced significantly. Different from MPC methods, which leverage vehicle dynamics and future road information via online optimization, our method relies on the efficient tree search process. Hence, our method can avoid heavy computational burden. Testing results validate the proposed method can achieve better tracking accuracy and stability in high speeds scenarios.	https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9839405	0
AUV-Aided Data Importance Based Scheme for Protecting Location Privacy in Smart Ocean	Data collection in underwater acoustic sensor networks (UASNs) and the exposure of node location information pose a threat to the security of the entire network. Therefore, the main challenge for underwater acoustic sensor network security is to protect the security and privacy of the node locations. Compared to active attacks, the characteristics of passive attacks are indistinguishable. Therefore, this research focuses on passive attacks in underwater acoustic sensor networks, and an autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV)-aided data-importance-based scheme for protecting location privacy (DIS-PLP) is proposed. The DIS-PLP comprises three main parts. First, the anchor node calculates the importance of the current data based on the historical dataset and decides whether to send data packets to the base station according to the importance result. Subsequently, an AUV privacy violation is defined, and an AUV path planning method is proposed to prevent attackers from tracking the AUV to obtain the location of the source node. Finally, to prevent nodes from waiting too long for AUVs, a secure multi-hop transmission method is proposed that uses fake source nodes to send fake source data packets to hide the real traffic. The simulation results show that the DIS-PLP offers well performance in terms of safety time and delay, which has strong practical significance for Smart Ocean to improve the level of network security.	https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9783136	0
An Active Perception Framework for Autonomous Underwater Vehicle Navigation Under Sensor Constraints	Inertial navigation for autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs) is challenging because of the drift error caused by the noise and measurement errors of inertial sensors, typically packaged as an inertial measurement unit (IMU), integrated over time. To mitigate the drift error, recent AUV state estimation approaches incorporate external references or environmental information obtained from exteroceptive sensors, with increased costs and limited operational domains. For improved navigation under sensor constraints, this article proposes an active perception framework that exploits vehicle motion to estimate the flow state together with the vehicle state using IMU and depth sensors only. The proposed framework uses the estimated flow state as external information to improve vehicle state estimation. We construct a linear time-varying system for the flow state, separated from a nonlinear system for the vehicle state. This formulation allows us to analyze uniform complete observability for the flow state, which is found to depend on vehicle motion. Then, along with vehicle and flow state estimators, we design a vehicle controller to enable vehicle motion to maximize an information metric pertaining to estimation performance based on either observability or constructability Gramian for the flow state. The proposed framework is validated through simulations for a case study with a vehicle descending through the water column in a time-varying flow field. The effectiveness of the framework is demonstrated by comparing results obtained from its four implementations with those from baseline approaches without active perception.	https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9679478	0
A Survey on Attack Detection and Resilience for Connected and Automated Vehicles: From Vehicle Dynamics and Control Perspective	Recent advances in attack/anomaly detection and resilience strategies for connected and automated vehicles (CAVs) are reviewed from vehicle dynamics and control perspective. Compared to traditional vehicles, CAVs are featured in the increasing number of perception sensors, advanced intra-vehicle communication technologies, capabilities of driving automation and connectivity between single vehicles. These features bring about safety issues which are not encountered in traditional vehicle systems. One main type of these issues is the attack or anomaly launched onto the perception sensors and the communication channels. With such a consideration, this survey summarizes and reviews the existing results on attack/anomaly detection and resilience of CAVs in control frameworks. This paper reviews the results according to the positions at which the attacks/anomalies occur. These positions are divided into three categories, namely, intra-vehicle communication network, perception sensors and inter-vehicle communication network. From this perspective, the recent attack/anomaly detection and resilience results are reviewed according to different positions attacked. After reviewing existing results, some potential research directions and challenges are identified.	https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9809823	0
Continuous and Precise Positioning in Urban Environments by Tightly Coupled Integration of GNSS, INS and Vision	Accurate, continuous and seamless state estimation is the fundamental module for intelligent navigation applications, such as self-driving cars and autonomous robots. However, it is often difficult for a standalone sensor to fulfill the demanding requirements of precise navigation in complex scenarios. To fill this gap, this letter proposes to exploit the complementariness of the global navigation satellite system (GNSS), inertial measurement unit (IMU) and vision via a tightly coupled integration method, aiming to achieve continuous and accurate navigation in urban environments. Specifically, the raw GNSS carrier phase and pseudorange measurements, IMU data, and visual features are directly fused at the observation level through a centralized Extended Kalman Filter (EKF) to make full use of the multi-sensor information and reject potential outlier measurements. Furthermore, the widely used high-precision GNSS models including precise point positioning (PPP) and real-time kinematic (RTK) are unified in the proposed integrated system to increase usability and flexibility. We validate the performance of the proposed method on several challenging datasets collected in urban canyons and compare against the loosely coupled and state-of-the-art methods.	https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9866851	0
On the Achievability of Submeter-Accurate UAV Navigation With Cellular Signals Exploiting Loose Network Synchronization	A framework that could achieve submeter-level unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) horizontal navigation in multipath-free environments with cellular carrier phase measurements is developed. This framework exploits the “loose” synchronization between cellular base transceiver station (BTS) clocks. It is shown through extensive experimental data that the beat frequency stability of cellular BTSs approaches that of atomic standards and that the clock deviations can be realized as a stable autoregressive moving average model. This BTS clock model is referred to as loose network synchronization. A rule-of-thumb is established for clustering the clock deviations to minimize the position estimation error, while significantly reducing the computational complexity. The presented models allow the UAV to achieve sustained carrier phase-based meter- to submeter-accurate navigation. To demonstrate the efficacy of the developed framework, this article presents three UAV flight experiments in Southern California, USA, utilizing signals from different cellular providers transmitting at different frequencies. The three experiments took place in open, semiurban environments with nearly multipath-free, line-of-sight (LOS) conditions, in which the UAV traveled 1.72, 3.07, and 0.61 km, achieving a horizontal position root mean squared error of 36.61, 88.58, and 89.33 cm, respectively, with respect to the UAV’s on-board navigation system.	https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9745849	0
Collective Iterative Learning Control: Exploiting Diversity in Multi-Agent Systems for Reference Tracking Tasks	Multi-agent systems (MASs) can autonomously learn to solve previously unknown tasks by means of each agent’s individual intelligence as well as by collaborating and exploiting collective intelligence. This article considers a group of autonomous agents learning to track the same given reference trajectory in a possibly small number of trials. We propose a novel collective learning control method that combines iterative learning control (ILC) with a collective update strategy. We derive conditions for desirable convergence properties of such systems. We show that the proposed method allows the collective to combine the advantages of the agents’ individual learning strategies and thereby overcomes trade-offs and limitations of single-agent ILC. This benefit is achieved by designing a heterogeneous collective, i.e., a different learning law is assigned to each agent. All theoretical results are confirmed in simulations and experiments with two-wheeled-inverted-pendulum robots (TWIPRs) that jointly learn to perform the desired maneuver.	https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9537696	0
Event-Triggered Adaptive Formation Keeping and Interception Scheme for Autonomous Surface Vehicles Under Malicious Attacks	In leader-following formation, the leader plays a central role and is more vulnerable to malicious attacks. To effectively protect the leader, this article investigates an event-based formation control problem of autonomous surface vehicles (ASVs) with multiple attackers and actuator failure. A novel adaptive formation keeping and interception scheme is developed for ASVs. In this scheme, a formation keeping controller and an interception controller are designed under a unified framework by sharing same event-triggered mechanism and fault-tolerant structure. To bridge these two controllers, a degree and distance driven formation interception ($\text{D}^3$FI) strategy is designed by generating defenders. It is shown that with the proposed scheme, all attackers are intercepted without affecting formation keeping of remaining ASVs if the original topology is connected. Advantages of our scheme are: 1) stable controller switching is ensured during the formation cooperation and 2) the fault-tolerance is obtained with lower actuator updating frequencies and least number of adaptive parameters for each ASV.	https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9534686	0
Automated Design of Embedded Constraints for Soft Hands Enabling New Grasp Strategies	Soft robotic hands allow to fully exploit hand-object-environment interactions to complete grasping tasks. However, their usability can still be limited in some scenarios (e.g., restricted or cluttered spaces). In this article, we propose to enhance the versatility of soft grippers by adding special passive components to their structure, without completely altering their design, nor their control. A method for the automated design of soft-rigid scoop-shaped add-ons acting as “embedded constraints” is presented. Given a certain gripper and a large set of objects, the design parameters of the optimal scoop for each object are derived by solving an optimization problem. Also the object-environment relative pose is considered in the optimization. The obtained “optimal scoops” are clustered to get a limited set of representative scoop designs which can be prototyped and used in grasping tasks. In this article, we also introduce a data-driven method allowing a grasp planner to select the most suitable scoop to be added to the used hand, given a certain object and its configuration with respect to the surrounding environment. Experiments with two different hands validate the proposed approach.	https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9857591	0
Transmissibility-Based Health Monitoring of the Future Connected Autonomous Vehicles Networks	Transmissibility is a mathematical model that relates a subset of a system’s outputs to another subset of outputs of the same system without knowledge of the external excitation or the dynamics of the system. This study investigates fault detection, localization, and mitigation of connected autonomous vehicles (CAV) platoons using transmissibility operators. A CAV platoon is a network of connected autonomous vehicles that communicate together to move in a specific path with the desired velocity. Failure in a physical component of a vehicle, or failure in the form of an internal delay, a cyber-attack, or a communication time-delay affects the safety and security of the CAV platoons. In this paper, we use measurements from sensors available in CAV platoons to identify transmissibility operators, which are used for health monitoring, fault localization, and fault mitigation in the platoon. We first consider the case of vehicle-to-cloud communication (V2C) to monitor the platoon’s health. Then, we assume that the platoon loses communication with the cloud, and we monitor the health of the platoon based on vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) communication. We apply the proposed technique to a model of the platoon obtained using the bond graph approach, and an experimental setup consisting of three connected autonomous robots.	https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9713720	0
Secure Distributed Adaptive Platooning Control of Automated Vehicles Over Vehicular Ad-Hoc Networks Under Denial-of-Service Attacks	This article deals with the problem of secure distributed adaptive platooning control of automated vehicles over vehicular ad-hoc networks (VANETs) in the presence of intermittent denial-of-service (DoS) attacks. The platoon, which is wirelessly connected via directed vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) communication, is composed of a group of following vehicles subject to unknown heterogeneous nonlinearities and external disturbance inputs, and a leading vehicle subject to unknown nonlinearity and external disturbance as well as an unknown control input. Under such a platoon setting, this article aims to accomplish secure distributed platoon formation tracking with the desired longitudinal spacing and the same velocities and accelerations guided by the leader regardless of the simultaneous presence of nonlinearities, uncertainties, and DoS attacks. First, a new logical data packet processor is developed on each vehicle to identify the intermittent DoS attacks via verifying the time-stamps of the received data packets. Then, a scalable distributed neural-network-based adaptive control design approach is proposed to achieve secure platooning control. It is proved that under the established design procedure, the vehicle state estimation errors and platoon tracking errors can be regulated to reside in small neighborhoods around zero. Finally, comparative simulation studies are provided to substantiate the effectiveness and merits of the proposed control design approach on maintaining the desired platooning performance and attack tolerance.	https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9440748	0
Drone Detection Using Sparse Lidar Measurements	Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV) have been serving people, fulfilling various roles in research, industry and military, not to exclude personal entertainment. They have also been in use more often for malicious purposes, such as annoying neighbors, disrupting air-travel, attacking people or infrastructure. Therefore, motivated particularly by malicious uses, the research community has been interested in proposing solutions for detection of UAVs. In this work, we present a ground based aerial target detection system using lidars, relying on sparse detections rather than dense point clouds, with the aim of not only detecting but also estimating their motion and active tracking. We lay a theoretical groundwork to analyse the performance of such a lidar based detection system and help understanding its limitations. The work is complemented with field experiments utilizing a state-of-the-art lidar and several drones of different sizes, showing effectiveness in both detection and tracking using sparse measurements.	https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9691910	0
A Framework to Co-Optimize Robot Exploration and Task Planning in Unknown Environments	Robots often need to accomplish complex tasks in unknown environments, which is a challenging problem, involving autonomous exploration for acquiring necessary scene knowledge and task planning. In traditional approaches, the agent first explores the environment to instantiate a complete planning domain and then invokes a symbolic planner to plan and perform high-level actions. However, task execution is inefficient since the two processes involve many repetitive states and actions. Hence, this letter proposes a framework to co-optimize robot exploration and task planning in unknown environments. To afford robot exploration and symbolic planning not being independent and separated, we design a unified structure named subtask, which is exploited to decompose the robot exploration and planning phases. To select the appropriate subtask each time, we develop a value function and a value-based scheduler to co-optimize exploration and task processing. Our framework is evaluated in a photo-realistic simulator with three complex household tasks, increasing task efficiency by 25%–29%.	https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9919346	0
Safe Active Dynamics Learning and Control: A Sequential Exploration–Exploitation Framework	Safe deployment of autonomous robots in diverse scenarios requires agents that are capable of efficiently adapting to new environments while satisfying constraints. In this article, we propose a practical and theoretically justified approach to maintain safety in the presence of dynamics uncertainty. Our approach leverages Bayesian meta-learning with last-layer adaptation. The expressiveness of neural-network features trained offline, paired with efficient last-layer online adaptation, enables the derivation of tight confidence sets, which contract around the true dynamics as the model adapts online. We exploit these confidence sets to plan trajectories that guarantee the safety of the system. Our approach handles problems with high dynamics uncertainty, where reaching the goal safely is potentially initially infeasible, by first exploring to gather data and reduce uncertainty, before autonomously exploiting the acquired information to safely perform the task. Under reasonable assumptions, we prove that our framework guarantees the high-probability satisfaction of all constraints at all times jointly, i.e., over the total task duration. This theoretical analysis also motivates two regularizers of last-layer meta-learning models that improve online adaptation capabilities as well as performance by reducing the size of the confidence sets. We extensively demonstrate our approach in simulation and on hardware.	https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9767193	0
Guest Editorial Special Issue on Space-Air-Ground Integrated Networks for Intelligent Transportation Systems	Next-generation intelligent transportation systems (ITS) are envisioned to greatly improve transportation safety and efficiency by incorporating wireless communications and informatics technologies into transportation systems. As the cornerstone for ITS, vehicular communication networks enable vehicles on the go to exchange information with other vehicles and the external environments, which expect to play a significant role in supporting a variety of services such as road safety, traffic management, and infotainment. However, the existing terrestrial networks including dedicated shortrange communications (DSRC)-based networks and cellular networks alone cannot serve the vehicular applications very well in different scenarios, due to the inherent issues of deployment, coverage, and capacity. It is imperative to exploit other communication infrastructures, such as low-earth orbit (LEO) satellites, unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), and high-altitude platforms, to support vehicular applications better, resulting in space-air-ground integrated networks (SAGIN). SAGIN can provide more comprehensive and three-dimensional network connectivity for moving vehicles, anywhere and anytime, by exploiting their respective advantages in terms of coverage, flexibility, reliability, and availability.	https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9732628	0
Separate Control Strategy for a Biomimetic Gliding Robotic Fish	In this article, we present a novel separate strategy to control the pitch attitude and the gliding direction for a biomimetic gliding robotic fish by the coordination of the external and internal control surfaces. First, we derive the gliding dynamics and hydrodynamics within the framework of the extended angle of attack (AOA), based on which the gliding model is decomposed into pitch and velocity terms. Next, the backstepping and model predictive controllers are designed to regulate pitch angle using a movable mass and an AOA using pectoral fins based on their control features, respectively. Further, extensive simulations encompassing separate control and path following with desired pitch attitude are conducted to verify the feasibility and superiority of the proposed control strategy. More importantly, to capture the real-time gliding states in practical environment, we develop a gliding measurement and control system. Through the system, the aquatic experiments are carried out to further verify the effectiveness of the proposed separate control strategy. The obtained results offer valuable insight into the development of complex motion control of the gliding robots, laying a solid foundation for diversified underwater missions besides visual perception and autonomous docking.	https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9580482	0
Uncovering Interpretable Internal States of Merging Tasks at Highway on-Ramps for Autonomous Driving Decision-Making	Humans make daily routine decisions based on their internal states in intricate interaction scenarios. This article presents a probabilistically reconstructive learning approach to identify the internal states of multivehicle sequential interactions when merging at highway on-ramps. We treated the merging task’s sequential decision as a dynamic, stochastic process and then integrated the internal states into a hidden Markov model (HMM)-Gaussian mixture regression (GMR) model, a probabilistic combination of an extended GMR and HMM. We also developed a variant of the expectation–maximization (EM) algorithm to estimate the model parameters and verified it based on a real-world dataset. Experiment results reveal that three interpretable internal states can semantically describe the interactive merge procedure at highway on-ramps. This finding provides a basis for developing an efficient model-based decision-making algorithm for autonomous vehicles (AVs) in a partially observable environment. Note to Practitioners—Model-based learning approaches have obtained increasing attention in decision-making design due to their stability and interpretability. This article was built upon two facts: 1) intelligent agents can only receive partially observable environmental information directly through their equipped sensors in the real world and 2) humans mainly utilize the internal states and associated dynamics inferred from observations to make proper decisions in complex environments. Similarly, autonomous vehicles (AVs) need to understand, infer, anticipate, and exploit the internal states of dynamic environments. Applying probabilistic decision-making models to AVs requires updating the internal states’ beliefs and associated dynamics after getting new observations. The designed and verified emission model in hidden Markov model (HMM)-Gaussian mixture regression (GMR) provides a modifiable functional module for online updates of the associated internal states. Experiment results based on the real-world driving dataset demonstrate that the internal states extracted using HMM-GMR can represent the dynamic decision-making process semantically and make an accurate prediction.	https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9512609	0
On Social Interactions of Merging Behaviors at Highway On-Ramps in Congested Traffic	Merging at highway on-ramps while interacting with other human-driven vehicles is challenging for autonomous vehicles (AVs). An efficient route to this challenge requires exploring and exploiting knowledge of the interaction process from demonstrations by humans. However, it is unclear what information (or environmental states) is utilized by the human driver to guide their behavior throughout the whole merging process. This paper provides quantitative analysis and evaluation of the merging behavior at highway on-ramps with congested traffic in a volume of time and space. Two types of social interaction scenarios are considered based on the social preferences of surrounding vehicles: courteous and rude. The significant levels of environmental states for characterizing the interactive merging process are empirically analyzed based on the real-world INTERACTION dataset. Experimental results reveal two fundamental mechanisms in the merging process: 1) Human drivers select different states to make sequential decisions at different moments of task execution; and 2) the social preference of surrounding vehicles can impact variable selection for making decisions. It implies that efficient decision-making design should filter out irrelevant information while considering social preference to achieve comparable human-level performance. These essential findings shed light on developing new decision-making approaches for AVs.	https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9511791	0
GNSS-Imaging Data Fusion for Integrity Enhancement in Autonomous Vehicles	The transport sector is experiencing a fast and revolutionary development, moving toward the deployment of autonomous vehicles. Thus, the accuracy of the position information and the integrity of the navigation system have become key factors. In this article, we address the problem of the enhancement of the integrity of the position provided by a global navigation satellite system receiver by exploiting sensor fusion. To this aim, we estimate the lateral offset and heading of the vehicle with respect to a georeferenced roadway centerline from the images supplied by an on-board camera. Moreover, we perform integrity monitoring based on the implementation of the solution separation in the parity space. The numerical results indicate that the use of sensor fusion and digital map allows us to attain a longitudinal protection level reduction with respect to the case in which sensor fusion is not exploited. More specifically, a decrease of about 70% is achieved when a single constellation is used, while reduction is less relevant, about 15%, when two constellations are employed.	https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9754275	0
An Improved Dyna-Q Algorithm for Mobile Robot Path Planning in Unknown Dynamic Environment	This article deals with the problem of mobile robot path planning in an unknown environment that contains both static and dynamic obstacles, utilizing a reinforcement learning approach. We propose an improved Dyna- ${Q}$  algorithm, which incorporates heuristic search strategies, simulated annealing mechanism, and reactive navigation principle into  ${Q}$ -learning based on the Dyna architecture. A novel action-selection strategy combining  $\varepsilon $ -greedy policy with the cooling schedule control is presented, which, together with the heuristic reward function and heuristic actions, can tackle the exploration-exploitation dilemma and enhance the performance of global searching, convergence property, and learning efficiency for path planning. The proposed method is superior to the classical  ${Q}$ -learning and Dyna- ${Q}$  algorithms in an unknown static environment, and it is successfully applied to an uncertain environment with multiple dynamic obstacles in simulations. Further, practical experiments are conducted by integrating MATLAB and robot operating system (ROS) on a physical robot platform, and the mobile robot manages to find a collision-free path, thus fulfilling autonomous navigation tasks in the real world.	https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9495840	0
A Privacy-Preserving-Based Secure Framework Using Blockchain-Enabled Deep-Learning in Cooperative Intelligent Transport System	Cooperative Intelligent Transport System (C-ITS) is a promising technology that aims to improve the traditional transport management systems. In C-ITS infrastructure Autonomous Vehicles (AVs) communicate wirelessly with other AVs, Road Side Units (RSUs) and Traffic Command Centres (TCCs) using an open channel Internet. However, the use of the Internet brings inherent vulnerabilities related to privacy (e.g., adversary performing inference and data poisoning attacks), and security (e.g., AVs can be compromised using advanced hacking techniques) issues and prevents the faster realization of C-ITS applications. To address these challenges, this paper presents a privacy-preserving-based secure framework to provide both privacy and security in C-ITS infrastructure. The proposed framework provides two level of security and privacy using blockchain and deep learning modules. First, a blockchain module is designed to securely transmit the C-ITS data between AVs–RSUs-TCCs, and a smart contract-based enhanced Proof of Work (ePoW) technique is designed to verify data integrity and mitigate data poisoning attacks. Second, a deep-learning module is designed that includes Long-Short Term Memory-AutoEncoder (LSTM-AE) technique for encoding C-ITS data into a new format to prevent inference attacks. The encoded data is used by the proposed Attention-based Recurrent Neural Network (A-RNN), for intrusive events recognition in C-ITS infrastructure. The proposed A-RNN is trained using Truncated Backpropagation Through Time (BPTT) algorithm. The framework is further validated and tested using two publicly available ToN-IoT and CICIDS-2017 datasets. The proposed framework is compared with peer privacy-preserving intrusion detection techniques, and the result shows the effectiveness of the proposed framework over several state-of-the-art techniques in both blockchain and non-blockchain systems.	https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9505613	0
A Sensor Fusion-Based GNSS Spoofing Attack Detection Framework for Autonomous Vehicles	This paper presents a sensor fusion-based Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) spoofing attack detection framework for autonomous vehicles (AVs) that consists of two strategies: (i) comparison between predicted location shift—i.e., distance traveled between two consecutive timestamps—and inertial sensor based location shift in addition to monitoring of vehicle motion states—i.e., standstill/ in motion; and (ii) detection and classification of turns (left or right) along with detection of vehicle motion states. In the first strategy, data from low-cost in-vehicle inertial sensors—i.e., speedometer, accelerometer, and steering angle sensor—are fused and fed to a long short-term memory (LSTM) neural network to predict the distance an AV will travel between two consecutive timestamps. The second strategy combines k-Nearest Neighbors (k-NN) and Dynamic Time Warping (DTW) algorithms to detect a turn and then classify left and right turns using steering angle sensor output. In both strategies, the GNSS-derived speed is compared with speedometer output to improve the effectiveness of the framework presented in this paper. To prove the efficacy of the sensor fusion-based attack detection framework, attack datasets are created for four unique spoofing attack scenarios—turn-by-turn, overshoot, wrong turn, and stop, using the publicly available real-world Honda Research Institute Driving Dataset (HDD). Analyses conducted in this study reveal that the sensor fusion-based detection framework successfully detects all four types of spoofing attacks within the required computational latency threshold.	https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9868262	0
Adversarial Swarm Defence Using Multiple Fixed-Wing Unmanned Aerial Vehicles	This article proposes a coverage-based adversarial swarm defence algorithm. The defender swarm composed of fixed-wing unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) is assumed to have explosives onboard to intercept an adversarial swarm. The proposed approach consists of the following two steps: first, impact point optimization and, second, model predictive control (MPC)-based impact time control. The impact point optimization periodically optimizes impact points for the corresponding UAVs to maximize the coverage within the hostile swarm while minimizing the common impact time. The optimization domain is limited to a physically reachable area of UAVs with the common impact time. Besides, the MPC-based impact time controller is designed to ensure the multiple UAVs to arrive the generated time-varying impact points simultaneously. Numerical simulations are performed to prove the feasibility and efficiency of the proposed swarm defence algorithm.	https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9761772	0
Secure Content Delivery for Connected and Autonomous Trucks: A Coalition Formation Game Approach	With the ever-increasing demand for the content delivery services in autonomous vehicular networks (AVNs), caching popular contents in the edge nodes in advance is expected to reduce the transmission delay. Current works on the contents cached in connected and autonomous vehicles (CAVs) or roadside units (RSUs) are facing the problems of limited caching size and high deployment cost. In this paper, by exploiting the advantages of high caching space and flexibility of truck platoons composed of connected and autonomous trucks (CATs), we propose a secure content delivery service for CATs based on coalition formation game. Firstly, in order to protect the security and privacy of content delivery services, a differential privacy model is proposed to protect the sensitive information of CATs. Meanwhile, the differential privacy model is combined with the incentive based trust evaluation model to monitor the behaviors of CATs. In the incentive based models, CATs are encouraged to improve their trust values to obtain higher utilities and find a balance between confidence levels and utilities. Moreover, a coalition formation game is established among CATs with the same driving route, in which all CATs can maximize their utilities with the formation of several minor coalitions. Finally, we conduct extensive simulations to demonstrate the effectiveness and superiority of the proposed scheme.	https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9899365	0
Information-Theoretic Online Multi-Camera Extrinsic Calibration	Calibration of multi-camera systems is essential for lifelong use of vision-based headsets and autonomous robots. In this work, we present an information-based framework for online extrinsic calibration of multi-camera systems. While previous work largely focuses on monocular, stereo, or strictly non-overlapping field-of-view (FoV) setups, we allow arbitrary configurations while also exploiting overlapping pairwise FoV when possible. In order to efficiently solve for the extrinsic calibration parameters, which increase linearly with the number of cameras, we propose a novel entropy-based keyframe measure and bound the backend optimization complexity by selecting informative motion segments that minimize the maximum entropy across all extrinsic parameter partitions. We validate the pipeline on three distinct platforms to demonstrate the generality of the method for resolving the extrinsics and performing downstream tasks. Our code is available at <uri>https://github.com/edexheim/info_ext_calib</uri>.	https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9691878	0
Blockchain-Integrated Multiagent Deep Reinforcement Learning for Securing Cooperative Adaptive Cruise Control	Connected and Autonomous Vehicles (CAVs) are an emerging solution to the issues of safe and sustainable transportation systems in the future. One major transport technology for CAVs is Cooperative Adaptive Cruise Control (CACC), for which unsignalized autonomous intersection crossing is a growing use case. CACC relies heavily on inter-vehicular communication and is thus vulnerable to message forgery and jamming attacks. Most solutions for CACC focus exclusively on enhancing efficiency or security but do not offer an integrated framework for achieving both on a large scale. In this paper, we propose a Blockchain-integrated Multi-Agent Deep Reinforcement Learning (Block-MADRL) architecture for enhancing the efficiency of CACC while cooperatively detecting attacks, reducing the fuel efficiency of identified attackers and securely notifying the overall network. Our approach uses multi-agent deep reinforcement learning to find fuel and throughput optimizing solutions for CACC and a cooperative verification mechanism based on Extended Isolation Forest (EIF) for attack detection. Attacker data is securely stored in a Road Side Unit (RSU) level blockchain, and we design a low-latency, high throughput consensus protocol for speedy and secure data dissemination. Simulation results indicate over 29.5% better lane throughput with our approach during acceleration forgery attack, up to 23% induced reduction in fuel efficiency of malicious vehicles, 17.6% higher blockchain throughput through our consensus protocol and over 8% improvement in attack detection rate compared to the state-of-the-art.	https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9765784	0
A Novel Inertial-Aided Visible Light Positioning System Using Modulated LEDs and Unmodulated Lights as Landmarks	Indoor localization with high accuracy and efficiency has attracted much attention. Due to visible light communication (VLC), the LED lights in buildings, once modulated, hold great potential to be ubiquitous indoor localization infrastructure. However, this entails retrofitting the lighting system and is hence costly in wide adoption. To alleviate this problem, we propose to exploit modulated LEDs and existing unmodulated lights as landmarks. On this basis, we present a novel inertial-aided visible light positioning (VLP) system for lightweight indoor localization on resource-constrained platforms, such as service robots and mobile devices. With blob detection, tracking, and VLC decoding on rolling-shutter camera images, a visual front end extracts two types of blob features, i.e., mapped landmarks (MLs) and opportunistic features (OFs). These are tightly fused with inertial measurements in a stochastic cloning sliding-window extended Kalman filter (EKF) for localization. We evaluate the system by extensive experiments. The results show that it can provide lightweight, accurate, and robust global pose estimates in real time. Compared with our previous ML-only inertial-aided VLP solution, the proposed system has superior performance in terms of positional accuracy and robustness under challenging light configurations, such as sparse ML/OF distribution. Note to Practitioners—This article is motivated by the problem that many existing visible light positioning (VLP) systems require high-cost environmental modifications, i.e., replacing a large portion of original lights with modulated LEDs as beacons. To reduce costs in wide adoption, we seek to use fewer modulated LEDs if possible. Accordingly, we present a novel inertial-aided VLP system that uses both modulated LEDs and unmodulated lights as landmarks. Like in other VLP systems, the successfully decoded LEDs provide absolute pose measurements for global localization. Unmodulated lights and the LEDs with decoding failures provide relative motion constraints, allowing the reduction of pose drift during the outage of modulated LEDs. Due to the tightly coupled sensor fusion by filtering, the system can provide efficient and accurate localization when modulated LEDs are sparse. The system is lightweight to run on resource-constrained platforms. For practical deployment of our system at scale, creating LED maps accurately and efficiently remains a problem. It is desired to develop automated LED mapping solutions in future work.	https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9569214	0
Any-Time Feasible Coordination for Multivehicle Systems	This article proposes a distributed control methodology for the coordination of multiple connected and automated vehicles (CAVs). Each vehicle computes its local trajectory based on a model predictive control (MPC) law and communicates the result with other relevant vehicles. In an iterative negotiation process, planned trajectories are optimized within a sampling time step. Inspired by the Jacobi over-relaxation (JOR) algorithm, we develop a distributed Jacobi over-relaxation algorithm (DJOR) for vehicle coordination. The modified algorithm exploits the structure of the distributed problem setting in which coupling occurs only in a bilateral way. Besides being able to guarantee any-time feasibility that implies collision-freeness, the algorithm scales well, unlike the standard JOR algorithm. The DJOR algorithm allows for significantly less conservatism in the choice of the update weightings. As a result, much faster convergence rates can be expected. Furthermore, the collision avoidance guarantee is extended for unforeseen scenarios such as emergency braking. Using an exact penalty function formulation ensures that the distributed optimization problem remains feasible even in previously unforeseen cases. Numerical simulations of an intersection crossing scenario illustrate the presented approach and show its benefits in comparison with standard traffic rules and a centralized computation.	https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9612059	0
Safety of Automatic Emergency Braking in Platooning	A platoon comprises a string of consecutive highly automated vehicles traveling together. Platooning allows for increased road utilization and reduced fuel consumption due to short inter-vehicular distances. Safety in terms of guaranteeing no rear-end collisions is of utmost importance for platooning systems to be deployed in practice. We compare how safely emergency braking can be handled by emerging vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) communications on the one hand and by radar-based measurements of existing automatic emergency braking systems (AEBS) on the other. We show that even under conservative assumptions on the V2V communications, such an approach significantly outperforms AEBS with an ideal radar sensor in terms of allowed inter-vehicle distances and response times. Furthermore, we design two emergency braking strategies for platooning based on V2V communications. The first braking strategy assumes centralized coordination by the leading vehicle and exploits necessary optimal conditions of a constrained optimization problem, whereas the second – the more conservative solution – assumes only local information and is distributed in nature. Both strategies are also compared with the AEBS.	https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9664486	0
A Survey on Cyber-Security of Connected and Autonomous Vehicles (CAVs)	As the general development trend of the automotive industry, connected and autonomous vehicles (CAVs) can be used to increase transportation safety, promote mobility choices, reduce user costs, and create new job opportunities. However, with the increasing level of connectivity and automation, malicious users are able to easily implement different kinds of attacks, which threaten the security of CAVs. Hence, this paper provides a comprehensive survey on the cyber-security in the environment of CAVs with the aim of highlighting security problems and challenges. Firstly, based on the types of communication networks and attack objects, it classifies various cyber-security risks and vulnerabilities in the environment of CAVs into in-vehicle network attacks, vehicle to everything network attacks, and other attacks. Next, it regards cyber-risk as another type of attacks in the environment of CAVs. Then, it describes and analyzes up-to-date corresponding defense strategies for securing CAVs. In addition, it concludes several available cyber-security and safety standards of CAVs, which is helpful for the practical application of CAVs. Finally, several challenges and open problems are discussed for the future research.	https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9447840	0
Game Theoretic Physical Layer Authentication for Spoofing Detection in UAV Communications	In this paper, we propose a game theoretic framework for secure physical layer authentication (PLA) by applying the spatial correlations of received signal strength (RSS) in the air-to-ground channels between an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV), a legitimate transmitter, and a spoofer. Based on our hypothesis model, we first derive the false alarm rate and miss detection rate for the UAV receiver. We then formulate a zero-sum PLA game where the UAV receiver selects its RSS detection threshold while the spoofer selects its attack probability to maximize their respective utilities. We derive the Nash equilibrium (NE) and its existence condition for the proposed PLA game. Monte Carlo simulation results accurately verify our analytical expressions for the false alarm rate and miss detection rate. Numerical results highlight the complex interplay between the detection threshold, spoofing attack probability and UAV altitude in the derived NE.	https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9739860	0
EchoVPR: Echo State Networks for Visual Place Recognition	Recognising previously visited locations is an important, but unsolved, task in autonomous navigation. Current visual place recognition (VPR) benchmarks typically challenge models to recover the position of a query image (or images) from sequential datasets that include both spatial and temporal components. Recently, Echo State Network (ESN) varieties have proven particularly powerful at solving machine learning tasks that require spatio-temporal modelling. These networks are simple, yet powerful neural architectures that&#x2014;exhibiting memory over multiple time-scales and non-linear high-dimensional representations&#x2014;can discover temporal relations in the data while still maintaining linearity in the learning time. In this letter, we present a series of ESNs and analyse their applicability to the VPR problem. We report that the addition of ESNs to pre-processed convolutional neural networks led to a dramatic boost in performance in comparison to non-recurrent networks in five out of six standard benchmarks (GardensPoint, SPEDTest, ESSEX3IN1, Oxford RobotCar, and Nordland), demonstrating that ESNs are able to capture the temporal structure inherent in VPR problems. Moreover, we show that models that include ESNs can outperform class-leading VPR models which also exploit the sequential dynamics of the data. Finally, our results demonstrate that ESNs improve generalisation abilities, robustness, and accuracy further supporting their suitability to VPR applications.	https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9712237	0
Resilient Cooperative Adaptive Cruise Control for Autonomous Vehicles Using Machine Learning	Cooperative Adaptive Cruise Control (CACC) is a fundamental connected vehicle application that extends Adaptive Cruise Control by exploiting vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) communication. CACC is a crucial ingredient for numerous autonomous vehicle functionalities including platooning, distributed route management, etc. Unfortunately, malicious V2V communications can subvert CACC, leading to string instability and road accidents. In this paper, we develop a novel resiliency infrastructure, RACCON, for detecting and mitigating V2V attacks on CACC. RACCON uses machine learning to develop an on-board prediction model that captures anomalous vehicular responses and performs mitigation in real time. RACCON-enabled vehicles can exploit the high efficiency of CACC without compromising safety, even under potentially adversarial scenarios. We present extensive experimental evaluation to demonstrate the efficacy of RACCON.	https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9700787	0
Adversarial Game Against Hybrid Attacks in UAV Communications With Partial Information	Unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) communications are vulnerable to smart attacks, where the attacker can change the attack mode (e.g., eavesdropping and jamming) via smart radio devices. To ensure secure transmissions against hybrid attacks, UAVs may transmit confidential information and misleading information alternately. In this paper, we consider a dynamic anti-hybrid attack framework with trajectory optimization, where both a UAV and an attacker attempt to find their optimal trajectories without knowing the information type and the attack mode of each other. Given the major challenge due to incomplete knowledge (i.e., each agent knows only its own information), we establish an adversarial game with partial-observation feature to formulate an optimization problem, and propose a counterfactual regret minimization learning scheme to achieve the correlated equilibrium for both the UAV and attacker. Simulation results validate the superiority of our scheme over a benchmark in UAV communication scenarios with partial information.	https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9640491	0
SLAP-IoD: Secure and Lightweight Authentication Protocol Using Physical Unclonable Functions for Internet of Drones in Smart City Environments	With the emergence of the concept of smart city and the increasing demands for a range of drones, Internet of Drones (IoD) has achieved a variety of attention by providing multiple benefits in academia and industry. IoD offers numerous services, such as traffic monitoring, environmental monitoring, and disaster management by combining infrastructure, Internet of Things (IoT), and Flying Ad-Hoc Networks (FANET) in smart city environments. However, communication among drones is vulnerable to potential security threats because the sensitive messages in various applications are exchanged via an insecure channel in IoD-based smart city environments. Since IoDs can be operated in unattended environment with minimum human interventions, smart devices (e.g., drones and sensors) deployed in IoD architectures are vulnerable to physical capture attacks. In addition, drones are resource-constrained in terms of computation and communication overheads, and it is not much viable to apply public key cryptography (PKC) that requires high computation and communication overheads. Thus, we design a secure and lightweight authentication protocol using a physical unclonable function (PUF) for IoD to guarantee reliable and useful services in smart city environments, called SLAP-IoD. We prove the security of the SLAP-IoD using informal and formal security analyses using the broadly recognized Real-Or-Random (ROR) random oracle model, and also through the formal security verification using the widely-accepted Automated Validation of Internet Security-sensitive Protocols and Applications (AVISPA) security verification. Furthermore, we compare the performance of the SLAP-IoD with related schemes. Consequently, we show that SLAP-IoD offers better security and efficiency than other related schemes and is suitable for IoD-based smart city environments.	https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9816023	0
OpenStreetMap-Based Autonomous Navigation With LiDAR Naive-Valley-Path Obstacle Avoidance	OpenStreetMaps (OSM) is currently studied as the environment representation for autonomous navigation. It provides advantages such as global consistency, a heavy-less map construction process, and a wide variety of road information publicly available. However, the location of this information is usually not very accurate locally. In this paper, we present a complete autonomous navigation pipeline using OSM information as environment representation for global planning. To avoid the flaw of local low-accuracy, we offer the novel LiDAR-based Naive-Valley-Path (NVP) method that exploits the concept of “valley” areas to infer the local path always furthest from obstacles. This behavior allows navigation always through the center of trafficable areas following the road’s shape independently of OSM error. Furthermore, NVP is a naive method that is highly sample-time-efficient. This time efficiency also enables obstacle avoidance, even for dynamic objects. We demonstrate the system’s robustness in our research platform BLUE, driving autonomously across the University of Alicante Scientific Park for more than 20 km with 0.24 meters of average error against the road’s center with a 19.8 ms of average sample time. Our vehicle avoids static obstacles in the road and even dynamic ones, such as vehicles and pedestrians.	https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9906811	0
Fast-HBNet: Hybrid Branch Network for Fast Lane Detection	As one of the fundamental visual tasks in the unmanned driving area, lane detection attracts increasing attention. In practical applications, lane points are very difficult to localize because they usually appear to be sparse and incomplete due to the influence of illumination and environment. Conventional lane detection methods rely on coarse features and carefully designed postprocessing to detect the lane lines. However, these methods are usually slow, and the stability and generalization ability are unsatisfactory. In this paper, we propose a novel lane detection network – Fast-HBNet(Fast-Hybrid Branch Network), which exploits both global semantic information and spatial contexts. To enlarge receptive fields and encode more detailed information, the compound transformation is employed and the proposed hybrid branch network extracts four diverse feature maps with different receptive fields and spatial contexts. Besides, we design a Hierarchical Feature Learning (HFL) module to learn lane features from the scale, channel, and spatial levels to enhance the generalization ability of our detector. These features are further selectively coalesced to generate unified lane feature maps with large receptive fields and rich detailed information. In other words, our network can encode the global semantic information from the high-resolution feature maps and the fine-grained details in the low-resolution feature maps. Experimental results conducted on the TuSimple (2017) and CULane [Pan et al. (2018)] datasets demonstrate that the proposed Fast-HBNet outperforms numerous state-of-the-art lane detectors in both speed and accuracy. Particularly, Fast-HBNet achieves an accuracy of 96.88% on the TuSimple dataset at a speed of 76 FPS.	https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9700773	0
Detection of False Data Injection Attack in Connected and Automated Vehicles via Cloud-Based Sandboxing	In recent years, developments in vehicle-to-everything communication (V2X) have steadily increased in applications such as platooning and collision avoidance. V2X provides vehicles with long-range information regarding traffic congestion and routing, but also short and mid-range information allowing cooperative adaptive cruise control, automatic collision warnings, and others. Despite being potentially beneficial in several aspects, such interdependence poses a set of specific challenges from safety and reliability standpoint due to the possibility of cyber-attacks aimed at influencing the behavior of the vehicles. In this paper, a Cloud-based approach, a sandboxing framework is presented to detect the false data injection attack on connected and automated vehicles (CAVs). The sandboxing concept comes from computer security and it is adopted in a control framework as a way to isolate and evaluate the data exchanged by the CAVs affecting the vehicle control system. Numerical experiments are conducted to show the effectiveness of the approach using microscopic traffic simulation. Simulation results show that our proposed methodology is able to detect the false data injection attack existing in the V2X communication and identify the attacker in real-time less than 0.2 s.	https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9463871	0
Analysis of ID Sequences Similarity Using DTW in Intrusion Detection for CAN Bus	Connected vehicles have recently attracted considerable attention for revolutionizing the transportation industry. Although connectivity brings about a vast number of benefits, it can give rise to a wider attack surface as more physical access interfaces have been introduced. In particular, anomalous behaviour of the Electronic Control Units (ECUs) caused by malicious attacks can result in serious consequences and possibly lead to fatal accidents. Hence, it is important to develop methodologies that can sniff vehicular data and detect it for further attack analysis. In this article, we develop a novel similarity-based intrusion detection methodology named SIDuDTW, which identifies malicious messages inside vehicle network, e.g., Controller Area Network (CAN), by using Dynamic Time Warping (DTW) distance between CAN ID sequences. Subsequently, the theoretical analysis for the recurring sequence pattern, wave splitting strategies, similarity metric, and optimal parameters providing strong robustness against several kinds of attacks in SIDuDTW are detailed. A series of experiments demonstrate that the developed methodology can detect attacks with high accuracy. In addition, this proposed methodology significantly outperforms the intrusion detection capabilities of existing approaches in terms of basic injection, replay and suppression attacks. It is envisioned that this work will contribute to the development of safer autonomous vehicle conceptualized as a key unit within broader smart city.	https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9808189	0
E3MoP: Efficient Motion Planning Based on Heuristic-Guided Motion Primitives Pruning and Path Optimization With Sparse-Banded Structure	To solve the autonomous navigation problem in complex environments, an efficient motion planning approach is newly presented in this paper. Considering the challenges from large-scale, partially unknown complex environments, a three-layer motion planning framework is elaborately designed, including global path planning, local path optimization, and time-optimal velocity planning. Compared with existing approaches, the novelty of this work is twofold: 1) a novel heuristic-guided pruning strategy of motion primitives is proposed and fully integrated into the state lattice-based global path planner to further improve the computational efficiency of graph search, and 2) a new soft-constrained local path optimization approach is proposed, wherein the sparse-banded system structure of the underlying optimization problem is fully exploited to efficiently solve the problem. We validate the safety, smoothness, flexibility, and efficiency of our approach in various complex simulation scenarios and challenging real-world tasks. It is shown that the computational efficiency is improved by 66.21% in the global planning stage and the motion efficiency of the robot is improved by 22.87% compared with the recent quintic Bézier curve-based state space sampling approach. We name the proposed motion planning framework E  $\mathbf {^{3}} $ MoP, where the number 3 not only means our approach is a three-layer framework but also means the proposed approach is efficient in three stages. Note to Practitioners—This paper is motivated by the challenges of motion planning problems of mobile robots. A three-layer motion planning framework is proposed by combining global path planning, local path optimization, and time-optimal velocity planning. For mobile robot navigation applications in semi-structured environments, optimization-based local planners are recommended. Extensive simulation and experimental results show the effectiveness of the proposed motion planning framework. However, due to the non-convexity of the path optimization formulation, the proposed local planner may get stuck in local optima. In future research, we will concentrate on extending the proposed local path optimization approach with the theory of homology classes to maintain several homotopically distinct local paths and seek global optima.	https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9627934	0
A Survey of Attacks on Controller Area Networks and Corresponding Countermeasures	The development of vehicle technologies such as connected and autonomous vehicle environments provide drivers with functions for convenience and safety that are highly capable of remote vehicle diagnosis or lane-keeping assistance. Unfortunately, despite impressive advantages for drivers, these functions also have various vulnerabilities that could lead to cyber-physical attacks on automotive Controller Area Networks (i.e., automotive CAN). To deal with these security issues, a multitude of issue-specific countermeasures have already been proposed. In this paper, we introduce existing research on automotive CAN attacks and evaluate several state-of-the-art countermeasures. Particularly, we provide a comprehensive adversary model for automotive CAN and classify existing countermeasures into four system categories: (1) preventative protection, (2) intrusion detection, (3) authentication, and (4) post-protection. From the extensive literature review, we attempt to summarize the security research regarding automotive CAN and identify open research directions for in-vehicle networks of autonomous vehicle.	https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9439954	0
Coordinated Cognitive Risk Control for Bridging Vehicular Radar and Communication Systems	As an essential part of the emerging Internet of Things, connected and autonomous vehicles (CAVs) have the potential to reshape future transportation systems and change the commute style in people’s everyday life. Among many vehicular on-board devices, radar system and vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) communication system are two important pillars for the realization of CAVs. In this paper, the concept of coordinated CRC (C-CRC) is proposed to serve as a cognitive mediator for bridging vehicular radar and communication systems. By establishing a mutual-assistance relationship, C-CRC provides a new safety mechanism that allows one system to learn from and react to the risks that the other system has encountered. Simulation results have shown that the proposed method has desirable performance in face of motion perturbation and/or jamming attack under various scenarios.	https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9292428	0
Valve Detection for Autonomous Water Pipeline Inspection Platform	Water distribution and transmission lines are indispensable to urban infrastructure. The water pipelines are subject to both structural and functional deterioration due to various reasons including aging, negligence, and high demand for water supply. Hence, to ensure a safe and reliable water supply, the water utilities need to perform routine pipe condition assessment. The condition assessment is usually carried out by visual inspection with the machine vision system carried by a robotic platform. The inspection platforms will capture the internal condition of the water pipelines in a video stream. However, the robotic platform frequently experiences difficulties while traversing through the valves installed along the pipeline. This inhibits and disrupts the inspection process of the water pipelines. Therefore, this article proposes a deep learning-based automatic valve detection framework to facilitate the robot’s navigation and ensure continuous inspection without any interruptions. The valve detection model is developed by combining MobileNet-160 and Feature Pyramid Network and is named as MFPN. The developed framework also employs a generative adversarial network to solve the sparse dataset issues and improve the generality of the framework. The comparative study and ablation analyses demonstrate that the proposed framework can achieve a higher mAP value of 89.11% in comparison with the state of the art. Hence, this light weight and efficient solution can be deployed to the robotic platform for real-time valve detection and enable autonomous navigation of the robotic platform for condition assessment of water pipelines.	https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9429956	0
Automatic Detection and Counting System for Pavement Cracks Based on PCGAN and YOLO-MF	The regular detection of pavement cracks is critical for life and property security. However, existing deep learning-based methods of crack detection face difficulties in terms of data acquisition and defect counting. An automatic intelligent detection and tracking system for pavement cracks is proposed. Our system is formed of a pavement crack generative adversarial network (PCGAN) and a crack detection and tracking network called YOLO-MF. First, PCGAN is used to generate realistic crack images, to address the problem of the small number of available images. Next, YOLO-MF is developed based on an improved YOLO v3 modified by an acceleration algorithm and median flow (MF) algorithm to count the number of cracks. In a counting loop, our improved YOLO v3 detects cracks and the MF algorithm tracks the cracks detected in a video. This improved algorithm achieves the best accuracy of 98.47% and F1 score of 0.958 among other algorithms, and the precision-recall curve was close to the top right. A tiny model was developed and an acceleration algorithm was applied, which improved the detection speed by factors of five and six, respectively. In on-site measurement, three cracks were detected and tracked, and the total count was correct. Finally, the system was embedded in an intelligent device consisting of a calculating module, an automated unmanned aerial vehicle, and other components.	https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9745793	0
A Secure Dynamic Mix Zone Pseudonym Changing Scheme Based on Traffic Context Prediction	Traffic context plays an important role in supporting automated driving and intelligent transportation systems. Smart vehicles explore surrounding environments by analyzing sensor data and periodically communicating with neighbors and road infrastructures. The context can be well learned in this way to support driving, but the vehicle trajectory can be also easily exposed under eavesdropping attacks. The pseudonym is proposed to hide the real identity of the vehicles. However, the effectiveness of anonymity, the safety of driving, the convenience of implementation and the utilization of resources in previous approaches have not been well-balanced. Therefore, focusing on efficiently replacing pseudonyms with the premise of ensuring driving safety, we propose a secure dynamic silent mix zone pseudonym changing scheme (TLAS) based on the real-time traffic context prediction for urban regions. It naturally takes the area in front of the red traffic light as a silent mix zone, which avoids the driving security issue caused by signal silence. Besides, the area length is dynamically configured according to the traffic context predicted in the last green light cycle, so the anonymous effect can be improved. In addition, considering the resource utilization and accuracy requirement, the adaptive prediction algorithm is applied. We conduct simulation experiments with real-world traffic history using SUMO and OMNET++, the results show that TLAS strategy can indeed achieve a better anonymous effect (reducing standardized traceability rate by 8.2%) with lower driving speed for safety concern.	https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9613820	0
Guaranteed Collision-Free Reference Tracking in Constrained Multi Unmanned Vehicle Systems	In this article, we face the reference tracking control problem for a system of heterogeneous multiple unmanned vehicles (MUVs) moving in a 2-D planar environment. We consider a scenario, where each vehicle follows a trajectory imposed by a local planner and where each unmanned vehicle can have different linear dynamics as well as different constraints and disturbances. In this contest, we design a novel control architecture, where a centralized traffic manager, in conjunction with ad-hoc designed local vehicle controllers, is capable of ensuring the absence of collisions. The proposed solution is obtained by exploiting, for the local vehicles’ controllers, a dual-mode model-predictive controller and, for the traffic manager, set-theoretic and controllability properties. Moreover, after modeling the potential vehicle collisions with a graph, connectivity arguments are used to obtain an optimal collision resolution, which minimizes the number of vehicles that need to be stopped. The resulting control scheme ensures collision-free signal tracking. Results of the simulation conducted on an MUV system are shown to provide tangible evidence of the features of the proposed framework.	https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9468311	0
A Heuristic Distributed Scheme to Detect Falsification of Mobility Patterns in Internet of Vehicles	Autonomous vehicles in the Internet of Vehicles (IoV) have the ability to generate their mobility pattern in advance and share it with other vehicles or a central location. This information enables traffic systems to be aware of future traffic flow. However, the current classical traffic systems barely consider the spatial dependency of traffic data, and more advanced systems suffer from storage limitations. These problems will be exacerbated by the falsification of traffic data through corresponding data attacks, such as position forging attacks. This, in turn, negatively impacts the performance of traffic management systems. This article proposes a heuristic distributed scheme (HIDE) to validate the mobility pattern of vehicles by penalizing or rewarding vehicles based on the contacts’ conformation. HIDE enables every vehicle to consider the claimed mobility pattern of every neighboring vehicle that is exchanged, and assigns a penalty or reward to each received mobility pattern and share with cloudlets via roadside units (RSUs). These calculations are based on an efficient time-homogeneous semi-Markov process (THSMP) to predict the likelihood of the accuracy of mobility patterns. Cloudlets calculate a weight factor to determine if a vehicle is malicious. The validation results from THSMP reveal that a high correlation is achieved between the theoretical model and simulation. Also, the results show that the model fairly identifies the malicious vehicles and assigns a low weight of impact on them compared to normal vehicles.	https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9445064	0
Cyber Attack Detection and Isolation for a Quadrotor UAV With Modified Sliding Innovation Sequences	Common vulnerabilities in typical intelligent cyber-physical systems such as unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) can be easily exploited by cyber attackers to cause serious accidents and harm. For successful UAV operations, security against cyber attacks is imperative. In this paper, we propose a modified sliding innovation sequences (MSIS) detector, based on the extended Kalman filter optimal state estimation, for a dynamic quadrotor system to detect cyber attacks inflicted on both its actuators and sensors in real time. These cyber attacks include random attacks, false data injection (FDI) attacks and denial-of-service (DoS) attacks. The MSIS detector computes the operator norm of the normalized innovation (residual) sequence within a sliding time window and triggers the alarm if the value is above the preset threshold. For a quadrotor undergoing rapid turns in a complex trajectory, the detector observes a reduced false alarm rate as compared to other state estimation-based detectors. To address the initial estimation error problem, we implement an iteration procedure to initiate and calibrate the detector. By evaluating the sample covariance of the normalized innovation sequence, the MSIS detector has the capability to isolate cyber attacks. Finally, simulation results of a quadrotor in a periodic, complex trajectory flight are provided to verify the effectiveness of the MSIS detection and isolation method.	https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9764628	0
SHOTS: Scalable Secure Authentication-Attestation Protocol Using Optimal Trajectory in UAV Swarms	Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) have enabled a broad spectrum of applications serving social, commercial, and military purposes. However, since UAVs use wireless communication technologies, they are highly vulnerable to security threats. Establishing trust with the base station is the most fundamental security aspect in UAV networks to mitigate these threats. However, due to a UAV’s constrained resources, deploying traditional trust establishment schemes in UAV networks becomes challenging. Further, this issue escalates as the number of UAVs increases. To address this issue, we propose an authentication cum attestation protocol for UAV swarms using an optimal communication trajectory, which can establish the required trust in a lightweight manner. Furthermore, our protocol uses Physical Unclonable Functions (PUFs) and thus guarantees physical security as well. We demonstrate that the proposed protocol is feasible, scalable, and secure using a formal Mao Boyd logic approach. Comparative analyses show that the proposed protocol outperforms the state-of-the-art.	https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9743804	0
An Enhanced Multi-Stage Deep Learning Framework for Detecting Malicious Activities From Autonomous Vehicles	Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS), particularly Autonomous Vehicles (AVs), are susceptible to safety and security concerns that impend people’s lives. Nothing like manually controlled vehicles, the safekeeping of communications and computing constituents of AVs can be threatened using sophisticated hacking techniques, consequently disrupting AVs from the operative usage in our daily life routines. Once manually controlled vehicles are linked to the Internet, so-called the Internet of Vehicles (IoVs), they would be misused by cyberattacks. In this paper, we present a multi-stage intrusion detection framework to identify intrusions from ITSs and produce low rate of false alarms. The proposed framework can automatically distinguish intrusions in real-time. The proposed framework is based on normal state-based and a deep learning-centered bidirectional Long Short Term Memory (LSTM) architecture to efficiently discover intrusions from the fundamental network gateways and communication networks of AVs. The designed framework is evaluated through two benchmark datasources, that is, the UNSWNB-15 datasource for exterior network communications and the car hacking datasource for in-vehicle communications. The outcomes indicated that the proposed framework achieves high performance that outperforms various current state-of-the-art systems with an accuracy rate of 98.88% for the UNSWNB-15 dataset and 99.11% for the car hacking dataset. Besides, the proposed framework is furthermore capable to detect zero-day (concealed) outbreaks from IoVs networks.	https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9519840	0
Aerial-Terrestrial Network NOMA for Cellular-Connected UAVs	Efficient connectivity in cellular-connected unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV)s is limited by scarcity of the radio spectrum and strong inter-cell interference (ICI). To address these issues, we propose an aerial-terrestrial network non-orthogonal multiple access (ATN-NOMA) scheme. In this proposed scheme, we pair the aerial user (AU) and terrestrial user (TU) in a NOMA setting to leverage their asymmetric channel gains and rate demands in downlink communications. In ATN-NOMA, the strong ICI issue at the AU receiver is further managed by an elevation-angle based user association, equipping the AU with an adjustable beamwidth directional antenna, and forming a beamforming among the coordinated terrestrial base stations (BS)s. We then obtain the optimal beamwidth and suboptimal power allocation so that the TUs’ sum-rate is maximized subject to the AU’s Quality-of-Service (QoS) requirement. The corresponding optimization problem is non-convex in which we exploit the structure of the problem and apply successive convex approximation (SCA) to obtain a suboptimal solution. We then derive the statistical properties, which consequently enable us to estimate the aggregated ICI. In cases where no interfering BSs have the same elevation angle as the coordinated BSs, we further approximate the AU’s outage probability. We then compare the TUs’ sum-rate and the outage probability of the ATN-NOMA with multiple existing schemes. Extensive simulation results show that our proposed ATN-NOMA scheme outperforms existing schemes by 52-91% in terms of the sum-rate, and its analytical outage probability can be as low as the order of $10^{-17}$. Furthermore, we show that the pairing of AU and TU in multi-cell networks remains beneficial, subject to effective mitigation of ICI.	https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9750898	0
Daedalus: Breaking Nonmaximum Suppression in Object Detection via Adversarial Examples	This article demonstrates that nonmaximum suppression (NMS), which is commonly used in object detection (OD) tasks to filter redundant detection results, is no longer secure. Considering that NMS has been an integral part of OD systems, thwarting the functionality of NMS can result in unexpected or even lethal consequences for such systems. In this article, an adversarial example attack that triggers malfunctioning of NMS in OD models is proposed. The attack, namely, Daedalus, compresses the dimensions of detection boxes to evade NMS. As a result, the final detection output contains extremely dense false positives. This can be fatal for many OD applications, such as autonomous vehicles and surveillance systems. The attack can be generalized to different OD models, such that the attack cripples various OD applications. Furthermore, a way of crafting robust adversarial examples is developed by using an ensemble of popular detection models as the substitutes. Considering the pervasive nature of model reuse in real-world OD scenarios, Daedalus examples crafted based on an ensemble of substitutes can launch attacks without knowing the parameters of the victim models. The experimental results demonstrate that the attack effectively stops NMS from filtering redundant bounding boxes. As the evaluation results suggest, Daedalus increases the false positive rate in detection results to 99.9% and reduces the mean average precision scores to 0, while maintaining a low cost of distortion on the original inputs. It also demonstrates that the attack can be practically launched against real-world OD systems via printed posters.	https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9313033	0
Train in Dense and Test in Sparse: A Method for Sparse Object Detection in Aerial Images	Applications of aerial imaging, especially based on unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) platform, rapidly explode in recent years. Meanwhile, vision-based sensing, e.g., detection and recognition, for UAVs becomes increasingly important. Objects in aerial images are usually of tiny size, hence occupying a limited area. Terminology speaking, the images are very sparse in spatial. However, existing work in aerial object detection commonly ignores this point. Conversely, we explore the availability of such a property in improving the detection performance of aerial images. Specifically, we propose a general method, train in dense and test in sparse (TDTS), to exploit sparsity in aerial object detection: 1) in the training stage, the possible positions of object are learned by training a fully convolutional network (called prophet head) and 2) in the testing stage, prophet head identifies the possible object locations to reduce redundant computation in classification and box prediction head by sparse convolution. By extensive experiments on the VisDrone2019-Det data set, we find that the sparsity can not only help to speed up inference but also to improve accuracy. Thus, we argue that the sparsity deserves more attention.	https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9257003	0
On the Performance of UAV Relaying With Reconfigurable Antenna and Media Based Modulation in the Presence of Shadowed Fading	Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) have attracted significant interest from the academia and industry most recently. Motivated by the wide usage of UAVs, this letter considers UAV communication with reconfigurable antenna (RA) in the presence of fading and shadowing effects, which occur due to tall buildings and skyscrapers in urban areas. More precisely, RA offers to receive information through mirror activation patterns (MAPs) so that it can achieve a receive diversity with decreased error probability by using only one radio frequency chain. Also, media-based modulation (MBM) technique with MAPs can be exploited by using RAs with reduced cost. To quantify the performance of the proposed UAV system, we derive a tight upper bound for the overall error probability by considering approximated channel model based on the standardization studies. The results have shown that RAs can make the overall system more resilient to shadowing and fading effects in terms of error performance, and they are energy efficient.	https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9796150	0
Stereo Orientation Prior for UAV Robust and Accurate Visual Odometry	This article presents a novel outlier rejection approach for feature-based visual odometry. The proposed approach is based on an empirical observation that shows that some 2D–3D correspondences with very low reprojection error can cause a high error in pose estimation. This work exploits such observations for odometry when a stereo camera is available. We argue that an explicit pose error measure is desired over that of implicit reprojection – whenever the former is possible – to classify correspondences into inliers versus outliers for the robust long-term odometry. To explicitly measure the plausible pose error, we derive bounds on the individual pose parameters with the help of the known orientation of stereo cameras. In this process, we formulate our bounds using the sum-of-square polynomials, which allow us to test whether a given correspondence satisfies any solution within the expected bounds. If the correspondence does not satisfy bounds for any parameter, it is considered to be an outlier. We implemented and tested the proposed method for the unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) indoor navigation. The experiments from both benchmark evaluations (EuRoC and KITTI) and UAV onboard tests indicate that the inlier group refined by the proposed method significantly improves odometry estimation compared to the traditional outlier rejection methods. In fact, the proposed method performs as accurately as inertial measurement unit (IMU) aided methods in the state of the art.

Renewable Energy Re-Distribution via Multiscale IoT for 6G-Oriented Green Highway Management	While recent works on investigating renewable energy sources for powering the highway offer promising solutions for sustainable environments, they are often impeded by unequal distribution of sources across the region due to variations in solar exposure and road intensity that electromagnetically and mechanically generate the energy. By exploiting viable gathering of massive renewable energy data using the Internet of Things (IoT), this paper proposes a framework for improved highway-energy management based on the unmanned aerial vehicle-assisted wireless energy re-distribution of the harvested renewable energy. Combining both massive low-rate sensing with high-speed 6G-envisioned transmission for data aggregation, the IoT architecture is of multi-scale, consisting of: i) global data exchange and analytics for energy mapping, re-distribution planning and forecasting, and ii) local data sensing and processing at individual highway lampposts for micro-energy management. The feasibility of the networked energy system is analyzed via analytical cost-reliability analyses. The cost analysis demonstrates the cost-effectiveness through the lowest Requirement of Energy and Cost of Energy for the setup and maintenance. The reliability analysis reveals the energy plus (E+) feature of the system in certain conditions with enhanced reliability in adverse weathers that impact energy generation. With multi-scale data connectivity to intelligently manage standalone renewable energy, this work puts forward a viable idea of 6G use cases with massively networked energy sensors with a vision of achieving super-connected and intelligence-equipped highways.	https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9894364	0
Covert Communication With Energy Replenishment Constraints in UAV Networks	In this paper, we investigate the possibility and condition of exploiting wireless-powered signals as a cover for conducting covert communications in unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) networks. Specifically, we aim to design the hovering altitude of a UAV and its prior transmission probability to strike a balance between energy replenishment and covert communications. We derive the necessary condition for guaranteeing communication covertness subject to an energy replenishment constraint, under which the UAV’s optimal hovering and the prior transmission probability are determined. Our simulation shows that varying the prior transmission probability can significantly improve the achievable communication covertness under the energy replenishment constraint, relative to a baseline scheme with a fixed prior transmission probability.	https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9783114	0
Kinematic Orienteering Problem With Time-Optimal Trajectories for Multirotor UAVs	In many unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) applications for surveillance and data collection, it is not possible to reach all requested locations due to the given maximum flight time. Hence, the requested locations must be prioritized and the problem of selecting the most important locations is modeled as an Orienteering Problem (OP). To fully exploit the kinematic properties of the UAV in such scenarios, we combine the OP with the generation of time-optimal trajectories with bounds on velocity and acceleration. We define the resulting problem as the Kinematic Orienteering Problem (KOP) and propose an exact mixed-integer formulation together with a Large Neighborhood Search (LNS) as a heuristic solution method. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach based on orienteering instances from the literature and benchmark against optimal solutions of the Dubins Orienteering Problem (DOP) as the state-of-the-art. Additionally, we show by simulation that the resulting solutions can be tracked precisely by a modern MPC-based flight controller. Since we demonstrate that the state-of-the-art in generating time-optimal trajectories in multiple dimensions is not generally correct, we further present an improved analytical method for time-optimal trajectory generation.	https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9844257	0
Multispectral Semantic Land Cover Segmentation From Aerial Imagery With Deep Encoder–Decoder Network	Developing accurate algorithms for agricultural pattern recognition from aerial imagery has become increasingly important due to the prevalence of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs). This letter introduces a deep encoder–decoder network for semantic land cover segmentation, where the goal is to classify six anomaly categories from multispectral aerial imagery. Since aerial imagery exhibits specific characteristics and visual challenges in this imaging domain, existing semantic segmentation models are not plug-and-play. Starting from a state-of-the-art segmentation model, we present a step-by-step analysis of key challenges and also reveal our observations in addressing these challenges. In particular, we investigate on how to exploit data prior knowledge, how to deal with sample imbalance, and how to encode global semantic and contextual information to improve segmentation. Experiments on a recent large-scale aerial land cover data set demonstrate that our method achieves compelling performance against other state-of-the-art approaches. Our results and insights can provide references for practitioners working in this field when dealing with similar segmentation problems.	https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9269368	0
Prioritized Delay Optimization for NOMA-Based Multi-UAV Emergency Networks	In emergency networks, it is significant to jointly consider users’ priorities and communication delays for post-disaster users. To this end, we propose an essential metric by integrating these two factors, namely prioritized delay. Moreover, we formulate a min-max prioritized delay problem for non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA)-based multi-unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) emergency networks, where the powers of all users are concurrently optimized to balance prioritized delay among users while suppressing multi-user interference introduced by NOMA and multiple UAVs. The problem is found to be non-convex, and we propose the substitution-decomposition-scaling-block successive upper bound minimization (SDS-BSUM) algorithm to address this issue. Specifically, the originally-formulated problem is first transformed into a standard form through variable substitution, followed by problem decomposition into single-UAV subproblems through exploiting its separable structure, and the scaling of non-convex constraints into tight convex ones. Finally, the converted problem is fitted into BSUM for solving. Simulation results reveal that compared with the existing schemes, the proposed SDS-BSUM not only reduces the prioritized delay by up to 70$\%$, but also achieves an excellent delay fairness commensurate with users’ priorities.	https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9802742	0
Cluster-Based Characterization and Modeling for UAV Air-to-Ground Time-Varying Channels	With the deep integration between the unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) and wireless communication, UAV-based air-to-ground (AG) propagation channels need more detailed descriptions and accurate models. In this paper, we aim to conduct cluster-based characterization and modeling for AG channels. To our best knowledge, this is the first study that concentrates on the clustering and tracking of multipath components (MPCs) for time-varying AG channels. Based on measurement data at 6.5 GHz with a bandwidth of 500 MHz, we first estimate potential MPCs utilizing the space-alternating generalized expectation-maximization (SAGE) algorithm. Then, we cluster the extracted MPCs by employing K-Power-Means (KPM) algorithm under multipath component distance (MCD) measure. For characterizing time-variant clusters, we exploit a clustering-based tracking (CBT) method, which efficiently quantifies the survival lengths of clusters. Ultimately, we establish a cluster-based channel model, and validations illustrate the accuracy of the proposed model. This work not only promotes a better understanding of AG propagation channels but also provides a general cluster-based AG channel model with certain extensibility.	https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9760200	0
Safety Flight Control for a Quadrotor UAV Using Differential Flatness and Dual-Loop Observers	Focusing on a quadrotor unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV), the presence of unintended actuator faults and external disturbances increases the risk of a crash. Although plenty of efforts have been devoted, how to integrate capability analysis into safety control design is still an open issue. This article presents the design of a safety control system for quadrotor UAVs. Firstly, a system capability analysis method based on a differential flatness algorithm is developed, so that the derivatives (i.e., velocity, jerk, and snap) of flight trajectory can be formulated as flat variables. A tradeoff between system capability and permissible flight maneuverability is made to avoid actuator saturation. Secondly, dual-loop nonlinear disturbance observers are exploited to identify the actuator faults and disturbances, which can thereby be handled by a cascade control scheme. Moreover, the trajectory is regenerated online at the expense of degraded flight maneuverability or even emergency landing, in view of the remaining actuator control authority. When comparing to the existing methods, the gap among safety control, trajectory generation, and system capability analysis is bridged to ameliorate practical flight safety. Finally, flight tests are carried out to demonstrate the unique merits of the proposed system.	https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9658283	0
On Detecting Drunk Drivers in Mixed Autonomous Platoons Using Vehicles Velocity Measurements	Drunk drivers, who critically and continuously threaten road safety, are usually detected using biological sensors within the same vehicle or after drunk driving behavior is observed by police patrols. Observing an obvious drunk driving behavior indicates a relatively high blood alcohol concentration, and thus, detecting drunk drivers with a relatively low blood alcohol concentration is difficult. This study uses output-only measurements available from motion sensors in the longitudinal drive of mixed autonomous and human-driven platoons to detect drunk drivers’ behavior in human-driven vehicles within the same platoon. The human-driven vehicle is assumed to be between two autonomous vehicles that are able to share information with each other. The proposed approach relates a set of motion sensor measurements with another within the platoon and does not require the knowledge of the excitation signal or the dynamics of the platoon. Numerical simulations are first implemented to test the proposed approach, and then, VISSIM software is implemented to simulate realistic road topography. Further validations on laboratory mobile robots are presented in this article, where a class of abnormal driving conditions that includes human-driven vehicles is simulated. Experiments are carried out by measuring abnormal human-driven vehicles within connected autonomous robots. This method is shown to deal with various system uncertainties, and the approach can deal with the drunk driver case. The drunken driving conditions are modeled mathematically with different blood alcohol concentration levels, which correspond to different effects and different drunk driving behaviors. The proposed transmissibility-based drunk driver detection algorithm is shown to detect drivers with risky relatively low alcohol concentrations.	https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9850392	0
Intelligent Event-Based Fuzzy Dynamic Positioning Control of Nonlinear Unmanned Marine Vehicles Under DoS Attack	This article addresses the dynamic positioning control problem of a nonlinear unmanned marine vehicle (UMV) system subject to network communication constraints and deny-of-service (DoS) attack, where the dynamics of UMV are described by a Takagi–Sugeno (T-S) fuzzy system (TSFS). In order to save limited communication resource, a new intelligent event-triggering mechanism is proposed, in which the event triggering threshold is optimized by a  $Q$ -learning algorithm. Then, a switched system approach is proposed to deal with the aperiodic DoS attack occurring in the communication channels. With a proper piecewise Lyapunov function, some sufficient conditions for global exponential stability (GES) of the closed-loop nonlinear UMV system are derived, and the corresponding observer and controller gains are designed via solving a set of matrix inequalities. A benchmark nonlinear UMV system is adopted as an example in simulation, and the simulation results validate the effectiveness of the proposed control method.	https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9635711	0
Unmanned Ground Vehicle Platooning Under Cyber Attacks: A Human-Robot Interaction Framework	In this paper, we propose a human-robot interaction (HRI) framework to reduce the vulnerability of an unmanned ground vehicle (UGV) platoon under cyber attacks. An observer-based autonomous resilient control strategy is first designed to mitigate the effects of vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) cyber attacks. Rigorous proof of the safety conditions of the platoon under V2V cyber attacks is derived. Next, to facilitate human supervision in emergencies and uncertainties, a decision-making aid system is developed, which consists of an anomaly reporting system (ARS), a trust-based information management system (TIMS), and a graphical user interface (GUI). ARS is designed to detect the abnormality of the neighbor UGVs based on the model-based residual generation and analysis. TIMS is developed to rule out information with low trustworthiness, which is fulfilled by a Bayesian-based information pre-processor followed by an enhanced median filter with trustworthiness regulation. It is rigorously proved that TIMS can recover the tempered information under the mild cyber attack scenario autonomously. To deal with unexpected severe vehicle-to-cloud (V2C) cyber attacks, human observations can also be leveraged to bolster the resilience of the TIMS. Representative simulation and humans-in-the-loop experiment (fulfilled by the designed GUI) demonstrate that the proposed framework can effectively guide human operators when working with UGV platoons under cyber attacks. On average, compared to a multi-screen surveillance benchmark approach, the proposed framework can achieve 78.4% decrements of platoon vulnerability and 39.0% decrements in human workload.	https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9716850	0
FSNet: A Failure Detection Framework for Semantic Segmentation	Semantic segmentation is an important task that helps autonomous vehicles understand their surroundings and navigate safely. However, during deployment, even the most mature segmentation models are vulnerable to various external factors that can degrade the segmentation performance with potentially catastrophic consequences for the vehicle and its surroundings. To address this issue, we propose a failure detection framework to identify pixel-level misclassification. We do so by exploiting internal features of the segmentation model and training it simultaneously with a failure detection network. During deployment, the failure detector flags areas in the image where the segmentation model has failed to segment correctly. We evaluate the proposed approach against state-of-the-art methods and achieve 12.30%, 9.46%, and 9.65% performance improvement in the AUPR-Error metric for Cityscapes, BDD100k, and Mapillary semantic segmentation datasets.	https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9682519	0
Event-Based Fault Detection for Unmanned Surface Vehicles Subject to Denial-of-Service Attacks	In this work, the problem of event-based fault detection is addressed for unmanned surface vehicles (USVs) under denial-of-service (DoS) jamming attacks. A fault detection filter (FDF) is deployed to generate residual for USV systems with external disturbance and system faults. A resilient event-triggered mechanism is implemented to reduce the bandwidth occupation of communication network and energy consumption of USV system as well as mitigating the influence of DoS attacks. Based on the established framework, a switched residual system is constructed and a criterion is deduced to ensure the exponential stability and weighted  $H_{\infty }$  performance of residual system via piecewise Lyapunov functional approach. The FDF and resilient event-triggered mechanism are co-designed. Simulation results are provided to testify the efficient performance of the devised resilient event-triggered fault detection method.	https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9386148	0
Saliency Heat-Map as Visual Attention for Autonomous Driving Using Generative Adversarial Network (GAN)	The ability to sense and understanding the driving environment is a key technology for ADAS and autonomous driving. Human drivers have to pay more visual attention to important or target elements and ignore unnecessary ones present in their field of sight. A model that computes this visual attention of targets in a specific driving environment is essential and useful in supporting autonomous driving, object-specific tracking & detection, driving training, car collision warning, traffic sign detection, etc. In this paper, we propose a new framework of visual attention that can predict important objects in the driving scene using a conditional generative adversarial network. A large scale Visual Attention Driving Database (VADD) of saliency heat-maps is built from existing driving datasets using a saliency mechanism. The proposed framework model takes its strength from these saliency heat-maps as conditioning label variables. The results show that the proposed approach makes us able to predict heat-maps of most important objects in a driving environment.	https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9349146	0
Event-Triggering and Quantized Sliding Mode Control of UMV Systems Under DoS Attack	This paper is concerned with security control of nonlinear unmanned marine vehicle (UMV) systems under a networked environment. The UMV system and land-based control station are connected by a communication network. Considering the limited communication resource in the marine environment, the dynamic event-triggering mechanisms are proposed in the sensor to controller and controller to actuator sides simultaneously. Meanwhile, the triggered output data is then quantized by a logarithmic quantizer before being sent to the remote control station. First, based on the Takagi-Sugeno (T-S) fuzzy theory, the nonlinear UMV system is molded as a T-S fuzzy model. Then a hybrid switched fuzzy system is established by taking the DoS attack and quantization effect into account. An observer-based sliding mode control (SMC) scheme is proposed to stabilize the system under DoS attack, and the observer gains and controller gains can be obtained by solving a set of matrix inequalities. Finally, a benchmark UMV system is used to show the effectiveness of control scheme.	https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9779098	0
Location-Based Schemes for Mitigating Cyber Threats on Connected and Automated Vehicles: A Survey and Design Framework	The increased automation and connectivity of vehicles and road infrastructure can make future transportation systems more efficient and smarter and enable new transportation business models. Connected and automated vehicles (CAVs) may form a group of autonomous fleets to transform today’s shared mobility services and also play the role of mobile sensors, which share real-time traffic and road information for transportation management. However, these technological advancements also lead to new cyber and physical threats that cause safety hazards or other undesired consequences. Although there have been a large number of papers about identifying and mitigating each type of threat, the lack of design support still challenges security engineering for developing CAVs. This limits the engineering capabilities of original equipment manufacturers to prioritize among multiple system properties, including safety, security, and privacy, and dealing with ever-changing attack surfaces and the power of attackers. This paper surveys security vulnerabilities and defense mechanisms for CAVs from an engineering design perspective. We illustrate how to identify and mitigate physical threats that compromise the safety of individual vehicles and cyber threats that disrupt newly CAV-enabled transportation services in a systematic way. An integrated security engineering process and a multi-layer design framework are presented for providing traceability and guidance in threat identification and mitigation.	https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9284448	0
Autonomous Single-Image Drone Exploration With Deep Reinforcement Learning and Mixed Reality	Autonomous exploration is a longstanding goal of the robotics community. Aerial drone navigation has proven to be especially challenging. The stringent requirements on cost, weight, maneuverability, and power consumption do not allow exploration approaches to easily be employed or adapted to different types of environments. End-to-End Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) techniques based on Convolutional Networks approximators, which grant constant-time computation, predefined memory usage, and deliver high visual perception capabilities, represent a very promising alternative to current state of the art solutions relying on metric environment reconstruction. In this work, we address the autonomous exploration problem with aerial robots with a monocular camera based on DRL. Specifically, we propose a novel asymmetric actor-critic model for drone exploration that efficiently leverages ground truth information provided by the simulator environment to speed up learning and enhance final exploration performances. Furthermore, in order to reduce the sim-to-real gap for exploration, we present a novel mixed reality framework that allows an easier, smoother, and safer simulation to real-world transition. Both aspects allow to further exploit the great potential of simulation engines and contribute to reducing the risk associated with directly deploying algorithms on a physical platform with no intermediate step between the simulation and the real world. This is well-known to create several safety concerns and be dangerous when deploying aerial vehicles. Experimental results with a drone exploring multiple environments show the effectiveness of the proposed approach.	https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9721080	0
Adversarial Evaluation of Autonomous Vehicles in Lane-Change Scenarios	Autonomous vehicles must be comprehensively evaluated before deployed in cities and highways. However, most existing evaluation approaches for autonomous vehicles are static and lack adaptability, so they are usually inefficient in generating challenging scenarios for tested vehicles. In this paper, we propose an adaptive evaluation framework to efficiently evaluate autonomous vehicles in adversarial environments generated by deep reinforcement learning. Considering the multimodal nature of dangerous scenarios, we use ensemble models to represent different local optimums for diversity. We then utilize a nonparametric Bayesian method to cluster the adversarial policies. The proposed method is validated in a typical lane-change scenario that involves frequent interactions between the ego vehicle and the surrounding vehicles. Results show that the adversarial scenarios generated by our method significantly degrade the performance of the tested vehicles. We also illustrate different patterns of generated adversarial environments, which can be used to infer the weaknesses of the tested vehicles.	https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9468363	0
How to Protect Key Drones in Unmanned Aerial Vehicle Networks? An SDN-Based Topology Deception Scheme	Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) networks, consisting of flexible, low-cost as well as easily deployable UAVs, have attracted intensive research interest recently. Due to different roles of drones in a network, some drones can be recognized as more important than others. For example, in UAV-assisted wireless sensor networks, drones can be used as store-carry and forward nodes to collect data from sensors and aid communications among them. If UAVs that act as the bridge of a large number of sensors are attacked, the production efficiency will be seriously affected. However, existing work concerning about UAV network security seldom noticed the differences among drones, let alone implementing special measures for protecting key drones. Motivated by this, we focus on the security issue of UAV networks from the perspective of key drones' protection. We first analyze the distinctions of attack impacts when adopting different target selection strategies, revealing that key drones exist and it is significantly important to protect them. Then, a topology deception scheme based on software-defined networking is proposed, which can mitigate the attack impact by tempting attackers through our well-designed virtual topologies, leading to their misjudgments on the key drones. Extensive experimental results illustrate that our scheme can effectively deceive attackers and significantly mitigate the impact of targeted attacks.	https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9864075	0
A multiple heterogeneous UAVs reconnaissance mission planning and re-planning algorithm	Reconnaissance mission planning of multiple unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) under an adversarial environment is a discrete combinatorial optimization problem which is proved to be a non-deterministic polynomial (NP)-complete problem. The purpose of this study is to research intelligent multi-UAVs reconnaissance mission planning and online re-planning algorithm under various constraints in mission areas. For numerous targets scattered in the wide area, a reconnaissance mission planning and re-planning system is established, which includes five modules, including intelligence analysis, sub-mission area division, mission sequence planning, path smoothing, and online re-planning. The intelligence analysis module depicts the attribute of targets and the heterogeneous characteristic of UAVs and computes the number of sub-mission areas on consideration of voyage distance constraints. In the sub-mission area division module, an improved $K$-means clustering algorithm is designed to divide the reconnaissance mission area into several sub-mission areas, and each sub-mission is detected by the UAV loaded with various detective sensors. To control reconnaissance cost, the sampling and iteration algorithms are proposed in the mission sequence planning module, which are utilized to solve the optimal or approximately optimal reconnaissance sequence. In the path smoothing module, the Dubins curve is applied to smooth the flight path, which assure the availability of the planned path. Furthermore, an online re-planning algorithm is designed for the uncertain factor that the UAV is damaged. Finally, reconnaissance planning and re-planning experiment results show that the algorithm proposed in this paper are effective and the algorithms designed for sequence planning have a great advantage in solving efficiency and optimality	https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=10009007	0
Passive UAV Tracking in Wireless Networks	Techniques for high accuracy tracking of the 3-D velocity, position, and cellular carrier frequency bias of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) that communicate using a cellular network are presented. The tracking algorithm does only rely on asynchronous measurements of Doppler shift in a minimum of four base station sites. This number can be reduced to three, by combination with a round-trip time measurement from one site. The tracking is therefore independent of any capability of the UAV transceiver, like the global positioning system that may be disabled in the UAV by the pilot. Another significant advantage is that high precision time synchronization between base stations is not needed. The algorithm exploits interacting multiple model filtering, with the nonlinear measurement equations handled by extended Kalman filters. The low computational complexity, low sampling rate, and the uplink Doppler shift measurement resources enable joint tracking of several UAVs per cell. This makes the tracking technique relevant for supervision of UAV traffic using cellular connectivity, for example for border surveillance and surveillance of sensitive areas like airports where illegal flying may be extremely dangerous and costly. Theoretically, an observability analysis treats measurement configurations based on different combinations of Doppler shift and round-trip time. Simulations are used to illustrate the performance and to assess the initialization properties.	https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9733239	0

BR-GAN: A Pedestrian Trajectory Prediction Model Combined With Behavior Recognition	Pedestrian trajectory prediction is a crucial task for many domains, such as self-driving, navigation robots and video surveillance. The performance of trajectory prediction can be improved in various patterns, including using a more effective network, considering more complicated social interactions, and utilizing sufficient information. On the one hand, the change of subsequent trajectory depends on the geographical scene and the social interaction with other pedestrians in the same scene. On the other hand, the subsequent trajectory also makes some real-time adjustments according to the judgment of pedestrian behavior. Therefore, we propose a novel behavior recognition module to obtain extra pedestrian behavior information. To guarantee the precision and diversity of prediction, this paper builds the Geographical, the Social and the Behavior feature modules based on the GAN framework to process information. As a result, we present a trajectory prediction approach, referred to as the BR-GAN, which exploits geographical, social and behavior context-aware. The BR-GAN achieves greater accuracy in parts of the ETH/UCY datasets compared with some baselines. We will republic all of them on https://github.com/HITjian/Pedestrian-trajectoty-prediction-based-on-behavior-recognition.	https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9851641	0
Byzantine-Resilient Distributed Hypothesis Testing With Time-Varying Network Topology	In this article, we study the problem of distributed hypothesis testing over a network of mobile agents with limited communication and sensing ranges to infer the true hypothesis collaboratively. In particular, we consider a scenario where there is an unknown subset of compromised agents that may deliberately share altered information to undermine the team objective. We propose two distributed algorithms where each agent maintains and updates two sets of beliefs (i.e., probability distributions over the hypotheses), namely local and actual beliefs (LB and AB, respectively, for brevity). In both algorithms, at every time step, each agent shares its AB with other agents within its communication range and makes a local observation to update its LB. Then, both algorithms can use the shared information to update ABs under certain conditions. One requires receiving a certain number of shared ABs at each time instant; the other accumulates shared ABs over time and updates after the number of shared ABs exceeds a prescribed threshold. Otherwise, both algorithms rely on the agent’s current LB and AB to update the new AB. We prove under mild assumptions that the AB for every noncompromised agent converges almost surely to the true hypothesis, without requiring connectivity in the underlying time-varying network topology. Using a simulation of a team of unmanned aerial vehicles aiming to classify adversarial agents among themselves, we illustrate and compare the proposed algorithms. Finally, we show experimentally that the second algorithm consistently outperforms the first algorithm in terms of the speed of convergence.	https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9508831	0
Joint Altitude and Hybrid Beamspace Precoding Optimization for UAV-Enabled Multiuser mmWave MIMO System	The combination of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) and millimeter wave (mmWave) multiple-input multiple-out (MIMO) system is regarded as a key enabling technology for beyond 5G networks, as it provides high data rate aerial links. However, establishing UAV-enabled mmWave MIMO communication is quite challenging due to the high hardware cost in terms of radio frequency (RF) chains. As a cost-effective alternative, a beamspace precoding with discrete lens arrays (DLA) architecture has received considerable attention. However, the underlying optimal design in beamspace precoding has not been fully exploited in UAV-enabled communication scenario. In this paper, the joint design of the UAV’s altitude and hybrid beamspace precoding is proposed for the UAV-enabled multiuser MIMO system, in which the DLA is exploited to reduce the number of the RF chain. In the proposed scheme, the optimization problem is formulated as a minimum weighted mean squared error (MWMSE) method. Then an efficient algorithm with the penalty dual decomposition (PDD) is proposed that aims to jointly optimize the altitude of UAV, beam selection and digital precoding matrices. Simulation results confirm the comparable performance of the proposed scheme and perform close to full-digital beamforming in terms of achievable spectral efficiency.	https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9648018	0
Pre-Predictive Congestion-Based Data Allocation for Sixth Generation Cooperative Intelligent Transportation Systems	Cooperative intelligent and autonomous transportation systems rely on intelligent sensing, computing, and actuating technologies for unmanned freight and public movements. The information gained from neighbors and communication infrastructures provides efficient actuation for safe and sustained transportation. This article resolves traffic data management congestion using sixth-generation (6G) communication and computing techniques. Terahertz and machine-type communications are exploited for swift information exchange, bypassing the congestion effects. Congestion occurs when demand for road space exceeds supply. This proposal incorporates prediction-based learning to compute the feasibility of handling traffic information and cooperative intelligent transportation. This model is named Congestion-aware Pre-predictive Data Allocation (CPPDA). The traffic flows causing congestion in the data exchange process are predicted for re-allocation and independent channel utilization. In this learning, the pre-predicted instances are updated with the actual identified utilization-to-congestion rate. Therefore, the congestion-causing channels for sensing are identified with ease, reducing the outage. The outage is examined for a basic inter-vehicle data link. Through the optimal allocation of channels for actuation, cloud-aided resources are utilized to a maximum level, leveraging infrastructure support. In addition to an outage of 10.83%, the response time of 14.75%, congestion factor of 8.2%, computational overhead of 6.4%, and information gain factors of 6.86% are analyzed through a comparative study.	https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9899366	0
Overriding Autonomous Driving Systems Using Adaptive Adversarial Billboards	The success of deep neural networks (DNNs) has led to its increased deployment in various real-world applications, which provides strong incentives for motivated adversaries to manipulate the results and models generated by these algorithms. We present an automated, physically-realizable, dynamic adversarial attack to compromise an end-to-end trained DNN controlled autonomous vehicle. The attack is initiated by installing a billboard displaying videos on the roadside to incoming DNN controlled vehicles so that the vehicle tracks an adversary customized trajectory. The billboard contains an integrated camera to enable estimation of the pose of the approaching vehicle. The dynamic billboard images (i.e., a video) continuously adapt to the vehicle’s relative pose with respect to the billboard while being robust to variations in lighting, view angle, and weather. The attack’s effectiveness is shown on a recently developed off-the-shelf high-fidelity simulator, CARLA, for autonomous vehicles. CARLA utilizes an end-to-end learning-based autonomous navigation system. The proposed approach is applicable to other end-to-end trained autonomous cyber-physical systems.	https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9514525	0
Multi-Helper NOMA for Cooperative Mobile Edge Computing	The next-generation wireless networks are expected to support a number of computation-intensive and delay-sensitive applications such as virtual reality (VR), autonomous driving, telesurgery and unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs). Since many devices are computation and power limited, mobile edge computing (MEC) has been deemed as a promising way to enhance computation service. In this paper, we propose a novel cooperative MEC that exploits the combination of non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) and multiple helpers. In the proposed system featuring a user, multiple helpers and a base station (BS), the user can simultaneously offload its computation-intensive tasks to the helpers using NOMA when there is no strong direct transmission link between the user and the BS. Then, the helpers can compute and offload these tasks through NOMA. Thus, in the proposed scheme, the computation and offloading modes at the helpers are determined with respect to the optimized task offloading decision factor. The simulation results show that the proposed NOMA-based cooperative MEC significantly increases the total offloading data under the latency constraints compared to the benchmark schemes featuring one helper with strong direct transmission link.	https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9566305	0
SSPNet: Scale Selection Pyramid Network for Tiny Person Detection From UAV Images	With the increasing demand for search and rescue, it is highly demanded to detect objects of interest in large-scale images captured by unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), which is quite challenging due to extremely small scales of objects. Most existing methods employed a feature pyramid network (FPN) to enrich shallow layers’ features by combining deep layers’ contextual features. However, under the limitation of the inconsistency in gradient computation across different layers, the shallow layers in FPN are not fully exploited to detect tiny objects. In this article, we propose a scale selection pyramid network (SSPNet) for tiny person detection, which consists of three components: context attention module (CAM), scale enhancement module (SEM), and scale selection module (SSM). CAM takes account of context information to produce hierarchical attention heatmaps. SEM highlights features of specific scales at different layers, leading the detector to focus on objects of specific scales instead of vast backgrounds. SSM exploits adjacent layers’ relationships to fulfill suitable feature sharing between deep layers and shallow layers, thereby avoiding the inconsistency in gradient computation across different layers. Besides, we propose a weighted negative sampling (WNS) strategy to guide the detector to select more representative samples. Experiments on the TinyPerson benchmark show that our method outperforms other state-of-the-art (SOTA) detectors.	https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9515145	0
Second-Order-Optimal Filter on Lie Groups for Planar Rigid Bodies	Attitude estimation is a core problem in many mobile robotic systems, such as unmanned aerial and ground vehicles. The configuration space of these systems is properly modeled by exploiting the theory of Lie groups. In this article, we propose a second-order-optimal minimum-energy filter on the matrix Lie group TSE(2), the tangent bundle of the special Euclidean group SE(2), where the optimality is with respect to a cost function in the unknown input and output error measurements. In this article, the measurement equation consists of a global positioning system-like device with two antennas attached to the planar rigid body and an inertial measurement unit-like device. Even though the mathematics is quite complicated, the accuracy of the filter justifies this approach. Simulations show the effectiveness of the proposed filter.	https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9788016	0
Survey on Cooperative Perception in an Automotive Context	The idea of cooperation has been introduced to self-driving cars about a decade ago with the aim to reduce the occlusion caused by other users or the scene. More recently, the research efforts turned toward cooperative infrastructure bringing a new kind of the point of view as well as more processing power. This paper lies in this new field providing a survey that addresses the cooperative environment. We provide an overview of the architectures available to create such a system as well as the challenges introduced by the cooperation. Later, we review the main blocks involved in the perception: localization, object detection & tracking, map generation. Each block is reviewed under the prism of cooperation. We also provide a Strengths, Weaknesses, Opportunities, and Threats (SWOT) analysis of the cooperative perception as well as a list of related scenarios alongside experimentations. Finally, we list some related datasets before concluding our paper, underlining the perspectives for further works.	https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9732063	0
Machine Learning-Empowered Beam Management for mmWave-NOMA in Multi-UAVs Networks	We consider a mission-driven multiple unmanned aerial vehicles (multi-UAVs) network with millimeter-wave (mmWave) transmissions, where a leader UAV (LUAV) communicates with a large number of follower UAVs (FUAVs) simultaneously via a uniform planar array with only a limited number of radio frequency chains. Since only a few orthogonal beams are available and mission-driven UAV networks are autonomous and delay-sensitive, non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) over these beams is considered for agility and efficiency. In particular, aiming to address these challenges of highly dynamic mobility, we propose a machine learning framework to enable agile analog beam management for mmWave-NOMA transmissions. The proposed beam management aims to achieve efficient beam tracking and NOMA-grouping-aware analog beamforming optimization to facilitate mmWave-NOMA transmissions by judiciously utilizing angular domain information (ADI). More specifically, a Gaussian process machine learning-based ADI prediction scheme is proposed to track the angular dynamics of FUAVs, which facilitates fast beam-tracking for mmWave-NOMA transmissions. Moreover, by exploiting the predicted ADI, an unsupervised-learning-based FUAV grouping scheme is proposed to facilitate mmWave-NOMA transmissions with high radio-frequency chain efficiency, while a deep learning-based NOMA-grouping-aware fast transmit beamforming optimization scheme is proposed to improve the coverage of mmWave-NOMA transmissions in highly dynamic multi-UAVs networks. Simulation results validate the performance advantages of our proposed beam management scheme against state-of-the-art schemes.	https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9773960	0
A Shared Representation for Photorealistic Driving Simulators	A powerful simulator highly decreases the need for real-world tests when training and evaluating autonomous vehicles. Data-driven simulators flourished with the recent advancement of conditional Generative Adversarial Networks (cGANs), providing high-fidelity images. The main challenge is synthesizing photorealistic images while following given constraints. In this work, we propose to improve the quality of generated images by rethinking the discriminator architecture. The focus is on the class of problems where images are generated given semantic inputs, such as scene segmentation maps or human body poses. We build on successful cGAN models to propose a new semantically-aware discriminator that better guides the generator. We aim to learn a shared latent representation that encodes enough information to jointly do semantic segmentation, content reconstruction, along with a coarse-to-fine grained adversarial reasoning. The achieved improvements are generic and simple enough to be applied to any architecture of conditional image synthesis. We demonstrate the strength of our method on the scene, building, and human synthesis tasks across three different datasets. The code is available https://github.com/vita-epfl/SemDisc.	https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9635715	0
Detection of Nonrandom Sign-Based Behavior for Resilient Coordination of Robotic Swarms	Cooperative multirobot systems coordinate their motion by exchanging information through consensus schemes to achieve a common goal. In the event of stealthy cyber attacks, compromised measurements and communication broadcasts can hijack a portion or the entire system toward undesired states. However, in order for these attacks to be effective, they have to exhibit nonrandom characteristics that contradict the expected multirobot system behavior. To deal with these hidden attacks, we propose a runtime monitoring framework that considers the signed residual, defined as the difference between the expected and the received information to identify and isolate unexpected nonrandom behavior within the multirobot system. Specifically, the technique that we propose—named Cumulative Sign detector—monitors and compares changes in signed values of residual with their expected occurrences to detect inconsistencies and trigger alarms when an attack is discovered. Our results are validated theoretically by providing detection bounds and are demonstrated with simulations and experiments on swarms of unmanned ground vehicles under different attacks in comparison with state-of-the-art residual-based detection schemes.	https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9686360	0
Federated Feature Selection for Cyber-Physical Systems of Systems	Autonomous vehicles (AVs) generate a massive amount of multi-modal data that once collected and processed through Machine Learning algorithms, enable AI-based services at the Edge. In fact, only a subset of the collected data present informative attributes to be exploited at the Edge. Therefore, extracting such a subset is of utmost importance to limit computation and communication workloads. Doing that in a distributed manner imposes the AVs to cooperate in finding an agreement on which attributes should be sent to the Edge. In this work, we address such a problem by proposing a federated feature selection (FFS) algorithm where the AVs collaborate to filter out, iteratively, the less relevant attributes in a distributed manner, without any exchange of raw data, thought two different components: a Mutual-Information-based feature selection algorithm run by the AVs and a novel aggregation function based on the Bayes theorem executed on the Edge. The FFS algorithm has been tested on two reference datasets: MAV with images and inertial measurements of a monitored vehicle, WESAD with a collection of samples from biophysical sensors to monitor a relative passenger. The numerical results show that the AVs converge to a minimum achievable subset of features with both the datasets, i.e., 24 out of 2166 (99%) in MAV and 4 out of 8 (50%) in WESAD, respectively, preserving the informative content of data.	https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9783110	0
Study of Multiple Target Defense Differential Games Using Receding Horizon-Based Switching Strategies	In this article, we study a variation of the active target-attacker-defender (ATAD) differential game involving multiple targets, an attacker, and a defender. Our model allows for 1) a capability of the defender to switch roles from rescuer (rendezvous with all the targets) to interceptor (intercepts the attacker) and vice versa and 2) the attacker to continuously pursue the closest target (which can change during the course of the game). We assume that the mode of the defender (rescue or interception) defines the mode of the game itself. Using the framework of Games of a Degree, we first analyze the game within each mode. More specifically, the objectives of the players are taken as a combination of weighted Euclidean distances and penalties on their control efforts. We model the interaction of the players within each mode as a linear quadratic differential game (LQDG) and obtain the open-loop Nash equilibrium strategies. We then use the receding horizon approach to enable switching between the modes to obtain switching strategies for the players. By partitioning the matrices associated with the Riccati differential equations we obtain geometric characterization of the trajectories of the players. Furthermore, under mild restrictions on the problem parameters and for a particular choice of the defender’s switching function we show that interception mode is invariant. We illustrate our results with numerical simulations. Experimental results involving multiple autonomous differential drive mobile robots are presented.	https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9524434	0
A Push-Based Probabilistic Method for Source Location Privacy Protection in Underwater Acoustic Sensor Networks	As the research topics in ocean emerge, underwater acoustic sensor networks (UASNs) have become ever more relevant. Consequently, challenges arise with the security and privacy of the UASNs. Compared to the active attacks, the characteristics of passive attacks are more difficult to discriminate. Thus, the focus of this study is on the passive attacks in UASNs, where a push-based probabilistic method for source location privacy protection (PP-SLPP) is proposed. The fake packet technology and the multipath technology are utilized in the PP-SLPP scheme to counter the passive attacks, so as to protect the source location privacy in UASNs. Moreover, the Ekman drift current model is employed to simulate the underwater environment. And the mean shift algorithm and the k-means algorithm are adopted in the dynamic layer and static layer of the Ekman drift current model, respectively, to increase the stability of the clusters. Finally, an autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV) swarm is implemented to collect data in clusters. Through the comparison with existing data collection schemes in UASNs, the simulation results have demonstrated that the PP-SLPP scheme can achieve a longer safety period, with a minor compromise of energy consumption and delay.	https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9446512	0
Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV)-Assisted Path Planning for Unmanned Ground Vehicles (UGVs) via Disciplined Convex-Concave Programming	Thelast decade has witnessed growing research interests in the path-planning problem for unmanned ground vehicles (UGVs) equipped with RGB-D cameras or LiDARs. However, apart from their extremely high cost, these sensors may be obscured by obstacles, which makes them impractical for many complex scenarios. Besides, most of the existing works for path planning have not considered energy efficiency for UGVs that are usually constrained by limited on-board batteries. Distinct from existing methods, this work presents a vision-based unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV)-assisted cooperative system for multiple UGVs. The proposed system harnesses the broad vision of UAV and operates in both general outdoor and global positioning system (GPS)-denied indoor environments. In sharp contrast to the conventional heuristic algorithms such as the rapidly exploring random tree (RRT) algorithm and the Dijkstra methods, the proposed energy-efficient path planning for UGVs is formulated as a non-convex optimization problem by considering the collision-aware obstacle-avoidance. More specifically, the proposed path-planning scheme contains two stages, namely the semantic segmentation that localizes UGVs and obstacles in the environment by exploiting the wide-angle camera mounted on the UAV, followed by the trajectory generation in which a disciplined convex and concave programming (DCCP) algorithm is devised for the non-convex energy-minimization problem. Extensive experiments validate the effectiveness of the UAV-UGV cooperative system and the proposed DCCP-based path-planning scheme.	https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9760118	0
OverlapTransformer: An Efficient and Yaw-Angle-Invariant Transformer Network for LiDAR-Based Place Recognition	Place recognition is an important capability for autonomously navigating vehicles operating in complex environments and under changing conditions. It is a key component for tasks such as loop closing in SLAM or global localization. In this letter, we address the problem of place recognition based on 3D LiDAR scans recorded by an autonomous vehicle. We propose a novel lightweight neural network exploiting the range image representation of LiDAR sensors to achieve fast execution with less than 2 ms per frame. We design a yaw-angle-invariant architecture exploiting a transformer network, which boosts the place recognition performance of our method. We evaluate our approach on the KITTI and Ford Campus datasets. The experimental results show that our method can effectively detect loop closures compared to the state-of-the-art methods and generalizes well across different environments. To evaluate long-term place recognition performance, we provide a novel dataset containing LiDAR sequences recorded by a mobile robot in repetitive places at different times.	https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9785497	0
Asymptotic Boundary Shrink Control With Multirobot Systems	Harmful marine spills, such as algae blooms and oil spills, damage ecosystems and threaten public health tremendously. Hence, an effective spill coverage and removal strategy will play a significant role in environmental protection. In recent years, low-cost water surface robots have emerged as a solution, with their efficacy verified at small scale. However, practical limitations, such as connectivity, scalability, and sensing and operation ranges significantly impair their large-scale use. To circumvent these limitations, we propose a novel asymptotic boundary shrink control strategy that enables collective coverage of a spill by autonomous robots featuring customized operation ranges. For each robot, a novel controller is implemented that relies only on local vision sensors with limited vision range. Moreover, the distributedness of this strategy allows any number of robots to be employed without inter-robot collisions. Finally, features of this approach including the convergence of robot motion during boundary shrink control, spill clearance rate, and the capability to work under limited ranges of vision and wireless connectivity are validated through extensive experiments with simulation.	https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9136732	0
RFAP: A Revocable Fine-Grained Access Control Mechanism for Autonomous Vehicle Platoon	Autonomous Vehicle Platoon (AVP) is conceived as a promising solution to enhance the traffic capacity and reduce the energy consumption in the intelligent transportation system. Nevertheless, AVP without security guarantees are prone to various attacks, which probably lead to life-threatening accidents. Motivated by solving this issue, an outsourced attribute-based access control mechanism with direct revocation for AVP (RFAP) is introduced in this paper. Among them, attribute-based encryption is utilized to implement fine-grained access control during the encryption process. Furthermore, RFAP can not only realize the immediate revocation of platoon member who is about to leave the platoon without affecting others, but also achieve secure outsourced decryption with the help of edge computing units for minimizing the computational overhead of decryption on the vehicle side. Security analysis and simulation results indicate that our RFAP mechanism is practical in aspects of security and efficiency.	https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9523580	0
A Sequential Algorithm for Jerk Limited Speed Planning	In this article, we discuss a sequential algorithm for the computation of a minimum-time speed profile over a given path, under velocity, acceleration, and jerk constraints. Such a problem arises in industrial contexts, such as automated warehouses, where LGVs need to perform assigned tasks as fast as possible in order to increase productivity. It can be reformulated as an optimization problem with a convex objective function, linear velocity and acceleration constraints, and nonconvex jerk constraints, which, thus, represent the main source of the difficulty. While existing nonlinear programming (NLP) solvers can be employed for the solution of this problem, it turns out that the performance and robustness of such solvers can be enhanced by the sequential line-search algorithm proposed in this article. At each iteration, a feasible direction, with respect to the current feasible solution, is computed, and a step along such direction is taken in order to compute the next iterate. The computation of the feasible direction is based on the solution of a linearized version of the problem, and the solution of the linearized problem, through an approach that strongly exploits its special structure, represents the main contribution of this work. The efficiency of the proposed approach with respect to existing NLP solvers is proven through different computational experiments. Note to Practitioners—This article was motivated by the needs of LGV manufacturers. In particular, it presents an algorithm for computing the minimum-time speed law for an LGV along a preassigned path, respecting assigned velocity, acceleration, and jerk constraints. The solution algorithm should be: 1) fast, since speed planning is made continuously throughout the workday, not only when an LGV receives a new task but also during the execution of the task itself, since conditions may change, e.g., if the LGV has to be halted for security reasons and 2) reliable, i.e., it should return solutions of high quality, because a better speed profile allows to save time and even small percentage improvements, say a 5% improvement, has a considerable impact on the productivity of the warehouse, and, thus, determines a significant economic gain. The algorithm that we propose meets these two requirements, and we believe that it can be a useful tool for LGV manufacturers and users. It is obvious that the proposed method also applies to the speed planning problem for vehicles other than LGVs, e.g., road vehicles.	https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9566295	0
Robust Coordinated Hybrid Source Seeking With Obstacle Avoidance in Multivehicle Autonomous Systems	In multivehicle autonomous systems that operate under unknown or adversarial environments, it is a challenging task to simultaneously achieve source seeking and obstacle avoidance. Indeed, even for single-vehicle systems, smooth time-invariant feedback controllers based on navigation or barrier functions have been shown to be highly susceptible to arbitrarily small jamming signals that can induce instability in the closed-loop system, or that are able to stabilize spurious equilibria in the operational space. When the location of the source is further unknown, adaptive smooth source seeking dynamics based on averaging theory may suffer from similar limitations. In this article, we address this problem by introducing a class of novel distributed hybrid model-free controllers, that achieve robust source seeking and obstacle avoidance in multivehicle autonomous systems, with vehicles characterized by nonlinear continuous-time dynamics stabilizable by hybrid feedback. The hybrid source seeking law switches between a family of cooperative gradient-free controllers, derived from potential fields that satisfy mild invexity assumptions. The stability and robustness properties of the closed-loop system are analyzed using Lyapunov tools and singular perturbation theory for set-valued hybrid dynamical systems. The theoretical results are validated via numerical and experimental tests.	https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9345457	0
SFNet-N: An Improved SFNet Algorithm for Semantic Segmentation of Low-Light Autonomous Driving Road Scenes	In recent years, considerable progress has been made in semantic segmentation of images with favorable environments. However, the environmental perception of autonomous driving under adverse weather conditions is still very challenging. In particular, the low visibility at nighttime greatly affects driving safety. In this paper, we aim to explore image segmentation in low-light scenarios, thereby expanding the application range of autonomous vehicles. The segmentation algorithms for road scenes based on deep learning are highly dependent on the volume of images with pixel-level annotations. Considering the scarcity of labeled large-scale nighttime data, we performed synthetic data collection and data style transfer using images acquired in daytime based on the autonomous driving simulation platform and generative adversarial network, respectively. In addition, we also proposed a novel nighttime segmentation framework (SFNET-N) to effectively recognize objects in dark environments, aiming at the boundary blurring caused by low semantic contrast in low-illumination images. Specifically, the framework comprises a light enhancement network which introduces semantic information for the first time and a segmentation network with strong feature extraction capability. Extensive experiments with Dark Zurich-test and Nighttime Driving-test datasets show the effectiveness of our method compared with existing state-of-the art approaches, with 56.9% and 57.4% mIoU (mean of category-wise intersection-over-union) respectively. Finally, we also performed real-vehicle verification of the proposed models in road scenes of Zhenjiang city with poor lighting. The datasets are available at https://github.com/pupu-chenyanyan/semantic-segmentation-on-nightime.	https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9784832	0
A Synthetic Aperture UHF RFID Localization Method by Phase Unwrapping and Hyperbolic Intersection	The use of radio frequency identification (RFID) technology for the traceability of products throughout the production chain, warehouse management, and the retail network is spreading in the last years, especially in those industries in line with the concept of Industry 4.0. The last decade has seen the development of increasingly precise and high-performance methods for the localization of goods. This work proposes a reliable 2-D localization methodology that is faster and provides a competitive accuracy, concerning the state-of-the-art techniques. The proposed method leverages a phase-distance model and exploits the synthetic aperture approach and unwrapping techniques for facing phase ambiguity and multipath phenomena. Trilateration applied on consecutive phase readings allows finding hyperbolae as the localization solution space. Analytic calculus is used to compute intersections among the conics that estimate the tag position. An algorithm computes intersections quality to select the best estimation. Experimental tests are conducted to assess the quality of the proposed strategy. A mobile robot equipped with a reader antenna localizes in 2-D the tags placed in an indoor scenario and reconstructs the map of the environment through a simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM) algorithm. Note to Practitioners—A localization technology based on passive ultrahigh-frequency (UHF) radio frequency identification (RFID) is an enabling technology for intelligent warehouses, logistics, and retails. For this reason, this work presents a novel method to estimate the tag location with high accuracy. A reader antenna is mounted on an autonomous mobile robot that can move in an indoor or outdoor environment due to a simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM) algorithm. The motion of the antenna generates a synthetic aperture. The system receives the phase measurements from the RFID tags and generates a distance model through phase unwrapping. In such a way, the possible locations of the tags in the environment are generated, creating conics. The trilateration step is performed analytically, intersecting the obtained conics. The resulting estimations are very accurate and not computation expensive. Therefore, the proposed approach can be employed in any application where localizing objects is fundamental even when reduced computational power is available, e.g., in warehouses where the products are at known heights, or where the items are placed on a fixed infrastructure, such as high-shelves logistics, to produce the inventory of the tagged objects within each shelf.	https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9359354	0
Resilient Branching MPC for Multi-Vehicle Traffic Scenarios Using Adversarial Disturbance Sequences	An approach to resilient planning and control of autonomous vehicles in multi-vehicle traffic scenarios is proposed. The proposed method is based on model predictive control (MPC), where alternative predictions of the surrounding traffic are determined automatically such that they are intentionally adversarial to the ego vehicle. This provides robustness against the inherent uncertainty in traffic predictions. To reduce conservatism, an assumption that other agents are of no ill intent is formalized. Simulation results from highway driving scenarios show that the proposed method in real-time negotiates traffic situations out of scope for a nominal MPC approach and performs favorably to state-of-the-art reinforcement-learning approaches without requiring prior training. The results also show that the proposed method performs effectively, with the ability to prune disturbance sequences with a lower risk for the ego vehicle.	https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9760144	0
AdaptIDS: Adaptive Intrusion Detection for Mission-Critical Aerospace Vehicles	Aerospace and defense industries are particularly vulnerable to cyber threats given their sensitive nature, significantly extending the consequences of security breaches to the national level. Aerospace vehicles are augmented by cooperative control, intelligent, connected, and autonomous systems. The risk against such systems is further amplified due to commonly relying on the MIL-STD-1553 communication bus developed with a high focus on reliability and fault tolerance, albeit with security as a second priority. MIL-STD-1553 (a.k.a., STANAG 3838 by NATO) is a standard that describes a serial data communication bus primarily used in aerospace vehicles for military and civilian applications, including avionics, aircraft, and spacecraft data handling. In the absence of core security measures such as authentication, authorization, and encryption, the bus connecting sensitive functions, including autopilot, GPS, fuel valve switches, and other avionics equipment, is easily vulnerable to a wide range of attacks. This paper proposes, AdaptIDS, a novel adaptive intrusion detection system as a security analytics framework for the MIL-STD-1553 communication bus. AdaptIDS mainly adopts data science principles and leverages advanced deep learning techniques (i.e., the stacking ensemble) to boost its generalization capabilities for detecting unseen patterns of attacks in the dynamic changing environment of aerospace vehicles. Extensive experiments are conducted using two datasets generated from an open-source simulation system, reflecting dynamic real-life scenarios. The evaluation results demonstrate that our solution outperforms existing solutions with high detection effectiveness of 0.99 F1-measure and computational time efficiency.	https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9928421	0
Learning Interaction-Aware Guidance for Trajectory Optimization in Dense Traffic Scenarios	Autonomous navigation in dense traffic scenarios remains challenging for autonomous vehicles (AVs) because the intentions of other drivers are not directly observable and AVs have to deal with a wide range of driving behaviors. To maneuver through dense traffic, AVs must be able to reason how their actions affect others (interaction model) and exploit this reasoning to navigate through dense traffic safely. This paper presents a novel framework for interaction-aware motion planning in dense traffic scenarios. We explore the connection between human driving behavior and their velocity changes when interacting. Hence, we propose to learn, via deep Reinforcement Learning (RL), an interaction-aware policy providing global guidance about the cooperativeness of other vehicles to an optimization-based planner ensuring safety and kinematic feasibility through constraint satisfaction. The learned policy can reason and guide the local optimization-based planner with interactive behavior to pro-actively merge in dense traffic while remaining safe in case other vehicles do not yield. We present qualitative and quantitative results in highly interactive simulation environments (highway merging and unprotected left turns) against two baseline approaches, a learning-based and an optimization-based method. The presented results show that our method significantly reduces the number of collisions and increases the success rate with respect to both learning-based and optimization-based baselines.	https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9750012	0
Prototyping and Evaluation of Infrastructure-Assisted Transition of Control for Cooperative Automated Vehicles	Automated driving is now possible in diverse road and traffic conditions. However, there are still situations that automated vehicles cannot handle safely and efficiently. In this case, a Transition of Control (ToC) is necessary so that the driver takes control of the driving. Executing a ToC requires the driver to get full situation awareness of the driving environment. If the driver fails to get back the control in a limited time, a Minimum Risk Maneuver (MRM) is executed to bring the vehicle into a safe state (e.g., decelerating to full stop). The execution of ToCs requires some time and can cause traffic disruption and safety risks that increase if several vehicles execute ToCs/MRMs at similar times and in the same area. This study proposes to use novel C-ITS traffic management measures where the infrastructure exploits V2X communications to assist Connected and Automated Vehicles (CAVs) in the execution of ToCs. The infrastructure can suggest a spatial distribution of ToCs, and inform vehicles of the locations where they could execute a safe stop in case of MRM. This paper reports the first field operational tests that validate the feasibility and quantify the benefits of the proposed infrastructure-assisted ToC and MRM management. The paper also presents the CAV and roadside infrastructure prototypes implemented and used in the trials. The conducted field trials demonstrate that infrastructure-assisted traffic management solutions can reduce safety risks and traffic disruptions.	https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9369993	0
Horizontal Insertion of a Ring Onto a Shaft Using a Gantry Crane With Minimal Sensors	While manufacturing heavy and large machinery, the insertion of crane-hung heavy parts into horizontal holes is often required. This paper presents a method outlining the horizontal insertion of a ring onto a shaft using a gantry crane with a single cable attachment. We exploit the underactuated nature of the single-cable crane system to prevent the hung object from being over-constrained, and allow it to gently interact with the shaft. Simply measuring the tilt angle of the ring with an IMU as it interacts with the shaft face allows a robotic crane to estimate the direction of misalignment of the ring relative to the shaft. A 3D kinematic analysis of this tilting process is performed to obtain the conditions under which the tilting angle can be measured stably. Based on the analysis, a recursive procedure for reducing the misalignment is obtained, and its convergence conditions are discussed. Furthermore, the conditions for jamming-free horizontal insertion are obtained. The autonomous horizontal insertion method is implemented on an overhead crane robot to verify the algorithm and demonstrate the feasibility.	https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9795662	0
Tightly-Coupled Fusion of VINS and Motion Constraint for Autonomous Vehicle	In this paper, we develop a novel visual-inertial navigation system with motion constraint (VINS-Motion), which extends the visual-inertial navigation system (VINS) to incorporate vehicle motion information for improving the autonomous vehicles localization accuracy. We introduce the vehicle stop detection module in the pre-processing measurement procedure. During the back-end processing, if the vehicle is detected to be in a stopping state, we perform optimization based on the stop constraint to help eliminate the abnormal jitter of the estimated pose, thus ensuring the reasonability of the trajectory. Otherwise, besides the prior information, IMU measurement residual, and visual measurement residual utilized in VINS, vehicle orientation/velocity constraint built by Ackerman steering model is first exploited to constitute residuals. We minimize the sum of priors and Mahalanobis norms of three kinds of residuals to obtain a maximum posterior estimation, thus increasing system consistency and accuracy. The proposed approach is validated on public datasets and compared with state-of-the-art algorithms, which demonstrates that the motion constraint proposed in this paper improves the standard VINS performance and achieves significantly higher positioning accuracy.	https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9741341	0
PERFECT: Positional-Forgery Resistant Traffic Gap Estimation for Connected Intersection Management	Connected and Autonomous Vehicles (CAVs) are set to be the next global revolution in transportation. One of the major challenges in a CAV environment is handling the positional-forgery of Basic Safety Messages while calculating critical traffic gaps at a Stop Sign Gap Assist controlled intersection. Traditionally, positional-forgery has been handled by isolated instances of physical layer detection and correction mechanisms, which proved unreliable during the multi-hop and majority malicious vehicle scenarios. In this work, we propose a novel framework called Positional-forgEry Resistant traFfic gap Estimation for Connected inTersection management (PERFECT) that performs optimal traffic gap estimation even during multi-hop scenarios and majority malicious positional-forgery attacks. The framework reduces traffic gap estimation error during majority malicious scenarios by over 60%, keeps the average error within 8.17%–10.62% and minimizes the maximum error across a range of malicious situations.	https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9773976	0
Learning on the Job: Long-Term Behavioural Adaptation in Human-Robot Interactions	In this work, we propose a framework for allowing autonomous robots deployed for extended periods of time in public spaces to adapt their own behaviour online from user interactions. The robot behaviour planning is embedded in a Reinforcement Learning (RL) framework, where the objective is maximising the level of overall user engagement during the interactions. We use the Upper-Confidence-Bound Value-Iteration (UCBVI) algorithm, which gives a helpful way of managing the exploration-exploitation trade-off for real-time interactions. An engagement model trained end-to-end generates the reward function in real-time during policy execution. We test this approach in a public museum in Lincoln (U.K.), where the robot is deployed as a tour guide for the visitors. Results show that after a couple of months of exploration, the robot policy learned to maintain the engagement of users for longer, with an increase of 22.8% over the initial static policy in the number of items visited during the tour and a 30% increase in the probability of completing the tour. This work is a promising step toward behavioural adaptation in long-term scenarios for robotics applications in social settings.	https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9785458	0
Minimum-Time Quadrotor Waypoint Flight in Cluttered Environments	We tackle the problem of planning a minimum-time trajectory for a quadrotor over a sequence of specified waypoints in the presence of obstacles while exploiting the full quadrotor dynamics. This problem is crucial for autonomous search and rescue and drone racing scenarios but was, so far, unaddressed by the robotics community in its entirety due to the challenges of minimizing time in the presence of the non-convex constraints posed by collision avoidance. Early works relied on simplified dynamics or polynomial trajectory representations that did not exploit the full actuator potential of a quadrotor and, thus, did not aim at minimizing time. We address this challenging problem by using a hierarchical, sampling-based method with an incrementally more complex quadrotor model. Our method first finds paths in different topologies to guide subsequent trajectory search for a kinodynamic point-mass model. Then, it uses an asymptotically-optimal, kinodynamic sampling-based method based on a full quadrotor model on top of the point-mass solution to find a feasible trajectory with a time-optimal objective. The proposed method is shown to outperform all related baselines in cluttered environments and is further validated in real-world flights at over 60 km/h in one of the world’s largest motion capture systems. We release the code open source.	https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9721033	0
Efficient Federated Learning With Spike Neural Networks for Traffic Sign Recognition	With the gradual popularization of self-driving, it is becoming increasingly important for vehicles to smartly make the right driving decisions and autonomously obey traffic rules by correctly recognizing traffic signs. However, for machine learning-based traffic sign recognition on the Internet of Vehicles (IoV), a large amount of traffic sign data from distributed vehicles is needed to be gathered in a centralized server for model training, which brings serious privacy leakage risk because of traffic sign data containing lots of location privacy information. To address this issue, we first exploit privacy-preserving federated learning to perform collaborative training for accurate recognition models without sharing raw traffic sign data. Nevertheless, due to the limited computing and energy resources of most devices, it is hard for vehicles to continuously undertake complex artificial intelligence tasks. Therefore, we introduce powerful Spike Neural Networks (SNNs) into traffic sign recognition for energy-efficient and fast model training, which is the next generation of neural networks and is practical and well-fitted to IoV scenarios. Furthermore, we design a novel encoding scheme for SNNs based on neuron receptive fields to extract information from the pixel and spatial dimensions of traffic signs to achieve high-accuracy training. Numerical results indicate that the proposed federated SNN outperforms traditional federated convolutional neural networks in terms of accuracy, noise immunity, and energy efficiency as well.	https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9784851	0
Trajectory Planning Based on Spatio-Temporal Map With Collision Avoidance Guaranteed by Safety Strip	Trajectory planning for the unmanned vehicle in the complex environment has always been a challenging task. Planned trajectory with the corresponding target velocity or acceleration sequence must be collision-free guaranteed and as comfortable as possible on the premise of obeying the traffic rules and interaction with other dynamic social vehicles. To meet this requirement, this paper proposes a framework for trajectory planning based on spatio-temporal map. Due to the time layer architecture in the map, the trajectory can be generated with velocity and acceleration simultaneously, and the whole trajectory is constrained within a ‘safety strip’, resulting in an efficient and safety guaranteed trajectory. The framework is composed of three sections: rough search, fine optimization and safety strip-based collision avoidance. For rough search, we propose an improved A* algorithm implemented in the discrete time layer to find out the suboptimal states efficiently. In fine optimization, the B-spline curve is exploited to connect the searched states into a continuous trajectory. And the optimal control points of B-spline are further grouped into several segments, forming the safety strip which is actually the distribution space of the planned trajectory. If necessary, an adjustment will be applied to keep the strip away from the collision zone, making the entire trajectory completely collision-free. Experiments on both public dataset and self-driving simulator show that the proposed framework can adapt to different kinds of complex traffic scenes well.	https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9190057	0
Handling Concurrency in Behavior Trees	This article addresses the concurrency issues affecting behavior trees (BTs), a popular tool to model the behaviors of autonomous agents in the video game and the robotics industry. BT designers can easily build complex behaviors composing simpler ones, which represents a key advantage of BTs. The parallel composition of BTs expresses a way to combine concurrent behaviors that has high potential, since composing pre-existing BTs in parallel results easier than composing in parallel classical control architectures, as finite state machines or teleo-reactive programs. However, BT designers rarely use such composition due to the underlying concurrency problems similar to the ones faced in concurrent programming. As a result, the parallel composition, despite its potential, finds application only in the composition of simple behaviors or where the designer can guarantee the absence of conflicts by design. In this article, we define two new BT nodes to tackle the concurrency problems in BTs and we show how to exploit them to create predictable behaviors. In addition, we introduce measures to assess execution performance and show how different design choices affect them. We validate our approach in both simulations and the real world. Simulated experiments provide statistically significant data, whereas real-world experiments show the applicability of our method on real robots.

Blockchain-Empowered Decentralized Horizontal Federated Learning for 5G-Enabled UAVs	Motivated by Industry 4.0, 5G-enabled unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs; also known as drones) are widely applied in various industries. However, the open nature of 5G networks threatens the safe sharing of data. In particular, privacy leakage can lead to serious losses for users. As a new machine learning paradigm, federated learning (FL) avoids privacy leakage by allowing data models to be shared instead of raw data. Unfortunately, the traditional FL framework is strongly dependent on a centralized aggregation server, which will cause the system to crash if the server is compromised. Unauthorized participants may launch poisoning attacks, thereby reducing the usability of models. In addition, communication barriers hinder collaboration among a large number of cross-domain devices for learning. To address the abovementioned issues, a blockchain-empowered decentralized horizontal FL framework is proposed. The authentication of cross-domain UAVs is accomplished through multisignature smart contracts. Global model updates are computed by using these smart contracts instead of a centralized server. Extensive experimental results show that the proposed scheme achieves high efficiency of cross-domain authentication and good accuracy.	https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9551794	0
Autonomous Source Term Estimation in Unknown Environments: From a Dual Control Concept to UAV Deployment	In the gas source search and localisation problem, the use of autonomous robots is of increasing interest due to their deployment speed and lack of human interaction with hazardous materials. This letter presents an aerial robotic platform for performing source term estimation of an unknown chemical release in a challenging a-priori unknown and GPS-denied environment. The proposed system forms the search strategy using the state-of-the-art control concept, dual control for exploitation and exploration, and realises such a function in the aforementioned challenging scenario using an RRT* based path planner. A novel downsampling process on the RRT* is also proposed that addresses the computational infeasibility of calculating the utility of a large number of sample states, whilst still maintaining sample state diversity. The proposed algorithm is tested in a high fidelity simulation environment under a number of configurations, and compared against competing algorithms. The system architecture is also brought forward into a bespoke UAV platform and experimentally tested in real-world conditions. The proposed system is shown to be capable of performing source term estimation robustly and efficiently, which provides a step forward in showing the real world application of previously academic functions.	https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9684970	0
Certifiable Robustness to Adversarial State Uncertainty in Deep Reinforcement Learning	Deep neural network-based systems are now state-of-the-art in many robotics tasks, but their application in safety-critical domains remains dangerous without formal guarantees on network robustness. Small perturbations to sensor inputs (from noise or adversarial examples) are often enough to change network-based decisions, which was recently shown to cause an autonomous vehicle to swerve into another lane. In light of these dangers, numerous algorithms have been developed as defensive mechanisms from these adversarial inputs, some of which provide formal robustness guarantees or certificates. This work leverages research on certified adversarial robustness to develop an online certifiably robust for deep reinforcement learning algorithms. The proposed defense computes guaranteed lower bounds on state-action values during execution to identify and choose a robust action under a worst case deviation in input space due to possible adversaries or noise. Moreover, the resulting policy comes with a certificate of solution quality, even though the true state and optimal action are unknown to the certifier due to the perturbations. The approach is demonstrated on a deep Q-network (DQN) policy and is shown to increase robustness to noise and adversaries in pedestrian collision avoidance scenarios, a classic control task, and Atari Pong. This article extends our prior work with new performance guarantees, extensions to other reinforcement learning algorithms, expanded results aggregated across more scenarios, an extension into scenarios with adversarial behavior, comparisons with a more computationally expensive method, and visualizations that provide intuition about the robustness algorithm.	https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9354500	0
Federated Vehicular Transformers and Their Federations: Privacy-Preserving Computing and Cooperation for Autonomous Driving	Cooperative computing is promising to enhance the performance and safety of autonomous vehicles benefiting from the increase in the amount, diversity as well as scope of data resources. However, effective and privacy-preserving utilization of multi-modal and multi-source data remains an open challenge during the construction of cooperative mechanisms. Recently, Transformers have demonstrated their potential in the unified representation of multi-modal features, which provides a new perspective for effective representation and fusion of diverse inputs of intelligent vehicles. Federated learning proposes a distributed learning scheme and is hopeful to achieve privacy-secure sharing of data resources among different vehicles. Towards privacy-preserving computing and cooperation in autonomous driving, this paper reviews recent progress of Transformers, federated learning as well as cooperative perception, and proposes a hierarchical structure of Transformers for intelligent vehicles which is comprised of Vehicular Transformers, Federated Vehicular Transformers and the Federation of Vehicular Transformers to exploit their potential in privacy-preserving collaboration.	https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9857660	0
Chiller Fault Diagnosis Based on VAE-Enabled Generative Adversarial Networks	Artificial intelligence (AI)-enhanced automated fault diagnosis (AFD) has become increasingly popular for chiller fault diagnosis with promising classification performance. In practice, a sufficient number of fault samples are required by the AI methods in the training phase. However, faulty training samples are generally much more difficult to be collected than normal training samples. Data augmentation is introduced in these scenarios to enhance the training data set with synthetic data. In this study, a variational autoencoder-based conditional Wasserstein GAN with gradient penalty (CWGAN-GP-VAE) is proposed to diagnose various faults for chillers. A detailed comparative study has been conducted with real-world fault data samples to verify the effectiveness and robustness of the proposed methodology. Note to Practitioners—This work attacks the fact that faulty training samples are usually much harder to be collected than the normal training samples in the practice of chiller automated fault diagnosis (AFD). Modern supervised learning chiller AFD relies on a sufficient number of faulty training samples to train the classifier. When the number of faulty training samples is insufficient, the conventional AFD methods fail to work. This study proposed a variational autoencoder-based conditional Wasserstein GAN with gradient penalty (CWGAN-GP-VAE) framework for generating synthetic faulty training samples to enrich the training data set for machine learning-based AFD methods. The proposed algorithm has been carefully designed, implemented, and practically proved to be more effective than the existing methods in the literature.	https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9264218	0
Automatic Jamming Signal Classification in Cognitive UAV Radios	The integration of Cognitive Radio (CR) with Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) is an effective step towards relieving the spectrum scarcity and empowering the UAV with a high degree of intelligence. The dynamic nature of CR and the dominant line-of-sight links of UAVs poses serious security challenges and make the CR-UAV prone to a variety of attacks as malicious jamming. Joint jammer detection and automatic jammer classification is a powerful approach against the physical layer threats by identifying multiple jammers attacking the network that realize a crucial stage towards efficient interference management. This paper proposes a novel method for joint detection and automatic classification of multiple jammers attacking with different modulation schemes. The method is based on learning a representation of the radio environment encoded in a Generalized Dynamic Bayesian Network (GDBN) whilst multiple GDBN models represent various jamming signals under different modulation schemes. The CR-UAV performs multiple predictions online in parallel and evaluates multiple abnormality measurements based on a Modified Markov Jump Particle Filter (M-MJPF) to select the best-fit model that explains the detected jammer and recognize the modulation scheme accordingly. The simulated results demonstrate that the proposed GDBN-based method outperforms Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM), Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) and Stacked Autoencoder (SAE) in terms of classification accuracy and achieves a higher degree of explainability of its own decisions by interpreting causes and effects at hierarchical levels under the Bayesian learning and reasoning processes.	https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9858012	0
Improving Pedestrian Prediction Models With Self-Supervised Continual Learning	Autonomous mobile robots require accurate human motion predictions to safely and efficiently navigate among pedestrians, whose behavior may adapt to environmental changes. This letter introduces a self-supervised continual learning framework to improve data-driven pedestrian prediction models online across various scenarios continuously. In particular, we exploit online streams of pedestrian data, commonly available from the robot&#x2019;s detection and tracking pipeline, to refine the prediction model and its performance in unseen scenarios. To avoid the forgetting of previously learned concepts, a problem known as catastrophic forgetting, our framework includes a regularization loss to penalize changes of model parameters that are important for previous scenarios and retrains on a set of previous examples to retain past knowledge. Experimental results on real and simulation data show that our approach can improve prediction performance in unseen scenarios while retaining knowledge from seen scenarios when compared to naively training the prediction model online.	https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9705542	0
Service-Oriented Real-Time Energy-Optimal Regenerative Braking Strategy for Connected and Autonomous Electrified Vehicles	This paper presents a real-time vehicle speed planning system called the real-time energy-optimal deceleration planning system (RT-EDPS). Connectivity and autonomous driving technologies that provide map and navigation data, traffic light information, and front detection sensor data are exploited to perceive and forecast upcoming deceleration events. A parameterized polynomial-based deceleration model is employed as the deceleration strategy. Real driving test data that characterize the physical limits of regenerative braking are used to model the objective function and constraints of the parameterized deceleration commands. The proposed RT-EDPS involves two speed-planning strategies with different scales of the planning horizon. Within a deceleration event horizon ascertained by the signal phase and timing data of traffic signals and 3D geographic map data, a dynamic programming-based energy-efficient deceleration strategy is used to generate long-sighted speed profiles. While the scheduled vehicle speed is being tracked, if a preceding vehicle is detected within a predefined threshold range, then a model predictive control-based energy-efficient deceleration strategy that incorporates the traffic status ahead of the ego vehicle and exploits V2V communication with the preceding vehicles is activated to re-plan the speed trajectory of the vehicle to guarantee a collision-free distance for the preceding vehicle. In virtual driving experiments, we record energy-recuperation efficiency gains of over 40% as compared to human drivers.	https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9507047	0
Multi-PPTP: Multiple Probabilistic Pedestrian Trajectory Prediction in the Complex Junction Scene	Pedestrian trajectory prediction in dynamic, multi-agent traffic junction scene is an important problem in the context of self-driving cars. Accurately predicting the trajectory of the agent, especially the pedestrian with high randomness, is of great significance to autonomous driving technology. In this paper, we propose Multi-PPTP, a novel trajectory prediction model that first utilizes a composite rasterized map to model the complex representations and interactions of road components, including dynamic obstacles (e.g., pedestrians, vehicles, and cyclists) and static road information (e.g., lanes, traffic lights, and sidewalks). Then it uses MapNet and AgentNet to extract spatio-temporal features by deep convolutional networks and LSTM to automatically derive relevant features, and next exploits Interaction-AttNet aggregate features to learn the high interactions among all components by affine transformation and multi-head attention mechanism. Additionally, we also propose a series of unique loss functions to predict multiple possible trajectories of each pedestrian while estimating their probabilities. Following extensive offline evaluation and comparison to the state-of-the-art models, our approach outperforms significantly the state-of-the-art models on our large scale in-house and public nuScenes dataset.	https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9619864	0
Perceptual Enhancement for Autonomous Vehicles: Restoring Visually Degraded Images for Context Prediction via Adversarial Training	Realizing autonomous vehicles is one of the ultimate dreams for humans. However, perceptual information collected by sensors in dynamic and complicated environments, in particular, vision information, may exhibit various types of degradation. This may lead to mispredictions of context followed by more severe consequences. Thus, it is necessary to improve degraded images before employing them for context prediction. To this end, we propose a generative adversarial network to restore images from common types of degradation. The proposed model features a novel architecture with an inverse and a reverse module to address additional attributes between image styles. With the supplementary information, the decoding for restoration can be more precise. In addition, we develop a loss function to stabilize the adversarial training with better training efficiency for the proposed model. Compared with several state-of-the-art methods, the proposed method can achieve better restoration performance with high efficiency. It is highly reliable for assisting in context prediction in autonomous vehicles.	https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9585517	0
Identification of Mangrove Invasive Plant Derris Trifoliate Using UAV Images and Deep Learning Algorithms	Derris trifoliate, one of the most notorious invaders of mangroves in South China, seriously threatens the growth of mangroves and the stability of local ecosystem. In order to effectively control the spread of Derris trifoliate and stabilize the mangrove ecosystem, it is necessary to identify the distribution and simulate the occurrence of Derris trifoliate in mangrove forests. While previous methods for invasive plant mapping based on satellite images were limited by low temporal and spatial resolution, the newly born unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) images have provided a fast, fine-grained, and low-cost alternative for rapid invasive plant monitoring. However, extracting Derris trifoliate in mangrove forests based on UAV images is still a challenge. For one thing, it is difficult to collect enough data for model training, since the Derris trifoliate is hard to be distinguished in mangroves. For another thing, few existing methods can meet the requirements of high computing efficiency and low memory consumption of UAVs. Therefore, we proposed two lightweight deep learning networks based on DenseNet and VGG, namely, the lightweight DenseNet (LDN) and the lightweight VGG (LVG), and investigated the capability of LDN and LVG in identifying Derris trifoliate from mangrove forests with small amounts of data. This study has verified the effect of the lightweight deep learning algorithms for the accurate detection of mangrove invasive plants Derris trifoliate from UAV images.	https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9954894	0
Quasi-Static FEA Model for a Multi-Material Soft Pneumatic Actuator in SOFA	The increasing interest in soft robotics has led to new designs that exploit the combination of multiple materials, increasing robustness and enhancing performance. However, the combination of multiple non-linear materials makes modelling and eventual control of these highly flexible systems challenging. This article presents a methodology to model multi-material soft pneumatic actuators using finite element analysis (FEA), based on (hyper)elastic constitutive laws fitted on experimental material characterisation. Modelling in SOFA, a FEA software, allows to simulate and control in real-time soft robotic structures. One of the novelties presented in this paper is the development of a new user-friendly technique for the mesh partitioning in SOFA, using MATLAB algorithms, that allow the creation of uniform and more refined meshes and a mesh domain partitioning that can be adapted for any geometry. As a case study, a cylindrical multi-material soft pneumatic actuator is considered. It is composed of an internal chamber, which is constituted of an autonomous self-healing hydrogel, modelled as a hyperelastic material, and an external elastic reinforcement, made of thermoplastic polyether-polyurethane elastomer (TPPU), approached as a linear elastic material. The simulation of the combination of a hyperelastic and a linear elastic material in a single design is another contribution of this work to the scientific literature of SOFA simulations. Finally, the multi-material model obtained with the new mesh partitioning technique is simulated in quasi-static conditions and is experimentally validated, demonstrating an accurate fit between simulation and reality.	https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9796587	0
Threat sequencing of multiple UCAVs with incomplete information based on game theory	The threat sequencing of multiple unmanned combat air vehicles (UCAVs) is a multi-attribute decision-making (MADM) problem. In the threat sequencing process of multiple UCAVs, due to the strong confrontation and high dynamics of the air combat environment, the weight coefficients of the threat indicators are usually time-varying. Moreover, the air combat data is difficult to be obtained accurately. In this study, a threat sequencing method of multiple UCAVs is proposed based on game theory by considering the incomplete information. Firstly, a zero-sum game model of decision maker ($\mathcal{D}$) and nature ($\mathcal{N}$) with fuzzy payoffs is established to obtain the uncertain parameters which are the weight coefficient parameters of the threat indicators and the interval parameters of the threat matrix. Then, the established zero-sum game with fuzzy payoffs is transformed into a zero-sum game with crisp payoffs (matrix game) to solve. Moreover, a decision rule is addressed for the threat sequencing problem of multiple UCAVs based on the obtained uncertain parameters. Finally, numerical simulation results are presented to show the effectiveness of the proposed approach.	https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9885010	0
String Stable and Collision-Safe Model Predictive Platoon Control	Automated vehicle platooning bears high potential to increase traffic efficiency, improve road safety, and reduce fuel consumption. To realize platoons with small inter-vehicle distances, collision safety is the most crucial concern and needs to be considered carefully. Moreover, it is desired to attenuate disturbances along the platoon which is known as string stability. While model predictive control concepts achieve efficient, situation-aware, and safe platooning, establishing string stability properties is difficult. In this work string stability is characterized for a generic feedback setting. A workflow to design an extended time gap spacing policy is proposed for a safety-extended distributed model predictive platooning controller. It provides safe, tightly-packed platoon operation with robust string stability near steady-state even without vehicle-to-vehicle- V2V-communication. Platoon performance is further improved by exploiting V2V-communication. Finally, the resulting closed-loop platoon dynamics are validated in a high-fidelity co-simulation study.	https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9744601	0
Measurement-Based Optimal Stealthy Attacks on Remote State Estimation	This paper focuses on designing measurement-based optimal stealthy attacks for linear cyber-physical systems (CPSs), where attackers aim to deteriorate the performance of remote state estimation and keep  $\epsilon $ -stealthy to Kullback-Leibler divergence detector. Instead of constructing a linear attack directly, we consider a more general attack model with an arbitrary distribution to reveal the correlations between attacks and the stealth level  $\epsilon $ . By solving a convex optimization problem, the mean and variance of optimal attacks on common unprotected systems are obtained. Not limited to zero mean Gaussian attacks, the derived optimal attacks can also obey non-zero mean Gaussian distribution and degenerate to the former in some special cases. For protected systems equipped with encryption procedures, a general criterion for the selection of attacked channels is given. Finally, an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) example is provided to verify the effectiveness of the theoretical results.	https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9900373	0
Smart Card-Based Identity Management Protocols for V2V and V2I Communications in CCAM: A Systematic Literature Review	Besides developing new Cooperative, Connected and Automated Mobility (CCAM) services for the improvement of road safety and travel experience, researchers are considering protection mechanisms to ensure the security of these services and the safety of involved users (drivers but also, e.g., cyclists and pedestrians). In particular, several Identity Management (IDM) protocols have been designed as the first line of defence against external attackers. Among these protocols, a promising trend in research consists in the use of a Smart Card (SC) as a technical enabler for strong authentication. Indeed, many SC-based IDM protocols for Vehicle-to-Vehicle (V2V) and Vehicle-to-Infrastructure (V2I) communications in real-time CCAM services have been proposed in the literature which present interesting features and promising usability experimental results. However, this research line is far from being exhausted, especially considering the recent spread of SC technologies and use cases. For this reason, in this paper we propose a systematic literature review on SC-based IDM protocols for real-time CCAM services. In particular, we identify characterising assumptions of CCAM scenarios and extrapolate a unified high-level view of the steps composing a SC-based IDM protocol. Then, we present a detailed survey of several SC-based IDM protocols. Finally, we identify trends in research and formulate guidelines and useful recommendations to provide a solid base which researchers can use as a starting point for the design of new and improved SC-based IDM protocols for CCAM scenarios.	https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9576545	0
Safety Control for Quadrotor UAV Against Ground Effect and Blade Damage	This article proposes a safety control scheme for quadrotor unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) to counteract ground effect and blade damage. The impacts of ground effect and blade damage are quantitatively analyzed in the established model. The proposed safety control scheme consists of position and attitude loops. Specifically, a proportional and derivative controller is designed as a baseline control with acceleration feedforward in the position loop. A disturbance observer (DO) using the measured Euler angles is exploited to estimate the lumped disturbance forces. The developed DO can effectively mitigate the estimation deviation caused by the angle tracking error. Subsequently, differential flatness theory is used to obtain the Euler angle references and the derivatives. In the attitude loop, sliding mode control and fixed-time sliding mode observer (SMO) are integrated to deal with ground effect and blade damage promptly. To demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed safety control scheme, flight experiments are carried out, where the quadrotor UAV flies close to the rugged ground in the presence of blade damage.	https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9677985	0
Accelerating Monte Carlo Bayesian Prediction via Approximating Predictive Uncertainty Over the Simplex	Estimating the predictive uncertainty of a Bayesian learning model is critical in various decision-making problems, e.g., reinforcement learning, detecting the adversarial attack, self-driving car. As the model posterior is almost always intractable, most efforts were made on finding an accurate approximation to the true posterior. Even though a decent estimation of the model posterior is obtained, another approximation is required to compute the predictive distribution over the desired output. A common accurate solution is to use Monte Carlo (MC) integration. However, it needs to maintain a large number of samples, and evaluate the model repeatedly, and average multiple model outputs. In many real-world cases, this is computationally prohibitive. In this work, assuming that the exact posterior or a decent approximation is obtained, we propose a generic framework to approximate the output probability distribution induced by the model posterior with a parameterized model and in an amortized fashion. The aim is to approximate the predictive uncertainty of a specific Bayesian model, meanwhile alleviating the heavy workload of MC integration at testing time. The proposed method is universally applicable to Bayesian classification models that allow for posterior sampling. Theoretically, we show that the idea of amortization incurs no additional costs on approximation performance. Empirical results validate the strong practical performance of our approach.	https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9305977	0
Graph-Based Intrusion Detection System for Controller Area Networks	The controller area network (CAN) is the most widely used intra-vehicular communication network in the automotive industry. Because of its simplicity in design, it lacks most of the requirements needed for a security-proven communication protocol. However, a safe and secured environment is imperative for autonomous as well as connected vehicles. Therefore CAN security is considered one of the important topics in the automotive research community. In this article, we propose a four-stage intrusion detection system that uses the chi-squared method and can detect any kind of strong and weak cyber attacks in a CAN. This work is the first-ever graph-based defense system proposed for the CAN. Our experimental results show that we have a very low 5.26% misclassification for denial of service (DoS) attack, 10% misclassification for fuzzy attack, 4.76% misclassification for replay attack, and no misclassification for spoofing attack. In addition, the proposed methodology exhibits up to 13.73% better accuracy compared to existing ID sequence-based methods.	https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9210546	0
Autonomous Maneuver Decisions via Transfer Learning Pigeon-Inspired Optimization for UCAVs in Dogfight Engagements	This paper proposes an autonomous maneuver decision method using transfer learning pigeon-inspired optimization (TLPIO) for unmanned combat aerial vehicles (UCAVs) in dogfight engagements. Firstly, a nonlinear F-16 aircraft model and automatic control system are constructed by a MATLAB/Simulink platform. Secondly, a 3-degrees-of-freedom (3-DOF) aircraft model is used as a maneuvering command generator, and the expanded elemental maneuver library is designed, so that the aircraft state reachable set can be obtained. Then, the game matrix is composed with the air combat situation evaluation function calculated according to the angle and range threats. Finally, a key point is that the objective function to be optimized is designed using the game mixed strategy, and the optimal mixed strategy is obtained by TLPIO. Significantly, the proposed TLPIO does not initialize the population randomly, but adopts the transfer learning method based on Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence to initialize the population, which improves the search accuracy of the optimization algorithm. Besides, the convergence and time complexity of TLPIO are discussed. Comparison analysis with other classical optimization algorithms highlights the advantage of TLPIO. In the simulation of air combat, three initial scenarios are set, namely, opposite, offensive and defensive conditions. The effectiveness performance of the proposed autonomous maneuver decision method is verified by simulation results.	https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9864998	0
UAV-Assisted Physical Layer Security in Multi-Beam Satellite-Enabled Vehicle Communications	In this paper, we investigate unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) assisted physical layer security in multi-beam satellite enabled vehicle communications. Particularly, the UAV is exploited as a relay to improve the secure satellite-to-vehicle link, and simultaneously serves as a jammer by deliberately generating artificial noise (AN) to confuse Eve. The satellite beamforming (BF) and UAV power allocation (PA) are jointly optimized to maximize the secrecy rate of the legitimate user within a target beam while guaranteeing the quality of service (QoS) of users within other beams. Since the problem is nonconvex, we first convert it into an equivalent two-stage problem. Then, the outer-stage problem is solved by using one-dimensional search, and the inner-stage problem is transformed to a bi-convex problem by using the semi-definite relaxation (SDR) and Charnes Cooper transformation. To solve the inner-stage bi-convex problem, we propose an iterative alternating optimization algorithm, where the optimal BF is obtained by semi-definite programming (SDP), and the optimal UAV PA is subsequently obtained by solving the reformulated fractional programming problem with an iterative Dinkelbach method. The tightness of SDR and the complexity of our proposed approach are analyzed, and extensive simulations are carried out to evaluate the effectiveness of our proposed approach.	https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9463880	0
A3C-Based Intelligent Event-Triggering Control of Networked Nonlinear Unmanned Marine Vehicles Subject to Hybrid Attacks	This paper is concerned with the intelligent event-triggering-based positioning control of networked unmanned marine vehicle (UMV) systems with hybrid attacks, where the UMV and control station is connected by a communication network and the DoS attack and Deception attack are studied. Firstly, a stochastic switched Takagi-Sugeno (T-S) fuzzy system model is proposed for the networked nonlinear UMV systems subject to aperiodic DoS attack and random Deception attack. Then, a novel asynchronous advantage actor-critic (A3C) learning-based event-triggering approach is introduced to alleviate the communication load. By using the Lyapunov stability theory and switched system analysis method, the mean-square exponential stability condition of the closed-loop system and the design method of observer-based controller are devised. Finally, an example of a networked UMV system is given to verify the effectiveness of the proposed resilient control strategy.	https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9582736	0
Toward Trusted and Secure Communication Among Multiple Internal Modules in CAV	By equipping various sensors and analyzing sensed data, vehicles can perform automatic driving; these vehicles are known as connected and autonomous vehicles (CAVs). In CAVs, tampered data will result in incorrect driving decisions. Hence, secure data transmission should be ensured to enable correct life-critical decisions. Untrusted resource-constrained modules allow attackers to obtain private data from CAVs, such as the key. Benefitting from trusted computing, the proposed scheme can verify the trusted status of internal modules and achieve secure data transmission by adopting the remote attestation and hash message authentication code. The scheme is proven to be secure in the random oracle model under the computational Diffie–Hellman problem. Furthermore, we perform experiments and evaluate the performance using Intel Software Guard eXtensions, which provide part of the trusted computing function. The experimental results show that the scheme could be efficient and suitable for CAVs.	https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9438685	0
Robust Resource Allocation Algorithm for Energy-Harvesting-Based D2D Communication Underlaying UAV-Assisted Networks	Energy efficiency (EE) is a significant performance indicator in unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV)-assisted communication networks for providing a balance between power consumption minimization and transmission rate maximization. However, most of the current works focus on the transmission rate maximization under perfect channel state information (CSI) and exact coordinate information, which is too ideal in practical systems due to channel estimation errors and coordinate estimation errors. Thus, robust resource allocation algorithms with imperfect CSI and coordinate information are critically important to reduce users’ outages and improve system robustness. In this article, a robust EE maximization problem with channel uncertainties and coordinate uncertainties is formulated for an energy harvesting-based device-to-device (D2D) communication underlaying UAV-assisted network under some necessary constraints, which involve the outage probability constraints of ground terminals, the flight altitude constraint of the UAV, the minimum harvested energy constraints of D2D users, and the transmission time constraint. Both radio resource allocation and the flight altitude are jointly optimized based on the worst case approach. The considered nonconvex problem is transformed into a convex one by exploiting variable relaxation and variable substitution approaches. The Lagrange dual theory is used to derive the closed-form expressions of robust resource allocation. Simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm by comparing it with the benchmark algorithms in terms of EE and robustness.	https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9425525	0
Interdependence-Aware Game-Theoretic Framework for Secure Intelligent Transportation Systems	The operation of future intelligent transportation systems (ITSs), communications infrastructure (CI), and power grids (PGs) will be highly interdependent. In particular, autonomous connected vehicles require CI resources to operate, and, thus, communication failures can result in nonoptimality in the ITS flow in terms of traffic jams and fuel consumption. Similarly, CI components, e.g., base stations (BSs) can be impacted by failures in the electric grid that is powering them. Thus, malicious attacks on the PG can lead to failures in both the CI and the ITSs. To this end, in this article, the security of an ITS against indirect attacks carried out through the PG is studied in an interdependent PG-CI-ITS scenario. In the considered scenario, an attacker can induce nonoptimality in the ITS or disrupt a particular set of streets by attacking the PG components while remaining stealthy from the ITS administrators. To defend against such attacks, the administrator of the interdependent critical infrastructure can allocate backup power sources (BPSs) at every BS to compensate for the power loss caused by the attacker. However, due to budget limitations, the administrator must consider the importance of each BS in light of the PG risk of failure, while allocating the BPSs. In this regard, a rigorous analytical framework is proposed to model the interdependencies between the ITS, CI, and PG. Next, a one-to-one relationship between the PG components and ITS streets is derived in order to capture the effect of the PG components’ failure on the optimality of the traffic flow in the streets. Moreover, the problem of BPS allocation is formulated using a Stackelberg game framework and the Stackelberg equilibrium (SE) of the game is characterized. Simulation results show that the derived SE outperforms any other BPS allocation strategy and can be scalable in linear time with respect to the size of the interdependent infrastructure.	https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9184000	0
An Efficient Strategy for Accurate Detection and Localization of UAV Swarms	Unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) swarms have shown great potential for Internet of Things (IoT). Meantime, its malicious use may cause huge threat to the national security. UAV swarms show the characteristic of high density which poses formidable challenges to radar resolution in the defense of critical areas. In this article, we consider a radar equipped with the coprime array, and then, use the coherent long-time integration (LTI) technique and gridless sparse technique to detect and localize UAVs in a swarm. This strategy takes full account of advantages of the coprime array, coherent LTI technique, and gridless sparse technique, i.e.: 1) the coprime array can provide a larger array aperture than the uniform linear array with the same number of array elements to relieve the stress of the gridless sparse technique and 2) the combination of coherent LTI technique and gridless sparse technique can maximize their advantages and make up for their shortcomings. By mathematical analyses and extensive numerical examples, we show the superiority of the proposed strategy in terms of accurate detection and localization of UAV swarms.	https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9372970	0
Intelligent Drone-assisted Anonymous Authentication and Key Agreement for 5G/B5G Vehicular Ad-Hoc Networks	Drones (or unmanned aerial vehicles) can play many assistant roles in the complex communication network, and can be used as an air relay node to support ground communications. It is expected to solve the sustainable communication problem of 5G/ beyond 5G (B5G) vehicular ad-hoc networks by using drones in rural or mountainous areas where communication is limited. In this paper, considering the emergency of vehicular ad-hoc networks, we design an assistant communication scheme based on the intelligent drone to help vehicles securely communicate with each other under adversary but actual conditions. Besides, the real identity of the vehicle must also be protected to prevent illegal elements from obtaining, and using them for crimes. To effectively assist vehicle communication, and ensure that vehicle privacy is not compromised, we propose an intelligent drone-assisted anonymous authentication, and key agreement for 5G/B5G vehicular ad-hoc networks. Utilizing the widely-used Real-Or-Random (ROR) model, and the formal security analysis, the proposed scheme is proven to be resistant to several attacks. Moreover, the proposed scheme has better performance in terms of computation overhead, and communication overhead through performance evaluation.	https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9219201	0
The Optimal and the Greedy: Drone Association and Positioning Schemes for Internet of UAVs	This work considers the deployment of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) over a predefined area to serve a number of ground users. Due to the heterogeneous nature of the network, the UAVs may cause severe interference to the transmissions of each other. Hence, a judicious design of the user-UAV association and UAV locations is desired. A potential game is defined where the players are the UAVs. The potential function is the total sum rate of the users. The agents' utility in the potential game is their marginal contribution to the global welfare or their so-called wonderful life utility. A game-theoretic learning algorithm, binary log-linear learning (BLLL), is then applied to the problem. Given the potential game structure, a consequence of our utility design, the stochastically stable states using BLLL are guaranteed to be the potential maximizers. Hence, we optimally solve the joint user-UAV association and 3-D-location problem. Next, we exploit the submodular features of the sum rate function for a given configuration of UAVs to design an efficient greedy algorithm. Despite the simplicity of the greedy algorithm, it comes with a performance guarantee of 1-1/e of the optimal solution. To further reduce the number of iterations, we propose another heuristic greedy algorithm that provides very good results. Our simulations show that, in practice, the proposed greedy approaches achieve significant performance in a few iterations.	https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9392003	0
A Provenance-Aware Distributed Trust Model for Resilient Unmanned Aerial Vehicle Networks	An unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) network is an emerging industrial IoT network for collaborative UAV communication and management. The open architecture and dynamic topology, which provide functional benefits, unfortunately make UAVNs more vulnerable to a variety of attacks. In UAVNs, malicious nodes not only eavesdrop the communications between UAV nodes but also attempt to attack the entire network by injecting or modifying messages. This work proposes a provenance-aware distributed trust model, named UAV-pro, for UAVNs that aim to achieve accurate peer-to-peer trust assessment and maximize the delivery of correct messages received by destination nodes while minimizing the message delay and communication cost under resource-constrained network environments. Provenance refers to the history of ownership of messages transmitted on the network. The behavior of message creators and operators can be effectively evaluated based on message integrity, then generate the observational evidence. We collect the observational evidence for distributed trust evaluation, then identify malicious nodes in the network and isolate them from the network. UAVN-pro takes a data-driven approach to reduce resource consumption in the presence of selfish or malicious nodes while ensuring the safe transmission of data by digital signature technology. The experimental results show that UAVN-pro works are compatible with the existing UAV network routing protocols, and can effectively identify attacks, such as the black hole, gray hole, message modification, fake recommendation, and fake identity in UAV networks. UAVN-pro is superior to the existing security model in terms of detection rate, delivery rate, and system energy consumption in most cases.	https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9162060	no
Supporting IoT With Rate-Splitting Multiple Access in Satellite and Aerial-Integrated Networks	To satisfy the explosive access demands of Internet-of-Things (IoT) devices, various kinds of multiple access techniques have received much attention. In this article, we investigate the multicast communication of a satellite and aerial-integrated network (SAIN) with rate-splitting multiple access (RSMA), where both satellite and unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) components are controlled by network management center and operate in the same frequency band. Considering a content delivery scenario, the UAV subnetwork adopts the RSMA to support massive access of IoT devices (IoTDs) and achieve desired performances of interference suppression, spectral efficiency, and hardware complexity. We first formulate an optimization problem to maximize the sum rate of the considered system subject to the signal-interference-plus-noise-ratio requirements of IoTDs and per-antenna power constraints at the UAV and satellite. To solve this nonconvex optimization problem, we exploit the sequential convex approximation and the first-order Taylor expansion to convert the original optimization problem into a solvable one with the rank-one constraint, and then propose an iterative penalty function-based algorithm to solve it. Finally, simulation results verify that the proposed method can effectively suppress the mutual interference and improve the system sum rate compared to the benchmark schemes.	https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9324793	no
Multihop V2U Path Availability Analysis in UAV-Assisted Vehicular Networks	The work presented in this article aims at improving the ground vehicle connectivity in the context of an intermittent vehicle-to-UAV (V2U) communication scenario where vehicles opportunistically establish time-limited connectivity with passing by unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) serving as flying base stations responsible for routing incoming vehicle data over backbone networks and/or the Internet. As opposed to existing work in the literature where vehicles are only allowed to establish direct connectivity with in-range UAVs, this work aims at also exploiting the possible formation of vehicular clusters and, hence, the feasibility of intervehicular communications to establish multihop paths connecting source vehicles to destination UAVs. A mathematical model is presented for the purpose of capturing the nodal (i.e., vehicles and UAVs) mobility dynamics and derive an expression for the overall V2U connectivity probability as well as the overall average vehicle connection time. Extensive simulations are conducted in order to adduce the validity and accuracy of the proposed model and provide further insights into the connectivity sensibility to fundamental system parameters.	https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9312668	no
Dynamics of Laser-Charged UAVs: A Battery Perspective	In this article, we aim to sustain unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV)-based missions for longer periods of times through different techniques. First, we consider on-the-mission UAV recharging by a low-power laser source (below 1 kW). In order to achieve the maximal energy gain from the low-power laser source, we propose an operational compromise, which consists of the UAV resting over buildings with cleared line of sight to the laser source. Second, to provide a precise energy consumption/harvesting estimation at the UAV, we investigate the latter's dynamics in a mission environment. Indeed, we study the UAV's battery dynamics by leveraging the electrical models for motors and battery. Subsequently, using these models, the path planning problem in a particular Internet-of-Things-based usecase is revisited from the battery perspective. The objective is to extend the UAV's operation time using both laser-charging and accurate battery level estimation. Through a graph theory approach, the problem is solved optimally, and compared to benchmark trajectory approaches. Numerical results demonstrate the efficiency of this novel battery perspective for all path planning approaches. In contrast, we found that the energy perspective is very conservative and does not exploit optimally the available energy resources. Nevertheless, we propose a simple adjustment method to correct the energy perspective, by carefully evaluating the energy as a function of the UAV motion regimes. Finally, the impact of several parameters, such as turbulence and distance to charging source, is studied.	https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9310251	no
Secure and Efficient Honey List-Based Authentication Protocol for Vehicular Ad Hoc Networks	Vehicular Ad Hoc Network (VANET) and Internet of Vehicle (IoV) technologies are particularly attracting attention from industrial communities because of the intelligent transportation systems of smart city technologies. Vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) communication of VANET can guarantee traffic system management and road safety. However, V2V communication cannot manage many vehicles as a whole, so it needs to be segmented and communicated by region. Therefore, considering locality, key agreement is made for V2V communication of the same or different regions. Moreover, traditional public key infrastructure (PKI) and Kerberos systems to be applied in a real environment incur computational overhead. Therefore, we proposed a lightweight protocol for dynamic properties of vehicles for regional segmentation management and overhead resolution. In addition, because vehicle information is transmitted through public channels, our protocol uses mutual authentication and honey_list technology to ensure security against a variety of attacks. It provides verification of safety through a detailed security analysis using the formal analysis using the widely-accepted Real-Or-Random (ROR) model, and verifies formal security using the Automated Validation of Internet Security Protocols and Applications (AVISPA) software tool and non-mathematical (informal) security analysis. In addition, a detailed comparative study that the proposed scheme can be applied in the communication environment between actual vehicles as compared to other existing competing schemes.	https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9468344	no
Location-Based Robust Beamforming Design for Cellular-Enabled UAV Communications	Cellular communications have been regarded as promising approaches to deliver high-broadband communication links for unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), which have been widely deployed to conduct various missions, e.g., precision agriculture, forest monitoring, and border patrol. However, the unique features of aerial UAVs, including high-altitude manipulation, 3-D mobility, and rapid velocity changes, pose challenging issues to realize reliable cellular-enabled UAV communications, especially with the severe intercell interference generated by UAVs. To deal with this issue, we propose a novel position-based robust beamforming algorithm through complementarily integrating the navigation information and wireless channel information to improve the performance of cellular-enabled UAV communications. Specifically, in order to achieve the optimal beam weight vector, the navigation information of the UAV system is innovatively exploited to predict the changes of the direction-of-Arrival (DoA) angle. To fight against the high mobility of UAV operations, an optimization problem is formed by considering the tapered surface of DoA angle and solved to correct the inherent position error. Comprehensive simulation experiments are conducted and the results show that the proposed robust beamforming algorithm could achieve over 90% DoA estimation error reduction and up to 14-dB SINR gain compared with five benchmark beamforming algorithms, including linearly constrained minimum variance (LCMV), position-based beamforming, diagonal loading (DL), robust capon beamforming (RCB), and robust LCMV algorithm.	https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9214955	no
Energy-Efficient UAV-Enabled Data Collection via Wireless Charging: A Reinforcement Learning Approach	In this article, we study the application of unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) for data collection with wireless charging, which is crucial for providing seamless coverage and improving system performance in the next-generation wireless networks. To this end, we propose a reinforcement learning-based approach to plan the route of UAV to collect sensor data from sensor devices scattered in the physical environment. Specifically, the physical environment is divided into multiple grids, where one spot for UAV hovering as well as the wireless charging of UAV is located at the center of each grid. Each grid has a spot for the UAV to hover, and moreover, there is a wireless charger at the center of each grid, which can provide wireless charging to UAV when it is hovering in the grid. When the UAV lacks energy, it can be charged by the wireless charger at the spot. By taking into account the collected data amount as well as the energy consumption, we formulate the problem of data collection with UAV as a Markov decision problem, and exploit Q-learning to find the optimal policy. In particular, we design the reward function considering the energy efficiency of UAV flight and data collection, based on which Q-table is updated for guiding the route of UAV. Through extensive simulation results, we verify that our proposed reward function can achieve a better performance in terms of the average throughput, delay of data collection, as well as the energy efficiency of UAV, in comparison with the conventional capacity-based reward function.	https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9321340	no
Three-Dimensional-Map-Based Trajectory Design in UAV-Aided Wireless Localization Systems	This article considers the problem of localizing outdoor ground radio users with the help of an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) on the basis of received signal strength (RSS) measurements in an urban environment. We assume that the propagation model parameters are not known a priori, and depending on the UAV location, the UAV-user link can experience either Line-of-Sight (LoS) or Non-Line-of-Sight (NLoS) propagation condition. We assume that a 3-D map of the environment is available which the UAV can exploit in the localization process. Based on the proposed map-aided estimator, we devise an optimal UAV trajectory to accelerate the learning process under a limited mission time. To do so, we borrow tools, such as Fisher information from the theory of optimal experiment design. Our map-aided estimator achieves superior localization accuracy compared to the map-unaware methods, and our simulations show that optimized UAV trajectory achieves superior learning performance compared to random trajectories.	https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9186164	no
Malware on Internet of UAVs Detection Combining String Matching and Fourier Transformation	Advanced persistent threat (APT), with intense penetration, long duration, and high customization, has become one of the most grievous threats to cybersecurity. Furthermore, the design and development of Internet-of-Things (IoT) devices often do not focus on security, leading APT to extend to IoT, such as the Internet of emerging unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs). Whether malware with attack payload can be successfully implanted into UAVs or not is the key to APT on the Internet of UAVs. APT malware on UAVs establishes communication with the command and control (C&C) server to achieve remote control for UAVs-aware information stealing. Existing effective methods detect malware by analyzing malicious behaviors generated during C&C communication. However, APT malware usually adopts a low-traffic attack mode, a large amount of normal traffic is mixed in each attack step, to avoid virus checking and killing. Therefore, it is difficult for traditional malware detection methods to discover APT malware on UAVs that carry weak abnormal signals. Fortunately, we found that most APT attacks use domain name system (DNS) to locate C&C server of malware for information transmission periodically. This behavior will leave some records in the network flow and DNS logs, which provides us with an opportunity to identify infected internal UAVs and external malicious domain names. This article proposes an APT malware on the Internet of UAVs detection method combining string matching and Fourier transformation based on DNS traffic, which is able to handle encrypted and obfuscated traffic due to packet payloads independence. We preprocessed the collected network traffic by converting DNS timestamps of DNS request to strings and used the trained random forest model to discover APT malware domain names based on features extracted through string-matching-based periodicity detection and Fourier transformation-based periodicity detection. The proposed method has been evaluated on the data set, including part of normal domains from the normal traffic and malicious domains marked by security experts from APT malware traffic. Experimental results have shown that our proposed detection method can achieve the accuracy of 94%, which is better than the periodicity detection algorithm alone. Moreover, the proposed method does not need to set the confidence to filter the periodicity with high confidence.	https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9220767	no
Robust Learning-Enabled Intelligence for the Internet of Things: A Survey From the Perspectives of Noisy Data and Adversarial Examples	The Internet of Things (IoT) has been widely adopted in a range of verticals, e.g., automation, health, energy, and manufacturing. Many of the applications in these sectors, such as self-driving cars and remote surgery, are critical and high stakes applications, calling for advanced machine learning (ML) models for data analytics. Essentially, the training and testing data that are collected by massive IoT devices may contain noise (e.g., abnormal data, incorrect labels, and incomplete information) and adversarial examples. This requires high robustness of ML models to make reliable decisions for IoT applications. The research of robust ML has received tremendous attention from both academia and industry in recent years. This article will investigate the state of the art and representative works of robust ML models that can enable high resilience and reliability of IoT intelligence. Two aspects of robustness will be focused on, i.e., when the training data of ML models contain noises and adversarial examples, which may typically happen in many real-world IoT scenarios. In addition, the reliability of both neural networks and reinforcement learning framework will be investigated. Both of these two ML paradigms have been widely used in handling data in IoT scenarios. The potential research challenges and open issues will be discussed to provide future research directions.	https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9174633	yes
Guest Editorial: Special Issue on Internet of UAVs Over Cellular Networks	The Emerging unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) have been widely exploited for sensing purposes due to the larger service coverage compared with the conventional fixed sensor nodes. However, due to the limited computation capability of UAVs, real-time sensory data needs to be transmitted to the BS/server for real-time data processing. In this regard, the cellular networks are necessary to support the data transmission for UAVs, which is called the Internet of UAVs. Very recently, 3GPP has approved a study item on the enhanced support to seamlessly integrate UAVs into future cellular networks.	https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9447308	no
Robust 60-GHz Beamforming for UAVs: Experimental Analysis of Hovering, Blockage, and Beam Selection	Unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) mounted millimeter-wave (mmWave) base stations as well as aerial backhaul links will enable on-demand deployment of network resources. However, prior work has shown aerial links are prone to the frequent disruption caused by: 1) constant hovering due to GPS inaccuracies that impact narrow beamwidths; 2) blockages in the direct line of sight; and 3) suboptimal beam selection, especially if reduced angular sectors are searched in a highly dynamic environment. This article characterizes the impact of each of these phenomena for aerial mmWave links and proposes methods to distinctly identify when they occur in isolation or in combination during deployment. Furthermore, it also proposes corrective actions at the UAV, appropriate for the specific type(s) of impacting events: physical displacement from its earlier location, angular rotation around its vertical axis, or beamwidth adjustment. Our approach relies on exploiting the information contained in the angular domain of a large data set of experimentally collected beam-selection outcomes, under the above practical scenarios. We incorporate GPS accuracy models and antenna radiation patterns to create a robust model of potential outages. We then propose device-agnostic algorithms that jointly optimize UAVs' physical movement and the beamforming procedure. The experimental results obtained by mounting a pair of 60-GHz channel sounders on M600 DJI UAVs reveal loss reduction of up to 74.7%, translated into 260% physical layer bit-rate improvement compared to the classical 802.11ad standards-defined approach.	https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9177168	no
Toward Achieving Fine-Grained Access Control of Data in Connected and Autonomous Vehicles	A connected and autonomous vehicle (CAV) is often fitted with a large number of onboard sensors and applications to support autonomous driving functions. Based on the current research, little work on applications' access to in-vehicle data has been done. Furthermore, most existing autonomous driving operating systems lack authentication and encryption units. As such, applications can excessively obtain confidential information, such as vehicle location and owner preferences and even upload it to the cloud, threatening the security of the vehicle and the privacy of the owner. In this study, we propose a fine-grained access control scheme to restrict applications' access to data in CAVs (FGAC-inCAVs). First, we present a system model composed of the following elements: a trusted third party (TTP), which is a fully trusted authority; perception components like sensors, which can capture the road information (pictures, videos, etc.); and multiple applications. Then, a fast attribute-based encryption (ABE) is presented, and security analysis also shows it is secure against selective and chosen-plaintext attacks. Furthermore, we propose a key update scheme based on the Chinese remainder theorem (CRT). Finally, the theoretical analysis and simulation experiments demonstrate its feasibility and efficiency.	https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9277522	no
Adaptive Square Attack: Fooling Autonomous Cars With Adversarial Traffic Signs	To better understand the road condition and make correct driving decisions, traffic sign recognition becomes a crucial component commonly equipped in the vision system of modern autonomous cars. The state-of-the-art traffic sign recognition models are designed with the backbones of deep neural networks (DNNs) since DNNs are powerful to extract more effective visual features that benefit recognition performance. As the recent studies on adversarial attacks have shown that DNNs are easy to be fooled by perturbed images and lead to misclassification, in this article, we explore the vulnerability of the DNN-based traffic sign recognition model. Most existing adversarial attack methods limitedly focus on the white-box attack on the recognition models whose underlying configurations (e.g., network architectures and parameters) are accessible. Differently, we propose a novel attacking method dubbed adaptive square attack (ASA) that can accomplish the black-box attack, i.e., bypassing the access the configurations of the recognition models. Specifically, the proposed ASA method employs an efficient sampling strategy that can generate perturbations for traffic sign images with fewer query times. Extensive experiments on the benchmark data set German traffic sign recognition benchmark with large-scale traffic sign images for autonomous cars show that our proposed ASA method is advanced to perform the black-box attack with high efficiency. Although the generated adversarial traffic sign images by the proposed ASA method are visually similar to the raw images with almost imperceptible differences, they can successfully lead to the misclassification of the state-of-the-art recognition model.	https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9165820	yes
Coverage Guided Differential Adversarial Testing of Deep Learning Systems	Deep learning is increasingly applied to safety-critical application domains such as autonomous cars and medical devices. It is of significant importance to ensure their reliability and robustness. In this paper, we propose DLFuzz, the coverage guided differential adversarial testing framework to guide deep learing systems exposing incorrect behaviors. DLFuzz keeps minutely mutating the input to maximize the neuron coverage and the prediction difference between the original input and the mutated input, without manual labeling effort or cross-referencing oracles from other systems with the same functionality. We also design multiple novel strategies for neuron selection to improve the neuron coverage. The incorrect behaviors obtained by DLFuzz are then exploited for retraining and improving the dependability of the models. We present empirical evaluations on two well-known data-sets to demonstrate its effectiveness. Compared with DeepXplore, the state-of-the-art deep learning white-box testing framework, DLFuzz does not require extra efforts to find similar functional deep learning systems for cross-referencing check. But DLFuzz could generate $338.59\%$ more adversarial inputs with $89.82\%$ smaller perturbations, while maintaining the identities of the original inputs. DLFuzz also managed to averagely obtain $2.86\%$ higher neuron coverage, and save $20.11\%$ time consumption with respect to DeepXplore. We then evaluate the effectiveness of strategies for neuron selection, and demonstrated that all these strategies perform better than DeepXplore. Finally, DLFuzz proved to be able to improve the accuracy of deep learning systems by incorporating these adversarial inputs to retrain.	https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9099600	yes
Learning in the Air: Secure Federated Learning for UAV-Assisted Crowdsensing	Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) combined with artificial intelligence (AI) have opened a revolutionized way for mobile crowdsensing (MCS). Conventional AI models, built on aggregation of UAVs' sensing data (typically contain private and sensitive user information), may arise severe privacy and data misuse concerns. Federated learning, as a promising distributed AI paradigm, has opened up possibilities for UAVs to collaboratively train a shared global model without revealing their local sensing data. However, there still exist potential security and privacy threats for UAV-assisted crowdsensing with federated learning due to vulnerability of central curator, unreliable contribution recording, and low-quality shared local models. In this paper, we propose SFAC, a secure federated learning framework for UAV-assisted MCS. Specifically, we first introduce a blockchain-based collaborative learning architecture for UAVs to securely exchange local model updates and verify contributions without the central curator. Then, by applying local differential privacy, we design a privacy-preserving algorithm to protect UAVs' privacy of updated local models with desirable learning accuracy. Furthermore, a two-tier reinforcement learning-based incentive mechanism is exploited to promote UAVs' high-quality model sharing when explicit knowledge of network parameters are not available in practice. Extensive simulations are conducted, and the results demonstrate that the proposed SFAC can effectively improve utilities for UAVs, promote high-quality model sharing, and ensure privacy protection in federated learning, compared with existing schemes.	https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9159929	no
Joint UAV Position and Power Optimization for Accurate Regional Localization in Space-Air Integrated Localization Network	Accurate location estimation of Internet-of-Things (IoT) devices within an Area of Interest (AoI) is a challenging issue, especially in a global navigation satellite system (GNSS)-constrained environment. In this article, we present a space-air integrated localization network (SAILN) architecture to exploit the advantages of the unmanned-aerial-vehicle (UAV)-based localization through joint position and power optimization (JPPO) strategies. In SAILN, UAVs can utilize their flexible movement to obtain the line-of-sight (LOS) path with a high probability, thereby providing the potential IoT devices in the AoI with supplementary localization information. The JPPO of UAVs aims to improve the regional localization accuracy for the entire AoI, considering the no-fly-zone (NFZ) and the total energy constraint. We propose the average localization accuracy increment (ALAI) of the sampling points in the AoI as the metric to measure the performance of SAILN compared with that of only satellites, which is regarded as the objective to formulate the JPPO problems for UAV operations in both static and dynamic SAILN. The intractable problems can be resolved by the pure genetic algorithm (PGA) that has a low computational cost and unique features suiting the JPPO of UAVs. Then, by taking advantage of the ALAI convexity to the UAVs' power, we propose a power reallocation-based two-step algorithm (PRTSA) to further explore an improved JPPO solution. Simulation results validate that the proposed PRTSA can obtain a higher localization accuracy for the entire AoI than the PGA and the other straightforward baselines.	https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9220776	no
A Machine-Learning-Based Data-Centric Misbehavior Detection Model for Internet of Vehicles	The Internet of Things (IoT) boosts road safety, efficiency, and infotainment by connecting vehicles to form the Internet of Vehicles (IoV). Specifically to safety, IoV complements autonomous cars beyond sensors' line-of-sight, facilitating vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) communications in a smart transportation environment. The correctness of data exchanged among vehicles is paramount to ensure vehicles behave as per norms. Traditional misbehavior detection methods hardly defend vehicular security effectively due to rapid dynamics and location privacy. In particular, those node-centric classifiers become ill-fit in IoV. This work proposes a data-centric misbehavior detection model based on supervised machine learning (ML). The work also integrates plausibility checks with ML techniques and instantiates the model with six algorithms to demonstrate their comparative effectiveness. In addition to misbehavior detection, the model classifies attack types to support validating countermeasures. Specifically, the work analyzes the supervised learning algorithms for detecting misbehavior in IoV, compares their performance, and identifies their limitations. VeReMi, a vehicle-to-everything (V2X) position forgery attack built-in simulated road traffic data set, is used to test the effectiveness of the proposed model. The performance metrics include precision-recall (PR) and receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves. The results demonstrate the effectiveness and significance of ML to detect misbehavior in IoV. The addition of plausibility checks improves the precision and recall by 5% and 2%, respectively.	https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9245568	yes
Targeted Attention Attack on Deep Learning Models in Road Sign Recognition	Real-world traffic sign recognition is an important step toward building autonomous vehicles, most of which highly dependent on deep neural networks (DNNs). Recent studies demonstrated that DNNs are surprisingly susceptible to adversarial examples. Many attack methods have been proposed to understand and generate adversarial examples, such as gradient-based attack, score-based attack, decision-based attack, and transfer-based attacks. However, most of these algorithms are ineffective in real-world road sign attack, because 1) iteratively learning perturbations for each frame is not realistic for a fast moving car and 2) most optimization algorithms traverse all pixels equally without considering their diverse contribution. To alleviate these problems, this article proposes the targeted attention attack (TAA) method for real-world road sign attack. Specifically, we have made the following contributions: 1) we leverage the soft attention map to highlight those important pixels and skip those zero-contributed areas-this also helps to generate natural perturbations; 2) we design an efficient universal attack that optimizes a single perturbation/noise based on a set of training images under the guidance of the pretrained attention map; 3) we design a simple objective function that can be easily optimized; and 4) we evaluate the effectiveness of TAA on real-world data sets. Experimental results validate that the TAA method improves the attack successful rate (nearly 10%) and reduces the perturbation loss (about a quarter) compared with the popular RP2 method. Additionally, our TAA also provides good properties, e.g., transferability and generalization capability. We provide code and data to ensure the reproducibility: https://github.com/AdvAttack/RoadSignAttack.	https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9245511	yes
Full-Duplex UAV Relaying for Multiple User Pairs	Based on the advantages of small size, lightweight, as well as flexible deployment and recycling, unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) has been more and more widely used in military and civilian. As flying relays, UAVs can quickly set up relay communication links for different missions, to enhance the receiving signal power, increase the system capacity, and expand the communication coverage. In this article, we investigate full-duplex (FD) UAV relaying for multiple source-destination pairs. To fully exploit the flying flexibility of the UAV in serving multiple source-destination pairs, we propose a scheduling protocol that exploits time-division multiple access (TDMA) to serve different source-destination pairs in turns when flying along an optimized trajectory. Then, we further formulate a joint optimization problem of the TDMA-based user scheduling, the dynamic UAV trajectory, and the UAV transmit power to maximize the system throughput. The formulated problem is nonconvex that makes it difficult to solve directly, hence we propose an iterative algorithm to obtain an approximate optimal solution based on block coordinate descent and successive convex optimization techniques. Simulation results demonstrate that our proposed FD-based UAV relaying network achieves significant throughput gains compared with the half-duplex (HD) baseline, and the TDMA-based protocol outperforms the OFDMA-based ones with fixed UAV position/trajectory when the UAV helps relay information for multiple source-destination pairs.	https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9209050	no
IoT-Ready Energy-Autonomous Parking Sensor Device	Finding a free parking lot contributes largely to a total traffic congestion and increases gas emissions in urban and overpopulated cities. Recent advances in smart parking systems adopt Internet of Things (IoT) concepts which tend to improve traffic bottlenecks by providing information about available parking lots. The detection of vehicle presence at the parking lot usually means adopting solutions comprised of power-hungry and battery-operated sensor devices. In this article a hardware-based approach is introduced which aims at building a self-powered and autonomous sensing node equipped with supercapacitors (battery less) to feel the vehicle presence. For purposes of detection, solar-based energy harvester and wake-up trigger prototype is considered along with a Bluetooth low-energy (BLE) radio. The joint use of such technologies is exploited to develop a power autonomous node capable of cost-effectively sensing the car presence and transmitting the parking lot status. The developed triggering system consumes only 150 nA making it suitable as a low-power solution. To initiate the trigger only 6.5 W/m2 in light level change is required comparing the two panels, which is more than adequate as the comparison of solar irradiance measured under the vehicle against diffuse horizontal irradiance shows a significant difference. The developed prototype uses a magnetometer to verify the vehicle presence upon trigger generation and BLE 5.0 technology for status change update, while supercapacitor discharge lifetime duration is estimated to be around 13 days in harsh conditions without charging from solar cells.	https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9223726	no
Edge Learning With Unmanned Ground Vehicle: Joint Path, Energy, and Sample Size Planning	Edge learning (EL), which uses edge computing as a platform to execute machine learning algorithms, is able to fully exploit the massive sensing data generated by Internet of Things (IoT). However, due to the limited transmit power at IoT devices, collecting the sensing data in EL systems is a challenging task. To address this challenge, this article proposes to integrate unmanned ground vehicle (UGV) with EL. With such a scheme, the UGV could improve the communication quality by approaching various IoT devices. However, different devices may transmit different data for different machine learning jobs and a fundamental question is how to jointly plan the UGV path, the devices’ energy consumption, and the number of samples for different jobs? This article further proposes a graph-based path planning model, a network energy consumption model, and a sample size planning model that characterizes F-measure as a function of the minority class sample size. With these models, the joint path, energy and sample size planning (JPESP) problem is formulated as a large-scale mixed-integer nonlinear programming (MINLP) problem, which is nontrivial to solve due to the high-dimensional discontinuous variables related to UGV movement. To this end, it is proved that each IoT device should be served only once along the path, thus the problem dimension is significantly reduced. Furthermore, to handle the discontinuous variables, a tabu search (TS)-based algorithm is derived, which converges in expectation to the optimal solution to the JPESP problem. Simulation results under different task scenarios show that our optimization schemes outperform the fixed EL and the full path EL schemes.	https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9189854	no
Dynamic Aerial Base Station Placement for Minimum-Delay Communications	Queuing delay is of essential importance in the Internet-of-Things scenarios where the buffer sizes of devices are limited. The existing cross-layer research contributions aiming at minimizing the queuing delay usually rely on either transmit power control or dynamic spectrum allocation. Bearing in mind that the transmission throughput is dependent on the distance between the transmitter and the receiver, in this context we exploit the agility of the unmanned-aerial-vehicle (UAV)-mounted base stations (BSs) for proactively adjusting the aerial BS (ABS)’s placement in accordance with wireless teletraffic dynamics. Specifically, we formulate a minimum-delay ABS placement problem for UAV-enabled networks, subject to realistic constraints on the ABS’s battery life and velocity. Its solutions are technically realized under three different assumptions in regard to the wireless teletraffic dynamics. The backward induction technique is invoked for both the scenario where the full knowledge of the wireless teletraffic dynamics is available, and for the case where only their statistical knowledge is available. In contrast, a reinforcement learning aided approach is invoked for the case when neither the exact number of arriving packets nor that of their statistical knowledge is available. The numerical results demonstrate that our proposed algorithms are capable of improving the system’s performance compared to the benchmark schemes in terms of both the average delay and of the buffer overflow probability.	https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9154460	no
AC4AV: A Flexible and Dynamic Access Control Framework for Connected and Autonomous Vehicles	Sensing data plays a pivotal role in connected and autonomous vehicles (CAVs), enabling CAV to perceive surroundings. For example, malicious applications might tamper this life-critical data, resulting in erroneous driving decisions and threatening the safety of passengers. Access control, one of the promising solutions to protect data from unauthorized access, is urgently needed for vehicle sensing data. However, due to the intrinsic complexity of vehicle sensing data, including historical and real time, and access patterns of different data sources, there is currently no suitable access control framework that can systematically solve this problem; current frameworks only focus on one aspect. In this article, we propose a novel and flexible access control framework, AC4AV, which aims to support various access control models, and provide APIs for dynamically adjusting access control models and developing customized access control models, thus supporting access control research on CAV for the community. In addition, we propose a data abstraction method to clearly identify data, applications, and access operations in CAV, and therefore is easily able to configure the permits of each data and application in access control policies. We have implemented a prototype to demonstrate our architecture on NATS for real-time data and NGINX for historical data, and three access control models as built-in models. We measured the performance of our AC4AV while applying these access control models to real-time and historical data. The experimental results show that the framework has little impact on real-time data access within a tolerable range.	https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9169695	no
Modeling Data Redundancy and Cost-Aware Task Allocation in MEC-Enabled Internet-of-Vehicles Applications	Multiaccess edge computing (MEC) enables autonomous vehicles to handle time-critical and data-intensive computational tasks for emerging Internet-of-Vehicles (IoV) applications via computation offloading. However, a massive amount of data generated by colocated vehicles is typically redundant, introducing a critical issue due to limited network bandwidth. Moreover, on the edge server side, these computation-intensive tasks further impose severe pressure on the resource-finite MEC server, resulting in low-performance efficiency of applications. To solve these challenges, we model the data redundancy and collaborative task computing scheme to efficiently reduce the redundant data and utilize the idle resources in nearby MEC servers. First, the data redundancy problem is formulated as a set-covering problem according to the spatiotemporal coverage of captured images. Next, we exploit the submodular optimization technique to design an efficient algorithm to minimize the number of images transferred to the MEC servers without degrading the quality of IoV applications. To facilitate the task execution in the MEC server, we then propose a collaborative task computing scheme, where an MEC server intentionally encourages nearby resource-rich MEC servers to participate in a collaborative computing group. Accordingly, a cost model is formulated as an optimization problem, the objective of which is to prompt the MEC server to judiciously allocate computing tasks to nearby MEC servers with the goal of achieving the minimal cost while the latency of tasks is guaranteed. Experimental results show that the proposed scheme can efficiently mitigate data redundancy, conserve network bandwidth consumption, and achieve the lowest cost for processing tasks.	https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9163316	no
Ad Hoc Vehicular Fog Enabling Cooperative Low-Latency Intrusion Detection	Internet of Vehicles and vehicular networks have been compelling targets for malicious security attacks where several intrusion detection solutions have been proposed for protecting them. Nonetheless, their main problem lies in their heavy computation, which makes them unsuitable for next-generation artificial intelligence-powered self-driving vehicles whose computational power needs to be primarily reserved for real-time driving decisions. To address this challenge, several approaches have been lately presented to take advantage of the cloud computing for offloading intrusion detection tasks to central cloud servers, thus reducing storage and processing costs on vehicles. However, centralized cloud computing entails high latency on intrusion detection related data transmission and plays against its adoption in delay-critical intelligent applications. In this context, this article proposes a vehicular-edge computing (VEC) fog-enabled scheme allowing offloading intrusion detection tasks to federated vehicle nodes located within nearby formed ad hoc vehicular fog to be cooperatively executed with minimal latency. The problem has been formulated as a multiobjective optimization model and solved using a genetic algorithm maximizing offloading survivability in the presence of high mobility and minimizing computation execution time and energy consumption. Experiments performed on resource-constrained devices within actual ad hoc fog environment illustrate that our solution significantly reduces the execution time of the detection process while maximizing the offloading survivability under different real-life scenarios.	https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9138386	no
Anomaly Monitoring Framework in Lane Detection With a Generative Adversarial Network	The safety of an automated vehicle requires accurate information of surrounding conditions, because a false sensor output can lead to a fatal accident during driving. Thus, monitoring of abnormalities in every sensor is important for robust perception of the environment. Since it is difficult to obtain anomalous data, it is hard to develop a robust detection algorithm using only a relatively small number of anomalies. In this paper, we propose a data augmentation method for oversampling minority anomalies in lane detection. Using a generative adversarial network that makes the generator learn to estimate the distribution of anomalous data, it generates synthesized minority anomalies. The generated anomalies are used to train an anomaly detection network while minimizing latency for use in real situations. During training, the generated anomalies, with various mixed quality, are sampled differently according to their quality. This helps the detection network to be optimized with better quality data. Experimental result shows that when using the proposed anomaly detection framework for monitoring lane abnormality, it improves the performance by 12% when compared to the vanilla recurrent neural network.	https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9005205	yes
Using Eye Gaze to Enhance Generalization of Imitation Networks to Unseen Environments	Vision-based autonomous driving through imitation learning mimics the behavior of human drivers by mapping driver view images to driving actions. This article shows that performance can be enhanced via the use of eye gaze. Previous research has shown that observing an expert's gaze patterns can be beneficial for novice human learners. We show here that neural networks can also benefit. We trained a conditional generative adversarial network to estimate human gaze maps accurately from driver-view images. We describe two approaches to integrating gaze information into imitation networks: eye gaze as an additional input and gaze modulated dropout. Both significantly enhance generalization to unseen environments in comparison with a baseline vanilla network without gaze, but gaze-modulated dropout performs better. We evaluated performance quantitatively on both single images and in closed-loop tests, showing that gaze modulated dropout yields the lowest prediction error, the highest success rate in overtaking cars, the longest distance between infractions, lowest epistemic uncertainty, and improved data efficiency. Using Grad-CAM, we show that gaze modulated dropout enables the network to concentrate on task-relevant areas of the image.	https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9104858	no
Efficient Resource Allocation for Multi-UAV Communication Against Adjacent and Co-Channel Interference	Unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) swarm has emerged as a promising novel paradigm to achieve better coverage and higher capacity for future wireless network by exploiting the more favorable line-of-sight (LoS) propagation. To reap the potential gains of UAV swarm, the remote control signal sent by ground control unit (GCU) is essential, whereas the control signal quality are susceptible in practice due to the effect of the adjacent channel interference (ACI) and the external interference (EI) from radiation sources distributed across the region. To tackle these challenges, this paper considers priority-aware resource coordination in a multi-UAV communication system, where multiple UAVs are controlled by a GCU to perform certain tasks with a pre-defined trajectory. Specifically, we maximize the minimum signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR) among all the UAVs by jointly optimizing channel assignment and power allocation strategy under stringent resource availability constraints. According to the intensity of ACI, we consider the corresponding problem in two scenarios, i.e., Null-ACI and ACI systems. By virtue of the particular problem structure in Null-ACI case, we first recast the formulation into an equivalent yet more tractable form and obtain the global optimal solution via Hungarian algorithm. For general ACI systems, we develop an efficient iterative algorithm for its solution based on the alternating optimization methods. Extensive simulation results demonstrate that the proposed algorithms can significantly enhance the minimum SINR among all the UAVs and adapt the allocation of communication resources to diverse mission priority.	https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9512435	no
Robust Orientation-Sensitive Trajectory Tracking of Underactuated Autonomous Underwater Vehicles	Orientation-sensitive trajectory tracking (OSTT) claims that both position and orientation of the autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs) are regulated to the reference. This article addresses the OSTT controller design problem for AUVs with separate forces or torques for surge, heave, roll, and yaw, in the presence of hydrodynamic uncertainties and external disturbances. In the kinematic stage, these AUVs are capable of moving sideways by exploiting the nonzero angle of the roll, so that the position tracking can be handled while the steering tracks the referenced yaw angle. As for the kinetic stage, a robust nonsmooth controller is implemented to guarantee the exponential convergence of velocity tracking errors. Trajectories are planned for the docking task and bridge pier inspection task. It is shown that the position tracking error can converge to a neighborhood about zero, and the yaw angle tracking error converges to zero exponentially as well. The effectiveness of the proposed method is illustrated by both simulation results and experimental results.	https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9162488	maybe
String Stability of a Vehicular Platoon With the Use of Macroscopic Information	The paper investigates the possibility of using macroscopic information to improve control performance of a vehicular platoon composed of autonomous vehicles.

Examples of mesoscopic control laws are illustrated and simulations show the effectiveness of our approach in ensuring String Stability and improving the platoon behavior.	https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9352242	no
A Homography-Based Dynamic Control Approach Applied to Station Keeping of Autonomous Underwater Vehicles Without Linear Velocity Measurements	A homography-based dynamic control approach applied to station keeping of autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs) without relying on linear velocity measurements is proposed. The homography estimated from images of a planar target scene captured by a downward-looking camera is directly used as feedback information. The full dynamics of the AUV are exploited in a hierarchical control design with inner and outer loop architectures. Enhanced by integral compensation actions and disturbance torque estimation, the proposed controller is robust with respect to model uncertainties and unknown currents. The performance of the proposed control approach is illustrated using both comparative simulation results conducted on a realistic AUV model and experimental validations on an in-house AUV.	https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9235541	no
Space Pruning Based Time Minimization in Delay Constrained Multi-Task UAV-Based Sensing	Due to the inherent mobility and enhanced communication capability of the unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV), it is foreseen that effective UAV-based sensing schemes can achieve faster deployment and flexible observation as compared to the traditional fixed sensing systems. In many sensing applications, multiple geographically distributed tasks need to be executed while satisfying a stringent requirement on the transmission delay of the sensory data, especially for the time-critical sensing tasks, such as disaster rescue and environment monitoring. To minimize the overall mission completion time in such delay constrained multi-task UAV-based sensing applications, it is imperative to properly design the inter-task trajectory, the UAV-BS association, and the sensing order. Nonetheless, finding the optimal sensing scheme is highly non-trivial since these three sub-problems are tightly coupled and involve non-convex constraints. To overcome these challenges, firstly, a novel space pruning based trajectory search (SPTS) algorithm is proposed by exploiting the geometric characteristics of the optimal inter-task UAV trajectory, which can achieve a substantially faster convergence as compared to the Ployblock algorithm. Secondly, a novel optimal UAV-BS association (OUBA) algorithm is presented to quickly identify the best BS for each sensing task. Thirdly, by combining these two proposed algorithms with the Lin-Kernighan-Helsgaun (LKH) algorithm, a lower bound of the mission completion time can be efficiently computed and a near-optimal solution can be obtained. Numerical simulations demonstrate that significant performance improvement can be achieved by the proposed scheme.	https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9361388	no
UAV-Assisted Data Collection With Nonorthogonal Multiple Access	Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) facilitate information collection greatly in the Internet-of-Things (IoT) systems due to their superior flexibility and mobility. On the other hand, nonorthogonal multiple access (NOMA) is regarded as a promising technology to provide high spectral efficiency and support massive connectivity in fifth-generation networks. The integration of NOMA into UAV-assisted wireless networks shows great potential, but how to determine the user grouping and power allocation in NOMA according to the high mobility of UAV is challenging. In this article, we propose a general NOMA-enabled UAV-assisted data collection (NUDC) protocol to maximize the sum rate of a wireless sensor network (WSN), where the location of UAV, sensor grouping, and power control are jointly considered. Moreover, a joint signal-to-interference ratio (SIR) hypergraph-based grouping and power control (SHG-PC) NOMA scheme is provided to obtain the appropriate sensor grouping and the optimal power control solutions efficiently, in which the hypergraph and the greedy coloring algorithm are exploited to find out the optimized group relationships. Extensive simulation results demonstrate the efficiency of our proposed protocol.	https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9126800	no
On the Design of Mutual Authentication and Key Agreement Protocol in Internet of Vehicles-Enabled Intelligent Transportation System	Internet of Vehicles (IoV), a distributed network involving connected vehicles and Vehicular Ad Hoc Networks (VANETs), allows connected vehicles to communicate with other Internet-connected entities in real time. The communications among these entities (e.g. vehicles, pedestrians, fleet management systems, and road-side infrastructure) generally take place via an open channel. In other words, such an open communication can be targeted by the adversary to eavesdrop, modify, insert fabricated (or malicious) messages, or delete any data-in-transit; thus, resulting in replay, impersonation, man-in-the-middle, privileged-insider, and other related attacks. In addition to security, anonymity and untraceability are two other important features that should be achieved in an authentication protocol. In this paper, we propose a new mutual authentication and key agreement protocol in an IoV-enabled Intelligent Transportation System (ITS). Using both formal and informal security analysis, as well as formal security verification using an automated verification tool, we show that the proposed scheme is secure against several known attacks in an IoV-enabled ITS environment. Furthermore, a detailed comparative analysis shows that the proposed scheme has low communication and computational overheads, and offers better security and functionality attributes in comparison to seven other competing schemes. We also evaluate the performance of the proposed scheme using NS2.	https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9319539	no
Anomaly Detection for Cooperative Adaptive Cruise Control in Autonomous Vehicles Using Statistical Learning and Kinematic Model	This paper focuses on Cooperative Adaptive Cruise Control (CACC) in autonomous vehicles. In CACC, vehicles regulate their speed according to a preceding “leader” vehicle in the lane, forming a platoon. In a benign environment, CACC reduces fuel consumption, maximizes road capacity, and ensures traffic safety. However, CACC is vulnerable to various security threats. In this paper, we consider one of the critical threats, where the platoon leader is compromised, and forges acceleration information sent to platoon members. Such attack would lead to traffic instability and potential collisions. First, we propose information sharing in CACC model to allow vehicles and fixed infrastructure to sense and share information about platoon leaders, hence improves the reliability and supports the detection of anomalous behavior. Then, we propose a real-time anomaly detection mechanism that combines statistical learning with the physics laws of kinematics. Specifically, we propose Generalized Extreme Studentized Deviate with Sliding Chunks (GESD-SC) approach, which is applied at each vehicle in the platoon to detect anomalies in real-time based on the vehicle's own speeding decisions. Kinematic model is also utilized to detect unexpected deviations using the leader's information, communicated directly and observed by the leader's neighboring vehicle(s) and/or supporting infrastructure. Combining kinematic model with GESD-SC has shown to be effective in detecting falsification attacks in CACC. Furthermore, we analyze the time performance, and show that the proposed technique outperforms existing method in detection accuracy and processing time.	https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9061150	maybe
State Estimation for HALE UAVs With Deep-Learning-Aided Virtual AOA/SSA Sensors for Analytical Redundancy	High-altitudelong-endurance (HALE) unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) are employed in a variety of fields because of their ability to fly for a long time at high altitudes, even in the stratosphere. Two paramount concerns exist: enhancing their safety during long-term flight and reducing their weight as much as possible to increase their energy efficiency based on analytical redundancy approaches. In this letter, a novel deep-learning-aided navigation filter is proposed, which consists of two parts: an end-to-end mapping-based synthetic sensor measurement model that utilizes long short-term memory (LSTM) networks to estimate the angle of attack (AOA) and sideslip angle (SSA) and an unscented Kalman filter for state estimation. Our proposed method can not only reduce the weight of HALE UAVs but also ensure their safety by means of an analytical redundancy approach. In contrast to conventional approaches, our LSTM-based method achieves better estimation by virtue of its nonlinear mapping capability.	https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9408352	no
Deep Multi-Modal Object Detection and Semantic Segmentation for Autonomous Driving: Datasets, Methods, and Challenges	Recent advancements in perception for autonomous driving are driven by deep learning. In order to achieve robust and accurate scene understanding, autonomous vehicles are usually equipped with different sensors (e.g. cameras, LiDARs, Radars), and multiple sensing modalities can be fused to exploit their complementary properties. In this context, many methods have been proposed for deep multi-modal perception problems. However, there is no general guideline for network architecture design, and questions of “what to fuse”, “when to fuse”, and “how to fuse” remain open. This review paper attempts to systematically summarize methodologies and discuss challenges for deep multi-modal object detection and semantic segmentation in autonomous driving. To this end, we first provide an overview of on-board sensors on test vehicles, open datasets, and background information for object detection and semantic segmentation in autonomous driving research. We then summarize the fusion methodologies and discuss challenges and open questions. In the appendix, we provide tables that summarize topics and methods. We also provide an interactive online platform to navigate each reference: https://boschresearch.github.io/multimodalperception/.	https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9000872	no
Blockchain-Based Key Management for Heterogeneous Flying Ad Hoc Network	Unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) is recognized as one of the best sensing tools for gathering data in the industrial Internet of things sector. Besides, the flying ad hoc network (FANET) with multiple drones shows significant advantages in complicated task performing of large area. However, as an important part of communication security, key management for FANET currently depends heavily on the base station or infrastructures, which may easily become the attack target or increase the communication overheads of drones. Therefore, we propose a blockchain-based distributed key management scheme for heterogeneous FANET in this article, based on which drones can autonomously distribute cluster keys, update their public/private key pairs, migrate between clusters, and revoke malicious UAVs in a secure way. Security analysis and performance evaluation prove that our scheme can resist against a variety of external and internal attacks, and guarantee lightweight energy consumption for ordinary drones in the network.	https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9311800	no
Moving Object Segmentation in 3D LiDAR Data: A Learning-Based Approach Exploiting Sequential Data	The ability to detect and segment moving objects in a scene is essential for building consistent maps, making future state predictions, avoiding collisions, and planning. In this letter, we address the problem of moving object segmentation from 3D LiDAR scans. We propose a novel approach that pushes the current state of the art in LiDAR-only moving object segmentation forward to provide relevant information for autonomous robots and other vehicles. Instead of segmenting the point cloud semantically, i.e., predicting the semantic classes such as vehicles, pedestrians, roads, etc., our approach accurately segments the scene into moving and static objects, i.e., also distinguishing between moving cars vs. parked cars. Our proposed approach exploits sequential range images from a rotating 3D LiDAR sensor as an intermediate representation combined with a convolutional neural network and runs faster than the frame rate of the sensor. We compare our approach to several other state-of-the-art methods showing superior segmentation quality in urban environments. Additionally, we created a new benchmark for LiDAR-based moving object segmentation based on SemanticKITTI. We published it to allow other researchers to compare their approaches transparently and we furthermore published our code.	https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9468982	no

The focus is on maximizing the secrecy energy efficiency by jointly optimizing the uplink transmission powers of the ground users and the position of the UAV. The joint optimization problem is nonconvex; therefore we split it into two subproblems and solve them using an iterative algorithm.	https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9511246	no
ADGAN: Protect Your Location Privacy in Camera Data of Auto-Driving Vehicles	Computer vision and deep neural networks have been significantly promoting the development of visual perception in these years. Particularly, for autonomous vehicles, real-time image/video data is captured by onboard cameras and analyzed by computer vision techniques in many real applications. In the captured camera data, some contents can be used as auxiliary information to infer individuals' locations and trajectories, which leads to severe privacy leakage but has been rarely studied. Thus, the goal of this article is to protect individuals' location privacy by hiding side-channel information in the captured data while preserving the data utility for downstream applications. To this end, the technology of generative adversarial networks (GAN) is utilized to design two novel models, named ADGAN-I and ADGAN-II, both of which can take the original camera data as inputs and generate privacy-preserving outputs according to predefined sensitive object class. Thus, the processed camera data can defend location inference attack from adversaries in offline applications. Moreover, in ADGAN-I and ADGAN-II, the tradeoff between location privacy and data utility can be effectively balanced. Finally, the results of extensive real-data experiments validate the superiority of our proposed models over the state of the arts in utility preservation and privacy protection for autonomous vehicles' images and videos.	https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9234081	maybe
A Minimally Supervised Approach Based on Variational Autoencoders for Anomaly Detection in Autonomous Robots	Detection of anomalies and faults is a crucial ability for fully autonomous robots. This letter proposes a new deep learning-based minimally supervised method for detecting anomalies in autonomous robots. We contribute a new Variational Auto-Encoder architecture able to model very long multivariate sensor logs exploiting a new incremental training method, which induces a progress-based latent space that can be used to detect anomalies both at runtime and offline. While most existing approaches are trained in a semi-supervised fashion and require big batches of nominal observations, our method is trained using unlabeled observations of a robot performing a task, containing both nominal and anomalous executions. Only a very little amount (even just one) of labeled nominal executions is then required to partition the learned latent space into nominal and anomalous regions. Experimental results show that our method outperforms state-of-the-art anomaly detectors commonly used in robotics both in terms of false positive rate and alert delay.	https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9364363	yes
Autonomous Shuttle-as-a-Service (ASaaS): Challenges, Opportunities, and Social Implications	Providing mobility services effectively to residents and visitors is a complex socio-technical system task to city public managers. Smart mobility systems aim to support the efficient exploitation of city transport facilities and sustainable mobility within the urban environment. People need to travel quickly and conveniently between locations at different scales, ranging from a few blocks within a city to a journey across cities. At the same time, goods need to be timely delivered, considering both the users and the businesses' needs. Several cities indicated an interest in using Autonomous Vehicles (AV) for the “last-mile” mobility services in the last few years. With them, it seems to be easier to get people and goods around using fewer vehicles. In this context, Autonomous Shuttles (AS) are beginning to be thought of as a new mobility/delivery service into the city center where narrow streets are not easily served by traditional buses. They allow them to perform critical areas with minimal new infrastructure and reduce noise and pollution. The article analyses the state-of-art on autonomous shuttles by proposing four application scenarios targeting the last-mile delivery of goods, the tourist experiences, and the shared and integrated mobility. Furthermore, we contribute with the proposition of the Autonomous Shuttles-as-a service (ASaaS) concept as the key pillar for the realization of innovative and sustainable proximity mobility. Our research proposed new research challenges for ASaaS, and we discuss social implications and governance challenges that consider user engagement and sustainability. It also recommended extending new research to focus on simulation and machine learning techniques for last-mile mobility planning and explore the journeys tracking certification via artificial intelligence and blockchain-based techniques.	https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9210552	no
Provably Safe and Scalable Multivehicle Trajectory Planning	The Hamilton–Jacobi (HJ) reachability is a promising tool for guaranteeing goal satisfaction and safety for multivehicle systems. However, a direct application of HJ reachability in most cases becomes intractable due to its exponentially scaling computational complexity with respect to the number of vehicles. In the work by Chen et al. (2018), the sequential trajectory planning (STP) method was proposed, which allows safe, multiple-vehicle trajectory planning to be done with a computation complexity that scales linearly with the number of vehicles. However, the STP computation is still not tractable for large-scale systems using the currently available tools. In this work, we introduce BEACLS, a C++-based reachability toolbox, that can leverage GPU parallelization to improve the computation speed of HJ reachability by nearly 100 times compared with the existing MATLAB implementations. We then combine BEACLS with STP for the safe, large-scale multiple-unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) planning in a city environment and a multicity environment. We show that intuitive multilane structures naturally emerge, and the size of disturbances and the vehicle density are the primary factors determining the number and width of lanes. We also extend the STP method to safely account for an adversarial intruder during trajectory planning. In the proposed formulation, the number of vehicles that need to replan is a design parameter that can be chosen based on the computational resources available during run time. The proposed formulation along with BEACLS provides both an algorithm and an efficient computational tool for resilient, large-scale multiple-vehicle trajectory planning.	https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9310283	no
CANMatch: A Fully Automated Tool for CAN Bus Reverse Engineering Based on Frame Matching	Controller Area Network is the most frequently used in-vehicle communication system in the automotive industry today. The communication inside the Controller Area Network (CAN) bus is typically encoded using proprietary formats in order to prevent easy access to the information exchanged on the bus. However, it is still possible to decode this information through reverse engineering, performed either manually or via automated tools. Existing automated CAN bus reverse engineering methods are still time-consuming and require some manual effort, i.e., to inject diagnostic messages in order to trigger specific responses. In this paper, we propose CANMatch – a fully automated CAN bus reverse engineering framework that does not require any manual effort and significantly decreases the execution time by exploiting the reuse of CAN frames across different vehicle models. We evaluate the proposed solution on a dataset of CAN logs, or traces, related to 479 vehicles from 29 different automotive manufacturers, demonstrating its improved performance with respect to the state of the art.	https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9599500	no
Secure Estimation and Attack Isolation for Connected and Automated Driving in the Presence of Malicious Vehicles	Connected and Automated Vehicles (CAVs) rely on the correctness of position and other vehicle kinematics information to fulfill various driving tasks such as vehicle following, lane change, and collision avoidance. However, a malicious vehicle may send false sensor information to the other vehicles intentionally or unintentionally, which may cause traffic inconvenience or loss of human lives. Here, we take the advantage of vehicular cloud and increase the resilience of CAVs to malicious vehicles by assuming each vehicle shares its local sensor information with other vehicles to create information redundancy on the cloud side. We exploit this redundancy and propose a sensor fusion algorithm for the vehicular cloud, capable of providing robust state estimation of all vehicles under the condition that the number of malicious information is sufficiently small. Using the proposed estimator, we provide an algorithm for isolating malicious vehicles. We use numerical examples to illustrate the effectiveness of our methods.	https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9485094	no
Learning Self-Awareness for Autonomous Vehicles: Exploring Multisensory Incremental Models	The technology for autonomous vehicles is close to replacing human drivers by artificial systems endowed with high-level decision-making capabilities. In this regard, systems must learn about the usual vehicle's behavior to predict imminent difficulties before they happen. An autonomous agent should be capable of continuously interacting with multi-modal dynamic environments while learning unseen novel concepts. Such environments are not often available to train the agent on it, so the agent should have an understanding of its own capacities and limitations. This understanding is usually called self-awareness. This paper proposes a multi-modal self-awareness modeling of signals coming from different sources. This paper shows how different machine learning techniques can be used under a generic framework to learn single modality models by using Dynamic Bayesian Networks. In the presented case, a probabilistic switching model and a bank of generative adversarial networks are employed to model a vehicle's positional and visual information respectively. Our results include experiments performed on a real vehicle, highlighting the potentiality of the proposed approach at detecting abnormalities in real scenarios.	https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9069298	no
Quasi-LPV Interconnected Observer Design for Full Vehicle Dynamics Estimation With Hardware Experiments	Safety systems claim an in-depth study of vehicle motion and tire-ground interaction for the design of a partially automated driving vehicle. This article addresses the quasi-linear parameter-varying Luenberger interconnected fuzzy observer to estimate both longitudinal and lateral vehicle dynamics simultaneously. In a different manner from the commonplace state of the art of vehicle state observers that consider single driving motion, the proposed approach considers the coupled dynamics with the tire-ground interaction to estimate the most important states while reducing the complexity related to the observability and conservatism. This consideration leads to a nonlinear parameter-dependent interconnected model with unmeasured premise variables. Then, the Takagi-Sugeno fuzzy form is considered to deal with the nonlinearities of the vehicle longitudinal and lateral speeds and the slip velocities as well as the steering angle. The concept of “input to state stability” is exploited using fuzzy nonquadratic Lyapunov stability arguments to guarantee the boundness of the estimation errors. A refinement has been proposed through the so-called Polya's theorem aiming to further reduce the conservativeness. Finally, performances and effectiveness of the suggested approach are evaluated through hardware experiments performed with the well-known Sherpa dynamic car simulator under real-world driving situations.	https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9410440	no
Stop-and-Go: Exploring Backdoor Attacks on Deep Reinforcement Learning-Based Traffic Congestion Control Systems	Recent work has shown that the introduction of autonomous vehicles (AVs) in traffic could help reduce traffic jams. Deep reinforcement learning methods demonstrate good performance in complex control problems, including autonomous vehicle control, and have been used in state-of-the-art AV controllers. However, deep neural networks (DNNs) render automated driving vulnerable to machine learning-based attacks. In this work, we explore the backdooring/trojanning of DRL-based AV controllers. We develop a trigger design methodology that is based on well-established principles of traffic physics. The malicious actions include vehicle deceleration and acceleration to cause stop-and-go traffic waves to emerge (congestion attacks) or AV acceleration resulting in the AV crashing into the vehicle in front (insurance attack). We test our attack on single-lane and two-lane circuits. Our experimental results show that the backdoored model does not compromise normal operation performance, with the maximum decrease in cumulative rewards being 1%. Still, it can be maliciously activated to cause a crash or congestion when the corresponding triggers appear.	https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9541185	yes
Path Tracking Control of Autonomous Vehicles Subject to Deception Attacks via a Learning-Based Event-Triggered Mechanism	This article investigates the problem of event-triggered secure path tracking control of autonomous ground vehicles (AGVs) under deception attacks. To relieve the burden of the shareable vehicle communication network and to improve the tracking performance in the presence of deception attacks, a learning-based event-triggered mechanism (ETM) is proposed. Different from existing ETMs, the triggering threshold of the proposed mechanism can be dynamically adjusted with conditions of the latest vehicle state. Each vehicle in this study is deemed as an agent, under which a novel control strategy is developed for these autonomous agents with deception attacks. With the assistance of Lyapunov stability theory, sufficient conditions are obtained to guarantee the stability and stabilization of the overall system. Finally, a simulation example is provided to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed theoretical results.	https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9354512	maybe
RMPflow: A Geometric Framework for Generation of Multitask Motion Policies	Generating robot motion for multiple tasks in dynamic environments is challenging, requiring an algorithm to respond reactively while accounting for complex nonlinear relationships between tasks. In this article, we develop a novel policy synthesis algorithm, Riemannian motion policy (RMP)flow, based on geometrically consistent transformations of RMPs. RMPs are a class of reactive motion policies that parameterize non-Euclidean behaviors as dynamical systems in intrinsically nonlinear task spaces. Given a set of RMPs designed for individual tasks, RMPflow can combine these policies to generate an expressive global policy, while simultaneously exploiting sparse structure for computational efficiency. We study the geometric properties of RMPflow and provide sufficient conditions for stability. Finally, we experimentally demonstrate that accounting for the natural Riemannian geometry of task policies can simplify classically difficult problems, such as planning through the clutter on high-degree-of-freedom manipulation systems. Note to Practitioners—Requirements on safety and responsiveness for collaborative robots have driven a need for new ideas in control design that bridge between standard objectives in low-level control (such as trajectory tracking) and high-level behavioral objectives (such as collision avoidance) often relegated to planning systems. Modern results from geometric control, which promise stable controllers that can smoothly and safely transition between many behavioral tasks, therefore, become highly relevant. However, for years, this field has remained inaccessible due to its mathematical complexity. This article aims to: 1) make those ideas accessible to robotics and control experts by recasting them in a concrete algorithmic framework amenable to controller design and 2) to additionally generalize them to better satisfy the specific needs of robotic behavior generation. Our experiments demonstrate that the resulting controllers can engender natural behavior that adapts instantaneously to changing surroundings with zero planning while performing manipulation tasks. The framework is gaining traction within the robotics community, finding increasing application in areas, such as autonomous navigation, tactile servoing, and multi-agent systems. Future research will address learning these controllers from data to simplify that process of design and tuning, which at present can require experience.	https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9388869	no
S-MAPS: Scalable Mutual Authentication Protocol for Dynamic UAV Swarms	Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) domain has seen rapid developments in recent years. UAVs have been deployed for many applications and missions like data transmission, cellular service provisioning, and computational offloading tasks etc. Yet, UAV deployment is still limited, partially owing to the security challenges it poses. UAVs are particularly vulnerable to physical capture, cloning attacks, eavesdropping, and man in the middle attacks. To address some of these security problems, this paper develops an authentication protocol for use in UAV swarms. To ensure physical security and rapid authentication, the proposed protocol uses Physical Unclonable Functions (PUFs). The protocol achieves high scalability compared to the state of the art by authenticating multiple devices at once. The proposed protocol supports dynamic topologies and multi-hop communication by using spanning tree-based traversal. It is also resistant to mobility, device tampering attack, etc., and its improvements are achieved at significantly lower communication and communication cost as compared to state-of-the-art protocols.	https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9551779	no
BDFL: A Byzantine-Fault-Tolerance Decentralized Federated Learning Method for Autonomous Vehicle	Autonomous Vehicles ($AV$s) take advantage of Machine Learning (ML) for yielding improved experiences of self-driving. However, large-scale collection of $AV$s’ data for training will inevitably result in a privacy leakage problem. Federated Learning (FL) is proposed to solve privacy leakage problems, but it is exposed to security threats such as model inversion, membership inference. Therefore, the vulnerability of the FL should be brought to the forefront when applying to $AV$s. We propose a novel Byzantine-Fault-Tolerant (BFT) decentralized FL method with privacy-preservation for $AV$s called BDFL. In this paper, a Peer-to-Peer (P2P) FL with BFT is built by extending the HydRand protocol. In order to protect their model, each $AV$ uses the Publicly Verifiable Secret Sharing(PVSS) scheme, which allows anyone to verify the correctness of encrypted shares. The evaluation results on the MNIST dataset have shown that introducing decentralized FL into $ AV$ area is feasible, and the proposed BDFL is superior to other BFT-based FL method. Furthermore, the experimental results on KITTI dataset indicate the practicality of BDFL on improving performances of multi-object recognition in $ AV$ areas. Finally, the proposed PVSS-based data privacy preservation scheme is also justified its characteristic of no side-effect on models’ parameters by the experiments on the MNIST and KITTI datasets.	https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9507294	maybe
Unsupervised Identification of Surgical Robotic Actions From Small Non-Homogeneous Datasets	Robot-assisted surgery is an established clinical practice. The automatic identification of surgical actions is needed for a range of applications, including performance assessment of trainees and surgical process modeling for autonomous execution and monitoring. However, supervised action identification is not feasible, due to the burden of manually annotating recordings of potentially complex and long surgical executions. Moreover, often few example executions of a surgical procedure can be recorded. This letter proposes a novel fast algorithm for unsupervised identification of surgical actions in a standard surgical training task, the ring transfer, executed with da Vinci Research Kit. Exploiting kinematic and semantic visual features automatically extracted from a very limited dataset of executions, we are able to significantly outperform state-of-the-art results on a dataset of non-expert executions (58% vs. 24% F1-score), and improve performance in the presence of noise, short actions and non-homogeneous workflows, i.e. non repetitive action sequences.	https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9514470	no
Towards Ultra Reliable Low Latency Multipath TCP for Connected Autonomous Vehicles	Connected Autonomous Vehicles (CAVs) are Not-So-Futuristic. CAVs will be highly dynamic by intelligently exploiting multipath communication over several radio technologies, such as high-speed WiFi and 5G and beyond networks. Yet, the likelihood of data communication loss can be very high and/, or packets arrive at the destination not in correct working order due to erratic and mixed time-varying wireless links. Furthermore, the vehicular data traffic is susceptible to loss and delay variation, which recommends the need to investigate new multipath TCP (MPTCP) protocols for ultra-reliable low latency communication (URLLC) over such heterogeneous networks while reassuring CAVs' needs. We undertake the challenge by jointly considering network coding and balanced linked adaptation for performing coupled congestion control across multiple wireless paths. Consequently, the proposed low delay MPTCP framework for connecting autonomous vehicles is efficient and intelligent by design. We conduct a rigorous convergence analysis of the MPTCP design framework. In summation, we provide a detailed mathematical study and demonstrate that the latency penalty for the URLLC-MPTCP developed over these networks becomes negligible when considering the possible benefits that multiple network convergence could offer. Our extensive emulation results demonstrate all these lucrative features of URLLC-MPTCP.	https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9468697	no
Fault Detection Filter and Controller Co-Design for Unmanned Surface Vehicles Under DoS Attacks	This paper addresses the co-design problem of a fault detection filter and controller for a networked-based unmanned surface vehicle (USV) system subject to communication delays, external disturbance, faults, and aperiodic denial-of-service (DoS) jamming attacks. First, an event-triggering communication scheme is proposed to enhance the efficiency of network resource utilization while counteracting the impact of aperiodic DoS attacks on the USV control system performance. Second, an event-based switched USV control system is presented to account for the simultaneous presence of communication delays, disturbance, faults, and DoS jamming attacks. Third, by using the piecewise Lyapunov functional (PLF) approach, criteria for exponential stability analysis and co-design of a desired observer-based fault detection filter and an event-triggered controller are derived and expressed in terms of linear matrix inequalities (LMIs). Finally, the simulation results verify the effectiveness of the proposed co-design method. The results show that this method not only ensures the safe and stable operation of the USV but also reduces the amount of data transmissions.	https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8985406	no
Autonomous Vehicle: Security by Design	Security of (semi)-autonomous vehicles is a growing concern, first, due to the increased exposure of the functionality to potential attackers; second, due to the reliance of functionalities on diverse (semi)-autonomous systems; third, due to the interaction of a single-vehicle with myriads of other smart systems in urban traffic infrastructure. Beyond these technical issues, we argue that the security-by-design principle for smart and complex autonomous systems, such as an Autonomous Vehicle (AV) is poorly understood and rarely practiced. Unlike traditional IT systems, where the risk mitigation techniques and adversarial models are well studied and developed with security design principles such as security perimeter and defense-in-depth, the lack of such a framework for connected autonomous systems is plaguing the design and implementation of a secure AV. We attempt to identify the core issues of securing an AV. This is done methodically by developing a security-by-design framework for AV from the first principles. Subsequently, the technical challenges for AV security are identified.	https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9130160	no
Towards an Autonomous Robot-Assistant for Laparoscopy Using Exteroceptive Sensors: Feasibility Study and Implementation	A new autonomous camera-holder robotic system for Laparoscopic Surgery (LS) is presented in this paper. In the proposed system, a 7-DoF collaborative robot holds and moves the laparoscope, or surgical camera, so that it permanently points towards the instruments' tips. A motion capture (MoCap) system, tracking online the surgical instruments, provides the robot's controller with instrument's motion data. Unlike the existing systems, this paper proposes an autonomous robot-assistant, freeing up surgeons from the laparoscope motion control, fully responding to the surgical community requirements. Moreover, a fully compliance control law is implemented. In task-space, it is suitable for smoothing robot movements and reducing the contact forces generated at the trocar. Null-space is also exploited through a compliance control law restricting the elbow's robot motion into a desired range, defined to avoid undesired collisions with the rest of the medical equipment. Robot Operating System (ROS) framework has been used to establish the communication between the robot and MoCap system, using the UDP protocol for data exchange. Training tasks, such as suturing training, have been performed by surgeons to validate the usefulness of the proposed platform, proving that a collaborative robot can autonomously comply with camera-holder assistant tasks.	https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9477029	no
An Efficient and Secure Certificate-Based Access Control and Key Agreement Scheme for Flying Ad-Hoc Networks	The evolution of Flying Ad-hoc Networks (FANETs) marks the paradigm shift from a single large drone to multiple small drones linked together in an ad-hoc fashion. To maintain the Quality of Service (QoS) in the multi-hop networking schema, FANETs utilize the available resources efficiently. However, due to open wireless boundary and high mobility of the drones, the FANETs are vulnerable to malicious nodes that can penetrate the network and, thus, pose serious security threats, particularly at the Medium Access Control (MAC) layer. Such susceptibility compromises the network security and privacy and harms the information exchange operation within the network. The attacker can either transmit a large number of reservation requests to waste the bandwidth, listen to the control messages, conduct power-efficient jamming or falsify the information to manipulate the network control. Therefore, secure access control and a key agreement mechanism are required. The mechanism must utilize the two phases, i.e., node authentication and key agreement, to counter the aforementioned attacks. Our contribution, in this paper, is a certificate-based access control and key agreement scheme, which is based on the technique of Hyperelliptic Curve Cryptography (HECC) and employs a collision-resistant one-way cryptographic hash function. In order to assess the viability and performance of the proposed scheme, we analyze it using formal security analysis techniques, such as the Real-Or-Random (ROR) model and Automated Validation of Internet Security Protocols and Applications (AVISPA) tool. The scheme is also evaluated using the informal security analysis technique, or the non-mathematical approach. The results obtained from both analyses affirm the superiority of our proposed scheme.	https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9345380	no
Hierarchical MPC for Robust Eco-Cooling of Connected and Automated Vehicles and Its Application to Electric Vehicle Battery Thermal Management	Connected and autonomous vehicles (CAVs) have situational awareness that can be exploited for optimal power and thermal management. In this article, we develop a hierarchical model predictive control (H-MPC) strategy for eco-cooling of CAVs, which reduces energy consumption through real-time prediction and multi-timescale and multi-layer optimization. The application of the proposed H-MPC is studied for battery thermal and energy management of an electric vehicle (EV). Our H-MPC approach addresses the uncertainty in the long-term preview of the vehicle speed through robust constraint handling to prevent constraint violation. The simulation results show that compared with a conventional battery thermal management (BTM) strategy, the proposed robust H-MPC saves the battery energy by up to 5.4% under the uncertainties in the long-term vehicle speed predictions in an urban CAV operation scenario.	https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9027885	no
Robust Set-Invariance Based Fuzzy Output Tracking Control for Vehicle Autonomous Driving Under Uncertain Lateral Forces and Steering Constraints	This paper is concerned with a new control method for path tracking of autonomous ground vehicles. We exploit the fuzzy model-based control framework to deal with the time-varying feature of the vehicle speed and the highly uncertain behaviors of the tire-road forces involved in the nonlinear vehicle dynamics. To avoid using costly vehicle sensors for feedback control while favoring the simplest control structure for real-time implementation, a new fuzzy static output feedback (SOF) scheme is proposed. In particular, though the robust set-invariance property and Lyapunov-based arguments, the physical constraints on the steering input saturation and the vehicle state can be taken into account in the control design to improve the driving safety and comfort. The theoretical development relies on the use of fuzzy Lyapunov functions and the non-parallel distributed compensation control concept to reduce the design conservatism. Exploiting some specific convexification techniques, the control design is reformulated as an optimization problem under linear matrix inequalities with a single line search, which are efficiently solved via semidefinite programming techniques. The proposed fuzzy path tracking controller is evaluated through various dynamic driving tests conducted with high-fidelity CarSim/Matlab co-simulations. Moreover, to emphasize the advantages of the new fuzzy SOF controller, a performance comparison with the CarSim driver model is also performed.	https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9204811	no
Adversarial Attack Against Urban Scene Segmentation for Autonomous Vehicles	Understanding the surrounding environment is crucial for autonomous vehicles to make correct driving decisions. In particular, urban scene segmentation is a significant integral module commonly equipped in the perception system of autonomous vehicles to understand the real scene like a human. Any missegmentation of the driving scenario can potentially result in uncontrollable consequences such as serious accidents or the exception of the perception system. In this article, we investigate the vulnerability of the popular scene segmentation models designed with the backbones of deep neural networks (DNNs), which have been shown to be sensitive to adversarial attacks. Specifically, we propose an iterative projected gradient-based attack method that can effectively fool several DNN-based segmentation models with a remarkably higher attacking successful rate, and much smaller adversarial perturbations. Moreover, we also develop an adversarial training algorithm with min-max optimization style to enrich the robustness of the scene segmentation models. Extensive experiments on the Cityscape benchmark dataset consisting of large-scale urban scene images for autonomous vehicles demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed attack method, as well as the benefit of the adversarial training scheme for the scene segmentation models.	https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9200583	yes
Security Enhancement for Real-Time Independent In-Vehicle CAN-FD Messages in Vehicular Networks	The rise of autonomous driving technology and the prosperity of mobile vehicular applications have brought tremendous pressure and put forward high bandwidth and low latency requirements for vehicular networks. Controller Area Network with Flexible Data-rate (CAN-FD) is a feasible choice to meet the high bandwidth and low latency requirements of in-vehicle communication of mobile vehicles. However, CAN-FD is vulnerable to masquerade attacks because it lacks necessary security authentication mechanisms and protection measures. This study presents a security enhancement technique called forward-backward exploration for independent in-vehicle CAN-FD messages while still guaranteeing each message is real-time. In the forward-backward exploration solution, a novel dual-pointer (including the forward pointer and the backward pointer) solution is proposed; the Message Authentication Code (MAC) size of each message is then dynamically adjusted by presenting the dual-pointer movement rules until the total payload no longer increases. Experimental results with real-life CAN-FD message set provided by an automaker demonstrate the effectiveness of our solution.	https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9362294	no
Vehicle Localization via Cooperative Channel Mapping	This paper addresses vehicle positioning, a topic whose importance has risen dramatically in the context of future autonomous driving systems. While classical methods that use GPS and/or beacon signals from network infrastructure for triangulation tend to be sensitive to multi-paths and signal obstruction, our method exhibits robustness with respect to such phenomena. Our approach builds on the recently proposed Channel-SLAM method which first enabled leveraging of multi-path so as to improve (single) vehicle positioning. Here, we propose a cooperative mapping approach which builds upon the Channel-SLAM concept, referred to here as Team Channel-SLAM. Team Channel-SLAM not only exploits the stationary nature of many reflecting objects around the vehicle, but also capitalizes on the multi-vehicle nature of road traffic. The key intuition behind our method is the exploitation for the first time of the correlation between reflectors around multiple neighboring vehicles. An algorithm is derived for reflector selection and estimation, combined with a team particle filter (TPF) so as to achieve high precision simultaneous multiple vehicle positioning. We obtain large improvement over the single-vehicle positioning scenario, with gains being already noticeable for moderate vehicle densities, such as over 40% improvement for a vehicle density as low as 4 vehicles in 132 meters' length road.	https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9405441	no
Efficient and Secured Swarm Pattern Multi-UAV Communication	Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) or drone, is an evolving technology in today's market with an enormous number of applications. Mini UAVs are developed in order to compensate the performance constraints imposed by larger UAVs during emergency situations. Multiple mini autonomous UAVs require communication and coordination for ubiquitous coverage and relaying during deployment. Multi-UAV coordination or swarm optimization is required for reliable connectivity among UAVs, due to its high mobility and dynamic topology. In this paper, a Secured UAV (S-UAV) model is proposed which takes the location of the UAVs as inputs to form a Wireless Mesh Network (WMN) among multiple drones with the help of a centralized controller. After WMN formation, efficient communication takes place using A* search, an intelligent algorithm that finds the shortest communication path among UAVs. Further, the S-UAV model utilizes cryptographic techniques such as Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) and Blowfish to overcome the security attacks efficiently. Simulation results show that the S-UAV model offers higher throughput, reduced power consumption and guaranteed message transmission with reduced encryption and decryption time.	https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9437802	no
Cyclic Communication in Adaptive Strategies to Platooning: The Case of Synchronized Merging	Recently proposed adaptive platooning strategies for connected automated vehicles are able to address uncertain parameters of the vehicles in the platoon (uncertain driveline time constants), but are limited to acyclic interaction like look-ahead interaction. This restrains from augmenting platooning protocols with synchronized merging maneuvers, where cyclic communication is needed and creates algebraic loops that require well posedness of the inputs. We propose an adaptive protocol for synchronized merging in the cyclic communication scenario. The protocol exploits a set of adaptive control strategies, designed to cope with uncertain driveline time constants. Well-posedness of the control inputs is proven in a distributed way (using information from neighboring vehicles) in spite of uncertainty and cyclic communication. The proposed strategy is shown in a benchmark merging scenario.	https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9277618	no
Robust Adaptive Tracking Control of Underwater Vehicles: Design, Stability Analysis, and Experiments	The unpredictable nature of the marine environment, combined with nonlinear dynamics and parameter uncertainty of underwater vehicles makes the control system design for such vehicles a challenging task. Based on these issues, hybridizing robustness and adaptation in the control system could result in more successful marine missions. This article proposes a robust adaptive control (RAC) scheme for trajectory tracking of an autonomous underwater vehicle. The proposed RAC scheme has been developed by exploiting the advantages of a robust sliding mode controller and an adaptation law. Lyapunov arguments are proposed to prove the exponential stability and finite-time convergence of the resulting closed-loop dynamics tracking error to an invariant set, S (very close to zero). Scenarios-based real-time experiments are conducted with the Leonard ROV prototype to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed RAC approach. The control design performance indices (root mean square error, integral absolute error, and integral square error) and a comparative analysis with a recent control scheme from the literature confirm the interest of the proposed RAC scheme for marine applications.	https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9151367	no
Feasibility Study of UAV-Assisted Anti-Jamming Positioning	As the cost and technical difficulty of jamming devices continue to decrease, jamming has become one of the major threats to positioning service. Unfortunately, most conventional wireless positioning technologies are vulnerable to jamming attacks due to inherent shortcomings like weak signal strength and unfavorable anchor geometry. Thanks to their high operational flexibility, unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) could be a promising solution to the above challenges. Therefore, in this article, we propose a UAV-assisted anti-jamming positioning system, in which multiple UAVs first utilize time-difference-of-arrival (TDoA) measurements from ground reference stations and double-response two-way ranging (DR-TWR) measurements from UAV-to-UAV links to perform self-localization as well as clock synchronization, and then act as anchor nodes to provide TDoA positioning service for ground users in the presence of jamming. To evaluate the feasibility and performance of the proposed system, we first derive the Cramér-Rao lower bound (CRLB) of UAV self-localization. Then, the impacts of UAV position uncertainty and synchronization errors caused by jamming on positioning service are modeled, and the theoretical root-mean-square error (RMSE) of user position estimate is further derived. Numerical results demonstrate that the proposed system is a promising alternative to existing positioning systems when their services are disrupted by jamming. The most notable advantage of the proposed system is that it is fully compatible with existing user equipment terminals and positioning methods.	https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9460757	no
Adaptive Resilient Event-Triggered Control Design of Autonomous Vehicles With an Iterative Single Critic Learning Framework	This article investigates the adaptive resilient event-triggered control for rear-wheel-drive autonomous (RWDA) vehicles based on an iterative single critic learning framework, which can effectively balance the frequency/changes in adjusting the vehicle’s control during the running process. According to the kinematic equation of RWDA vehicles and the desired trajectory, the tracking error system during the autonomous driving process is first built, where the denial-of-service (DoS) attacking signals are injected into the networked communication and transmission. Combining the event-triggered sampling mechanism and iterative single critic learning framework, a new event-triggered condition is developed for the adaptive resilient control algorithm, and the novel utility function design is considered for driving the autonomous vehicle, where the control input can be guaranteed into an applicable saturated bound. Finally, we apply the new adaptive resilient control scheme to a case of driving the RWDA vehicles, and the simulation results illustrate the effectiveness and practicality successfully.	https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9346029	no
Data-Driven Ambiguity Sets With Probabilistic Guarantees for Dynamic Processes	Distributional ambiguity sets provide quantifiable ways to characterize the uncertainty about the true probability distribution of random variables of interest. This makes them a key element in data-driven robust optimization by exploiting high-confidence guarantees to hedge against uncertainty. This article explores the construction of Wasserstein ambiguity sets in dynamic scenarios, where data are collected progressively and may only reveal partial information about the unknown random variable. For random variables evolving according to known dynamics, we leverage assimilated samples to make inferences about their unknown distribution at the end of the sampling horizon. Under exact knowledge of the flow map, we provide sufficient conditions that relate the growth of the trajectories with the sampling rate to establish a reduction of the ambiguity set size as the horizon increases. Furthermore, we characterize the exploitable sample history that results in a guaranteed reduction of ambiguity sets under errors in the computation of the flow and when the dynamics is subject to bounded unknown disturbances. Our treatment deals with both full- and partial-state measurements and, in the latter case, exploits the sampled-data observability properties of linear time-varying systems under irregular sampling. Simulations on an unmanned aerial vehicle detection application show the superior performance resulting from the proposed dynamic ambiguity sets.	https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9157949	no
Self-organized search-attack mission planning for UAV swarm based on wolf pack hunting behavior	Cooperative search-attack is an important application of unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) swarm in military field. The coupling between path planning and task allocation, the heterogeneity of UAVs, and the dynamic nature of task environment greatly increase the complexity and difficulty of the UAV swarm cooperative search-attack mission planning problem. Inspired by the collaborative hunting behavior of wolf pack, a distributed self-organizing method for UAV swarm search-attack mission planning is proposed. First, to solve the multi-target search problem in unknown environments, a wolf scouting behavior-inspired cooperative search algorithm for UAV swarm is designed. Second, a distributed self-organizing task allocation algorithm for UAV swarm cooperative attacking of targets is proposed by analyzing the flexible labor division behavior of wolves. By abstracting the UAV as a simple artificial wolf agent, the flexible motion planning and group task coordinating for UAV swarm can be realized by self-organizing. The effectiveness of the proposed method is verified by a set of simulation experiments, the stability and scalability are evaluated, and the integrated solution for the coupled path planning and task allocation problems for the UAV swarm cooperative search-attack task can be well performed.	https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9679714	no
Adaptive and Optimum Secret Key Establishment for Secure Vehicular Communications	In intelligent transportation systems (ITS), communications between vehicles, i.e. vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) communications are of greatest importance to facilitate autonomous driving. The current state-of-the-art for secure data exchange in V2V communications relies on public-key cryptography (PKC) consuming significant computational and energy resources for the encryption/decryption process and large bandwidth for the key distribution. To overcome these limitations, physical-layer security (PLS) has emerged as a lightweight solution by exploiting the physical characteristics of the V2V communication channel to generate symmetric cryptographic keys. Currently, key-generation algorithms are designed via empirical parameter settings, without resulting in optimum key-generation performance. In this paper, we devise a key-generation algorithm for PLS in V2V communications by introducing a novel channel response quantisation method that results in optimum performance via analytical parameter settings. Contrary to the current state-of-the-art, the channel responses incorporate all V2V channel attributes that contribute to temporal variability, such as three dimensional (3D) scattering and scatterers' mobility. An extra functionality, namely, Perturbe-Observe (PO), is further incorporated that enables the algorithm to adapt to the inherent non-reciprocity of the V2V channel responses at the legitimate entities. Optimum performance is evidenced via maximisation of the key bit generation rate (BGR) and key entropy (H) and minimisation of the key bit mismatch rate (BMR). A new metric is further introduced, the so-called secret-bit generation rate (SBGR), as the ratio of the number of bits which are successfully used to compose keys to the total amount of channel samples. SBGR unifies BGR and BMR and is thus maximised by the proposed algorithmic process.	https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9346002	no
Aerial Vehicles Tracking Using Noncoherent Crowdsourced Wireless Networks	Air traffic management (ATM) of manned and unmanned aerial vehicles (AVs) relies critically on ubiquitous location tracking. While technologies exist for AVs to broadcast their location periodically and for airports to track and detect AVs, methods to verify the broadcast locations and complement the ATM coverage are urgently needed, addressing anti-spoofing and safe coexistence concerns. In this work, we propose an ATM solution by exploiting noncoherent crowdsourced wireless networks (CWNs) and correcting the inherent clock-synchronization problems present in such non-coordinated sensor networks. While CWNs can provide a great number of measurements for ubiquitous ATM, these are normally obtained from unsynchronized sensors. This article first presents an analysis of the effects of lack of clock synchronization in ATM with CWN and provides solutions based on the presence of few trustworthy sensors in a large non-coordinated network. Secondly, autoregressive-based and long short-term memory (LSTM)-based approaches are investigated to achieve the time synchronization needed for localization of the AVs. Finally, a combination of a multilateration (MLAT) method and a Kalman filter is employed to provide an anti-spoofing tracking solution for AVs. We demonstrate the performance advantages of our framework through a dataset collected by a real-world CWN. Our results show that the proposed framework achieves localization accuracy comparable to that acquired using only GPS-synchronized sensors and outperforms the localization accuracy obtained based on state-of-the-art CWN synchronization methods.	https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9512485	no
A Multi-Channel MAC Protocol With Retrodirective Array Antennas in Flying Ad Hoc Networks	In this paper, we propose a multi-channel medium access control (MMAC) protocol for the exploitation of retro-directive array antennas in Flying Ad Hoc Networks (named FA-MMAC). This FA-MMAC employs multiple channels and retro-directive array antennas to adjacent unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) to transmit simultaneously over the same channel without causing interference. The channel utilization characteristic of FA-MMAC increases the spatial reuse of channel and thus improve the system performance. The key idea is that UAVs first exchange control packets in control window to select data channels and to align beams before exchanging data packets in the data window. In this way, the hidden-terminal and deafness problems are reduced. UAVs can reserve channels and align beams through a circular directional transmission of control frames so that the protocol can take advantage of the benefits of retro-directive array antennas of spatial reuse and increased coverage without prior knowledge of the locations. We develop both antenna model and channel model for FA-MMAC protocol. Analysis and simulation results show that our proposed FA-MMAC can offer a significant performance gain for both static and mobile scenarios than the existing MMAC and 802.11-based protocols. Our findings reported in this paper provide some insights into the performance of multi-channel Flying Ad Hoc Networks which might help network researchers to contribute in the development of next generation UAVs.	https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9337221	no
Performance Trade-Off in UAV-Aided Wireless-Powered Communication Networks via Multi-Objective Optimization	In this paper, we study an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV)-enabled wireless powered communication network, where a UAV serves multiple energy constrained wireless sensor nodes (WSNs). In such a network, a UAV transmits wireless power to a group of WSNs which exploits the harvested power to transfer their own information towards the UAV in the uplink. For practical scenarios, a nonlinear energy harvesting saturation model is considered at WSNs. We aim to design resource allocation which maximizes the achievable sum rate in the uplink and minimizes the downlink transmit power simultaneously. The design is formulated as a multi-objective optimization problem (MOOP) which optimizes the UAV's 3D position, its transmit power, the time splitting ratio, the uplink transmission time and the beamwidth angle of the UAV. The formulated problem is a non-convex problem which is generally intractable. To address the MOOP, a weighted Tchebycheff method is proposed. The numerical results show a trade-off between the minimum power in the downlink and the maximum rate as well as energy efficiency in the uplink.	https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9583909	no
Avalanche Victim Search via Robust Observers	This article deals with the problem of victim localization in avalanches by using controlled unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) equipped with an electromagnetic sensor (known as ARVA) typically adopted in these search and rescue scenarios. We show that the nominal ARVA measurement can be linearly related to a quantity that is sufficient to reconstruct the victim position. We explicitly deal with a robust scenario in which the measurement is actually perturbed by the noise that grows with the distance to the victim and propose an adaptive control scheme based on a least-square identifier and a trajectory generator whose role is both to guarantee the persistence of excitation for the identifier and to steer the ARVA receiver toward the victim. We prove that the controller ensures boundedness of trajectories and enables to localize the victim in a domain where the ARVA output is sufficiently informative. We illustrate its performance in a realistic simulation framework specifically developed with real data. The proposed approach could significantly reduce the searching time by providing an exploitable estimate before having reached the victim.	https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9195790	no
Softwarized Industrial Deterministic Networking Based on Unmanned Aerial Vehicles	Guaranteeing network transmission is one of the most challenging issues in industrial informatization. In the industrial sites without proper networking infrastructure, by deploying unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV), transmission-oriented cyber-physical system (CPS) is an excellent candidate to exploit to provide transmission. In this article, we focus on establishing deterministic network transmission (DNT) using UAV-based CPS, complying with the principles in time sensitive network/deterministic networking in industrial internet. The software-defined networking (SDN) paradigm is adopted for UAVs-based CPS to achieve global optimization. First, we build the coordinate-based global topology view in the SDN controller to manage and control UAVs by integrating UAVs into the view and applying the network positioning method. Then, we introduce a hop-limited time synchronization approach to improve accuracy by reducing synchronization deviation. Last, based on the view, a geometric multipath generating method is proposed to enhance reliability by reducing the joint degree of multiple paths and facilitating convergence. The extensive simulation experiments show that our proposed UAV-CPS allows DNT to provide better reliability with reduced latency.	https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9234619	no
The Outage-Free Replacement Problem in Unmanned Aerial Vehicle Base Stations	Thanks to the feature of on-demand and flexible deployment, unmanned aerial vehicle base stations (UAV-BS) can enhance coverage and capacity beyond current 5 G cellular networks. The main challenge in deploying UAV-BS lies in the fact that the limited battery in UAB-BS cannot support long-time reliable services. Therefore, a serving UAV-BS being running out its power needs to be replaced with a new fully-charged UAV-BS. This is called UAV-BS replacement process. However, most existing UAV-BS replacement methods ignore the link outage problem during the replacement. Thus the outage-free replacement problem (OFRP) for UAV-BSs arises. We provide a method to calculate the outage probability of the UAV replacement approach. We further formulate the Outage Probability Minimization Problem (OPMP) for UAV-BS replacement. To solve this problem, a 3-Dimensional Outage-Free Replacement Approach (3D-OFRA) is presented, which exploits different heights of swapping UAV-BSs during the replacement process. More importantly, we provide the guidelines of determining the distance between two UAV-BSs to minimize the link outage possibility during the UAV-BS replacement process. Our numerical results show that with the recommended distance between two UAV-BSs based on 3D-OFRA, the outage probability of the served UEs approaches to zero, compared with 40% of the traditional direct replacement approach.	https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9555387	no
Covert Attacks Through Adversarial Learning: Study of Lane Keeping Attacks on the Safety of Autonomous Vehicles	Road management systems are to improve in terms of integrity, mobility, sustainability, and safety by the adoption of artificial intelligence and Internet of Things services. This article introduces the concept of covert attacks on autonomous vehicles which can jeopardize the safety of passengers. Covert attacks are designed to manipulate outputs of cyber physical systems through network channels in a way that while the changes are not easily perceptible by human beings, systems are negatively affected in the long run. We argue that future smart vehicles are vulnerable to viruses which can use adversarial learning methods to adapt themselves to hosts and remain stealth for a long period. As a case study, we design a covert attack on the lane keeping system of autonomous vehicles. In the scenario, an intelligent adversary manipulates sensor readings (lane position, curvature, etc.) in order to deceive the controller to drive the vehicle closer to the boundaries. The virus/attacker interactively learns the host vehicle behaviors in terms of lateral deviation and maneuverability and tries to increase the errors to the extent that remains unnoticeable to the driver. This process is carried out through actor-critic learning based on the Newton--Raphson method. We additionally design an intrusion detection system for such covert attacks. We use the GPS data and offline maps to reconstruct road curves and match them against readings. A simulation testbed is developed based on the map of Nurburgring-Grand Prix track to evaluate our models. Results confirm the validity and effectiveness of the proposed models.	https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9373943	yes
Novel Deep Learning-Enabled LSTM Autoencoder Architecture for Discovering Anomalous Events From Intelligent Transportation Systems	Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS), especially Autonomous Vehicles (AVs), are vulnerable to security and safety issues that threaten the lives of the people. Unlike manual vehicles, the security of communications and computing components of AVs can be compromised using advanced hacking techniques, thus barring AVs from the effective use in our routine lives. Once manual vehicles are connected to the Internet, called the Internet of Vehicles (IoVs), it would be exploited by cyber-attacks, like denial of service, sniffing, distributed denial of service, spoofing and replay attacks. In this article, we present a deep learning-based Intrusion Detection System (IDS) for ITS, in particular, to discover suspicious network activity of In-Vehicles Networks (IVN), vehicles to vehicles (V2V) communications and vehicles to infrastructure (V2I) networks. A Deep Learning architecture-based Long-Short Term Memory (LSTM) autoencoder algorithm is designed to recognize intrusive events from the central network gateways of AVs. The proposed IDS is evaluated using two benchmark datasets, i.e., the car hacking dataset for in-vehicle communications and the UNSW-NB15 dataset for external network communications. The experimental results demonstrated that our proposed system achieved over a 99% accuracy for detecting all types of attacks on the car hacking dataset and a 98% accuracy on the UNSW-NB15 dataset, outperforming other eight intrusion detection techniques.	https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9198908	yes
In-Vehicle Infotainment Systems: Using Bayesian Networks to Model Cognitive Selection of Music Genres	In the world of transportation, the ceaseless evolution of Information and Communication Technologies (ICT) is reflected on their migration towards In-Vehicle-Infotainment (IVI) systems, which are characterized by innovative applications and services. Such systems aim to support drivers/passengers with a varying set of functions, enhancing the quality of driving through entertainment. The goal of this study is to introduce a novel IVI cognitive functionality that automatically and dynamically proposes the optimal music genre to the drivers/users when they want to make a certain journey with their owned (or shared) vehicles. The proposed recommender functionality utilizes in an automated manner (i) drivers/users’ profile data and current situation, (ii) drivers/users’ personal preferences, (iii) external environment information obtained from sensor measurements, and (iv) previous knowledge and experience. Knowledge is obtained through the exploitation of Bayesian networking principles in combination with a practical implementation of the Naive-Bayes model. Indicative simulation results showcase the efficiency of the proposed infotainment functionality, in terms of accuracy and speed of convergence, in proactively identifying the optimal music genre and accordingly notifying the drivers/users.	https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9110903	no
INS/Odometer Land Navigation by Accurate Measurement Modeling and Multiple-Model Adaptive Estimation	Land vehicle navigation based on the inertial navigation system (INS) and odometers (ODs) is a classical autonomous navigation application and has been extensively studied over the past several decades. In this article, we seriously analyze the error characteristics of the OD pulses and investigate three types of OD measurement models in the INS/OD integrated system. Specifically, in the pulse velocity model, a preliminary Kalman filter is designed to obtain an accurate vehicle velocity from the accumulated pulses; the pulse increment model is accordingly obtained by integrating the pulse velocity; a new pulse accumulation model is proposed by augmenting the traveled distance into the system state. The three types of measurements, along with the nonholonomic constraint, are implemented in the standard extended Kalman filter. In view of the motion-related pulse error characteristics, the multiple model adaptive estimation (MMAE) approach is exploited to further enhance the performance. Simulations and long-distance experiments are conducted to verify the feasibility and effectiveness of the proposed methods. It is shown that the standard pulse velocity measurement achieves superior performance, whereas the accumulated pulse measurement is most favorable with the MMAE enhancement.	https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9149695	no
Deep Learning Based Autonomous Vehicle Super Resolution DOA Estimation for Safety Driving	In this paper, a novel system architecture including a massive multi-input multi-output (MIMO) or a reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS) and multiple autonomous vehicles is considered in vehicle location systems. The location parameters of autonomous vehicles can be estimated based on the deep unfolding technique, which is a recent advance of deep learning. Traditional vehicle location methods such as the global position system (GPS) can only locate the target vehicles with relatively low accuracy. The super resolution cannot be achieved when two vehicles are too close, which means that the safety incidents exist when autonomous vehicles are deployed in future intelligent transportation systems (ITS). Different from the existing massive MIMO or RIS equipped with a regular array such as uniform rectangular array (URA) and uniform circular array (UCA), we exploit a massive MIMO or a RIS equipped with a conformal array extended from traditional regular array. First, the rotation from the global coordinate system to the local coordinate system is achieved based on geometric algebra. Second, 2D-DOA estimation of autonomous vehicles is modeled as a novel block sparse recovery problem. Third, the deep network architecture SBLNet is implemented to learn the nonlinear characteristic from the DOAs of autonomous vehicles and the data received by massive MIMOs or RISs. The 2D-DOA and polarization parameters can be estimated based on SBLNet with relatively low computational complexity. Simulation results demonstrate that SBLNet performs better than the state-of-the-art methods in terms of estimation accuracy and successful probability. The SBLNet is also suitable for the practical scenario considering fast moving autonomous vehicles, while, the traditional block sparse recovery methods fail in this complex scenario.	https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9173575	no
Distributed and Energy-Efficient Mobile Crowdsensing with Charging Stations by Deep Reinforcement Learning	Mobile crowdsensing (MCS) represents a new sensing paradigm that utilizes the smart mobile devices to collect and share data. Traditional MCS systems mainly leverages the people carried smartphones and other wearable devices which are constrained by the limited sensing capability and battery power. With the popularity of unmanned vehicles like unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) and driverless cars, they can provide much more reliable, accurate and cost-efficient sensing services due to to their equipped more powerful sensors. In this paper, we propose a distributed control framework for energy-efficient and DIstributed VEhicle navigation with chaRging sTations, called “e-Divert”. It is a distributed multi-agent deep reinforcement learning (DRL) solution, which uses a convolutional neural network (CNN) to extract useful spatial features as the input to the actor-critic network to produce a real-time action. Also, e-Divert incorporates a distributed prioritized experience replay for better exploration and exploitation, and a long short-term memory (LSTM) enabled N-step temporal sequence modeling module. The solution fully explores the spatiotemporal nature of the considered scenario for better vehicle cooperation and competition between themselves and charging stations, to maximize the energy efficiency, data collection ratio, geographic fairness, and minimize the energy consumption simultaneously. Through extensive simulations, we find an appropriate set of hyperparameters that achieve the best performance, i.e., 5 actors in Ape-X architecture, priority exponent 0.5, and LSTM sequence length 3. Finally, we compare with four baselines including one state-of-the-art approach MADDPG. Results show that our proposed e-Divert significantly improves the energy efficiency, as compared to MADDPG, by 3.62 and 2.36 times on average when varying different numbers of vehicles and charging stations, respectively.	https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8821415	no
Privacy-Aware Autonomous Valet Parking: Towards Experience Driven Approach	Driverless parking, an influential application of Mobility as a Service (MaaS) model, is one of the clear early benefits for autonomous vehicles, given often narrow spaces and multiple potential hazards (such as pedestrians stepping out from in between other vehicles). In recent years, real momentum has been building up for designing automated parking models for vehicles. However, in such an autonomous parking design, location privacy and identity privacy issues are always overlapping due to the improper sharing of data. Most existing studies barely investigate and poorly address such privacy issues. Motivated by this, we develop (and evaluate) an experience-driven, secure and privacy-aware framework of parking reservations for automated cars. Our idea of using differential privacy with zero-knowledge proof provides both security and privacy guarantees to users. Furthermore, the performance of the developed model is enhanced by exploiting reinforcement learning approach such that the utility of the system and the parking reservation rate can be maximized. Extensive evaluation demonstrates the superiority of the proposed model.	https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9141406	maybe
Autonomous Source Search for UAVs Using Gaussian Mixture Model-Based Infotaxis: Algorithm and Flight Experiments	Estimating and searching source information such as the location and release rate, called a source term, have many applications across environmental, medical, and security domains. The Bayesian inference framework is used to estimate the source term. Since the gas dispersion and its measurements in a turbulent environment are highly non-Gaussian and nonlinear, the particle filter, one of sequential Monte Carlo methods, is adopted in this article. For autonomous source term search in a turbulent environment, this article presents an information-theoretic search approach that combines a widely used Infotaxis approach with the Gaussian mixture model (GMM), termed as GMM-Infotaxis. The GMM is used to determine action candidates for the next best informative sampling position in a continuous domain by appropriately clustering possible source locations obtained from the particle filter. This facilitates a better trade-off between exploitation and exploration for autonomous source search. Through the outdoor experiments, on average, the estimation errors for localization and release rate of the source are reduced 74 and 73%, respectively, while the search time step of the mobile agent is decreased around 18%. Real outdoor flight experiments using a multirotor UAV in various experimental setups show the superior performance of the proposed approach compared with the original Infotaxis method.	https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9492004	no
Intelligent Reflecting Surface and UAV Assisted Secrecy Communication in Millimeter-Wave Networks	In this paper, we consider the secure transmission problem in an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) and intelligent reflecting surface (IRS) assisted mmWave networks in the presence of an eavesdropper. The UAV base station (UAV-BS) and IRS are deployed to overcome the blockages. Artificial noise (AN) is exploited against the eavesdropper. Aiming to maximize the secrecy rate, we jointly design the positions and beamforming of UAV-BS and IRS, where the positions here represent the deployed position of the UAV-BS and the activation position of the IRS. Meanwhile, the maximum transmits power, minimum height constraint for UAV-BS, and the legitimate receiver minimum rate constraint are required. To obtain the optimal UAV-BS position, the elevation angle-dependent probabilistic LoS air-to-ground channel is exploited in this network. To tackle the formulated non-convex problem, we divide it into two subproblems: (1) design UAV-BS and IRS positions; (2) design UAV-BS and IRS beamforming. Moreover, to reduce the complexity, we propose an ideal beamforming model to find the near-optimal positions of UAV-BS and IRS. Then, semidefinite relaxation (SDR) is utilized to cope with the highly coupled and high-dimensional variable vectors. Finally, we obtain a sub-optimal solution by an efficient and low-complexity alternating optimization algorithm. Numerical results demonstrate the improvement of secrecy rate by jointly designing the positions as well as the significant performance gains achieved by our proposed schemes over benchmark schemes.	https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9528924	no
A Blockchain-Based Deep Learning Approach for Cyber Security in Next Generation Industrial Cyber-Physical Systems	With the recent development of Internet of Things (IoT) in the next generation cyber-physical system (CPS) such as autonomous driving, there is a significant requirement of big data analysis with high accuracy and low latency. For efficient big data analysis, deep learning (DL) supports strong analytic capability; it has been applied at the cloud and edge layers by extensive research to provide accurate data analysis at low latency. However, existing researches failed to address certain challenges, such as centralized control, adversarial attacks, security, and privacy. To this end, we propose DeepBlockIoTNet, a secure DL approach with blockchain for the IoT network wherein the DL operation is carried out among the edge nodes at the edge layer in a decentralized, secure manner. The blockchain provides a secure DL operation and removes the control from a centralized authority. The experimental evaluation demonstrates that the proposed approach supports higher accuracy.	https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9272376	no
DRL-GAN: Dual-Stream Representation Learning GAN for Low-Resolution Image Classification in UAV Applications	Identifying tiny objects from extremely low-resolution (LR) unmanned-aerial-vehicle-based remote sensing images is generally considered as a very challenging task, because of very limited information in the object areas. In recent years, there have been very limited attempts to approach this problem. These attempts intend to deal with LR image classification by enhancing either the poor image quality or image representations. In this article, we argue that the performance improvement in LR image classification is affected by the inconsistency of the information loss and learning priority on low-frequency (LF) components and high-frequency (HF) components. To address this LF-HF inconsistency problem, we propose a dual-stream representation learning generative adversarial network (DRL-GAN). The core idea is to produce enhanced image representations optimal for LR recognition by simultaneously recovering the missing information in LF and HF components, respectively, under the guidance of high-resolution (HR) images. We evaluate the performance of DRL-GAN on the challenging task of LR image classification. A comparison of the experimental results on the LR benchmark, namely HRSC and CIFAR-10, and our newly collected `WIDER-SHIP' dataset demonstrates the effectiveness of our DRL-GAN, which significantly improves the classification performance, with up to 10% gain on average.	https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9286580	no
Threat Analysis for Automotive CAN Networks: A GAN Model-Based Intrusion Detection Technique	With the rapid development of Internet of vehicles, connected vehicles, autonomous vehicles, and autonomous driving technologies, automotive Controller Area Networks (CAN) have suffered from numerous security threats. Deep learning models are the current mainstream intrusion detection techniques for threat analysis, and the state-of-the-art intrusion detection technique introduces the Generative Adversarial Networks (GAN) model to generate usable attacked samples to supplement the training samples, but it exists the limitations of rough CAN message block construction and fails to detect the data tampering threat. Based on the CAN communication matrix defined by the automotive Original Equipment Manufacturer (OEM) for a vehicle model, we propose an enhanced deep learning GAN model with elaborate CAN message blocks and the enhanced GAN discriminator. The elaborate CAN message blocks in the training samples can precisely reflect the real generated CAN message blocks in the detection phase. The GAN discriminator can detect whether each message has suffered from the data tampering threat. Experimental results illustrate that the enhanced deep learning GAN model has higher detection accuracy, recall, and F1 scores than the state-of-the-art deep learning GAN model under various attacks and threats.	https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9352238	yes
Diffraction Signal-Based Human Recognition in Non-Line-of-Sight (NLOS) Situation for Millimeter Wave Radar	In driver assistance or self-driving systems, millimeter-wave radar is an indispensable sensing tool because of its applicability to all weather conditions or non-line-of-sight (NLOS) sensing. This study focuses on a human recognition issue in the NLOS scenario by applying the support vector machine (SVM)-based machine learning approach to a diffraction signal.We show that there is a significant difference in diffraction signals between man-made objects (e.g., metallic cylinder and human body) even without motion.Hence, by exploiting such difference, an SVM achieves a high recognition rate, even in deeply NLOS situations. The experimental investigation, using a 24-GHz millimeter-wave radar in an anechoic chamber demonstrates that a diffraction signal-based recognition accurately classifies the real human and human mimicking man-made object, even in the NLOS scenario shielded by the parking vehicle.	https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9405398	no
DynaNet: Neural Kalman Dynamical Model for Motion Estimation and Prediction	Dynamical models estimate and predict the temporal evolution of physical systems. State-space models (SSMs) in particular represent the system dynamics with many desirable properties, such as being able to model uncertainty in both the model and measurements, and optimal (in the Bayesian sense) recursive formulations, e.g., the Kalman filter. However, they require significant domain knowledge to derive the parametric form and considerable hand tuning to correctly set all the parameters. Data-driven techniques, e.g., recurrent neural networks, have emerged as compelling alternatives to SSMs with wide success across a number of challenging tasks, in part due to their impressive capability to extract relevant features from rich inputs. They, however, lack interpretability and robustness to unseen conditions. Thus, data-driven models are hard to be applied in safety-critical applications, such as self-driving vehicles. In this work, we present DynaNet, a hybrid deep learning and time-varying SSM, which can be trained end-to-end. Our neural Kalman dynamical model allows us to exploit the relative merits of both SSM and deep neural networks. We demonstrate its effectiveness in the estimation and prediction on a number of physically challenging tasks, including visual odometry, sensor fusion for visual-inertial navigation, and motion prediction. In addition, we show how DynaNet can indicate failures through investigation of properties, such as the rate of innovation (Kalman gain).	https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9547669	no
Accurate Detection and Localization of Unmanned Aerial Vehicle Swarms-Enabled Mobile Edge Computing System	Unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) swarms-enabled mobile edge computing system can be deployed in critical industrial zones for monitoring. Meanwhile, its malicious use may bring great threat to the security, and the accurate detection, and localization are important. UAV swarms show characteristics of the high density, small radar cross section, far range, and time-varying motion, and have posed formidable challenges to the accurate detection and localization. In this article, the accurate detection and localization of UAV swarms are investigated, and an effective method is proposed based on the Dechirp-keystone transform, and frequency-selective reweighted trace minimization. It inherits high robustness of the coherent long-time integration technique and superresolution of the gridless sparse technique. Mathematical analyzes and numerical simulations validate its superiorities in accurate detection and localization of UAV swarms.	https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9165125	no
Autonomous Learning of the Robot Kinematic Model	Robotics systems are becoming more and more autonomous and reconfigurable. In this context, the design of algorithms capable of deriving kinematics and dynamics models directly from data could be particularly useful. In this article, we present an algorithm that learns a forward kinematics model of a robot starting from a time series of visual observations. Our strategy can be applied to any robot with serial kinematics composed of revolute and prismatics joints. First, the algorithm identifies the robot kinematic structure, i.e., a high-level description of the robot geometry that defines the connections between the rigid-bodies composing the robot. Then, the algorithm derives the forward kinematics relying on a Gaussian process (GP) model. More precisely, the GP model is based on a polynomial kernel, defined exploiting the kinematic structure previously identified. The effectiveness of the proposed solution has been tested via extensive Monte Carlo simulations, as well as via experiments on a real UR10 robot.	https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9284446	no
Cooperative Intelligent Transport Systems: Choreography-Based Urban Traffic Coordination	With the emerging connected automated vehicles, 5G and Internet of Things (IoT), vehicles and road infrastructure become connected and cooperative, enabling Cooperative Intelligent Transport Systems (C-ITS). C-ITS are transport system of systems that involves many stakeholders from different sectors. While running their own systems and providing services independently, stakeholders cooperate with each other for improving the overall transport performance such as safety, efficiency and sustainability. Massive information on road and traffic is already available and provided through standard services with different protocols. By reusing and composing the available heterogeneous services, novel value-added applications can be developed. This paper introduces a choreography-based service composition platform, i.e. the CHOReVOLUTION Integrated Development and Runtime Environment (IDRE), and it reports on how the IDRE has been successfully exploited to accelerate the reuse-based development of a choreography-based Urban Traffic Coordination (UTC) application. The UTC application takes the shape of eco-driving services that through real-time eco-route evaluation assist the drivers for the most eco-friendly and comfortable driving experience. The eco-driving services are realized through choreography and they are exploited through a mobile app for online navigation. From specification to deployment to execution, the CHOReVOLUTION IDRE has been exploited to support the realization of the UTC application by automatizing the generation of the distributed logic to properly bind, coordinate and adapt the interactions of the involved parties. The benefits brought by CHOReVOLUTION IDRE have been assessed through the evaluation of a set of Key Performance Indicators (KPIs).	https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9363009	no
Dynamic Discrete Pigeon-Inspired Optimization for Multi-UAV Cooperative Search-Attack Mission Planning	For multiple unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) performing aerial search-attack tasks, there is a tradeoff between maximizing total benefit and minimizing consumption under the validity of constraints. This article proposes a dynamic discrete pigeon-inspired optimization algorithm to handle cooperative search-attack mission planning for UAVs, which integrates the centralized task assignment and distributed path generation aspects of the problem. Besides, a solution acceptance strategy is proposed to avoid frequent task switching. To design a reasonable objective function, the probability map is constructed and updated by Bayes formula to guide the following search motion, and a response threshold sigmoid model is adopted for target allocation during executing attack. Moreover, the flyable trajectories are generated by B-spline curves based on the simplified waypoints. Finally, numerical experiments prove that the proposed methods can provide feasible solutions for multiple UAVs considering different scenarios, such as the absence or presence of threats and insufficient resources. The results also show that the solution acceptance strategy is effective to improve performance. Moreover, the extensible mission planning system also integrates with an interactive 3D visualization simulation module, where the multi-UAV coordinated flight processes are demonstrated dynamically.	https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9217922	no
An Adversarial Attack Based on Incremental Learning Techniques for Unmanned in 6G Scenes	With the development of artificial intelligence(AI), unmanned vehicles can relieve traffic jamming and decrease the risk of traffic accidents, where deep neural networks (DNNs) play an important role and have become one of the most critical technologies. Nevertheless, DNNs are still susceptible to adversarial examples. Even worse, they also show severe performance degradation when the system needs DNNs to learn new knowledge without forgetting the old one. As unmanned vehicles travel on the road, they need to frequently learn new categories and different representations. Learning all data after the new sample arrives will expend a lot of time and space. As a result, it will affect the deployment of artificial intelligence in unmanned scenes. In recent years, it has been observed that incremental learning technology can solve the above challenges. However, previously reported works mainly focused on batch learning. It is not clear how much impact the adversarial attack will have on the deep learning model when performing incremental learning tasks. This issue exposes the hidden safety risks of unmanned driving and increases discuss opportunities. Therefore, we propose an adversarial attack based on incremental learning techniques for unmanned scenes in this paper. Specifically, it can retain information previously learned by the model. At the same time, it can renew the old model to learn new model, thereby continually adding small perturbation to legitimate examples. A couple of experiments on the Pascal VOC 2012 dataset has been conducted, and the experiment results show that the adversarial attack based on incremental learning techniques has a higher attack success rate. Further, it can improve the successful attack rate by 8.43%.	https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9390408	no
Singularity-Free Guiding Vector Field for Robot Navigation	In robot navigation tasks, such as unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) highway traffic monitoring, it is important for a mobile robot to follow a specified desired path. However, most of the existing path-following navigation algorithms cannot guarantee global convergence to desired paths or enable following self-intersected desired paths due to the existence of singular points where navigation algorithms return unreliable or even no solutions. One typical example arises in vector-field guided path-following (VF-PF) navigation algorithms. These algorithms are based on a vector field, and the singular points are exactly where the vector field diminishes. Conventional VF-PF algorithms generate a vector field of the same dimensions as those of the space where the desired path lives. In this article, we show that it is mathematically impossible for conventional VF-PF algorithms to achieve global convergence to desired paths that are self-intersected or even just simple closed (precisely, homeomorphic to the unit circle). Motivated by this new impossibility result, we propose a novel method to transform self-intersected or simple closed desired paths to nonself-intersected and unbounded (precisely, homeomorphic to the real line) counterparts in a higher dimensional space. Corresponding to this new desired path, we construct a singularity-free guiding vector field on a higher dimensional space. The integral curves of this new guiding vector field is thus exploited to enable global convergence to the higher dimensional desired path, and therefore the projection of the integral curves on a lower dimensional subspace converge to the physical (lower dimensional) desired path. Rigorous theoretical analysis is carried out for the theoretical results using dynamical systems theory. In addition, we show both by theoretical analysis and numerical simulations that our proposed method is an extension combining conventional VF-PF algorithms and trajectory tracking algorithms. Finally, to show the practical value of our proposed approach for complex engineering systems, we conduct outdoor experiments with a fixed-wing airplane in windy environment to follow both 2-D and 3-D desired paths.	https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9312173	no
Systematic Assessment of Cyber-Physical Security of Energy Management System for Connected and Automated Electric Vehicles	In this article, a systematic assessment of cyber-physical security on the energy management system for connected and automated electric vehicles is proposed, which, to our knowledge, has not been attempted before. The generalized methodology of impact analysis of cyber attacks is developed, including novel evaluation metrics from the perspectives of steady state and transient performance of the energy management system and innovative index-based resilience and security criteria. Specifically, we propose a security criterion in terms of dynamic performance, comfortability, and energy, which are the most critical metrics to evaluate the performance of an electronic control unit (ECU). If an attack does not impact these metrics, it perhaps can be negligible. Based on the statistical results and the proposed evaluation metrics, the impact of cyber attacks on ECU is analyzed comprehensively. The conclusions can serve as guidelines for attack detection, diagnosis, and countermeasures.	https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9147009	no
A Secure Adaptive Control for Cooperative Driving of Autonomous Connected Vehicles in the Presence of Heterogeneous Communication Delays and Cyberattacks	The development of autonomous connected vehicles, moving as a platoon formation, is a hot topic in the intelligent transportation system (ITS) research field. It is on the road and deployment requires the design of distributed control strategies, leveraging secure vehicular ad-hoc networks (VANETs). Indeed, wireless communication networks can be affected by various security vulnerabilities and cyberattacks leading to dangerous implications for cooperative driving safety. Control design can play an important role in providing both resilience and robustness to vehicular networks. To this aim, in this article, we tackle and solve the problem of cyber-secure tracking for a platoon that moves as a cohesive formation along a single lane undergoing different kinds of cyber threats, that is, application layer and network layer attacks, as well as network induced phenomena. The proposed cooperative approach leverages an adaptive synchronization-based control algorithm that embeds a distributed mitigation mechanism of malicious information. The closed-loop stability is analytically demonstrated by using the Lyapunov-Krasovskii theory, while its effectiveness in coping with the most relevant type of cyber threats is disclosed by using PLEXE, a high fidelity simulator which provides a realistic simulation of cooperative driving systems.	https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8967210	no
Vehicle Position Correction: A Vehicular Blockchain Networks-Based GPS Error Sharing Framework	The positioning accuracy of the existing vehicular Global Positioning System (GPS) is far from sufficient to support autonomous driving and ITS applications. To remedy that, leading methods such as ranging and cooperation have improved the positioning accuracy to varying degrees, but they are still full of challenges in practical applications. Especially for cooperative positioning, in addition to the performance of methods, cooperators may provide false data due to attacks or selfishness, which can seriously affect the positioning accuracy. By fully exploiting the characteristics of blockchain and edge computing, this paper proposes a vehicular blockchain-based secure and efficient GPS positioning error evolution sharing framework, which improves vehicle positioning accuracy from ensuring security and credibility of cooperators and data. First, by analyzing the GPS error, a bridge can be established between the sensor-rich vehicles and the common vehicles to achieve cooperation by sharing the positioning error evolution at a specific time and location. Particularly, the positioning error evolution is obtained by a deep neural network (DNN)-based prediction algorithm running on the edge server. We further propose to use blockchain technology for storage and sharing the evolution of positioning errors, mainly to guarantee the security of cooperative vehicles and mobile edge computing nodes (MECNs). In addition, the corresponding smart contracts are designed to automate and efficiently perform storage and sharing tasks as well as solve inconsistencies in time scales. Extensive simulations based on actual data indicate the accuracy and security of our proposal in terms of positioning error correction and data sharing.	https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8949737	no
Task-Oriented Deep Reinforcement Learning for Robotic Skill Acquisition and Control	Reinforcement learning (RL) and imitation learning (IL), especially equipped with deep neural networks, have been widely studied for autonomous robotic skill acquisition and control tasks. However, these methods and their extensions require extensive environmental interactions during training, which greatly prevents them from being applied to real-world robots. To alleviate this problem, we present an efficient model-free off-policy actor-critic algorithm for robotic skill acquisition and continuous control, by fusing the task reward with a task-oriented guiding reward, which is formulated by leveraging few and imperfect expert demonstrations. In this framework, the agent can explore the environment more intentionally, thus sampling efficiency can be achieved; moreover, the agent can also exploit the experience more effectively, thereby substantially improved performance can be realized simultaneously. The empirical results on robotic locomotion tasks show that the proposed scheme can lower sample complexity by 2-10 times in contrast with the state-of-the-art baseline deep RL (DRL) algorithms, while achieving performance better than that of the expert. Furthermore, the proposed algorithm achieves significant improvement in both sampling efficiency and asymptotic performance on tasks with sparse and delayed reward, wherein those baseline DRL algorithms struggle to make progress. This takes a substantial step forward to implement these methods to acquire skills autonomously for real robots.	https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8897016	no
Dispatch of UAVs for Urban Vehicular Networks: A Deep Reinforcement Learning Approach	Due to the dynamic nature of connectivity in terrestrial vehicular networks, it is of great benefit to deploy unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) in these networks to act as relays. As a result, a remarkable number of studies have exploited UAVs to bridge the communication gaps between terrestrial vehicles, and sometimes despite their unoptimized mobility, their restricted communication coverage, and their limited energy resources. However, it was noted that for an intermittently connected vehicular network, UAVs could not cover all sparse areas all the time. Even worse, when deploying enough UAVs to cover all these areas, the probability of inter-UAV collisions increases, and it will be complex to control their movements efficiently. Consequently, it is required to dispatch an organized and intelligent group of UAVs to perform communication relays in the long term while keeping their connectivity, minimizing their average energy consumption, and providing an efficient coverage strategy. To meet these requirements, we propose a deep reinforcement learning (DRL) framework, called DISCOUNT (Dispatch of UAVs for Urban VANETs). Extensive simulations have been conducted to evaluate the performance of the proposed framework. It has been shown that the proposed framework significantly outperforms two commonly-used baseline techniques and some reinforcement learning methods in terms of energy consumption, coverage, and routing performances.	https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9566766	no
Multitask GANs for Semantic Segmentation and Depth Completion With Cycle Consistency	Semantic segmentation and depth completion are two challenging tasks in scene understanding, and they are widely used in robotics and autonomous driving. Although several studies have been proposed to jointly train these two tasks using some small modifications, such as changing the last layer, the result of one task is not utilized to improve the performance of the other one despite that there are some similarities between these two tasks. In this article, we propose multitask generative adversarial networks (Multitask GANs), which are not only competent in semantic segmentation and depth completion but also improve the accuracy of depth completion through generated semantic images. In addition, we improve the details of generated semantic images based on CycleGAN by introducing multiscale spatial pooling blocks and the structural similarity reconstruction loss. Furthermore, considering the inner consistency between semantic and geometric structures, we develop a semantic-guided smoothness loss to improve depth completion results. Extensive experiments on the Cityscapes data set and the KITTI depth completion benchmark show that the Multitask GANs are capable of achieving competitive performance for both semantic segmentation and depth completion tasks.	https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9429178	no
Intelligent Traffic Network Control in the Era of Internet of Vehicles	In the era of internet of vehicles, both the traffic signal control and the rerouting of connected and autonomous vehicles (CAVs) are essential techniques to alleviate traffic congestion and improve traffic efficiency. However, these two schemes have been treated separately without a unified framework allowing for joint optimization in the previous studies. In the case of traffic congestion at the bottleneck intersections, either of the two schemes alone is not enough. To this end, we propose to jointly control the traffic lights and the CAVs under the reinforcement learning (RL) framework. To lower the dimensionality of this learning problem, we propose to control the route choices of the CAVs through a few common scalar parameters instead of controlling the CAVs individually. In particular, the rerouting ratios are dynamically adjusted. A model-based method is further proposed to estimate the expected travel time with reduced estimation error. We then exploit the tools from deep RL and put forth an efficient algorithm that is able to control the green time allocation of traffic signals and the rerouting of CAVs jointly. Comprehensive numerical experiments demonstrate the validity of our proposed models and show the traffic efficiency can be significantly improved with our proposed algorithm.	https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9516945	no
End-to-End Autonomous Driving Risk Analysis: A Behavioural Anomaly Detection Approach	Autonomous vehicles (AV) have advanced considerably over the past decade and their potential to reduce road accidents is without equal. That said, the evolution towards fully automated driving will be accompanied by new and unfamiliar risks. The deployment of AVs hinges on the premise that they are considerably safer than human drivers. However, the ability of manufacturers, insurers and regulators to quantifiably demonstrate this risk reduction, relative to humans, presents a major barrier. Based on accident rates, it will likely take hundreds of millions of autonomous miles to derive statistically meaningful results. This paper addresses this issue and proposes a novel means of quantifying AV accident risks by benchmarking against a more familiar and quantifiable risk - Human Behaviour. This method is used to proactively quantify AV safety relative to human drivers. Currently, anomalous driving behaviour stems from human susceptibilities such as fatigue or aggression. We exploit this observation and explore AV driving behaviour where driving anomalies are symptoms of technology errors. The comparative behaviours of AV and safe human driving can be used to measure AV accident risk. An end-to-end model AV is simulated using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) to compare human and AV driving behaviours. Using a machine learning technique called Gaussian Processes (GP), contextual driving anomalies are detected, the frequency and severity of which are used to derive a risk score. This paper offers a starting point for addressing the challenges surrounding AV risk modelling.	https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9154760	no
Multiobjective Overtaking Maneuver Planning for Autonomous Ground Vehicles	Constrained autonomous vehicle overtaking trajectories are usually difficult to generate due to certain practical requirements and complex environmental limitations. This problem becomes more challenging when multiple contradicting objectives are required to be optimized and the on-road objects to be overtaken are irregularly placed. In this article, a novel swarm intelligence-based algorithm is proposed for producing the multiobjective optimal overtaking trajectory of autonomous ground vehicles. The proposed method solves a multiobjective optimal control model in order to optimize the maneuver time duration, the trajectory smoothness, and the vehicle visibility, while taking into account different types of mission-dependent constraints. However, one problem that could have an impact on the optimization process is the selection of algorithm control parameters. To desensitize the negative influence, a novel fuzzy adaptive strategy is proposed and embedded in the algorithm framework. This allows the optimization process to dynamically balance the local exploitation and global exploration, thereby exploring the tradeoff between objectives more effectively. The performance of using the designed fuzzy adaptive multiobjective method is analyzed and validated by executing a number of simulation studies. The results confirm the effectiveness of applying the proposed algorithm to produce multiobjective optimal overtaking trajectories for autonomous ground vehicles. Moreover, the comparison to other state-of-the-art multiobjective optimization schemes shows that the designed strategy tends to be more capable in terms of producing a set of widespread and high-quality Pareto-optimal solutions.	https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9025756	no
Morphing Attack Detection-Database, Evaluation Platform, and Benchmarking	Morphing attacks have posed a severe threat to Face Recognition System (FRS). Despite the number of advancements reported in recent works, we note serious open issues such as independent benchmarking, generalizability challenges and considerations to age, gender, ethnicity that are inadequately addressed. Morphing Attack Detection (MAD) algorithms often are prone to generalization challenges as they are database dependent. The existing databases, mostly of semi-public nature, lack in diversity in terms of ethnicity, various morphing process and post-processing pipelines. Further, they do not reflect a realistic operational scenario for Automated Border Control (ABC) and do not provide a basis to test MAD on unseen data, in order to benchmark the robustness of algorithms. In this work, we present a new sequestered dataset for facilitating the advancements of MAD where the algorithms can be tested on unseen data in an effort to better generalize. The newly constructed dataset consists of facial images from 150 subjects from various ethnicities, age-groups and both genders. In order to challenge the existing MAD algorithms, the morphed images are with careful subject pre-selection created from the contributing images, and further post-processed to remove morphing artifacts. The images are also printed and scanned to remove all digital cues and to simulate a realistic challenge for MAD algorithms. Further, we present a new online evaluation platform to test algorithms on sequestered data. With the platform we can benchmark the morph detection performance and study the generalization ability. This work also presents a detailed analysis on various subsets of sequestered data and outlines open challenges for future directions in MAD research.	https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9246583	no
Prediction of Motion Simulator Signals Using Time-Series Neural Networks	A motion cueing algorithm (MCA) is employed to transform the linear and angular motion signals generated from a motion simulator without violating the physical and dynamical boundaries of the motion platform. In this respect, the accurate prediction of the motion scenarios is essential to enhance the efficiency of the MCA using prepositioning or time-varying reference model predictive control. While a recent approach that utilizes a feedforward neural network (NN) to forecast the motion scenarios is useful, the feedforward NN model has only forward dynamics relating to the signals without any feedback loop. In this article, a time-delay feedforward NN, a recurrent NN, and a nonlinear autoregressive (NAR) models with three different training procedures, i.e., Levenberg–Marquardt, Bayesian regularization, and scaled conjugate gradient, are exploited to predict the motion scenarios. As the NAR model employs the historical signals as the inputs, it can predict the motion scenarios with higher accuracy rates. Based on the series of empirical evaluations, NAR trained with Levenberg–Marquardt is able to outperform the other two counterparts in producing more accurate predictions of the motion signals. The NAR method has a lower computational load as compared with that of the recurrent NN, facilitating its real-time application. In addition to the MCA, the NAR method can be employed in other areas, including autonomous vehicles and motion sickness studies. It can also be easily implemented for air, sea, and/or land vehicle simulators for training purposes in virtual reality environments.	https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9439050	no
Scenario-Based Trajectory Optimization in Uncertain Dynamic Environments	We present an optimization-based method to plan the motion of an autonomous robot under the uncertainties associated with dynamic obstacles, such as humans. Our method bounds the marginal risk of collisions at each point in time by incorporating chance constraints into the planning problem. This problem is not suitable for online optimization outright for arbitrary probability distributions. Hence, we sample from these chance constraints using an uncertainty model, to generate “scenarios,” which translate the probabilistic constraints into deterministic ones. In practice, each scenario represents the collision constraint for a dynamic obstacle at the location of the sample. The number of theoretically required scenarios can be very large. Nevertheless, by exploiting the geometry of the workspace, we show how to prune most scenarios before optimization and we demonstrate how the reduced scenarios can still provide probabilistic guarantees on the safety of the motion plan. Since our approach is scenario based, we are able to handle arbitrary uncertainty distributions. We apply our method in a Model Predictive Contouring Control framework and demonstrate its benefits in simulations and experiments with a moving robot platform navigating among pedestrians, running in real-time.	https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9410362	no
Event-Based Resilient Formation Control of Multiagent Systems	This paper focuses on the time-varying formation tracking issue for nonlinear multiagent systems (MASs). Based on the explicit characterizations of frequency, duration, and magnitude properties for deception attacks, a hybrid framework is proposed for time-varying formation tracking of nonlinear MASs. To realize the desired formation tracking performance under deception attacks, the distributed edge-based event-triggered communication strategies are proposed with Zeno-freeness. The designed strategies are resilient to deception attacks under some appropriate assumptions, to realize a predefined formation and simultaneously track the convex combination of leaders' states. The designed control strategies render that we do not need to detect when the deception attack happens. Furthermore, the obtained results can be deduced to deal with consensus/synchronization problems, target enclosing problems for MASs with one/multiple leaders, where the communication is attacked by malicious attackers. An example of time-varying formation tracking of unmanned aerial vehicles is provided to show the effectiveness of the obtained results.	https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8700273	no
Tightly Coupled Inertial Navigation System With Signals of Opportunity Aiding	A tightly coupled inertial navigation system (INS) aided by ambient signals of opportunity (SOPs) is developed. In this system, a navigating vehicle aids its onboard INS using pseudoranges drawn from terrestrial SOPs with unknown emitter positions and clock biases through an extended Kalman filter-based radio simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM) framework. The SOP-aided INS uses both global navigation satellite system (GNSS) and SOP pseudoranges during GNSS availability periods and switches to using SOP pseudoranges exclusively during GNSS unavailability periods. This framework is studied through numerical simulations by varying: 1) Quantity of exploited SOPs and 2) quality of SOP-equipped oscillators. It is demonstrated that the SOP-aided INS using a consumer-grade IMU produces smaller estimation uncertainties compared to a traditional tightly coupled GNSS-aided INS using a tactical-grade IMU. In the absence of GNSS signals, over the simulation finite-time horizon, the errors produced by the SOP-aided INS appear to be bounded, while the errors produced by a traditional tightly coupled GNSS-aided INS diverge unboundedly. Moreover, the article presents experimental results demonstrating an unmanned aerial vehicle using terrestrial cellular SOPs to aid its onboard consumer-grade IMU in the absence of GNSS signals. It is demonstrated that the final position error of a traditional tightly coupled GNSS-aided INS after 30 s of GNSS cutoff was 57.30 m, while the final position error of the tightly coupled SOP-aided INS was 9.59 m.	https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9335262	no
Adversarial Learning for Knowledge Adaptation From Multiple Remote Sensing Sources	In this work, we introduce a neural architecture to unsupervised domain from multiple source domains. This architecture uses an EfficientNet as a feature extractor coupled with a set of Softmax classifiers equal to the number of source domains followed by an opportune fusion layer. To reduce the domain discrepancy between each source and target domain, we adopt a Minmax entropy approach that is based on the idea of optimizing in an adversarial manner the conditional entropy of the target samples with respect to each source classifier and minimizes it with respect to the feature extractor. As for the fusion module, we propose a weighted average fusion layer with learnable weights for aggregating the outputs of the different Softmax classifiers. Experiments on a multisource data set composed of images acquired by manned and unmanned aerial vehicles (MAVs/UAVs) over different locations are reported and discussed.	https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9129743	no
Learning-Based Predictive Path Following Control for Nonlinear Systems Under Uncertain Disturbances	Accurate path following is challenging for autonomous robots operating in uncertain environments. Adaptive and predictive control strategies are crucial for a nonlinear robotic system to achieve high-performance path following control. In this letter, we propose a novel learning-based predictive control scheme that couples a high-level model predictive path following controller (MPFC) with a low-level learning-based feedback linearization controller (LB-FBLC) for nonlinear systems under uncertain disturbances. The low-level LB-FBLC utilizes Gaussian Processes to learn the uncertain environmental disturbances online and tracks the reference state accurately with a probabilistic stability guarantee. Meanwhile, the high-level MPFC exploits the linearized system model augmented with a virtual linear path dynamics model to optimize the evolution of path reference targets, and provides the reference states and controls for the low-level LB-FBLC. Simulation results illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed control strategy on a quadrotor path following task under unknown wind disturbances.	https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9366351	no
Integrity for Multi-Sensor Cooperative Positioning	A cooperative integrity monitoring (CIM) algorithm is proposed in this work. Under the CIM architecture, the algorithm can fully exploit the global navigation satellite system (GNSS) data and inter-vehicle measurements data to improve the detection and isolation of faulty measurements due to multipath or non line of sight (NLOS). Taking the advantages of cooperative scheme, a residual decomposition method is used to model the measurement errors into common and specific parts, a greedy search strategy is used to exclude the faulty measurements based on its sub-statistics. Simulation results show that CIM has better detection of GNSS fault than traditional receiver autonomous integrity monitoring (RAIM). Also, CIM is capable of detecting the faulty outliers in inter-vehicle measurements. The results indicate that CIM can be applied to many existing multi-sensor cooperative positioning algorithms.	https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8926518	no
Autonomous Vehicle Source Enumeration Exploiting Non-Cooperative UAV in Software Defined Internet of Vehicles	The traffic congestion and accidents can be relieved by deploying the software defined internet of vehicles (SDN-IoV). However, the traffic of pedestrians and vehicles is particularly heavy near commercial streets and campuses. In particular scenarios, the SDN-IoV may not ensure the quality of service (QoS) for pedestrians and vehicles. In this paper, we construct a novel system architecture consisting of multiple non-cooperative unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) and a SDN-IoV. The non-cooperative UAV is equipped with an antenna array to receive the signals from the vehicles and pedestrians of SDN-IoV. In order to locate the positions of vehicles and pedestrians, two source enumeration methods are proposed in a complex SDN-IoV environment with color noise. The projection matrix of the low dimensional signal subspace is constructed by the proposed criterion based on signal subspace projection (SSP). The sequence of the projected difference values of the local covariance matrix is applied to estimate the number of vehicles and pedestrians. The eigenvalues can be grouped to construct different subspaces by the proposed eigen-subspace projection (ESP). By projecting a new covariance matrix into the eigen-subspaces, the variance of values represents the projection difference can be exploited to estimate the number of vehicles and pedestrians. Simulation results and real system test verify the validity of the two proposed methods by comparing them with the state-of-the-art methods. Both of the methods have excellent estimation performance especially in color noise.	https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9204806	no
Aerial Visual Perception in Smart Farming: Field Study of Wheat Yellow Rust Monitoring	Agriculture is facing severe challenges from crop stresses, threatening its sustainable development and food security. This article exploits aerial visual perception for yellow rust disease monitoring, which seamlessly integrates state-of-the-art techniques and algorithms, including unmanned aerial vehicle sensing, multispectral imaging, vegetation segmentation, and deep learning U-Net. A field experiment is designed by infecting winter wheat with yellow rust inoculum, on top of which multispectral aerial images are captured by DJI Matrice 100 equipped with RedEdge camera. After image calibration and stitching, multispectral orthomosaic is labeled for system evaluation by inspecting high-resolution RGB images taken by Parrot Anafi Drone. The merits of the developed framework drawing spectral-spatial information concurrently are demonstrated by showing improved performance over purely spectral-based classifier by the classical random forest algorithm. Moreover, various network input band combinations are tested, including three RGB bands and five selected spectral vegetation indices, by sequential forward selection strategy of wrapper algorithm.	https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9027887	no
Multi-Source Adversarial Sample Attack on Autonomous Vehicles	Deep learning has an impressive performance of object detection and classification for autonomous vehicles. Nevertheless, the essential vulnerability of deep learning models to adversarial samples makes the autonomous vehicles suffer severe security and safety issues. Although a number of works have been proposed to study adversarial samples, only a few of them are designated for the scenario of autonomous vehicles. Moreover, the state-of-the-art attack models only focus on a single data source without considering the correlation among multiple data sources. To fill this blank, we propose two multi-source adversarial sample attack models, including the parallel attack model and the fusion attack model to simultaneously attack the image and LiDAR perception systems in the autonomous vehicles. In the parallel attack model, adversarial samples are generated from the original image and LiDAR data separately. In the fusion attack model, the adversarial samples of image and LiDAR can be generated from a low-dimension vector at the same time by fully exploring data correlation for data fusion and adversarial sample generation. Through comprehensive real-data experiments, we validate that our proposed models are more powerful and efficient to break down the perception systems of autonomous vehicles compared with the state-of-the-art. Furthermore, we simulate possible attack scenarios in Vehicular Ad hoc Networks (VANETs) to evaluate the attack performance of our proposed methods.	https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9360457	yes
Informed Autonomous Exploration of Subterranean Environments	Autonomous exploration is highly challenging in subterranean applications due to the constraints imposed by the nature of the environments (e.g., dead-end branches, unstructured regions, narrow passages and bifurcations). Robots need to constantly balance their exploration objectives with measures to ensure safety. We present an informed exploration approach to address these challenges, which exploits a reachability graph to represent the environment's structure and adaptive navigation to find collision-free motions. Our system makes the inspection task tractable and maximizes the information acquired about the environment while preserving safety. We evaluate our navigation and exploration techniques against several challenging cave scenarios reconstructed using real data. Our experimental results demonstrate that our method enables the robot to make informed decisions and perform exploration more efficiently than existing techniques in confined spaces.	https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9507290	no
Who Is in Control? Practical Physical Layer Attack and Defense for mmWave-Based Sensing in Autonomous Vehicles	With the wide bandwidths in millimeter wave (mmWave) frequency band that results in unprecedented accuracy, mmWave sensing has become vital for many applications, especially in autonomous vehicles (AVs). In addition, mmWave sensing has superior reliability compared to other sensing counterparts such as camera and LiDAR, which is essential for safety-critical driving. Therefore, it is critical to understand the security vulnerabilities and improve the security and reliability of mmWave sensing in AVs. To this end, we perform the end-to-end security analysis of a mmWave-based sensing system in AVs, by designing and implementing practical physical layer attack and defense strategies in a state-of-the-art mmWave testbed and an AV testbed in real-world settings. Various strategies are developed to take control of the victim AV by spoofing its mmWave sensing module, including adding fake obstacles at arbitrary locations and faking the locations of existing obstacles. Five real-world attack scenarios are constructed to spoof the victim AV and force it to make dangerous driving decisions leading to a fatal crash. Field experiments are conducted to study the impact of the various attack scenarios using a Lincoln MKZ-based AV testbed, which validate that the attacker can indeed assume control of the victim AV to compromise its security and safety. To defend the attacks, we design and implement a challenge-response authentication scheme and a RF fingerprinting scheme to reliably detect aforementioned spoofing attacks.	https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9417240	no
Attention Based Vehicle Trajectory Prediction	Self-driving vehicles need to continuously analyse the driving scene, understand the behavior of other road users and predict their future trajectories in order to plan a safe motion and reduce their reaction time. Motivated by this idea, this paper addresses the problem of vehicle trajectory prediction over an extended horizon. On highways, human drivers continuously adapt their speed and paths according to the behavior of their neighboring vehicles. Therefore, vehicles' trajectories are very correlated and considering vehicle interactions makes motion prediction possible even before the start of a clear maneuver pattern. To this end, we introduce and analyze trajectory prediction methods based on how they model the vehicles interactions. Inspired by human reasoning, we use an attention mechanism that explicitly highlights the importance of neighboring vehicles with respect to their future states. We go beyond pairwise vehicle interactions and model higher order interactions. Moreover, the existence of different goals and driving behaviors induces multiple potential futures. We exploit a combination of global and partial attention paid to surrounding vehicles to generate different possible trajectory. Experiments on highway datasets show that the proposed model outperforms the state-of-the-art performances.	https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9084255	no
Detecting Generalized Replay Attacks via Time-Varying Dynamic Watermarking	Cyber-physical systems (CPS) often rely on external communication for supervisory control or sensing. Unfortunately, these communications render the system vulnerable to cyber attacks. Attacks that alter messages, such as replay attacks that record measurement signals, and then play them back to the system can cause devastating effects. Dynamic Watermarking methods, which inject a private excitation into control inputs to secure resulting measurement signals, have begun addressing the challenges of detecting these attacks, but have been restricted to linear time-invariant (LTI) systems. Though LTI models are sufficient for some applications, other CPS, such as autonomous vehicles, require more complex models. This article develops a linear time-varying (LTV) extension to previous dynamic watermarking methods by designing a matrix normalization factor to accommodate the temporal changes in the system. Implementable tests are provided with considerations for real-world systems. The proposed method is then shown to be able to detect generalized replay attacks both in theory and in simulation using an LTV vehicle model.	https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9187955	no
Take the Field from Your Smartphone: Leveraging UAVs for Event Filming	This paper formulates the Sport Event Filming with Connectivity Constraints (SEF-C2) problem. The SEF-C2 problem is an event coverage problem, which exploits a team of Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) over a limited field in order to track the movements of an object (e.g., of the ball) and to deliver a video stream of the events (e.g., ball passes, goals) to the spectators meeting certain timeliness and video quality criteria. Assuming a priori knowledge of the whole sequence of actions, first a novel mathematical model is introduced that determines a sequence of movements for the UAVs, such that the timeliness of the filming is maximized and the total traveled distance is minimized. Then, dynamic, artificial potential function based, distributed UAV movement schemes that have no a priori knowledge of the sequence of game actions are proposed to optimize networking performance. Extensive simulations are used to analyze the performance in terms of video transmission quality and show that the proposed schemes outperform existing schemes.	https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8716586	no
A Secure Shuffling Mechanism for White-Box Attack-Resistant Unmanned Vehicles	Unmanned Vehicles (UVs) have been being utilized for various applications, such as surveillance, search/rescue, and monitoring. The information they transmit is critical for decision-making. However, UVs are vulnerable to white-box attacks due to improvements in reverse engineering techniques and the openness of their software. Therefore, attackers with sufficient knowledge of a target UV can steal secret information stored in the UV by exploiting its vulnerabilities. Recently, several white-box cryptography techniques have been introduced to protect secret keys from being extracted by converting them into large look-up tables. However, none of them provide approaches to securely update the look-up tables. Thus, once a remote attacker succeeds in extracting the static look-up table from a UV, he/she can use it to decrypt past/future communications or to send false information to the control station by impersonating the UV. In this paper, we propose a look-up table shuffling mechanism that supports white-box cryptography with dynamics. The mechanism makes it hard for attackers to determine the positions of the table entries, and thus to decrypt/encrypt ciphertexts/plaintexts. To show the practicality of the block cipher with our mechanism, we implemented it on a board equipped with a GPU and show its GPU-accelerated performance.	https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8658144	no

Event-Based Intermittent Formation Control of Multi-UAV Systems Under Deception Attacks	This article investigates the problem of event-based intermittent formation control for multi-UAV systems subject to deception attacks. Compared to the available research studies on multi-UAV systems with continuous control strategy, the proposed intermittent control strategy saves a large amount of computation resources. An average method is introduced in developing the event-triggered mechanism (ETM) such that the amount of unexpected triggering events induced by uncertain disturbances is greatly reduced. Moreover, such a mechanism can further decrease the average data-releasing rate, thereby alleviating the burden of network bandwidth. Sufficient conditions for multi-UAV systems with deception attacks to achieve the predefined formation are obtained with the aid of Lyapunov stability theory. Finally, the validity of the proposed theoretical results is demonstrated via a simulation example. IEEE	https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85144812179&origin=inward	no

AERO: Automotive Ethernet Real-Time Observer for Anomaly Detection in In-Vehicle Networks	Automotive Ethernet enables high-bandwidth in-vehicle networking, facilitating the transmission of sensor data among electronic control units. However, the increasing connectivity and potential vulnerability inheritance in connected and autonomous vehicles expose them to security risks. To address this challenge, an intrusion detection system (IDS) capable of analyzing automotive Ethernet traffic and detecting anomalies is essential. In thisarticle, we propose automotive Ethernet real-time observer (AERO), an unsupervised network IDS designed to protect in-vehicle networks. AERO consists of three components: a feature extractor that constructs three multimodal features, a neural network for processing the extracted features, and an online anomaly detector that calculates outlier scores in real time. We evaluate the performance of AERO using the TOW-IDS automotive Ethernet intrusion dataset. The experimental results demonstrate that AERO achieves high detection performance across five different attack types and is highly applicable to automotive-grade devices for real-time anomaly detection.

Transferability of Adversarial Attacks on Tiny Deep Learning Models for IoT Unmanned Aerial Vehicles	In the realm of miniature machine learning for Internet of Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs), the security concerns of machine learning models are obvious, especially when it comes to adversarial attacks. Models can become confused and their performance undermined by the introduction of meticulously crafted distortions. These attacks can even infiltrate a variety of models, bringing greater security risks. To understand how it works and mitigate its effects, our research focuses on scrutinizing the transferability of adversarial attacks in the expanding context of miniature machine learning for UAVs. In this paper, we introduce a formula help measure the transferability of adversarial attacks and explore ways to improve the transferability and effectiveness of adversarial attacks (e.g., a combination of attack techniques), and provide visulizations to vividly illustrate the repercussions of adversarial instances across a spectrum of attack intensities, helping facilitate more intuitive exploration and analysis of the results. For instance, our findings demonstrate that even subtle perturbations directed at specific attributes can lead to a significant decrease in model accuracy. We also evaluates the success rates of various attack algorithms and validates the proposed evaluation methodology for measuring transferability. And the outcomes unveiled in this study make noteworthy strides in fostering a profound comprehension of the transferability of adversarial attacks in the distinct realm of miniature machine learning for UAVs. Robust defense mechanisms, which ensure the impregnability of IoT-enabled UAV systems, can be cultivated by pinpointing the most efficacious attack strategies and evaluating their transferability.

UAV-taken Wind Turbine Image Dehazing with a Double-patch Lightweight Neural Network	Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) offer a solution for remote inspection of wind turbines. However, in stormy weather conditions, the visual quality of UAV-taken images is affected by contaminated suspended atmospheric particles. To address this problem, a double-patch lightweight convolutional dehazing neural network (DPLDN) is proposed to reconstruct hazy images and enhance the image quality. Unlike other learning-based methods that measure transmission map and atmospheric light separately, the proposed DPLDN uses a transformed atmospheric scattering model to jointly transmission map and atmospheric light, employs depth-separable convolution instead of conventional convolution, and splits the image into double patches. In addition, a super-resolution reconstruction method is proposed to transform the processed low-resolution images into higher-quality images. Extensive experiments shows that our proposed method has better dehazing performance compared to other state-of-the-art image dehazing techniques. Meanwhile, the applicability of the method in wind turbine blade image segmentation is experimentally verified.

3D UAV Small Cell Base Station Positioning and Resource Allocation in Cellular Network: A Stochastic Optimization Approach	Integrating Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) into wireless communication as aerial platforms to mount small cell base stations has grown rapidly in recent years. One of the main objectives of UAV integration into wireless networks is to optimize UAV deployment while meeting user expectations with the fewest UAVs. To ensure that users receive the requested data rate, management of UAV placement and user association is necessary due to the limited capacity of aerial base stations. Besides the user-base station distance, environmental conditions and propagation mode affect the data rate received by the users. When accounting for uncertain conditions, network management decisions become more realistic and productive. This paper considers a random propagation mode for each link depending on the environmental conditions of the desired area. We exploit the stochastic programming framework to reflect propagation mode uncertainty in the optimization problem, which impacts the received data rate and path loss. The suggested mathematical formulation determines the minimum number of required UAVs, their 3D positions, and the best user association strategy. The proposed model also includes interference-aware constraints for optimal radio resource allocation to base stations. The nonlinear path loss and LoS probability distribution functions in terms of the base station positions lead to a non-linear formulation. We obtain a mixed-binary linear formulation by replacing non-linear functions with their piecewise linear approximations and solve the model accurately using the CPLEX solver. The implementation results show that stochastic approaches provide more accurate diagnoses of the environment, as well as superior performance to deterministic optimization.

Leveraging Digital Twin and DRL for Collaborative Context Offloading in C-V2X Autonomous Driving	Digital Twin (DT) technology, as a promising technology, can achieve the vehicular contexts mapping of the virtual world and physical world in a collaborative autonomous driving (CAD) system. DT technology is developed on the basis of C-V2X, 6G, Mobile Edge Computing (MEC), Machine Learning (ML) and other technologies, which can enable the creation of robust and reliable digital twin-based collaborative autonomous driving architectures, providing a platform for testing, validating, and refining autonomous driving systems in a highly efficient and safe manner. However, the future large-scale CAD system needs greater real-time processing and resource collaboration capability for autonomous vehicles (AVs). Especially considering the mobility of AVs, it puts higher demands on the management of AVs. In this paper, we present a digital twin (DT)-based collaborative autonomous driving (DTCAD) three-layer architecture in C-V2X to provide better resource management of AVs. In order to improve the Quality of Service (QoS) and reduce the processing latency in large-scale CAD scenarios, a scalable Deep Reinforcement Learning and Mean Field Game method (DDPG-MFG) are proposed, where the dynamic and real-time interaction between AVs is approximated as a mean-field gaming process in DT resource allocation. Especially, to improve the interaction efficiency between AVs and CAD environment, we design more efficient exploitation and exploration algorithms for AVs. The CARLA simulation demonstrates our proposed algorithm significantly reduces the task offloading latency, and improves the average rewards by 28.5%, 3.5%, and 6.8%, compared with traditional DDPG, TD3, and AC, respectively.

On the Physical Layer Security of Automotive Dual-Function Radar-Communication Systems	The automotive industry has witnessed flourishing development in the last few years with the hope of achieving fully autonomous driving. In parallel, dual-function radar-communication (DFRC) systems are being developed to tackle the spectrum scarcity challenge and integrate radar and communication transceivers into a unified system. However, with a DFRC system, critical information may be intercepted by unauthorized people in the target vehicle. Therefore, the physical layer security of the DFRC system needs to be given considerable attention. To improve the security of information transmission, artificial noise (AN) is used to interfere with eavesdroppers. The main objective of this work is to maximize the secrecy rate of vehicles subject to both radar signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR) and communication transmit power constraints. To overcome the difficulty caused by the existence of the nonconvex Shannon capacity formula in the formulated problem, we convert the secrecy rate optimization to an equivalent bi-convex optimization problem. Furthermore, due to the nonconvexity of the formulated design problem, we exploit an inexact block coordinate descent (IBCD) algorithm based on semi-definite Programming (SDP) to obtain the optimal solution. Moreover, to reduce the complexity of the SDP-based IBCD algorithm, a bi-search-based IBCD algorithm is employed for single target scenarios. Finally, numerical simulations are used to demonstrate the superiority of using the AN approach to enhance the performance of the DFRC system in terms of the secrecy rate.	https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=10206037	no
Outage Performance of Multitier UAV Communication With Random Beam Misalignment	By exploiting the degree of freedom on the altitude, unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) communication can provide ubiquitous communication for future wireless networks. In the case of concurrent transmission of multiple UAVs, the directional beamforming formed by multiple antennas is an effective way to reduce co-channel interference. However, factors, such as airflow disturbance or estimation error for UAV communications, can cause the occurrence of beam misalignment. In this article, we investigate the system performance of a multitier UAV communication network with the consideration of unstable beam alignment. In particular, we propose a tractable random model to capture the impacts of beam misalignment in the 3-D space. Based on this, by utilizing stochastic geometry, an analytical framework for obtaining the outage probability in the downlink of a multitier UAV communication network for the closest distance association scheme and the maximum average power association scheme is established. The accuracy of the analysis is verified by Monte Carlo simulations. The results indicate that in the presence of random beam misalignment, the optimal number of UAV antennas needs to be adjusted to be relatively larger when the density of UAVs increases or the altitude of UAVs becomes higher.	https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=10195979	no
Anchor-Free Multi-UAV Detection and Classification Using Spectrogram	The advancements in unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) technology have brought immense convenience to society. However, unauthorized UAVs pose a serious threat to personal privacy, public safety, and aviation security. Therefore, accurate UAV detection and classification are crucial. Moreover, with the increased popularity of UAVs, the likelihood of multiple UAVs appearing in the same area simultaneously has also dramatically increased. Recent studies demonstrate that object detectors, such as FasterRCNN and YOLO, can be used to detect and classify multiple UAVs based on spectrograms. To our best knowledge, the object detectors are directly used to classify UAV without considering the characteristics of the UAV signal spectrogram, which results in a decrease in recognition performance. In this article, we analyze the characteristics of the UAV signal spectrogram in detail and conclude two problems, i.e., prior anchor mismatch and cross-domain detection, hindering the implementation of object detector for UAV recognition. To solve prior anchor mismatch, we propose an anchor-free detector based on keypoint and design a novel keypoints matching algorithm to improve recognition performance. To solve cross-domain detection, we propose an adversarial learning-based data adaptation method, which can generate domain-independent and domain-aligned features. Finally, the experiments adopt practical spectrogram and synthetic spectrogram to verify the superiority of the proposed anchor-free detector and the effectiveness of the proposed data adaptation method.	https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=10221859	no
Agricultural UAV trajectory planning by incorporating multi-mechanism improved grey wolf optimization algorithm	Unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) trajectory planning plays an essential role in agricultural production and biological control. To solve the agricultural UAV trajectory planning problem, a multi-mechanism collaborative improved grey wolf optimization algorithm (NAS-GWO) is proposed. In NAS-GWO, the evolutionary boundary constraint processing mechanism is introduced to update the position of the grey wolf individuals that cross the boundary in time to retain the position information of the optimal individuals to the largest degree to enhance the search accuracy of the algorithm. Then, the Gaussian mutation strategy and spiral function are used as perturbation mechanisms to help the algorithm jump out of the local optimum in time to strengthen the exploitation capability of NAS-GWO. Meanwhile, the improved Sigmoid function is used as a nonlinear convergence factor for balancing the exploitation and exploration of the NAS-GWO. By comparing NAS-GWO with ten advanced metaheuristic algorithms on 20 CEC2017 benchmark functions, the experimental results show that the NAS-GWO algorithm has superior merit seeking and robustness. Moreover, the agricultural UAV trajectory planning problem is solved using NAS-GWO. The experimental results show that the NAS-GWO algorithm plans a more viable and stable trajectory path in four different scale missions, while the most important is that it requires less cost. Among them, the algorithm reduces 27.93%, 38.15%, 32.32%, 34.11%, 10.63%, and 13.48% on average in cost function values compared to Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO), Whale Optimization Algorithm (WOA), Aquila Optimizer (AO), Differential Evolution (DE), Dung Beetle Optimizer (DBO), and Grey Wolf Optimization algorithm (GWO), thus proving the effectiveness and significance of NAS-GWO in the agricultural UAV trajectory path planning problem.

Robust Perception Under Adverse Conditions for Autonomous Driving Based on Data Augmentation	Many existing advanced deep learning-based autonomous systems have recently been used for autonomous vehicles. In general, a deep learning-based visual perception system heavily relies on visual perception to recognize and localize dynamic interest objects (e.g., pedestrians and cars) and indicative traffic signs and lights to assist autonomous vehicles in maneuvering safely. However, the performance of existing object recognition algorithms could degrade significantly under some adverse and challenging scenarios including rainy, foggy, and rainy night conditions. The raindrops, light reflection, and low illumination pose a great challenge to robust object recognition. Thus, A robust and accurate autonomous driving system has attracted growing attention from the computer vision community. To achieve robust and accurate visual perception, we target to build effective and efficient augmentation and fusion techniques based on visual perception under various adverse conditions. The unpaired image-to-image (I2I) synthesis is integrated for visual perception enhancement and effective synthesis-based augmentation. Besides, we design a two-branch architecture to utilize the information from both the original image and the enhanced image synthesized by I2I. We comprehensively and hierarchically investigate the performance improvement and limitation of the proposed system based on visual recognition tasks and network backbones. An extensive experimental analysis of various adverse weather conditions is also included. The experimental results have demonstrated the proposed system could promote the ability of autonomous vehicles for robust and accurate perception under adverse weather conditions.

Design and flight test of the fixed-flapping hybrid morphing wing aerial vehicle	Bionic aircrafts have become a hot topic in the research on unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs). By mimicking the flight mechanics and wing morphology of living organisms, bionic aircraft not only improve aerodynamic performance, stealth, and convenience but also enable single aircraft to complete multiple specific tasks. To further improve the practical performance of bionic aircraft, a fixed-flapping hybrid morphing wing aerial vehicle (F-FWAV) is designed, and the aerodynamic and flight mechanics are studied. First, kinematic simulations are conducted on the designed F-FWAV, and the kinematic characteristics of the flapping wing are analyzed. Then, flight tests are conducted on the aircraft model, and time-domain and frequency-domain analyses were performed on the data of the pitch angle and roll angle during level flight, high angle of attack (AOA) maneuvering and landing, indicating that the pitch and roll angles of the F-FWAV are coupled. CFD numerical simulations are used to obtain the cruise points of the F-FWAV under different AOAs, frequencies, and freestream velocities. The results of the mutual interference between the fixed wing and flapping wing sections show that the flapping wing section provides more than 50 % of the lift of the entire flight process, and the downward flapping movement of the flapping wing section increases the edge vortex of the fixed wing section, thereby increasing the lift of the fixed wing section.

Aerobatic Trajectory Generation for a VTOL Fixed-Wing Aircraft Using Differential Flatness	This article proposes a novel algorithm for aerobatic trajectory generation for a vertical take-off and landing (VTOL) tailsitter flying wing aircraft. The algorithm differs from existing approaches for fixed-wing trajectory generation, as it considers a realistic six-degree-of-freedom (6-DOF) flight dynamics model, including aerodynamic equations. Using a global dynamics model enables the generation of aerobatics trajectories that exploit the entire flight envelope, allowing agile maneuvering through the stall regime, sideways uncoordinated flight, inverted flight, etc. The method uses the differential flatness property of the global tailsitter flying wing dynamics, which is derived in this work. By performing snap minimization in the differentially flat output space, a computationally efficient algorithm, suitable for online motion planning, is obtained. The algorithm is demonstrated in extensive flight experiments encompassing six aerobatic maneuvers, a time-optimal drone racing trajectory, and an airshowlike aerobatic sequence for three tailsitter aircraft.

Acoustic Stall Detection of Variable Pitch Propeller for Unmanned Aerial Vehicles	This paper presents an analysis of acoustic emission and performance data of a UAV rotor equipped with a variable pitch propeller. The proposed study aims to show propeller noise features that indicate stall flow regime on the blade. Analysis of the noise characteristics around the propeller in terms of power spectral density allow to detect the stall. The study shows that a microphone located at different angles around the propeller can provide data sufficient to determine if the blade angle of attack has forced the propeller into the stall regime. In this range, the propeller’s efficiency in hover decreases and leads to an increase in power consumption. The reresearch is a suggests a method of data treatment to obtain a single parameter indicating a blade stall.	https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85176506665&origin=inward    https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007/s10846-023-01997-x.pdf	no

Shared-Control Teleoperation Paradigms on a Soft-Growing Robot Manipulator	Semi-autonomous telerobotic systems allow both humans and robots to exploit their strengths while enabling personalized execution of a remote task. For soft robots with kinematic structures dissimilar to those of human operators, it is unknown how the allocation of control between the human and the robot changes the performance. This work presents a set of interaction paradigms between a human and a remote soft-growing robot manipulator, with demonstrations in both real and simulated scenarios. The soft robot can grow and retract by eversion and inversion of its tubular body, a property we exploit in the interaction paradigms. We implemented and tested six different human-robot interaction paradigms, with full teleoperation at one extreme and gradually adding autonomy to various aspects of the task execution. All paradigms are demonstrated by two experts and two naive operators. Results show that humans and the soft robot manipulator can effectively split their control along different degrees of freedom while acting simultaneously to accomplish a task. In the simple pick-and-place task studied in this work, performance improves as the control is gradually given to the robot’s autonomy, especially when the robot can correct certain human errors. However, human engagement is maximized when the control over a task is at least partially shared. Finally, when the human operator is assisted by haptic guidance, which is computed based on soft robot tip position errors, we observed that the improvement in performance is dependent on the expertise of the human operator.	https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85171859599&origin=inward    https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007/s10846-023-01919-x.pdf	no

Hierarchical Goal-Guided Learning for the Evasive Maneuver of Fixed-Wing UAVs based on Deep Reinforcement Learning	Fixed-wing unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) will play a vital role in forthcoming military conflicts. Effectively avoiding threats and improving the survivability of fixed-wing UAV in dynamic hostile environments are the keys to the success of combat missions. Hence, endowing fixed-wing UAVs with the ability to autonomously generate evasive maneuver is the primary problem that should be solved. With considering the threat of air-to-air missile attacks, this paper designs a novel hierarchical goal-guided learning (HGGL) method, which combines with traditional off-policy deep reinforcement learning (DRL) algorithms and endows the agent with the ability to evade a series of air-to-air missiles. The pivotal idea of the proposed algorithm is to use the hierarchical features of the goal, it improves the availability of training data to eliminate the limitation of the convergence rate of traditional DRL algorithms owing to sparse rewards. We demonstrate the performance of our algorithm in several simulation experiments. All experiments are applied on the XSimStudio platform. The results demonstrate that the proposed algorithm improves the convergence speed and outperforms the state-of-the-art traditional algorithms.	https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85174443969&origin=inward    https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007/s10846-023-01953-9.pdf	no

Guaranteed Safe Path and Trajectory Tracking via Reachability Analysis Using Differential Inequalities	In many automated motion planning systems, vehicles are tasked with tracking a reference path or trajectory that is safe by design. However, due to various uncertainties, real vehicles may deviate from such references, potentially leading to collisions. This paper presents rigorous reachable set bounding methods for rapidly enclosing the set of possible deviations under uncertainty, which is critical information for online safety verification. The proposed approach applies recent advances in the theory of differential inequalities that exploit redundant model equations to achieve sharp bounds using only simple interval calculations. These methods have been shown to produce very sharp bounds at low cost for nonlinear systems in other application domains, but they rely on problem-specific insights to identify appropriate redundant equations, which makes them difficult to generalize and automate. Here, we demonstrate the application of these methods to tracking problems for the first time using three representative case studies. We find that defining redundant equations in terms of Lyapunov-like functions is particularly effective. The results show that this technique can produce effective bounds with computational times that are orders of magnitude less than the planned time horizon, making this a promising approach for online safety verification. This performance, however, comes at the cost of low generalizability, specifically due to the need for problem-specific insights and advantageous problem structure, such as the existence of appropriate Lyapunov-like functions.	https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85167426991&origin=inward    https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007/s10846-023-01928-w.pdf	no

Receding Horizon Control With Online Barrier Function Design Under Signal Temporal Logic Specifications	Signal temporal logic (STL) has been found to be an expressive language for describing complex, time-constrained tasks in several robotic applications. Existing methods encode such specifications by either using integer constraints or by employing set invariance techniques. While in the first case this results in a mixed integer linear program (MILP), control problems, in the latter case, designer-specific choices may induce conservatism in the robot's performance and the satisfaction of the task. In this article, a continuous-time receding horizon control scheme (RHS) is proposed that exploits the tradeoff between task satisfaction and performance costs such as actuation and state costs, traditionally considered in RHS schemes. The satisfaction of the STL tasks is encoded using time-varying control barrier functions that are designed online, thus avoiding the integer expressions that are often used in literature. The recursive feasibility of the proposed scheme is guaranteed by the satisfaction of a time-varying terminal constraint that ensures the satisfaction of the task with predetermined robustness. The effectiveness of the method is illustrated in a multirobot simulation scenario. Â© 1963-2012 IEEE.	https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85135759168&origin=inward	no
Viewpoint-Driven Formation Control of Airships for Cooperative Target Tracking	For tracking and motion capture (MoCap) of animals in their natural habitat, a formation of safe and silent aerial platforms, such as airships with on-board cameras, is well suited. In our prior work we derived formation properties for optimal MoCap, which include maintaining constant angular separation between observers w.r.t. the subject, threshold distance to it and keeping it centered in the camera view. Unlike multi-rotors, airships have non-holonomic constrains and are affected by ambient wind. Their orientation and flight direction are also tightly coupled. Therefore a control scheme for multicopters that assumes independence of motion direction and orientation is not applicable. In this letter, we address this problem by first exploiting a periodic relationship between the airspeed of an airship and its distance to the subject. We use it to derive analytical and numeric solutions that satisfy the formation properties for optimal MoCap. Based on this, we develop an MPC-based formation controller. We perform theoretical analysis of our solution, boundary conditions of its applicability, extensive simulation experiments and a real world demonstration of our control method with an unmanned airship.

A Deadlock-Free Hybrid Estimation of Distribution Algorithm for Cooperative Multi-UAV Task Assignment with Temporally Coupled Constraints	This article addresses the cooperative multiunmanned aerial vehicles task assignment problem (CMTAP) with temporally coupled constraints and aims to find a feasible assignment to minimize the equivalent distances of all tasks. We first present a mixed-integer linear programming model of CMTAP. To solve the undesirable deadlocks of CMTAP, a Petri net amender is constructed based on a candidate solution, and a deadlock-free solution is equivalent to a feasible transition sequence that can be fired sequentially in the corresponding amender. With this amender, we present a Petri net-based deadlock amending method (PDAM) with polynomial time complexity to convert a deadlocked solution into a deadlock-free solution. Also, a deadlock-free hybrid estimation of distribution algorithm (DHEDA) is developed for CMTAP by embedding PDAM into the original EDA. To further improve the solution quality, we establish a local exploitation method, and an adaptive operational probability is used to balance the computational burden and local exploitation ability. Then, a match-up-based reassignment method is proposed to cope with time-sensitive targets. Finally, extensive computational experiments demonstrate that PDAM is more effective at solving deadlocks than graph-based methods, particularly for large-scale CMTAP, and DHEDA outperforms existing algorithms when solving CMTAP.

S-VIO: Exploiting Structural Constraints for RGB-D Visual Inertial Odometry	Vision-based localization is an essential problem for autonomous systems while the performance of vision-based odometry degrades in the challenging scenario. This letter presents S-VIO, an RGB-D visual inertial odometry (VIO) which fully uses multi-sensor measurements (i.e. depth, RGB and IMU), heterogeneous landmarks (i.e. points, lines and planes) and structural regularity of the environment to obtain a robust and accurate localization result. In order to detect the underlying structural regularity of the environment, a two-step Atlanta world inference method is proposed. Leveraging the gravity direction estimated by the VIO system, the proposed algorithm first generates horizontal Atlanta axis hypotheses from a set of recently optimized plane landmarks. Then the following plane landmarks and line clusters are used to filter out the occasionally observed axes based on the persistence of the observation. The remaining axes will survive and be saved in the Atlanta map for future re-observations. Particularly, an efficient mined-and-stabbed (MnS) method is applied to classify the structural line and extract the vanishing point from each line cluster. In addition, a closed-form initialization method for the structural line feature is proposed, which leverages the known direction to obtain a better initial estimation. Integrated with the above novelties, S-VIO is tested on two public real-world RGB-D inertial datasets. Experiments demonstrate that S-VIO has better accuracy and robustness compared to state-of-the-art VIO and RGB-D VIO algorithms.

Adaptive cylinder vector particle swarm optimization with differential evolution for UAV path planning	Particle swarm optimization (PSO) algorithm has a potential to solve route planning problem for unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV). However, the traditional PSO algorithm is easy to fall into local optimum under the complicated environments with multiple threats. In order to improve the performance in different complicated environments, a novel and effective PSO algorithm with adaptive adjustment of the parameters, cylinder vector and different evolution operator, named ACVDEPSO, is proposed and demonstrated to be effective for route planning problem for UAV. In the proposed ACVDEPSO, the velocity of the particle is converted to its cylinder vector for the convenience of the path search. It is worth highlighting that the parameters of ACVDEPSO algorithm are automatically chosen by the time and the fitness values of the particles. Furthermore, a challenger based on differential evolution operator is introduced to reduce the probability of falling into local optimum and accelerate the algorithm convergence speed. The simulation experiments have been conducted in real digital elevation model (DEM) maps to test the performance of the ACVDEPSO. The experiment results validate that the optimization performance of the ACVDEPSO outperforms the other comparison methods, which can efficiently generate a higher quality path for UAV under the complicated 3D environments.

Privacy-Preserving Object Detection With Poisoning Recognition for Autonomous Vehicles	Object detection has achieved significant progress in attaining high-quality performance without leaking private messages. However, traditional approaches cannot defend the poisoning attacks. Poisoning attacks can make the predictive model unusable, which quickly causes recognition errors or even traffic accidents. In this paper, we propose a privacy-preserving object detection with poisoning recognition (PR-PPOD) framework via distributed training with the help of the CNN, ResNet18, and classical SSD network. Specifically, we design a poisoning model recognition algorithm to remove the uploaded local poisoning parameters to guarantee a trained model's availability based on given privacy-preserving progress. More importantly, the PR-PPOD framework can effectively prevent the threat of differential attacks and avoid privacy leakage caused by reverse model reasoning. Moreover, the effectiveness, efficiency, and security of PR-PPOD are demonstrated via comprehensive theoretical analysis. Finally, we simulate the performance of local poisoning model recognition based on the MNIST, CIFAR10, VOC2007, and VOC2012 datasets, which could achieve good performance compared with the case without poisoning recognition.

Resource Allocation in a Secure Internet of Battle Vehicles Through RF Fingerprint Recognition	In the internet of battle vehicles (IoBV), a few unauthorized users may attack and intrude on a network. The attackers who sneak into the network may maliciously occupy invaluable wireless resources that are supposed to serve authorized users. To guarantee the quality of service (QoS) of authorized users, we novelly propose an architecture of secure IoBV through the radio frequency (RF) fingerprint recognition technology and investigate the optimal resource allocation scheme under such an architecture. With few training samples, we propose a meta-transfer-based few-shot learning method for RF fingerprint recognition and an algorithm to optimize the data rate in an IoBV. Compared with a few benchmarks, the analysis results show that our proposed algorithm can improve the overall data rate and reduce the computation time.

An Example Application for An Identification of Friend and Foe (IFF) System Appropriate for Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAV) Based on Deep Learning	Drone/UAV systems are used for the solution of different problems that exist in different fields, in a way that pushes the limits of the human imagination. The services provided by UAV systems are used in the process of many sectors and in daily life. Security is one of the areas UAV systems are used, in line with the historical origin of the system. Undoubtedly, as in every technological innovation, in parallel with the increase in the use of UAV systems for the benefit of humanity, there is also an increase and diversification in illegal activities. Due to the fact that UAV systems offer cheaper, risk-free and cost-effective solutions, there is a global increase in the frequency and diversity of the use of them by terrorist organizations. It would not be an exaggeration that the airspaces, which have been under the sovereignty of states until today and where terrorist organizations did not exist much, are now used by them. Despite the complex and expensive detection, identification, warning and prevention systems that states continue to develop to prevent air threats, the fact that terrorist organizations can carry out attacks with simple and inexpensive UAV systems confirms this determination. Based on the assumption that an UAV-based method can be developed for the solution of the identified problem, in this study an autonomous system has been tried to be developed that can perform control, surveillance and safety flight in a certain airspace, detect intruder systems during flight and lock on them with its software.	https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007/s10846-023-01840-3.pdf    https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85149996301&origin=inward	no
A Framework for Vision-Based Building Detection and Entering for Autonomous Delivery Drones	Autonomous delivery by aerial robots inside urban environments is getting closer to be operational everyday, but several concerns about proper navigation sources are to be addressed. As lot of GPS glitches are observed in urban environments, hereon a fully vision-based navigation framework is developed. The platform is assumed to have the ability to get into a vicinity of its destination using available “imperfect” navigation methods like GPS. Hereupon, the autonomous execution of mission is divided into four consecutive phases, all relying on a forward-looking camera: I) A novel vision-based method for detecting and confirming the target facade in the batch of neighboring buildings is introduced that performs matching using neural networks exploiting the texture features of facade segments; II) The intended window among the facade windows array is detected in real-time; III) The robot is guided to autonomously approach the intended window by a proper visual tracking algorithm; IV) Finally, a collision-free passage through the portal section of window based on visual Time-To-Contact estimation is commanded for the safe entrance. The network is trained using approximately 34,000 feature samples from a set of real-world building facades. As a result, a 95.4% accuracy along with 81.4% classification precision and 87.6% recall are achieved for the trained network in correct facade detection and confirmation. Also, the success rate of overall entrance mission is found to be 13 out of 15 in real world experiments, provided the initial distance being less than 20 meters.	https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85150872206&origin=inward    https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007/s10846-023-01834-1.pdf	no

Automated firearms detection in cargo x-ray images using RetinaNet	We present a method for the automated detection of firearms in cargo x-ray images using RetinaNet. RetinaNet is a recently proposed powerful object detection framework that is shown to surpass the detection performance of state-of-art two-stage R-CNN family object detectors while matching the speed of one-stage object detection algorithms. We trained our models from scratch by generating training data with threat image projection (TIP) that alleviates the class imbalance problem inherent to the x-ray security inspection and eliminates the need for costly and tedious staged data collection. The method is tested on unseen weapons that are also injected into unseen cargo images using TIP. Variations in cargo content and background clutter is considered in training and testing datasets. We demonstrated RetinaNet-based firearm detection model matches the detection accuracies of traditional sliding-windows convolutional neural net firearm detectors while offering more precise object localization, and significantly faster detection speed.	https://www.spiedigitallibrary.org/conference-proceedings-of-spie/10999/109990P/Automated-firearms-detection-in-cargo-x-ray-images-using-RetinaNet/10.1117/12.2517817.pdf    https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85072304960&origin=inward	no

Steps toward a principled approach to automating cyber responses	Cyber-attackers are likely to exploit advances in artificial intelligence to achieve faster, stealthier, and more effective operational effects. Defenders need to keep pace by developing their own advances, which may preclude human-in-theloop decision making. Consequently, future systems will have to rely on automated reasoning and automated responses to ensure mission success and continuously adapt to an evolving adversary. Automated reasoning about defensive cyber responses is essentially sequential decision making based on the projection of possible futures from a current situation. This problem is especially complicated in cyberspace, however, because the current situation and future projections are highly uncertain. Our research tackles these challenges using the formal framework of partially observable Markov decision problems (POMDPs). We show how to break the “curse of dimensionality” that makes these problems intractable by computing approximate solutions using a Monte Carlo online planner that incorporates a computationally feasible simulation of the cyber security problem. Our simulation is an extension of MITRE’s Cyber Security Game simulator, which explores the mission-impact-focused strategies of an adaptive, intelligent attacker. Preliminary results on small problems, where the optimal solution can be calculated precisely, show that our approach consistently finds the optimal answer, not just a good approximation. We are in the process of increasing the fidelity of the simulator and POMDP representation to model more realistic cyber environments by increasing attacker and defender actions, increasing the variety of sensor types (including sensing of both actions and states), accounting for multiple incident effects, and improving the scaling properties.	https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85072092007&origin=inward    https://www.spiedigitallibrary.org/conference-proceedings-of-spie/11006/110061E/Steps-toward-a-principled-approach-to-automating-cyber-responses/10.1117/12.2518976.pdf	no

PSO algorithm for UAV autonomous path planning with threat and energy cost optimization	The PSO (Particle Swarm Optimization) algorithm uses a population of single particles, randomly distributed over the function search space, in order to construct an optimal flight path. During the algorithm iteration execution, each particle evaluates its fitness function according to the actual position. Then, every particle moves towards a direction dependent on its actual best position and the position of the best particle so far. The procedure ends when the iteration limit is reached or fitness criterium is met. In the presented autonomous UAV 3D path planning method, a PSO algorithm is used to build a feasible path, optimized in terms of fuel and threat cost. The process begins when the UAV detects or receives information about threats appearing on its primary trajectory. The population of particles moves in the search space of three variables, which are the angles of pitch, roll and yaw. These angles determine the spatial orientation of the UAV, indicating its direction of movement in each step. Further waypoints are chosen with consideration of the distance to the target and violation of threat areas. As a final result, the PSO algorithm constructs a suboptimal, feasible path which could be used as a reference trajectory for the UAV’s automatic control system. Simulation results turned out to be completely repeatable and indistinguishable, despite the stochastic nature of the algorithm, which proves its great optimization abilities. Moreover, its short execution time (within seconds) allows this procedure to be used in real time applications.	https://www.spiedigitallibrary.org/conference-proceedings-of-spie/11055/110550T/PSO-algorithm-for-UAV-autonomous-path-planning-with-threat-and/10.1117/12.2524886.pdf    https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85063899580&origin=inward	no
Embedded implementation of a random feature detecting network for real-time classification of time-of-flight SPAD array recordings	A real time program is implemented to classify different model airplanes imaged using a 32x32 SPAD array camera in time-of-flight mode. The algorithm uses random feature extractors in series with a linear classifier and is implemented on the NVIDIA Jetson TX2 platform, a power efficient embedded computing device. The algorithm is trained by calculating the classification matrix using a simple pseudoinverse operation on collected image data with known corresponding object labels. The implementation in this work uses a combination of serial and parallel processes and is optimized for classifying airplane models imaged by the SPAD and laser system. The performance of different numbers of convolutional filters is tested in real time. The classification accuracy reaches up to 98.7% and the execution time on the TX2 varies between 34.30 and 73.55 ms depending on the number of convolutional filters used. Furthermore, image acquisition and classification use 5.1 W of power on the TX2 board. Along with its small size and low weight, the TX2 platform can be exploited for high-speed operation in applications that require classification of aerial targets where the SPAD imaging system and embedded device are mounted on a UAS.	https://www.spiedigitallibrary.org/conference-proceedings-of-spie/11005/1100505/Embedded-implementation-of-a-random-feature-detecting-network-for-real/10.1117/12.2517875.pdf    https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85072523666&origin=inward	no
Identifying low-profile objects from low-light UAS imagery using cascading deep learning	Unmanned aircraft systems (UAS) have gained utility in the Navy for many purposes, including facility needs, security, and intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance (ISR). UAS surveys can be employed in place of personnel to reduce safety risks, but they generate significant quantities of data that often require manual review. Research and development of automated methods to identify targets of interest in this type of imagery data can provide multiple benefits, including increasing efficiency, decreasing cost, and potentially saving lives through identification of hazards or threats. This paper presents a methodology to efficiently and effectively identify cryptic target objects from UAS imagery. The approach involves flight and processing of airborne imagery in low-light conditions to find low-profile objects (i.e., birds) in beach and desert-like environments. The object classification algorithms combat the low-light conditions and low-profile nature of the objects of interest using cascading models and a tailored deep convolutional neural network (CNN) architecture. Models were able to identify and count endangered birds (California least terns) and nesting sites on beaches from UAS survey data, achieving negative/positive classification accuracies from candidate images upwards of 97% and an <i>f</i><sub>1</sub> score for detection of 0:837.	https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85072512054&origin=inward    https://www.spiedigitallibrary.org/conference-proceedings-of-spie/11001/1100116/Identifying-low-profile-objects-from-low-light-UAS-imagery-using/10.1117/12.2518259.pdf	no
UAV detection, tracking, and classification by sensor fusion of a 360° lidar system and an alignable classification sensor	The number of reported incidents caused by UAVs, intentional as well as accidental, is rising. To avoid such incidents in future, it is essential to be able to detect UAVs. However, not every UAV is a potential threat and therefore the UAV not only has to be detected, but classified or identified. 360<sup>o</sup> scanning LiDAR systems can be deployed for the detection and tracking of (micro) UAVs in ranges up to 50 m. Unfortunately, the verification and classification of the detected objects is not possible in most cases, due to the low resolution of that kind of sensor. In this paper, we propose an automatic alignment of an additional sensor (mounted on a pan-tilt head) for the identification of the detected objects. The classification sensor is directed by the tracking results of the panoramic LiDAR sensor. If the alignable sensor is an RGB- or infrared camera, the identification of the objects can be done by state-of-the-art image processing algorithms. If a higher-resolution LiDAR sensor is used for this task, algorithms have to be developed and implemented. For example, the classification could be realized by a 3D model matching method. After the handoff of the object position from the 360<sup>o</sup> LiDAR to the verification sensor, this second system can be used for a further tracking of the object, e.g., if the trajectory of the UAV leaves the field of view of the primary LiDAR system. The paper shows first results of this multi-sensor classification approach.	https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85072526998&origin=inward    https://www.spiedigitallibrary.org/conference-proceedings-of-spie/11005/110050E/UAV-detection-tracking-and-classification-by-sensor-fusion-of-a/10.1117/12.2518427.pdf	no
Study on extraction of foreign invasive species Mikania micrantha based on unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) hyperspectral remote sensing	<i>Mikania micrantha</i> is a harmful foreign invasive species, which poses a great threat to the ecological balance and forestry production in southern China. In the study, typical <i>Mikania micrantha</i> multi-incidence area was used as the research area. After data pre-processing, 250 bands were obtained and subjected to a single factor ANOVA analysis. Anterior 10 bands with F values from the largest to the smallest were selected as the spectral characteristic bands. Spectral characteristics were extracted, together with texture characteristics. Texture characteristic of hyperspectral data was calculated by Gray level co-occurrence matrix, with processing window sizes of 11, 15, 21, 31, 41, 51, respectively. Results showed that the mean and second moment in processing window of 15 was more appropriate. A total of 200 verification points were randomly selected from five flight concentration areas. Visual interpretation was performed to verify the accuracy of the extraction. Results showed that the total accuracy was 85.5%. In this paper, key technology of unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) hyperspectral remote sensing for extracting <i>Mikania micrantha</i> was studied, having constructed process of extracting the <i>Mikania micrantha</i> range by UAV hyperspectral data.

Generalization of active radar imaging and passive imaging models applied to wide band terahertz array imaging systems	System solutions for commercial applications such as autonomous driving, augmented reality, medical imaging, and security imaging, exploit active illumination. In these applications, the active source is used to provide photons but also to code and decode relevant information such as range or spectral response. The wavelengths of choice range from visible to millimeter waves depending on the application and associated requirements. Across these wavelengths, the targets range from Lambertian to specular. For single element and scanned systems, ranging is commonly modeled using conventions borrowed from the radar and antenna community. Staring and scanning systems that facilitate resolution in the cross-range are modeled using conventions borrowed from the synthetic aperture radar community or the passive imaging community. All the borrowed conventions, however, make assumptions about the size and nature of the target in relationship to the illumination and wavelength, unresolved versus resolved and Lambertian versus specular. These assumptions are relevant for the calculation of system signal to noise ratio and resolution; therefore, they should be carefully considered when adopting the conventions. Examples of systems where modeling falls between active radar and passive imaging include wide band Terahertz array imaging systems and solid state lidar systems. This paper generalizes and bridges the models used by the active radar community and the passive imaging community. We apply the model to a wide band terahertz array imaging system enabled by terahertz array technology recently developed at imec. The model is validated using simulated measurements from a two-dimensional terahertz array.	https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85072526122&origin=inward    https://www.spiedigitallibrary.org/conference-proceedings-of-spie/11001/110010H/Generalization-of-active-radar-imaging-and-passive-imaging-models-applied/10.1117/12.2519683.pdf	no

Tracking and prediction of small unmanned aerial vehicles' flight behavior and three-dimensional flight path from laser gated viewing images	In the last decade, small and mirco unmanned aerial vehicles (MUAV) have become an increasing risk to security and safety in civilian and military scenarios. Further, countermeasures are hard to deploy due to the MUAV ability to operate with highly agile flight maneuver and the physical constrains due to very small cross-sections as well for RADAR as for LiDAR detection. The French-German Research Institute of Saint-Louis (ISL) is studying heterogeneous sensor networks for detection and identification of threats. Shortwave laser gated viewing is used to record images of the target and different image processing algorithms and filters are investigated to perform reliable tracking of MUAV flying in front of textured and clear sky backgrounds. Here, an analysis approach is presented to analyze the MUAV flight behavior and three-dimensional path from image data. Further, a prediction approach is presented to estimate the target position in near future.	https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85072517350&origin=inward    https://www.spiedigitallibrary.org/conference-proceedings-of-spie/11005/110050D/Tracking-and-prediction-of-small-unmanned-aerial-vehicles-flight-behavior/10.1117/12.2519273.pdf	no

Physically realizable adversarial examples for convolutional object detection algorithms	In our work, we make two primary contributions to the field of adversarial example generation for convolutional neural network based perception technologies. First of all, we extend recent work on physically realizable adversarial examples to make them more robust to translation, rotation, and scale in real-world scenarios. Secondly, we demonstrate attacks against object detection neural networks rather than considering only the simpler problem of classification, demonstrating the ability to force these networks to mislocalize as well as misclassify.

Doppler-vibrometer landmine-detection system operated from a moving vehicle	Detection of landmines at modest distances from a moving vehicle is desired to help protect soldiers from explosive threats. The US Department of Defense developed a sensor system to observe seismic vibration patterns that lead to detection of buried objects in unpaved roads. The system is capable of exciting soil acoustically and observing seismic responses while advancing at 1m/s with a 30m standoff. The optical design and build created 960 simultaneous independent spatial observations that collect data over a 0.5m x 1m area. A gimbal then repositions the sensor to collect a new region. In this sequential manner the system can scan 2m x 1km in less than 30min. Active gimbal stabilization kept beam positions relatively stable on the ground while the vehicle was in motion. Inertial sensing reduced gross Doppler components common to all channels. Even with these corrections, channel dropouts remained a challenge, so filtering of erroneous samples in time and space was required to improve the data quality. Automated target recognition algorithms quickly process the spatial vibration data to warn operators of a threat. We present here an overview of the system and collected data. The system proved effective at finding buried threats that produced seismic anomalies at the surface, but additional challenges lie in differentiating target responses from clutter. The seismic response of naturally occurring environmental clutter in roads produces responses that appear similar to objects of interest, reducing the effectiveness of target detection algorithms.	https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85068535890&origin=inward    https://www.spiedigitallibrary.org/conference-proceedings-of-spie/11012/110120W/Doppler-vibrometer-landmine-detection-system-operated-from-a-moving-vehicle/10.1117/12.2519299.pdf	no

Active and passive computational imaging for tracking and prediction of three-dimensional MUAV flight paths	Micro unmanned aerial vehicles (MUAV) have become increasingly popular during the last decade due to their access to a wide consumer market. With the increasing number of MUAV, the unintended and intended misuse by flying close to sensitive areas has risen as a potentially increasing risk. To counter this threat, surveillance systems are under development which will monitor the MUAV flight behavior. In this context, the reliable tracking and prediction of the MUAV flight behavior is crucial to increase the performance of countermeasures. In this paper, we discuss electro-optical computational imaging methods with a focus on the ability to perform a tracking of the three dimensional (3D) flight path. We evaluate the analysis of different imaging methods performed with active laser detection as well as with passive imaging using advanced scenario analysis. In first experimental investigation, we recorded and analyzed image sequences of a MUAV quad-copter flying at low altitude in laboratory and in outdoor scenario. Our results show, that we are able to track the three dimensional flight path with high accuracy and we are able to give a reliable prediction of the MUAV flight behavior within the near future.	https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85078054978&origin=inward    https://www.spiedigitallibrary.org/conference-proceedings-of-spie/11160/1116009/Active-and-passive-computational-imaging-for-tracking-and-prediction-of/10.1117/12.2532727.pdf	no
Assistance system for the situation aware defense of danger through unmanned aerial systems	Today, unmanned aerial systems (UAS) are being used for a growing range of useful applications. This has been drastically increased during the last few years. The market is growing and a wide range of affordable and capable products is available. However, also the misuse of such systems is growing and has become a big problem for public security, private areas and industrial facilities. Therefore, products for detection, classification and countermeasures are an upcoming market though a complete solution is not yet present. At the Fraunhofer IOSB, a research project has been set up in 2017 with its aim to develop an interactive detection and analyzing tool that helps the security staff in situation analysis and decision making during the handling of threatening situations caused by the misuse of drones. Beginning with different measuring devices and data fusion of these channels in order to generate a situational picture the systems handle a comprehensive risk management while calculating the chances of countermeasures. The user is supported by situational awareness tools and simulation/prognosis of possible scenarios during the complete process. The objective is the optimal cognition for the users and to assist during the solution finding. There is no automatic decision and no automatic reaction without humans in the decision loop.	https://www.spiedigitallibrary.org/conference-proceedings-of-spie/11166/111660I/Assistance-system-for-the-situation-aware-defense-of-danger-through/10.1117/12.2537975.pdf    https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85077319955&origin=inward	no
Enabling intelligent battlefield healthcare through secure cyber medicine	Providing advanced healthcare to the warfighters in the battlefield has proven challenging due to the difficult environmental conditions and geographical separation between the injured warrior and healthcare providers. The introduction of Cyber Medicine enables physicians and soldiers to utilize technologies including mobile apps, robotics, connectivity to wired/wireless networks, satellites, clouds, HPCs, and software to identify, assess and treat the injured. However, what happens when the adversary attacks the cyber domain in addition to the physical domain? The answer could be that all automated systems will become suspect whether they are embedded systems, information processing systems, diagnosis and triage systems, or remote surgical robotics. This analysis identifies areas where the intelligent Cyber-Medical System can provide better healthcare to the battlefield including services to the disadvantaged soldier at the edge. Architecting intelligent systems starts with learning the desired system operation, sifting through historical data and procedure outcomes, assessing vulnerabilities, then delivering systems that mimics and augment human performance to solve problems. The battlefield Cybermedicine has the challenge of increased cyber security risks due to the need to be deployed in hostile environment, and the challenge of dealing with injuries that are unique to the battlefield. Moreover, the viability of intelligent automation depends on reliable connectivity and availability of reliable data and infrastructure, while the battlefield lacks both those conditions. The goal of this study is to deliver medical services and alleviate the vulnerability impacts through more secure design, development, deployment, maintenance, and operations. Additionally, this paper introduces new cybermedicine concepts and architectures that benefit from the various types of Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence to build Cyber-Medical System that can resist corruption from unauthenticated users/data, and from active malware and physical media attacks.	https://www.spiedigitallibrary.org/conference-proceedings-of-spie/11015/110150M/Enabling-intelligent-battlefield-healthcare-through-secure-cyber-medicine/10.1117/12.2516021.pdf    https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85073904160&origin=inward	no
A utility-driven surveillance approach to trade-off security and privacy	In recent years advances in machine learning methods such as deep learning has led to significant improvements in our ability to track people and vehicles, and to recognise specific individuals. Such technology has enormous potential to enhance the performance of image-based security systems. However, wide-spread use of such technology has important legal and ethical implications, not least for individuals right to privacy. In this paper, we describe a technological approach to balance the two competing goals of system efficacy and privacy. We describe a methodology for constructing a “goal-function” that reflects the operators preferences for detection performance and anonymity. This goal function is combined with an image-processing system that provides tracking and threat assessment functionality and a decision-making framework that assesses the potential value gained by providing the operator with de-anonymized images. The framework provides a probabilistic approach combining user preferences, world state model, possible user actions and threat mitigation effectiveness, and suggests the user action with the largest estimated utility. We show results of operating the system in a perimeter-protection scenario	https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85077329613&origin=inward    https://www.spiedigitallibrary.org/conference-proceedings-of-spie/11166/111660S/A-utility-driven-surveillance-approach-to-trade-off-security-and/10.1117/12.2533741.pdf	maybe
NATO SET-249 joint measurement campaign on laser dazzle effects in airborne scenarios	In October 2018, NATO SET-249 performed a common trial at WTD 52, Oberjettenberg, Germany, to study laser dazzle effects in an airborne scenario. The facility is equipped with a cable car and is ideal for slanted path experiments from the base station to the cable car where the sensors were mounted. NATO SET-249’s background is laser threat evaluation and the evaluation of the impact of laser eye dazzle on the visual performance of humans. This work gives an overview on the various measurements performed here: 1. Assessment of dazzle effects originating from light scattering at an aircraft canopy by comparing the images of two cameras: one outside and one inside the canopy. The general findings showed that the canopy, which had been used previously on an aircraft, substantially affected the dazzle pattern in the camera within the canopy as compared to the camera outside. 2. Sensor dazzling: Laser dazzling of complementary metal-oxide-semiconductor (CMOS) cameras in the visible domain and, in addition, laser dazzling of a camera equipped with a fisheye lens, which is commonly present in micro-unmanned aerial vehicles, is demonstrated. The dazzled area in the camera field of view (FoV) grows with increasing laser irradiance, and dazzling is effective at irradiance levels around a few μW/cm². 3. An overview on realistic handheld laser engagement scenarios to test the capabilities of a DSTL-developed Laser Event Recorder (LER) is provided. This technology is able to detect continuous wave (CW) and pulsed lasers, and extract their wavelengths, irradiances, Pulse Repetition Frequency (PRF) and directionality. Applications for this LER include collecting information on aircraft laser exposure events, giving information to assess if engagements are eye safe. 4. Measurements performed on various Fraunhofer IOSB developed sensor systems hardened against laser dazzle: The hardening measure of these systems is based either on the use of spatial light modulators or on the implementation of the principle of complementary wavelength bands. The field trial offered the possibility to generate data of the hardened systems under real life conditions.	https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85077185014&origin=inward    https://www.spiedigitallibrary.org/conference-proceedings-of-spie/11161/111610C/NATO-SET-249-joint-measurement-campaign-on-laser-dazzle-effects/10.1117/12.2533744.pdf	no

Modelling of UAV range measurement	Nowadays, there is wide spectrum of areas of use of small unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV, drones). Their low cost, flexibility of use, low service cost and independence on infrastructure make them ideal carriers of different cargo. This fact brings many significant safety risk and threats. Especially aerial survey, flight zones disruptions and transport dangerous cargo. Above mentioned threat can be eliminated by: disabling navigation and control features, taking control over the steering and object destruction. One of the possible typically military solutions of that situation, is destruction by shooting. The most common way of solving the above task, is the use of barrel weapons of individual shooter or small military units. Therefore, we focused our effort on preventing the UAV mission accomplishing by its shooting destruction. To accomplish the task, in addition to detection and identification, we consider the distance determination as a fundamental problem. For the purposes of this paper, the distance determination we consider as a “localization”. Comparison of UAV localization options is the issue of this paper. Two localizations methods have been defined. Localization option include active method (ILR – impulse laser rangefinder) and passive method (triangulation method). Using mathematical modelling we proved, that ILR measurement is possible. To determine a distance with a defined probability we designed specific measurement frequency. For a predetermined type of UAV and ILR we identified the maximum distance that can be measured. In the second part of this paper, we analyzed the accuracy of localization using the triangulation method. The accuracy of localization using this method is dependent on the squared of the UAV distance. There are two significant advantage of this method: measurements can be made continuously and multiple objects in the field of view can be measured at the same time. This article is part of a planned publishing activity dealing with the issue	https://www.spiedigitallibrary.org/conference-proceedings-of-spie/11166/111660F/Modelling-of-UAV-range-measurement/10.1117/12.2533043.pdf    https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85077303460&origin=inward	no
Intelligent autonomous vehicles with an extendable knowledge base under meaningful human control	Intelligent robotic autonomous systems (unmanned aerial/ground/surface/underwater vehicles) are attractive for military application to relieve humans from tedious or dangerous tasks. These systems require awareness of the environment and their own performance to reach a mission goal. This awareness enables them to adapt their operations to handle unexpected changes in the environment and uncertainty in assessments. Components of the autonomous system cannot rely on perfect awareness or actuator execution, and mistakes of one component can affect the entire system. To obtain a robust system, a system-wide approach is needed and a realistic model of all aspects of the system and its environment. In this paper, we present our study on the design and development of a fully functional autonomous system, consisting of sensors, observation processing and behavior analysis, information database, knowledge base, communication, planning processes, and actuators. The system behaves as a teammate of a human operator and can perform tasks independently with minimal interaction. The system keeps the human informed about relevant developments that may require human assistance, and the human can always redirect the system with high-level instructions. The communication behavior is implemented as a Social AI Layer (SAIL). The autonomous system was tested in a simulation environment to support rapid prototyping and evaluation. The simulation is based on the Robotic Operating System (ROS) with fully modelled sensors and actuators and the 3D graphics-enabled physics simulation software Gazebo. In this simulation, various flying and driving autonomous systems can execute their tasks in a realistic 3D environment with scripted or user-controlled threats. The results show the performance of autonomous operation as well as interaction with humans.	https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85077344620&origin=inward    https://www.spiedigitallibrary.org/conference-proceedings-of-spie/11166/111660C/Intelligent-autonomous-vehicles-with-an-extendable-knowledge-base-under-meaningful/10.1117/12.2533740.pdf	no
Mangrove ecosystem data inventory using unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) in Yogyakarta coastal area	Mangrove ecosystem is one of coastal resources that have many benefits for coastal communities. The mangrove ecosystem has very high economic and ecological functions if it is developed and preserved properly. Nowadays, many mangrove ecosystems are threatened by human activities. It is necessary to preserve and to develop the mangrove ecosystems to avoid the impact of human activity and to increase their usefulness. In the process of developing the mangrove ecosystems, detailed data are required to provide a comprehensive overview of the environmental and physical conditions of the mangrove ecosystems. The study aims at identifying and making the inventory of the existing condition of the mangrove ecosystems related to mangrove cover and biodiversity. The data are collected using aerial photography and UAVs, observation and field measurement. The data inventory making is the first step in the process of developing and preserving the mangrove ecosystems. It finds that the use of the UAVs for the mangrove ecosystem data inventory making can give high accuracy data. The mangrove cover can easily be identified using image segmentation or onscreen digitization analysis. Finally, the UAVs can be a promising technology in the management and the monitoring of the mangrove ecosystems.	https://www.spiedigitallibrary.org/conference-proceedings-of-spie/11311/113110M/Mangrove-ecosystem-data-inventory-using-unmanned-aerial-vehicles-UAVs-in/10.1117/12.2547326.pdf    https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85077967945&origin=inward	no
Evaluation of acoustic detection of UAVs using machine learning methods	In the past years, small unmanned aerial vehicles have increasingly become a hard to defend against threat to both military and civilian infrastructure. Both DIY and COTS UAVs are difficult to detect in a realistic environment, particularly in a cluttered and noisy one such as a port facility. In this context the use of active detection systems such as radar, and lidar is limited since it should not adversely interfere with the normal operation of the port, in particular the existing harbour sensors. This leads our interest towards passive multi-sensor detection systems such as electro-optic (EO) and acoustic monitoring. This work investigates the capability of passive acoustic systems to detect small commercial UAVs within the context of a harbour. We use a machine learning approach to detection using real-world data. We collected audio signatures of several different types of commercial off-the-shelf UAVs both in a quiet environment and in a variety of complex real environment. For this we used a directional 4-microphone array composed of readily available audio components. This setup limited our experiment to the audible spectrum, in which motor and propeller noise are the main characteristics used to distinguish the UAV from the background sounds. We studied machine learning algorithms typically applied to this category of problems, and implemented a Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM) classifier using the Mel-Frequency Cepstrum Coefficient (MFCC) as a feature representation of the audio data, and apply this to the data collected during our measurement campaigns.	https://www.spiedigitallibrary.org/conference-proceedings-of-spie/11166/111660H/Evaluation-of-acoustic-detection-of-UAVs-using-machine-learning-methods/10.1117/12.2532775.pdf    https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85077322387&origin=inward	no

UAV radar imaging for target detection	The paper deals with subsurface imaging via radar systems mounted onboard aerial platforms. Specifically, the attention is focused on a radar prototype installed on a small unmanned aerial vehicle (S-UAV), previously proposed by few of the authors. In particular, the challenges in terms of electromagnetic modeling and flight dynamics knowledge and control are here tackled. In this frame, an ad-hoc designed data processing strategy is presented; this strategy involves a preprocessing step and a reconstruction step. The pre-processing is performed in time domain and, beyond filtering procedures commonly exploited in radar imaging, involves a procedure devoted to compensate flight altitude variations and to account for the S-UAV trajectory, which is estimated by processing measurements collected by an onboard GPS receiver. In addition, the reconstruction of the investigated scenario is performed by means of a microwave tomographic approach based on a linear model of the electromagnetic scattering and the concept of equivalent dielectric permittivity for the propagation path. This latter allows us to properly face the imaging of buried objects, while avoiding the mathematical complexity introduced by the presence of the air-medium interface. Accordingly, the imaging is faced as a linear inverse scattering problem formulated in the spatial domain similarly to the case of a homogeneous scenario and, thanks to the concept of equivalent permittivity, depth and horizontal position of buried objects are retrieved properly. This is corroborated by means of a numerical analysis accounting for synthetic data.	https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85072629729&origin=inward    https://www.spiedigitallibrary.org/conference-proceedings-of-spie/11059/110590F/UAV-radar-imaging-for-target-detection/10.1117/12.2525364.pdf	no
See clearer at night: towards robust nighttime semantic segmentation through day-night image conversion	In recent years, intelligent driving navigation and security monitoring have made considerable progress with the help of deep Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). As one of the state-of-the-art perception approaches, semantic segmentation unifies distinct detection tasks widely desired by both autonomous driving and security monitoring. Currently, semantic segmentation shows remarkable efficiency and reliability in standard scenarios such as daytime scenes with favorable illumination conditions. However, in face of adverse conditions such as the nighttime, semantic segmentation loses its accuracy significantly. One of the main causes of the problem is the lack of sufficient annotated segmentation datasets of nighttime scenes. In this paper, we propose a framework to alleviate the accuracy decline when semantic segmentation is taken to adverse conditions by using Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs). To bridge the daytime and nighttime image domains, we made key observation that compared to datasets in adverse conditions, there are considerable amount of segmentation datasets in standard conditions such as BDD and our collected ZJU datasets. Our GAN-based nighttime semantic segmentation framework includes two methods. In the first method, GANs were used to translate nighttime images to the daytime, thus semantic segmentation can be performed using robust models already trained on daytime datasets. In another method, we use GANs to translate different ratio of daytime images in the dataset to the nighttime but still with their labels. In this sense, synthetic nighttime segmentation datasets can be generated to yield models prepared to operate at nighttime conditions robustly. In our experiment, the later method significantly boosts the performance at the nighttime evidenced by quantitative results using Intersection over Union (IoU) and Pixel Accuracy (Acc). We show that the performance varies with respect to the proportion of synthetic nighttime images in the dataset, where the sweet spot corresponds to most robust performance across the day and night. The proposed framework not only makes contribution to the optimization of visual perception in intelligent vehicles, but also can be applied to diverse navigational assistance systems.	https://www.spiedigitallibrary.org/conference-proceedings-of-spie/11169/111690A/See-clearer-at-night--towards-robust-nighttime-semantic-segmentation/10.1117/12.2532477.pdf    https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85077332282&origin=inward	no
Infrared object image instance segmentation based on improved mask-RCNN	In recent years, the traditional automotive industry has also begun to enter the field of autonomous driving technology, seeking new breakthroughs. From simple pedestrian and vehicle detection, to the instance segmentation of traffic scenes, to the ideal all-intelligent driving, it has begun to be occupied by deep learning. Research scholars have tried to build a vehicle's control strategy system entirely using computers and also proposed a full convolutional neural network that replaced the fully connected structure with convolutional ideas, realizing the transition from image classification to dense pixel prediction. This is the first step for neural network to be used for scene instance segmentation, and it is also a key step for intelligent driving. However, the effect of the full convolutional neural network is not very ideal. An important problem is that the pooling layer will lose part of the location information while aggregating the background. For dense prediction of image instance segmentation, the context information (location information) of each pixel is indispensable, which is very important for the final classification of pixels. Thus, later researchers proposed three different structures to solve this problem: cavity convolution structure, codec structure, space pyramid structure. This paper analyzes the working principles and characteristics of several different structures and compares the differences between various networks. This paper combines a Mask-RCNN to construct a new network structure for image instance segmentation. The main innovations of this paper are as follows: 1. Introduce generative adversarial network into the field of image segmentation. Combine the conditional generative adversarial network idea, using the original image as the input of the generator, and the generative to generate the desired instance segmentation result. Combine the original image with the instance segmentation result generated by the generative, or combine the original image with the manually labeled segmentation result as the input to the discriminator. By training the network so that the discriminator cannot distinguish between the image generated by the generator and the result of the manual annotation, the generator can generate a satisfactory image segmentation result. 2. Introduce superpixel information of the image. In this paper, the boundary information obtained by superpixel segmentation is input into the generator network as a segmentation condition. For the original input image, this paper uses superpixel segmentation method to obtain the subtle contour of the image, and then stacks the superpixel segmentation result with the original image as the input of the generated network. 3. Reconstructed a new image segmentation structure. In the image translation model, the processing at the boundary is often difficult to achieve good results, so this article changes the output layer of the generator to K (K represents the number of classifications) channels to output the results. This paper adopts the Encoder-Decoder structure in DeconvNet, removes the full connection layer to reduce the model parameters, and changes the pooled indexing method to the direct stacking structure.	https://www.spiedigitallibrary.org/conference-proceedings-of-spie/11187/111871E/Infrared-object-image-instance-segmentation-based-on-improved-mask-RCNN/10.1117/12.2537492.pdf    https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85079041907&origin=inward	no
Robust drone detection with static VIS and SWIR cameras for day and night counter-UAV	Considerable progress with unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) has led to an increasing need for counter-UAV systems to detect present, potentially threatening or misused drones. Therefore, a UAV detection algorithm has been developped recently for day and night operation. Whereas high resolution VIS cameras enable to detect UAVs in daylight in further distances, surveillance at night is performed with a short wave infrared (SWIR) camera. The proposed method is based on temporal median computation, structural adaptive image differencing, codebook-based background learning, local density computation, and shape analysis of foreground structures to perform an improved near range change detection for UAVs. Areas with moving scene parts, like leaves in the wind or driving cars on a street, are recognized to minimize false alarms. This paper presents a significant improvement with respect to some of the most challenging tasks in this field, e.g., increasing the UAV detection sensitivity in front of trees with waving leaves, false alarm minimization, and avoiding the background model update problem. The provided results illustrate the reached performance in a variety of different situations.	https://www.spiedigitallibrary.org/conference-proceedings-of-spie/11166/111660B/Robust-drone-detection-with-static-VIS-and-SWIR-cameras-for/10.1117/12.2537940.pdf    https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85077318440&origin=inward	no

Fast detection and recognition method of UAV in sky background	With the development of science and technology, unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) is more and more widely used to bring a lot of convenience to the society, but also led to serious threats to public security, personal privacy, military security and other aspects. Therefore, it is increasingly important to find unknown drones quickly and accurately. In UAV detection, the technologies based on acoustic, radio and radar detection are common, but these technologies usually require expensive equipment and strict configuration. However, the method based on machine vision has the advantages of low cost and simple configuration. In addition, detection and recognition methods based on deep learning have been fully developed, but most of them are for a single visible image, and the detection and recognition effect is limited. In this paper, a fast detection and identification method based is proposed based on the backbone of YOLOv3 (You Only Look Once version3). And dual-channel detectors were used as data sources. In this method, infrared and visible images are simultaneously input into the network for feature extraction, and the extracted depth features are concatenated. Then the multi-scale prediction network is used to regression the target location to obtain the final detection and recognition results. Finally, by collecting real UAV data sets, the network is trained and tested for comparative experiments. Experimental results show that the mAP of method in this paper is worthy of improvement, and the detection speed remains at 27images/s.	https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85078324840&origin=inward    https://www.spiedigitallibrary.org/conference-proceedings-of-spie/11209/1120907/Fast-detection-and-recognition-method-of-UAV-in-sky-background/10.1117/12.2542273.pdf	no
Investigation of airborne synthetic aperture radar parameters for buried target detection	Explosive hazards pose a threat to both civilians and warfighters in areas of current and past conflict. The U.S. Army Combat Capabilities Development Command (CCDC) has been exploring the use of an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV)-mounted ultra-wideband (UWB) radar to image and detect obscured explosive hazards. In a stripmap modality, a synthetic aperture radar system travels in a straight line and takes measurements perpendicular to the platform’s direction of travel. The large angular diversity provided by the platform motion yields a fine cross-range resolution of the imaged scene. This problem space is being simulated in MATLAB to determine the feasibility of buried target detection and to identify the optimal parameters of operation on a UAV. Parameters such as platform height, incident angle, and bandwidth are investigated. It is shown that performance at different platform heights is determined by the dependence of the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) on elevation. Furthermore, a minimum platform height is required to meet the minimum requirements of the time-bandwidth product for pulsed waveforms. An optimal transmit angle can be found by maximizing the target-to-clutter ratio (TCR). The target radar cross section (RCS) is taken from finite-difference time-domain (FDTD) models of targets of interest, and the clutter is simulated using the small perturbation method (SPM) for distributed clutter. Finally, the required resolution and bandwidth of the system are presented.	https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85072608335&origin=inward    https://www.spiedigitallibrary.org/conference-proceedings-of-spie/11003/1100306/Investigation-of-airborne-synthetic-aperture-radar-parameters-for-buried-target/10.1117/12.2519674.pdf	no

Drones coordination protocols in the precision agriculture context	In the last years, the Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs), also known as drones, are becoming always more attractive due to their capacity of a rapid deployment and their wide range of application in many real world scenarios. Among the various fields of application, recently, the use of drones in the precision agriculture is becoming much relevant for the researchers community. The studies related to agriculture concern different aspects such as livestock monitoring, crops and water levels. The drones are able to perform these tasks thank to a series of different sensors and actuators equipped on board. Cameras on board allow, through opportune algorithms, the gathering of detailed information about plants health. If a health problem is detected then the the drone can intervene precisely on the specific problem. The contribution of this work is a communication protocols analysis applied to the problem of controlling a fleet of drones against parasites attacks to the crops. Moreover, the study of the different approaches aims to measure their performance and costs. In particular, the various approaches face also the issues of exploring the area in the shortest time possible avoiding that the same area is explored from more drones, discovering the parasites and preventing their proliferation spraying the right quantity of pesticide. The drones, being equipped with limited quantities of both fuel and pesticide, can ask for help to other drones to complete the elimination of the parasites. To face these last issues some recruitment protocols have been tested, focusing on bio-inspired one.	https://www.spiedigitallibrary.org/conference-proceedings-of-spie/11008/110080G/Drones-coordination-protocols-in-the-precision-agriculture-context/10.1117/12.2518973.pdf    https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85072643624&origin=inward	no

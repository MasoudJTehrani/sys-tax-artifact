      "abstract": "Trash bottles which are floating is one of the main causes of the worrying ecological threat posed by the developing pollution of inland water bodies. Real-time object detection algorithms in aggregation with unmanned boats can propose ways to eliminate floating trash from rivers. The study presents an extensive analysis of Faster RCNN(F-RCNN) models by applying different backbones, such as ResNet50, VGG16, DenseNet and mobileNetV3 and different optimizers such as Adam, Stochastic gradient descent for bottle identification in inland water. FloW_Img [1] is a dataset of floating trash in the river, and the performance metrics like mean average precision(mAP), recall and precision are used, to compare and experimentally validate each algorithm's detection efficiency and accuracy. The approach trains each architecture for 40 epochs. Regarding the precision of detection, the experimental results shows that F-RCNN with resnet50 as a backbone and Stochastic gradient descent (SGD) optimizer has high detection mean average precision (mAP) with mAP@[IoU=0.5] of 18%",

      "abstract": "A method for differentiating marine oil slicks from radar-dark, low-wind areas in open water using rapid-repeat synthetic aperture radar (SAR) imagery is reported. The study uses data acquired by the airborne NASA unmanned aerial vehicle SAR (UAVSAR) L-band SAR instrument, imaging the Coal Oil Point seep field near Santa Barbara, California. Time series of images from three different days are analyzed, all containing both verified oil slicks and low-wind zones. We propose a method to derive high-confidence oil/open water maps by exploiting the differences in spatial and temporal evolution between the low-wind zones and oil slicks over time scales of \u223c1\u20133.5 h. Our method uses the standard deviation of the backscatter intensity for ensembles of colocated SAR pixels and is sufficiently simple and generic to be applied to near-real-time and without special processing code. The derived maps are compared with images of the ocean surface obtained by cameras mounted on a boat surveying the seep field simultaneously with the SAR. The imagery is manually classified into confirmed oil, likely oil, and open water classes. Our results show \u223c1\u20137 dB difference between the SAR-derived mean standard deviation values of the confirmed/likely oil classes compared with the open water class. The minimum number of scenes needed to distinguish between areas of high likelihood of open water and oil slick was determined to be 3\u20135 scenes, spanning 50\u201380 min, depending on the spatial extent and persistence of the low-wind zones in the imagery.",

      "abstract": "In 1992, when Rip van Winkle\u2019s (RvW) cipher was first proposed, the needed infinite public source wasn\u2019t practically available yet, and demands for large buffer memory were too high. Nowadays, with many different satellites orbiting the Earth and transmitting terabytes of digital data daily, its feasible implementations can be worked out. New security-critical systems like unmanned ships and submarines or electrical vehicle (EV) charging stations need to be properly protected, because of danger of possible remote hijacking attacks. Security of present standard encryption methods like AES or RSA has already been disputed. In the wake of constant development and improvements on quantum computers and code-breaking algorithms specifically designed for them, stronger encryption methods need to be devised. This paper presents a method of practical implementation of RvW cipher, with several thousand bits strong symmetric encryption keys regenerated daily. The mathematical simplicity and provable strength of one-time pad (OTP) cipher, combined with simple key generation and synchronization method (with both forward and backward security), using one-way simplex broadcast communication only, will provide much stronger encryption.",

      "abstract": "As an important ocean dynamic process, internal waves (IWs) have a remarkable effect on sediment resuspension and ocean mixing, and also seriously threaten oil rig operation and the navigability of underwater submarines. Synthetic aperture radar (SAR) is an advanced tool widely applied for IW observation due to its all-weather observation capability. However, complex atmospheric and oceanic environments can obstruct the IW structures in SAR single-channel images, and accurate automated extraction still limits the application of SAR-based IW detection from complex oceanic backgrounds. This study proposes a novel automatic extraction method for IWs to address this problem. The main innovations for accurate IW extraction with SAR data are highlighted as follows. 1) Polarimetric SAR images, which contain more information to characterize IWs, are utilized. 2) An attention-based U-Net is proposed to achieve better feature-focusing capabilities of the IW extraction network. 3) A multiscale loss function is proposed to improve the accuracy of the IW extraction network. We create an IW dataset that contains 1008 scenes of Sentinel-1 images and 10 686 IW crests in the Indo-Pacific warm pool. Experimentally, the proposed method achieves good completeness, correctness, and F1 scores of 94.54%, 81.43%, and 87.50%, respectively, which are significantly higher than other methods. Further experiments indicated that the trained IW extraction network shows satisfactory applicability and accuracy for different test areas and various SAR data. The proposed method has great potential applications for performing ocean/global scale monitoring and statistical analysis of IWs.",

      "abstract": "Due to the efficiency and reliability of delivering goods by ships, maritime transport has been the backbone of global trade. In normal circumstances, a ship\u00e2\u0080\u0099s voyage is expected to assure the safety of life at sea, efficient and safe navigation, and protection of the maritime environment. However, ships may demonstrate unexpected behavior due to certain situations, such as machinery malfunction, unexpected bad weather, and other emergencies, as well as involvement in illicit activities. These situations pose threats to the safety and security of maritime transport. The expansion of the threats makes manual surveillance inefficient, which involves extensive labor and is prone to oversight. Thus, automated surveillance systems are required. This paper proposes a method to detect the unexpected behavior of ships based on the Automatic Identification System (AIS) data. The method exploits the geometrical features of AIS-generated trajectories to identify unexpected trajectory, which could be a deviation from the common routes, loitering, or both deviating and loitering. It introduces novel formulas for calculating trajectory redundancy and curvature features. The DBSCAN clustering is applied based on the features to classify trajectories as expected or unexpected. Unlike existing methods, the proposed technique does not require trajectory-to-image conversion or training of labeled datasets. The technique was tested on real-world AIS data from the South China Sea, Western Indonesia, Singapore, and Malaysian waters between July 2021 and February 2022. The experimental results demonstrate the method\u00e2\u0080\u0099s feasibility in detecting deviating and loitering behaviors. Evaluation on a labeled dataset shows superior performance compared to existing loitering detection methods across multiple metrics, with 99% accuracy and 100% precision in identifying loitering trajectories. The proposed method aims to provide maritime authorities and fleet owners with an efficient tool for monitoring ship behaviors in real time regarding safety, security, and economic concerns.",

      "abstract": "The integration of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) and marine communication networks has been emerging as a promising paradigm to cater for the growing maritime activities, e.g., marine environment monitoring and ocean resource exploration. The increasing growth of marine applications and services poses challenges for processing marine data, while the resources-limited UAVs cannot satisfy the requirements of computing-intensive and energy consumption. In this paper, we consider a marine edge computing scenario with a group of UAVs and ocean beacon stations (OBSs) and propose a multi-UAV aided multi-access edge computing for marine networks from the perspective of system-welfare and energy-efficient design. Specifically, we propose a multi-task multi-access offloading scheme in marine edge computing networks, in which multiple UAVs can process their workloads locally or offload their partial workloads to multiple OBSs for processing. We consider the total utilities for completing all tasks as the system welfare, and measure the difference between the system welfare and energy consumption as the system revenue. A joint optimization problem is formulated by optimizing the OBS selection, the offloading ratio and the transmission duration, with the objective of increasing the system revenue in marine edge computing networks. We exploit a vertical decomposition architecture to solve the formulated non-convex problem via decomposing it into three sub-problems. Regarding each sub-problem, we propose efficient algorithms to derive the optimal solutions. We finally conduct simulations to verify the performance of the proposed algorithms. The results demonstrate that our proposed algorithms can achieve the best performance for improving the system revenue in comparison with several benchmark algorithms.",

      "abstract": "For maritime autonomous surface ships (MASS), challenges exist in visual detection of occluded marine vessels since invisible occlusion is required to be inferred from locally unoccluded features which are weakly related to the entirety. In this paper, an attention-aware occlusion detection scheme of marine vessels, termed AodeMar, is originated from the viewpoint of MASS transportation. To this end, a position enhancement module is created by virtue of residual connections and coordinate attentions such that high-level semantics and spatial feature dependencies can be efficiently exploited, respectively, thereby accurately locating bounding boxes. Moreover, a multi-scale feature semantics correlation block is devised by combining spatial pyramid pooling and swin transformer-based self-attention encoder in order that the classification ability can be fertilized in both global and local sense. Experiments and comparisons show that the proposed AodeMar outperforms typical approaches including Faster R-CNN, SSD and YOLO series in terms of detection accuracy and robustness.",

      "abstract": "Increasingly disruptive cyber-attacks in the maritime domain have led to more efforts being focused on enhancing cyber resilience. From a regulatory perspective, there is a requirement that maritime stakeholders implement measures that would enable the timely detection of cyber events, leading to the adoption of Maritime Security Operation Centers (M-SOCs). At the same time, Remote Operation Centers (ROCs) are also being discussed to enable increased adoption of highly automated and autonomous technologies, which could further impact the attack surface of vessels. The main objective of this research was therefore to better understand both enabling factors and challenges impacting the effectiveness of M-SOC operations. Semi-structured interviews were conducted with nine M-SOC experts. Informed by grounded theory, incident management emerged as the core category. By focusing on the factors that make M-SOC operations a unique undertaking, the main contribution of this study is that it highlights how maritime connectivity challenges and domain knowledge impact the M-SOC incident management process. Additionally, we have related the findings to a future where M-SOC and ROC operations could be converged.",

      "abstract": "The ocean economy serves as a critical engine for the development of human society and economy, and its stable growth is of utmost importance. However, the frequent and unexpected occurrence of natural disasters such as Submarine disasters poses significant threats to human society, especially disasters related to wave phenomena like the Ekman current, which have particularly prominent impacts. Therefore, the present study proposes a dynamic routing scheme for underwater acoustic sensor networks. This scheme establishes a Cone-shaped distributed network, utilizing autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs) to collect crucial data from nodes deployed on the seabed and transmit it through the underwater cone-shaped distributed sensor network. This approach significantly reduces the frequency of routing information exchange and energy consumption among acoustic sensors, effectively enhancing the economy and durability of the sensor network. Additionally, it adopts SLP (source location protection) technology to ensure the privacy of source locations. To validate the practicality and stability of this scheme, simulation experiments targeting the Ekman current were conducted in MATLAB. The experimental results demonstrate that the Cone-SLP network exhibits strong practicality and high stability in complex and variable submarine environments. This research not only provides a practical method for effectively monitoring submarine disasters but also offers valuable experience and significant reference value for other similar projects, playing a more crucial role in the sustainable development of the ocean economy.",

      "abstract": "In maritime logistics optimization, considerable research efforts are focused on the extraction of deep behavioral characteristics from comprehensive shipping data to discern patterns in maritime vessel behavior. The effective linkage of these characteristics with maritime infrastructure, such as berths, is critical for the enhancement of ship navigation systems. This endeavor is paramount not only as a research focus within maritime information science but also for the progression of intelligent maritime systems. Traditional methodologies have primarily emphasized the analysis of navigational paths of vessels without an extensive consideration of the geographical dynamics between ships and port infrastructure. However, the introduction of knowledge graphs has enabled the integration of disparate data sources, facilitating new insights that propel the development of intelligent maritime systems. This manuscript presents a novel framework using knowledge graph technology for profound analysis of maritime data. Utilizing automatic identification system (AIS) data alongside spatial information from port facilities, the framework forms semantic triplet connections among ships, anchorages, berths, and waterways. This enables the semantic modeling of maritime behaviors, offering precise identification of ships through their diverse semantic information. Moreover, by exploiting the semantic relations between ships and berths, a reverse semantic knowledge graph for berths is constructed, which is specifically tailored to ship type, size, and category. The manuscript critically evaluates a range of graph embedding techniques, dimensionality reduction methods, and classification strategies through experimental frameworks to determine the most efficacious methodologies. The findings reveal that the maritime knowledge graph significantly enhances the semantic understanding of unmanned maritime equipment, thereby improving decision-making capabilities. Additionally, it establishes a semantic foundation for the development of expansive maritime models, illustrating the potential of knowledge graph technology in advancing intelligent maritime systems.",

      "abstract": "The vast and dynamic maritime domain demands constant observance and accurate information for successful naval operations. However, traditional methods struggle to keep pace with the ever-increasing complexity and data overflow. The paper explores how Artificial Intelligence (AI) presents a transformative opportunity, significantly impacting naval operation by enhancing Situational awareness (SA) and Threat monitoring (TM). It is analyzed the impact of AI across three key areas: enhanced data processing and analysis, improved anomaly detection and predictive capabilities, and real-time decision support. By analyzing key principles, tactics, and procedures for AI implementation, it is explored the process how these capabilities can convert into practical applications and benefits. Examples like AI-powered maritime surveillance and predictive systems for naval assets demonstrate solid benefits of this technological progress. Additionally, in the paper are envisioned future operational scenarios where AI-driven autonomous systems and dynamic route optimization become commonplace. The analysis demonstrates how AI can be a critical factor in moving naval operations into a new era of efficiency and proactive threat management. However, responsible development and ethical considerations remain of paramount importance.",

      "abstract": " The ability to take advantage of new digital solutions and technology will give companies a competitive edge, and operational optimization remains a major concern. A significant area of risk is cyber security because software-based technologies are integral to ship operations. Particular emphasis has been placed on the vulnerabilities of the Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS), since it is an essential part of many maritime facilities and hence a target for hackers. Presently, research has shown that increased integration of new enabling technologies, like the Internet of Things (IoT) and big data, is driving the dramatic proliferation of cybercrimes. However, most of the attacks are related to ransomware attacks and/or with direct attack to the information technology (IT) and infrastructure. Nevertheless, there is a strong trend toward increased systems integration, which will produce substantial business value by making it easier to operate autonomous vessels, utilizing smart ports more, reducing the need for labour, and improving economic stability and service efficiency. Cybersecurity is becoming more and more important as a result of the quick digital transformation of the offshore and maritime sectors, which has also brought new dangers and laws. The marine sector has started to take cybersecurity seriously in light of the multiple documented instances of cyberattacks that have exposed business or personal data, caused large financial losses, and caused other problems. However, the body of existing research on emerging threats in maritime cyberspace is either inadequate or ignores important variables. Based on the most recent developments in the maritime sector, the article presents a classification of the most serious cyberthreats as well as the risks to cybersecurity in maritime operations and possible mitigation strategies from an educational research perspective.

      "abstract": "Invasive insects threaten ecosystem stability, public health, and food security. Documenting newly invasive species and understanding how they reach into new territories, establish populations, and interact with other species remain vitally important. Here, we report on the invasion of the South American leafhopper, Curtara insularis into Africa, where it has established populations in Ghana, encroaching inland at least 350 km off the coast. Importantly, 80% of the specimens collected were intercepted between 160 and 190 m above ground. Further, the fraction of this species among all insects collected was also higher at altitude, demonstrating its propensity to engage in high-altitude windborne dispersal. Its aerial densities at altitude translate into millions of migrants/km over a year, representing massive propagule pressure. Given the predominant south-westerly winds, these sightings suggest an introduction of C. insularis into at least one of the Gulf of Guinea ports. To assess the contribution of windborne dispersal to its spread in a new territory, we examine records of C. insularis range-expansion in the USA. Reported first in 2004 from central Florida, it reached north Florida (Panhandle) by 2008\u20132011 and subsequently spread across the southeastern and south-central US. Its expansion fits a \u201cdiffusion-like\u201d process with 200\u2014300 km long \u201cannual displacement steps\u201d\u2014a pattern consistent with autonomous dispersal rather than vehicular transport. Most \u201csteps\u201d are consistent with common wind trajectories from the nearest documented population, assuming 2\u20148 hours of wind-assisted flight at altitude. Curtara insularis has been intercepted at US ports and on trucks. Thus, it uses multiple dispersal modalities, yet its rapid overland spread is better explained by its massive propagule pressure linked with its high-altitude windborne dispersal. We propose that high-altitude windborne dispersal is common yet under-appreciated in invasive insect species.",

The result confirmed that automated and continuous&nbsp;monitoring of the ship\u2019s cybersecurity status of core assets is vital. It was determined that approximately&nbsp;40% of potential cyber-attacks could be eliminated with cybersecurity management procedures andcrew training for this specific training ship. Additionally, it was confirmed that the applied risk&nbsp;assessment methodology could be reasonably applied to this type of study.",

      "abstract": "The safety of ship navigation has always been a focus of attention in the field of maritime transport and navigation. In the complex marine environment, ships face a variety of obstacles, such as other ships, reefs, buoys, etc., which may pose a threat to navigation safety. Traditional obstacle avoidance methods mainly rely on the navigator's empirical judgement, but there are limitations and risks associated with this method. The standard ant colony optimisation algorithm tends to fall into local optimal solutions during path search, while the A* algorithm is easily limited by the search space when dealing with large-scale problems. Therefore, the study proposes a method that combines a heuristic search algorithm and an improved ACO algorithm to improve the efficiency of obstacle avoidance for vessel navigation safety. Firstly, the standard ant colony optimisation algorithm is improved and applied to the study of obstacle avoidance paths for vessel navigation, and then the A* algorithm is effectively combined with the improved ACO algorithm to improve the performance of planning obstacle avoidance paths. Through simulation experiments and practical applications, the study verifies the capability of the obstacle avoidance planning model. The experimental results show that in simple environments, the hybrid algorithm reduces the path length by 3.8 and 5.5, and the number of iterations by 13.2 and 30.7 compared to Line-of-Sight and Particle Swarm Optimisation algorithms respectively. In moderately complex environments, the proposed algorithm reduces the average path length by 6.51 and 3.93 compared to Particle Swarm Optimisation and Line-of-Sight algorithms respectively. In complex environments, the proposed algorithm reduces the average path length by 15.7 and 12.4 compared to Particle Swarm Optimisation and Line-of-Sight algorithms, and reduces the number of iterations by 49 and 22.2, respectively. The study proposes a novel obstacle avoidance path planning method by effectively integrating the improved ant colony algorithm with the A* algorithm, which significantly improves the efficiency and accuracy of vessel navigation safety. The results show that the hybrid algorithm exhibits superior path planning capability in environments of varying complexity, and is able to quickly adapt to dynamically changing marine environments. This method not only provides a new solution for navigation safety, but also provides a theoretical basis and practical guidance for future autonomous navigation and decision-making of intelligent ships, which has important application value and promotion potential.",

      "abstract": "Adversarial examples represent a serious threat for deep neural networks in several application domains and a huge amount of work has been produced to investigate them and mitigate their effects. Nevertheless, no much work has been devoted to the generation of datasets specifically designed to evaluate the adversarial robustness of neural models. This paper presents CARLA-GeAR, a tool for the automatic generation of photo-realistic synthetic datasets related to driving scenarios that can be used for a systematic evaluation of the adversarial robustness of neural models against physical adversarial patches, as well as for comparing the performance of different adversarial defense/detection methods. The tool is built on the CARLA simulator, using its Python API, and allows the generation of datasets for several vision tasks in the context of autonomous driving. The adversarial patches included in the generated datasets are attached to billboards or the back of a truck and are crafted by using state-of-the-art white-box attack strategies to maximize the prediction error of the model under test. Finally, the paper presents an experimental study to evaluate the performance of some defense methods against such attacks, showing how the datasets generated with CARLA-GeAR might be used in future work as a benchmark for adversarial defense in the real world. All the code and datasets used in this paper are available at https://carlagear.retis.santannapisa.it.",

      "abstract": "With the evolutional development of maritime networks, the explosive growth of maritime data has put forward elevated demands for the computing capabilities of maritime devices (MDs). Unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) is able to alleviate the computing pressure of MDs by forwarding the computing tasks to the edge server on the coast. However, UAV relaying introduces a significant security challenge due to the vulnerability of line-of-sight (LoS) communication channels, which can be exploited for eavesdropping on computing tasks. In this paper, an efficient secure communication scheme is proposed for UAV-relay-assisted maritime mobile edge computing (MEC) with a flying eavesdropper. The secure computing capacity of MDs is maximized by jointly optimizing the transmit power, time slot allocation factor, computation optimization and UAV trajectory. Due to multi-variable coupling, the formulated optimization problem (OP) is non-convex. We first transform OP by introducing auxiliary variables. Then, the transformed OP is decomposed and solved in an iterative manner by applying block coordinate descent (BCD) and successive convex approximation (SCA). Numerical results show that the secure computing capability of the UAV-relay-assisted maritime MEC system of proposed secure communication scheme can be effectively improved compared with benchmarks.",

      "abstract": "With the rapid development of maritime activities, efficient and reliable maritime communications have attracted ever-increasing attention, and mounting reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS) on unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV), called UAV-RIS, can provide flexible and adaptable services for maritime communications. In this paper, we investigate a UAV-RIS-assisted maritime communication system under a malicious jammer, where a UAV-RIS is deployed to jointly adjust its placement and RIS surface elements to maximize the system energy efficiency (EE) and guarantee quality of service requirements against jamming attacks. In addition, an adaptive energy harvesting scheme is developed for information transmission (IT) and energy harvesting (EH) simultaneously to enhance the endurance of the UAV by deploying different IT times for each RIS element. Considering the non-convex optimization problem and highly complex maritime environments, an intelligent resource management approach based on deep reinforcement learning is proposed to jointly optimize the base station\u2019s transmit power, placement of UAV-RIS, and RISs reflecting beamforming. Furthermore, hindsight experience replay is adopted to improve the learning efficiency and performance. The simulation results demonstrate that the proposed approach achieves the better EE and EH performances under different real-world settings compared with existing popular approaches.",

Firstly, an adaptive memory-based event-triggering communication mechanism (METCM) is designed to save networked resources in maritime environment. Second, the signals released by the communication mechanism are quantized to further reduce the bandwidth of the communication network. In addition, since adversary may have multiple attack strategies, thus a hierarchical semi-Markov process (HS-MP) is presented to capture the phenomenon of switching DoS attacks, which makes the attack model more realistic. Further, sufficient conditions are proposed for the finite-time boundedness (FTB) of the UMV system and some linear matrix inequalities are solved to determine the finite-time bounded controller gain. Finally, the effectiveness of the proposed control method is demonstrated by a simulation example.",

The majority of traditional pursuit methods are based on known environmental dynamics. However, the underwater environment is too complicated and unpredictable to describe these dynamics accurately. This study developed a novel online decision-making technique called multi-agent distributional soft actor-critic (MADA) to handle the issue of underwater cooperative pursuit. The method constructs a control-oriented framework based on multi-agent reinforcement learning that can map autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV) observations to pursuit actions. Multiple AUVs can combine to make prompt pursuit decisions. Then, the proposed method combines distributional soft actor-critic and curriculum learning to improve the success rates of multiple AUVs in pursuing UUVs. Experimental results show that the MADA can obtain a better cooperative pursuit strategy.",

Model-based methods are highly relying on the understanding of human knowledge to ships. Data-driven models also provide promising solutions, but their generalization is low. To address this challenge, a semi-supervised transfer learning approach for SSE (SAFENESS) is proposed. The model is trained using sufficient data in the source ship and limited data from the target ship and finally applied to the target ship. A data alignment algorithm is utilized to use the limited data of the target ship. To enhance the learning capability of the framework, two attention mechanisms are proposed, and a multi-class adversarial discriminator is introduced that can align the distributions of different domains. The effectiveness of our approach is validated through comprehensive comparisons with eleven established transfer learning methods, demonstrating the superiority of our model. The competitiveness of the proposed attention modules is verified by comparing them with state-of-the-art attention modules. The significance of each component and the influence of key parameters have been thoroughly explored in the ablation and sensitivity analysis. Our method has potential applications in maritime safety, navigation, and operation optimization.",

      "abstract": "3D object perception in maritime is a promising means to enhance the ability of the autonomous navigation. However, 3D automatic reconstruction of dynamic targets remains a challenging task in the 3D object perception systems. In this paper, we present an innovative GAN-based deep learning neural network for 3D ship reconstruction. The method is able to reconstruct 3D ship models from single view images or videos using shape prior knowledge and a vessel generative adversarial network (Vessel-GAN), which can effectively extract the ship shape features from the single-view images or videos. Furthermore, a 3D feature network optimization model is proposed for loop optimization of 3D ship shape perception. In order to validate the effectiveness of the proposed method, a high resolution single ship dataset (HSSD) was created, and the performance of the proposed method was evaluated against the existing methods, The experimental results show that the Vessel Segment Network (VSNet) can improve the accuracy of the HSSD dataset by 2.5% in the single ship segmentation tasks. In addition, Vessel-GAN was demonstrated to be able to generate multi-view ship images with an impressive FID value of 5.82. Moreover, our model can improve the accuracy of 3D ship modeling by 8.9% on the ShapeNet dataset. This innovative approach promises to enable 3D perception of the marine environment for autonomous ship.",

The RIS is installed on an Unmanned surface vehicle (USV) to construct a RIS-assisted USV relay communication system, which mitigates jamming attacks while enhancing legitimate transmissions. Compared to traditional static RIS, the use of mobile USV with RIS enables better performance and greater flexibility. We jointly optimize the trajectory of the USV, the passive beamforming of the RIS, and the source power allocation for each time slot based on proximal policy optimization (PPO), aiming to maximize the average downlink throughput. Simulation results demonstrate that the deployment of RIS on USV effectively suppresses jamming attacks and protects legitimate transmissions.",

      "abstract": "As robots acquire increasingly sophisticated skills and see increasingly complex and varied environments, the threat of an edge case or anomalous failure is ever present. For example, Tesla cars have seen interesting failure modes ranging from autopilot disengagements due to inactive traffic lights carried by trucks to phantom braking caused by images of stop signs on roadside billboards. These system-level failures are not due to failures of any individual component of the autonomy stack but rather system-level deficiencies in semantic reasoning. Such edge cases, which we call semantic anomalies, are simple for a human to disentangle yet require insightful reasoning. To this end, we study the application of large language models (LLMs), endowed with broad contextual understanding and reasoning capabilities, to recognize such edge cases and introduce a monitoring framework for semantic anomaly detection in vision-based policies. Our experiments apply this framework to a finite state machine policy for autonomous driving and a learned policy for object manipulation. These experiments demonstrate that the LLM-based monitor can effectively identify semantic anomalies in a manner that shows agreement with human reasoning. Finally, we provide an extended discussion on the strengths and weaknesses of this approach and motivate a research outlook on how we can further use foundation models for semantic anomaly detection.

      "abstract": "With the increasingly maturing technology of unmanned surface vehicles (USVs), their applications are becoming more and more widespread. In order to meet operational requirements in complex scenarios, the real-time interaction and linkage of a large amount of information is required between USVs, between USVs and mother ships, and between USVs and shore-based monitoring systems. Visual images are the main perceptual information gathered from USVs, and their efficient transmission and recognition directly affect the real-time performance of information exchange. However, poor maritime communication signals, strong channel interference, and low bandwidth pose great challenges to efficient image transmission. Traditional image transmission methods have difficulty meeting the real-time and image quality requirements of visual image transmissions from USVs. Therefore, this paper proposes an efficient method for visual image transmission from USVs based on semantic communication. A self-encoder network for semantic encoding which compresses the image into low-dimensional latent semantics through the encoding end, thereby preserving semantic information while greatly reducing the amount of data transmitted, is designed. On the other hand, a generative adversarial network is designed for semantic decoding. The decoding end decodes and reconstructs high-quality images from the semantic information transmitted through the channel, thereby improving the efficiency of image transmission. The experimental results show that the performance of the algorithm is significantly superior to traditional image transmission methods, achieving the best image quality while transmitting the minimum amount of data. Compared with the typical BPG algorithm, when the compression ratio of the proposed algorithm is 51.6% of that of the BPG algorithm, the PSNR and SSIM values are 7.6% and 5.7% higher than the BPG algorithm, respectively. And the average total time of the proposed algorithm is only 59.4% of that of the BPG algorithm.",

      "abstract": "Automated surveillance systems are becoming a critical requirement in maritime domain, due to the continuous expansion of maritime security threats. Although several automated systems have been developed, detection of maritime threats is becoming more challenging due to the constantly changing tactics adopted by seafarers to evade detection. Machine learning algorithms are a popular choice when detecting maritime threats based on the abnormalities of vessels. This paper categorizes the security threats according to three processing levels: abnormal activities, behaviors, and intents, and presents available machine learning techniques to detect these threats, including several deep learning techniques which is the current trend in detecting abnormalities. Supervised learning and unsupervised learning techniques used in the literature are discussed in this paper, where the advantages and disadvantages of each approach in the context of maritime surveillance are discussed in detail. Supervised learning was used predominantly for detecting relatively simple abnormal behaviors and intents such as movement abnormalities. Such learning methods yielded higher accuracy values in comparison to unsupervised learning methods, which achieved 80\u201395% accuracy. Supervised learning methods perform between 93 and 99% accuracy, where the highest accuracy is achieved by SVM (support vector machine) and 91% accuracy by CNN (convolutional neural network) as the best among deep learning methods. Furthermore, this analysis reveals that supervised deep learning methods such as CNN and long short-term memory (LSTM) will be the future trends in developing high-accurate maritime surveillance systems with the ability to detect more maritime threats.",

      "abstract": "The rise of the Internet of Things (IoT) has opened up exciting possibilities for new applications. One such novel application is the modernization of maritime communications. Effective maritime communication is vital for ensuring the safety of crew members, vessels, and cargo. The maritime industry is responsible for the transportation of a significant portion of global trade, and as such, the efficient and secure transfer of information is essential to maintain the flow of goods and services. With the increasing complexity of maritime operations, technological advancements such as unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs), and the Internet of Ships (IoS) have been introduced to enhance communication and operational efficiency. However, these technologies also bring new challenges in terms of security and network management. Compromised IT systems, with escalated privileges, can potentially enable easy and ready access to operational technology (OT) systems and networks with the same privileges, with an increased risk of zero-day attacks. In this paper, we first provide a review of the current state and modalities of maritime communications. We then review the current adoption of software-defined radios (SDRs) and software-defined networks (SDNs) in the maritime industry and evaluate their impact as maritime IoT enablers. Finally, as a key contribution of this paper, we propose a unified SDN\u2013SDR-driven cross-layer communications framework that leverages the existing SATCOM communications infrastructure, for improved and resilient maritime communications in highly dynamic and resource-constrained environments.",

      "abstract": "Selective promotion entails the exploitation of resources offered by individual complementors to improve a proprietary platform\u2019s competitive position. However, as governance decisions to endorse a particular complementor are made unilaterally, such promotion is less suitable for shared platforms that are ultimately owned and managed by an ecosystem of heterogeneous, autonomous complementors. We explore compatibility promotion, which involves screening a shared stock of infrastructural resources and making a choice as to which complementor to promote in light of the capabilities the platform seeks to develop. Based on a longitudinal study of a shared platform that evolved around a new technology standard in the Swedish road haulage industry, we explicate how elevating one complementor over others unsettled the governance of the platform and denied the promoted complementors the opportunity to generate the kind of value that their elevated status implicitly promised. This made the platform better off at the expense of the promoted complementor. Our surprising insight lets us theorize why compatibility promotion in shared platforms renders outcomes opposite to those of selective promotion in proprietary platforms.",

      "abstract": "Reliable anti-collision control algorithms conforming with the rules regulating traffic at sea, the International Regulations for Preventing Collisions at Sea (COLREG), are essential for the deployment of autonomous vessels in waters shared with other ships. The development of such methods is an active field of research. However, little attention has been given to how these rules are interpreted by experienced mariners, and how such information can be parametrised for use in automatic control systems and autonomous ships. This paper presents a method for exploiting historical automatic identification system (AIS) data to characterise parameters indicating the prevalent practices at sea in encounters with high collision risk. The method has been tested on data gathered in areas off the Norwegian coast over several years. Statistics on relevant parameters from the resulting dataset and the relation between them is presented. The results indicate that the strongest influence on vessel behaviour is the type of situation, and the amount of land and grounding hazards in the vessel's proximity.",

      "abstract": "Maritime ship detection plays a crucial role in smart ships and intelligent transportation systems. However, adverse maritime weather conditions, such as rain streak and fog, can significantly impair the performance of visual systems for maritime traffic. These factors constrain the performance of traffic monitoring systems and ship-detection algorithms for autonomous ship navigation, affecting maritime safety. The paper proposes an approach to resolve the problem by visually removing rain streaks and fog from images, achieving an integrated framework for accurate ship detection. Firstly, the paper employs an attention generation network within an adversarial neural network to focus on the distorted regions of the degraded images. The paper also utilizes a contextual encoder to infer contextual information within the distorted regions, enhancing the credibility of image restoration. Secondly, a weighted bidirectional feature pyramid network (BiFPN) is introduced to achieve rapid multi-scale feature fusion, enhancing the accuracy of maritime ship detection. The proposed GYB framework was validated using the SeaShip dataset. The experimental results show that the proposed framework achieves an average accuracy of 96.3%, a recall of 95.35%, and a harmonic mean of 95.85% in detecting maritime traffic ships under rain-streak and foggy-weather conditions. Moreover, the framework outperforms state-of-the-art ship detection methods in such challenging weather scenarios.",

      "abstract": "In recent years, the field of underwater robotics has experienced significant growth, particularly in the area of Autonomous Underwater Vehicles (AUVs). These unmanned systems have a wide range of applications in both civilian and military contexts. For instance, AUVs can be used to monitor the environment, study marine life, and oversee offshore installations in the civil sector. In the military domain, they support Naval Units by assisting in activities such as mine countermeasure missions, discovering underwater targets, and protecting ports. In the context in which a maritime robotics research centre has the mandate to operate, above all in a challenging environment as the underwater is (often compared to space), it is crucial to have access to digital simulation tools. These tools can be used as testbed in various stages of an autonomous robot mission and during the development phase. In the initial planning phase, they can aid optimising mission preparation. During the mission, they can generate real-time simulations and report on the status of the robot, as well as the data gathered in the field, within a digital environment supporting also the augmented reality. After the mission is complete, a simulator can be utilized for post-analysis or staff training purposes. The purpose of this study is to showcase the benefits of utilizing a specially designed simulator for underwater robotics, with a focus on autonomous mission planning in the framework of monitoring the seafloor. This will be possible by exploiting the peculiarities of a simulator created for the field of underwater robotics. The study will analyze the results obtained from using this simulator to plan a specific underwater mission. The simulator being used is a \"interoperable\" type, which conforms to the IEEE 1516-2010 standard (STANAG 4603). The simulator is part of a national project called CHOBIN, which aims to provide the Italian Navy with a comprehensive tool for testing, evaluating, verifying, and analyzing complex scenarios involving systems and platforms in a realistic world model.",

      "abstract": "With the progression of marine exploration and exploitation, as well as the advancements in mechanical intelligence, the utilization of the unmanned surface vehicle (USV) and the design of their guidance system have become prominent areas of focus. However, the stern ramp recovery of the USV is still in its infancy due to its unique attitude requirements and automation design. Furthermore, few studies have addressed the impact of maritime disturbances, with most research limited to simulations. To enhance the efficiency and accuracy of stern ramp recovery, this paper presents the development and construction of a novel recovery system. By incorporating physical modeling of disturbance forces acting on USVs at sea, the practicality of the system is improved. Additionally, an optimized genetic algorithm is introduced in the navigation module to improve convergence rates and subsequently enhance recovery efficiency. A line-of-sight (LOS) algorithm based on average velocity is proposed in this paper to ensure the attainment of unique attitude requirements and to improve the effectiveness of stern chute recovery. This paper provides a detailed description of the independently designed USV hardware system. Moreover, simulations and practical experiments conducted using this experimental platform are presented, offering a new solution for the USV\u2019s stern ramp recovery.",

      "abstract": "Collisions between ships seriously threaten the safety of maritime traffic. Meanwhile, more than 80% of maritime accidents are related to human factors. To realize the autonomous collision avoidance of Unmanned Surface Vehicles (USVs), in this paper, we propose an autonomous collision avoidance method based on Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL). Firstly, in order to enable the ship to take collision avoidance actions at the appropriate time and reach the target point as soon as possible, two navigation states are determined based on Quaternion Ship Domain (QSD), that is, the goal-oriented state and the collision avoidance state. Then, we design different state spaces for dynamic and static obstacles to reduce the input of redundant information and speed up the convergence of the algorithm. In addition, COLREGs and navigation practices are taken into account when designing the reward function, so that the agent\u2019s operation is consistent with good seamanship. Finally, on the basis of the Deep Q Network (DQN), the most representative algorithm in DRL, we design experiments of static obstacle scenarios and a variety of dynamic encounter scenarios to test the rationality and effectiveness of the algorithm. The experimental results show that the USV can reach the target point without collision by using the algorithm proposed in this paper, and the decision made by the USV conforms to COLEREGs and navigation experience. This indicates that the proposed algorithm can provide support for ship autonomous collision avoidance decision-making.",

      "abstract": "Autonomous collision avoidance has received numerous attentions in recent years due to the focus on Maritime Autonomous Surface Ships (MASS). As a result, many algorithms have been developed for collision avoidance (CA), and Velocity Obstacle (VO) algorithm or Collision Threat Parameter Area (CTPA) is one popular algorithm for CA in recent years due to its simple form and low communication burden. However, since it does not consider global information, the VO algorithm might lead to deadlocks in congested waters. To solve this problem, a distributed collaboration scheme for multi-ship collision avoidance is proposed. The ships are assumed to share their navigation information including their possible trajectories in the future. Then, each ship calculates its Available Maneuvering Margin (AMM) at present, a potential collision-free course using the VO algorithm, and the expected AMM adopting the collision-free course. Based on the differences between the expected AMM and the original AMM, the priorities of taking evasive actions are determined. By utilizing AMM-ascending and AMM-descending orders to determine the decision-making sequence of ships, the probability of deadlock occurrence can be reduced. To demonstrate the proposed collaboration scheme, some experiments are introduced, and the performance of the original VO algorithm and the VO with the proposed collaboration scheme are compared. The proposed scheme is expected to reduce the deadlock using the original VO algorithm and reduce the communication burden in multi-ship collaborative collision avoidance, which would improve the safety and efficiency of shipping in congested waters.",

This study proposed and compared three remote sensing methods based on structure-from-motion (SfM) photogrammetry or stereorestitution: boat-based SfM photogrammetry with smartphones, unmanned aerial system (UAS) or unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) photogrammetry with centimetric positioning and Pl\u00e9iades tri-stereo imagery. An inter-comparison showed that the mean distance between the point clouds produced by the different methods was about 2 m. The satellite approach had the advantage of covering greater distances. The SfM photogrammetry approach from a boat allowed for a better reconstruction of the cliff foot (especially in the case of overhangs). However, over long distances, significant geometric distortions affected the method. The UAS with centimetric positioning offered a good compromise, but flight autonomy limited the extent of the monitored area. SfM photogrammetry from a boat can be used as an initial estimate for risk management services following a localized emergency. For long-term monitoring of the coastline and its evolution, satellite photogrammetry is recommended.",

      "abstract": "The entropy-oriented approach called security- or cybersecurity-informed safety (SIS or CSIS, respectively) is discussed and developed in order to analyse and evaluate the safety and dependability of autonomous transport systems (ATSs) such as unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), unmanned maritime vehicles (UMVs), and satellites. This approach allows for extending and integrating the known techniques FMECA (Failure Modes, Effects, and Criticality Analysis) and IMECA (Intrusion MECA), as well as developing the new SISMECA (SIS-based Intrusion Modes, Effects, and Criticality Analysis) technique. The ontology model and templates for SISMECA implementation are suggested. The methodology of safety assessment is based on (i) the application and enhancement of SISMECA considering the particularities of various ATSs and roles of actors (regulators, developers, operators, customers); (ii) the development of a set of scenarios describing the operation of ATS in conditions of cyberattacks and physical influences; (iii) AI contribution to system protection for the analysed domains; (iv) scenario-based development and analysis of user stories related to different cyber-attacks, as well as ways to protect ATSs from them via AI means/platforms; (v) profiling of AI platform requirements by use of characteristics based on AI quality model, risk-based assessment of cyberattack criticality, and efficiency of countermeasures which actors can implement. Examples of the application of SISMECA assessment are presented and discussed.",

The proposed design features a bi-directional hull, a rudder on both ends of the vessel and a freely rotating rigid wing sail whose angle of attack is controlled by a tail rudder. The proposed method of sailing involves reversing the vessel\u2019s travel direction at every turn and is ideal for micro-scale autonomous robotic platforms as it overcomes the difficulty in turning the boat through the eye of the wind during an upwind sail. A simulation model using aerodynamic and hydrodynamic forces is developed to test the effectiveness of the proposed design and method of sailing and compared to the traditional method of sailing in station-keeping and sailing upwind scenarios. The effectiveness of the proposed method is demonstrated with a prototype model equipped with a rigid wing sail.",

      "abstract": "Bird'View (BEV) 3D Object Detection is a crucial multi-view technique for autonomous driving systems. Recently, plenty of works are proposed, following a similar paradigm consisting of three essential components, i.e., camera feature extraction, BEV feature construction, and task heads. Among the three components, BEV feature construction is BEV-specific compared with 2D tasks. Existing methods aggregate the multi-view camera features to the flattened grid in order to construct the BEV feature. However, flattening the BEV space along the height dimension fails to emphasize the informative features of different heights. For example, the barrier is located at a low height while the truck is located at a high height. In this paper, we propose a novel method named BEV Slice Attention Network (BEV-SAN) for exploiting the intrinsic characteristics of different heights. Instead of flattening the BEV space, we first sample along the height dimension to build the global and local BEV slices. Then, the features of BEV slices are aggregated from the camera features and merged by the attention mechanism. Finally, we fuse the merged local and global BEV features by a transformer to generate the final feature map for task heads. The purpose of local BEV slices is to emphasize informative heights. In order to find them, we further propose a LiDAR-guided sampling strategy to leverage the statistical distribution of LiDAR to determine the heights of local slices. Compared with uniform sampling, LiDAR-guided sampling can determine more informative heights. We conduct detailed experiments to demonstrate the effectiveness of BEV-SAN. Code will be released.",

      "abstract": "The open road poses many challenges to autonomous perception, including poor visibility from extreme weather conditions. Models trained on good-weather datasets frequently fail at detection in these out-of-distribution settings. To aid adversarial robustness in perception, we introduce WEDGE (WEather images by DALL-E GEneration): a synthetic dataset generated with a vision-language generative model via prompting. WEDGE consists of 3360 images in 16 extreme weather conditions manually annotated with 16513 bounding boxes, supporting research in the tasks of weather classification and 2D object detection. We have analyzed WEDGE from research standpoints, verifying its effectiveness for extreme-weather autonomous perception. We establish baseline performance for classification and detection with 53.87% test accuracy and 45.41 mAP. Most importantly, WEDGE can be used to fine-tune state-of-the-art detectors, improving SOTA performance on real-world weather benchmarks (such as DAWN) by 4.48 AP for well-generated classes like trucks. WEDGE has been collected under OpenAI\u2019s terms 1 of use and is released for public use under the CC BY-NC-SA 4.0 license.

      "abstract": "Autonomous truck-trailer communication requires high bandwidth and low latency when sensors are added to trailer to increase the capabilities of the self-driving software in the truck such as reverse driving. Legacy communications use powerline carrier communications at 9600 baud, so upfitting existing trailers for autonomous operations will require adopting technologies like Ethernet or a wireless harness between the truck and the trailer. This would require additional security measures and architecture, especially when pairing a tractor with a trailer. Security measures will vary depending on the type of communication which complicates the implementation and integration process. In this paper, we discuss the current challenges and threats on an autonomous truck-trailer communication when Ethernet or a wireless harness is used, the impact on the Electronic Control Unit (ECU) lifecycle. In addition to using Named Data Networking (NDN) to secure in-vehicle and cloud communication. Using a wireless medium will have a significant impact on the ECU lifecycle which requires additional development and lifecycle consideration, in addition to a secure architecture. Named Data Networking can reduce the complexity of the security of the in-vehicle communication networks where it provides a networking solution with security by design. NDN is still under development and has a strong potential for standardization for automotive applications to provide networking and security solutions simultaneously.",

      "abstract": "To solve the problem of active collision avoidance for unmanned surface vehicles (USVs) in a complex maritime environment, a method of deep reinforcement learning (DRL) based on proximal policy optimization (PPO) is proposed. To master the collision avoidance policy by self-learning, the mathematical model of USV, dynamic obstacle generation model, and reward mechanism were established. Using the relative position between the obstacle and USV and the information of the closest point of approach (CPA), high-dimensional state features including the collision track layer and collision threat layer were constructed. On this basis, combined with low-dimensional states such as navigation state and path error, a deep convolutional neural network (CNN) structure fused in multifeature and multiscale was designed. The proposed DRL network was trained through repeated collision avoidance simulations in random environments. Simulation results reveal that the proposed algorithm can output effective decisions in complex scenarios and avoid dynamic obstacles quickly and safely.",

      "abstract": "The increasing demand for safe and efficient maritime transportation has underscored the necessity of developing effective path-planning algorithms for Unmanned Surface Vehicles (USVs). However, the inherent complexities of the ocean environment and the non-holonomic properties of the physical system have posed significant challenges to designing feasible paths for USVs. To address these issues, a novel path planning framework is elaborately designed, which consists of an optimization model, a meta-heuristic solver, and a Clothoid-based path connector. First, by encapsulating the intricate nature of the ocean environment and ship dynamics, a multi-objective path planning problem is designed, providing a comprehensive and in-depth portrayal of the underlying mechanism. By integrating the principles of the candidate set random testing initialization and adaptive probability set, an enhanced genetic algorithm is devised to fully exploit the underlying optimization problem in constrained space, contributing to the global searching ability. Accounting for the non-holonomic constraints, the fast-discrete Clothoid curve is capable of maintaining and improving the continuity of the path curve, thereby promoting strong coordination between the planning and control modules. A thorough series of simulations and comparisons conducted in diverse ocean scenarios has conclusively demonstrated the effectiveness and superiority of the proposed path planning framework.",

Four biggest shipping companies suffered break-down in their operations after they were struck by malware. International Maritime Organization also was struck by cyber-attack which took its website down. Maritime community noticed rise in cyber-attacks on virtually all computer-based systems on board of vessels. For manned vessels risks to safety of navigation are mitigated by presence of crew on board but remain financial and reputational losses. Introduction of remotely controlled and fully autonomous unmanned vessels will increase seriousness of threats. Cyber-attack may severely hamper ship\u2019s operability or even lead to complete loss of control.

Autonomous ships, based on the collected information, recognize the environment without any human intervention and operate themselves using their own judgment. However, ship-to-land connectivity increased, owing to the real-time monitoring and remote control (for unexpected circumstances) from land; this poses a potential cyberthreat to various data collected inside and outside the ships and to the applied AI technology. For the safety of autonomous ships, cybersecurity around AI technology needs to be considered, in addition to the cybersecurity of the ship systems. By identifying various vulnerabilities and via research cases of the ship systems and AI technologies, this study presents possible cyberattack scenarios on the AI technologies applied to autonomous ships. Based on these attack scenarios, cyberthreats and cybersecurity requirements are formulated for autonomous ships by employing the security quality requirements engineering (SQUARE) methodology.",

However, as a double-edged sword, this new technology brings forth new threats. The purpose of this study is to raise awareness among stakeholders regarding the potential security threats posed by AI in MASSs. To achieve this, we propose a hypothetical attack scenario in which a clean-label poisoning attack was executed on an object detection model, which resulted in boats being misclassified as ferries, thus preventing the detection of pirates approaching a boat. We used the poison frog algorithm to generate poisoning instances, and trained a YOLOv5 model with both clean and poisoned data. Despite the high accuracy of the model, it misclassified boats as ferries owing to the poisoning of the target instance. Although the experiment was conducted under limited conditions, we confirmed vulnerabilities in the object detection algorithm. This misclassification could lead to inaccurate AI decision making and accidents. The hypothetical scenario proposed in this study emphasizes the vulnerability of object detection models to clean-label poisoning attacks, and the need for mitigation strategies against security threats posed by AI in the maritime industry.",

This study focuses on security threats faced by a deep neural network-based object classification algorithm, particularly you only look once version 5 (YOLOv5), which is a model used for object classification. We performed transfer learning on YOLOv5 and tested various adversarial attack methods. We conducted experiments using four types of adversarial attack methods and parameter changes to determine the attacks that could be detrimental to YOLOv5.

      "abstract": "In various domains such as energy, manufacturing, and maritime, cyber\u2013physical systems (CPSs) have seen increased interest. Both academia and industry have focused on the cybersecurity aspects of such systems. The assessment of cyber risks in a CPS is a popular research area with many existing approaches that aim to suggest relevant methods and practices. However, few works have addressed the extensive and objective evaluation of the proposed approaches. In this paper, a standard-aligned evaluation methodology is presented and empirically conducted to evaluate a newly proposed cyber risk assessment approach for CPSs. The approach, which is called FMECA-ATT&CK is based on failure mode, effects and criticality analysis (FMECA) risk assessment process and enriched with the semantics and encoded knowledge in the Adversarial Tactics, Techniques, and Common Knowledge framework (ATT&CK). Several experts were involved in conducting two risk assessment processes, FMECA-ATT&CK and Bow-Tie, against two use cases in different application domains, particularly an autonomous passenger ship (APS) as a maritime-use case and a digital substation as an energy-use case. This allows for the evaluation of the approach based on a group of characteristics, namely, applicability, feasibility, accuracy, comprehensiveness, adaptability, scalability, and usability. The results highlight the positive utility of FMECA-ATT&CK in model-based, design-level, and component-level cyber risk assessment of CPSs with several identified directions for improvements. Moreover, the standard-aligned evaluation method and the evaluation characteristics have been demonstrated as enablers for the thorough evaluation of cyber risk assessment methods.",

      "abstract": "Researchers and the oil industry are working to prevent oil spills from happening in the sea, rivers, on the ground, and other places. There are many pieces of art that involve casting oil out of water, and many sophisticated tools are utilized to do this. By using a skimmer as a gathering tool, this project offers a ship gadget that works at the water's surface to assist in cleaning up marine oil spills. The goal of this boat system is to surround the oil spill in a beneficial manner for quick and simple cleaning and prevent it from spreading further. The goal of this project is to minimize marine and coastal oil leaks. The boat is controlled and operated by a computer, and the cleaning of an oil spill is monitored via a wireless virtual camera. The gadget is visible since there is increasing oil being thrown into the water in a far-off direction. Oil spills pose a serious threat to maritime environments. The existence of the marine life bureaucracy is impacted It becomes very threatening. The use of the smart cellular allows for remote operation of the boat from any location. Additionally, this study employs a separation tool, which has been made for the tube with which the oil may be transported. 90% of oil can be separated by using this process. Skimming, In situ burning and Chemical dispersant are the methods available to remove oil from the ocean. These methods required manual involvement, but in our system there is no need for human interface. The whole process is automated. The system can be controlled and monitored using Bluetooth module.",

      "abstract": "The maritime industry has integrated a lot of automation in electronics since past few decades and will be investing more in upcoming years. This development has reduced a lot of manual work but has also introduced a lot of security vulnerabilities. As marine ships categorize as critical infrastructure, proper security measures must be taken to reduce the attack surface. This study focuses on a possible attack strategy using ethernet based network (IEC 61162\u2013450) which could result into potential capsize of the ship. This study refers Furuno's device manuals for forming an overview of the internal network of the ship. The attack script utilizes User Datagram Protocol to send malicious data packets into the network; specifically, injects fake Global Positioning System coordinates to implement Global Positioning System spoofing attack on Electronic Chart Display and Information System. Post that, a mitigation strategy in form of a PowerShell script is proposed. The script implements features of threat hunting as it identifies and terminates malicious programs injecting data packets into the internal network. This study proposes to implement automated threat detection and response-based program to be implemented on all Information Technology systems to reduce the impact of a possible intrusion by an external threat actor.",

      "abstract": "Voyage Data Recorders (VDRs), often referred to as the \u2018black boxes\u2019 of the shipping industry, collect and store vital data from key sensors and locations around the ship. This data plays a pivotal role in incident investigation, as was seen in the grounding of the Costa Concordia in 2012, and the sinking of the El Faro in 2015. With such an important role to play, the International Maritime Organization (IMO) has mandated that all SOLAS registered ships carry a VDR, which can demonstrate compliance with internationally agreed standards. Without a VDR compliant with these standards a ship cannot sail. However, the rise in the number, and sophistication, of digital devices are making the sector increasingly vulnerable to cyber-attacks. This paper will demonstrate a number of high-risk VDR cyber security vulnerabilities and review the current international technical standards covering all VDR devices being manufactured and used today, drawing attention to the minimum security requirements. The paper will go on to discuss how these standards fail to promote the necessary levels of cyber security needed to protect VDRs from today\u2019s cyber risks, amidst increased demands for digital connectivity for remote and autonomous operations. The paper will conclude by proposing several amendments (technical and non-technical) to the current standards which, if adopted, will help increase the minimum level of security of VDRs. Industry opinions were gathered on this topic, and their beliefs have been included across this paper.",

      "abstract": "Recent innovations in the smart city domain have led to the proposition of a new mode of transportation utilizing Autonomous Passenger Ships (APS) or ferries in inland waterways. The novelty of the APS concept influenced the cyber risk paradigm and led to different considerations regarding attack objectives, techniques as well as risk management approaches. The main factor that has led to this is the autoremote operational mode, which refers to autonomous operations and remote supervision and control in case of emergency. The autoremote operational mode influences the risk of cyber attacks due to the increased connectivity and reliance on technology for automating navigational functions. On the other hand, the presence of passengers without crew members imposes a safety risk factor in cyber attacks. In this paper, we propose a new cyber risk management approach for managing the cyber risks against cyber physical systems in general and Autonomous Passenger Ships in particular. Our proposed approach aims to improve the Defense-in-Depth risk management strategy with additional components from the Threat-Informed Defense strategy allowing for more evolved cyber risk management capabilities. Moreover, we have utilized the proposed cyber risk management approach for the proposition of a cybersecurity architecture for managing the cyber risks against an APS use case named milliAmpere2. Additionally, we present our results after conducting a Systematic Literature Review (SLR) in cybersecurity evaluation in the maritime domain. Then, the findings of the SLR were utilized for a suitable evaluation of the proposed risk management approach. Our findings suggest that our proposed risk management approach named Threat-Informed Defense-in-Depth is capable of enriching several risk management activities across different stages in the system development life cycle. Additionally, a comprehensive evaluation of the cybersecurity posture of milliAmpere2 has been conducted using several approaches including risk evaluation, simulation, checklist, and adversary emulation. Our evaluation has uncovered several limitations in the current cybersecurity posture and proposed actions for improvement.",

This issue might be tackled by exploiting modern techniques for automatic audio signal analysis, which have recently achieved impressive performance thanks to the advances in deep learning research. In this paper we show that convolutional neural networks can indeed significantly outperform traditional automatic methods in a challenging detection task: identification of dolphin whistles from underwater audio recordings. The proposed system can detect signals even in the presence of ambient noise, at the same time consistently reducing the likelihood of producing false positives and false negatives. Our results further support the adoption of artificial intelligence technology to improve the automatic monitoring of marine ecosystems.</p>",

      "abstract": "The marine environment surrounding islands and reefs exhibit significant time-varying characteristics, which require the path planning algorithm of an unmanned surface vehicle (USV) to have good environmental adaptability. To this end, a dynamic path planning algorithm for USV under an island\u2013reef environment is proposed. The algorithm fully considers these environmental features, such as ocean currents, tides, and winds, to construct an environment model. The environment model is combined with the USV motion model to construct a path planning model under the constraint of environmental disturbance time windows. This approach ensures that the path planning model can adapt to the time-varying marine environment. At the same time, to improve the safety of USV navigation by effectively predicting and timely avoiding passing ships, the velocity obstacle method is introduced for establishing a collision risk assessment model that detects the threat level of passing ships in the vicinity of the USV. Based on the decision-making basis generated by the model, a path replanning model is constructed under the constraint of collision detection time windows. This improves the dynamic collision avoidance capability of the path replanning model. Furthermore, to speed up the solution speed and accuracy of the path planning model and the path replanning model, the multiobjective particle swarm optimization algorithm is improved in three aspects: particle coding method, particle update strategy, and external archive maintenance mechanism. Simulation results show that the algorithm can enable USV to safely avoid multiple close-range dynamic obstacles under maritime rules, while also demonstrating a high level of adaptability to the time-varying marine environment.",

      "abstract": "As an outlook of the terrestrial network, the flexible Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV)-aided satellite-terrestrial integration network would have numerous prospective applications such as service enhancement, maritime communication, military, and emergency communication, which is getting significant attention. However, the public and open-access network must result in various imperative risks including impersonation, sensitive data, and privacy disclosure. Due to several unique characteristics including long transmission distance, unstable communication environment, resource-limited and highly dynamic characteristics of UAVs, diversified terminals that lack the ability of accessing the satellite and may be resource-limited, there are new challenges for the access authentication process in the UAV-Aided Satellite-Terrestrial Integration Networks with 5G. In this paper, we present a novel Physically Unclonable Function (PUF)-based access authentication scheme consisting of two access authentication protocols for the UAV and the ground terminals like 5G User Equipments (UEs), respectively. Two access authentication protocols for the drone and the terminals can both achieve mutual authentication, key agreement, and privacy protection with distinct advantages of no need to store secret key and supporting physical attack resistance. Finally, we propose an efficient handover authentication protocol executed by the ground terminals when the UAV is required to switch. We employ different security analysis tools to analyze the security of all proposed protocols, as well as present informal security analysis on various security properties. The performance comparison and evaluations show our protocols have better advantages.",

      "abstract": "Long-range underwater acoustic communication (LR-UWAC) is an essential technique for applications such as the control of unmanned underwater vehicles, gliders, or tactical submarines for long-term monitoring tasks. While techniques for estimating the channel impulse response (CIR) of short-range UWAC have been successfully applied, this is not the case for LR-UWAC. Here, the main challenge is to handle the diverse channel structure, which can be of a sparse or a non-sparse structure. In this paper, we propose a robust channel estimator for LR-UWAC. Our solution includes a switching mechanism to classify the channel as either sparse or non-sparse. In its sparse form, the LR-UWAC channel is characterized by a long time delay spread, time-invariant characteristics, and a block structure. Thus, we propose a non-trivial combination of the block subspace pursuit and the distributed subspace pursuit algorithms to exploit the channel\u2019s block structure. For non-sparse LR-UWAC channel structures, we approximate the received signal as Gaussian, and derive a maximum-likelihood (ML) estimator to separate the non-resolvable multipath. Extensive numerical simulation and results from two long-range sea experiments demonstrate the efficiency of our approach in identifying the channel\u2019s structure, and to accurately estimate the channel compared to state-of-the-art benchmarks.",

It is important to track and reconstruct vessel trajectories using the Automated Identification System (AIS) data in real-world applications for maritime navigation safety.

      "abstract": " All the shipping industry and also ship building (shipyards) are under a complex process of digital transformation (DT), and so are the maritime ports as part of this logistic chain of significant importance. This paper aims to review the successive information technology (IT)-based generations that impacted the maritime transport and logistics (computer-based optimization of transport routes; use of intelligent sensors and IoT; position monitoring by using geospatial technologies and databases; intelligence-based decisions), to identify their main features, and to propose an autonomous vessel-port management system that can be implemented in the future. The role of the geographic information system (GIS) is emphasized \u2013 as GIS-based electronic route optimization that allows ships to follow new paths and deliver goods in the most economical and efficient way; GIS-based location precision with the use of on board and ashore GIS-based sensors (electro-optics, remote sensing, LiDAR). The shipping digitalisation process is heading towards a totally autonomous and at the same time safe and reliable ship. Complete autonomy could be reached by adjoining artificial-intelligence controlled systems designed to navigate and operate the ship and that are equipped with sensing and analysis tools, situational awareness, planning, and control capabilities. The Vessel Traffic System (VTS) of the future needs innovative technologies and methodologies to be developed. The desired systems will automatically collect and process data with high precision, will provide input to decision-making systems, and suggest evasive maneuver; to deal with hazards and systems failure without human intervention onboard. The use of new technologies comes with new types of risks specific to maritime transportation and seaports (spoofing, data manipulation, cyber-attacks etc.) The implications of the findings are important for all stakeholders involved in maritime transport and associated logistics (seaports).

      "abstract": "<p>Wireless networks in agricultural environments are unique in many ways. Recent measurements reveal that the dynamics of crop growth impact wireless propagation channels with a long-term seasonal pattern. Additionally, short-term environmental factors, such as strong wind, result in variations in channel statistics. Next-generation agricultural fields, populated by autonomous tractors, drones, and high-throughput sensing systems, require high-throughput connectivity infrastructure, resulting in the future deployment of high-frequency networks, where they have not been deployed before. More specifically, when millimeter-wave (mmWave) communication systems, a viable candidate for 5G and 6G high-throughput solutions, are deployed for higher throughput, these issues become more prominent due to the relatively small wavelength at this frequency band. To improve coverage in the mmWave spectrum in agricultural settings, reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (RISs) are a promising solution with low energy consumption and high cost efficiency when compared to half-duplex active relays with multiple antennas. To ensure link resiliency under dynamic channel behavior, an adaptive RIS for broadband wireless agricultural networks (AgRIS) at mmWave band is designed in this work. AgRIS relies on output from a time-series model that forecasts the short-term wind speed based on measured wind data, which is readily available in most farms. The temporal correlation between link reliability and wind speed is demonstrated through extensive field experiments. Our simulation results demonstrate that AgRIS with a small footprint of 11 \u00d7 11 elements can help mitigate the adversarial effects of wind-induced signal level drop by up to 8\u00a0dB and provides high energy efficiency of 1\u00a0Gbits/joule.</p>",

      "abstract": "The use of Artificial Intelligence in the military is like two sides of a coin. It can provide convenience and aid in military operations but has the potential to hinder military operations. Dangerous and potentially catastrophic for humanity will be inevitable as no restrictions on its use. The United States, China, Australia, Japan, and India are examples of nations whose militaries have developed artificial intelligence technology. Geographically, Southeast Asia, which is located in the middle of these nations, will experience a significant impact due to its tight maritime borders if there is no international consensus on the military application of artificial intelligence technology. An autonomous or autonomous system to operate this technology will reduce the amount of human control and allow it to operate without any human intervention. It will be a threat to the application of the fundamental principles of international humanitarian law, such as the distinction principle, and proportionality principle. Where these principles are tightly intertwined with human command and control in making decisions regarding the execution of attacks. The article employs normative legal methodology. Furthermore, this paper endeavours to assess the pertinence of principles in international humanitarian law during the era of the artificial intelligence arms race. It also delves into the contribution of ASEAN in upholding stability, peace, and security in the Southeast Asia region, thereby reinforcing the importance of this research. This research emphasises the importance of aligning the progress of artificial intelligence in military contexts with core principles of international humanitarian law. It underscores the need for ASEAN to safeguard regional peace and security by establishing a novel regulatory framework that outlines restrictions on the development and deployment of artificial intelligence for military objectives.Keywords:&nbsp;Artificial Intelligence, International Law, Peace and Security, Southeast Asia.",

      "abstract": "The maritime industry is facing an escalating concern of cybersecurity threats, which can be attributed to the rapid growth of digital technologies and the recent adoption of autonomous and semi-autonomous shipping. To address this issue, various published papers have proposed cyberattack scenarios aiming to increase cybersecurity awareness and enhance the security of maritime systems. This research aims to assess the cybersecurity threats in the maritime sector by presenting three practical cyberattack scenarios and their corresponding risks and mitigation strategies. The first scenario involves the risks associated with utilizing the systems of a tug-boat as part of an attack vector, the second scenario examines the systems involved in vessel harbour manoeuvres using a laser docking system or Radar, and the third scenario examines an insider attack through malicious or unauthorized access to the Berthing Aid System (BAS).",

      "abstract": "The recent burgeoning of Internet of Things (IoT) technologies in the maritime industry is successfully digitalizing Maritime Transportation Systems (MTS). In IoT-enabled MTS, the smart maritime objects, infrastructure associated with ship or port communicate wirelessly using an open channel Internet. The intercommunication and incorporation of heterogeneous technologies in IoT-enabled MTS brings opportunities not only for the industries that embrace it, but also for cyber-criminals. Cyber Threat Intelligence (CTI) is an effective security strategy that uses artificial intelligence models to understand cyber-attacks and can protect data of IoT-enabled MTS proficiently. Unsurprisingly, most of the existing CTI-based solutions uses manual analysis to extract relevant threat information, and has low detection and high false alarm rate. Therefore, to tackle aforementioned challenges, an automated framework called DLTIF is developed for modeling cyber threat intelligence and identifying threat types. The proposed DLTIF is based on three schemes: a deep feature extractor (DFE), CTI-driven detection (CTIDD) and CTI-attack type identification (CTIATI). The DFE scheme automatically extracts the hidden patterns of IoT-enabled MTS network and its output is used by CTIDD scheme for threat detection. The CTIATI scheme is designed to identify the exact threat types and to assist security analysts in giving early warning and adopt defensive strategies. The proposed framework has obtained upto 99% accuracy, and outperforms some traditional and recent state-of-the-art approaches.",

      "abstract": "5G enabled maritime unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) communication is one of the important applications of 5G wireless network which requires minimum latency and higher reliability to support mission-critical applications. Therefore, lossless reliable communication with a high data rate is the key requirement in modern wireless communication systems. These all factors highly depend upon channel conditions. In this work, a channel model is proposed for air-to-surface link exploiting millimeter wave (mmWave) for 5G enabled maritime unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) communication. Firstly, we will present the formulated channel estimation method which directly aims to adopt channel state information (CSI) of mmWave from the channel model inculcated by UAV operating within the Long Short Term Memory (LSTM)-Distributed Conditional generative adversarial network (DCGAN) i.e. (LSTM-DCGAN) for each beamforming direction. Secondly, to enhance the applications for the proposed trained channel model for the spatial domain, we have designed an LSTM-DCGAN based UAV network, where each one will learn mmWave CSI for all the distributions. Lastly, we have categorized the most favorable LSTM-DCGAN training method and emanated certain conditions for our UAV network to increase the channel model learning rate. Simulation results have shown that the proposed LSTM-DCGAN based network is vigorous to the error generated through local training. A detailed comparison has been done with the other available state-of-the-art CGAN network architectures i.e. stand-alone CGAN (without CSI sharing), Simple CGAN (with CSI sharing), multi-discriminator CGAN, federated learning CGAN and DCGAN. Simulation results have shown that the proposed LSTM-DCGAN structure demonstrates higher accuracy during the learning process and attained more data rate for downlink transmission as compared to the previous state of artworks.",

Specifically, we develop a unique wireless communication model, a detailed wind turbine blade detection model, and a route planning scheme for the drone and boat to formulate the minimum energy consumption problem for drone inspection. Then, we demonstrate that this problem is a combinatorial optimization mixed-integer nonlinear programming problem, which we solve by decomposing the optimization problem into four subproblems. Moreover, an improved heuristic algorithm is constructed to solve the optimum energy consumption problem, exploiting these subproblems. The simulation results indicate that the proposed scheme achieves optimal energy consumption for boat-assisted drone inspection. Furthermore, compared with the existing methods, the proposed algorithm obtains the lowest total energy consumption and provides a higher route planning performance for the unmanned aerial vehicle and boat when utilized for offshore wind farm inspection.",

      "abstract": "Autonomy, cooperation and data fusion can increase the performance of robotic networks in many underwater applications. In this paper, we describe a novel occupancy grid (OG) based perception layer, and its use for controlling a network of autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs), sensorised with passive sonars. Data fusion between the robots' bearing-only measurements (typical of passive sonars) enables the estimate of target position. The developed OG framework exploits networking and the spatial diversity provided by the multi-robot system. The perception layer was integrated in the intelligent Cooperative Autonomous Decision Making Engine (iCADME) control architecture and validated for the first time in the Robotics Experimentation and Prototyping MUS (REPMUS) Exercise, held in Portugal in September 2021. Our robotic network participated in a technical demonstration, whose main objective was to localise a bottomed submarine which emitted a periodic help request acoustically during a simulated distress situation. We report results which are one of the first examples to demonstrate how cooperative robotics, supported by data fusion, can be effective in a passive sonar scenario. They also confirm the viability of adopting such solutions in real-world applications, characterised by poor communications and challenging environments. What was achieved at REPMUS21 clearly demonstrates how a network of cooperative robots can improve search & rescue operations of a submarine.",

      "abstract": "In this article, a small target classification method is proposed, which can effectively distinguish different types of sea surface targets under different sea states and different radars. The proposed classification method is mainly based on normalized time-frequency spectrograms and Residual Network (ResNet). The time-frequency images of the radar returns reflect the motion characteristics of the target, the fluctuation of the target Radar Cross Section (RCS) and the relationship between the target and the wave. The effect of different radar parameters on target classification can be eliminated by standardizing range resolution and carrier frequency of radar returns. By exploiting ResNet, the proposed method can effectively extract the deeply hidden features of normalized time-frequency images and solve the problems of gradient disappearance, gradient explosion and degradation in deep network. Datasets consisting of four types of targets, floating ball, floating boat, yacht and low altitude Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) are constructed to test the performance of the proposed method. The experiment results show that the proposed classifier combines normalized time-frequency images and ResNet attains better classification performance compared with the existing classification methods.",

In this article, we consider the UAV-assisted M-IoT network where USVs offload computation-intensive maritime tasks via non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) to the UAV equipped with the mobile-edge computing (MEC) server subject to the UAV mobility. To improve the energy efficiency of offloading transmission and workload computation, we focus on minimizing the total energy consumption by jointly optimizing the USVs\u2019 offloaded workload, transmit power, computation resource allocation, as well as the UAV trajectory subject to the USVs\u2019 latency requirements. Despite the nature of mixed discrete and non-convex programming of the formulated problem, we exploit the vertical decomposition and propose a two-layered algorithm for solving it efficiently. Specifically, the top-layered algorithm is proposed to solve the problem of optimizing the UAV trajectory based on the idea of deep reinforcement learning (DRL), and the underlying algorithm is proposed to optimize the underlying multidomain resource allocation problem based on the idea of the Lagrangian multiplier method. Numerical results are provided to validate the effectiveness of our proposed algorithms as well as the performance advantage of NOMA-enabled computation offloading in terms of overall energy consumption.",

Road vehicles will be characterized by a new intelligent vehicle technology such as Intelligent Autonomous vehicle (IAV) compared to the trucks, which are able to bring containers within the Terminal Container (TC) based on GPS. In the TC, electric unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) present in the TC are able to emulate redundant positioning data from the IAV, where its signals are disturbed within the corridor of containers. Petri nets are formal models suitable for modeling and controlling classes of systems such as transportation systems. They allow to control the movement of the IAV while reconstructing the positioning data of the IAV. This is ensured by GPS or by communication between the IAV that loses its position and the IAV s close to it, the other drones, and the crane. Thus, this paper proposes a reconfiguration strategy for the IAV to manage its navigation under resilient conditions, even if it loses its own GPS signal. Simulation results and perspectives are presented in this paper.",

      "abstract": "Preserving maritime ecosystems is a major concern for governments and administrations. Additionally, improving fishing industry processes, as well as that of fish markets, to have a more precise evaluation of the captures, will lead to a better control on the fish stocks. Many automated fish species classification and size estimation proposals have appeared in recent years, however, they require data to train and evaluate their performance. Furthermore, this data needs to be organized and labelled. This paper presents a dataset of images of fish trays from a local wholesale fish market. It includes pixel-wise (mask) labelled specimens, along with species information, and different size measurements. A total of 1,291 labelled images were collected, including 7,339 specimens of 59 different species (in 60 different class labels). This dataset can be of interest to evaluate the performance of novel fish instance segmentation and/or size estimation methods, which are key for systems aimed at the automated control of stocks exploitation, and therefore have a beneficial impact on fish populations in the long run.",

      "abstract": "An accurate and robust Automatic License Plate Recognition (ALPR) method proves surprising versatility in an Intelligent Transportation and Surveillance (ITS) system. However, most of the existing approaches often use prior knowledge or fixed pre-and-post processing rules and are thus limited by poor generalization in complex real-life conditions. In this paper, we leverage a YOLO-based end-to-end generic ALPR pipeline for vehicle detection (VD), license plate (LP) detection and recognition without exploiting prior knowledge or additional steps in inference. We assess the whole ALPR pipeline, starting from vehicle detection to the LP recognition stage, including a vehicle classifier for emergency vehicles and heavy trucks. We used YOLO v2 in the initial stage of the pipeline and remaining stages are based on the state-of-the-art YOLO v4 detector with various data augmentation and generation techniques to obtain LP recognition accuracy on par with current proposed methods. To evaluate our approach, we used five public datasets from different regions, and we achieved an average recognition accuracy of 90.3% while maintaining an acceptable frames per second (FPS) on a low-end GPU.",

      "abstract": "Autonomous and unmanned shipping are currently trending research topics within the maritime sector, with the promise of a reduction in operating costs and an increase in safety. Although they bring higher investment costs, due to the long lifetime of ships, autonomous ships are expected to bring savings during ship exploitation. This paper aims to analyze capital and operating costs of five different sizes and route length container ships (conventional ships), and under a set of assumptions analyze the same costs for equivalent autonomous ships. A ship cost model is formed, where the typical cost scheme (investment and exploitation costs) is extended by the potential carbon pricing. Carbon pricing is taken into account due to the fact that the design procedure for autonomous and unmanned ships requires the employment of a next-generation regulatory framework. All results indicate the significant economic benefit of autonomous ships over conventional ones. Sensitivity analysis reveals that fuel and emission costs have a great influence on the overall profitability of autonomous vehicles. Although the literature review indicates that reduced operating costs due to crew removal will bring savings for autonomous shipping, results show that savings due reduced operating costs is minor.",

      "abstract": "<p>In recent years, with the deep exploitation of marine resources and the development of maritime transportation, ship collision accidents occur frequently, which leads to the increasingly heavy task of maritime Search and Rescue (SAR). Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) have the advantages of flexible maneuvering, robust adaptability and extensive monitoring, which have become an essential means and tool for emergency rescue of maritime accidents. However, the current UAVs-based drowning people detection technology has insufficient detection ability and low precision for small targets in high-altitude images. Moreover, limited by the load capacity, UAVs do not have enough computing power and storage space, resulting in the existing object detection algorithms based on deep learning cannot be directly deployed on UAVs. To solve the two issues mentioned above, this paper proposes a lightweight deep learning detection model based on YOLOv5s, which is used in the SAR task of drowning people of UAVs at sea. First, an extended small object detection layer is added to improve the detection effect of small objects, including the extraction of shallow features, a new feature fusion layer and one more prediction head. Then, the Ghost module and the C3Ghost module are used to replace the Conv module and the C3 module in YOLOv5s, which enable lightweight network improvements that make the model more suitable for deployment on UAVs. The experimental results indicate that the improved model can effectively identify the rescue targets in the marine casualty. Specifically, compared with the original YOLOv5s, the improved model mAP@0.5 value increased by 2.3% and the mAP@0.5:0.95 value increased by 1.1%. Meanwhile, the improved model meets the needs of the lightweight model. Specifically, compared with the original YOLOv5s, the parameters decreased by 44.9%, the model weight size compressed by 39.4%, and Floating Point Operations (FLOPs) reduced by 22.8%.</p>",

      "abstract": "The agriculture and food sector will increasingly play a major role in the well-being of humanity. World-scale events, such as wars, climate changes, desertification, pandemic, etc., revealed how fragile humanity is from the point of view of food supply. Therefore, precision farming can provide a remarkable positive contribution to the primary sector globally at various levels. Nowadays, the employment of platforms for product data capture related to farming production and management is extensively available in several fields through local devices. Those systems comprehend sensors, automatic guidance systems with Global Navigation Satellite Systems (GNSSs), and central processing systems. Specifically, GNSS technology plays a central role in the autonomous guidance of tractors and farming robots. Until some years ago, high accuracy was a prerogative of expensive geodetic receivers whereas today high accuracy can be achieved also with low-cost receivers thanks to several factors, among all: the increased availability of GNSS interoperable constellations as well as the accessibility to several augmentation techniques both satellite- and ground-based. These factors are triggering the diffusion of autonomous machinery for farming purposes. This research aims to investigate the performance of a commercial Precise Point Positioning-Real Time Kinematic (PPP-RTK) correction service, employing a low-cost receiver. Two tests have been carried out with two different-grade antennas (a geodetic and a low-cost one). The tests showed that the employment of cost-effective equipment along with the exploitation of correction services allows reaching subdecimetre-level precision in less than one minute when employing a geodetic antenna; accuracy slightly degrades to decimetre-level with the low-cost antenna but the integer ambiguity is resolved in less time. Mean time-to-fix attests to 57 s for test 1 (geodetic antenna) and 30 s for test 2 (low-cost antenna). The times to obtain the first float ambiguity solution are equal to about 15 s for both tests. Integer ambiguity fixed solutions reveal a DRMS of 0.09 m and 0.012 m for test 1 and test 2, respectively. Float solutions reach a DRMS of 0.45 m and 0.63 m for test 1 and test 2, respectively. Lastly, when corrections are not available at all, single point positioning solutions reveal a DRMS of 1.36 m for test 1 and 3.15 m for test 2.",

      "abstract": "Due to the high reliance of daily activities on the Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS), its security is one of the major concerns for research and industry. Most navigation and mobile-driven location-based services use GNSS to render services. Due to the low power and easy access of GNSS signals, these signals are vulnerable to spoofing and other types of attacks. Recently many GNSS spoofing attacks have been identified in road- and maritime-based environments. This study provides a technique to detect and counter the GNSS spoofing attack in the maritime environment. This technique uses the Receiver Autonomous Integrity Monitoring (RAIM) model with Least Square Estimation (LSE) and Proportional Integral Derivative (PID) Control to detect the spoofing attack. The proposed technique is based on the concept of a genetic algorithm and navigation devices, such as inertial sensors and pilot options for the ship. A case study using the AIS dataset and simulation using MATLAB and NS3 is provided to validate the performance of the proposed approach. Nine different voyages from the AIS dataset were considered to check the accuracy and performance of the proposed algorithm. The accuracy of the proposed technique was analyzed using the correctly identified attack. The result shows that the proposed technique identifies spoofing attacks with an average value of 90 percent. For result analysis the considered nine routes were traversed multiple times. Root mean square error is used to calculate the positional mismatch (error rate). Based on the combined results analysis, the average value of RMSE is 0.28. In a best-case scenario, the proposed approach provides an RMSE value of 0.009.",

Mechanical structure and electronic design of this autonomous eboat are carried out. The catamaran type is chosen as the base of this e-boat. The mechanical design is done using SolidWorks and the manufacturing is done using 3D printing. A flight controller is used to control and maneuver the e-boat. The e-boat is steered using a differential thruster actuated using two motors mounted at each of the two hulls of the catamaran. ArduPilot, an open-source autopilot software usually used for the automated guided vehicles to achieve autonomy, is exploited to implement the PID control algorithm being designed and to monitor the boat status from a ground station. Tests have been conducted to evaluate the design, functionalities and performance of the e-boat. The results are discussed in this paper and some recommendations are presented.",

      "abstract": "Long-term and reliable marine ecosystems monitoring is essential to address current environmental issues, including climate change and biodiversity threats. The existing oceans monitoring systems show clear data gaps, particularly when considering characteristics such as depth coverage or measured variables in deep and open seas. Over the last decades, the number of fixed and mobile platforms for in situ ocean data acquisition has increased significantly, covering all oceans\u2019 regions. However, these are largely dependent on satellite communications for data transmission, as well as on research cruises or opportunistic ship surveys, generally presenting a lag between data acquisition and availability. In this context, the creation of a widely distributed network of SMART cables (Science Monitoring And Reliable Telecommunications) - sensors attached to submarine telecommunication cables - appears as a promising solution to fill in the current ocean data gaps and ensure unprecedented oceans health continuous monitoring. The K2D (Knowledge and Data from the Deep to Space) project proposes the development of a persistent oceans monitoring network based on the use of telecommunications cables and Autonomous Underwater Vehicles (AUVs). The approach proposed includes several modules for navigation, communication and energy management, that enable the cost-effective gathering of extensive oceans data. These include physical, chemical, and biological variables, both registered with bottom fixed stations and AUVs operating in the water column. The data that can be gathered have multiple potential applications, including oceans health continuous monitoring and the enhancement of existing ocean models. The latter, in combination with geoinformatics and Artificial Intelligence, can create a continuum from the deep sea to near space, by integrating underwater remote sensing and satellite information to describe Earth systems in a holistic manner.",

      "abstract": "Coastal marine environments are some of the most bio-rich ecosystems on earth, providing food and livelihoods for many coastal community members. However, the threats of anthropogenic and climate stressors on coastal environments highlight the need for robust monitoring to inform current and future environmental stewardship decisions. While traditional oceanographic sampling is typically done from a research vessel, this is often costly and logistically difficult for scientists and coastal communities alike. Ocean Networks Canada (ONC) in partnership with communities along Canada\u2019s western, eastern, and Arctic coasts have continued to advance a number of solutions for long-term marine monitoring [1]. Ocean Sonics has enabled these programs as a collaborator, technology provider, and information resource [2]. Selecting which solutions to use and how to integrate them in to existing programs requires careful attention. This technical paper aims to outline many of the possible solutions and the considerations that go in to selecting ones that maximize benefits to the communities Ocean Sonics designs and manufactures the \u201cicListen\u201d, the world\u2019s first smart digital hydrophone [3]. These hydrophones are deployed across ONC\u2019s network of cabled underwater observatories for long-term ocean acoustic monitoring; they are also deployed as autonomous underwater moorings and used to collect data from boats and surface buoys. Each of the above data collection methods have their advantages and disadvantages when serving the needs of coastal communities. ONC currently supports year-round, real-time data collection from hydrophones deployed on eight different cabled \u201cCommunity Observatory\u201d sites across the country in addition to hydrophones located on ONC\u2019s larger VENUS and NEPTUNE observatories. Through use of a cabled observatory, the Tsleil-Waututh Nation [4] is working with ONC and others to collect acoustic data in Burrard Inlet, right next to Canada\u2019s largest port. Meanwhile, the Malahat First Nation (also located on Canada\u2019s southern west coast) is an example of a community that is working with ONC and Ocean Sonics to incorporate a number of ocean acoustic monitoring methodologies in to their existing marine monitoring programs [5]. Malahat Nation aims to use boat-based and other data collection methods as a possible long-term acoustic monitoring strategy in their marine territory, with the immediate focus of identifying optimal locations for seafloor cabled observatories that can monitor whale and vessel interactions. Other communities along Canada\u2019s three coasts are equally keen to generate and advance integrated monitoring programs that include the collection and analysis of underwater acoustic data.Here we discuss a number of underwater acoustic monitoring methods currently being considered, used, and adapted by coastal communities and how they may play a part in achieving their specific research goals, answering key questions, and informing future plans and even changes to government policy. It is crucial that the communities understand how these methods can be effectively integrated in to their other environmental monitoring efforts and that they consider their overall capacity to support acoustic data collection. Capacity, in this case, needs to include aspects such as technical and scientific expertise, available funding, people-time for data collection and administration, availability of support vessels and other equipment, and even the overall desire and willingness to partner with others. The relative presence and absence of any of these aspects will ultimately work to define which methods are feasible and to what extent service providers, such as ONC and Ocean Sonics, may to be involved. For example, both ONC and Ocean Sonics offer standardized training to help build technical and scientific expertise but depending on the overall capacity of a given community relative to the complexity of the data required to answer their questions, they will likely need additional support from ocean acousticians to analyze and interpret the data and may need more fundamental support in defining initial research questions. ONC\u2019s broad vision includes providing knowledge and leadership that deliver solutions to society in general; community-based approaches to collecting underwater acoustic data are one of the means to support this vision. ONC\u2019s Community-Based Monitoring and Science Services teams use subsea cabled \u201cCommunity Observatories\u201d, boat based data collection methods, autonomous moorings, vessel traffic data, and standardized training as just some of the wide spectrum of complementary tools available to them when working directly with leadership and monitoring teams in coastal communities. ONC and the communities they work with rely heavily on manufacturers and subject matter experts such as Ocean Sonics to provide technical solutions and expertise. The communities themselves are the driving force behind these monitoring efforts, providing not just the people time and resources but also the context and purpose for which the data is being collected. This paper will explore how communities, academia, NGO\u2019s, and manufacturers can work together to build meaningful and well integrated marine monitoring programs that include ocean acoustic data",

      "abstract": "In this paper we describe an integrated system for maritime situational awareness (MSA) applications, built on a cooperative autonomous robotic network, and developed in the maritime use case of the INFORE EU H2020 project. INFORE project developed an interactive, real-time, extreme-scale analytics and forecasting system for handling and analysing massive streams of data. The MSA INFORE system exploits the synergy between global view (AIS data, ESA Sentinel satellite data), which provide contextual information over a wide area, and local view produced by a sensorised hybrid robotic network. Such a network was validated during the INFORE22 sea trial, held off the coast of Portovenere, Italy, in the Gulf of La Spezia, in February-March 2022. It was composed of a thermal camera and of two autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs) equipped with passive sonars. The robots fused their measurements, and cooperatively adapted their navigation for localising a suspicious vessel, communicating her position to the MSA INFORE platform in real-time. For controlling the robots, we developed a perception layer, based on an occupancy grid map framework, which enabled the fusion of passive sonar bearing-only measurements for target localisation. The perception layer was also the basis for making cooperative decisions to adapt the network spatial configuration for improving mission performance. In this paper we report and discuss results from the INFORE22 trial. These results are one the first demonstrations of how data fusion and cooperative autonomy can increase the performance of a complex robotic network in a passive sonar surveillance mission in a real-world scenario. The INFORE MSA systems paves the way towards the development of complex, integrated MSA systems, which exploit robotic networks, characterised by advanced cooperative autonomy capabilities, for improving the local view picture, and for promptly reacting to the evolving scenario.",

Aiming at the problem of lack of broad and integrated digital twin implementations with live data along with the absence of a digital twin-driven framework for AMSV design and development, an application framework for the development of a fully autonomous vessel using an integrated digital twin in a 3D simulation environment has been presented. Our framework has 4 layers which ensure that simulation and real-world vessel and the environment are as close as possible. \u00c5boat, an in-house, experimental research platform for maritime automation and autonomous surface vessel applications, equipped with two trolling electric motors, cameras, LiDARs, IMU and GPS has been used as the case study to provide a proof of concept. \u00c5boat, its sensors, and the environment have been replicated in a commercial, 3D simulation environment, AILiveSim. Using the proposed application framework, we develop obstacle detection and path planning systems based on machine learning which leverage live data from a 3D simulation environment to mirror the complex dynamics of the real world. Exploiting the proposed application framework, the rewards across training episodes of a Deep Reinforcement Learning model are evaluated for live simulated data in AILiveSim.",

      "abstract": "In this paper, an unmanned aerial vehicle is utilized as an aerial relay to connect onshore base station with offshore users in a maritime IoT system with uplink non-orthogonal multiple access enabled. A coordinated direct and relay transmission scheme is adopted in the proposed system, where close shore maritime users directly communicate with onshore BS and offshore maritime users need assistance of an aerial relay to communicate with onshore BS. We aim to minimize the total transmit energy of the aerial relay by jointly optimizing the UAV hovering position and transmit power allocation. The minimum rate requirements of maritime users and transmitters\u2019 power budgets are considered. The formulated optimization problem is non-convex due to its non-convex constraints. Therefore, we introduce successive convex optimization and block coordinate descent to decompose the original problem into two subproblems, which are alternately solved to optimize the UAV energy consumption with satisfying the proposed constraints. Numerical results indicate that the proposed algorithm outperformed the benchmark algorithm, and shed light on the potential of exploiting the energy-limited aerial relay in IoT systems.",

      "abstract": "With the continuous increase in human\u2013robot integration, battlefield formation is experiencing a revolutionary change. Unmanned aerial vehicles, unmanned surface vessels, combat robots, and other new intelligent weapons and equipment will play an essential role on future battlefields by performing various tasks, including situational reconnaissance, monitoring, attack, and communication relay. Real-time monitoring of maritime scenes is the basis of battle-situation and threat estimation in naval battlegrounds. However, images of maritime scenes are usually accompanied by haze, clouds, and other disturbances, which blur the images and diminish the validity of their contents. This will have a severe adverse impact on many downstream tasks. A novel large kernel encoder\u2013decoder network with multihead pyramids (LKEDN-MHP) is proposed to address some maritime image dehazing-related issues. The LKEDN-MHP adopts a multihead pyramid approach to form a hybrid representation space comprising reflection, shading, and semanteme. Unlike standard convolutional neural networks (CNNs), the LKEDN-MHP uses many kernels with a 7 \u00d7 7 or larger scale to extract features. To reduce the computational burden, depthwise (DW) convolution combined with re-parameterization is adopted to form a hybrid model stacked by a large number of different receptive fields, further enhancing the hybrid receptive fields. To restore the natural hazy maritime scenes as much as possible, we apply digital twin technology to build a simulation system in virtual space. The final experimental results based on the evaluation metrics of the peak signal-to-noise ratio, structural similarity index measure, Jaccard index, and Dice coefficient show that our LKEDN-MHP significantly enhances dehazing and real-time performance compared with those of state-of-the-art approaches based on vision transformers (ViTs) and generative adversarial networks (GANs).",

      "abstract": "The modern industrial system relies heavily on maritime transport to secure the elements required for the production process. Therefore, surface vessel navigation is becoming increasingly complex especially in narrow and busy waterways. Autonomous surface vessels are becoming an attractive solution to govern safe maritime operations in such waterways. Due to the many possible ways of encountering a ship, it is impossible to employ a rule-based navigation developed at design time. Instead, the manoeuvre decision for safe collision avoidance must be shifted to operation time with added requirement of being able to adapt with new scenarios that are not exploited at training time. In such highly dynamic interwoven systems the demand of mastering the ever-changing system integration becomes essential. In this article, I describe for the challenges that appear with the goal of training autonomous surface vessels for the purpose of public transport, and I summarise the proposed approaches to realise a collision-free navigation system for such surface vessels.",

      "abstract": "To support Indigenous communities in preparing for uncertainties such as climate change impacts and unexpected threats to health, there are calls by researchers and community members for decision support tools that meaningfully and sensitively bring together Indigenous contextualized factors such as social dynamics, local- and culture-specific knowledge, and data with academic tools and practices including predictive modeling. This project used a community engaged approach to co-create an agent-based model geographically bounded to a reserve community to examine three community-requested simulations. Community members and researchers co-designed, built, and verified the model simulations: a contaminated water delivery truck; a Pow Wow where a waterborne infectious disease spreads; and a flood which restricts typical movement around the reserve for daily tasks and health care. The simulations\u2019 findings, displayed as both conventional and narrative outputs, revealed management areas where community adaptation and mitigation are needed, including enhancing health service provision in times of disease outbreaks or large community events, and creating back-up plans for overcoming flood impacts to ensure services are accessible for vulnerable members of the community. Recommendations for communities, researchers, and modelers are discussed.",

      "abstract": "The rapid propagation of Eichhornia crassipes has a threatening impact on the aquatic environment. For most small water areas with good ecology, daily manual monitoring and salvage require considerable financial and material resources. Unmanned boats have important practical significance for the automatic monitoring and cleaning Eichhornia crassipes. To ensure that the target can be accurately detected, we solve the problems that exist in the lightweight model algorithm, such as low accuracy and poor detection effect on targets with small or unclear characteristics. Taking YOLOV5m 6.0 version as the baseline model, given the computational limit of real-time detection, this paper proposes to use EfficientNet-Lite0 as the backbone, use the ELU function as the activation function, modify the pooling mode in SPPF, embed the SA attention mechanism, and add the RFB module in the feature fusion network to improve the feature extraction ability of the whole model. The dataset collected water hyacinth images from ponds and lakes in Guangxi, Yunnan, and the China Plant Image Library. The test results show that efficient YOLOV5 reached 87.6% mAP, which was 7.1% higher than that of YOLOV5s, and the average detection time was 62 FPS. The ablation experiment verifies the effectiveness of each module of efficient YOLOV5, and its detection accuracy and model parameters meet the real-time detection requirements of the Eichhornia crassipes unmanned cleaning boat.",

This has resulted in a rise in maritime activities and challenges in the security of communication between entities involved in a ship\u2019s port navigation. In response to the challenges, the suggested security strategy in this work can provide vital security features such as authentication between communicating entities and important security services while consuming fewer resources. This technique also calculates the ideal distance between the berthing ship and the available parking site using their geographic coordinates to provide optimal navigation for a berthing ship. An external entity known as the trusted third party is in charge of calculating the optimum path, which works as a middleman in the communication process. The suggested technique is resistant to a variety of security attacks, these are Man-in-the-Middle attack, Replay attack, information leakage, and impersonation attack. This scheme also assures unlinkability and anonymity. The Automated Validation of Internet Security Protocols and Applications (AVISPA) software is utilized to formally verify the proposed scheme\u2019s safety.",

The optical hindrances create a non linear distortion that affects the performance of tasks involving object detection, object tracking, classification and object segmentation.Underwater exploration is carried out by Autonomous Underwater Vehicles (AUV) and Underwater robots. Several tasks that require visually perceptive imagery for performing marine trash identification, monitoring the species and their migration, inspection of the health of coral reefs, tracking the cables of submarines and ship wreckage, seabed mapping. This can also be used for enhancing underwater images of user pictures. Marine life is under an increasing threat from human activities which can be monitored using the proposed idea.The paper successfully implements automatic color enhancement, dehazing, and contrast adjustment using deep learning techniques that perform image-to-image translations. The setup uses Unsupervised learning approach on unpaired dataset and Cycle Consistent Generative Adversarial Network. The paper provides comparison of the Unsupervised learning approach with the Classical Image processing approach that uses color correction adaptatively and the application of dehazing theory.",

      "abstract": "There has been an increasing interest in incorporating Artificial Intelligence (AI) into Defence and military systems to complement and augment human intelligence and capabilities. However, much work still needs to be done toward achieving an effective human-machine partnership. This work is aimed at enhancing human-machine communications by developing a capability for automatically translating human natural language into a machine-understandable language (e.g., SQL queries). Techniques toward achieving this goal typically involve building a semantic parser trained on a very large amount of high-quality manually-annotated data. However, in many real-world Defense scenarios, it is not feasible to obtain such a large amount of training data. To the best of our knowledge, there are few works trying to explore the possibility of training a semantic parser with limited manually-paraphrased data, in other words, zero-shot. In this paper, we investigate how to exploit paraphrasing methods for the automated generation of large-scale training datasets (in the form of paraphrased utterances and their corresponding logical forms in SQL format) and present our experimental results using real-world data in the maritime domain.",

      "abstract": "Connectivity-enabled automation of distributed control systems allow for better anticipation of system disturbances and better prediction of the effects of actuator limitations on individual agents when incorporating a model. Automated convoy of heavy-duty trucks in the form of platooning is one such application designed to maintain close gaps between trucks to exploit drafting benefits and improve fuel economy, and has traditionally been handled with classically-designed connected and adaptive cruise control (CACC). This paper is motivated by demonstrated limitations of such a control strategy, in which a classical CACC was unable to efficiently handle real-world road grade and velocity transient disturbances without the assistance of fleet operator intervention, and is non-adaptive to varied hardware and loading conditions of the operating truck. This automation strategy is addressed by forming a cooperative model predictive control (MPC) for eco-platooning that considers interactions with trailing trucks to incentivize platoon harmonization under road disturbances, velocity transients, and engine limitations, and further improves energy economy by reducing unnecessary engine effort. This is accomplished for each truck by sharing load, maximum engine power, transmission ratios, control states, and intended trajectories with its nearest neighbors. The performance of the considerate and cooperative strategy was demonstrated on a real-world driving scenario against a similar non-considerate control strategy, and overall it was found that the considerate strategy significantly improved harmonization between the platooned trucks in a real-time implementable manner.",

Maritime, among the sectors, started to exploit the potential of drone technology for the automation of critical functions and processes, contributing to human safety, digitization, port advancement, and economic growth. The use of drones in maritime, albeit in infancy, provides the poten-tial for developing an ecosystem of maritime drone services to enable the wide-scale adoption of drones by ports and maritime service providers supported by maritime regulatory and standardization bodies. This paper presents an ecosystem perspective of maritime drone services by identifying the key stakeholders and their potential roles, which play a central part in the formation and subsequent functioning of the ecosystem to unlock the true potential of drone technology for maritime at a broader scale. The paper also presents a literature review of the existing and potential applications of drones in various subdomains of maritime, such as ports, terminals, port limits, and at sea. Finally, the paper identifies several challenges and potentials which demand further investigations for developing the ecosystem of maritime drone services.",

      "abstract": "Autonomous or semi-autonomous driving constitutes an important business case to the trucking industry. To realize its full potential it is mandatory to enable autonomous or semi-autonomous driving especially in challenging traffic situations such as roundabouts and sharp bends. As a step towards this goal, the main objective of this paper is to investigate the optimal trajectory planning of heavy-duty long-haul trucks for real-world applications with coupled longitudinal and lateral dynamics of the truck-trailer system. We present a detailed dynamical model and propose objectives that optimize with respect to safety, and to find a suitable compromise between efficiency and driving performances. Using these ingredients, we generate trajectories for maneuvering an articulated vehicle, subject to realistic constraints on narrow roads. We use Bock\u2019s Direct Multiple Shooting method in combination with structure-exploiting iterative optimization methods, efficiently implemented in the software package MUSCOD-II, to generate fast, reliable, and feasible solutions for the complex and highly nonlinear problem. We analyze the solutions with differently weighted objectives for a realistic scenario, maintaining safety, and building compromises between energy efficiency, driving quality, and speed maintenance that reflects time efficiency.",

      "abstract": "In order to enhance the anti-submarine capability of multi-unmanned aerial vehicles (multi-UAVs) in the unknown sea environment and improve the search efficiency, in this paper, we propose a rule-inspired-multi-ant colony (RI-MAC)-based UAV cooperative search algorithm. First, a special sea area anti-submarine search model is established, including an association rule-driven target probability map (TPM) model, a UAV kinematics model, and a sensor model. The novel model has the characteristics of rule linkage, which effectively improves the accuracy of target detection probability in unknown environments. Secondly, according to the established search model, a multi-objective utility function based on association rules is derived. In order to solve the problem of multi-objective optimization, an RI-MAC algorithm based on association rules is proposed, and a pheromone update method using threat avoidance is designed to optimize the search path of multi-UAVs. Finally, a simulation experiment is conducted to verify the effectiveness and superiority of the proposed search algorithm.",

      "abstract": "Phytosanitary treatment is one of the most critical operations in vineyard management. Ideally, the spraying system should treat only the canopy, avoiding drift, leakage and wasting of product where leaves are not present: variable rate distribution can be a successful approach, allowing the minimization of losses and improving economic as well as environmental performances. The target of this paper is to realize a smart control system to spray phytosanitary treatment just on the leaves, optimizing the overall costs/benefits ratio. Four different optical-based systems for leaf recognition are analyzed, and their performances are compared using a synthetic vineyard model. In the paper, we consider the usage of three well-established methods (infrared barriers, LIDAR 2-D and stereoscopic cameras), and we compare them with an innovative low-cost real-time solution based on a suitable computer vision algorithm that uses a simple monocular camera as input. The proposed algorithm, analyzing the sequence of input frames and exploiting the parallax property, estimates the depth map and eventually reconstructs the profile of the vineyard\u2019s row to be treated. Finally, the performances obtained by the new method are evaluated and compared with those of the other methods on a well-controlled artificial environment resembling an actual vineyard setup while traveling at standard tractor forward speed.",

      "abstract": "Efforts to develop high-energy laser (HEL) weapons that are capable of being integrated and operated aboard naval platforms have gained an increased interest, partially due to the proliferation of various kinds of unmanned systems that pose a critical asymmetric threat to them, both operationally and financially. HEL weapons allow for an unconstrained depth of magazine and cost exchange ratio, both of which are essential characteristics to effectively oppose small unmanned systems, compared to their kinetic weapons counterparts. However, HEL performance is heavily affected by atmospheric conditions between the weapon and the target; therefore, the more precise and accurate the atmospheric characterization, the more accurate the performance estimation of the HEL weapon. To that end, the Directed Energy Group of the Naval Postgraduate School (NPS) is conducting experimental, theoretical and computational research on the effects of atmospheric conditions on HEL weapon efficacy. This paper proposes a new approach to the NPS laser performance code scheme, which leverages artificial neural networks (ANNs) for the prediction of optical turbulence strength. This improvement could allow for near real-time and location-independent HEL weapon performance estimation. Two experimental datasets, which were obtained from the NPS facilities, were utilized to perform regression modeling using an ANN, which achieved a decent fit (R2 = 0.75 for the first dataset and R2 = 0.78 for the second dataset).",

      "abstract": "Autonomous ships would require higher cyber-physical interaction in comparison with traditional shipping operations, thus increasing the vulnerabilities associated with cyber security. The increasing complexity surrounding the innate characteristics of the shipping industry makes it challenging to build a resilient framework for ensuring cyber security. This study proposes a multi-criteria decision-making (MCDM) framework for assessing cyber security risk in the autonomous shipping context. The research was validated through surveying subject matter experts, system designers and seafarers. Different types of equipment and systems are ranked based on their perceived vulnerability to cyber threats. Survey data from 28 subject matter experts are collected and analysed through the Bayesian best\u2013worst method (BWM). At system level, the results indicate that navigational systems are the most vulnerable to potential cyber threats, while propulsion systems are the least vulnerable element in the context of future autonomous shipping operations. On a sub-system level, the three most vulnerable parts are Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS), Electronic Chart Display and Information System (ECDIS) and the communication devices on shore control centres (SCC), while the least vulnerable parts are engine controls, SCC integration platforms and cargo handling at ports.",

      "abstract": "Along with the rapid development of marine radar, and particularly those carried on aircraft, the detection of small-sized targets which pose an increasing threat has become one of the main areas of interest. However, by considering an observation chain from an aircraft (such as a drone) in a maritime environment, with the aim of detecting and tracking of low signal-to-clutter ratio (SCR) targets, one of the important points would be the analysis of the radar system performance according to the radar input parameters, the atmospheric propagation medium, the various sea clutter characterization, and the type of targets (RCS, speed, etc.) in this environment. Therefore, it is necessary to obtain the overall path loss including the anomalous atmospheric environment, gas attenuation, clouds attenuation, rainfall attenuation, and beam scanning loss. To consider atmospheric attenuations, ITU-R models are used. On another side, because of spikes and dynamic variation properties, sea clutter is generally described by the statistical distribution with long tail and by its wider Doppler spectrum. Conventional algorithms such as those based on statistical models, MTI, and MTD processing are often limited, especially for the target of low speed and low RCS. Therefore, sea clutter, including empirical and statistical models available, is considered to estimate and simulate the impact of radar input parameters, targets RCS, and sea state on detection performance. The Doppler frequency of target echo which can be exploited for coherent processing is described by assuming an adequate scenario of observation geometry.",

A fundamental requirement for the design and implementation of such a cyber-physical system is seamless, predictable, and secure interoperability between vendor-specific hardware and software subsystems. The article describes a system design that includes mechanisms to mitigate the risks and consequences of software defects, individual component malfunction, and harmful cyber interference. It addresses international regulations in the field and demonstrates a system design that can meet the requirements for safe behaviour in foreseeable events while also having the ability to call for human assistance if the autonomous system is unable to handle a situation. The paper presents a design for highly automated vessels with several inherent risk-reducing features, including the ability to isolate and encapsulate abnormal behaviours, built-in features to support resilience to unexpected events, and mechanisms for internal defence against cyber-attacks. The article shows how this is provided by a novel middleware that supports risk mitigation, dependability, and resilience.",

      "abstract": "It is challenging to optimize the human-machine control authority allocation for an autonomous marine vessel in general. It is crucial to establish an effective scheme which achieves an optimal coordination between the human operator/crew and the vessel countering any threats to crew or vessel, sensory faults and other hostile operating conditions. An intelligent scheme which in cooperates the potential threats via learning-based modelling which could forecast the restrictions on navigation and control based on redundant sources to execute different level of shared control authority (between a human operator either on-bard or on-shore station and the vessel) with respect to International Maritime Organization (IMO) classification on degrees of autonomy. The scheme systematically constructs a decision-based smooth control allocation based on the potential sensor vulnerabilities (spoofing, interference, GNSS segment errors, jamming, scintillation, solar activity etc.,) and the factors of human-error which causes collision as per the Convention on the International Regulations for Preventing Collisions at Sea (COLREGs). Hence, this paper presents a scheme that establishes a topology for shared control authority for marine vessels considering the fact that still standards and regulations regarding marine autonomy still lack clarity and evolving. Hence, this would facilitate integration of existing Collision Avoidance Systems with an intelligent operator which regulates the intervention of human-operator in the loop for increased autonomy, safety and optimal cooperation.",

      "abstract": "As an indispensable part of the Internet of Vehicles (IoV), unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) can be deployed for target positioning and navigation in the space\u2013air\u2013ground-integrated network (SAGIN) environment. Maritime target positioning is very important for the safe navigation of ships, hydrographic surveys, and marine resource exploration. Traditional methods typically exploit satellites to locate marine targets in the SAGIN environment, and the location accuracy does not satisfy the requirements of modern ocean observation missions. In order to localize the marine target, we develop a system architecture in this article, which contains UAVs integrated with monostatic multiple-input\u2013multiple-output (MIMO) radars. The main thrust is to estimate the direction-of-arrival (DOA) via MIMO radar. Herein, we consider a general scenario that unknown mutual coupling exist and a novel sparse reconstruction algorithm is proposed. The mutual coupling matrix (MCM) is adopted with the help of its special structure, we formulate the data model as a sparse representation form. Then, two novel matrices, a weighted matrix, and a reduced-dimensional matrix are constructed to reduce the computational complexity and enhance the sparsity, respectively. Thereafter, a sparse constraint model is constructed using the concept of optimal weighted subspace fitting (WSF). Finally, the DOA estimation of maritime targets can be achieved by reconstructing the support of a block sparse matrix. Based on the DOA estimation results, multiple UAVs are used to cross-locate marine targets multiple times, and an accurate marine target position is achieved in the SAGIN environment. Numerical results are carried out, which demonstrates the effectiveness of the proposed DOA estimator, and the multi-UAV cooperative localization system can realize accurate target localization.",

At the same time, while relying more and more on trained DL models, the reliability and robustness of VBS have been challenged and it has become crucial to test thoroughly these models to assess their capabilities and potential errors. To discover faults in DL models, existing software testing methods have been adapted and refined accordingly. In this article, we provide an overview of these software testing methods, namely differential, metamorphic, mutation, and combinatorial testing, as well as adversarial perturbation testing and review some challenges in their deployment for boosting perception systems used in VBS. We also provide a first experimental comparative study on a classical benchmark used in VBS and discuss its results.",

      "abstract": "Bathymetric surveys performed using small, unmanned vessels are increasingly used in coastal areas and regions difficult to access by hydrographic motorboats. Their geometric dimensions, manoeuvring parameters, low labour intensity, and costs of survey execution have allowed the unmanned survey vessel (USV) to be a commonly recognised surveying platform. It is equipped with a navigation system for positioning, maintaining a course or survey line, determining spatial orientation, and measuring depths. The operation zone of the global navigation satellite system (GNSS) in coastal water regions enables geodetic positioning in land-based surveys and of moving objects, also including, for example, a sounding vessel. Under difficult observational conditions, the positioning is limited by the obscuration of the upper hemisphere, i.e., the visibility of satellites and the reflection from high field buildings. This poses a threat to a small vessel operating at a very short distance from a hydro-engineering structure. Based on a study performed in a marina, the article presents the determination of the minimum safe distance of the planned survey line to the quay in terms of the USV\u2019s dimensions under good sounding conditions. These include low and constant velocity and good observational conditions for a GNSS receiver. The analysis was conducted on survey lines perpendicular to the quay, which was approached twice at distances of 1\u20135 m, with a 0.5 m interval. A 1 m distance between the end of the survey line and the quay has been determined for the safety of USV\u2019s navigation and continuity of geospatial data collection during bathymetric surveys.",

      "abstract": "Lidar, radar, and camera are the major candidate sensors used in autonomous boat navigation. Compared with lidar, millimeter-wave radar is more robust under severe weather conditions (e.g., rain, fog). However, the sparsity of radar point cloud results in a false alarm or a missed detection when only radar is used. To improve the accuracy and reliability of object detection under boat docking scenes, a new object detection method is proposed in this paper, which utilizes a newly proposed multi-frame point cloud alignment algorithm to generate a more dense and stable point cloud, and in further a novel clustering algorithm to exploit semantic information of vision to enrich radar points' feature. Moreover, oriented by the requirements of obstacle avoidance in wharf scenarios, a new detection performance metric called Non-Occupation Overlap (NOO) is specifically designed. To demonstrate the proposed method, the in field test is performed using a 77GHz radar and a camera during ship maneuvers in the wharf. Both qualitative analysis and quantitative experiments verify the superiority of the proposed detection method as compared to conventional ones.",

      "abstract": "Several disruptive attacks against companies in the maritime industry have led experts to consider the increased risk imposed by cyber threats as a major obstacle to undergoing digitization. The industry is heading toward increased automation and connectivity, leading to reduced human involvement in the different navigational functions and increased reliance on sensor data and software for more autonomous modes of operations. To meet the objectives of increased automation under the threat of cyber attacks, the different software modules that are expected to be involved in different navigational functions need to be prepared to detect such attacks utilizing suitable detection techniques. Therefore, we propose a systematic approach for analyzing the navigational NMEA messages carrying the data of the different sensors, their possible anomalies, malicious causes of such anomalies as well as the appropriate detection algorithms. The proposed approach is evaluated through two use cases, traditional Integrated Navigation System (INS) and Autonomous Passenger Ship (APS). The results reflect the utility of specification and frequency-based detection in detecting the identified anomalies with high confidence. Furthermore, the analysis is found to facilitate the communication of threats through indicating the possible impact of the identified anomalies against the navigational operations. Moreover, we have developed a testing environment that facilitates conducting the analysis. The environment includes a developed tool, NMEA-Manipulator that enables the invocation of the identified anomalies through a group of cyber attacks on sensor data. Our work paves the way for future work in the analysis of NMEA anomalies toward the development of an NMEA intrusion detection system.",

      "abstract": "Monitoring of aquatic ecosystems has been historically accomplished by intensive campaigns of direct measurements (by probes and other boat instruments) and indirect extensive methods such as aero-photogrammetry and satellite detection. These measurements characterized the research in the last century, with significant but limited improvements within those technological boundaries. The newest advances in the field of smart devices and increased networking capabilities provided by emerging tools, such as the Internet of Things (IoT), offer increasing opportunities to provide accurate and precise measurements over larger areas. These perspectives also correspond to an increasing need to promptly respond to frequent catastrophic impacts produced by drilling stations and intense transportation activities of dangerous materials over ocean routes. The shape of coastal ecosystems continuously varies due to increasing anthropic activities and climatic changes, aside from touristic activities, industrial impacts, and conservation practices. Smart buoy networks (SBNs), autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs), and multi-sensor microsystems (MSMs) such as smart cable water (SCW) are able to learn specific patterns of ecological conditions, along with electronic \u201cnoses\u201d, permitting them to set innovative low-cost monitoring stations reacting in real time to the signals of marine environments by autonomously adapting their monitoring programs and eventually sending alarm messages to prompt human intervention. These opportunities, according to multimodal scenarios, are dramatically changing both the coastal monitoring operations and the investigations over large oceanic areas by yielding huge amounts of information and partially computing them in order to provide intelligent responses. However, the major effects of these tools on the management of marine environments are still to be realized, and they are likely to become evident in the next decade. In this review, we examined from an ecological perspective the most striking innovations applied by various research groups around the world and analyzed their advantages and limits to depict scenarios of monitoring activities made possible for the next decade.",

      "abstract": "This paper presents a model for a multi-drone system used for detecting oil spills in seawater. The system is designed to provide an early warning for oil-derivative contamination that may threaten maritime life forms. The system hosts a lightweight machine vision algorithm for detecting oil spills and generating a path for the drones to follow. Also, the system incorporates robust communication; allowing the drones to collaborate as they track the generated path. To achieve autonomous tracking for drones, a robust control scheme is proposed. Specifically, the drone\u2019s dynamics model is decomposed into two subsystems in terms of time scale transformation; leading to inner and outer loop dynamics. A combination of nonlinear integral sliding surface and backstepping procedure is employed to produce appropriate thrust and torque forces, which guarantees robust tracking performances of the drones. The proposed system was verified both in simulation as well as in an indoor multi-drone verification environment. The results attest to the efficacy of the developed model.",

      "abstract": "Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), especially fixed-wing ones that withstand strong winds, have great potential for oceanic exploration and research. This paper studies a UAV-aided maritime data collection system with a fixed-wing UAV dispatched to collect data from marine buoys. We aim to minimize the UAV\u2019s energy consumption in completing the task by jointly optimizing the communication time scheduling among the buoys and the UAV\u2019s flight trajectory subject to wind effect. The conventional successive convex approximation (SCA) method can provide efficient sub-optimal solutions for collecting small/moderate data volume, whereas the solution heavily relies on trajectory initialization and has not explicitly considered wind effect, while the computational/trajectory complexity both become prohibitive for the task with large data volume. To this end, we propose a new cyclical trajectory design framework with tailored initialization algorithm that can handle arbitrary data volume efficiently, as well as a hybrid offline-online (HO2) design that leverages convex stochastic programming (CSP) offline based on wind statistics, and refines the solution by adapting online to real-time wind velocity. Numerical results show that our optimized trajectory can better adapt to various setups with different target data volume and buoys\u2019 topology as well as various wind speed/direction/variance compared with benchmark schemes. In particular, our proposed HO2 design can effectively adapt to random wind variations with feasible and robust online operation, and proactively exploit the wind for further energy savings in both single-buoy and multi-buoy scenarios.",

      "abstract": "Joint exploitation of multiple features is a recognized way to implement the effective detection of small targets on the sea in high-resolution maritime radars at the dwelling mode. The tri-feature-based and feature-compression-based detectors use the time-consuming convex hull learning and decision. In this article, a fast feature-fusion-based detector using seven salient features is proposed, where the convex hull learning and decision are replaced by simple threshold determination and decision. It is found that the seven features of sea clutter can be modeled well by the Burr type XII and t-distributions. From the fitted distribution, each feature is normalized to approximate the standard Gaussian distribution by a nonlinear transformation. In the seven-dimensional normalized feature space, an analytical method is given to calculate the optimal weights of feature fusion by the maximization of the interclass distance of the two-class samples. Owing to the normalization of the seven features, the feature fusion loss is significantly reduced comparing with the direct fusion of seven features. The fast feature-fusion-based detector was evaluated on the open and recognized radar databases and offshore experimental data using an unmanned aerial vehicle with a corner reflector. The results show that the fast detector attains competitive performance with the existing best feature-based detector.",

      "abstract": "<p>Freshwater harmful algal blooms (HABs), caused mostly by toxic cyanobacteria, produce a range of cyanotoxins that threaten the health of humans and domestic animals. Climate conditions and anthropogenic influences such as agricultural run-off can alter the onset and intensity of HABs. Little is known about the distribution and spread of freshwater HABs. Current sampling protocols in some lakes involve teams of researchers that collect samples by hand from a boat and/or from the shoreline. Water samples can be collected from the surface, from discrete-depth collections, and/or from depth-integrated intervals. These collections are often restricted to certain months of the year, and generally are only performed at a limited number of collection sites. In lakes with active HABs, surface samples are generally sufficient for HAB water quality assessments. We used a unique DrOne Water Sampling SystEm (DOWSE) to collect water samples from the surface of three different HABs in Ohio (Grand Lake St Marys, GLSM and Lake Erie) and Virginia (Lake Anna), United States in 2019. The DOWSE consisted of a 3D-printed sampling device tethered to a drone (uncrewed aerial system, or UAS), and was used to collect surface water samples at different distances (10\u2013100\u00a0m) from the shore or from an anchored boat. One hundred and eighty water samples (40 at GLSM, 20 at Lake Erie, and 120 at Lake Anna) were collected and analyzed from 18 drone flights. Our methods included testing for cyanotoxins, phycocyanin, and nutrients from surface water samples. Mean concentrations of microcystins (MCs) in drone water samples were 15.00, 1.92, and 0.02\u00a0ppb for GLSM, Lake Erie, and Lake Anna, respectively. Lake Anna had low levels of anatoxin in nearly all (111/120) of the drone water samples. Mean concentrations of phycocyanin in drone water samples were 687, 38, and 62\u00a0ppb for GLSM, Lake Erie, and Lake Anna, respectively. High levels of total phosphorus were observed in the drone water samples from GLSM (mean of 0.34\u00a0mg/L) and Lake Erie (mean of 0.12\u00a0mg/L). Lake Anna had the highest variability of total phosphorus with concentrations that ranged from 0.01\u00a0mg/L to 0.21\u00a0mg/L, with a mean of 0.06\u00a0mg/L. Nitrate levels varied greatly across sites, inverse with bloom biomass, ranging from below detection to 3.64\u00a0mg/L, with highest mean values in Lake Erie followed by GLSM and Lake Anna, respectively. Drones offer a rapid, targeted collection of water samples from virtually anywhere on a lake with an active HAB without the need for a boat which can disturb the surrounding water. Drones are, however, limited in their ability to operate during inclement weather such as rain and heavy winds. Collectively, our results highlight numerous opportunities for drone-based water sampling technologies to track, predict, and respond to HABs in the future.</p>",

      "abstract": "Summary Currently, active hostilities related to Russian aggression are taking place on the territory of Ukraine. The Zmeinyy Island, which has the great importance for the maritime economic zone of Ukraine, is no exception. The island is located 40 km east of the mouth of the river. Danube. In connection with its demilitarization and economic restoration, the problem of household and drinking water supply will become acute. Therefore, the search for drinking groundwater and the drilling of exploration and production boreholes will be a very important issue. Our report briefly reviews the results of complex geological and geophysical studies carried out by the Dnepropetrovsk geophysical expedition \u201cDneprogeofizika\u201d on the island in 2002. Detailed integrated geophysical surveys to study the geological and hydrogeological structure of the island Zmeinyy included: gravimetric observations on a network of 20 x 10 m, magnetometric - 10 x 5 m and electrometric (DUS-IP) - 40 x 5 m. According to the results of geological and geophysical studies, the presence of three water-bearing strata in the depth intervals was established: 38.0 \u2013 54.6 m; 57.6 \u2013 74.0 m; 80.8 \u2013 109.4 g. Drilled three wells No. 1; 2; 4 have a fresh water flow rate of up to 10 m3 per day each. For the physical and chemical control of the selected water samples, the wells were equipped with special autonomous sensors, which showed that the breach of the natural regime of the island\u2019s groundwater occurs during the constant exploitation of well No. 2. An analysis of the initial data of daily observations of the dynamic and physicochemical parameters of groundwater indicates that the anthropogenic factor makes a significant contribution to the formation of the hydrodynamic, temperature, and hydrochemical regimes of the island.",

      "abstract": "As technology evolves, the level of automation in the maritime industry grows, and will continue to grow significantly, as the industry strives for fully autonomous vessels. Current maritime operations on board rely on a mixture of automated processes, human decision making, and human interventions. In the future autonomy may lead to the removal of the mariner physically on board, increasing remotely operated vessels. The remote nature of these operations will subject mariners to new operational risks, such as a potential reduction in Situational Awareness (SA) and/or cyber threats. This article will discuss the importance of SA in maritime operations, and the potential challenges facing this when engaging in remote operations. Secondly, this article will discuss the training that mariners may need to navigate within such a remote operational landscape. Lastly, it is fundamental to understand how mariners currently manage higher risk operations (e.g. heavy traffic and port arrival/departure), and how this will change with the introduction of remote operations.\nMisas, JP; Hopcraft, R; Tam, K",

Due to the above, it becomes important to raise awareness and take measures to ensure adequate security; this is also important at the level of the virtual securing of ships. This article consists of an introduction to the topic. It presents the current trends and directions of development of maritime transportation and the risks related to them. It contains an overview of the current safety systems on ships and the present safety resolutions.

A systematic categorization of vessel components has been conducted, complemented by an analysis of key services delivered within ports. The vulnerabilities of the Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) have been given particular consideration since it is a critical subcategory of many maritime infrastructures and, consequently, a target for cyber attacks. Recent research confirms that the dramatic proliferation of cyber crimes is fueled by increased levels of integration of new enabling technologies, such as IoT and Big Data. The trend to greater systems integration is, however, compelling, yielding significant business value by facilitating the operation of autonomous vessels, greater exploitation of smart ports, a reduction in the level of manpower and a marked improvement in fuel consumption and efficiency of services. Finally, practical challenges and future research trends have been highlighted.",

      "abstract": "Serious games can be used as a means to explore complex systems and uncertainty related challenges, therefore they may have the potential of supporting the adoption of innovative and disruptive technologies. In this paper we present the use case of the Maritime Unmanned Systems Trust (MUST) Game, which goal is to capture beliefs, attitude and perspectives of the participants with respect to the employment of maritime unmanned systems (MUS) in the maritime domain. This novel game aims at better understanding the relation between trust factors and MUS. Moreover, it explores how players make decisions with respect to MUS deployments in an increasing threat scenario. This allows to capture important information on the trade-offs related to MUS use that have an impact on maritime missions planning activities (e.g., endurance, logistics, maintenance, cost, number of assets, security and type of assets). This paper describes the game and an analysis of the outcomes of its deployment. The results show how the MUST Game design has been effective in eliciting constructive discussion around the use of MUS in maritime missions, as well as in the collection of assessments and decisions, which are currently being used in algorithmic development.",

      "abstract": "Material transportation is an essential process in mining operations and accounts for a large portion of total energy consumption. With the development of automation technology, autonomous mining trucks have been deployed in open-pit mines to reduce transportation costs. Compared to manned mining trucks, autonomous trucks are more appropriate for automatic scheduling techniques due to their high informatization, high-precision perception, and sophisticated control. However, the existing truck scheduling research does not exploit autonomous trucks\u2019 strengths to perform more delicate control, but still takes a traditional approach toward autonomous trucks. In this paper, we propose a mixed-integer programming model for joint optimization of autonomous trucks trips and speeds to minimize energy consumption. To solve the proposed scheduling model, a novel tabu search algorithm is proposed, which consists of two parts: an improved flow allocation model with matching factor is formulated in the upper part to determine the optimal truck flow, and in the lower part a tabu search procedure guided with the optimal flow is developed. Based on the mathematical model and solution technique, we also propose a real-time scheduling system of autonomous trucks for the stochastic and dynamic mining environment. A coal mine in Inner Mongolia, China, for example, we verified the effectiveness of the proposed truck scheduling model and real-time scheduling approach. We demonstrate that the proposed allocation model effectively accelerates the tabu search procedure, and for short-term decisions, the proposed solution technique satisfies the computational requirements of the real-time scheduling system.",

      "abstract": "From delivering groceries and vital medical supplies to driving trucks and passenger vehicles, society is becoming increasingly reliant on autonomous vehicles (AVs), It is therefore vital that these systems be resilient to adversarial actions, perform mission-critical functions despite known and unknown vulnerabilities, and protect and repair themselves during or after operational failures and cyber-attacks. While techniques have been proposed to address individual aspects of software resilience, vulnerability assessment, automated repair, and invariant detection, there is no approach that provides end-to-end trusted and resilient mission operation and repair on AVs. In this paper, we describe our experience of building START,11Software Techniques for Automated Resilience and Trust a framework that provides increased resilience, accurate vul-nerability assessment, and trustworthy post-repair operation in autonomous vehicles. We combine techniques from binary analysis and rewriting, runtime monitoring and verification, auto-mated program repair, and invariant detection that cooperatively detect and eliminate a swath of software security vulnerabilities in cyberphysical systems. We evaluate our framework using an autonomous vehicle simulation platform, demonstrating its holistic applicability to AVs.",

      "abstract": "With the ever-increasing demand for the content delivery services in autonomous vehicular networks (AVNs), caching popular contents in the edge nodes in advance is expected to reduce the transmission delay. Current works on the contents cached in connected and autonomous vehicles (CAVs) or roadside units (RSUs) are facing the problems of limited caching size and high deployment cost. In this paper, by exploiting the advantages of high caching space and flexibility of truck platoons composed of connected and autonomous trucks (CATs), we propose a secure content delivery service for CATs based on coalition formation game. Firstly, in order to protect the security and privacy of content delivery services, a differential privacy model is proposed to protect the sensitive information of CATs. Meanwhile, the differential privacy model is combined with the incentive based trust evaluation model to monitor the behaviors of CATs. In the incentive based models, CATs are encouraged to improve their trust values to obtain higher utilities and find a balance between confidence levels and utilities. Moreover, a coalition formation game is established among CATs with the same driving route, in which all CATs can maximize their utilities with the formation of several minor coalitions. Finally, we conduct extensive simulations to demonstrate the effectiveness and superiority of the proposed scheme.",

      "abstract": "Trajectory planning is essential for self-driving vehicles and has stringent requirements for accuracy and efficiency. The existing trajectory planning methods have limitations in the feasibility of planned trajectories and computational efficiency. This paper proposes a life-long learning framework to achieve effective and high-accuracy direct trajectory planning (DTP) tasks. Based on generative adversarial networks (GANs), this study develops a lightweight GDTP model to map the initial/final states and the control action sequence. Additionally, by embedding the GDTP into the rapidly-exploring random tree (RRT), a GDTP-RRT algorithm is further designed for long-distance and multi-stage planning tasks. Taking the tractor-trailer as an application case, we test the proposed method in multiple scenarios with varying characteristics. The experimental results show that the method can plan highly feasible trajectories in a short time, compared with the most applied algorithm \u2013 the cubic curve RRT* (CCRRT*). It is found that the tracking errors of our method are 29.1% and 44.1% lower than the CCRRT* in terms of position and heading angle. This paper provides an effective and stable vehicle trajectory planning method for complex self-driving tasks.",

      "abstract": "The illegal exploitation of protected marine environments has consistently threatened the biodiversity and economic development of coastal regions. Extensive monitoring in these\u2013 often remote\u2013 areas is challenging. Machine learning methods are useful in object detection and classification tasks and have the potential to underpin techniques for the development of robust monitoring systems to overcome this problem. However, development is hindered due to the limited number of publicly available labelled and curated datasets. Furthermore, there are relatively few open-source state-of-the-art methods to be used for evaluation. This paper presents an investigation of automated classification methods using underwater acoustic signals to infer the presence and type of vessels navigating in coastal regions. Various combinations of deep convolutional neural network architectures, and preprocessing filter layers, were evaluated using a new dataset based on a subset of the extensive open-source Ocean Networks Canada hydrophone data. Tests were conducted in which VGGNet and ResNet networks were applied to classify the input data. The data was preprocessed using either Constant Q Transform (CQT), Gammatone, Mel spectrogram, or a combination of these filters. With over 97% accuracy, using all three preprocessing representations simultaneously yielded the most reliable result. However, high accuracies of 94.95% were achieved using CQT as the preprocessing filter for a ResNet-based convolutional neural network, providing a trade-off between model complexity and accuracy; a result that is more than 10% higher than previously reported approaches. This more accurate classifier for underwater acoustics could be used as a reliable autonomous monitoring system in maritime environments.",

      "abstract": "In maritime, coastal, and riverine environments debris has become an abundant pollutant, posing a significant threat to aquatic life. Existing debris detection systems are mostly designed to detect debris for specific type of environment. Therefore, we propose GADAN, an autonomous debris detection model fusing RGB and thermal images, and experiment on both over land and aquatic environment. We collected data using the Parrot Anafi Thermal drone from different water streams, and construction sites near the aquatic environment. We employ a generative domain adaptation based architecture to generate the thermal image compatible with the RGB image. We postulate a two-stream network on these thermal and RGB pairs of images separately, and pass the concatenated features to object detecting YOLO model. We also demonstrated the performance of debris detection using only RGB and only thermal images. Our proposed GADAN network incorporating RGB and thermal images outperforms (with a mean average precision of 0.97) RCNN and single modality based models.",

The formal, quantified modeling of the needed path changes is a vitally needed to provide safe management of the ship and to provide secure policy in collision avoidance. A second criterion coming from cost reduction of the ship exploitation and environment protection matter is related with fuel consumption in path planning. This research develops a formal model which targets simultaneously goals for safe avoidance of collision in a faster way and also to minimize the fuel consumption. These both targets are formalized by bi-level optimization. The research presents this bi-level model which is implemented in optimization problem.

      "abstract": "Path planning and path following are key technologies for autonomous vehicles. Strong nonlinearity, coupling characteristics, parametric uncertainties, external disturbances, and complicated driving scenarios put forward great challenges in estimation, control, and optimization of autonomous vehicles. Multi-dimension information utilization offers an effective solution to cope with the foregoing challenges. The presented research proposes a path planning and tracking framework for optimal design and regulation of control variables for collision avoidance and active guidance system, aiming to improve tracking performance and system robustness. For path planning approach, a virtual harmful potential field in 3 dimension (3D) is built to provide a collision-free trajectory as a reference path for path following, depending on vehicle kinematic model and boundary conditions of roads. A linear parameter-varying, polytopic vehicle lateral model is developed to address the issues of time-variable longitudinal speeds and preview distance on vehicle lateral stability management. Further, a strong robust gain-scheduling path following control approach based on linear matrix inequality methodology is proposed to tackle problems relating to characteristics of temporal variations, parametric uncertainties and external disturbances. Comparisons study under the TruckMaker/Xpack4-RapidECU joint HIL platform demonstrate that both tracking precision and high robustness to parametric uncertainties and external disturbances are superior than model predictive control method. The presented path following method provides an important insight into exploiting the robust control method's favorable merits while guaranteeing its computing efficiency.",

      "abstract": "In offshore maritime operations, automated systems capable of maintaining the vessel\u2019s position and heading using its own propellers and thrusters to compensate exogenous disturbances, like wind, waves, and currents, are referred to as marine dynamic positioning (DP) systems. DP systems play a central role in several marine operations, such as drilling, pipe-laying, coring, and ocean observation. These operations are the primary cause of fuel consumption, having a strong impact on the overall footprint of the vessel. For this reason, we will face the problem of optimal thrust allocation of an over-actuated vessel to maintain position and heading with minimal fuel consumption. State-of-the-art approaches simplify this problem by roughly approximating it and obtain a simple, mostly convex, optimization problem that can be solved in near-real time by the automation system. In this article, we improve current approaches with the following contributions. We will exploit a higher fidelity representation of the physical system, and we will manipulate the resulting optimization problem accordingly, to allow for near-real-time solutions on conventional computing platforms on-board. We evaluate the quality of the proposal with a case study on a drilling unit equipped with six thrusters. The results will show that it is possible to achieve up to 5% of fuel savings with respect to conventional approaches. Note to Practitioners\u2014This article was motivated by the problem of minimizing fuel consumption in thrust allocation of DP systems. The current approaches simplify this issue by adopting simpler, yet related, optimization problems as surrogates, keeping the problem tractable for near-real-time control. We propose, instead, to solve the original problem with state-of-the-art modelization of the physical system and exploit reasonable and theoretical proprietaries to achieve optimal solutions in near-real-time. The results on a drilling unit will show additional fuel savings of up to 5% with respect to alternative state-of-the-art approaches.",

      "abstract": "The integration of intelligent functionalities in con-nected and autonomous automotive system has great potential to deliver personalised user experience and improve traffic manage-ment. It can benefit the society by improving highway capacity and safety of road users. The adoption of data-driven Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning models in the automotive sector is opening venues to new services and business models such as autonomous fleet management, self-driving trucks, robo-taxi etc. However, where the sharing of mix-critical data brings opportunities, it simultaneously presents serious cybersecurity and functional safety risks. In recent years, the cyber attacks have impacted every segment of automotive system including electronic control unit, infotainment, communications, firmware, mobile apps etc. This adoption of AI and ML as enabling technology for next-generation autonomous transportation systems is going to significantly widen the automotive attack surface. This trend has increasing tendency of exposing both vehicle and road -side infrastructure to a wide range of sophisticated cyber attacks. This paper aims to review and build a body of knowledge on the topic of automotive cybersecurity, by bridging a domain-specific knowledge gap among automotive system designers, engineers and system security architects. For this purpose, it discuss the autonomous driving system data processing pipeline and threat analysis and risk assessment process of automotive cybersecurity standard ISO/SAE 21434 to harness and harden automotive cybersecurity. It highlights automotive system architectural and ecosystem challenges in adopting AI and ML driven decision making.",

It has been designed and developed by SSTL (Surrey Satellite Technology Limited, UK) in collaboration with Airbus and COMDEV. The SAR payload provides medium resolution SAR data ranging from 6m-45m. The AIS instrument operating in VHF is used to collect data simultaneously along with SAR imagery of the same area for ship detection. The data has immense potential for applications like flood monitoring agricultural crop assessment, forest monitoring, land use mapping, disaster management and maritime applications.National Remote Sensing Centre (NRSC) has been entrusted with the responsibility of Ground segment realization for scheduling, reception, processing and dissemination of NovaSAR data at the Integrated Multi-Mission Ground Segment for Earth Observation Satellites (IMGEOS), to Indian and SAARC users as per the ISRO Pricing policy. NRSC has developed, customized and established the framework of automated workflows for generation of Scene-Based Analysis Ready Data Products (ARD) for NovaSAR. This manuscript describes the NovaSAR process flow in IMGEOS from generation to dissemination of Scene-based ARD products for various SAR imaging modes with a theme-based analysis of the derived Radar backscatter at S-band. The AIS data exploitation with respect to ship detection is also presented. The paper also highlights the primary data quality parameters evaluated on the various imaging modes of NovaSAR.",

      "abstract": "Monocular 3D object detection is an important and challenging task in autonomous driving. Due to the ill-posed nature of 3D detection, recent studies use prior knowledge on object categories to estimate 3D parameters. However, for each object category in real driving scenes, there exist a couple of sub-categories with different shapes (i.e. length, width, and height). For example, vehicle generally contains the sub-categories of car, van, and truck. Obviously, single prior knowledge cannot cover such diverse sub-categories. In this paper, we propose MP-Mono that exploits multiple priors to improve object detection. Specifically, a data-heuristic strategy is presented to generate multiple 3D proposals, in which we leverage the unsupervised algorithm to cluster potential sub-categories from realistic datasets, and a height-guided inference policy is used to determine the initial distances of proposals, reducing the difficulty of network learning. Additionally, we propose a local-ground embedding method that learns local depth information to enhance monocular 3D detection. The experimental results on the KITTI dataset demonstrate that our MP-Mono achieves competitive performances compared to other monocular methods, verifying the effectiveness of multi-prior integration and local-ground embedding.",

      "abstract": "Globally, coral reefs are threatened by ocean warming and acidification. The degree to which acidification will impact reefs is dependent on the local hydrodynamics, benthic community composition, and biogeochemical processes, all of&nbsp;which vary on different temporal and spatial scales. Characterizing the natural spatiotemporal variability of seawater carbonate chemistry across different reefs is critical for elucidating future impacts on coral reefs. To date, most studies have focused on select habitats, whereas fewer studies have focused on reef scale variability. Here, we investigate the temporal and spatial seawater physicochemical variability across the entire Heron Island coral reef platform, Great Barrier Reef, Australia, for a limited duration of six days. Autonomous sensor measurements at three sites across the platform were complemented by reef-wide boat surveys and discrete sampling of seawater carbonate chemistry during the morning and evening. Variability in both temporal and spatial physicochemical properties were predominantly driven by solar irradiance (and its effect on biological activity) and the semidiurnal tidal cycles but were influenced by the local geomorphology resulting in isolation of the platform during low tide and rapid flooding during rising tides. As a result, seawater&nbsp;from previous tidal cycles was sometimes trapped in different parts of the reef leading to unexpected biogeochemical trends in space and time. This study illustrates the differences and limitations of data obtained from high-frequency measurements in a few locations compared to low-frequency measurements at high spatial resolution and coverage, showing the need for a combined approach to develop predictive capability of seawater physicochemical properties on coral reefs.",

      "abstract": "This paper describes a new multimodal maritime dataset recorded using a multispectral suite of sensors, including AIS, GPS, radar, and visible and thermal cameras. The visible and thermal cameras are mounted on the vessel itself and surveillance is performed around the vessel in order to protect it from piracy at sea. The dataset corresponds to a series of acted scenarios which simulate attacks to the vessel by small, fast-moving boats (\u2018skiffs\u2019). The scenarios are inspired by real piracy incidents at sea and present a range of technical challenges to the different stages in an automated surveillance system: object detection, object tracking, and event recognition (in this case, threats towards the vessel). The dataset can thus be employed for training and testing at several stages of a threat detection and classification system. We also present in this paper baseline results that can be used for benchmarking algorithms performing such tasks. This new dataset fills a lack of publicly available datasets for the development and testing of maritime surveillance applications.",

      "abstract": "Cooperative automated driving technology has emerged as a potential way to increase the efficiency of transportation systems and enhance traffic safety by allowing vehicles to exchange relevant information via wireless communication. Truck platooning utilizes this technology and achieves synchronized braking and acceleration, controlling two or more trucks simultaneously. This synchronized control makes driving with a very short inter-vehicle distance among trucks possible and reduces aerodynamic drag. This provides significant fuel consumption reduction, both in leading and trailing trucks, and achieves fuel-saving improvement. However, the static positioning sacrifices trucks in the front since they consume more fuel energy because of more air resistance than the rears. To solve this in-equivalent fuel consumption reduction benefit, this paper presents several heuristic algorithms to balance fuel consumption reduction and prolong the driving ranges by exploiting position changes among trucks in a platoon. Furthermore, the proposed algorithms try to reduce the number of position changes as much as possible to prevent any fuel waste caused by the unnecessary position change operations. In this manner, each truck in the platoon is likely to share a similar fuel consumption reduction with fewer position change counts, thus addressing the challenge of in-equivalent fuel savings distribution and obtaining optimal fuel efficiency. Our extensive simulation results show that the proposed algorithms can prolong the total distance by approximately 3% increased in two-truck platooning and even higher in six-trucks platooning of approximately 8%. Moreover, our proposed algorithms can decrease the position change count and ensure that trucks only switch to position arrangement once with no duplicate. Therefore, truck platooning obtains the maximum driving range with fewer position change counts, thus achieving efficient fuel saving.",

      "abstract": "Recent technological developments have paved the way to the employment of Autonomous Underwater Vehicles (AUVs) for monitoring and exploration activities of marine environments. Traditionally, in information gathering scenarios for monitoring purposes, AUVs follow predefined paths that are not efficient in terms of information content and energy consumption. Informative Path Planning (IPP) represents a valid alternative, defining the path that maximises the gathered information. This work proposes a Genetic Path Planner (GPP), which consists in an IPP strategy based on a Genetic Algorithm, with the aim of generating a path that simultaneously maximises the information gathered and the coverage of the inspected area. The proposed approach has been tested offline for monitoring and inspection applications of Posidonia Oceanica (PO) in three different geographical areas. The a priori knowledge about the presence of PO, in probabilistic terms, has been modelled utilising a Gaussian Process (GP), trained on real marine data. The GP estimate has then been exploited to retrieve an information content of each position in the areas of interest. A comparison with other two IPP approaches has been carried out to assess the performance of the proposed algorithm.",

      "abstract": "International maritime crime is becoming increasingly sophisticated, often associated with wider criminal networks. Detecting maritime threats by means of fusing data purely related to physical movement (i.e., those generated by physical sensors, or hard data) is not sufficient. This has led to research and development efforts aimed at combining hard data with other types of data (especially human-generated or soft data). Existing work often assumes that input soft data is available in a structured format, or is focused on extracting certain relevant entities or concepts to accompany or annotate hard data. Much less attention has been given to extracting the rich knowledge about the situations of interest implicitly embedded in the large amount of soft data existing in unstructured formats (such as intelligence reports and news articles). In order to exploit the potentially useful and rich information from such sources, it is necessary to extract not only the relevant entities and concepts, but also their semantic relations, together with the uncertainty associated with the extracted knowledge (i.e., in the form of probabilistic knowledge graphs). This will increase the accuracy of, and confidence in, the extracted knowledge and facilitate subsequent reasoning and learning. To this end, we propose Maritime DeepDive, an initial prototype for the automated construction of probabilistic knowledge graphs from natural language data for the maritime domain. In this paper, we report on the current implementation of Maritime DeepDive, together with preliminary results on extracting probabilistic events from maritime piracy incidents. This pipeline was evaluated on a manually crafted gold standard, yielding promising results.",

      "abstract": "Modern agriculture and farmers have been benefiting from the broad possibilities that wireless sensor networks and Internet of Things, in general, can bring to this primary sector and associated businesses. This new approach, also known as precision farming, exploits multiple high-end technologies, typically centered on environmental data sensing of diverse nature, e.g., temperature, humidity, moisture and COx, which can provide valuable indicators regarding the conditions where crops and livestock are produced. For that purpose, the respective sensors can be deployed in specific places in a farm, remaining static, or they can be placed on board of vehicles, such as tractors and unmanned aerial vehicles. Such sensors can also be integrated into wearable devices that are put on livestock individuals to track their positions, behavior and physiological aspects. Furthermore, this advanced technology-based approach to farming includes the respective data processing and analytics, in many cases employing machine learning and artificial intelligence techniques and algorithms, namely to provide the farmer with appropriate and reliable decision support systems. The work presented here focus specifically on a mobile application, which allows to collect inputs from users at the field and includes such human assessments in the automated loop of the sensing data flow in a precision farming system. The developed solution enables new functionalities on such systems, namely towards data auditing and labelling, that can be initiated directly from the field, which is where the sensors are and the respective sensing conditions can be assessed by the mobile app user.",

However, these requirements in turn lead to high cost of both spectrum and hardware in USVs. In order to alleviate this issue, an integrated localization and communication assisted multi-USV network is conceived in this paper. Specifically, an orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) based dual-functional radar-communication system is designed for enabling radar detection, channel estimation, as well as data detection at each USV. Then, closed-form equations and a demodulation-and-forward (DeF) strategy exploiting full spatial diversity gain are provided for the implementations of localization and data transmissions, respectively. Finally, the system performance is evaluated by simulations, showing that the proposed system is capable of attaining accurate localization and reliable communications in face of hostile marine environments.",

      "abstract": "In the next decades, the popularity of Internet of Vehicles (IoV) technologies and autonomous driving promises to fundamentally change the way of handling the traffic flow on the streets. Traffic separation can be entirely carried out from a remote traffic control center without the police. This work introduces a sequential coordination algorithm, namely SCA, to form and sort platoons of vehicles to quickly exit traffic bottleneck areas caused by temporary situations, such as vehicular accidents and a slow tractor. By exploiting maneuver information from IoV data sharing, SCA schedules the vehicles in a queue by their arrival and lane priority and then instructs them to safely drive through in order. The experimental results demonstrate our approach can reduce up to 32% waiting time for the vehicles to exit accident spots.",

      "abstract": "INFORE EU H2020 project has the objective of developing a real-time, interactive extreme-scale analytics and forecasting system capable of handling and analysing massive data streams. The system is validated in three different real-world use cases, In this paper we describe one of them, presenting the development of the INFORE system for a coastal surveillance Maritime Situational Awareness (MSA) application. The MSA INFORE system exploits the synergy between global view (AIS data, ESA Sentinel satellite data), providing contextual information over a wider area, and local view produced by a sensorised hybrid robotic network. The network is composed of an RGB/thermal camera onshore and of two Wave Gliders robots equipped with passive sonars. We focus on the development of this network, describing the cooperative autonomy framework to control the robots. The framework enables the robots to make decisions on their navigation for improving vessel detection and tracking. The INFORE MSA network demonstrates the benefits that the synergy between machine learning, AI and autonomous robots can bring in this kind of monitoring systems. The developed autonomy strategies increase the quality of the information produced by robots. These high-quality real-time observations are fused with the global view in the INFORE MSA and decision-support platform. Data fusion from multimodal data sources results crucial for the detection of complex events (e.g. illegal fishing), which can then be communicated to decision-makers. Different modules of the systems are ready and under testing. The whole system will be validated in a trial in 2022.",

      "abstract": "Exploring the oceans, much like space, requires innovative solutions and new technology. The growing demand to protect, exploit and learn about some of our most precious resources calls for particular knowledge and skills to respond to the challenges of a harsh and unforgiving environment. The new Erasmus Mundus Joint Master\u2019s Degree (EMJMD) Programme in Marine and Maritime Intelligent Robotics (MIR) (http://www.master-mir.eu) combines robotics and Artificial Intelligence (AI) to advance marine and maritime science and its technological applications. It aims at building the capacity to enable advances in far reaching sea exploration, autonomous deep sea robots, teleoperations and the use of AI in these endeavours. The MIR programme is shaped to provide training in data science and state of the art applied robotics targeted at enhancing the efficiency, health, safety and environmental performance of the offshore industry and maritime operations. The EMJMD MIR programme offers competitive scholarships to welcome students worldwide and provides them with a common space to develop their shared passion for marine robotics and AI. The programme fosters cultural exchange and sharing of individual experiences. The master\u2019s is conducted by a consortium of 4 well-established academic institutions in the domain of marine robotics research. The institutions are in 4 countries France (UTLN), Norway (NTNU), Portugal (UL-IST) and Spain (UJI), for which the ocean has played a key role in history and is anchored in society. The goal of the programme is to develop specialists in marine and maritime intelligent robotic systems, providing them with: a) a solid theoretical background in the marine physical processes and technical skills in robotics engineering control systems and sensors, b) grounded knowledge in Artificial Intelligence, enabling them to develop cutting edge robotics solutions to real world challenges, c) applied knowledge in subsea and maritime application fields, including blue growth of maritime and offshore sectors, as well as deep sea surveillance, biodiversity monitoring, subsea resources exploration, offshore structure maintenance, e-navigation and maritime security enhancement.Students completing the MIR Masters will be well equipped with skills and state of the art knowledge, enabling them to pursue a career in robotics engineering for the offshore oil and gas, renewable, naval, and maritime sectors. Additionally, the knowledge acquired in the use and function of intelligent robotics for the underwater environment will enable them to easily continue on to a PhD in multiple different fields, should they so desire.The programme was designed to address global challenges identified by the consortium, the gap between industry and academia, the slow convergence of AI and robotics communities and the geopolitical and cultural differences among participating countries. The MIR programme contains a growing worldwide network of more than 58 academic and industrial associate partners spanning more than 21 counmes and covering all oceans. Associate partners participate by providing industry-led lectures, internships, research collaborations and scholarships. Learning-by-doing courses cover the fundamentals of the marine environment, robotics and artificial intelligence, with an emphasis on the interconnections between these fields. A set of transversal skills is developed through courses in languages, scientific writing and entrepreneurship. Furthermore. the MIR consortium organises a yearly symposium hosting presentations from the students\u2019 work, keynotes from distinguished scholars, industry representatives and competitive challenges in AI and robotics.While the first year of the course takes place at UTLN, each student specialises in one of the three study tracks, encompassing a 3rd semester at one of the other main partners\u2019 institutions. Applied robotics for underwater intervention missions (UJI) aims to endow underwater robots with the capability to interact with the environment using manipulators, thus paving the way for the development of advanced systems for close-range underwater infrastructures inspection and maintenance as well as materials sampling. Safe Autonomous subsea operations (NTNU) targets increasing the level of automation and autonomy in routine or otherwise tedious operations which can improve safety, efficiency and performance, supporting the human operator in decision-making and supervision and reducing human workload. Cooperative marine robotics for scientific and commercial applications (IST-UL) focuses on groups of autonomous marine robots working in cooperation, networked via aerial, acoustic, and optical links to dramatically improve the means available for ocean exploration and exploitation at unprecedented temporal and spatial scales.MIR students write a master thesis related to their study track and supervised by one of the main partners and their work is presented at the MIR annual symposium. Graduates receive a double diploma from UTLN and the institution of their study track. The MIR programme fills a gap in the current EU education landscape by responding to a pressing demand for specialists in ocean technology. It does so by building a consortium of actors around the globe with the common goal of advancing education and research in AI and robotics for ocean applications.",

      "abstract": "Transport activities in open-pit mines contribute to a large portion of total energy consumption. Most truck scheduling studies still take a traditional approach to autonomous mining trucks, which does not fully exploit the strengths of the autonomous trucks that can perform more accurate speed control compared to conventional manned trucks. In this paper, a mixed-integer programming model is developed for joint optimization of autonomous truck trips and speed to reduce fuel consumption. To solve the integrated scheduling model, a new tabu search algorithm is proposed, which consists of two stages, where an allocation model is formulated in the upper stage to identify the optimal truck flow, and in the lower stage a tabu search algorithm is developed initialized with the guidance of optimal truck flow. A coal mine in Inner Mongolia is used for example to analyze and verify the effectiveness of the proposed model and solution techniques.",

      "abstract": "Intelligent maritime situational awareness pursues an effective understanding of the majority of the activities related to the maritime domain (impacting the safety, security, economy, or environment), with the aid of artificial intelligence systems. Such an understanding requires the development of automated processes capable of not only detecting abnormal behavior but also of visually-representing and interpreting it. Although much progress has been made in anomaly detection and visualization using vessel self-reporting positioning data, there have been no corresponding advances using video data, despite the increasing use of cameras for maritime surveillance. In this work, we introduce a framework which goes beyond vessel tracking for anomaly detection in video, and is therefore applicable to scenes with a high density of vessels. The proposed framework detects abnormal behavior using a Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) and interprets this knowledge using metrics derived from clustering the positions and courses provided by an independent vessel/motion detector. These detections are geovisualized using an advanced displaying tool where detected abnormal behavior may be localized on the globe, providing an infrastructure for intelligent maritime situational awareness.",

      "abstract": "To prevent terror attacks in which trucks are used as weapons as happened in Nice or Berlin in 2016, the European Project Autonomous Emergency Maneuvering and Movement Monitoring for Road Transport Security (TransSec) was launched in 2018. One crucial point of this project is the development of a map-aiding approach for the localization of vehicles on digital maps, so that the information in digital map data can be used to detect prohibited driving maneuvers, such as off-road or wrong-way drivers. For example, a lane-level map-aiding approach is required for wrong-way driver detection. Navigation Data Standard (NDS) is one of the worldwide map standards developed by several automobile manufacturers. So far, there is no lane-level NDS map covers a large area, therefore, it was decided to use the latest available NDS map without lane level accuracy. In this paper, a lane-level map-aiding approach based on a non-lane-level NDS map is presented. Due to the inaccuracy of vehicle position and digital map the map-aiding does not always provide the correct results, so probabilities of off-road and wrong-way diver detection are estimated to support risk estimation. The performance of the developed map-aiding approach is comprehensively evaluated with both real and simulated trajectories.",

      "abstract": "Sonobuoy fields, comprising a network of sonar transmitters and receivers, are used to search for and track underwater targets. Although normally such fields are operated from a maritime patrol aircraft, automated scheduling and processing creates opportunities for employing them as autonomous sensor systems. The automated search mechanism considered in this work is controlled by modelling the presence of undetected threats in an Operational Area (OA) using a spatial probability density function (PDF), known as a threat map. The algorithm decides how to schedule waveform transmissions, known as pings, to efficiently search and clear the OA. A conventional approach is to update the threat map based on just the characteristics of the sonobuoy field and switch to a separate metric to track a target after track confirmation. In this study we address the phase when there are potential contacts which cannot yet be promoted to confirmed tracks. We develop a mechanism for probing the associated areas of interest while still remaining in the threat map driven search scheduling. To this end, we propose reinitialising the threat map after each transmission using an augmented PDF, where unconfirmed tracks are represented by weighted Gaussians. Simulations show that this approach significantly improves search performance, reducing the number of pings required to confirm a track, distance from a confirmed track to the target and the proportion of falsely confirmed tracks.",

      "abstract": "The significance of efficient monitoring and control of marine traffic for the purpose of safety and security of the ships cannot be overemphasized in the current scenario where global trade and commerce is at its pinnacle. Various stakeholders are concerned with serious maritime issues related to hijacking of ships, illegal fishing, encroachments of sea borders, and illicit exchange of sea cargo, accidents, and military attacks. This requires an automated, accurate, fast, and robust sea monitoring system which can avoid or mitigate the negative effects of such issues. This paper proposes, implements, and evaluates a CNN based deep learning model which can accurately identify ships from the images captured from satellite images. Two models CNN Model 1 and CNN Model 2 having different architectures are trained, validated, and tested on the Airbus satellite images dataset. Both classification accuracy and loss functions are measured by varying the number of the epochs. Also, the complexity comparison of the two models is performed by measuring the training time. The paper concludes that the proposed models are automatic, fast and accurate in terms of their performance on the Airbus dataset by achieving a maximum accuracy of 89.7%.",

      "abstract": "The current advancement of robotics, especially in Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS), leads to a prominent combination between the mining industry and connected-embedded technologies. This progress has arisen in the form of state-of-the-art automated giant vehicles with Autonomous Haulage Systems (AHS) that can transport ore without human intervention. Like CPS, AHS enable autonomous and/or remote control of physical systems (e.g., mining trucks). Thus, similar to CPS, AHS are also susceptible to cyber attacks such as Wi-Fi De-Auth and GPS attacks. With the use of the AHS, several mining activities have been strengthened due to increasing the efficiency of operations. Such activities require ensuring accurate data collection from which precise information about the state of the mine should be generated in a timely and consistent manner. Consequently, the presence of secure and reliable communications is crucial in making AHS mines safer, productive, and sustainable. This paper aims to identify and discuss the relation between safety of AHS in the mining environment and both cybersecurity and communication as well as highlighting their challenges and open issues. We survey the literature that addressed this aim and discuss its pros and cons and then highlight some open issues. We conclude that addressing cybersecurity issues of AHS can ensure the safety of operations in the mining environment as well as providing reliable communication, which will lead to better safety. Additionally, it was found that new communication technologies, such 5G and LTE, could be adopted in AHS-based systems for mining, but further research is needed to considered related cybersecurity issues and attacks.",

      "abstract": "Incidents of hydraulic or oil spills in the oceans/seas or ports occur with some regularity during the exploitation, production and transportation of petroleum products. Immediate, safe, effective and environmentally friendly measures must be adopted to reduce the impact of the oil spill on marine life. Due to the difficulty to detect and clean these areas, semi-autonomous vehicles can make a significant contribution by implementing a cooperative and coordinated response. The paper proposes a concept study of Hybrid Monitoring Detection and Cleaning System (HMDCS-UV) for a maritime region using semi-autonomous unmanned vehicles. This system is based on a cooperative decision architecture for an unmanned aerial vehicle to monitor and detect dirty zones (i.e., hydraulic spills), and clean them up using a swarm of unmanned surface vehicles. The proposed solutions were implemented in a real cloud and were evaluated using different simulation scenarios. Experimental results show that the proposed HMDCS-UV can detect and reduce the level of hydraulic pollution in maritime regions with a significant gain in terms of energy consumption.",

      "abstract": "Due to the vulnerability of deep neural networks to adversarial examples, numerous works on adversarial attacks and defenses have been burgeoning over the past several years. However, there seem to be some conventional views regarding adversarial attacks and object detection approaches that most researchers take for granted. In this work, we bring a fresh perspective on those procedures by evaluating the impact of universal perturbations on object detection at a class-level. We apply it to a carefully curated data set related to autonomous driving. We use Faster-RCNN object detector on images of five different categories: person, car, truck, stop sign and traffic light from the COCO data set, while carefully perturbing the images using Universal Dense Object Suppression algorithm. Our results indicate that person, car, traffic light, truck and stop sign are resilient in that order (most to least) to universal perturbations. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first time such a ranking has been established which is significant for the security of the data sets pertaining to autonomous vehicles and object detection in general.",

      "abstract": "The boom in the electronics industry has made a variety of credit card-sized computer systems and plenty of accompanying sensing and acting elements widely available, at continuously diminishing cost and size levels. The benefits of this situation for agriculture are not left unexploited and thus, more accurate, efficient and environmentally-friendly systems are making the scene. In this context, there is an increasing interest in affordable, small-scale agricultural robots. A key factor for success is the balanced selection of innovative hardware and software components, among the plethora being available. This work describes exactly the steps for designing, implementing and testing a small autonomous electric vehicle, able to follow the farmer during the harvesting activities and to carry the fruits/vegetables from the plant area to the truck location. Quite inexpensive GPS and IMU units, assisted by hardware-accelerated machine vision, speech recognition and networking techniques can assure the fluent operation of a prototype vehicle exhibiting elementary automatic control functionality. The whole approach also highlights the challenges for achieving a truly working solution and provides directions for future exploitation and improvements.",

To this end, the research applies the high-resolution datasets GEBCO and ETOPO1 and ETOPO5 for modelling of the submarine relief. This allows taking into account the 2D and 3D shape deviations in the geomorphology of the two selected segments of the trenches by transecting a series of the cross-section profiles. A scripting algorithm of spatial data processing based on the GMT techniques visualised the topography of the submarine objects in 2D and 3D forms and extracted the topographic data from raster grids for statistical analysis of depth using the cross-section transect profiles of both trenches. The bathymetry of the Mariana Trench was evaluated in the southern segment located near the Challenger Deep area, southwest of Guam Island, in comparison with the segment of the Philippine Trench, which was transected in the surroundings of Mindanao Island. The study presented a comparative submarine geomorphic modelling and spatial analysis of the Philippine Sea basin area. The bathymetric analysis of the relief in the Mariana and Philippine trenches showed effective performance of the GMT scripting toolset in advanced cartographic data analysis and visualisation.",

      "abstract": "This paper proposes the engagement model and optimal task assignment algorithm for small-UAV swarm operations in hostile maritime environments. To alleviate the complexity of a real engagement environment, several assumptions are made: in the proposed engagement model, a vessel can attack the UAV within a certain range with a constant kill probability rate; and the ability of a vessel to attack UAVs is reduced if the multiple UAVs are involved. The objective function for optimal task assignment is constructed from the engagement model which estimates the total damage to vessels as the engagement outcome. Considering computational time and non-convex nature of the optimization problem, a heuristic approach, SL-PSO (social-learning particle swarm optimization), is adopted to maximize the objective function. In particular, a modified SL-PSO approach is introduced to deal with the optimization problem in a discrete domain. Numerical simulation results for two scenarios are presented to analyze the characteristics of the proposed engagement model and the performance of the optimal task assignment algorithm in the given environment.",

      "abstract": "Today\u2019s shipping industry is largely digitalized and networked, but by no means immune to cyber attacks. As recent incidents show, attacks, particularly those targeting on the misleading of navigation, not only pose a serious risk from an economic perspective when disrupting maritime value chains, but can also cause collisions and endanger the environment and humans. However, cyber defense has not yet been an integral part of maritime systems engineering, nor are there any automated tools to systematically assess their security level as well-established in other domains. In this paper, we therefore present a holistic BRidge Attack Tool (BRAT) that interactively offers various attack implementations targeting the communication of nautical data in maritime systems. This provides system engineers with a tool for security assessments of integrated bridge systems, enabling the identification of potential cyber vulnerabilities during the design phase. Moreover, it facilitates the development and validation of an effective cyber defense.",

      "abstract": "Platooning technology, the linking of two or more trucks traveling together in convoy through the wireless connection and autonomous driving technology, has been recently getting interested as it potentially reduces fuel consumption and emission, a globally concerned subject for many decades, and enhances road safety, thus achieving efficient and safe transport. Recent studies have proved that driving in platoons with a safe small inter-vehicle distance significantly reduces fuel consumption as a consequence of reduced aerodynamic drag. Reducing fuel consumption means a longer driving range, which is particularly valuable for electric vehicles since it takes more time to recharge the battery. By exploiting the different fuel consumption rates of vehicles in different positions in a platoon, this paper proposes efficient sequence change algorithms to increase the driving range of the platoon. The proposed methods change sequences of trucks in such a way that each one can consume almost the same amount of fuel until fuel shortage. Through simulations, we show that our proposed algorithms help improve fuel-saving, thus increasing the driving range of the platoon compared to the one without sequence change.",

      "abstract": "Prognostics is an engineering discipline focused on predicting the time at which a system or a component will no longer perform its intended function. Due to the requirements of system safety and reliability, the correct diagnosis or prognosis of abnormal condition plays a vital role in the maintenance of industrial systems. It is expected that new requirements in regard to autonomous ships will push suppliers of maritime equipment to provide more insight into the conditions of their systems. One of the stated challenges with these systems is having enough run-to-failure examples to build accurate-enough prognostic models. Due to the scarcity of enough reliable data, transfer learning is established as a successful approach to improve and reduce the need to labelled examples. Transfer learning has shown excellent capabilities in image classification problems. Little work has been done to explore and exploit the use of transfer learning in prognostics. In this paper, various deep learning models are used to predict the remaining useful life (RUL) of air compressors. Here, transfer learning is applied by building a separate prognostics model trained on turbofan engines. It has been found that several of the explored transfer learning architectures were able to improve the predictions on air compressors. The research results suggest transfer learning as a promising research field towards more accurate and reliable prognostics.",

      "abstract": "Unmanned maritime systems (UMS) can provide important benefits for maritime law enforcement agencies for tasks such as area surveillance and patrolling, especially when they are able to work together as one coordinated system. In this context, this paper proposes a methodology that optimises the coverage of a fleet of UMS, thereby maximising the opportunities for identifying threats. Unlike traditional approaches to maritime coverage optimisation, which are also used, for example, in search and rescue operations when searching for victims at sea, this approach takes into consideration the limited seaworthiness of small UMS, compared with traditional large ships, by incorporating the danger level into the design of the optimiser.",

      "abstract": "In this tutorial, a new class of attitude estimation solutions is presented to determine the orientation of a robotic platform resorting only to a set of triaxial gyroscopes and an additional measurement of a constant inertial vector. This approach poses a significant advantage in terms of setup design and reduced mission costs since only one inertial measurement is required, in contrast with existing solutions that require at least two of these. Pertinent examples of viable applications include navigation of submarines or large ships, assisting autonomous robots in precise maneuvers, inertial platform stabilization, etc. The novelty of the solutions proposed herein exploit the well-known inertial information about the Earth\u2019s angular velocity by using high-grade gyroscopes that are sensitive to the planet\u2019s spin. Experimental results are presented to demonstrate the good performance achieved by the algorithms.",

      "abstract": "Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), especially fixed-wing ones that withstand strong winds, have great potential for oceanic exploration and research. This paper studies a UAV-aided maritime data collection system with a fixed-wing UAV dispatched to collect data from marine buoys. We aim to minimize the UAV's energy consumption in completing the task by jointly optimizing the communication time scheduling among the buoys and the UAV's flight trajectory subject to wind effect, which is a non-convex problem and difficult to solve optimally. Existing techniques such as the successive convex approximation (SCA) method provide efficient sub-optimal solutions for collecting small/moderate data volume, whereas the solution heavily relies on the trajectory initialization and has not explicitly considered the wind effect, while the computational complexity and resulted trajectory complexity both become prohibitive for the task with large data volume. To this end, we propose a new cyclical trajectory design framework that can handle arbitrary data volume efficiently subject to wind effect. Specifically, the proposed UAV trajectory comprises multiple cyclical laps, each responsible for collecting only a subset of data and thereby significantly reducing the computational/trajectory complexity, which allows searching for better trajectory initialization that fits the buoys' topology and the wind. Numerical results show that the proposed cyclical scheme outperforms the benchmark one-flight-only scheme in general. Moreover, the optimized cyclical 8-shape trajectory can proactively exploit the wind and achieve lower energy consumption compared with the case without wind.",

      "abstract": "Smart farming also known as precision agriculture is gaining more traction for its promising potential to fulfill increasing global food demand and supply. In a smart farm, technologies and connected devices are used in a variety of ways, from finding the real-time status of crops and soil moisture content to deploying drones to assist with tasks such as applying pesticide spray. However, the use of heterogeneous internet-connected devices has introduced numerous vulnerabilities within the smart farm ecosystem. Attackers can exploit these vulnerabilities to remotely control and disrupt data flowing from/to on-field sensors and autonomous vehicles like smart tractors and drones. This can cause devastating consequences especially during a high-risk time, such as harvesting, where live-monitoring is critical. In this paper, we demonstrate a Denial of Service (DoS) attack that can hinder the functionality of a smart farm by disrupting deployed on-field sensors. In particular, we discuss a Wi-Fi deauthentication attack that exploits IEEE 802.11 vulnerabilities, where the management frames are not encrypted. A MakerFocus ESP8266 Development Board WiFiDeauther Monster is used to detach the connected Raspberry Pi from the network and prevent sensor data from being sent to the remote cloud. Additionally, this attack was expanded to include the entire network, obstructing all devices from connecting to the network. To this end, we urge practitioners to be aware of current vulnerabilities when deploying smart farming ecosystems and encourage the cyber-security community to further investigate the domain-specific characteristics of smart farming.",

The design method of the anti-submarine warfare module of the unmanned surface vehicle is quite different from the traditional anti-submarine weapon system of manned combat platforms. According to the characteristics of the unmanned anti-submarine warfare, the anti-submarine warfare module is designed. It is introduced of the composition and configuration of the anti-submarine warfare module, and it is discussed of the variable autonomous control structure and the modular replacement of the antisubmarine warfare module. The sea experiment shows that the anti-submarine warfare module can complete the full antisubmarine mission which consists of detection and attack to the submarine under the mode of the remote control and the autonomous mode, and it greatly reduces the requirement for wireless communication bandwidth. It also can be quickly modularly replaced in the unmanned surface vehicle.",

      "abstract": "In addition to marine satellites, shore-based terrestrial base stations (TBSs) and unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) can be exploited to provide broadband communication services in the offshore area. TBSs should be deployed only at available sites, e.g., mountains with both power grid and optical fibers. UAVs can work only in the area with fine weather conditions. These practical constraints render the topology of an offshore hybrid UAV-terrestrial network quite irregular, leading to blind zones of coverage. To solve this problem, we consider on-demand coverage optimization of maritime hybrid satellite-UAV-terrestrial networks. We maximize the minimum user rate served by TBSs and UAVs, while guaranteeing the leakage interference to satellite users below an affordable threshold. The problem is non-convex. We solve it by using the random matrix theory and successive convex optimization tools. Simulation results demonstrate that the coverage performance in the offshore area can be significantly improved by using the proposed optimization scheme.",

      "abstract": "The ocean is classified into several territorial regimes that span from internal waters, archipelagic waters, territorial seas, contiguous zones, exclusive economic zones (EEZ), and high seas. The relevant state authorities must perform surveillance of all ships that navigate through their respective territories to ensure the ship safety and prevent them from carrying out illegal activities such as illegal unregulated and unreported (IUU) fishing, illegal firearms smuggling, and piracy. Currently, maritime domain surveillance is carried out using a combination of Automatic Identification System (AIS), Coastal Radar System (CRS), and Long Range Camera (LRC). The massive amount of incoming data from these surveillance systems produce big maritime data. However, big maritime data is useless without artificial intelligence intervention. This research proposed an intelligent system that provides and analyzes ship path planning, identifies suspicious ships, track ships, and approaches and attacks target ships using unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) swarm. Artificial intelligence-based surveillance systems are developed in a single Integrated Coastal Marine Monitoring System, which is expected to perform quickly, precisely, and comprehensively.",

Therefore, this paper proposes a methodology that optimizes the coverage of a fleet of unmanned maritime systems, and thereby maximizes the chances of noticing threats. Unlike traditional approaches for maritime coverage optimization, which are also used for example in search and rescue operations when searching for victims at sea, this approaches takes into consideration the limited seaworthiness of small unmanned systems, as compared to traditional large ships, by incorporating the danger level in the design of the optimizer.",

For the UUV's power system, fuel cell and battery hybrid system capable of long submersion time and high efficiency have been widely developed. In the fuel cell and battery hybrid system, energy efficiency can be improved by power split optimization according to the power demand from UUV that changes in real time. The optimization process allows each battery and fuel cell system to be operated at the optimal point. In case of submarine, since the operation scenario is limited to a few and it mostly operates within a given mission scenario, dynamic programming method can be an efficient optimization method. Therefore, in this paper, we are introducing 30-day operational UUV fuel cell-battery system under development. And also, we found optimal operating point of fuel cell and battery system through dynamic programming method.",

      "abstract": "In this emerging era of great power competition, the goal of outpacing potential adversaries in the development of military technology takes on a new urgency. Evolving capabilities in sensing and automation are driven by a trade space that includes range and lethality versus close engagement and survivability; finders versus hiders; centralized command/control versus asset independence/dispersion; and planning and judgement versus reaction and autonomy. This paper explores this trade space first by describing sensing and automation innovations demonstrated during the 1990/1991 Gulf War and shortly thereafter, followed by discussion on current and emerging game-changing technologies. Capabilities projected for near and far term advantage include: weapons systems ensuring long-range lethality; unmanned cooperative networks of offboard systems; artificial intelligence and machine learning; and exploitation of advanced materials and quantum technologies. These will play a vital role in realizing a networked force of manned and unmanned systems with the ability to sense, comprehend, communicate, predict, plan, and take appropriate action in the future maritime environment.",

      "abstract": "The advancement of hardware and software technology makes multiple cooperative unmanned surface vehicles (USVs) utilized in maritime escorting with low cost and high efficiency. USVs can work as edge computing devices to locally and cooperatively perform heavy computational tasks without dependence of remote cloud servers. As such, we organize a team of USVs to escort a high value ship (e.g., mother ship) in a complex maritime environment with hostile intruder ships, where the significant challenge is to learn cooperation of USVs and assign each USV tasks to achieve optimal performance. To this end, in this paper, a hierarchical scheme is proposed for the USV team to guard a valuable ship, which belongs to problems of sparse rewards and long-time horizons in multi-agent reinforcement learning. The core idea utilized in the proposed scheme is centralized training with decentralized execution, where USVs learn policies to guard a high-value ship with extra shared environmental data from other USVs through communication. Specifically, the ships are divided into two groups, i.e., high-level ship and low-level USVs. The high-level ship optimizes decision-level policy to predict intercept points, while each low-level USV utilizes multi-agent reinforcement learning to learn task-level policy to intercept intruders. The hierarchical task guidance is exploited in maritime escorting, whereby high-level ship\u2019s decision-level policy guides the training and execution of task-level policies of USVs. Simulation results and experiment analysis show that the proposed hierarchical scheme can efficiently execute the escort mission.",

      "abstract": "<p>Complex maritime missions, both above and below the surface, have traditionally been carried out by manned surface ships and submarines equipped with advanced sensor systems. Unmanned Maritime Vehicles (UMVs) are increasingly demonstrating their potential for improving existing naval capabilities due to their rapid deployability, easy scalability, and high reconfigurability, offering a reduction in both operational time and cost. In addition, they mitigate the risk to personnel by leaving the man far-from-the-risk but in-the-loop of decision making. In the long-term, a clear interoperability framework between unmanned systems, human operators, and legacy platforms will be crucial for effective joint operations planning and execution. However, the present multi-vendor multi-protocol solutions in multi-domain UMVs activities are hard to interoperate without common mission control interfaces and communication protocol schemes. Furthermore, the underwater domain presents significant challenges that cannot be satisfied with the solutions developed for terrestrial networks. In this paper, the interoperability topic is discussed blending a review of the technological growth from 2000 onwards with recent authors' in-field experience; finally, important research directions for the future are given. Within the broad framework of interoperability in general, the paper focuses on the aspect of interoperability among UMVs not neglecting the role of the human operator in the loop. The picture emerging from the review demonstrates that interoperability is currently receiving a high level of attention with a great and diverse deal of effort. Besides, the manuscript describes the experience from a sea trial exercise, where interoperability has been demonstrated by integrating heterogeneous autonomous UMVs into the NATO Centre for Maritime Research and Experimentation (CMRE) network, using different robotic middlewares and acoustic modem technologies to implement a multistatic active sonar system. A perspective for the interoperability in marine robotics missions emerges in the paper, through a discussion of current capabilities, in-field experience and future advanced technologies unique to UMVs. Nonetheless, their application spread is slowed down by the lack of human confidence. In fact, an interoperable system-of-systems of autonomous UMVs will require operators involved only at a supervisory level. As trust develops, endorsed by stable and mature interoperability, human monitoring will be diminished to exploit the tremendous potential of fully autonomous UMVs.</p>",

      "abstract": "Collision avoidance ability is very important for autonomous agricultural vehicles, but the influence of different obstacles in agricultural environment is rarely taken into account. In this paper, a velocity control strategy for collision avoidance was proposed to adjust the velocity of autonomous agricultural vehicles according to the movement state and dangerous degree of the obstacles and the distance between the obstacles and the vehicles, thus to improve intelligence and safety of the vehicles. The control strategy involved two steps: collision prediction in dynamic environments with an improved obstacle space\u2013time grid map, and velocity generator for collision avoidance with a cloud model. Simulations were conducted on the obstacle collision prediction and the designed cloud generator for velocity control respectively. Simulation results show that the proposed strategy can effectively predict collision with anti-disturbance ability for threat-free obstacles and rapid and accurate velocity output. And it realizes the real-time operation in dynamic environments with an average time of 0.2&nbsp;s to predict collision. Additionally, field experiments including five trial schemes were performed to test the proposed velocity control strategy on an agricultural robot, where a haystack, a tractor and walking persons were regarded as static or dynamic obstacles. The results of the field experiments show that the proposed velocity control strategy has strong feasibility and effectiveness.",

      "abstract": "The paper aims at investigating the most adequate strategies to develop efficient Machine Learning solutions for Autonomous Vehicles used for terrestrial, air, and maritime transportation. The development of systems with capabilities of performing some parts or even a full mission by adopting fully autonomous solutions has encouraged the development of new interfaces with human pilots. Standard interfaces are based on traditional systems that require low-level actions, such as the one related to steering and instrument monitoring. Indeed, autonomous transport systems have the capability to develop complex logic solutions to self-generate low-level actions. In this case, the role of the pilot is the development of high-level decisions rather than low-level steering of the vehicle. This condition permits the pilot to focus his workload on the most important issues related to driving the vehicle, thus reducing the risk of distraction determined by low- level steering. Therefore, the type and the layout of the developed interface will exploit recent technologies, such as touchscreens, voice recognition, and synthetic vision. The interaction looks like the one provided when the pilot relates to other humans rather than a machine. This condition is verified if the transport system is provided with Artificial Intelligence solutions based on Machine Learning. The paper discuss proper testing strategies to evaluate the adoption of specific interfaces in replacement of traditional ones. The final goal is to demonstrate the efficiency of the proposed testing strategies to select adequate interfaces that improve the quality and the safety of transportation. Four case studies are discussed to highlight efficient prototypical systems to be used in these applications.",

It is assumed that the cooperative BSs in the BS region broadcast signals to the MSs in the MS region through multiple relay stations (RSs) that are located randomly within the RS region. We utilize the properties of Hilbert space to analyse such systems and provide a contemporary perspective on the transmit diversity and spatial multiplexing transmission techniques. We then propose relay-selection criteria to choose the best relay which maximizes the system signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) and derive asymptotic closed-form expressions of the outage probability in Rayleigh fading. Both the theoretical predictions and numerical modeling clearly indicate that the outage probabilities of the proposed TCRNs are limited by the sizes of the spatial regions and by exploiting spatial diversity, a significant gain in system's SNR is attainable for both transmission techniques.",

      "abstract": "Validation of satellite-based retrieval of ocean parameters like Sea Surface Temperature (SST) and Sea Surface Salinity (SSS) is commonly done via statistical comparison with in situ measurements. Because in situ observations derived from coastal/tropical moored buoys and Argo floats are only representatives of one specific geographical point, they cannot be used to measure spatial gradients of ocean parameters (i.e., two-dimensional vectors). In this study, we exploit the high temporal sampling of the unmanned surface vehicle (USV) Saildrone (i.e., one measurement per minute) and describe a methodology to compare the magnitude of SST and SSS gradients derived from satellite-based products with those captured by Saildrone. Using two Saildrone campaigns conducted in the California/Baja region in 2018 and in the North Atlantic Gulf Stream in 2019, we compare the magnitude of gradients derived from six different GHRSST Level 4 SST (MUR, OSTIA, CMC, K10, REMSS, and DMI) and two SSS (JPLSMAP, RSS40km) datasets. While results indicate strong consistency between Saildrone- and satellite-based observations of SST and SSS, this is not the case for derived gradients with correlations lower than 0.4 for SST and 0.1 for SSS products.",

      "abstract": "The coastal ocean is one of the most important environments on our planet, home to some of the most bio-diverse and productive ecosystems and providing key input to the livelihood of the majority of human society. It is also a highly dynamic and sensitive environment, particularly susceptible to damage from anthropogenic influences such as pollution and over-exploitation as well as the effects of climate change. These have the added potential to exacerbate other anthropogenic effects and the recent change in sea temperature can be considered as the most pervasive and severe cause of impact in coastal ecosystems worldwide. In addition to open ocean measurements, satellite observations of sea surface temperature (SST) have the potential to provide accurate synoptic coverage of this essential climate variable for the near-shore coastal ocean. However, this potential has not been fully realized, mainly because of a lack of reliable in situ validation data, and the contamination of near-shore measurements by the land. The underwater biotechnological park of Crete (UBPC) has been taking near surface temperature readings autonomously since 2014. Therefore, this study investigated the potential for this infrastructure to be used to validate SST measurements of the near-shore coastal ocean. A comparison between in situ data and Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) Aqua and Terra SST data is presented for a four year (2014\u20132018) in situ time series recorded from the UBPC. For matchups between in situ and satellite SST data, only nighttime in situ extrapolated to the sea surface (SSTskin) data within \u00b11 h from the satellite\u2019s overpass are selected and averaged. A close correlation between the in situ data and the MODIS SST was found (squared Pearson correlation coefficient-r2 > 0.9689, mean absolute error-\u0394 < 0.51 both for Aqua and Terra products). Moreover, close correlation was found between the satellite data and their adjacent satellite pixel\u2019s data further from the shore (r2 > 0.9945, \u0394 < 0.23 for both Aqua and Terra products, daytime and nighttime satellite SST). However, there was also a consistent positive systematic difference in the satellite against satellite mean biases indicating a thermal adjacency effect from the land (e.g., mean bias between daytime Aqua satellite SST from the UBPC cell minus the respective adjacent cell\u2019s data is \u03b4 = 0.02). Nevertheless, if improvements are made in the in situ sensors and their calibration and uncertainty evaluation, these initial results indicate that near-shore autonomous coastal underwater temperature arrays, such as the one at UBPC, could in the future provide valuable in situ data for the validation of satellite coastal SST measurements.",

      "abstract": "Underwater communication cables transport large amounts of sensitive information between countries. This fact converts these cables into a critical infrastructure that must be protected. Monitoring the underwater cable environment is rare and any intervention is usually driven by cable faults. In the last few years, several reports raised issues about possible future malicious attacks on such cables. The main objective of this operational research and analysis (ORA) paper is to present an overview of different commercial and already available marine sensor technologies (acoustic, optic, magnetic and oceanographic) that could be used for autonomous monitoring of the underwater cable environment. These sensors could be mounted on different autonomous platforms, such as unmanned surface vehicles (USVs) or autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs). This paper analyses a multi-threat sabotage scenario where surveying a transatlantic cable of 13,000 km, (reaching water depths up to 4000 m) is necessary. The potential underwater threats identified for such a scenario are: divers, anchors, fishing trawls, submarines, remotely operated vehicles (ROVs) and AUVs. The paper discusses the capabilities of the identified sensors to detect such identified threats for the scenario under study. It also presents ideas on the construction of periodic and permanent surveillance networks. Research study and results are focused on providing useful information to decision-makers in charge of designing surveillance capabilities to secure underwater communication cables.",

      "abstract": "Maritime surveillance videos provide crucial on-spot kinematic traffic information (traffic volume, ship speeds, headings, etc.) for varied traffic participants (maritime regulation departments, ship crew, ship owners, etc.) which greatly benefits automated maritime situational awareness and maritime safety improvement. Conventional models heavily rely on visual ship features for the purpose of tracking ships from maritime image sequences which may contain arbitrary tracking oscillations. To address this issue, we propose an ensemble ship tracking framework with a multi-view learning algorithm and wavelet filter model. First, the proposed model samples ship candidates with a particle filter following the sequential importance sampling rule. Second, we propose a multi-view learning algorithm to obtain raw ship tracking results in two steps: extracting a group of distinct ship contour relevant features (i.e., Laplacian of Gaussian, local binary pattern, Gabor filter, histogram of oriented gradient, and canny descriptors) and learning high-level intrinsic ship features by jointly exploiting underlying relationships shared by each type of ship contour features. Third, with the help of the wavelet filter, we performed a data quality control procedure to identify abnormal oscillations in the ship positions which were further corrected to generate the final ship tracking results. We demonstrate the proposed ship tracker\u2019s performance on typical maritime traffic scenarios through four maritime surveillance videos.",

      "abstract": "Crops are an important source of food and other products. In conventional farming, tractors apply large amounts of agrochemicals uniformly across fields for weed control and plant protection. Autonomous farming robots have the potential to provide environment-friendly weed control on a per plant basis. A system that reliably distinguishes crops, weeds, and soil under varying environment conditions is the basis for plant-specific interventions such as spot applications. Such semantic segmentation systems, however, often show a performance decay when applied under new field conditions. In this paper, we therefore propose an effective approach to unsupervised domain adaptation for plant segmentation systems in agriculture and thus to adapt existing systems to new environments, different value crops, and other farm robots. Our system yields a high segmentation performance in the target domain by exploiting labels only from the source domain. It is based on CycleGANs and enforces a semantic consistency domain transfer by constraining the images to be pixel-wise classified in the same way before and after translation. We perform an extensive evaluation, which indicates that we can substantially improve the transfer of our semantic segmentation system to new field environments, different crops, and different sensors or robots.",

This paper suggests that results from UKF fusion is unsatisfactory for USVs\u2019 relatively smooth path due to UKF\u2019s lack of versatility. Hence, it is proposed here that by replacing the UKF with Interacting Multiple Model (IMM), estimation results will better represent USV\u2019s movement. Furthermore, this paper proposes slight modification to the IMM in order to heighten the algorithm\u2019s confidence in switching modes. By exploiting angular velocity information from Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU), an independent mode probability can be obtained which is then injected into the IMM. Computer simulations based on maritime operations were done to show that the proposed IMU-based IMM is able to react faster to mode changes, giving more reliable outcomes.",

In this paper, we describe the cooperative autonomy used to control the Autonomous Underwater Vehicles (AUVs) acting as sonar receiver nodes in the CMRE Anti-Submarine Warfare (ASW) network. The paper focuses on a track management module that was integrated in the robot autonomy software for enabling the share of information. Track to track (T2T) associations are used for improving track classification and for creating a common tactical picture, necessary for AUV cooperative strategies. We also present a new cooperative data-driven AUV behaviour that exploits the spatial diversity of multiple robots for improving target tracking and for facilitating T2T associations. We report results with real data collected at sea that validate the approach. The reported results are one of the first examples that show the potential of cooperative autonomy and data fusion in realistic underwater surveillance scenarios characterised by limited communications.",

      "abstract": "The capability to detect changes in an underwater scene has many applications, including environmental monitoring, surveillance of strategic maritime waterways, and naval mine countermeasures. This paper examines the automated detection of changes in repeat-pass synthetic aperture sonar (SAS) imagery by exploiting the loss of phase coherence caused by differences in the scene. A renavigation method based on track registration is developed for performing the coregistration of images. The method first determines the corrections to be applied to the repeat-pass navigation data by optimizing a linear track model using the estimated across-track pixel displacements. A second optimization is then performed using the along-track pixel displacements to determine a velocity correction for each ping location of the repeat-pass image to compensate for residual motion errors. The corrected navigation solution is then used to rebeamform the repeat-pass image onto the same focal points as the reference image. The method is demonstrated on a pair of repeat-pass SAS images acquired using the AquaPix INSAS2 sonar, where it is shown that it is not necessary to have access to raw element data to coregister images accurately enough for coherent change detection requirements. This technique is then applied to the second data set obtained using the HISAS 1030 sonar for the purpose of comparing both coherent and noncoherent (amplitude-only) approaches to change detection in scenes with low and high clutters. False alarms caused by the acoustic shadows of objects in high-clutter areas are mitigated using the single-pass interferometric coherence as a reference mask. The results show the successful use of the repeat-pass coherence to detect changes between SAS images with temporal baselines of several days on scenes consisting of mud, gravel, and sand, and demonstrate that a coherent approach is capable of detecting large-scale differences (caused by the introduction or removal of targets) as well as subtle scene changes that are not detectable using noncoherent methods.",

The present study reviews the results of a survey conducted worldwide amongst the students of maritime universities. The students were asked about their understanding of autonomous merchant ships and an attitude towards them. The study finds that the vast majority of interviewees claims to have an average or below average knowledge of the topic, and perceive automation as a factor increasing safety at sea, while threatening seafaring jobs. The results suggest that the topic of autonomous shipping should be more touched upon in curriculums of maritime universities, as the students appear to have a limited understanding of what can potentially become a future of their prospective occupation.",

Firstly, performances of Airbus Zephyr S HAPS (Solar High Altitude Pseudo-Satellite), Tekever AR5 Life Ray Evolution and the AR3 Net Ray medium altitude unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) have been analysed. Then, ECA Group A18 and A9 autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs) features have been presented. The strengths, weaknesses, opportunities and threats (SWOT) approach is applied to position appropriately these UAVs and AUVs in the context of maritime security operations. The need for further investigation in the field is reveiled as well. The analysed vehicles are assets deployed with the Europen Commission\u2019s (EC) COMPASS2020 project and tested over European seas.",

      "abstract": "The continuous growth in maritime traffic and recent developments towards autonomous navigation have directed increasing attention to navigational safety in which new tools are required to identify real-time risk and complex navigation situations. These tools are of paramount importance to avoid potentially disastrous consequences of accidents and promote safe navigation at sea. In this study, an adaptive ship-safety-domain is proposed with spatial risk functions to identify both collision and grounding risk based on motion and maneuverability conditions for all vessels. The algorithm is designed and validated through extensive amounts of Automatic Identification System (AIS) data for decision support over a large area, while the integration of the algorithm with other navigational systems will increase effectiveness and ensure reliability. Since a successful evacuation of a potential vessel-to-vessel collision, or a vessel grounding situation, is highly dependent on the nearby maneuvering limitations and other possible accident situations, multi-vessel collision and grounding risk is considered in this work to identify real-time risk. The presented algorithm utilizes and exploits dynamic AIS information, vessel registry and high-resolution maps and it is robust to inaccuracies of position, course and speed over ground records. The computation-efficient algorithm allows for real-time situation risk identification at a large-scale monitored map up to country level and up to several years of operation with a very high accuracy.",

      "abstract": "The autonomous boat in this research has the capability of using fully renewable energy sources in which its wing sail can provide aerodynamic forces for propulsion while the solar cells provide the power for control and communication systems. Thus, this boat can operate in a long duration, suitable for ocean research and monitoring missions. Similar to an airplane wing, the design of the wing sail is taken from NACA 0018 that can provide good performance in low Reynolds-number. The purpose of this study is to experimentally study the aerodynamic performance of a 1/4th scale wing sail by varying the flap angle in a laboratory set-up. The aerodynamic of wing sail produces lift and drag forces that depend on the wing sail angle of attack. In this study, an encoder is used to measure the angle of attack of wing sail, a potentiometer for measuring the flap angle, and an anemometer for measuring the wind speed. A servo motor is used for controlling the flap angle. The digital data acquisition uses Arduino Uno as the microcontroller which is wired to a PC and coded in MATLAB/Simulink using Arduino package. The experiment results show the wing sail performance, the effect varying flap angles. The total aerodynamic forces were generated in this experiment.",

Most of consumer and professional robotic systems are affected by multiple vulnerabilities and the research in this field is just started. This paper addresses the problem of automatic detection of anomalous behaviors possibly coming from cyber-security attacks. The proposed solution is based on extracting system logs from a set of internal variables of a robotic system, on transforming such data into images, and on training different Autoencoder architectures to classify robot behaviors to detect anomalies. Experimental results in two different scenarios (autonomous boats and social robots) show effectiveness and general applicability of the proposed method.",

      "abstract": "In recent years, unmanned surface vehicles (USVs) have made important advances in civil, maritime, and military applications. With the continuous improvement of autonomy, the increasing complexity of tasks, and the emergence of various types of advanced sensors, higher requirements are imposed on the computing performance of USV clusters, especially for latency sensitive tasks. However, during the execution of marine operations, due to the relative movement of the USV cluster nodes and the network topology of the cluster, the wireless channel states are changing rapidly, and the computing resources of cluster nodes may be available or unavailable at any time. It is difficult to accurately predict in advance. Therefore, we propose an optimized offloading mechanism based on the classic multi-armed bandit (MAB) theory. This mechanism enables USV cluster nodes to dynamically make offloading decisions by learning the potential computing performance of their neighboring team nodes to minimize average computation task offloading delay. It is an optimized algorithm named Adaptive Upper Confidence Boundary (AUCB) algorithm, and corresponding simulations are designed to evaluate the performance. The algorithm enables the USV cluster to effectively adapt to the marine vehicular fog computing networks, balancing the trade-off between exploration and exploitation (EE). The simulation results show that the proposed algorithm can quickly converge to the optimal computation task offloading combination strategy under heavy and light input data loads.",

Challenges such as UUG mission collection requirements provided by final users and mission submission to UUGs operating in remote sites are approached. Solutions are proposed for these challenges. A web interface created in the GliderC2 scientific/experimental facility available at NATO STO CMRE (Center for Maritime Research and Experimentation) was created to approach these challenges. The web interface and proposed approach for mission submission to a UUG of a given fleet of UUGs was tested in two different sites: the experimental campaign Nordic Recognized Environmental Picture 2017 (NREP17) in the South of Iceland, where the UUGs were deployed, and the NATO Coalition Warrior Interoperability Exercise 2017 (CWIX17) in Poland, where the final users were able to provide the mission requirements, generate the UUG tasking and submit it for execution. Results demonstrate how these challenges were approached and solved. Illustrations of mission executions in other NATO and National C4ISR capabilities are provided, demonstrating the high level of interoperability reached by the GliderC2 in the Joint ISR process TCPED (Tasking, Collection, Dissemination, Exploitation and Dissemination). Ideas for further work are provided at the end of this paper, stimulating the continuation of this work.",

      "abstract": "Environment perception plays a vital role in autonomous systems. Different sensory channels are exploited to capture a rich and a dynamic grasp of the surrounding to enable safe and efficient navigation. In this work, scene understanding in maritime environments is tackled using an obstacle detection and tracking procedure based on a video camera and a LIDAR (range sensor). We rely on state-of-the-art object detection CNN (Convolutional neural network) YOLO to detect obstacles in the image plane and we propose an efficient object tracking procedure to track objects across frames. LIDAR point clouds are used to locate obstacles in the world reference frame and thus, to derive a scene map with the obstacles and their headings which is used as an input to a path planning algorithm. the procedure is tested using data acquired from an unmanned surface vessel and typical metrics in object detection and tracking communities are used to evaluate our method. The results demonstrate improvement we achieve over the object detector baseline and other similar online tracking methods.",

      "abstract": "The fifth generation mobile communication system (5G) is designed to have new radio capabilities to support not only conventional enhanced Mobile Broadband (eMBB) communications but also new machine type communications such as Ultra-Reliable Low-Latency communications (URLLC) and massive Machine Type communications (mMTC). In such new areas of URLLC and mMTC, mobile operators need to explore new use cases and/or applications together with vertical industries, the industries which are potential users of 5G, in order to fully exploit the new 5G capabilities. Intelligent Transport System (ITS), including automated driving, is one of the most promising application areas of 5G since it requires low-latency communications. We are actively working on the research and development of truck platooning as a new 5G application. We have developed a field trial system for vehicular-to- network (V2N) communications using 5G prototype equipment and actual large-size trucks in order to assess 5G capabilities, including ultra-low- latency, in automotive test courses in the field. The paper addresses the field evaluation results of 5G V2N communications in a rural area. It clarifies the fundamental radio propagation issues at the leading and the following vehicles in truck platooning for V2N communications.",

      "abstract": "In recent years, unmanned surface vehicles (USVs) have made important advances in civil, maritime, and military applications. With the continuous improvement of autonomy, the increasing complexity of tasks, and the emergence of various types of advanced sensors, higher requirements are imposed on the computing performance of USVs clusters, especially for latency sensitive tasks. Therefore, this paper proposes a fog-cloud computing architecture for USVs clusters, which dynamically allocates USVs cluster computing resources and cloud computing resources to achieve overall optimized computing performance. However, due to the mobility of USVs cluster nodes, the network topology, the wireless channel states and the available computing resources are changing rapidly and difficult to predict. In this work, we develop a learning-based task offloading framework using the multi-armed bandit (MAB) theory, which enables vehicles to learn the potential task offloading performance of its neighboring team nodes with excessive computing resources, and minimizes the average offloading delay. We propose an adaptive upper confidence bound (AUCB) algorithm and augment it with load-awareness and occurrence-awareness, by redesigning the utility function of the classic MAB algorithms. The proposed AUCB algorithm can effectively adapt to the dynamic marine fog computing environment, balance the tradeoff between exploration and exploitation in the learning process, and converge fast to the optimal computing nodes with theoretical performance guarantee. Simulations under synthetic scenario are carried out, showing that the proposed algorithm achieves close-to-optimal delay performance under both heavy and light input data load.",

      "abstract": "Robotics networks for underwater surveillance applications offer the promise for the desired monitoring at lower costs than traditional approaches based on manned assets. Autonomy and networking are crucial aspects to consider in order to overcome the challenges typical of the marine environment, such as the limitations in underwater communications. This paper addresses both these aspects, describing the cooperative autonomy architecture and the strategies of the AUVs of the CMRE Anti-Submarine Warfare (ASW) network. We report tests from the LCAS18 trial. In this trial, cooperative strategies were supported by data sharing, facilitating track classification and the creation of a common tactical picture. The CMRE intelligent Cooperative Autonomous Decision Making Engine (iCADME) controlled the various phases of the robot mission. The produced tracks were classified in real-time and the ones likely to be generated by a target were selected to trigger a cooperative track prosecution strategy. The final objective was to facilitate track-to-track associations for the final target confirmation. To support cooperative autonomy, in LCAS18, the novel CMRE Cognitive Communication Architecture (CCA) was used in the CMRE ASW network for the first time. CCA managed the communications, with the aim of improving the use of the available bandwidth.The results from LCAS18 are one of the first examples in literature demonstrating the potentials of cooperative autonomy strategies and data fusion in realistic surveillance scenarios. Only autonomous decisions can in fact improve the mission performance when a reliable communication channel with the Command and Control centre cannot be guaranteed. Furthermore, cooperative decisions and data sharing allow to exploit the spatial diversity that robotic networks can provide.",

The proposed tool is implemented using a modular approach and provides the maximum range of the UAV network, depending on the number of UAVs, on the video data rate of each UAV, and on the number of simultaneous video transmissions. Two application scenarios in maritime environments are specifically considered: 1) collaborative search and tracking of targets and 2) circular formation flight for detection of external threats to ship convoys. Numerical simulations are presented, allowing to characterize the performance of the network. Preliminary flight test results using two ANTEX-X02 UAVs from the Portuguese Air Force (PoAF) are also included.",

      "abstract": "This paper offers an analytical discussion on the terminology and timeframes related to the future of shipping. The discussion is based on issues that have surfaced within the Swedish research project Autonomy and responsibility. The paper argues that the concept \u2018autonomous ships\u2019 has become an indicator of that seafarers soon will become obsolete \u2013 which may have negative consequences for the supply of maritime competence in coming years - and that the proper definition of the term \u2018autonomous\u2019 describes something that will never apply to a ship. Ships can be given the possibility, but hardly the full right or condition of self-government. It is argued that \u2018smart ships\u2019, or perhaps \u2018intelligent ships\u2019, are more appropriate, since these terms describe the current and future state of technology without predicting how humans will prefer to use it. The estimated timeframes for implementation of unmanned ships suggest no threat to the seafaring occupation for coming generation. The content of the occupation will of course change due to the phase of implementation of degree of digitalization, but there will always be a need for maritime knowledge and understanding.",

Having been relatively autonomous, Scottish Gaelic chiefs were now drawn deeper into the orbit of the Scottish and then British crown, particularly during the adult reign of James VI (and I) (1587\u20131625). Scholarly study of the Highlands and Islands during the period has tended to concentrate on crown-clan relationships and the way in which the centre imposed reform on the peripheral G\u00e0idhealtachd (Highlands and Islands). Indigenous (Highland/Hebridean) and maritime perspectives have been less well developed in these narratives. Gaelic Scots and visiting Lowland fishermen had different approaches to the exploitation of marine resources. The approaches of both parties, of Gaelic Scots, as well as Lowland fishermen and merchants, to the maritime environment are examined here: a study which can bring new insights into older debates on crown\u2014clan relations if not plantation, state formation, and colonial approaches to resource appropriation and exploitation.",

The primary sensor for maritime situation assessment is still the radar, with the AIS being introduced as supplemental service only. In this article, we present a framework to assess the current situation picture based on marine radar image processing. Essentially, the framework comprises a centralized IMM\u2013JPDA multi-target tracker in combination with a fully automated scheme for track management, i.e., target acquisition and track depletion. This tracker is conditioned on measurements extracted from radar images. To gain a more robust and complete situation picture, we are exploiting the aspect angle diversity of multiple marine radars, by fusing them a priori to the tracking process. Due to the generic structure of the proposed framework, different techniques for radar image processing can be implemented and compared, namely the BLOB detector and SExtractor. The overall framework performance in terms of multi-target state estimation will be compared for both methods based on a dedicated measurement campaign in the Baltic Sea with multiple static and mobile targets given.",

      "abstract": "There is a growing need for operational oceanographic predictions in both the Arctic and Antarctic polar regions. In the former, this is driven by a declining ice cover accompanied by an increase in maritime traffic and exploitation of marine resources. Oceanographic predictions in the Antarctic are also important, both to support Antarctic operations and also to help elucidate processes governing sea ice and ice shelf stability. However, a significant gap exists in the ocean observing system in polar regions, compared to most areas of the global ocean, hindering the reliability of ocean and sea ice forecasts. This gap can also be seen from the spread in ocean and sea ice reanalyses for polar regions which provide an estimate of their uncertainty. The reduced reliability of polar predictions may affect the quality of various applications including search and rescue, coupling with numerical weather and seasonal predictions, historical reconstructions (reanalysis), aquaculture and environmental management including environmental emergency response. Here, we outline the status of existing near-real time ocean observational efforts in polar regions, discuss gaps, and explore perspectives for the future. Specific recommendations include a renewed call for open access to data, especially real-time data, as a critical capability for improved sea ice and weather forecasting and other environmental prediction needs. Dedicated efforts are also needed to make use of additional observations made as part of the Year of Polar Prediction (YOPP; 2017-19) to inform optimal observing system design. To provide a polar extension to the Argo network, it is recommended that a network of ice-borne sea ice and upper-ocean observing buoys be deployed and supported operationally in ice-covered areas together with autonomous profiling floats and gliders (potentially with ice detection capability) in seasonally-ice covered seas. Finally, additional efforts to better measure and parameterize surface exchanges in polar regions are much needed to improve coupled environmental prediction.",

      "abstract": "In recent years, we have witnessed a substantial increase in the interest in maritime mining in the world, which has resulted in the development of many new methods for the exploitation of marine deposits as well as transport of spoil from the seabed to the surface (Karlic, 1984, Depowski, Kotli\u0144ski, R\u00fchle, Szamalek, 1998, Abramowski and Kotli\u0144ski, 2011, SPC, 2013, Royal Society, 2017, Sharma, 2017, Jones et al, 2019, Websites: JOGMEC, Nautilus Minerals, Atlantis II Deep, Bluenodules). In their research, the authors have been working on the development of a new concept of transport from the seabed.\n                     The authors have already presented the concept of the principle of operation of an autonomous transport module for transport from the seabed (Filipek and Broda, 2016, 2017, 2018). They designed and constructed a laboratory stand and carried out experiments, the results of which confirmed the applicability of the concept discussed in transport from the seabed. The research also included the determination of the energy source in the transport process and the changes in the average density of the transport module. Three transport concepts from the seabed were also compared in terms of their energy demand. In the next step, the authors addressed the issues of stability of the transport module in the process of immersion and ascent.\n                     In the course of these studies, there appeared the necessity of the theoretical examination of mass transfer between the transport module and the environment, which is the subject of this publication. The in-depth analysis of this issue is essential from the point of view of the practical suitability of the module for transporting from the seabed because the course of mass exchange between the transport module and the environment determines the speed of immersion and ascent.",

      "abstract": "The enabling Internet-of-Things (IoT) technology has inspired a large number of novel platforms and applications. One popular IoT platform is unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs, also known as drone). Benefiting from the intrinsic flexibility, convenience, and low cost, UAVs have great potentials to be utilized in various civil applications, including parcel delivery. However, suffering from limited payloads and battery capacities, it is uneconomical for UAVs to perform parcel delivery tasks independently. To conquer the drawbacks of low payloads and battery capacities, people propose to employ both trucks and drones to construct truck-drone parcel delivery systems. However, previous works only leverage either independent drones or truck-carried drones to collaborate with trucks. In contrast, in this article we propose to simultaneously employ trucks, truck-carried drones, and independent drones to construct a more efficient truck-drone parcel delivery system. We claim that such a hybrid parcel delivery system can fully exploit the complementary benefits of the three platforms. We propose a novel routing and scheduling algorithm, referred to as hybrid truck-drone delivery (HTDD) algorithm, to solve the hybrid parcel delivery problem, wherein M drones carried by M trucks, together with N independent drones, cooperate to deliver parcels to customers distributed in a wide region. The experimental results show that our algorithm outperforms the existing solutions which employ either independent drones or truck-carried drones.",

      "abstract": "The development of artificial intelligence technology shows the possibility of technologies such as autonomous vehicles and A.I robots. Correspondingly, there are many researches and developments for the machine learning. As the evolution of machine learning technology occurs, classification techniques such as image recognition are not as demanding as before. This recognition technique is also important in autonomous vehicle system. For that, we succeeded in training and classifying a few classes (man, car, truck, etc.) in the roadway driving situation using the darkflow which combined the YOLO framework and the tensorflow. In this way, collecting, learning, and recognizing simple objects is relatively easy, but the recognition system for a safe autonomous vehicle system must also be able to recognize certain situations. So we designed the system for training the specific driving conditions on the roadway such as `Car too close', `Under the construction', `People caution' etc. However, it is difficult to gather a lot of specific training data on machine learning. For example, simple forklifts or automobile images on the web can be easily obtained, but data on road construction situation or data on cars just before the crash will be hard to collect. In this paper, we propose a system that can generate a specific situation data using Generative Adversarial Network (GAN).",

      "abstract": "The unmanned underwater vehicle (UUV) plays an ever increasing and important role in the modern marine environment. In particular, the tasks of underwater reconnaissance and surveillance, underwater mine hunting and anti-submarine warfare, all poses a serious and dangerous threat to humans. UUV has become the fore-running technology to accomplish such missions. In this paper, a method based on dynamic Bayesian network modeling was proposed to evaluate the UUV in an underwater threat situation. We divided the UUV threats into three categories: environmental factors, platform factors, and mission factors. Through each of these categories, we carried out factor extraction and set up the priori probability according to the characteristics. Setting up the static Bayesian network involved the addition of state transition probability and establishment of the model for assessing the dynamic Bayesian threat situation. By comparing the results of the static and dynamic Bayesian simulation, it was shown that the dynamic Bayesian is superior. Moreover, by analyzing the sensitivity, we recognized the greatest current threat and in response, determined the appropriate UUV countermeasures. The results showed that the dynamic Bayesian method has great practical significance and value for threat assessment.",

      "abstract": "As piracy presents great threats to maritime security, unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) swarm monitoring is becoming an attractive countermeasure. Conventional sweep monitoring method provides balanced coverage but cannot adapt to variable situations, such as the return of UAVs for refueling. This paper proposes a pheromone-based method for UAV swarm anti-piracy monitoring. In this method, the environment is modeled by a pheromone map, and the motion of UAVs is guided by the strength of pheromones. A ship-centered convening mechanism is proposed to increase the chance of finding pirates by taking the interactions between pirates and merchant ships into account. A prediction-reservation mechanism is proposed to improve the deficiencies of the implicit intention propagation mechanism when the ship-centered convening mechanism is used. Simulation experiments are conducted to study the effectiveness of the proposed method. Results show that the proposed method reduces the success rate of pirate attack by 8% at most compared to the sweep method, and that the prediction-reservation mechanism performs better than the implicit intention propagation mechanism, especially with large number of UAVs.",

      "abstract": "Robotic structures that couple autonomous surface vehicles and unmanned underwater vehicles in integrated systems with various levels of cooperation provide interesting solutions to the problem of developing efficient, versatile and cost effective tools for exploration, monitoring and exploitation of the underwater environment. In this paper we describe the development and preliminary field testing of an autonomous surface vehichle that can automatically track, deploy and recover a small remotely operated vehicle, which is guided from a shore-ground station. This goal is achieved by exploiting two-ways transmission of data and commands through the umbilical and a wireless link with a shore-ground station. In this way, pilots can experiment telepresence in the underwater environment, avoiding the need of expensive and logistically demanding manned supply vessel. The vehicle is a small aluminum hull boat, equipped with a steering outboard electric motor. A multi-agent system in the ROS framework is proposed for the robotic structure. The use of commercial-off-the-shelf components and the choice of a multi-agent ROS architecture are a mean to reduce costs and to assure performances, modularity and versatility. Field tests in both supervised and autonomous guidance mode have been performed in order to assess the basic functionalities of the system and their results are illustrated and discussed.",

      "abstract": "Nowadays, oceans represent a very important part of our economies, as ways of communication between countries and because of the resources they contain, making their safety and protection major concerns that we all face. Because of this, there are several threats which must be dealt with. One of these threats are the Chemical, Biological, Radiological and Nuclear (CBRN) agents. In this framework, the development of technologies with the potential to increase the capabilities for detection of pollutants or toxic materials and situational awareness plays a significant role in the case of events in the scope of maritime accidents, pollution or port safety and security. These scenarios can pose substantial challenges to the operations, due to their complexity, and the use of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV) is increasingly becoming ubiquitous in this context. This paper is focused in operation environment demonstrations, which aimed to validate the operational feasibility of the concept simulating two different scenarios; chemical and radiological. The selected scenarios were chosen on a risk probability analysis, being very approximate to a real-life incident. This system was tested, and the validation tests are also represented. It proved to be an asset in CBRN releases, either intentional or non-intentional.",

The CCA is designed to enable the deployment of advanced autonomous underwater solutions making use of smart, adaptive and secure underwater networking strategies. The CCA and the implemented network modules have been extensively tested, validated and improved during various at-sea campaigns conducted in recent years, involving CMRE and partners. The collected results show that the CCA is a robust, reliable and effective solution supporting underwater communications and networking. It provides various functions and services for the development of novel cognitive and secure communication strategies, such as a cross-layer networking functionality and the ability to easily integrate various existing communications technologies. These aspects are key enablers in the construction of a system that is robust to challenging conditions, such as those posed by varying channel conditions or adversarial attacks.",

      "abstract": "With the rapid development of modern road traffic network, the demand of automatic traffic understanding has become a vital issue for building the intelligent traffic monitoring system and self-driving techniques. In this paper, we focus on behavior recognition of moving objects at busy road intersections in a modern city. To achieve this, we first capture a 4K (3840\u00d72160) traffic video at a busy road intersection of a modern megacity by flying an UAV during the rush hours, and then manually annotate locations and types of road vehicles to form a dataset for this research. Next we propose an innovative behavior recognition framework consists of advanced deep neural network based vehicle detection and localization, type (car, bus and truck) recognition, tracking and behavior recognition over time. We will present experimental results to demonstrate the effectiveness of our solution. This paper not only demonstrates the advantages of using the latest technological advancements (4K video and UAV) but also provides an advanced deep neural network based solution for exploiting these technological advancements for urban traffic analysis.",

      "abstract": "Oil spills pose a major threat of the oceanic and coastal environments, hence, an automatic detection and a continuous monitoring system comprises an appealing option for minimizing the response time of relevant operations. Numerous efforts have been conducted towards such solutions by exploiting a variety of sensing systems such as satellite Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) which can identify oil spills over sea surfaces in any environmental conditions and operational time. Such approaches include the use of artificial neural networks which effectively identify the polluted areas. Considering their remarkable abilities in many applications, deep Convolutional Neural Networks (DCNN) could surpass limitations and performances of previously proposed methods. This paper describes the application of an approach that combines the merits of a DCNN with SAR imagery in order to provide a fully automated oil spill identification system. The model semantically segments the input SAR images into multiple areas of interest. The deployed DCNN was trained using multiple SAR images acquired from the Sentinel-1 satellite provided by ESA and based on EMSA records for maritime pollution events. Experiments on such challenging benchmark datasets for such an abstract problem demonstrate that the algorithm can accurately identify oil spills leading to an effective detection solution.",

Apart from small boats entering into the territorial waters, Unmanned Aviation Vehicles over land and sea that are involved in EW assignments and also submarine periscopes are targets of interest. Such targets have weak reflected/scattered power, masked by strong correlated sea clutter and ground clutter returns. Extracting such weaker and unstable target returns requires efficient, reliable and robust Target detection methods and techniques. One of the detection methods viz Scan to Scan integration and their enhancement, exploiting the decorrelation properties of sea clutter over several antenna scans, will be analysed in this paper, with appropriate illustrations.",

      "abstract": "3D-beamforming capabilities of multiantenna equipments in fifth generation (5G) networks, operating in the millimeter wave (mmW) band, allow for accurate positioning and tracking of users. In this paper, we propose a method for 3D positioning and tracking of moving user equipments (UEs) in 5G mmW networks based on downlink (DL) reference signals (RSs) and maximum ratio combining of subcarriers. In particular, we consider a system in which base stations (BSs) transmit beamformed DL RSs in a periodic manner and UEs exploit such RSs for estimating the BS-UE beam-pair gains by coherently combining all of the available subcarriers. This is achieved by a novel maximum likelihood (ML) estimator for the beam-pair gain. These beam-pair gain estimates are then reported back to the BSs, where they are used to estimate the direction of departure (DoD) of the DL RSs by a novel extended Kalman filter (EKF). The obtained DoD estimates from all available BSs are fused into a UE position estimate in a central unit of the considered network by a second stage EKF. Hence, the computational burden is distributed among different network entities. The proposed positioning algorithm may be implemented with minor modifications to the signalling scheme currently specified for the first phase (Rel. 15) of 3GPP 5G New Radio (NR) system. The performance of this positioning scheme is evaluated in a realistic ray-tracing based outdoor scenario resembling an automated truck platooning in a cargo port setting,",

      "abstract": "Todays standard cars incorporate more and more assistance systems to make traveling by car safer and more comfortable, step by step bridging the gap to completely autonomous vehicles. Also in the area of commercial vehicles, the automation process makes progress improving for example the transportation efficiency. But most research focuses on on-road scenarios. While these scenes are highly structured and most environmental conditions can be foreseen, the perception, interpretation and forecast in unstructured off-road environments makes the safe and efficient automation of vehicles much more difficult. This paper presents an approach for supportive low-level control of vehicles in rough terrain exploiting the behavior-based control paradigm. Important safety features like collision avoidance are implemented using interacting behaviors with dynamic priorities adapting to the current environmental conditions and system state. The flexibility and effectiveness of the presented approach is shown in simulation and real world scenarios using different kinds of vehicles as a GatorX855D off-road vehicle, Unimog U5023 special truck, and BOMAG tandem rollers.",

      "abstract": "As a $183.3 Billion industry controlling 90% of all world trade, the shipping community is continuously looking for methods to increase profits while still considering human and environmental safety. As a result of developing technologies and policy that make autonomy a feasible solution, at least three separate organizations are aiming to produce and sail their first autonomous ships by 2020. Thus it is essential to begin assessing their cyber-risk profiles in order to rank and mitigate any vulnerabilities. As existing risk models for physical ship safety and autonomous cars do not adequately represent the unique nature of cyber-threats for autonomous vessels within the maritime sector, this article applies a model-based risk assessment framework named MaCRA which had previous only been used to model existing ships, not those of the near-future.",

To study the influence of submarine flow on hydrodynamic coefficients of AUV for the safety of recovery of AUV, the influence of submarine flow on hydrodynamic coefficients of AUV is analyzed by CFD method. The Reynolds Average N-S (RANS) equations are solved based on the Finite Volume Method (FVM), subsequently, the study is performed by using CFD method combined with the grid partition idea. The numerical results show that the influence of submarine flow on hydrodynamic coefficients of AUV will be affected by attack angles and sideslip angles of AUV, and the the effect of Reynolds numbers on the hydrodynamic coefficients of AUV can be ignored.",

      "abstract": "This paper presents an advanced urban traffic density estimation solution using the latest deep learning techniques to intelligently process ultrahigh-resolution traffic videos taken from an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV). We first capture nearly an hour-long ultrahigh-resolution traffic video at five busy road intersections of a modern megacity by flying a UAV during the rush hours. We then randomly sampled over 17 K 512\u00d7512 pixel image patches from the video frames and manually annotated over 64 K vehicles to form a dataset for this paper, which will also be made available to the research community for research purposes. Our innovative urban traffics analysis solution consists of an advanced deep neural network (DNN) based vehicle detection and localization, type (car, bus, and truck) recognition, tracking, and vehicle counting over time. We will present extensive experimental results to demonstrate the effectiveness of our solution. We will show that our enhanced single shot multibox detector (Enhanced-SSD) outperforms other DNN-based techniques and that deep learning techniques are more effective than traditional computer vision techniques in traffic video analysis. We will also show that ultrahigh-resolution video provides more information that enables more accurate vehicle detection and recognition than lower resolution contents. This paper not only demonstrates the advantages of using the latest technological advancements (ultrahigh-resolution video and UAV), but also provides an advanced DNN-based solution for exploiting these technological advancements for urban traffic density estimation.",

      "abstract": "GNSS are well known to be accurate providers of position information across the globe. Because of high signal availabilities, robust receivers, and well-populated constellations, operators typically believe that the location information provided by their GNSS receiver is correct. More sophisticated users are concerned with the integrity of the derived location information; for example, employ RAIM algorithms to address possible satellite failure modes.\n\nThe most common attacks on GNSS availability and integrity are known as jamming and spoofing. Jamming involves the transmission of signals that interfere with GNSS reception so that the receiver is unable to provide a position or time solution. Various methods to detect jamming, and possibly overcome it, have been considered in the literature. Spoofing is the transmission of counterfeit GNSS signals so as to mislead a GNSS receiver into reporting an inaccurate position or time. If undetected, spoofing might be much more dangerous than a jamming attack. A typical maritime concern is a spoofer convincing a tanker traveling up a channel to a harbor that it is off track of the channel.\n\nA variety of approaches have been proposed in the literature to recognize spoofing; many of these are based on the RF signal alone as, in some sense, they are the simplest to implement. Of interest here are methods which compare GNSS information to measurements available from other, non-GNSS sensors. Examined examples include IMUs, radars, and ranges/pseudoranges from non-GNSS signals. In all cases the data from these others sensors is compared to the position information from the GNSS receiver to assess its integrity. \n\nTriangulation of position from bearing measurements is a well-known localization technique, especially for the mariner. This paper considers the use of bearing information to detect GNSS spoofing in a 2-D environment. A typical marine application is a ship entering a harbor and using an alidade to sight landmarks; for mobile, autonomous vehicles the sensor might be a camera taking a bearing to a nearby vehicle or to a signpost. This paper presents a mathematical formulation of the problem and the sensor data, develops a statistical model of the measurements relative to the GNSS position output, constructs a generalized likelihood ratio test detection algorithm based on the Neyman-Pearson performance criterion (maximizing probability of detection while bounding the probability of false alarm), and examines performance of the test, both through analysis and experimentation. A comparison to using both range and bearing is included to show the utility and limitations of bearing data to spoof detection.",

      "abstract": "Navigation of Autonomous Underwater Vehicles (AUVs) remains a challenge due to the impossibility to use radio frequency signals and Global Positioning System (GPS). Navigation systems usually integrate different proprioceptive sensors to estimate the asset and the speed of the vehicle. In particular, the Doppler Velocity Log (DVL) is fundamental during the navigation to have an accurate estimate of the vehicle&rsquo;s speed. This work addresses the enhancement of the navigation performance of an AUV through the development of a Deep Water Navigation Filter (DWNF). The DWNF is able to work in those scenarios where traditional navigation sensors show their limits: e.g., deep waters where DVL bottom lock cannot be achieved, or areas where the use of traditionally used static and dedicated beacons is incompatible with the mission requirements. The proposed approach exploits the concept of using a network of vehicles cooperatively supporting each other for their navigation. Several types of measurements coming from the different nodes (i.e. acoustic positioning system such as ship-mounted SSBL acoustic positioning system, USBL, range measurements from the different nodes) are fused in an Extended Kalman Filter framework with the odometry data. DWNF pushes forward the idea of using a network of robotic assets as a provider of navigation services allowing more flexible and robust operations of the deployed system.\n\nThe approach has been tested at sea during several experiments. We report here results from DWNF running successfully in real-time on the NATO STO-Centre for Maritime Research and Experimentation (CMRE) vehicles during the Dynamic Mongoose&rsquo;17 experimentation off the South coast of Iceland (June-July 2017).&nbsp;\nTesei, A; Micheli, M; Vermeij, A; Ferri, G; Mazzi, M; Grenon, G; Morlando, L; Costanzi, R; Fenucci, D; Caiti, A; Munaf\u00f2, A",

      "abstract": "Internet of Things technology has been widely used in water traffic research. Many critical waterways in the world are becoming more crowded due to many factors in waterway environments, such as invisibility, variability, and uncertainty. Accurate water depth information is necessary to improve navigation safety. Water depth information of electronic charts cannot be updated in a timely way, while the actual water depth is unpredictable, and this factor threatens the safety of vessels in waterway environments. Based on the shore-based network, ship navigation data and other big data can be integrated to vessels navigation environments in real time. In this paper, we present a new scheme to quickly and accurately construct a vessel safety navigation depth reference map, which contains appropriate channel water depth information. This effective scheme is based on automated identification system (AIS) data and increases the travel safety through crowded waterways. AIS data include rich maritime traffic information. Both the static and the dynamic information about vessels through waterways can be extracted and processed from big real-time AIS data. Based on extensive actual experiments, we apply data mining techniques to extract the waterway depth information both draft-depth and vessel trajectories based on AIS data. The data are collected from vessels in both locations: 1) the Nantong port, in Jiangsu Province, China and 2) Meizhou Bay waterway, in Fujian Province, China. The Hermite interpolation scheme is used to patch the trajectories of vessels, and the BP neural network model is introduced to predict the maximum vessel draft. Clustering and data fusion methods are employed to construct a vessel safety navigation depth reference map according to the cluster area of vessel trajectories and draft information. The experimental results demonstrate that the vessel safety navigation depth reference map accurately reflects the current water depth profile of channels. This paper can provide accurate and timely channel water-depth information for the vessel navigation and the maritime supervision. The proposed scheme in this paper can also provide reference for trajectory data processing and mining.",

      "abstract": "The possibility of increasing flight duration, particularly for small and micro fixed-wing Unmanned Aerial Systems (UAS), is typically hindered by the payload and size of the platform. In maritime missions, Atmospheric Energy Harvesting (AEH) near the Marine Atmospheric Boundary Layer (MABL), is a low-cost solution, with very promising results, that may allow drastic increases in flight duration by exploiting wind energy. The utilization of atmospheric energy is not a straightforward process. Understanding the mechanics behind the dynamic soaring process, which is the most promising form of AEH in marine applications, is key. A proper identification and characterization of the wind field is required. In addition, a smart trajectory generation and tracking module shall maximize the energy gain or to increase the flying time. The atmospheric energy represents a series of complex processes, specially when it comes to the interaction between the ocean and the atmosphere in the MABL. However, the MABL has drastic gradient changes in which soaring maneuvers can be performed. This paper focuses in the study of the soaring energy transfer mechanisms, based on the the interaction between the MABL and the surface of the ocean and on observations of birds that perform swooping maneuvers. This allows the generation of energy efficient trajectories that will provide a UAS with extended time duration in an oceanic mission. The trajectory generation method considers interpolating splines that contain wind information embedded into the control points, i.e. tension, velocity and direction unitary vector, aiming to replicate the biologically-inspired Rayleigh cycle. Preliminary results in simulations are presented, showing that there are potential energy gains after executing splines that follow basic Rayleigh cycles.",

      "abstract": "Unmanned or manned underwater vehicles are often designed in cylindrical shapes which have desirable properties for withstanding the pressures that can be experienced in undersea environments. However, cylindrical designs are not required for non-pressurized enclosures. Non-cylindrical designs may provide benefits to developers including allowing a wider variety of materials for construction, greater separation between instruments or equipment, and a greater separation between the center of gravity and the center of buoyancy, which will enhance stability. The work described here proposes a bio-inspired design where novel materials are used in construction and the benefits of a non-cylindrical shape are exploited. This novel design was used to produce a human-powered submersible (Trigonus) for the 14th International Submarine Races (ISR). The design was inspired by the boxfishes (Teleostei: Ostraciidae), which have been studied extensively for their hydrodynamic properties. This family of fishes have been reported to have low-drag coefficients and enhanced stability [1 but see 2] and have inspired the design of the Mercedes-Benz Bionic concept car [3]. Additionally, the fish have relatively flat sides, which can be replicated without complicated fabrication or materials, enabling simple production with inexpensive materials. The specific species used for the design described here is the Buffalo trunkfish (Lactophrys trigonus) which has a triangular cross-section with two ventral keels and one dorsal keel. Trigonus is a human powered submersible that consists of a central frame for a modular component system with a separate hull designed to provide relatively low-drag and improved stability. The hull surrounds the frame and is attached at the ends. The hull is constructed using a novel technique where pieces of corrugated plastic are stitched together to form a triangular monocoque hull. The triangular shape of the hull mimics Lactophrys trigonus in attempt to exploit the fish's low-drag high-stability hydrodynamic properties. The monocoque constructions provides the necessary stiffness to resist deformation when underway. Preliminary testing was conducted to evaluate the performance of the submersible. Additionally, the submersible participated in 14th ISR in June of 2017. Results from preliminary testing and relative performance compared with traditional cylindrical designs are discussed.",

      "abstract": "<p><strong class=\"journal-contentHeaderColor\">Abstract.</strong> The demand for 3D maps of cities and road networks is steadily growing and mobile laser scanning (MLS) systems are often the preferred geo-data acquisition method for capturing such scenes. Because MLS systems are mounted on cars or vans they can acquire billions of points of road scenes within a few hours of survey. Manual processing of point clouds is labour intensive and thus time consuming and expensive. Hence, the need for rapid and automated methods for 3D mapping of dense point clouds is growing exponentially. The last five years the research on automated 3D mapping of MLS data has tremendously intensified. In this paper, we present our work on automated classification of MLS point clouds. In the present stage of the research we exploited three features &ndash; two height components and one reflectance value, and achieved an overall accuracy of 73&thinsp;%, which is really encouraging for further refining our approach.</p>",

      "abstract": "Ultra-Short BaseLine (USBL) positioning systems born as a technology for underwater target tracking from a vessel. Despite they are commonly and efficiently used for this purpose, the recent literature about navigation of Autonomous Underwater Vehicles (AUVs) demonstrates that they can represent a valuable support for these systems. Measurements of the AUV position can be exploited as observations within the onboard navigation filter to limit the drift of the state estimation error, unavoidable drawback in case of dead reckoning based approaches. This way, the AUVs can indeed be involved in longterm missions without the necessity of periodic surfacing to get GPS signal for estimation error reset. The paper presents some deductions derived by a considerable set of acoustic position measurements obtained through an EvoLogics S2CR 18/34 USBL modem used in two different configurations (fixed to a tripod on the bottom and floating on the surface). Different results were obtained in the two cases. The proposed analysis of the results will be a solid base for the optimization of the configuration of an USBL-aided navigation system for AUVs that the authors plan to implement and test in the coming future. Part of the experimental data are obtained exploiting the Littoral Ocean Observatory Network (LOON). The LOON consists of four EvoLogics S2CR 18/34 modems deployed by the NATO Science and Technology Organization Centre for Maritime Research and Experimentation (STO-CMRE) in the sea in front of La Spezia, Italy.",

      "abstract": "One important aspect that needs to be carefully considered in maritime operations using unmanned robotic vehicles is the communication restrictions between the vehicles and the mission controller that arises mainly due to long distances and/or low power transmissions. This paper addresses the problem of maintaining a communication link between a command station and an Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) with limited communication range during maritime operations. The proposed scheme uses an additional UAV that acts as a relay for the communication between the command station and the UAV in mission and is actively driven to maintain a desired Quality-of-Service (QoS) level, defined in this paper. Exploiting this architecture, it is possible to plan a maritime operation for a robotic vehicle without the need of considering vehicle-to-command-station communication constraints that will be satisfied by the introduction of the extra autonomous relay-UAVs. To this end, we propose a feedback strategy that has the dual task of commanding and optimizing the execution of the relay UAV motion tasks and adapting the scheduler algorithm according to a desired QoS level. The performance of the proposed strategy is illustrated through computer simulations and preliminary experimental results.",

      "abstract": "Maritime Situational Awareness is crucial in maritime operations to identify threats and to deal with them as soon as possible. These threats can be pirates in shipping operations, icebergs when sailing in the northern sea routes, or even unknown vessels or objects that might be on the ship's path. A solution to identify these threats is the use of UAV's to overfly the ship's planned path. This solution is described in this paper, using an autonomous fixed wing UAV. Based on the provided ship's planned path, the UAV should autonomously map the area close to the ship track. To do that, an optimization problem is solved using Model Predictive Control, where the turn rate for the next time period is optimized. Based on the turn rate, the future path of the UAV is calculated and the waypoints are sent to the autopilot. This application is thoroughly tested using a Software In Loop environment, where an aircraft model is used with the autopilot's simulation. The results show that surveillance performance is improved if the UAV has information about the ship's velocity in addition to position.",

      "abstract": "In order to further expand the sustainability of maritime operations the use of autonomous vehicles has been employed at an increasing scale. This natural increase comes not only in the form of the multiplication of the numbers of the same vehicle model, but also in diversifying the vehicle composition setup in order to allow the exploitation of different types of payloads. Moreover, this use of heterogeneous multi-vehicle teams allows overcoming individual limitations that one specific vehicle model might have. Nevertheless, this increase in scale and functionality also causes an increase in control, management, and spatial and operational complexity. This complexity is addressed in the framework of the LSTS Neptus-IMC-Dune software toolchain. The software toolchain is a framework for mixed-initiative control (humans in the planning and control loops) of unmanned ocean and air vehicles operating in communications challenged environments with support for Disruptive Tolerant Networking (DTN) protocols. The use of such a toolchain has allowed for repeated and successful deployments of heterogeneous multi-vehicle teams. The paper reports these deployments together with an in-depth description of the toolchain.",

      "abstract": "This paper addresses safety indicators for truck platooning at short inter-vehicle distances (with a time gap of 0.5 s). The aim of a safety indicator is to determine the correct moment for initiating a Collision Avoidance brake action to prevent a collision with the preceding truck in threatening situations. Three safety indicators are selected for an evaluation: the intended acceleration of the preceding truck, which is shared via Vehicle-to-Vehicle (V2V) communication, the Brake Threat Number (BTN - based on simple vehicle models and an emergency brake assumption of the lead), and the Time-To-Collision (TTC - based on a constant velocity assumption). The latter two do not rely on V2V communication, but are obtained via on-board signals. Requirements for the amount of false negatives (missing a threatening situation) and the false positives (identifying a safe situation as threatening) are derived from a functional safety perspective. To find thresholds for the safety indicators that minimize the false negative rate, emergency brake tests are used. To evaluate the number of false positives, a set of data of two trucks driving in a platoon at 0.5 s at mixed-traffic highways in Belgium and the Netherlands, collected during 8 hours of automated driving in a platoon, is used. The results indicate that the communicated intended acceleration of the preceding truck might be able to distinguish safe and threatening situations in a vehicle platoon. Furthermore, for situations without V2V, both the BTN and the TTC are not capable to distinguish between threatening and safe situations. The amount of false positives found in the safe driving data-set does not fulfill the requirements derived from functional safety perspective.",

In order to select an appropriate thruster that will achieve the required speed of the ARV, the ANSYS-CFX tools are used to predicted the drag force.

      "abstract": "Marine robots and unmanned surface vehicles will increasingly be deployed in rivers and riverine environments. The structure produced by flowing waters may be exploited for purposes of estimation, planning, and control. This paper adopts a widely acknowledged model for the geometry of watercourse channels, namely sine-generated curves, as a basis for estimators that predict the shape of the yet unseen portion of the river. Predictions of this sort help a robot anticipate the future, for example, in throttling speeds as it rounds a bend. After examining how to reparameterize standard filters to incorporate this model, we compare the performance of three Gaussian filters and show that nonideality and theoretical challenges (of non-linearity, multi-modality/periodicity) degrade the performance of standard Kalman filters severely, but can be successfully mitigated by imposing an interval constraint. Thereafter, we present results of a constrained interval Kalman filter on data from three natural rivers. The results we report show the effectiveness of our method on the estimation of meander parameters. The results we report, including data from simulation, from maps, and from GPS tracks of a boat on the Colorado river, show the effectiveness of our method on the estimation of meander parameters.",

      "abstract": "Laser technology has observed a great advancement over the last few decades. This technology is used for a wide range of applications including medical sciences, military, industrial manufacturing, electronics, holography, spectroscopy, astronomy and much more. Military operations often demand a secure and timely transmission of a massive amount of information from one place to another. Until now, the military has relied on the radio spectrum for effective communication, which is vulnerable to security threats and susceptible to electromagnetic interference (EMI). Also, this spectrum is hard-pressed to meet the current bandwidth requirement for high-resolution images, on-air video conferencing and real-time data transfer. Therefore, the focus has shifted to visible and infrared spectrum using laser technology which is capable of providing secure data transfer because of its immunity to EMI. The probability of intercepting a laser signal is very low due to its narrow beam divergence and coherent optical beam, making the laser a suitable candidate for secure military tactical operations. Besides the communication aspect, the highly directive nature of a laser beam is also used as a directed energy laser weapon. These highly powerful and light weighted directed energy laser weapons are very cost-effective countermeasures for airborne threats. Furthermore, laser sensors are deployed in the battlefield or in space for tracking the path of a wide range of military vehicles like missiles, unmanned aerial vehicles, fighter aircraft, warships, submarines, and so on. Advancements in space operations and laser technology have offered synergistic possibilities of using lasers from space-based platforms during military operations. In this paper, we are providing our readers with a comprehensive study of laser applications, used by the military, to carry out tactical operations on the ground or space-based platforms. Also, an intensive investigation on the development of laser technology for sensors, range-finders and target designators that are used for intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance is presented in the paper. The advancement of laser communication for military purposes and its current state of the art is reviewed as well as some recent scientific developments in the area of high-energy directed laser weapons are discussed, which have revolutionized military battlefields. Therefore, this manuscript highlights recent trends and engineering breakthroughs for the use of lasers in tactical operations.",

      "abstract": "To date, it is impossible to imagine your life without all kinds of gadgets, the Internet and social networks. The active using of social networks has long been carried out by all state bodies in order to cause confidence of the population to their actions, to see feedback in the format of comments, as well as to show people all topical processes. It is also important to note that Ukraine is an advanced state in the field of electronic document circulation, and therefore almost all processes, starting from the activities of banking institutions and ending with the activity of air and railway transport are carried out by automated electronic systems. Accordingly, the coordinated and uninterrupted functioning of all of the above is due to the stability of cyberspace. In connection with Russia\u2019s attack the information space became the second battlefield. Cyberattacks and official state sites hacking was immediately started, there were active attempts to abduct electronic data of banking institutions and private enterprises. The relevance of this article is determined by it, because a detailed analysis of the characteristic features of cybercrime, the search for methods and mechanisms of countering cybercrime in the conditions of war are the primary tasks and contribution to victory. The purpose of the article is to analyze the current state of countering cybercrime and varieties of cybercrime, to identify features and characteristics of cybercrime, as well as to make proposals for improving the current legislation in this area. The study used the following methods: analysis and synthesis, legal, static, systemic and formal-legal methods, method of interpretation of law. The conclusions, which we will make, can be a basis for further improvement of legislation, research and discussions between theorists and practitioners.",

      "abstract": "Regardless of how many classes a machine learning model had seen during the training procedure, it is inevitable that unexpected and unknown objects will appear during the testing procedure. Therefore, anomaly segmentation has become an important topic in machine learning, especially for life-critical machine learning applications such as self-driving cars. Recently, Prototypical Anomaly Segmentation (PAnS) was proposed for road anomaly segmentation through prototype learning. In the training procedure, the model extracts the class-prototypes by learning the pixel features of various objects in the image. In the testing procedure, the model identifies which pixels in the image belong to the unknown objects by comparing the features of test images with the class-prototypes. In the field of road anomaly segmentation, this model has achieved the state-of-the-art accuracy in the past. However, when using PAnS to perform anomaly segmentation on road scene images, some blocks of unknown objects in the images cannot be correctly identified as anomalies. When the model is used in self-driving car, it could wrongly classify the objects as part of the road and lead the self-driving car to crash. To solve the above problem, this paper proposes a deep neural network model named Adversarial Perturbation - Prototypical Anomaly Segmentation (AP-PAnS). We enhance the accuracy of prototype learning in road anomaly segmentation by adding adversarial perturbations to the data. In the testing procedure, the perturbation can have stronger effect on the unknown objects than that on known objects. Thus, the model can more accurately distinguish pixels from the known objects and the unknown objects in the images. Experiments on StreetHazards show that. AP-PAnS consistently outperforms the state-of-the-art model by a large margin. Our approach improves AUPR by 118%, AUROC by 4%, and reduces FPR95 by 34%, establishing a new state-of-the-art accuracy on road anomaly segmentation.",

      "abstract": "Infectious diseases pose a serious threat to global health. Although immunizations can control most viral infections, bacterial infections, particularly those caused by drug-resistant strains, continue to cause high rates of illness and death. Unfortunately, the creation of new antibiotics has come to a grinding halt in the last ten years. In response to this crisis, nanotechnology has emerged as a hopeful solution to tackle drug resistance and enhance treatment results. A large variety of biomimetic nanomaterials, termed nanozymes, have demonstrated strong antimicrobial efficacy. While the inherent toxicity of nanomaterials is a concern, recent studies have harnessed the stimuli-responsiveness of nanomaterials to enable local and/or targeted delivery to reduce the treatment side effects. Indeed, the physicochemical versatility of nanomaterials affords many degrees of freedom that enable rational design of smart or autonomous therapeutics, which cannot be achieved using conventional antibiotics. The design straddles the fields of catalysis, nanoscience, microbiology, and translational medicine. To provide an overview of this interdisciplinary landscape, this review is organized based on composition into lipid, metal, metal oxide, and non-metallic nanomaterials. Liposomes as a delivery vehicle enhance bioavailability and reduce toxicity. Metal- and metal oxide-based nanomaterials inhibit bacterial growth by mimicking natural enzymatic activities such as peroxidase (POD) and oxidase. Furthermore, carbon-, polymer-, and cell membrane-based nanomaterials are combined into a discussion on non-metallic materials. At the end of this review, potentially fruitful directions for future bioinspired nanomaterials in infectious disease treatment are included.",

      "abstract": "The structural analysis of cultural heritage buildings, including their monitoring and maintenance, requires accurate 3D models of the structure, especially when these monuments are threatened (e.g., anthropogenic and natural disturbances).  However, monuments such as castles and monasteries often lack such construction plans. Structure from motion (SfM) photogrammetry and Terrestrial Laser Scanning (TLS) techniques can provide a geometrically accurate and cost-efficient survey solution to derive such plans. The accuracy and spatial resolution of the derived 3D reconstructions depend on instrumentation and data processing procedures. Here, remote sensing data, acquired from Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAV) and TLS surveys, were combined to map and monitor an eighteenth-century monastery. The monastery, located close to the village of Skoutera in Western Greece, is within the area of an active landslide that has already impacted different building elements. Significant cracks have appeared on the ground floor and the walls of the building putting its structural integrity in question. A DJI Phantom four Pro UAV together with photogrammetry were used for the aerial surveys. Ground observations with a Leica P50 TLS were used to map the interior and the exterior of the monastery. The derived 3D point clouds from the TLS scans obtained at different time periods were processed with change detection methods for the precise mapping of the ongoing displacements in building\u2019s elements and quantitative mapping of the cracks.  Moreover, a Building Information Modeling (BIM) approach was used to generate a structural plan of the monastery that could facilitate the monitoring process and possible maintenance interventions in the future.

      "abstract": "Deploying socially assistive robots (SARs) at home, such as robotic companion pets, can be useful for tracking behavioral and health-related changes in humans during lifestyle fluctuations over time, like those experienced during CoVID-19. However, a fundamental problem required when deploying autonomous agents such as SARs in people\u2019s everyday living spaces is understanding how users interact with those robots when not observed by researchers. One way to address that is to utilize novel modeling methods based on the robot\u2019s sensor data, combined with newer types of interaction evaluation such as ecological momentary assessment (EMA), to recognize behavior modalities. This paper presents such a study of human-specific behavior classification based on data collected through EMA and sensors attached onboard a SAR, which was deployed in user homes. Classification was conducted using generative replay models, which attempt to use encoding/decoding methods to emulate how human dreaming is thought to create perturbations of the same experience in order to learn more efficiently from less data. Both multi-class and binary classification were explored for comparison, using several types of generative replay (variational autoencoders, generative adversarial networks, semi-supervised GANs). The highest-performing binary model showed approximately 79% accuracy (AUC 0.83), though multi-class classification across all modalities only attained 33% accuracy (AUC 0.62, F1 0.25), despite various attempts to improve it. The paper here highlights the strengths and weaknesses of using generative replay for modeling during human\u2013robot interaction in the real world and also suggests a number of research paths for future improvement.",

      "abstract": "Background: Infectious keratitis (IK) is a sight-threatening condition requiring immediate definite treatment. The need for prompt treatment heavily depends on timely diagnosis. The diagnosis of IK, however, is challenged by the drawbacks of the current \u2018gold standard\u2019. The poorly differentiated clinical features, the possibility of low microbial culture yield, and the duration for culture are the culprits of delayed IK treatment. Deep learning (DL) is a recent artificial intelligence (AI) advancement that has been demonstrated to be highly promising in making automated diagnosis in IK with high accuracy. However, its exact accuracy is not yet elucidated.This article is the first systematic review and meta-analysis that aims to assess the accuracy of available AI DL models to correctly classify IK based on etiology compared to the current gold standards. Methods: A systematic search was carried out in PubMed, Google Scholars, Proquest, ScienceDirect, Cochrane and Scopus. The used keywords are: \u201cKeratitis\u201d, \u201cCorneal ulcer\u201d, \u201cCorneal diseases\u201d, \u201cCorneal lesions\u201d, \u201cArtificial intelligence\u201d, \u201cDeep learning\u201d, and \u201cMachine learning\u201d. Studies including slit lamp photography of the cornea and validity study on DL performance were considered. The primary outcomes reviewed were the accuracy and classification capability of the AI machine learning/DL algorithm. We analyzed the extracted data with the MetaXL 5.2 Software. Results: A total of eleven articles from 2002 to 2022 were included with a total dataset of 34,070. All studies used convolutional neural networks (CNNs), with ResNet and DenseNet models being the most used models across studies. Most AI models outperform the human counterparts with a pooled area under the curve (AUC) of 0.851 and accuracy of 96.6% in differentiating IK vs. non-IK and pooled AUC 0.895 and accuracy of 64.38% for classifying bacterial keratitis (BK) vs. fungal keratitis (FK). Conclusion: This study demonstrated that DL algorithms have high potential in diagnosing and classifying IK with accuracy that, if not better, is comparable to trained corneal experts. However, various factors, such as the unique architecture of DL model, the problem with overfitting, image quality of the datasets, and the complex nature of IK itself, still hamper the universal applicability of DL in daily clinical practice.

      "abstract": "Threat detection in a Cyber-Physical System (CPS) platform is a key feature of ensuring the reliability and security of these connected methods, but digital elements interface with the physical world. CPS platforms are popular in sectors like healthcare, industrial automation, smart cities, and transportation making them vulnerable to different cyber-attacks. Threat detection in CPS contains the detection and mitigation of cybersecurity risks, which disrupt physical processes, compromise data integrity, and potentially cause safety concerns. Machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL) systems are exploited for detecting anomalies by learning the normal behaviour forms of the CPS and recognizing deviations. This study presents an Automated Threat Detection using the Flamingo Search Algorithm with Optimal Deep Learning (ATD-FSAODL) technique in a CPS environment. Initially, the ATD-FSAODL technique applies FSA-based feature subset selection to elect the better group of features. In addition, the ATD-FSAODL technique makes use of a modified Elman Spike Neural Network (MESNN) model for threat recognition and classification. Finally, the slime mold algorithm (SMA) is used for the optimal selection of the parameters related to the MESNN approach to ensure that the threat detection rate is improved. To estimate the solution of the ATD-FSAODL technique, a sequence of simulations can be carried out on benchmark databases. The performance values portray the capable solution of the ATD-FSAODL methodology with other methods with a maximum accuracy of 99.58%, precision of 99.58%, recall of 99.58%, F-score of 99.58%, and MCC of 99.16%. \u00c2\u00a9 ; 2023 The Authors.",

      "abstract": "There is a significant surge in unmanned aerial vehicles\u2019 (UAVs) popularity with an ongoing increase in demand due to their multi-functional uses. The capacity of the UAVs to respond to society and industry needs account for their pervasiveness. UAVs can be strategically deployed to enhance network efficiency and support critical missions, including vital tasks like infrastructure monitoring operations. To be effective, a UAV must interact securely with its network\u2019s entities, such as ground control stations, other UAVs, air traffic control systems, and navigation satellite systems. UAVs are exposed to a dangerous and costly world of cyber dangers as a result of cyber technology and connections. The UAV and the Ground Control Station (GCS) exchange information using communication lines, which are vulnerable to cyber-attacks. As a result, detective, defensive, and preventative countermeasures are critical. The Micro Air Vehicle Link (MAVLink) protocol is a widely used lightweight communication protocol for enabling communication between UAVs and GCSs. It outlines communication exchanges between a GCS and a UAV. It carries information about the UAV\u2019s condition as well as commands for control from the GCS. Although widely used, the MAVLink protocol lacks sufficient security measures and is susceptible to various types of attacks, which can pose significant risks to public safety. UAV data should be encrypted because they are very sensitive. To give a high level of security, complex operation encryption techniques are developed. These mathematical operations bring forth issues with efficiency and power usage, though. One of these methods, the ChaCha cipher, recently gained popularity after Google used it in several applications. In the current study, a new stream cipher method with low-duty cycles is proposed for protecting data in UAVs and is compared with existing security algorithms on the basis of various factors. The research findings show that by including the suggested method in MAVLink, it is possible to maintain both message secrecy and battery life for a resource-constrained UAV. This can be done while using comparable amounts of memory and CPU and without affecting MAVLink\u2019s performance.",

To deal with the hybrid threats at the cyber and physical layers, an estimator-based fault-tolerant hierarchical control scheme is introduced, which is applicable to channel-wise asynchronous communication. Sufficient conditions for formation tracking of maneuvering leader with ultimately bounded error are obtained, and the particular case of periodic communication and attacks with constrained duration and frequency is further analyzed. Comparative physical simulations based on ROS and Gazebo are first conducted to show the resilience of our scheme against the threats. Finally, an experimental platform containing DJI Tello quadrotors and a self-developed ground control station is built, based on which practical experiments with four quadrotors are carried out to evaluate the effectiveness and engineering practicability of the proposed control framework. \u00c2\u00a9 2023 ISA",

      "abstract": "The security and reliability of cellular-based wireless IoT networks are often hindered by eavesdropping attacks. Existing approaches have limitations such as ineffective relay selection, untrusted relay nodes, and improper UAV positioning. This article discusses secure and reliable communication in blockchain-enabled cellular-based IoT networks. In this article, we propose a novel approach that ensures the initial level of security to the UAV relays by enrolling the UAV relay nodes to the edge-assisted base stations for initial security and enhances the optimal UAV relay selection using dual-phase optimal relay selection mechanisms. This article performs authentication of UAV relay nodes to enhance security against active eavesdroppers and mitigates the effects of passive eavesdroppers by jointly optimizing power and position based on their actions. This enables eavesdropping to resist secure communication. The proposed approach beats the state-of-the-art algorithm in terms of decreased deployment time and gradually rising efficiency with increasing UEs. The deployment time for the previously presented algorithm is fast expanding, while the proposed integrated deployment algorithm is progressively increasing. The proposed eavesdropping resisted integration technique harvests an overlay complexity tendency due to its hybrid solution, enhancing system stability and minimizing system complexity. We further integrate the blockchain with UAVs in the system and perform authentication and appropriate relay selection in the networks. We will also demonstrate secure and reliable communication in healthcare, transportation, and industry. This paper emphasizes the significance of safe and dependable IoT connectivity and how blockchain technology and appropriate relay selection techniques might be helpful. The results show that the recommended algorithm is superior in terms of both reliability and complexity. When iteration count is minimal, the proposed method and the completely distributed have a comparable but lowest complexity as they outperform one another in different scenarios. Our proposed approach provides a possible solution to existing issues and contributes to the progress of secure and reliable communication in cellular-based wireless IoT networks. \u00c2\u00a9 2013 IEEE.",

      "abstract": "Multiagent deep reinforcement learning (MADRL)-based methods have been widely used to control the flight of multiple UAVs in high dynamic mobile crowdsensing (MCS). The existing MADRL-based methods assume that the state used for decision-making, such as GPS position, is accurate. However, the integrity of state is fragility to the GPS attacks. We formulate this vulnerability as the Physical-Sensing Inconsistency (PSI). Different from the existing methods that use additional hardware and software to judge the authenticity of GPS signals, we use the technology of robust deep reinforcement learning to overcome the impact of GPS attacks on UAV flight. Specifically, based on the existing MADRL algorithm, i.e., Multi-Agent Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient (MADDPG), we add a regularizer to its policy updating to mitigate the impact of the PSI. Finally, we use theoretical analysis and experiments to verify the security and effectiveness of the proposed method. \u00c2\u00a9 2023 IEEE.",

      "abstract": "As technology becomes more intertwined with our daily lives, it is increasingly important to protect our data from attackers. Cyber security has become a top priority for individuals, businesses, and governments, as the threat of cybercrime is constantly evolving and becoming more sophisticated. With the rapid increase in cyberattacks, it has become tricky and cumbersome for cybersecurity experts to react to them all, predict new attacks and analyze the impact of damage being done to business. Traditional security measures such as firewalls, anti-virus software, and intrusion detections are no longer adequate in protecting against new vulnerabilities, especially insider and misbehavior attacks. Recently, Artificial Intelligence based techniques have brought tremendous improvements in cybersecurity with the integration of machine learning (ML) algorithms. ML methods have been built upon large volumes of real-time network data to deploy automated security and threat detection systems. Nonetheless, various cyber-attacks still circumvent traditional security mechanisms deployed to detect those attacks. To address the challenge, in this paper, we propose a machine learning-enabled trust-based routing protocol (TrustML-RP) that identifies the attacking nodes responsible for Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) and packet suppression attacks. The proposed TrustML-RP scheme first adopts a distributed trust model for establishing trust factor among the participating nodes and later employs an effective combination of ML algorithms e.g., Artificial Neural Network (ANN) and Support Vector Machine (SVM) to find an optimal and secure route and identify attacker nodes. A comprehensive performance evaluation of the proposed scheme is carried out to demonstrate the efficiency on a reasonably sized network containing mixed nodes. The results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed scheme in building a trusted network environment and improving network security. The research findings suggest that the integration of a trust-based model and ML techniques can improve traditional cybersecurity methods thereby enabling cybersecurity professionals to design more effective cybersecurity systems.",

      "abstract": "Multispectral image pairs can provide independent and complementary information to more comprehensively describe detection targets, thereby improving the robustness and reliability of object detectors. The performance of an object detector depends on how cross-modality features are extracted and fused. To exploit the different modalities fully, we propose a lightweight yet effective cross-modality feature fusion approach named gated weighted normative feature fusion. In the feature extraction stage, our proposed dual-input backbone network can extract richer and more useful features. In the feature fusion stage, the fusion module can eliminate redundant features, dynamically weigh the importance of two image features, and further normalize fused features. Experiments and ablation studies on several publicly available datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our method. Our proposed method achieved better performance in terms of mAP50 with 80.3%, mAP with 41.8%, and mAP50 with 98.0%, mAP with 68.0% on the FLIR and LLVIP datasets, respectively. In particular, the inference speed of our method is twice as fast as the current state-of-the-art method.",

      "abstract": "Surface inspection plays an important role in manufacturing of parts with complicated geometry. Specifically, the timely detection of minor defects, e.g., dent and scratches, in small-sized parts such as engine blades before acceptance is usually the final step of quality assurance. Current practice, however, mainly relies on human decision which is subjective and labor intense. In this research we propose an automated, image-based inspection system that utilizes robotic automation to acquire images of a part being inspected and employs machine learning to facilitate decision making. The data acquisition aims at high-resolution images that can thoroughly reflect the surface features of parts. While deep learning is leveraged, a series of advancements are designed to overcome the challenges of limited data and especially limited number of labels (i.e., parts with defects) during the initial training process. We synthesize a semi-supervised learning framework, building upon the residual neural network (ResNet) as well as the deep convolutional generative adversarial network (DCGAN), to extract features from the ground truth data and synthetic data. The performance boost of synthetic samples is investigated with different dataset sizes and validated. Copyright \u00c2\u00a9 2023 by ASME.",

      "abstract": "Human drivers and machine drivers (i.e., automated vehicles or AVs) will share roads and interact with each other, creating mixed traffic. In this perspective, we develop two mental models about them and their social interactions, aiming to understand the risk implications of AVs and mixed traffic. Based on Mental Model I (i.e., machine drivers are superior drivers without human weaknesses), many simulation-based safety assessments, which often overlook or oversimplify human-AV social interactions, have predicted significant safety benefits when machine drivers interact with or replace human drivers. In contrast, Mental Model II considers human and machine drivers as heterogeneous and incompatible, suggesting that their interactions may lead to unexpected and occasionally negative outcomes, particularly in imminent mixed traffic. This perspective gains support from recent comparative empirical studies that employ various methods such as survey experiments, driving simulators, test-tracks, on-road observations, and AV accident analysis. These studies provide initial evidence of emerging traffic risks arising from human-AV social interactions, including human drivers\u00e2\u0080\u0099 aggression and road rage toward AVs, human drivers exploiting AVs, AVs exerting negative peer influences on human drivers, and their incompatibility increasing human drivers\u00e2\u0080\u0099 challenges in joining mixed traffic and thus risky behaviors. We propose specific suggestions to mitigate problematic human-AV social interactions and the associated emerging risks. \u00c2\u00a9 2023 Society for Risk Analysis.",

      "abstract": "Recent developments in cutting-edge robotics have been constantly faced with increased cyber-threats, not only in terms of the quantity or the frequency of attacks, but also when it comes to the quality and the severity of the intrusions. This paper provides a systematic overview and critical assessment of state-of-the-art scientific developments in the security aspects of robotics, autonomous systems, and critical infrastructures. Our review highlights open research questions addressing significant research gaps and/or new conceptual frameworks, considering recent advancements in artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning. Thus the contributions of this paper can be summarised as follows. We first compare and contrast the benefits of multiple cutting-edge AI-based learning algorithms (e.g., fuzzy logic and neural networks) relative to traditional model-based systems (e.g. distributed control and filtering). Subsequently, we point out some specific benefits of AI algorithms to quickly learn and adapt the dynamics of non-linear systems in the absence of complex mathematical models. We also present some potential future research directions (open challenges) in the field. Lastly, this review also delivers an open message to encourage collaborations among experts from multiple disciplines. The implementation of multiple AI algorithms to tackle current security issues in robotics will transform and create novel, hybrid knowledge for intelligent cybersecurity at the application level.

      "abstract": "Automotive Ethernet enables high-bandwidth in-vehicle networking, facilitating the transmission of sensor data among electronic control units. However, the increasing connectivity and potential vulnerability inheritance in connected and autonomous vehicles expose them to security risks. To address this challenge, an intrusion detection system (IDS) capable of analyzing automotive Ethernet traffic and detecting anomalies is essential. In thisarticle, we propose automotive Ethernet real-time observer (AERO), an unsupervised network IDS designed to protect in-vehicle networks. AERO consists of three components: a feature extractor that constructs three multimodal features, a neural network for processing the extracted features, and an online anomaly detector that calculates outlier scores in real time. We evaluate the performance of AERO using the TOW-IDS automotive Ethernet intrusion dataset. The experimental results demonstrate that AERO achieves high detection performance across five different attack types and is highly applicable to automotive-grade devices for real-time anomaly detection.

      "abstract": "With the advancement of technology in both combat and defensive situations, the requirement of the use of autonomous vehicles which carry payload is increasing. For the different types of targets, missiles are used. The missile guidance system calculates the miss distance and the trajectory dynamics through automated system. Using image processing, multiple types of target can be identifies. The use of image processing in the guiding system to differentiate between the objects may provide the contemporary error correction in the flight path. In this paper, multiple approaches are used for target identification, tracking and control of trajectory dynamics. The approach identifies two targets, a massive missile truck and an airplane. The algorithm successfully identifies target despite colour variances and almost equivalent structural arrangements. Further trajectory estimation of target is done through constant velocity and constant turn models. When utilising motion estimates and detection, real-world success depends on the ability to recognise visual targets. The Type 1 system\u2019s main objective is flight path management using the yaw, pitch, and roll axes. A common atmospheric model and a set of equations are used by the missile autopilot system to describe the aircraft. In MATLAB Simulink, a simulated missile attack travelling at 328&nbsp;m/s is modelled and simulated. In the model, the missile and its intended target came together at 3.5&nbsp;s.",

      "abstract": "The new wave of Industry 4.0 is transforming manufacturing factories into data-rich environments. This provides an unprecedented opportunity to feed large amount of sensing data collected from the physical factory into the construction of digital twin (DT) in cyberspace. However, little has been done to fully utilize the DT technology to improve the smartness and autonomous levels of small and medium-sized manufacturing factories. Indeed, only a small fraction of small and medium-sized manufacturers (SMMs) has considered implementing DT technology. There is an urgent need to exploit the full potential of data analytics and simulation-enabled DTs for advanced manufacturing. Hence, this paper presents the design and development of DT models for simulation optimization of manufacturing process flows. First, we develop a multi-agent simulation model that describes nonlinear and stochastic dynamics among a network of interactive manufacturing things, including customers, machines, automated guided vehicles (AGVs), queues, and jobs. Second, we propose a statistical metamodeling approach to design sequential computer experiments to optimize the utilization of AGV under uncertainty. Third, we construct two new graph models - job flow graph and AGV traveling graph - to track and monitor the real-time performance of manufacturing jobshops. The proposed simulation-enabled DT approach is evaluated and validated with experimental studies for the representation of a real-world manufacturing factory. Experimental results show that the proposed methodology effectively transforms a manufacturing jobshop into a new generation of DT-enabled smart factories. The sequential design of experiments effectively reduces the computation overhead of expensive simulations while optimally scheduling the AGV to achieve production throughputs in a cost-effective way. This research is strongly promised to help SMMs fully utilize big data and DT technologies for gaining competitive advantages in the global market. Copyright \u00c2\u00a9 2023 by ASME.",

A signal compression mechanism is proposed to mitigate network congestion. Additionally, an asymmetric Lyapunov-Krasovskii function (LKF) is introduced to reduce decision variables, and it is split into two parts to compensate for the asymmetry and increase the LKF energy, which approach helps to reduce the conservatism of the criterion. Furthermore, an integral-based event-triggered mechanism (IETM) supervised by a machine learning algorithm is developed to estimate the PE of NCSs. Finally, the effectiveness of the proposed method is demonstrated through verification on the automated ground vehicle (AGV) CarSim-Simulink joint platform, confirming its feasibility. IEEE",

An efficient FTS should posses high Signal to Noise Ratio, link robustness to ensure reliable communication between ground transmitting and onboard receiving systems and should be immune to interference. This article presents a detailed report on the requirement and features of FTS &amp; technologies used in it. Techniques such as tone based, code based and Code Division Multiple Access (CDMA) are considered. Analysis of RF spectrum, gain and noise figure measurement and channel power are presented. Advanced methods like Enhanced Flight Termination System (EFTS) and Autonomous Flight Termination System (AFTS) are considered which show supportable and upgradable technologies, better range understanding, unique vehicle id &amp; higher data rate. AFTS being self-reliant provides superior performance in terms of GPS, launch responsiveness, multiple flight vehicle control and auto pilot.",

      "abstract": "Conventional AD systems have been found less effective for countering UAVs and loitering munitions. Thishas necessitated the development of counter-UAV systems with different functionalities. A cluster of armed UAVsas swarm formations has further rendered the conventional AD systems far from effective, emphasizing the need to consider countering swarms as the most crucial element in new-generation aerial threat mitigation strategies. In this paper, the capabilities of UAV swarms and vital military assets exposed to such attacks are identified. To protect the vital assets from aerial swarm threats, ideal system characteristics of a counter-UAV (C-UAV) swarm system to overcome the challenges are discussed. Currently available acquisition &amp; engagement technology is analyzed and the application of these systems to counter swarm applications is brought out. New requirements are discussed and a conceptual design of a layered system is derived which can handle a large spectrum of aerial threats including a swarm of UAVs. This system is expected to have a higher rate of engagement and can be designed with low-cost network-integrated systems.",

We used a novel robotic transcranial Doppler (TCD) system equipped with artificial intelligence (AI) for real-time continuous intraoperative neuromonitoring during TAVR to establish the safety and potential validity of this tool in detecting cerebral emboli, report the quantity and distribution of high intensity transient signals (HITS) with and without cerebral protection, and correlate HITS occurrence with various procedural steps.</p><h3>Methods</h3>\n<p>Consecutive patients undergoing TAVR procedures during which the robotic system was used between October 2021 and May 2022 were prospectively enrolled in this pilot study. The robotic TCD system included autonomous adjustment of the TCD probes and AI-assisted post-processing of HITS and other cerebral flow parameters. Basic demographics and procedural details were recorded. Continuous variables were analyzed by a two-sample Mann\u2013Whitney t-test and categorical variables by a \u03c7<sup>2</sup> or Fisher test.</p><h3>Results</h3>\n<p>Thirty-one patients were prospectively enrolled (mean age 79.9\u00b17.6 years; 16 men (51.6%)). Mean aortic valve stenotic area was 0.7\u2009cm<sup>2</sup> and mean aortic\u2013ventricular gradient was 43\u2009mmHg (IQR 31.5\u201350\u2009mmHg). Cerebral protection was used in 16 cases (51.6%). Significantly fewer emboli were observed in the protection group than in the non-protection group (mean 470.38 vs 693.33; p=0.01). Emboli counts during valve positioning and implantation were significantly different in the protection and non-protection groups (mean 249.92 and 387.5, respectively; p=0.01). One (4%) transient ischemic attack occurred post-procedurally in the non-protection group.</p><h3>Conclusion</h3>\n<p>We describe a novel real-time intraoperative neuromonitoring tool used in patients undergoing TAVR. Significantly fewer HITS were detected with protection. Valve positioning\u2013implantation was the most significant stage for intraprocedural HITS.</p>",

      "abstract": "In the realm of miniature machine learning for Internet of Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs), the security concerns of machine learning models are obvious, especially when it comes to adversarial attacks. Models can become confused and their performance undermined by the introduction of meticulously crafted distortions. These attacks can even infiltrate a variety of models, bringing greater security risks. To understand how it works and mitigate its effects, our research focuses on scrutinizing the transferability of adversarial attacks in the expanding context of miniature machine learning for UAVs. In this paper, we introduce a formula help measure the transferability of adversarial attacks and explore ways to improve the transferability and effectiveness of adversarial attacks (e.g., a combination of attack techniques), and provide visulizations to vividly illustrate the repercussions of adversarial instances across a spectrum of attack intensities, helping facilitate more intuitive exploration and analysis of the results. For instance, our findings demonstrate that even subtle perturbations directed at specific attributes can lead to a significant decrease in model accuracy. We also evaluates the success rates of various attack algorithms and validates the proposed evaluation methodology for measuring transferability. And the outcomes unveiled in this study make noteworthy strides in fostering a profound comprehension of the transferability of adversarial attacks in the distinct realm of miniature machine learning for UAVs. Robust defense mechanisms, which ensure the impregnability of IoT-enabled UAV systems, can be cultivated by pinpointing the most efficacious attack strategies and evaluating their transferability.

      "abstract": "Introduction: The World Health Organization (WHO) designated Carbapenem-resistant Enterobacterales (CRE), formerly Enterobacteriaceae, among the global priority list of antibiotic-resistant bacteria. The rate of CRE in Arabian countries, including Saudi Arabia has increased. Here, we report the prevalence of carbapenemase-producing Klebsiella pneumoniae (CPKP) in the Jazan region, a southern coastal province of Saudi Arabia. Methodology: Eighty-six non-repetitive clinical isolates of K. pneumoniae that showed resistance to at least one of the carbapenem drugs were collected from three tertiary hospitals in the Jazan region from March 2020 to April 2021. The identification and antimicrobial susceptibility testing (AST) of isolates were performed using various automated systems. Molecular detection of carbapenemase genes was conducted using a multiplex PCR. Results: Out of the 86 tested CRKP isolates, 64 (74.4%) were carbapenemase-producing isolates. The blaOXA-48 gene was the most predominant carbapenemase gene, detected in 65.1% (n = 56) of isolates. The blaNDM gene was detected in only 9.3% (n = 8) of isolates; three were found to be co-harbored with blaVIM. Interestingly, one isolate of CRKP was found to have carbapenemase genes (blaNDM, blaVIM and blaKPC), which was associated with COVID-19 patient. Conclusions: The incidence of carbapenemase-producing K. pneumoniae in Jazan hospitals seemed to be high, confirming the continued prevalence of carbapenem resistance in Saudi Hospitals. We report K. pneumoniae strain with triple carbapenemase genes in southern Saudi Arabia. The emergence of such an isolate could threaten patients and healthcare workers and requires great attention to rapid interventions to avoid further dissemination, particularly during the COVID-19 pandemic.

      "abstract": "The unmanned system is always employed in the uncontrolled radiation source accidents, tackling with geometric field mapping, obstacle avoidance exploration and radiation sources localization simultaneously. To balance the multiple subtasks, a novel source seeking and exploration strategy is proposed in this paper. Firstly, the geometric metric map and radioactive topology map are constructed respectively, while the evaluation functions are established to merge above both maps into the hybrid costmap. Additionally, the RRT* structure is introduced into the path planning module, leading to the capabilities of full-map expansion and multi-source exploitation. By combining the costmap with RRT* structure, the topological paths which satisfy source seeking and map exploration can be generated in the cluttered environment. Experimental results verify the effectiveness of the multi-task path planner, taking into account both multisource exploitation and environment exploration in an online manner.",

      "abstract": "Loop Heat Pipes (LHPs) are efficient heat transfer devices, providing a highly efficient and energy-saving thermal control integrated management method for Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) with their flexible structural design. In this paper, a conceptual design of LHP anti-icing system was proposed, using LHP to transfer waste heat to wing\u2019s leading edge. The outer surface temperature of wing skin is one of the main indicators to measure the anti-icing effect. As a result, this paper mainly focused on the heat transfer process of the condenser section by experimental and numerical simulation methods. A stainless steel-nickel LHP was fabricated and tested at different conditions. Volume of Fluid (VOF) method and Lee model were adopted to simulate the condensation process. Results showed that increasing the heating power (from 35W to 60W) slowed down the condensation and lengthened the two-phase zone. However, when the angle of attack changes within the range of 0\u00b0 -10\u00b0, the liquid-vapor distribution in the tube remains almost unchanged. The average error of surface temperature between experiment and simulation results is 3.6% and 2.5% for the heating power of 180 W and 60 W respectively. Additionally, because the volume of water droplets collected is the largest at the leading edge of the wing, we recommend arranging the LHP condenser tube inlet near the leading edge of the wing and increasing the density of pipe arrangement to achieve better anti-icing effect.",

      "abstract": "A blockchain based platform can be decentralized, meaning that it is not controlled by a single entity or organization. This can help to cut down the risk of data manipulation or fraud, and can also make the platform more resilient to cyber-attacks or other security threats. By automating many of the processes involved in data collection and analysis, blockchain technology can assist farmers to decrease their costs and increase profitability. Architecture for blockchain powered IoT platform for autonomous drone operations in smart farming is proposed. It has three layers which include data acquistion and encryption in IoT layer and creation and management of ledger in the blockchain layer and service provider layer that include user interaction and farming software. Agriculture integrates many of the new automation technologies already in their routine. The proposed architecture enriches the functioning of farming without affecting the current framework. Overall, the blockchain powered IoT platform for autonomous drone operations in smart farming can help farmers improve their efficiency, increase transparency and security, reduce costs, and ultimately achieve more environment sustainability and profitable farming practices. \u00c2\u00a9 Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.",

      "abstract": "Herein, a twin-boom, inverted V-tailed unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) featuring a foldable bi-wing configuration is proposed for logistics and transportation applications. We employed the Navier&#x2013;Stokes solver to numerically simulate steady, incompressible flow conditions. By examining the effects of key design parameters on aerodynamic characteristics and bypass flow fields in a two-dimensional state, we were able to suggest a more optimized foldable wing design. Building on the two-dimensional analysis, we performed aerodynamic assessments of the three-dimensional aircraft geometry. Our results indicated that appropriate wing and gap parameters can significantly enhance lift characteristics, maintaining high lift even during large-angle flights. Specifically, when compared to a mono-wing, the lift coefficient of the bi-wing increased by 27.1&#x0025; at a 14&#x00B0; angle of attack, demonstrating the effectiveness of our wing-and-gap design. Optimal aerodynamic performance was achieved when the gap distance equalled the chord length in both flow and vertical directions. Further, the right combination of airfoil configuration, wing axes angle, and wingspan can improve flow field aerodynamic characteristics, while also enhancing the wing&#x2019;s stall capacity. The lift coefficient reached its maximum value at an angle of attack of 15&#x00B0;, which has the potential to reduce takeoff and landing distances, thereby enhancing the UAV&#x2019;s overall safety.",

      "abstract": "Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) offer a solution for remote inspection of wind turbines. However, in stormy weather conditions, the visual quality of UAV-taken images is affected by contaminated suspended atmospheric particles. To address this problem, a double-patch lightweight convolutional dehazing neural network (DPLDN) is proposed to reconstruct hazy images and enhance the image quality. Unlike other learning-based methods that measure transmission map and atmospheric light separately, the proposed DPLDN uses a transformed atmospheric scattering model to jointly transmission map and atmospheric light, employs depth-separable convolution instead of conventional convolution, and splits the image into double patches. In addition, a super-resolution reconstruction method is proposed to transform the processed low-resolution images into higher-quality images. Extensive experiments shows that our proposed method has better dehazing performance compared to other state-of-the-art image dehazing techniques. Meanwhile, the applicability of the method in wind turbine blade image segmentation is experimentally verified. IEEE",

      "abstract": "With the evolutional development of maritime networks, the explosive growth of maritime data has put forward elevated demands for the computing capabilities of maritime devices (MDs). Unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) is able to alleviate the computing pressure of MDs by forwarding the computing tasks to the edge server on the coast. However, UAV relaying introduces a significant security challenge due to the vulnerability of line-of-sight (LoS) communication channels, which can be exploited for eavesdropping on computing tasks. In this paper, an efficient secure communication scheme is proposed for UAV-relay-assisted maritime mobile edge computing (MEC) with a flying eavesdropper. The secure computing capacity of MDs is maximized by jointly optimizing the transmit power, time slot allocation factor, computation optimization and UAV trajectory. Due to multi-variable coupling, the formulated optimization problem (OP) is non-convex. We first transform OP by introducing auxiliary variables. Then, the transformed OP is decomposed and solved in an iterative manner by applying block coordinate descent (BCD) and successive convex approximation (SCA). Numerical results show that the secure computing capability of the UAV-relay-assisted maritime MEC system of proposed secure communication scheme can be effectively improved compared with benchmarks.

      "abstract": "This paper addresses the challenge of generating safety-critical scenarios with multiple adversarial vehicles for testing autonomous vehicles. Such scenarios must be plausible and collision-avoidable while resulting in a collision with the vehicle-under-test. However, the tremendous number of scenarios and the low ratio of plausible scenarios makes previous methods squander primary resources on implausible scenarios, degenerating their efficiency. We propose a two-stage framework called the ASP-based Avoidable Collision Scenario Testbench (A2CoST) to overcome this obstacle and improve efficiency. In the former stage, we apply Answer Set Programming (ASP) for generating plausible logical scenarios. In the latter stage, we use a search algorithm to refine logical scenarios into safety-critical concrete scenarios. We also compute collision-free trajectories in these concrete scenarios while the vehicle-under-test fails to avoid the collision. We empirically show the A2CoST significantly decreases the time consumption for simple scenarios while still effectively generating complex critical scenarios. The comparison with real-world traffic data further demonstrates the value of A2CoST in generating plausible scenarios.

Accurate surveying techniques are crucial tomodel populations, detect over and under populations, and address them accordingly. This work proposes a process for creating a biodiversitymodel of a forest\u2019s fauna using uncrewed aerial vehicles equipped with RGB and thermal cameras. Real-world data, combined with computer-generated imagery and artificial intelligencemodels, will allow training suitable computer visionmodels. Thesemodels will serve as a reliable and objective data source, enabling the creation of statistical models to describe themonitored forests\u2019 conditions and the biodiversity of its fauna. The proposedmethodology is expected to have significant implications for conservation efforts. It should represent a reliable and efficient way tomonitor and evaluate forest ecosystems, identifying areas of concern and prioritizing conservation efforts. By providing a comprehensive understanding of the biodiversity within a forest, it could help policymakers make informed decisions and develop effective conservation strategies.

      "abstract": "Rural public transport is typically limited in its coverage, frequency and service period. This is often linked to a low and dispersed demand, which makes the provision of competitive transport services often financially unsustainable. Autonomous vehicles (AVs) might change this condition, allowing for an upgrade of public transport in rural areas. Nevertheless, current studies are mostly focused on urban areas, while the potential for rural applications remains underexplored. This paper contributes to this research line by developing a set of so-called AV scenarios for a potential upgrade of public transport in the rural study area of M\u00fchlwald (South Tyrol, Italy). These scenarios are designed following three core principles. First, line-based and on-demand applications of AVs are not only individually tested, but even combined over space and time in different manners to exploit their synergy. Second, the performances of the scenarios are quantified by assuming the today\u00b4s agency cost budget, public-transport demand and peak-hour system capacity to be fixed parameters to comply with. Third, the uncertainties regarding the impacts of AVs on the agency costs are taken into account by defining optimistic, neutral and pessimistic variants of each scenario. Results indicate that the full replacement of current bus lines with a system of on-demand shared taxis might provide the highest performance improvements with the same budget as today, but only with a much bigger fleet. At the same time, the combination of bus lines and on-demand services over time (and space) might provide similarly competitive results while keeping the needed fleet size, service distance and service time relatively low. With this study, policy makers may get insights into the potential improvements of rural public transport that might be initially obtained with different uses of AVs, given a fixed agency cost budget and demand.",

      "abstract": "Object detection plays a vital role in numerous fields, including unmanned vehicles, security, and industry, among others. However, recent studies have shown that object detection models based on deep learning are vulnerable to adversarial example attacks. This poses significant challenges to the robustness of the models and substantially limits the applicability of object detection in critical security scenarios. Many existing adversarial attack methods for object detection focus primarily on specific types of object detection models. However, a widespread issue persists regarding weak transferability across different models. Furthermore, there is considerable room for enhancing the success rate of these attacks. To tackle these challenges, this paper proposes a data augmentation framework that leverages on the similarity between adversarial example generation and neural network training. Instead of utilizing the current gradient directly during the iterative process of calculating the gradient, the proposed method employs a weighted average gradient obtained by combining multiple data augmentation methods randomly. Additionally, the method combines the data-augmented gradients with momentum to obtain the gradients applicable to the adversarial attack in order to stabilize the update direction and avoid overfitting to the white-box model. The performance of the proposed method in attacking object detection models is evaluated on the MS COCO dataset using Faster R-CNN, YOLOv3 and YOLOv8. The experimental results demonstrate that, when compared to Projective Gradient Descend method and Iterative Fast Gradient Sign Method, the proposed method outperforms in both white-box and black-box settings. The transfer success rate achieved is up to 81.9% on RetinaNet.",

      "abstract": "Recent studies in surgical robotics have focused on automating common surgical subtasks such as grasping and manipulation using deep reinforcement learning (DRL). In this work, we consider surgical endoscopic camera control for object tracking e.g. using the endoscopic camera manipulator (ECM) from the da Vinci Research Kit (dVRK) (Intuitive Inc., Sunnyvale, CA, USA) as a typical surgical robot learning task. A DRL policy for controlling the robot joint space movements is first trained in a simulation environment and then continues the learning in the real world. To speed up training and avoid significant failures (in this case, losing view of the object), human interventions are incorporated into the training process and regular DRL is combined with generative adversarial imitation learning (GAIL) to encourage imitating human behaviors. Experiments show that an average reward of 159.8 can be achieved within 1000 steps compared to only 121.8 without human interventions, and the view of the moving object is lost only twice during the training process out of 3 trials. These results show that human interventions can improve learning speed and significantly reduce failures during the training process. \u00c2\u00a9 2023 World Scientific Publishing Co. Pte Ltd.

      "abstract": "Integrating Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) into wireless communication as aerial platforms to mount small cell base stations has grown rapidly in recent years. One of the main objectives of UAV integration into wireless networks is to optimize UAV deployment while meeting user expectations with the fewest UAVs. To ensure that users receive the requested data rate, management of UAV placement and user association is necessary due to the limited capacity of aerial base stations. Besides the user-base station distance, environmental conditions and propagation mode affect the data rate received by the users. When accounting for uncertain conditions, network management decisions become more realistic and productive. This paper considers a random propagation mode for each link depending on the environmental conditions of the desired area. We exploit the stochastic programming framework to reflect propagation mode uncertainty in the optimization problem, which impacts the received data rate and path loss. The suggested mathematical formulation determines the minimum number of required UAVs, their 3D positions, and the best user association strategy. The proposed model also includes interference-aware constraints for optimal radio resource allocation to base stations. The nonlinear path loss and LoS probability distribution functions in terms of the base station positions lead to a non-linear formulation. We obtain a mixed-binary linear formulation by replacing non-linear functions with their piecewise linear approximations and solve the model accurately using the CPLEX solver. The implementation results show that stochastic approaches provide more accurate diagnoses of the environment, as well as superior performance to deterministic optimization. IEEE",

      "abstract": "Autonomous vehicles heavily rely on various sensors to evaluate their surroundings and issue essential control commands. Nonetheless, these sensors are susceptible to false data injection and spoofing attacks, posing a significant security threat. In response, this paper proposes a channel-spatial-temporal attention-based autoencoder network to detect sensor spoofing attacks on autonomous vehicles. The innovative network utilizes the reconstruction error based on the autoencoder to detect abnormalities in input time series data collected from multiple sensors. The proposed model consists of a memory-augmented based spatial-attention block and PSE-Res2Net block-based encoder and decoder. PSE-Res2Net block initially adopts Res2Net module to generate a multi-scale feature graph and enhance multi-dimensional representation ability of neural network, then applies the PSENet module to capture location-aware channel information and channel-sensitive spatial information through the interaction of channel attention and spatial attention. Moreover, the memory-augmented based temporal-attention block is developed to integrate multi-scale features and aggregate global sequence information of sensor measurements. Experimental evaluations conducted on the comma2k19, KITTI, and CCSAD datasets illustrate the superiority of the proposed detection model over baseline technologies. It exhibits enhanced performance in terms of mPre, mRe, mF1 score, and showcases heightened resilience against noise and attacks.",

      "abstract": "Traditional techniques to evaluate well's integrity employed for assessing mechanical integrity often come with high operational costs and logistical expenses, as they require the interruption of production or injection processes (1). Consequently, these conventional methods can be impractical and hinder overall efficiency. However, the emergence of autonomous and intelligent intervention systems has paved the way for a significant advancement in this field. These innovative systems possess the capability to make real-time decisions in dynamic and unstructured environments. By using artificial intelligence technologies, it can autonomously evaluate mechanical integrity without human intervention. One of the primary benefits of maintaining mechanical integrity is the assurance of safety and operational efficiency. The integrity of well structures prevents the occurrence of leaks, ruptures, or collapses, which can lead to catastrophic incidents and environmental damage. By employing autonomous and intelligent intervention systems, companies can proactively monitor the mechanical of wells, mitigating potential risks and avoiding costly operational disruptions. These advanced systems are designed to monitor and assess critical parameters such as pressure, temperature, and flow. The real-time decision-making capability of autonomous intervention systems significantly reduces response times to potential integrity threats. By identifying issues, operators can prevent the escalation of problems and minimize associated costs. In addition to improving operational efficiency and safety, autonomous and intelligent intervention systems also offer long-term cost savings. By implementing proactive monitoring strategies, companies can optimize their resource allocation and extend the lifespan of wells. This, in turn, reduces the frequency of costly interventions and enhances overall operational profitability representing a significant leap forward in evaluating well's integrity. By reducing the need for traditional, costly techniques and enabling real-time decision-making equipment, these systems enhance safety, efficiency, and cost-effectiveness. Studies (2, 3) demonstrates that the utilization of RLWI (Rigless Well Intervention) systems can significantly reduce the costs associated with well intervention. Also, the utilization of robotic solutions, as example, wireline tractors have been proved as an excellent solution to improve the efficiency and reliability of well integrity (4, 5, 6). The paper will describe the progress made in developing a modular, autonomous mobile robotic platform for through-tubing operation. We outline the stages of prototype development, current project status, and tests. We also provide details on the artificial intelligence control and autonomous decision-making systems. Finally, we plan to present simulation and field test results in the final section of the paper. \u00c2\u00a9 2023, Society of Petroleum Engineers.",

      "abstract": "As Wireless Sensor Networks (WSN) uses the open channel for communication between the end users and the resource-constrained sensors; maintaining privacy and security is always a challenging task. In this context, Khalid et al. proposed a biometric-based user authentication and Key agreement (AKA) scheme in WSN based on intelligent sensors. However, during this research, it is found that the schemes have many computational flaws and are under the threat of different attacks, such as Impersonation attacks, Stolen Smart Card (SC) attacks, etc. So, to overcome the vulnerabilities found in Khalid et al.\u2019s scheme, an improved robust mutual AKA scheme for WSNs having intelligent sensors is proposed in this article. Moreover, the correctness of the scheme is verified by Burrows\u2013Abadi\u2013Needham (BAN) logic, and the security is proved by Automated Validation of Internet Security Protocols and Applications (AVISPA) simulation tool. Through various security analysis, performance evaluation and comparison with the existing related schemes shows that the proposed scheme could not only highly resistance against various well-known attacks than others but also maintain the low cost at sensor nodes, as well.",

      "abstract": "Decreased availability and rising cost in labor poses a serious threat to the long-term profitability and sustainability of the apple industry in the United States and many other countries. Harvest automation is thus urgently needed. In this paper, we present the unified system design and field evaluation of a new apple harvesting robot. The robot is mainly composed of a specially designed perception component, a four-degree-of-freedom manipulator, an improved vacuum-based soft end-effector, and a dropping/catching component to receive and transport picked fruits. Software algorithms are developed to enable synergistic coordination of the hardware components for efficient, automated harvesting of apples in challenging orchard environments. Specifically, by integrating modified triangulation and image processing and analysis algorithms, a novel perception strategy is developed to achieve robust apple detection and precise localization. Improved planning and control algorithms are developed to guide the robot to the target positions. The performance of the robotic system was evaluated through field tests in two apple orchards with different tree architectures and foliage conditions. In the orchard where trees were young and well-pruned, the robot achieved 82.4% successful harvesting rate. In a second, older orchard with dense, clustered branches and foliage, the robot had 65.2% successful rate. The average cycle time to harvest a fruit was approximately 6 s, which included software algorithm processing and hardware execution. Moreover, through an in-depth analysis of the obtained results, limitations and planned future works are discussed. \u00c2\u00a9 2023 The Authors.

Particularly, we first adopt the expectation conditional maximization (ECM) and extended Kalman filtering (EKF) methods to extract fingerprints from the received signals. Then, we formulate the problem of PHY-layer authentication as a binary hypothesis testing. Moreover, we theoretically derive the analytical expressions for the false alarm and detection probabilities based on the statistical analysis. Finally, extensive numerical simulations demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed scheme and validate the correctness of the developed theoretical models. \u00c2\u00a9 2023 IEEE.",

      "abstract": "Digital Twin (DT) technology, as a promising technology, can achieve the vehicular contexts mapping of the virtual world and physical world in a collaborative autonomous driving (CAD) system. DT technology is developed on the basis of C-V2X, 6G, Mobile Edge Computing (MEC), Machine Learning (ML) and other technologies, which can enable the creation of robust and reliable digital twin-based collaborative autonomous driving architectures, providing a platform for testing, validating, and refining autonomous driving systems in a highly efficient and safe manner. However, the future large-scale CAD system needs greater real-time processing and resource collaboration capability for autonomous vehicles (AVs). Especially considering the mobility of AVs, it puts higher demands on the management of AVs. In this paper, we present a digital twin (DT)-based collaborative autonomous driving (DTCAD) three-layer architecture in C-V2X to provide better resource management of AVs. In order to improve the Quality of Service (QoS) and reduce the processing latency in large-scale CAD scenarios, a scalable Deep Reinforcement Learning and Mean Field Game method (DDPG-MFG) are proposed, where the dynamic and real-time interaction between AVs is approximated as a mean-field gaming process in DT resource allocation. Especially, to improve the interaction efficiency between AVs and CAD environment, we design more efficient exploitation and exploration algorithms for AVs. The CARLA simulation demonstrates our proposed algorithm significantly reduces the task offloading latency, and improves the average rewards by 28.5%, 3.5%, and 6.8%, compared with traditional DDPG, TD3, and AC, respectively.

      "abstract": "Mars exploration is a hotspot in human planetary exploration. Rotary unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) offer advantages such as vertical takeoff/landing and flexibility, enhancing Mars exploration efficiency. However, the low temperature and low density Martian atmosphere lead to the rotor flow field being in a low Reynolds and high Mach number state, causing laminar separation and impacting aerodynamics. To improve Martian rotorcraft aerodynamics, the NACA0012-34 rotor airfoil\u2019s aerodynamic characteristics and surface suction control technology were studied numerically under Martian conditions. By obtaining the NACA0012-34 airfoil\u2019s basic flow characteristics in the Martian atmosphere, the suction control technology was proposed, the effects and mechanisms of surface suction on inhibiting laminar separation and enhancing airfoil lift were studied, the influence of suction position, velocity ratio, and hole width on flow control effectiveness was explored. Findings demonstrate effective suppression of laminar separation and enhanced airfoil lift through suction control under the Martian atmosphere. The relative position of the suction hole and the separation starting point is a critical factor in determining the effectiveness of suction control. Moreover, selecting an appropriate suction velocity ratio and suction hole width can further contribute to increasing the lift of the airfoil.",

      "abstract": "To achieve sustainable development goals, it is crucial to ensure the best practices through the whole mining cycle of Critical Raw Materials (CRM) used in high-tech, low-carbon goods (batteries, wind turbines, electronics). This is the aim of the Secure and Sustainable Supply of Raw Materials for EU Industry (S34I) Horizon Europe (HE) project that began on January 1st, 2023. S34I is investigating new data-driven methods to analyze Earth Observation (EO) data, supporting systematic mineral exploration (and other) activities to increase European autonomy regarding CRM resources. The S34I project is based on satellite data, airborne, Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV), ground-based conventional in-situ techniques/methods, and fieldwork. This study presents the first preliminary results based on Sentinel-1 and Sentinel-2 data using classical image processing techniques (RGB combinations, band ratio, Principal Component  Analysis \u2013 PCA, and unsupervised classification) for mineral exploration in Spain, either: (i) on land (Aramo area), to gain  knowledge on cobalt (Co) deposits (and associate CRMs) by hydrothermal alteration mapping; and (ii) offshore/shallow waters (Ria de Vigo area), to update the knowledge on coastal metallic placers including CRMs such as Ti, Sn, Li, Rare Earth Elements (REEs) and Au. Among the techniques, PCA proved most effective, followed by band ratios, and self-proposed algorithms for detecting placer minerals showed promise, warranting further investigation. In the future, S34I will exploit Copernicus Contributing Missions (CCM) and other EU hyperspectral satellite sensors such as PRISMA and EnMAP. Different Artificial Intelligence (AI) techniques will, in the future, promote advances and innovative methods that mining stakeholders can use to address the challenges faced in different phases of the mining life cycle.

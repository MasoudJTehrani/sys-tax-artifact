      "abstract": "Breeders have made important efforts to develop genotypes able to resist virus attacks in sweetpotato, a major crop providing food security and poverty alleviation to smallholder farmers in many regions of Sub-Saharan Africa, Asia and Latin America. However, a lack of accurate objective quantitative methods for this selection target in sweetpotato prevents a consistent and extensive assessment of large breeding populations. In this study, an approach to characterize and classify resistance in sweetpotato was established by assessing total yield loss and virus load after the infection of the three most common viruses (SPFMV, SPCSV, SPLCV). Twelve sweetpotato genotypes with contrasting reactions to virus infection were grown in the field under three different treatments: pre-infected by the three viruses, un-infected and protected from re-infection, and un-infected but exposed to natural infection. Virus loads were assessed using ELISA, (RT-)qPCR, and loop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP) methods, and also through multispectral reflectance and canopy temperature collected using an unmanned aerial vehicle. Total yield reduction compared to control and the arithmetic sum of (RT-)qPCR relative expression ratios were used to classify genotypes into four categories: resistant, tolerant, susceptible, and sensitives. Using 14 remote sensing predictors, machine learning algorithms were trained to classify all plots under the said categories. The study found that remotely sensed predictors were effective in discriminating the different virus response categories. The results suggest that using machine learning and remotely sensed data, further complemented by fast and sensitive LAMP assays to confirm results of predicted classifications could be used as a high throughput approach to support virus resistance phenotyping in sweetpotato breeding. \u00c2\u00a9 2023",

      "abstract": "This paper highlights the significance of Artificial Intelligence (AI) in the realm of drone applications in forestry. Drones have revolutionized various forest operations, and their role in mapping, monitoring, and inventory procedures is explored comprehensively. Leveraging advanced imaging technologies and data processing techniques, drones enable real-time tracking of changes in forested landscapes, facilitating effective monitoring of threats such as fire outbreaks and pest infestations. They expedite forest inventory by swiftly surveying large areas, providing precise data on tree species identification, size estimation, and health assessment, thus supporting informed decision-making and sustainable forest management practices. Moreover, drones contribute to tree planting, pruning, and harvesting, while monitoring reforestation efforts in real-time. Wildlife monitoring is also enhanced, aiding in the identification of conservation concerns and informing targeted conservation strategies. Drones offer a safer and more efficient alternative in search and rescue operations within dense forests, reducing response time and improving outcomes. Additionally, drones equipped with thermal cameras enable early detection of wildfires, enabling timely response, mitigation, and preservation efforts. The integration of AI and drones holds immense potential for enhancing forestry practices and contributing to sustainable land management. In the future explainable AI (XAI) improves trust and safety by providing transparency in decision-making, aiding in liability issues, and enabling precise operations. XAI facilitates better environmental monitoring and impact analysis, contributing to efficient forest management and preservation efforts. If a drone's AI can explain its actions, it will be easier to understand why it chose a particular path or action, which could inform safety procedures and improvements. \u00c2\u00a9 2023 The Author(s)",

      "abstract": "Commotio cordis is a rare but life-threatening condition characterized by sudden cardiac arrest resulting from a blunt chest impact. While commotio cordis has traditionally been associated with sports-related activities, a significant proportion of cases occur in non-sport-related settings, such as assaults, motor vehicle accidents (MVAs), and daily activities. This critical review examines the epidemiology, clinical characteristics, and outcomes of non-sports-related commotio cordis cases, highlighting the need for increased awareness and improved management in these contexts. The review analyzes existing literature, drawing attention to the demographics of non-sports-related cases, which predominantly affect adolescents and young adults, with males being the primary demographic. In contrast to sport-related cases, non-sports-related commotio cordis cases exhibit a wider age range and a higher proportion of female subjects. Mortality rates are significantly higher in non-sports-related commotio cordis cases, largely due to lower rates of cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR), limited access to automated external defibrillators (AEDs), and delayed initiation of resuscitative efforts compared to sport-related incidents. This underscores the critical importance of increasing awareness and preparedness in non-sport-related settings. To mitigate the risks associated with non-sports-related commotio cordis, efforts should focus on early recognition of the condition, timely administration of CPR, and the widespread availability and accessibility of AEDs in various environments. Enhanced awareness and education can potentially lead to a reduction in mortality and improved outcomes for individuals affected by commotio cordis outside of sports-related activities. In conclusion, commotio cordis is not exclusive to sports and presents a significant health risk in non-sport-related scenarios. This review emphasizes the urgent need for increased awareness, preparedness, and resuscitation measures in non-sports contexts to address the higher mortality associated with these cases. \u00c2\u00a9 2023 Elsevier Inc.",

      "abstract": "Deep learning networks, emerging machine learning models that present beyond human-level performance in terms of accuracy, are critically vulnerable to adversarial attacks. This vulnerability limits the utilization of deep learning architecture in many real-world safety-critical applications such as autonomous vehicles, medical diagnosis, sensitive industrial systems, etc. Adversarial attacks are methods to measure the robustness of different architectures and can be used to evaluate the suitability of a model to be used in a safety-critical situation. White-box sparse adversarial attacks can unhide interesting features of deep learning networks by identifying critical elements in the input pattern to design black-box attacks. This motivated us to design a new algorithmic procedure to design sparse adversarial attacks to feed-forward neural networks based on sparsity regularization. The proposed method comes with the gradual sparsification which starts by designing a dense attack and prone it until a desired level of sparsity is attained. We evaluate the performance of the proposed algorithm in designing attacks on convolutional neural networks and attention-based architectures for image classification task using three non-smooth sparsity-promoting regularizers. Compared to the state-of-the-art sparse attack schemes, we show that the proposed method can significantly decrease the time needed to design the attack, while the perturbation distortion is unchanged or reduced in some cases. \u00c2\u00a9 2023 Elsevier Ltd",

      "abstract": "In order to fully exploit the variable wheelbase characteristics of the unmanned ground vehicle (UGV) with variable configuration, this paper proposes an adaptive heading tracking control strategy based on wheelbase changes. This strategy involves adjusting the wheelbase according to different working conditions to optimize various driving performance aspects. Firstly, the impact of changing wheelbase on the response characteristics of sideslip angle and heading angle relative to the front-wheel steering angle is analyzed by using a lateral vehicle dynamic model. The configurations where the 2nd axle moves forward by 0.5 m, remains unchanged, and moves backward by 0.5 m are defined as the \u00e2\u0080\u0098stable configuration\u00e2\u0080\u0099, \u00e2\u0080\u0098balanced configuration\u00e2\u0080\u0099, and \u00e2\u0080\u0098maneuverable configuration\u00e2\u0080\u0099, respectively. Considering time lag effects of hydraulic systems and external random noise interference, a robust-active disturbance rejection control (r-ADRC) method is developed by incorporating a robust term into active disturbance rejection control (ADRC) in order to achieve desired front-wheel steering angle. Additionally, a torque distribution method based on the tire load rate and the real-time vertical load of each wheel is applied to ensure uniform tire wear and enhance longitudinal driving stability. Finally, simulations under various typical working conditions as well as scaled prototype experiments are conducted, and both the theory behind the changing wheelbases and the effectiveness of proposed control strategy are verified. According to different vehicle configurations and mission requirements, the maneuverability and stability of the ground unmanned vehicle are ensured respectively. \u00c2\u00a9 2023",

      "abstract": "\u00e2\u0080\u0094 As a crucial component in power transmission lines, structural defects in dampers can significantly reduce their ability to suppress wire vibrations, posing a serious threat to the transmission line infrastructure. Most existing methods for damper defect detection are based on deep learning. However, these methods face challenges when applied to unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV)-captured images of dampers, as they often appear in complex backgrounds and contain small and densely distributed objects. This research aims to improve the accuracy and speed of damper defect recognition by proposing an attention-guided damper defect detection network called DSA-Net, which includes components such as damper attention (DA), Stile path aggregation network (Stile PAN), and ASFFs. First, to accurately extract the features of the damper while reducing background interference, a novel attention mechanism called DA is introduced, based on the shape of the damper and bidirectional stripe convolution. This mechanism allows the network to focus on key regions in the image without incurring expensive computational costs. Second, the Stile PAN feature fusion structure is employed to integrate shallow-level information of small targets. Finally, a single-layer ASFFs structure is utilized to autonomously learn information about small and densely distributed targets from the detection feature maps output by Stile PAN. On the transmission line damper (TLD) dataset, DSA-Net achieves an mAP0.5 of 0.935, an mAP0.5:0.95 of 0.789, and an inference speed of 7.2 ms. \u00c2\u00a9 2023 IEEE.",

      "abstract": "Multi-agent trajectory prediction plays a pivotal role for intelligent transportation and autonomous driving. Modeling the social interaction among agents and revealing the inherent relationship between interaction and future trajectory are crucial for accurate trajectory prediction. To address these challenges, this letter proposes a goal-guided and interaction-aware state refinement graph attention network (SRGAT) for multi-agent trajectory prediction. Specifically, the trajectory sequence of individual agent is firstly converted into a compact representation by exploiting Transformer encoder and gated recurrent unit (GRU). Then, a social state refinement (SSR) module for modeling social influence between agents is proposed to include more interaction-related features. Subsequently, multiple goals are predicted for each agent, followed by another goal-guided SSR module to incorporate goal information into social interaction. Finally, the multimodal trajectory is forecasted by fusing the features from forward and backward GRU.

      "abstract": "In recent years, the use of UAV images to monitor power transmission lines has become a popular method. However, the low quality of these images can present challenges for accurate monitoring. To address this issue, this study proposes a GAN-based model that enhances the resolution of UAV images captured from power transmission lines. This model utilizes a generator with a novel structure and loss function, which enables it to produce high-quality images with detailed edges and textures. In addition, the discriminator uses a new Siamese-network based architecture, making it capable of better distinguishing between real and fake images. Experimental results show that the proposed method outperforms state-of-the-art super-resolution models regarding producing high-quality images with finer details and higher values of PSNR, SSIM, and HaarPSI in shorter training and inference time. \u00c2\u00a9 2023 The Author(s)",

      "abstract": "Large Eddy Simulations (LES) of turbulent reacting flows carried out with detailed kinetic mechanisms have a key role for the discovery of the physical and chemical processes occurring in combustion systems, and are essential for the development of efficient, stable, and non-pollutant technologies. Nevertheless, these simulations require a large amount of computational resources, making their utilization for large-scale systems, such as industrial burners and gas turbines, impractical. In this work, we combine state-of-the-art machine learning algorithms and model reduction methods to deliver a fully automated strategy for performing LES with adaptive chemistry. This strategy is based on the Sample-Partitioning Adaptive Chemistry (SPARC) algorithmic procedure, which consists of four steps: the generation of a training dataset, its partitioning in clusters, the generation of a set of reduced chemical mechanisms specifically tailored to each cluster and, lastly, the numerical simulation of the case of interest with adaptive chemistry enabled by an on-the-fly classification of every grid point. The SPARC approach has already been demonstrated to substantially reduce the computational effort of reactive flows simulations. However a non-negligible level of user interventions is needed, upon which the method's success critically depend. Therefore, with the goal of boosting the performance of this workflow and minimise the user-specified degrees of freedom, we plug in and exploit the Local Principal Component Analysis augmented with an automated Bayesian-optimised search for optimal clustering solutions, and the Computational Singular Perturbation method with an additional layer of automation based on the Tangential Stretching Rate for minimally-sized reduced mechanisms. We employ a cheap and easy-to-generate 1-dimensional-flames training database and we demonstrate the efficiency, accuracy and robustness of this strategy with an application to LES of the Adelaide Jet in Hot Coflow (AJHC) burner, a turbulent reacting flow exhibiting intense turbulence-chemistry interactions. \u00c2\u00a9 2023 The Combustion Institute",

      "abstract": "\u00e2\u0080\u0094 As innovative technologies such as autonomous driving, over-the-air technology, and vehicle-to-everything are widely applied to intelligent connected vehicles, people can gain a more convenient and safer driving experience. Although the application of these technologies facilitates our lives, they also bring a series of vulnerable interfaces (such as 5G, Bluetooth, and WiFi), which pose a significant security threat to existing in-vehicle networks. To address these threats, researchers have proposed two mainstream schemes, including message authentication and intrusion detection system (IDS), where the scheme of message authentication needs to occupy the limited bandwidth of controller area network (CAN) bus. Furthermore, most IDSs either cannot locate the sender of the attack, fail to detect aperiodic malicious frames, or require prior knowledge of which CAN identifiers (IDs) belong to which electronic control units (ECUs). To address these weaknesses, we propose a practical voltage-based IDS named IdentifierIDS for real in-vehicle networks. To the best of our knowledge, it is the first scheme to detect intrusions by establishing a voltage fingerprint for each ID without the need for prior knowledge. This allows IdentifierIDS to detect both periodic and aperiodic malicious frames without occupying the limited bandwidth of the CAN bus. As a self-learning IDS, it can adapt to different in-vehicle networks without the need for customization for them. Experiments on three real vehicles demonstrate the robustness of our scheme in different in-vehicle networks. \u00c2\u00a9 2023 IEEE.

      "abstract": "To perform to their full capacity, Autonomous Ground Vehicles (AGV) require a powerful, dependable, and precise navigation system. Optical, inertial, signals-of-opportunity (SOPs), standalone and augmented Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS), and other modern technologies are used to construct such a system. In fact, the AGV navigation system heavily relies on the usage of GNSS. The key threats or errors of GNSS codHane and carrier phase observations include clock error, orbit error, ionospheric delay, and tropospheric delay. By minimising the errors and employing a relative positioning approach, an AGV may be positioned precisely. When using carrier phase observations, relative location precision up to the cm level is possible. The accuracy of relative position using GPS-L1, GLONASS-G1, BDS-B1, and GPS/BDS/GLONASS integrated system signals for AGV applications is therefore examined in this study work. A software-based framework is also developed to analyse the data and produce relative positioning results. \u00c2\u00a9 2024, Ismail Saritas. All rights reserved.",

This article will discuss how the high absorption losses of snowpacks lead to dynamic range requirements much stricter than FMCW radars used for automotive and other sensing applications, and how these requirements are met through antenna isolation, leakage calibration and exploitation of the range correlation effect. The article discusses in detail the implementation of the radar system, the CMOS microwave and digital circuitry, and the MTS antenna.

      "abstract": "Autonomous vehicles require a real-time positioning system with in-lane accuracy. They also require an autonomous onboard integrity monitoring (IM) technique to verify the estimated positions at a pre-defined probability. This can be computationally demanding. PPP-RTK is a promising positioning technique that can serve this purpose. Since PPP-RTK is developed to process undifferenced and uncombined (UDUC) observations for both network and user sides, it provides the residuals of the individual measurements. This can be exploited to reduce the computational load consumed in the fault detection and exclusion (FDE) process, included in the IM task, without compromising the positioning availability. This research proposes filtering the faulty satellites by the network, then the hardware and location-dependent faults at the user end can be identified. This is achieved by calculating the ratio between the matching UDUC residuals of the user receiver and the nearest reference station observations. This ratio is used to rank the individual observations where the observation with the largest ratio is most likely to be the faulty one. Therefore, it is more likely to identify the faulty observation without generating and testing numerous subsets. In addition, the exclusion can be attempted per observation, which preserves observation availability, unlike the grouping techniques that perform the exclusion per satellite. The method was examined in two test cases where geodetic and commercial receivers were used. Results show that the computational load has been reduced significantly by about 85\u201399% compared to the solution separation and Chi-squared test methods that are commonly used for FDE.",

      "abstract": "Mushrooms are economically valuable crops of high nutritional value. However, during cultivation they are continually threatened by fungal diseases, even in controlled-condition farm ecosystems. Fungal diseases significantly affect mushroom growth and can rapidly contaminate an entire crop. Farmer inspections can be hazardous to farmer health. This paper contributes an automated fungal disease detection system for the Sajor-caju mushrooms together with an intelligent farm system for precise cultivation environment control. The objective was to create and test a detection system that could detect fungal diseases rapidly, reduce farmer exposure to fungal spores, and alert farmers when fungal disease was detected. The system is composed of three parts: (i) a high-precision environment control system, (ii) an innovative imaging robot system, and (iii) a real-time fungal disease prognosis system using deep learning, with an alarm system. The trial results show that the real-time disease prognosis system has 94.35% precision (89.47% F1-score, n=13,500), and its twice daily inspections detect and report fungal disease typically within 6 to 12 h. The innovative farm\u00e2\u0080\u0099s overall capability for mushroom cultivation (environment control) is regarded as excellent and has precise control (99.6% capability, over 3-months). The innovative imaging robot\u00e2\u0080\u0099s overall operational trial performance is effective (at 99.7%). Moreover, the system effectively notifies farmers via smartphone when a fungal disease is detected. \u00c2\u00a9 2024, King Mongkut's Institute of Technology Ladkrabang. All rights reserved.",

      "abstract": "In modern warfare, unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) have become a vital military force. Planning feasible paths for UAVs has become an essential part of forming autonomous attack systems. Aiming at the task requirements of fix-wing UAVs, this paper proposes a ball security corridor planning method by combining the ball Said-Ball curve and a novel super eagle optimization algorithm (SEOA). Firstly, the ball security corridor planning model is established by taking the center curve and radius function of the ball Said-Ball (BSB) curve as the flight path and security boundary. It not only considers the smoothness of the flight path, but also reserves enough security range to avoid cumulative errors. Then, a novel super eagle optimization algorithm is proposed to solve the established model with higher accuracy and efficiency. It simulates the hunting process of virtual super eagles with intelligent thinking. For super eagles, two patterns are designed for determining prey at different stages to avoid premature convergence. An information sharing strategy is also introduced to balance the exploitation and exploration abilities. For prey, they can choose orderly and emergency strategies based on emotional function to escape capture to speed up the convergence of SEOA. According to the results of solving the test function in CEC2017, the SEOA has smaller average rank compared to other flying animal-based algorithms and recent popular algorithms. For the solving successful rate, the SEOA reaches 82.7586% and 89.6552%, respectively. Additionally, the results of Wilcoxon rank-sum test statistically prove that the SEOA is a newly developed intelligent optimization method with significantly higher accuracy. Finally, the SEOA is used to solve the established model by optimizing the positions and radii of control balls of BSB curves. Experimental results in three complex simulation scenes show that the flight corridors obtained by SEOA outperform those generated by other algorithms in overall fitness values. This indicates a more rational optimization in flight altitude, distance, smoothness, and security range. Its faster convergence speed can ensure higher efficiency in planning a security corridor satisfying constraints and requirements. \u00c2\u00a9 2024 Elsevier Ltd",

      "abstract": "Aiming at the six-rotor unmanned aerial vehicles subjected to false data injection attacks, an event-triggered-based distributed intelligent learning control strategy is proposed in this paper. The reinforcement learning algorithm which is designed based on neural networks is introduced to achieve intelligent optimal control. Under the actor-critic-identifier frame, three kinds of neural networks are used to realize the control action, evaluate the system performance, and estimate the unknown dynamic, respectively. Then, an improved event-triggered strategy including a decreasing function of the consensus error is designed to reduce the waste of resources while decreasing the adverse impact on tracking control performance as far as possible, which also does not exhibit Zeno behavior. Furthermore, an adaptive compensation control scheme is given, which can effectively compensate for the negative impacts brought by the false data injection attacks existing in information interaction among UAVs. Despite the impact of lumped disturbances and false data injection attacks, the proposed disturbance-observer-based distributed intelligent learning control strategy can still guarantee that all signals in the closed-loop unmanned aerial vehicle systems are bounded, and all follower unmanned aerial vehicles can track the signal of the leader unmanned aerial vehicle. Finally, some simulation verification diagrams are shown to test the feasibility of the designed control strategy. IEEE",

      "abstract": "Shark-human interactions are some of the most pervasive human-wildlife conflicts, and their frequencies are increasing globally. New South Wales (Australia) was the first to implement a broad-scale program of shark-bite mitigation in 1937 using shark nets, which expanded in the late 2010s to include non-lethal measures. Using 196 unprovoked shark-human interactions recorded in New South Wales since 1900, we show that bites shifted from being predominantly on swimmers to 79 % on surfers by the 1980s and increased 2\u00e2\u0080\u00934-fold. We could not detect differences in the interaction rate at netted versus non-netted beaches since the 2000s, partly because of low incidence and high variance. Although shark-human interactions continued to occur at beaches with tagged-shark listening stations, there were no interactions while SMART drumlines and/or drones were deployed. Our effect-size analyses show that a small increase in the difference between mitigated and non-mitigated beaches could indicate reductions in shark-human interactions. Area-based protection alone is insufficient to reduce shark-human interactions, so we propose a new, globally transferable approach to minimise risk of shark bite more effectively. \u00c2\u00a9 2023 The Authors",

      "abstract": "Ecosystem functions and services are severely threatened by unprecedented global loss in biodiversity. To counteract these trends, it is essential to develop systems to monitor changes in biodiversity for planning, evaluating, and implementing conservation and mitigation actions. However, the implementation of monitoring systems suffers from a trade-off between grain (i.e., the level of detail), extent (i.e., the number of study sites), and temporal repetition. Here, we present an applied and realized networked sensor system for integrated biodiversity monitoring in the Nature 4.0 project as a solution to these challenges, which considers plants and animals not only as targets of investigation, but also as parts of the modular sensor network by carrying sensors. Our networked sensor system consists of three main closely interlinked components with a modular structure: sensors, data transmission, and data storage, which are integrated into pipelines for automated biodiversity monitoring. We present our own real-world examples of applications, share our experiences in operating them, and provide our collected open data. Our flexible, low-cost, and open-source solutions can be applied for monitoring individual and multiple terrestrial plants and animals as well as their interactions. Ultimately, our system can also be applied to area-wide ecosystem mapping tasks, thereby providing an exemplary cost-efficient and powerful solution for biodiversity monitoring. Building upon our experiences in the Nature 4.0 project, we identified ten key challenges that need to be addressed to better understand and counteract the ongoing loss of biodiversity using networked sensor systems. To tackle these challenges, interdisciplinary collaboration, additional research, and practical solutions are necessary to enhance the capability and applicability of networked sensor systems for researchers and practitioners, ultimately further helping to ensure the sustainable management of ecosystems and the provision of ecosystem services. \u00c2\u00a9 2023 The Authors.

      "abstract": "Logistics drones are theoretically advantageous in automating last-mile delivery activities, but practically challenging in urban environments, including public concerns about risk of crashes and privacy. In view of the above concerns existing in the trajectory planning of logistics drones, this paper presents a parallel automatic delivery model following the cyber-physical social system (CPSS) for the last mile delivery of superchilling products, revealing the social value of logistics drone operations. Considering the operational constraints of logistics drone, a multi-objective optimisation model is established to balance the social value, energy efficiency and productivity of using logistics drones in the last-mile superchilling delivery. To effectively achieve the above optimisation, improved strategies, including the material exchange mechanism based on the random proportion rule and the Universe-Particle search strategy, are developed, resulting in an improved two-stage heuristic algorithm. Finally, simulation experiments are carried out in a simulated environment with 154 buildings, and compared with other frontier algorithms used for unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) trajectory planning. The results show that the proposed framework can effectively reduce the threats to public life safety and improve the energy efficiency of logistics drones, while ensuring the productivity in the delivery process. \u00c2\u00a9 2023 Elsevier Ltd",

Mobile health solutions can offer users instruments that can promote therapeutic adherence. The objective of this review is to investigate the impact mobile health systems have on therapeutic adherence. Specifically, we want to map the main systems used, the functions implemented, and the different methods of adherence detection used. For this purpose, a scoping review was conducted. The following databases were consulted: PubMed, Cochrane Library, EBSCO, including English-language studies published in the last 10 years (2012-2022). The main mobile health systems used are as follows: applications, automated messaging, interactive voice response, and mobile video games. The main features implemented to support medication management were as follows: reminders, self-monitoring instruments, educational support, and caregiver involvement. In conclusion, the use of interactive mobile health instruments intended for use by the patient and/or caregiver can improve objectively and subjectively detected therapeutic adherence. The use of these systems in the therapeutic pathway of users, with a special focus on people with comorbidities and in polypharmacy treatment, represents a challenge to improve caregiver health.

      "abstract": "For autonomous robots, it is desirable to learn coordination of primitive skills that can effectively solve long-horizon tasks and perform novel ones. Recent advances in hierarchical policy learning have shown that decomposing complex tasks into sequences of primitive skills which are called sketches can enable robots to perform directed exploration in challenging manipulation tasks. However, they usually fall short in sequencing skills in a new task without retraining as the task sketches are almost hard-coded or learned by deep reinforcement learning. To improve exploration efficiency for long-horizon tasks, we propose Sketch RL, a hierarchical framework that combines supervised learning with reinforcement learning interactively generates the task sketch, and utilizes it as the curriculum to guide low-level skill learning. Furthermore, to allow for multitask decomposition and generalizing few-shot to new tasks, our method exploits a Vision-based Skill Predictor (VSP) to capture shared subtask structure. Extensive experiments on challenging manipulation tasks demonstrate that Sketch RL substantially outperforms other prior baseline methods and is capable of adapting to new tasks with different sketches and real-world settings. \u00c2\u00a9 2016 IEEE.",

      "abstract": "This work presents an event-triggered mechanism-based distributed fractional-order fault-tolerant control (FTC) paradigm for multiple unmanned aerial vehicles (multi-UAVs) subject to full-state constraints. Distinct from the existing control solutions for multi-UAVs with constant constraints and symmetric constraints, the time-varying asymmetric constraints considered in this paper are more suitable for practical requirements. Neural networks are exploited to cope with uncertainties arising from unknown nonlinear dynamics. By cleverly combining speed functions with nonlinear state-dependent functions, a novel distributed FTC protocol is established to drive the system states into the boundary functions within a predetermined finite time. Simultaneously, fractional-order calculus is introduced to provide additional adjustment of control parameters, and an event-triggered mechanism is derived to reduce the update frequency of the control signal. It is testified that all signals of each follower UAV are semi-globally uniformly ultimately bounded, and all follower UAVs can follow the attitudes of the leader UAV. In the end, case studies are reported to corroborate the outperformance of the proposed methodology.",

In this work, we compare results obtained with a filament-based free wake panel method to experimental and previously validated numerical data. In particular, we study a propeller-wing configuration at zero angle of attack and the aerodynamics of the blade-resolved slipstream interaction with the wing. We use a prescribed wake on the wing and a free wake on the propeller, which greatly accelerate the computations. Results indicate that, while forces are overpredicted due to the inviscid nature of the panel method, the free wake is able to capture the slipstream deformation and shearing with remarkable success. We find that a filament-based free wake panel method can be a useful tool for propeller-wing interaction in preliminary aircraft design. \u00c2\u00a9 2023 The Author(s)",

      "abstract": "Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) are increasingly being deployed in crucial missions for the armed forces, law enforcement, industrial control monitoring, and other sectors. However, these hostile operating circumstances, along with the UAVs\u2019 dependence on wireless protocols, pose substantial security threats, limiting their mainstream application. With network security being such a major issue for UAV networks, the machine learning-based intrusion detection system (IDS) has been determined to be an effective strategy for protecting them. Additionally, though the existing methods offer effective strategies for detecting and categorizing abnormalities in the system, they are limited by their inability to adjust to various attack patterns. The dataset used as well as the memory and computational requirement of existing models, poses new challenges. One of the main concerns pertains to the reduced computational and memory demands of these models. So, the work carried out in this paper addresses this challenge. The work carried out in this paper addresses this challenge. A new dimensional reduction technique based on correlation coefficient, information gain, and principal component analysis (PCA) is introduced to reduce the dimensionality of the UAV Attack Dataset. A novel intrusion detection system based on an artificial neural network (ANN) and genetic algorithm (GA) is then proposed. The genetic algorithm is used to generate the optimal weights of the artificial neural network. A comparison is made between the proposed model and the backpropagation network and its variant in terms of its convergence and prediction accuracy. Furthermore, the performance of the proposed model is compared with that of other classifiers. This comparison reveals that the proposed model is time efficient with an increased prediction accuracy of at least 6% more than other classifiers. Authors",

      "abstract": "People with special needs can receive health care services in their own homes through the use of smart home systems. In essence, this type of smart home has specialized electronics that allow remote operation of automated remote health care gadgets, enabling patient security and health tracking. These sensors are linked to a local intelligence unit, which examines sensor data, detects emergencies, and serves as the patient\u2019s point of contact with various healthcare professionals such as doctors, paramedics, nurses, and emergency services. Smart homes can improve the patient\u2019s quality of life and security by creatively utilizing cutting-edge technologies. The use of smart homes is being driven by telemedicine and telecare. Telecare Medicine Information Systems (TMIS) were developed 20&nbsp;years ago and have increased in popularity on a global scale since then as current technology has enabled healthcare to be delivered remotely. Using upgraded network technologies, a new technological platform for TMIS for patients is provided. TMIS, on the other hand, is commonly targeted by various forms of attacks due to data transmission across an insecure channel. Several authentication techniques based on the chaotic map have recently been proposed. Many of these designs, however, are not resistant to the known attacks. Although some of the structures achieve low computation overhead, many of them are unable to guarantee forward secrecy and cannot establish an anonymous conversation. In order to improve security and efficiency, we provide an authentication and key agreement mechanism for TMIS in smart city environments in this study. Fractional chaotic theory assumptions underlie the security assumptions. With just two messages exchanged, a secure session can be started using this approach, which enables forward secrecy. In addition, we compare and contrast related authentication techniques.",

      "abstract": "Accurate robot kinematic modelling is a major component for autonomous robot control to guarantee safety and precision during task execution. In surgical robotics complex robotic structures and actuation mechanisms are generally employed, therefore machine learning techniques can be adopted to build the model of the robot. Probabilistic neural networks are a class of learning approaches that provide information about the uncertainty of the learnt models. In this work we compare two different probabilistic neural networks (Bayesian and Evidential Neural Networks) to model the kinematics of a surgical robotic instrument and propose a control strategy based on Hierarchical Quadratic Programming (HQP) capable of exploiting the model uncertainty to improve the accuracy and safety of the controller. Simulation and real world experiments on different autonomous path tracking tasks show that the model uncertainty highly affects the control performances and prove the effectiveness of the proposed controller in improving task execution. Note to Practitioners - The push towards reducing invasiveness and patient's traumas in surgery has lead to the requirement of miniaturized and highly articulated robots. This however comes at the cost of having systems that are hard to model and control, which is one of the major limitations for autonomy in surgical robotics. Machine learning has become very effective in modelling complex systems and probabilistic approaches additionally allow estimating the confidence of the learnt model. In robotics field where high precision is required to perform an autonomous task, like in minimally invasive surgery, the robot model needs to be very accurate and controllers need to guarantee safety in performing the desired task, while satisfying additional motion constraints imposed by the application scenario. This work proposes the use of probabilistic neural networks to model the complexity of a surgical robotic instrument and a control strategy capable of ensuring safety by maximizing model's confidence and guaranteeing satisfaction of imposed motion constraints. In this work a macro-micro manipulator setup is employed, consisting of an articulated surgical robotic instrument connected to a serial-link manipulator. The proposed modelling and control approaches can be used in any other field where controllers need to highly rely on the robot model due to limitations in using external sensors and where leveraging information about model's confidence can be beneficial. Currently, the work focuses only on pure kinematic modelling and control, thus neglecting any possible interaction with the environment. Future work will focus on addressing this limitation in order to ensure proper force control and effective autonomy. \u00c2\u00a9 2004-2012 IEEE.",

      "abstract": "The combined impacts of rapid urbanization and climate change pose significant threats to global biodiversity. To counter these threats, the establishment of appropriate habitats is becoming pivotal for species preservation. Due to positive ecological interventions, Baer\u2019s Pochard (Aythya baeri), a critically endangered avian species per the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) classification, has made a remarkable resurgence in the wetlands of Baiyangdian (BYD). BYD, located in Xiong\u2019an New Area, central North China, is the largest wetland and an ideal habitat for rare bird species. Our study focuses on identifying ideal habitats within BYD to further its conservation. To this end, unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV) integrated with GPS functionalities were utilized to collect occurrence data for the species. Furthermore, the Google Earth Engine (GEE) provided access to high-resolution, real-time satellite imagery. Our model exhibited substantial reliability, reflected by area under the curve (AUC) values of 0.917 and 0.934 for breeding and migration periods, respectively. During the breeding phase, the prime habitat for Baer\u2019s Pochard spans 162 km2, predominantly encompassing regions like Xiaobaiyangdian (XBYD), Zhaozadian (ZZD), Damaidian (DMD), and Shaochedian (SCD). Factors such as Distance to towns and Landcover predominantly influence breeding habitat selection. In the migration phase, ideal regions covered an expanse of 124 km2, highlighting areas like northern and eastern SCD, the northwestern side of Datian Village (DTV) and Beitian Village (BTV) Fuhe Wetland (FHW), and Xiaoyihe Wetland (XYHW). The predominant determinants for migration habitat are Distance to towns and Wetness. These insights offer a fundamental foundation for the conservation and management strategies of Baer\u2019s Pochard in BYD, presenting a roadmap for future conservation endeavors.",

      "abstract": "This paper reports on the use of co-simulation techniques to build prototypes of co-operative autonomous robotic cyber-physical systems. Designing such systems involves a mission-specific planner algorithm, a control algorithm to drive an agent performing its task; and the plant model to simulate the agent dynamics. An application aimed at positioning a swarm of unmanned aerial vehicles (drones) in a bounded area, exploiting a Voronoi tessellation algorithm developed in this work, is taken as a case study. The paper shows how co-simulation allows testing the complex system at the design phase using models created with different languages and tools. The paper then reports on how the adopted co-simulation platform enables control parameters calibration, by exploiting design space exploration technology. The INTO-CPS co-simulation platform, compliant with the Functional Mock-up Interface standard to exchange dynamic simulation models using various languages, was used in this work. The different software modules were written in Modelica, C, and Python. In particular, the latter was used to implement an original variant of the Voronoi algorithm to tesselate a convex polygonal region, by means of dummy points added at appropriate positions outside the bounding polygon. A key contribution of this case study is that it demonstrates how an accurate simulation of a cooperative drone swarm requires modeling the physical plant together with the high-level coordination algorithm. The coupling of co-simulation and design space exploration has been demonstrated to support control parameter calibration to optimize energy consumption and convergence time to the target positions of the drone swarm. From a practical point of view, this makes it possible to test the ability of the swarm to self-deploy in space in order to achieve optimal detection coverage and allow unmanned aerial vehicles in a swarm to coordinate with each other. \u00c2\u00a9 2023 The Authors.",

      "abstract": "Camouflaged people are extremely expert in actively concealing themselves by effectively utilizing cover and the surrounding environment. Despite advancements in optical detection capabilities through imaging systems, including spectral, polarization, and infrared technologies, there is still a lack of effective real-time method for accurately detecting small-size and high-efficient camouflaged people in complex real-world scenes. Here, this study proposes a snapshot multispectral image-based camouflaged detection model, multispectral YOLO (MS-YOLO), which utilizes the SPD-Conv and SimAM modules to effectively represent targets and suppress background interference by exploiting the spatial-spectral target information. Besides, the study constructs the first real-shot multispectral camouflaged people dataset (MSCPD), which encompasses diverse scenes, target scales, and attitudes. To minimize information redundancy, MS-YOLO selects an optimal subset of 12 bands with strong feature representation and minimal inter-band correlation as input. Through experiments on the MSCPD, MS-YOLO achieves a mean Average Precision of 94.31% and real-time detection at 65 frames per second, which confirms the effectiveness and efficiency of our method in detecting camouflaged people in various typical desert and forest scenes. Our approach offers valuable support to improve the perception capabilities of unmanned aerial vehicles in detecting enemy forces and rescuing personnel in battlefield. \u00c2\u00a9 2023 China Ordnance Society",

      "abstract": "This article addresses an autonomous manipulation problem for an underwater vehicle-manipulator system (UVMS) operating in a free-floating way while subjecting to unknown continuous disturbance. More specifically, a composite control scheme composed of disturbance observer (DOB), predictor model network (PM-Net), and nonlinear model predictive control (NMPC), is devised to improve the control performance of UVMS (i.e., unicycle-like UVMS actuated only in the surge, heave, and yaw for vehicle body) in the case of disturbance, model mismatch, and input saturation. A RBF-DOB is formulated by combining a DOB and a Radial Basis Function (RBF) neural network to estimate disturbance at the current step. Then, the PM-Network, composed of a disturbance predictor network and state predictor network, is developed based on long short-term memory (LSTM) network that predicts UVMS state sequences considering model mismatch and disturbance. The NMPC is deployed as a feedback control law to endow the input saturation of the UVMS and produce optimal control action. Compared with conventional DOB control methods using feed-forward compensation of disturbance, the primary merit of the proposed approach is that the disturbance estimated by RBF-DOB is utilized in the PM-Net to predict future UVMS state sequences, which are exploited on the NMPC's receding optimization. Finally, realistic simulation and relevant experiment are conducted to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method. Note to Practitioners - The motivation behind this article is the autonomous manipulation of an underwater vehicle-manipulator system subjected to unknown disturbance. However, it is not always feasible or straightforward to obtain the external disturbance and unmodeled dynamics for designing robust controllers. On the one hand, how to manipulate the disturbance into the designed controller to generate optimal control action rather than by using feed-forward compensation. On the other hand, the control input saturation often occurs in the UVMS control, especially under the disturbance rejection conditions, where it should be considered in the controller design. Currently, the predominant methods for UVMS control lack a control scheme that provides a complete and credible control strategy that takes the aforementioned issues into consideration. Motivated by the above analysis, this study provides a composite control scheme to deal with the dynamic uncertainties, unknown disturbance, and input saturation. The results of realistic simulation and relevant experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method. Hopefully, our control method can provide valuable theoretical and technical guidance to practicing marine engineers for controller design. \u00c2\u00a9 2004-2012 IEEE.",

      "abstract": "With the growing threat of unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) intrusions, the topic of anti-UAV tracking has received widespread attention from the community. Traditional Siamese trackers struggle with small UAV targets and are plagued by model degradation issues. To mitigate this, we propose a novel searching region-free and template-free Siamese network (SiamSRT) to track UAV targets in thermal infrared (TIR) videos. The proposed tracker builds a two-stage Siamese architecture with the former providing detection of the first-frame ground truth by using a cross-correlated region proposal network (C-C RPN) and the latter providing detection of previous-frame predictions via a similarity-learning region convolutional neural network (S-L RCNN). In both stage, global proposals are acquired by region of interest (ROI) alignment operation to break the limitation of searching region. Then, a spatial location consistency function is introduced to suppress background thermal distractors and a temporal memory bank (TMB) is utilized to avoid template update degradation problem. Further, a single-category foreground detector (SCFD) is designed to independently predict the position of the UAV target. SCFD can re-initialize the tracker without the given target in the first frame, which can help to recover the tracking failures. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that SiamSRT achieves the best performance compared to the most advanced algorithms in the anti-UAV tracking missions. \u00c2\u00a9 1980-2012 IEEE.",

Although major data protection regulations require apps to disclose their data practices transparently, previous studies have pointed out difficulties in doing so. To further delve into this issue, this article describes an automated method to capture data-sharing practices in Android apps and assess their proper disclosure according to the EU General Data Protection Regulation. We applied the method to 9,000 random Android apps, unveiling an uncomfortable reality: over 80% of Android applications that transfer personal data off device potentially fail to meet GDPR transparency requirements.

      "abstract": "After researchers devoted considerable efforts to developing 5G standards, their passion began to focus on establishing the basics for the standardization of 6G and beyond. The utilization of millimeter wave (MMW) and terahertz (THz) frequency bands, combined with sensors and artificial intelligence (AI), has gained significant attention in the research community for the development of the next generation of sensory and radio access networks (NG-SRANs). Leveraging the advantages of communication and sensor systems' common characteristics will open horizons for merging the two networks, thereby creating a unified perceptive and intelligence network. Overall, while using MMW and THz frequencies is certainly valuable, the ability to gather and transmit data in real-time makes sensors extremely effective in communication networks. In contrast, AI, machine learning (ML), and deep learning (DL) have become predominant methods for solving data analysis problems across a wide range of domains, such as analyzing large amounts of different sensor data, decision-making, channel estimation, self-organization, and self-healing. This paper proposes a novel design for a potential 6G network and beyond called the Hydra radio access network (H-RAN) perceptual networks architecture, which is designed based on NG-SRAN. From a design perspective, H-RAN aims to merge communication and sensing networks into a single network in which two functionalities are attempted to mutually complement each other, namely communication-aided sensing and sensing-aided communications networks. However, such a network provides an adequate platform for a wide range of AL/ML algorithms, such as real-time decision-making, self-organization, and self-healing. As a result, H-RAN perceptual networks architecture is expected to be more efficient, reliable, and secure than existing conventional networks, and is likely to play a critical role in a wide range of applications, including but not limited to mobile broadband, sensing systems, smart cities, autonomous vehicles, the internet of things (IoT) connectivity, vehicle-to-everything (V2X) communication, etc. This study gives a detailed overview of how H-RAN will revolutionize conventional future sensors and cellular networks through a comprehensive analysis of H-RAN architectural components and functionalities. \u00c2\u00a9 2013 IEEE.",

      "abstract": "Annatto, a globally valued crop, has multifaceted applications ranging from food coloring to medicine. While adaptable, its productivity is influenced by climate, making it vulnerable to global warming. This study investigates the agroclimatic suitability for annatto cultivation in Brazil, considering current and projected climate scenarios, highlighting potential impacts on agriculture, the economy, and environmental sustainability. This study aims to carry out the annatto (Bixa orellana L.) agroclimatic zoning for Brazil in the current scenario and the SSP5-8.5 climate change scenario for CMIP6. Air temperature and daily precipitation data for the 1970\u20132000 and for 2021\u20132100 for the IPSL-CM6A-LR model the SSP1-2.6, SSP2-4.5, SSP3-2.6 and SSP5-8.5 in GeoTIFF format. This study was carried out for the entire Brazilian territory. Future climate variables were obtained by the WorldClim 2.1 platform for the IPSL-CM6A-LR model in the periods 2021\u20132100 and the SSP1-2.6, SSP2-4.5, SSP3-2.6 and SSP5-8.5 scenario. Thus, zoning was carried out using geographic information systems software (QGIS), automated with the Python language. The annatto climate zoning for the current scenario showed five classes. The most predominant class was restricted due to excess water (42.9%), followed by the suitable class (32.5%), standing out the central Brazilian region: Mato Grosso do Sul (91.6%), Goi\u00e1s (80.8%), and Tocantins (92.6%). Climate change affected negatively annatto climate zoning in all scenarios. The suitability class for the SSP5-8.5 scenario decreased in all periods, with means of 27.9% (2021\u20132040), 20.2% (2041\u20132060), 12.1% (2061\u20132080), and 6.5% (2081\u20132100). Climate changes significantly impact annatto cultivation areas in Brazil, particularly by 2081\u20132100, with a notable reduction in suitable zones. Key producing regions, like Monte Castelo-SP and Dracena-SP, face unsuitability, threatening local economies. The study underscores the urgency to explore annatto's adaptive capacity against the direst IPCC scenario (SSP5-8.5).",

Thus, the development of alternative approaches to remediate this environmental threat is urgently needed. Microrobots, combining autonomous motion with great tunability for the development of specific tasks, have turned into promising candidates to take on the challenge. Here, hybrid urchin-like hematite (\u00ce\u00b1-Fe2O3) microparticles carrying magnetite (Fe3O4) nanoparticles and surface functionalization with organic \u00ce\u00b2-cyclodextrin (CD) molecules are prepared with the aim of on-the-fly encapsulation of illicit drugs into the linked CD cavities of moving microrobots. The resulting mag-CD microrobots are tested against methamphetamine (MA), proving their ability for the removal of this psychoactive substance. A dramatically enhanced capture of MA from water with active magnetically powered microrobots when compared with static passive CD-modified particles is demonstrated. This work shows the advantages of enhanced mass transfer provided by the externally controlled magnetic navigation in microrobots that together with the versatility of their design is an efficient strategy to clean polluted waters. \u00c2\u00a9 2024 The Authors.

Firstly, an adaptive memory-based event-triggering communication mechanism (METCM) is designed to save networked resources in maritime environment. Second, the signals released by the communication mechanism are quantized to further reduce the bandwidth of the communication network. In addition, since adversary may have multiple attack strategies, thus a hierarchical semi-Markov process (HS-MP) is presented to capture the phenomenon of switching DoS attacks, which makes the attack model more realistic. Further, sufficient conditions are proposed for the finite-time boundedness (FTB) of the UMV system and some linear matrix inequalities are solved to determine the finite-time bounded controller gain. Finally, the effectiveness of the proposed control method is demonstrated by a simulation example. IEEE",

Unlike well-defined DRAPs, the disturbed second-order agents are taken into account. Moreover, all agents' decisions are subject to both coupling and local inequalities. Because of the coexistence of disturbed second-order nonlinear dynamics and inequality constraints, existing strategies are not applicable to tackle our problem. Also, they create challenges for the strategy design, because the inequality constraints must hold at the optimal allocation (OA), while these agents are not able to control their decisions directly. By gradient descent, state feedback and internal model (IM), we exploit a distributed strategy to control all agents to carry out the distributed resource allocation tasks (DRATs). Furthermore, the strategy is rigorously analyzed. Finally, our strategy is applied to the economic dispatch problems (EDPs). Under our approach, turbine-generators can autonomously achieve the optimal generation allocation by regulating their powers, in accordance with the load demand of smart grids. \u00c2\u00a9 2023 Elsevier Inc.",

      "abstract": "This paper investigates a reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS)-assisted unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV)-enabled wireless powered communication network (WPCN). In the system, a UAV acts as a hybrid access point (HAP) to charge users in the downlink (DL) and receive messages in the uplink (UL). In particular, the RIS is exploited to significantly enhance the efficiency of both the DL and UL transmission. Our objective is to enhance the minimum throughput among all ground users by jointly optimizing the horizontal location of UAVs, the transmit power of users, transmission time allocation, and passive beamforming vectors at the RIS. To address this problem, we present an alternating optimization-based algorithm with low complexity to decompose the problem into four subproblems and solve them sequentially. In particular, we derive a lower bound of the composite channel gain to tighten the constraints and employ successive convex approximation (SCA) to optimize the horizontal location of the UAV. The transmit power closed-form optimum solutions are then obtained, and the problem of time allocation is reformulated as a linear programming problem. Finally, we optimize the passive beamforming vectors by adopting semi-definite relaxation (SDR). The effectiveness of the algorithm is supported by numerical results, which also demonstrate that the RIS-assisted UAV-enabled WPCN outperforms the traditional WPCN in terms of the minimum throughput.

In this article, we employ an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) as an edge server to assist IIoT data processing, while considering the practical issue of UAV jittering. Specifically, we propose a joint design on trajectory and offloading strategies to minimize energy consumption due to local and edge computation, as well as data transmission. We particularly address UAV jittering that induces Gaussian-distributed uncertainties associated with flying waypoints, resulting in probabilistic-form flying speed and data offloading constraints. We exploit the Bernstein-type inequality to reformulate the constraints in deterministic forms and decompose the energy minimization to solve for trajectory and offloading separately within an alternating optimization framework. The subproblems are then tackled with the successive convex approximation technique. Simulation results show that our proposal strictly guarantees robustness under uncertainties and effectively reduces energy consumption as compared with the baselines. \u00c2\u00a9 2005-2012 IEEE.",

      "abstract": "Federated Learning (FL) is a decentralized machine learning (ML) technique that allows a number of participants to train an ML model collaboratively without having to share their private local datasets with others. When participants are unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), UAV-enabled FL would experience heterogeneity due to the majorly skewed (non-independent and identically distributed -IID) collected data. In addition, UAVs may demonstrate unintentional misbehavior in which the latter may fail to send updates to the FL server due, for instance, to UAVs' disconnectivity from the FL system caused by high mobility, unavailability, or battery depletion. Such challenges may significantly affect the convergence of the FL model. A recent way to tackle these challenges is client selection, based on customized criteria that consider UAV computing power and energy consumption. However, most existing client selection schemes neglected the participants' reliability. Indeed, FL can be targeted by poisoning attacks, in which malicious UAVs upload poisonous local models to the FL server, by either providing targeted false predictions for specifically chosen inputs or by compromising the global model's accuracy through tampering with the local model. Hence, we propose in this article a novel client selection scheme that enhances convergence by prioritizing fast UAVs with high-reliability scores, while eliminating malicious UAVs from training. Through experiments, we assess the effectiveness of our scheme in resisting different attack scenarios, in terms of convergence and achieved model accuracy. Finally, we demonstrate the performance superiority of the proposed approach compared to baseline methods. \u00c2\u00a9 2020 IEEE.",

However, path energy consumption-based UUV hull design requires a tremendous amount of calculation due to the frequent changes in relative velocity and attack angle between a UUV and ocean current. In order to address this issue, this work developed a data-driven design methodology for energy consumption-based UUV hull design using artificial intelligence-aided design (AIAD). The design methodology in this work combined a deep learning (DL) algorithm that predicts UUVs' resistance with different hull shapes under different velocities and attack angles with the particle swarm optimization (PSO) algorithm for UUV hull design. We tested the proposed methodology in a path energy consumption-based experiment, where the optimized UUV hull showed an 8.8% reduction in path energy consumption compared with the initial UUV hull, and design costs were greatly reduced compared with the traditional computational fluid dynamics (CFD)-based methodology. Our work demonstrates that AIAD has the potential to solve UUV design problems previously thought to be too complex by offering a data-driven engineering shape (body surface) design method. \u00c2\u00a9 2023 by ASME.",

      "abstract": "Ground Penetrating Radar (GPR) systems on board Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) have been successfully used for subsurface imaging applications. Their capability to detect buried targets avoiding the contact with the soil turn these systems into a great solution to detect buried threats, such as landmines and Improvised Explosive Devices (IEDs). Significant advances have been also conducted to enhance the detection capabilities of these systems, complementing the Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) processing methods with several clutter mitigation techniques. However, the improvement in the scanning throughput (i.e., increasing the inspected area in a given time) remains a significant challenge. In this regard, this article compares several scanning strategies for UAV-mounted multichannel GPR-SAR systems using antenna arrays. In particular, two different scanning strategies have been compared: a uniform scheme and a non-uniform strategy called 3X. In addition, different across-track spacing values to generate dense and sparse sampling distributions were considered for each scanning scheme. After conducting a theoretical analysis of these strategies, they have been experimentally validated with measurements gathered with a portable scanner and during flights in realistic scenarios. Results show that the dense configurations of both scanning strategies yield good quality images of buried targets while improving the scanning throughput (compared to a single-channel architecture). In particular, the dense uniform scheme (with a 20 cm across-track spacing) achieves a greater reduction in the inspection time, compared to the dense 3X strategy, at the expense of a slightly smaller signal to clutter ratio.

      "abstract": "Advanced Driver Assistance Systems (ADAS) are advanced technologies that assist drivers with vehicle operation and navigation. Recent improvements and brisk expansion in the ADAS market, as well as an increase in the frequency of incidents such as sensor spoofing, communication interruption etc., in autonomous vehicles (AVs), have raised the need to research ADAS security technology. The security issues raised by incorporating these technologies into automobiles must be addressed to protect the privacy and safety of passengers and other road users. As a result, the purpose of this research is to investigate the security issues that arise from the integration of ADAS technologies. Addressing these challenges holds the potential to establish a foundation for enhanced safety and dependability within transportation networks amidst the ongoing advancements in vehicle technology. This paper starts by describing the vulnerabilities, threats, assaults, and defense mechanisms of the ADAS. It then delves into the attacks and countermeasures in three categories, namely VANET, Hardware, and Adversarial attacks. VANET attacks encompass threats targeting Vehicular Ad Hoc Networks, aiming to disrupt communication among vehicles or between vehicles and infrastructure. Hardware attacks focus on vulnerabilities within the physical components of ADAS, including sensors, processors, or communication modules. Adversarial attacks involve deliberate manipulations or perturbations introduced into machine learning models or algorithms utilized within ADAS. These attacks aim to deceive or undermine the functionality of AI-based systems, causing misclassification, compromising system integrity, and posing risks to user safety by exploiting vulnerabilities in the AI decision-making process. Finally, this study highlights potential areas for future research, such as the utilization of artificial intelligence (AI), the necessity of industry-wide standardization, and recommends specific future work tailored to each attack described in the corresponding sections. \u00c2\u00a9 2023 The Authors.",

      "abstract": "The strain clamps and leading wires are important components that connect conductors on overhead transmission lines and conduct current. During operation, poor contact between these components can cause abnormal overheating, leading to electric failures and threatening power system reliability. Recently, the use of unmanned aerial vehicles equipped with infrared thermal imagers for strain clamp and leading wire maintenance has become increasingly popular. Deep learning-based image recognition shows promising prospects for intelligent fault diagnosis of overheating faults. A pre-treatment method is proposed based on dynamic histogram equalisation to enhance the contrast of infrared images. The DeepLab v3+ network, loss function, and existing networks with different backbones are compared. The DeepLab v3+ network with ResNet101 and convolutional block attention module added, and the Focal Loss function achieved the highest performance with an average pixel accuracy of 0.614, an average intersection over union (AIoU) of 0.567, an F1 score of 0.644, and a frequency weighted intersection over union of 0.594 on the test set. The optimised Atrous rates has increased the AIoU by 12.91%. Moreover, an intelligent diagnosis scheme for evaluating the defect state of the strain clamps and leading wires is proposed and which achieves a diagnostic accuracy of 91.0%. \u00c2\u00a9 2024 The Authors.

      "abstract": "Along with the ubiquity of various Internet of things (IoT) applications, data collection in harsh environments with the help of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) and unmanned surface vehicles (USVs) appears as a popular approach. However, from a networking and transmission perspective, how unmanned vehicles collaborate with each other and with end IoT devices as well as the propagation characteristics for such data transmissions are less exploited. In this paper, we develop a long-range wide-area network (LoRaWAN)-based data collection framework which enables UAV and/or USV assisted data acquisition in harsh environments. Within this framework, end devices are placed in hard-to-reach locations and data acquisition is performed in an on-demand manner by unmanned vehicles acting as a gateway or peer for end devices. The framework also includes a step-by-step procedure for data collection and analytics, from parameter configuration to model validation. To reveal the transmission characteristics, we identify three scenarios in a mountainous region in Romania and perform extensive real-life measurements for data collection. Based on the collected datasets, we develop four propagation models and demonstrate that our empirical models outperform the theoretical reference models. Based on the developed empirical models, the coverage of LoRaWAN for any spreading factor can be estimated with high precision. IEEE",

      "abstract": "Objectives: Patients who have recently suffered a transient ischemic attack (TIA) or minor ischemic stroke are at increased risk of cognitive impairment. In the present study, we aimed to investigate the effect of a 1-year exercise intervention on cognitive functioning up to 2 years post intervention. Material and methods: We conducted a single-blind randomized controlled trial to investigate the effect of an exercise intervention on cognitive functioning, compared with usual care, for up to 2 years. Patients with a TIA or minor stroke were randomly allocated to an intervention group receiving the 1-year exercise intervention (n = 60) or to usual care (n = 59). Outcome measures were assessed at baseline and after 1 and 2 years. We measured cognition with neuropsychological tests on three domains: (1) executive functioning, (2) attention-psychomotor speed, and (3) memory. Linear mixed models were used for longitudinal data to determine the effect of the exercise intervention on cognitive functioning. Statistical analyses were performed using IBM SPSS software 24.0. Results: We found that over the two years study period \u00e2\u0080\u0093and corrected for age, sex, and educational level\u00e2\u0080\u0093 the intervention group on average improved significantly more in executive functioning than the control group (\u00ce\u00b2 = 0.13; 95 % CI [0.02 to 0.25]; p = 0.03). No significant intervention effects were found on either memory or attention-psychomotor speed. Conclusions: Our data show that a 1-year exercise intervention significantly improved executive functioning over time, compared to usual care. We recommend that health care professionals consider broadening standard secondary stroke prevention treatment in patients with TIA/minor stroke by adding exercise and physical activity. \u00c2\u00a9 2023 Elsevier Inc.",

Multi-USVs with rudder angle fault and DoS attack modeling are first established. Then, the decentralized unknown input observer (UIO)-based fault estimation and distributed secure control approach is developed in a co-designed framework for multi-USVs with cyber\u2013physical threats. Advantages of the proposed secure scheme are: 1) actuator faults, DoS attacks, and event-triggering strategies with varying action instants, durations, and locations are synchronously addressed and 2) the criteria of exponential consensus are derived by virtue of attack frequency and average dwelling time technique without prior knowledge of unknown wave-induced perturbation bounds and elimination of Zeno behavior in an event-based mechanism. Comparative simulations outline the performance and advantage of the proposed distributed secure control algorithm. IEEE",

      "abstract": "Industrial robots are becoming increasingly vulnerable to cyber incidents and attacks, particularly with the dawn of the Industrial Internet-of-Things (IIoT). To gain a comprehensive understanding of these cyber risks, vulnerabilities of industrial robots were analyzed empirically, using more than three million communication packets collected with testbeds of two ABB IRB120 robots and five other robots from various Original Equipment Manufacturers (OEMs). This analysis, guided by the confidentiality\u00e2\u0080\u0093integrity\u00e2\u0080\u0093availability (CIA) triad, uncovers robot vulnerabilities in three dimensions: confidentiality, integrity, and availability. These vulnerabilities were used to design Covering Robot Manipulation via Data Deception (CORMAND2), an automated cyber\u00e2\u0080\u0093physical attack against industrial robots. CORMAND2 manipulates robot operation while deceiving the Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition (SCADA) system that the robot is operating normally by modifying the robot's movement data and data deception. CORMAND2 and its capability of degrading the manufacturing was validated experimentally using the aforementioned seven robots from six different OEMs. CORMAND2 unveils the limitations of existing anomaly detection systems, more specifically the assumption of the authenticity of SCADA-received movement data, to which we propose mitigations for. \u00c2\u00a9 2023",

      "abstract": "Gls UUV is an intelligent underwater platform that can operate autonomously. However, it is difficult for unmanned underwater vehicle (UUV) to make correct decisions timely and independently in the face of uncertain events. Therefore, it is necessary to assess the threat of uncertain events and guide UUV to make timely and accurate decisions. This article studies the threat assessment strategy of a human-in-the-loop UUV under uncertain events. First, the uncertain events are classified according to their characteristics, and the Bayesian network (BN) is constructed by taking the characteristic variables of uncertain events as neurons. Then, the human experiences are combined with the genetic optimization algorithm to determine the BN parameters. According to the reasoning of the BN, the threat of uncertain events is evaluated. Finally, according to the threat assessment results, the PSO and A/B model are used to replan the task. The proposed algorithm uses BN to represent uncertain events and introduces human experiences to optimize network parameters, eliminating subjective bias and improving the accuracy of threat assessment. At the same time, the task replanning strategy is introduced to ensure the security of UUV. Four typical UUV tasks are designed, and the trigger elements of uncertain events are set in the simulation to verify the performance of the proposed algorithm. The simulation and experiment results show that a UUV can accurately assess the threat level of uncertain events during the task execution process when using the proposed strategy. The safety of the human-in-the-loop UUV operation is guaranteed by task replanning. \u00c2\u00a9 2013 IEEE.",

      "abstract": "Unmanned transportation in construction scenarios presents a significant challenge due to the presence of complex dynamic on-ground obstacles and potential airborne falling objects. Consequently, the typical methodology for composite air\u2013ground risk avoidance in construction scenarios holds enormous importance. In this paper, an integrated potential-field-based risk assessment approach is proposed to evaluate the threat severity of the environmental obstacles. Meanwhile, the self-adaptive dynamic window approach is suggested to manage the real-time motion planning solution for air\u2013ground risks. By designing the multi-objective velocity sample window, we constrain the vehicle\u2019s speed planning instructions within reasonable limits. Combined with a hierarchical decision-making mechanism, this approach achieves effective obstacle avoidance with multiple drive modes. Simulation results demonstrate that, in comparison with the traditional dynamic window approach, the proposed method offers enhanced stability and efficiency in risk avoidance, underlining its notable safety and effectiveness.",

      "abstract": "Localizing targets outside the anchors' convex hull is an understudied but prevalent scenario in vehicle-centric, UAV-based, and self-localization applications. Considering such scenarios, this paper studies the optimal anchor placement problem for Time-of-Arrival (ToA)-based localization schemes such that the <italic>worst-case Dilution of Precision (DOP)</italic> is minimized. Building on prior results on DOP scaling laws for beyond convex hull ToA-based localization, we propose a novel metric termed the <italic>Range-Normalized DOP (RNDOP)</italic>. We show that the worst-case DOP-optimal anchor placement problem simplifies to a min-max RNDOP-optimal anchor placement problem. Unfortunately, this formulation results in a non-convex and intractable problem under realistic constraints. To overcome this, we propose iterative anchor addition schemes, which result in a tractable albeit non-convex problem. By exploiting the structure arising from the resultant rank-1 update, we devise three heuristic schemes with varying performance-complexity tradeoffs. In addition, we also derive the upper and lower bounds for scenarios where we are placing anchors to optimize the worst-case (a) 3D positioning error and (b) 2D positioning error. We build on these results to design a cohesive iterative algorithmic framework for robust anchor placement, characterize the impact of anchor position uncertainty, and then discuss the computational complexity of the proposed schemes. Using numerical results, we validate the accuracy of our theoretical results. We also present comprehensive Monte-Carlo simulation results to compare the positioning error and execution time performance of each iterative scheme, discuss the tradeoffs, and provide valuable system design insights for beyond convex hull localization scenarios.

      "abstract": "Autonomous vehicles must be comprehensively evaluated before deployed in cities and highways. However, most existing evaluation approaches for autonomous vehicles are static and model environmental vehicles with predefined trajectories, which ignore the time-sequential interactions between the ego vehicle and environmental vehicles. In this paper, we propose a dynamic test scenario generation method to evaluate autonomous vehicles by modeling environmental vehicles as agents with human behavior and simulating the interaction process between the autonomous vehicle and environmental vehicles. Considering the multimodal features of traffic scenarios, we cluster the real-word traffic environments, and integrate the scenario class labels into the conditional generative adversarial imitation learning (CGAIL) model to generate different types of traffic scenarios. The proposed method is validated in a typical lane-change scenario that involves frequent interactions between ego vehicle and environmental vehicles. Results show that the proposed method further test autonomous vehicles\u00e2\u0080\u0099 ability to cope with dynamic scenarios, and can be used to infer the weaknesses of the tested vehicles. \u00c2\u00a9 2023 Elsevier Ltd",

Equally important is the study of post-fire damages, specifically burnt areas, which can provide valuable insights. This research focuses on the detection and classification of burnt areas and their severity using RGB and multispectral aerial imagery captured by an unmanned aerial vehicle. Datasets containing features computed from multispectral and/or RGB imagery were generated and used to train and optimize support vector machine (SVM) and random forest (RF) models. Hyperparameter tuning was performed to identify the best parameters for a pixel-based classification. The findings demonstrate the superiority of multispectral data for burnt area and burn severity classification with both RF and SVM models. While the RF model achieved a 95.5% overall accuracy for the burnt area classification using RGB data, the RGB models encountered challenges in distinguishing between mildly and severely burnt classes in the burn severity classification. However, the RF model incorporating mixed data (RGB and multispectral) achieved the highest accuracy of 96.59%. The outcomes of this study contribute to the understanding and practical implementation of machine learning techniques for assessing and managing burnt areas.",

      "abstract": "On October 11 and November 3, 2018, two large landslides occurred at the same location in Baige Village, eastern Tibet, China. These landslides pose a serious threat to both upstream and downstream areas, raising great concerns in China and worldwide. Currently, the influencing factors and fundamental mechanism of the Baige landslide are questioned, and further research is needed. Multiple methods, including comprehensive field investigation, satellite remote sensing, unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) 3D imaging, and geographical information systems, are used to analyze the main characteristics, influencing factors, and fundamental mechanism of the Baige landslide. The results reveal that the occurrence of the Baige landslide is closely related to deep-seated gravitational slope deformations (DSGSDs); tectonic activity, river incision, earthquakes, and rainfall are also responsible for the formation of the event. From a long-term perspective, DSGSDs, active tectonic deformation, repetitive seismic activities, rapid river incision, and sustained rainfall infiltration all interact with each other and finally trigger catastrophic landslides. The damage deformation process of the Baige landslide can be divided into three stages: epigenetic deformation, time-dependent deformation, and failure. Some unstable rock masses still exist in the source area, and thus, successive deformation monitoring and timely mitigation measures should be implemented to reduce the residual risks. The research in this paper is meaningful for further research on such large-scale landslides along the Jinsha River.",

      "abstract": "This article addresses indoor environment mapping by employing the synthetic aperture radar (SAR) technique at millimeter wave (mmWave) frequencies. The mmWave-based SAR can provide a high-resolution map, for example, of an emergency scenario like a burning room. The high-resolution map drives a new era of SAR applications such as object detection, classification, characterization, and precise localization. A major requirement at high frequencies is the precise knowledge of SAR trajectory, where radar sensors are mounted on a mobile platform such as a drone or unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV). State-of-the-art localization methods such as global positioning system (GPS)-aided inertial measurement units (IMUs) are not valid due to limited coverage and accuracy. One of the primary solutions could be the SAR assisted with an indoor localization system, which is exploited in the work. The presented indoor localization system comprises two types of passive chipless frequency-coded tags, based on dielectric resonators (DRs) and frequency-selective surfaces. In this work, first, the proposed method of integrating SAR and localization systems is evaluated in a single-tag environment. Further, a version of a room equipped with a multitag system is considered for real-time applications, and a successful demonstration of indoor environment mapping for the frequency spectrum of 75-110 GHz is presented. \u00c2\u00a9 2001-2012 IEEE.",

However, there remains a compelling challenge that the models trained with training data may not generalize well in practical applications due to the various marine conditions/working devices. This article proposes a real-time cross-domain segmentation adaptation scheme for SSS images based on adversarial training via min-max training to distribute SSS images in the output space and marginal distribution adaption to improve the segmentation performance by minimizing the measured distribution distance. To further enhance the adapted model, the multilayer feature discriminators are established to realize the fine-grained alignment. Experiments on the real-world SSS datasets demonstrate that our proposed model outperforms state-of-the-art methods and achieves the actual industrial application for AUV. \u00c2\u00a9 1982-2012 IEEE.",

      "abstract": "An offline and online bi-level structure-based dynamic path planning algorithm is proposed for an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) in low-altitude complex urban environment. First, an improved Hunger Games Search (HGS) algorithm is developed to generate an offline optimized path under the UAV\u00e2\u0080\u0099s performance constraints and the known static obstacles\u00e2\u0080\u0099 constraints. The individuals of the proposed algorithm will be divided into multiple groups to increase the population diversity. And then, a dynamic grouping strategy and a quantum-behaved behavior are proposed to solve the premature convergence\u00e2\u0080\u0099s problem and the imbalance problem between exploration and exploitation ability in HGS. To improve the dynamic obstacle avoidance efficiency of the algorithm, the dynamic obstacles are classified into three categories: newly added no-fly zone, known and unknown dynamic obstacles. Then, utilizing the information of the offline optimized path and the airborne sensors, three kinds of online planning strategies\u00e2\u0080\u0094an improved rapid-exploring random tree (RRT), a changing speed strategy, and a novel three-dimensional rolling windows\u00e2\u0080\u0094are introduced to dynamically update the path or speed of the UAV. Simulation results indicated that the improved HGS can enhance the performances of the traditional HGS and outperform other compared algorithms on the benchmark functions. Meanwhile, the online planning strategies can effectively achieve dynamic obstacle avoidance within the constraints of offline path. More specially, the planning time and angles of the local path to avoid the no-fly-zone\u00e2\u0080\u0099s influence are improved by 11.3% and 56.8% through utilizing the improved RRT. \u00c2\u00a9 The Author(s) 2023.",

Nevertheless, the use of FFF for aerospace and aeronautical applications is often impeded by the inadequate surface finish it imparts to the produced components. This work aims to demonstrate that, with careful calibration of process parameters and build orientation, FFF can produce aerospace components with low surface roughness. This could enable FFF to be used in aeronautics, allowing the benefits of lightweighting structures using metal replacement thermoplastics and variable infill to be exploited. In this study, rudder sections of a UAV tailplane were produced using FFF and lightened through variable internal infills, thin thicknesses, and a polymer for metal replacement. By setting different printing processes, such as infill percentage and orientation, a configuration with 10% of linear infill which results in a 97.5 g component was identified that exhibits suitable surface roughness for aerospace applications and a weight saving of approximately 50% compared to an equivalent metal volume.",

      "abstract": "Background: Red blood cell (RBC) transfusion remains a major treatment for sickle cell disease (SCD). Patients with SCD have a high prevalence of renal impairment and cardiorespiratory disease, conferring risk of transfusion-associated circulatory overload (TACO). Study Design and Methods: We describe an approach, titled euvolemic automated transfusion (EAT), to transfuse SCD patients with severe anemia who are at risk of TACO. In EAT, plasmapheresis is performed using donor RBCs, rather than albumin or plasma, as replacement fluid. Euvolemia is maintained. A retrospective analysis was conducted of patients with SCD who underwent EAT at our institution over a 10-year period, to evaluate the efficacy and safety of EAT. Results: Eleven SCD patients underwent 109 EAT procedures (1\u00e2\u0080\u009359 procedures per patient). The median age was 42 years (IQR = [30\u00e2\u0080\u009349]) and 82% (n = 9) were female. Most (82%; n = 9) patients had severe chronic kidney disease and 55% (n = 6) had heart failure. One (9%) patient had a history of life-threatening TACO. Mean pre- and post-procedure Hct values were 19.8% (SD \u00c2\u00b1 1.6%) and 29.1% (SD \u00c2\u00b1 1.4%), respectively. The average Hct increment was 3.2% per RBC unit. Only two EAT-related complications were recorded during the 109 procedures: central line-associated infection and citrate toxicity (muscle cramping). EAT used an average of two RBC units less than that projected for standard automated RBC exchange. Conclusion: Our findings suggest that EAT is safe and effective to treat patients with SCD and severe anemia, who are at risk for TACO. EAT requires fewer RBC units compared to automated RBC exchange. \u00c2\u00a9 2023 AABB.",

      "abstract": "Smart cameras are an essential component in surveillance and monitoring applications, and they have been typically deployed in networks of fixed camera locations. The addition of mobile cameras, mounted on robots, can overcome some of the limitations of static networks such as blind spots or back-lightning, allowing the system to gather the best information at each time by active positioning. This work presents a hybrid camera system, with static and mobile cameras, where all the cameras collaborate to observe people moving freely in the environment and efficiently visualize certain attributes from each person. Our solution combines a multi-camera distributed tracking system, to localize with precision all the people, with a control scheme that moves the mobile cameras to the best viewpoints for a specific classification task. The main contribution of this paper is a novel framework that exploits the synergies that result from the cooperation of the tracking and the control modules, obtaining a system closer to the real-world application and capable of high-level scene understanding. The static camera network provides global awareness of the control scheme to move the robots. In exchange, the mobile cameras onboard the robots provide enhanced information about the people on the scene. We perform a thorough analysis of the people monitoring application performance under different conditions thanks to the use of a photo-realistic simulation environment. Our experiments demonstrate the benefits of collaborative mobile cameras with respect to static or individual camera setups. \u00c2\u00a9 2023 The Authors",

      "abstract": "Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) represent an essential component of advanced intelligent equipment that can be used as an aerial perception system by installing various sensors such as vision, hearing, touch, taste, and smell to achieve intelligently integrated perception of environments. However, these perception system with environmental information may be threatened by various internal and external attacks, causing a great challenge to the security of the UAV. The original security system relied on an expert knowledge base to prevent attacks, but the weaknesses of lacking proactivity and flexibility are gradually exposed. The strong resistance and survivability of biological systems can be used to fill this capability gap and provide new ideas for the security of the UAV perception system. Therefore, an endogenous security framework (ESUAV-NI) based on the neural system and immune system is proposed in this article. Through breeding artificial intelligence (AI) vaccines and distributed neural hierarchical control, we achieve the security protection for the UAV perception system. Moreover, we evaluated the AI vaccine breeding approach in the ESUAV-NI by conducting extensive experiments on internal threats and external aerial imagery camouflage data, respectively. The results show that the proposed approach has a superior performance for the UAV perception system. \u00c2\u00a9 2005-2012 IEEE.",

      "abstract": "Suction cups are an important gripper type in industrial robot applications, and the prior literature focuses on using vision-based planners to improve grasping success in these tasks. Vision-based planners can fail due to adversarial objects or lose generalizability for unseen scenarios, without retraining learned algorithms. In this article, we propose haptic exploration to improve suction cup grasping when visual grasp planners fail. We present the smart suction cup, an end effector that utilizes internal flow measurements for tactile sensing. We show that model-based haptic search methods, guided by these flow measurements, improve grasping success by up to 2.5\u00c3\u0097 as compared with using only a vision planner during a bin-picking task. In characterizing the smart suction cup on both geometric edges and curves, we find that flow rate can accurately predict the ideal motion direction even with large postural errors. The smart suction cup includes no electronics on the cup itself, such that the design is easy to fabricate and haptic exploration does not damage the sensor. This work motivates the use of suction cups with autonomous haptic search capabilities in especially adversarial scenarios. \u00c2\u00a9 2004-2012 IEEE.",

      "abstract": "Detecting spoofing attacks on the positions of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) within a swarm is challenging. Traditional methods relying solely on individually reported positions and pairwise distance measurements are ineffective in identifying the misbehavior of malicious UAVs. This paper presents a novel systematic structure designed to detect and mitigate spoofing attacks in UAV swarms. We formulate the problem of detecting malicious UAVs as a localization feasibility problem, leveraging the reported positions and distance measurements. To address this problem, we develop a semidefinite relaxation (SDR) approach, which reformulates the non-convex localization problem into a convex and tractable semidefinite program (SDP). Additionally, we propose two innovative algorithms that leverage the proximity of neighboring UAVs to identify malicious UAVs effectively. Simulations demonstrate the superior performance of our proposed approaches compared to existing benchmarks. Our methods exhibit robustness across various swarm networks, showcasing their effectiveness in detecting and mitigating spoofing attacks. Specifically, the detection success rate is improved by up to 65%, 55%, and 51% against distributed, collusion, and mixed attacks, respectively, compared to the benchmarks. \u00c2\u00a9 2005-2012 IEEE.",

      "abstract": "Dynamic path planning has gained increasing popularity in mobile robot navigation. Some of the current path planning methods require a priori information about the motion space and are easily affected by the distribution of obstacles. To address the above limitation, this paper presents a novel dynamic method that transforms path planning into an optimal control problem and solves it dynamically through adaptive dynamic programming and artificial potential field. The proposed method can obtain optimal paths for a differentially-driven mobile robot model in an unknown environment with many irregular obstacles. First, by combining path optimization and kinematical constraints of the mobile robot, the original problem is transformed into a new problem. Second, the total distance traveled, the effect of heading angle, the distance from the target to the robot, and the resultant force of the artificial potential field are included in the new performance index function. Third, the method based on adaptive dynamic programming is developed to avoid obstacles and guarantee the safety of autonomous navigation. The convergence analysis provides theoretical guarantees for our method, and the iterative control sequence will converge to the optimal control. Furthermore, simulation results and analyses under different complexity levels demonstrate that our method has promising performance in exploring and exploiting dynamic path planning problems. \u00c2\u00a9 2023 Elsevier Ltd",

      "abstract": "Extensive research in the traction component of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV) reveals that selection of electric motor is paramount to enhance its endurance flight time with high efficiency. This can be achieved by employing a motor with light weight, low losses, high efficiency and efficient speed\u2014torque characteristics. For addressing the above-mentioned requirements, an outer-rotor-permanent-magnet-synchronous-motor with inner-periphery-inset-magnet (OR-PMSM-IPIM) structure is selected, as it has eminent electromagnetic performance. To optimize structural design of such geometries, it is important to utilize the better exploration and exploitation of search space of design parameters. Hence, inspired by the high accuracy of optimization obtained by slime mold optimization (SMO) technique, a modified version of this algorithm is developed by introducing its collective behavior and swarm intelligence in the environment. In order to avoid collapsing for local optimal spots and enhance diversity in the population, the introduction of complex group interaction patterns is carried out in the traditional SMO algorithm. In order to verify the effectiveness and convergence speed of proposed methodology, few comparative experiments are administered using Benchmark functions. Through experiments using different integrated collective behaviors (CBs) to SMO, it is found that nearly 10% lesser values are obtained for unimodal and multimodal functions. Also, the convergence profiles are improved by the proposed novel CB-SMO algorithm, when compared to existing SMO technique. The application of proposed method is tested by developing design optimization problem (DOP) for OR-PMSM-IPIM. The analysis results show that the torque-per-unit-weight performance of optimized model of OR-PMSM-IPIM has been increased by 6% through proposed CB-SMO design optimization.",

Different from the existing approaches that require massive computational power to support nonlinear Bayesian estimation and complex decision-making process, an efficient cooperative active-learning-based dual control for exploration and exploitation (COAL-DCEE) is developed for source estimation and path planning. Multiple cooperative estimators are deployed for environment learning process, which is helpful to improving the search performance and robustness against noisy measurements. The number of estimators used in COAL-DCEE is much smaller than that of the particles required for Bayesian estimation in information-theoretic approaches. Consequently, the computational load is significantly reduced. As an important feature of this study, the convergence and performance of COAL-DCEE are established in relation to the characteristics of sensor noises and turbulence disturbances. Numerical and experimental studies have been carried out to verify the effectiveness of the proposed framework. Compared with the existing approaches, COAL-DCEE not only provides convergence guarantee but also yields comparable search performance using much less computational power. IEEE",

      "abstract": "Breast cancer is an extremely serious and lethal form of cancer. It is the second most common cancer among Indian women in rural areas. Early breast cancer detection can considerably enhance the effectiveness of treatment. Early detection of symptoms and signs is the most important technique to effectively treat breast cancer, as it enhances the odds of receiving an earlier, more specialist care. As a result, it has the possibility to significantly improve survival odds by delaying or entirely eliminating cancer. Mammography is a high-resolution radiography technique that is an important factor in avoiding and diagnosing cancer at an early stage. Automatic segmentation of the breast part using mammography pictures can help reduce the area available for cancer search, while also saving time and effort compared to manual segmentation. Previous studies have utilized convolutional and deconvolutional neural networks with autoencoder-like architecture (CN-DCNN) to perform automated breast region segmentation in mammography images. We present Automatic SegmenAN, an end-to-end unique adversarial neural network for the task of segmenting medical images, in this paper. Image segmentation necessitates extensive, pixel-level labeling, a standard GAN's discriminator's single scalar real/fake output may be inefficient in providing steady and appropriate gradient feedback for the networks. Our approach entails using a novel adversarial critic network and a multi-scale L1 loss function to prompt the critic and segmentor for acquiring local as well global features which encompass spatial relationships among pixels at both short and long ranges, instead of employing a segmentor which is a fully convolutional neural network. We demonstrate that an Automatic SegmenAN perspective is more up to date and reliable for segmentation tasks than any latest U-net segmentation technique.",

However, to enable effective mmWave communication within this dynamic network, it is essential to precisely align the steerable antennas mounted on Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) with their corresponding peer units. Therefore, it is important to design a novel approach that can quickly determine an optimized alignment and network topology. In this paper, we propose a Generative Adversarial Network (GAN)-based approach, called WaveGAN, for FANET topology optimization aiming to maximize the network throughput by selecting the communication paths with the best channel conditions. The proposed approach consists of a WaveGAN model followed by a beam search. The former learns how to generate optimized network topologies from a supervised dataset, while the latter adjusts the generated topologies to meet the structure requirements of the mmWave-based FANET. The simulation results show that the proposed approach is able to quickly find FANET topologies with a very small optimality gap for different network sizes.",

      "abstract": "The traditional UAV swarm assessment indicator lacks the whole process description of the performance change after the system is attacked. To meet the realistic demand of increasing resilience requirements for UAV swarm systems, in this paper, we study the modeling and resilience assessment methods of UAV swarm self-organized networks. First, based on complex network theory, a double layer coupled UAV swarm network model considering the communication layer and the structure layer is constructed. Then, three network topological indicators, namely, the average node degree, the average clustering factor, and the average network efficiency, are used to characterize the UAV swarm resilience indicators. Finally, the UAV swarm resilience assessment method, considering dynamic evolution, is designed to realize the resilience assessment of the UAV swarm under different strategies in multiple scenarios. The simulation experiments show that the UAV swarm resilience assessment, considering dynamic reconfiguration, has a strong correlation with the network structure design.",

      "abstract": "The transient wind is one of the dangerous conditions encountered by tethered UAVs operating at the ocean, making the cable and the UAV generate complex nonlinear vibration responses threatening normal operation, even safe flight. There is a lack of research on the nonlinear vibration of the tethered UAV in a transient wind field environment. This study analyzes the vibration response of a tethered quadrotor UAV under a transient wind field, which helps to boost the tethered UAV applications, providing engineering suggestions to design these systems. Considering both cable and UAV motions, the coupled dynamic equations of the tethered UAV system are established based on the Hamilton principle. The variation law of the cable vibration amplitudes with wind field and position is analyzed through a one-minus-cosine gust profile to describe the transient wind field, which can evaluate the dynamic behavior of systems in the actual flight. Moreover, the positions of maximum vibration amplitude in tangential and normal directions are found to be approximately 9/10 and 9/20 from the lower end of the cable. Furthermore, the tethered UAV system vibrations are investigated under different structural parameters. The results indicate that the UAV can maintain a stable single-period motion by increasing the length or elastic modulus or selecting the appropriate diameters of the cable. Finally, an experiment is implemented on the vibration response of the tethered UAV system in a wind tunnel. The theoretical result is compatible with the experimental one, demonstrating the theoretical method&#x2019;s accuracy.",

      "abstract": "Aim: This study aimed to investigate trends over time in pre-hospital factors for pediatric out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (pOHCA) and long-term neurological and neuropsychological outcomes. These have not been described before in large populations. Methods: Non-traumatic arrest patients, 1 day-17 years old, presented to the Sophia Children's Hospital from January 2002 to December 2020, were eligible for inclusion. Favorable neurological outcome was defined as Pediatric Cerebral Performance Categories (PCPC) 1\u00e2\u0080\u00932 or no difference with pre-arrest baseline. The trend over time was tested with multivariable logistic and linear regression models with year of event as independent variable. Findings: Over a nineteen-year study period, the annual rate of long-term favorable neurological outcome, assessed at a median 2.5 years follow-up, increased significantly (OR 1.10, 95%-CI 1.03-1.19), adjusted for confounders. Concurrently, annual automated external defibrillator (AED) use and, among adolescents, initial shockable rhythm increased significantly (OR 1.21, 95% CI 1.10-1.33 and OR 1.15, 95% CI 1.02-1.29, respectively), adjusted for confounders. For generalizability purposes, only the total intelligence quotient (IQ) was considered for trend analysis of all tested domains. Total IQ scores and bystander basic life support (BLS) rate did not change significantly over time. Interpretation: Long-term favorable neurological outcome, assessed at a median 2.5 years follow-up, improved significantly over the study period. Total IQ scores did not significantly change over time. Furthermore, AED use (OR 1.21, 95%CI 1.10-1.33) and shockable rhythms among adolescents (OR1.15, 95%CI 1.02-1.29) increased over time. \u00c2\u00a9 2023 The Author(s)",

      "abstract": "Ensuring safety and achieving human-level driving performance remain challenges for autonomous vehicles, especially in safety-critical situations. As a key component of artificial intelligence, reinforcement learning is promising and has shown great potential in many complex tasks; however, its lack of safety guarantees limits its real-world applicability. Hence, further advancing reinforcement learning, especially from the safety perspective, is of great importance for autonomous driving. As revealed by cognitive neuroscientists, the amygdala of the brain can elicit defensive responses against threats or hazards, which is crucial for survival in and adaptation to risky environments. Drawing inspiration from this scientific discovery, we present a fear-neuro-inspired reinforcement learning framework to realize safe autonomous driving through modeling the amygdala functionality. This new technique facilitates an agent to learn defensive behaviors and achieve safe decision making with fewer safety violations. Through experimental tests, we show that the proposed approach enables the autonomous driving agent to attain state-of-the-art performance compared to the baseline agents and perform comparably to 30 certified human drivers, across various safety-critical scenarios. The results demonstrate the feasibility and effectiveness of our framework while also shedding light on the crucial role of simulating the amygdala function in the application of reinforcement learning to safety-critical autonomous driving domains. \u00c2\u00a9 2023 IEEE.",

      "abstract": "Purpose: Accurate and fast multiorgan segmentation is essential in image-based internal dosimetry in nuclear medicine. While conventional manual PET image segmentation is widely used, it suffers from both being time-consuming as well as subject to human error. This study exploited 2D and 3D deep learning (DL) models. Key organs in the trunk of the body were segmented and then used as a reference for networks. Methods: The pre-trained p2p-U-Net-GAN and HighRes3D architectures were fine-tuned with PET-only images as inputs. Additionally, the HighRes3D model was alternatively trained with PET/CT images. Evaluation metrics such as sensitivity (SEN), specificity (SPC), intersection over union (IoU), and Dice scores were considered to assess the performance of the networks. The impact of DL-assisted PET image segmentation methods was further assessed using the Monte Carlo (MC)-derived S-values to be used for internal dosimetry. Results: A fair comparison with manual low-dose CT-aided segmentation of the PET images was also conducted. Although both 2D and 3D models performed well, the HighRes3D offers superior performance with Dice scores higher than 0.90. Key evaluation metrics such as SEN, SPC, and IoU vary between 0.89\u00e2\u0080\u00930.93, 0.98\u00e2\u0080\u00930.99, and 0.87\u00e2\u0080\u00930.89 intervals, respectively, indicating the encouraging performance of the models. The percentage differences between the manual and DL segmentation methods in the calculated S-values varied between 0.1% and 6% with a maximum attributed to the stomach. Conclusion: The findings prove while the incorporation of anatomical information provided by the CT data offers superior performance in terms of Dice score, the performance of HighRes3D remains comparable without the extra CT channel. It is concluded that both proposed DL-based methods provide automated and fast segmentation of whole-body PET/CT images with promising evaluation metrics. Between them, the HighRes3D is more pronounced by providing better performance and can therefore be the method of choice for 18F-FDG-PET image segmentation. \u00c2\u00a9 2024 The Authors.

      "abstract": "This paper presents a novel detection and rerouting mechanism for distributed adaptive platoon control of non-linear autonomous connected vehicles under denial of service (DoS) attacks. DoS attacks can cause delays or losses of data packets due to blocked communication channels, leading to reducing platoon performance or even collisions among vehicles. To tackle this issue, the proposed mechanism detects and reroutes communication topology depending on the real-time topology and the number of link failures. Real-time detection divides the scenario of DoS attacks into three parts. According to the different scenarios, rerouting mechanisms will be utilized. A controller adapted to real-time variable communication topology is also designed in this scheme. The adjacency matrix of the real-time communication topology generated by the rerouting mechanism is used to update the controller so that the platoon can remain in a stable state without being affected by DoS attacks. In addition, the sliding mode controller and the observer are designed by solving linear matrix inequalities, and the platoon stability and internal stability are proven. Numerical simulation studies demonstrate that the proposed mechanism and control design can reduce the vehicle state estimate error and platoon-tracking error to ideal states under DoS attacks. The proposed method solves the problem that the existing methods have not considered the number of link failures and the inability to restore communication when the communication topology is paralyzed. \u00c2\u00a9 2024 The Authors.

      "abstract": "The integration of artificial intelligence (AI) in diagnosing diabetic retinopathy, a major contributor to global vision impairment, is becoming increasingly pronounced. Notably, the detection of vision-threatening diabetic retinopathy (VTDR) has been significantly fortified through automated techniques. Traditionally, the reliance on manual analysis of retinal images, albeit slow and error-prone, constituted the conventional approach. Addressing this, our study introduces a novel methodology that amplifies the robustness and precision of the detection process. This is complemented by the groundbreaking Hierarchical Block Attention (HBA) and HBA-U-Net architecture, which notably propel attention mechanisms in image segmentation. This innovative model refines image processing without imposing excessive computational demands by honing in on individual pixel intricacies, spatial relationships, and channel-specific attention. Building upon this innovation, our proposed method employs a multi-stage strategy encompassing data pre-processing, feature extraction via a hybrid CNN-SVD model, and classification employing an amalgamation of Improved Support Vector Machine-Radial Basis Function (ISVM-RBF), DT, and KNN techniques. Rigorously tested on the IDRiD dataset classified into five severity tiers, the hybrid model yields remarkable performance, achieving a 99.18% accuracy, 98.15% sensitivity, and 100% specificity in VTDR detection, thus surpassing existing methods. These results underscore a more potent avenue for diagnosing and addressing this crucial ocular condition while underscoring AI\u2019s transformative potential in medical care, particularly in ophthalmology.",

      "abstract": "Autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs) are applied in a variety of industries to increase the efficiency and safety of maritime operations. Traditional docking and recovery techniques for AUVs, however, can be inefficient. Therefore, the development of a dynamic underwater recovery mechanism for AUVs is now needed. Recent research has investigated the symbiotic relationship between the remora fish and the shark from a hydrodynamic perspective. Numerical simulations have demonstrated that by exploiting the boundary layer and adverse pressure gradient regions around the shark, the resistance experienced by remora fish can be significantly reduced. Inspired by this, an AUV was designed, and numerical simulations were conducted to investigate the impact of various attachment locations. Moreover, simulations were performed to investigate the hydrodynamic characteristics of the AUV during the docking process, specifically when it enters the boundary layer of the submarine and approaches it. The boundary layer flow, which influences the AUV's resistance, can also provide a force that attract the AUV towards the submarine. This research identifies an optimal attachment location and investigates the effects on the AUV when two underwater vehicles of significantly different sizes are in close proximity. It supports further study to develop a dynamic underwater docking operation. \u00c2\u00a9 2023 The Authors",

      "abstract": "Post-disaster scene understanding frameworks are increasingly crucial in Search And Rescue (SAR) operations. Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) provide an efficient means to carry out the task of scene understanding due to the higher altitudes at which they function. However, complex environments in post-disaster scenarios make it difficult for UAVs to detect humans or objects accurately. Inefficient object detection mechanisms lead to low accuracy for object detection tasks. Hence, to mitigate these issues, we propose a UAV and GAN-aided Ensemble Network (UGEN) framework for efficient ORAN-based post-disaster survivor detection. This approach deploys a Context-Conditional Generative Adversarial Network (CCGAN)- based model to remove occlusion in the images obtained from the UAVs. The UGEN framework classifies entities present in the visual scope of the UAV using a semantic segmentation framework deployed on the CCGAN-enhanced images, resulting in a pixel-level prediction of entities present in the post-disaster images. An ensemble network comprising a combination of single-stage and multi-stage detectors detects survivors present in the post-disaster scenario, thereby combining the benefits of both architectures, resulting in a reduced false negative rate and improved performance. An Open Radio Access Network (ORAN) executes data propagation between the UAV and the ground station for reduced transmission latency. The proposed model achieved a survivor detection accuracy of 96.7%. Authors",

      "abstract": "A novel technique for effervescent-based dispersive liquid\u00e2\u0080\u0093liquid microextraction is reported. Rapid and continuous effervescence, driven by hydrogen bubbles, was utilized to transfer the analyte from the aqueous to the organic phase. The reactivity of magnesium metal with water was exploited to generate a stream of hydrogen bubbles. In this method, an aqueous sample solution, contained in a microcentrifuge tube, was treated with 1 mg of magnesium and 100 \u00c2\u00b5l of 1-undecanol. Microextraction was initiated by the addition of 100 \u00c2\u00b5l of 1 M sodium bicarbonate to induce a rapid stream of hydrogen bubbles. The microcentrifuge tube was cooled to allow the solidification of 1-undecanol which was carefully separated and analyzed. Factors potentially affecting extraction efficiency were optimized, including the magnesium mass, concentration of sodium bicarbonate, extraction time, pH, open/closed system, sample volume, temperature, and analyte concentrations. These studies revealed the required speed and minimum concentration of sodium bicarbonate, as well as the possibility of efficient microextraction without sodium bicarbonate but in acidic conditions or at elevated temperatures (45\u00e2\u0080\u009350 \u00c2\u00b0C). The analytical performance was assessed and demonstrated to be promising. In the case of the model drug quercetin, the limit of detection (LOD) was determined to be 0.051 \u00c2\u00b5g/ml, the limit of quantification (LOQ) was 0.154 \u00c2\u00b5g/ml, and the extraction efficiency was 100%. The applicability of this method was also evaluated on samples with variable physicochemical properties, demonstrating an automated, fast, and efficient liquid\u00e2\u0080\u0093liquid microextraction protocol. \u00c2\u00a9 2024 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",

      "abstract": "Multi-agent systems (MAS) have gained increasing research attention in recent years due to their wide applications in cooperative control of autonomous vehicles, sensor networks, robotics, etc. However, designing effective distributed control strategies for MAS with complex dynamics remains challenging. This paper proposes an improved differential evolution (DE) based cooperative control strategy to stabilize and synchronize MAS with uncertain nonlinear dynamics. Specifically, we develop a new mutation strategy inspired by opposition-based learning to enhance the exploration ability and adopt an adaptive parameter mechanism to balance exploration and exploitation. Moreover, a distributed sliding mode term is incorporated in the control input to counteract uncertainties and external disturbances. Rigorous stability analysis shows that the closed-loop MAS can achieve synchronization under the proposed control strategy. Extensive simulations demonstrate that compared to other state-of-the-art DE algorithms and cooperative control methods, the proposed strategy achieves lower synchronization error, control cost, higher convergence speed, and higher accuracy for MAS with different scales, dynamics, and uncertainties. \u00c2\u00a9 2023 Elsevier B.V.",

      "abstract": "The spotlight of our discussion here is on developing a model for detecting snakes present in the agricultural fields using cameras and machine learning algorithms. The idea is to construct a machine learning model to identify the snakes, which will be trained on a vast set of images of snakes. These images will be carefully selected to include the snake patterns, skin color of different species of snakes (extraction of the unique features). This is done to train the model properly to identify different types of snakes that the farmer encounters in the fields. Most famers are unaware and have a need for a way to detect these snakes so that they can either avoid them or get rid of them. Hence, this system can be implemented to prevent thousands of deaths and can help famers alleviate the repercussions of snake bites. Mistakes in recognizing potentially harmful animal species based only on visual cues are major contributors to the high death toll from venomous animal attacks. Since they spend so much time in the fields, where rice and wheat are cultivated, farmers are at a higher risk of being bitten by a snake than the general population. Because of their ignorance, illiterate farmers are more inclined to believe in superstitions, which can lead to their untimely deaths from snakebites despite medical intervention. Animals that would normally pose no threat to humans are responsible for the deaths of thousands of people every year because of environmental factors. However, because it is hard for humans to recognize these dangers, a new design paradigm has been developed to make it simpler. Researchers in the field of animal biology can use it to search for endangered species. Predators may enter gardens and green areas like tea and coffee plantations. There is not yet a plan in place to implement automated sorting for discovering distinctions. By applying the suggested framework to photographs of potentially dangerous animals, several factors useful for studying animal organization may be easily identified. For the classifier to run in real-time, it is suggested that YOLO be utilized for double processing within the framework. Furthermore, the YOLO technique enables quick animal recognition in a similar fashion. First, the YOLO method will be used to determine whether a snake is present in the proposed work. Here, 87 percent precision is also reached in the detection of snakes.",

      "abstract": "A receiver architecture for cognitive sensing and navigation with orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM)-based systems is proposed. The proposed receiver enables exploiting all the transmitted periodic beacons of 5G new radio (NR) and Starlink low Earth orbit (LEO) signals to draw navigation observables. Reference signals (RSs) of modern OFDM-based systems, such as 5G NR, contain both always-on and on-demand components. These components can be unknown or known but subject to change. To leverage all transmitted signals for navigation purposes, the RS signals should be detected and tracked cognitively. Similar to conventional navigation receivers, the proposed architecture involves acquisition and tracking stages. However, both stages are supplemented by the unorthodox capability of estimating and updating the RS signals. The acquisition stage instructs the tracking stage by reporting performance metrics, which are used to adjust the tracking loop gains to update the RS accordingly. A chirp model is considered to capture the high dynamics of Doppler frequency in intensive Doppler scenarios, where the navigating vehicle is maneuvering or the transmitting source is not static. The effect of Doppler rate estimation error on frame length estimation is analyzed. Experimental results are presented demonstrating the performance of the proposed receiver by: (i) enabling an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) to detect and exploit terrestrial 5G NR cellular signals in a blind fashion for navigation purposes, achieving a two-dimensional (2D) root-mean squared error (RMSE) of 4.2 m over a total trajectory of 416 m; (ii) enabling a ground vehicle that traversed a trajectory of 1.79 km to cognitively sense an unknown gNB (blindly detect, track, and exploit transmitted always-on and on-demand signals), localizing it with a 2D error of 5.83 m; and (iii) tracking Starlink LEO OFDM signals, producing Doppler measurements, which were fused to localize a stationary receiver with a 2D error of 6.5 m, starting from an initial estimate 179 km away from the receiver's true position. \u00c2\u00a9 1983-2012 IEEE.",

      "abstract": "There is a definite possibility that, in a recent future, Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) will form the backbone of any smart city in terms of automation and networking. One approach to extend the UAVs' resources spectrum is to provide a mean for them to opportunistically recharge and connect to otherwise unreachable networks: provide Training and Recharge Areas (TRAs). In these dedicated areas, the UAVs could dock to Energy and Data Dispensers (EDD) devices to resupply their batteries and exploit a high-speed connection. To autonomously move through the smart city while accomplishing a set of given tasks but, at the same time, consider visiting the EDDs, is part of a tridimensional trajectory planning problem that needs to be addressed. In this paper, we formally define the combinatorial optimization problem representing the trajectory planning. We consider the case in which more than one UAV can be connected with the same EDD at the same time, by properly addressing the assignment of the bandwidth. Through simulative investigation, realistic values for the solution of the optimization problem are found. The behavior of the proposed model is compared with an 'online' approach that does not require the same resources and knowledge and whose evaluation and comparison with the 'offline' approach are performed through network simulation. \u00c2\u00a9 2002-2012 IEEE.",

      "abstract": "Background and objective: The adoption of new technologies in clinical care systems has propitiated the availability of a great amount of valuable data. However, this data is usually heterogeneous, requiring its harmonization to be integrated and analysed. We propose a semantic-driven harmonization framework that (1) enables the meaningful sharing and integration of healthcare data across institutions and (2) facilitates the analysis and exploitation of the shared data. Methods: The framework includes an ontology-based common data model (i.e. SCDM), a data transformation pipeline and a semantic query system. Heterogeneous datasets, mapped to different terminologies, are integrated by using an ontology-based infrastructure rooted in a top-level ontology. A graph database is generated by using these mappings, and web-based semantic query system facilitates data exploration. Results: Several datasets from different European institutions have been integrated by using the framework in the context of the European H2020 Precise4Q project. Through the query system, data scientists were able to explore data and use it for building machine learning models. Conclusions: The flexible data representation using RDF, together with the formal semantic underpinning provided by the SCDM, have enabled the semantic integration, query and advanced exploitation of heterogeneous data in the context of the Precise4Q project. \u00c2\u00a9 2023 The Author(s)",

Additionally, we integrate the Byzantine fault-tolerant algorithm (BFT) into the node verification component of the delegated proof of stake (DPoS) to minimize verification delays.

      "abstract": "This work focuses on the optimal trajectory of a rotary-wing unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) jammer and the system power allocation with the objective of maximizing the total secure energy efficiency (EE) of a slotted relay-assisted millimeter wave (mm-Wave) cognitive radio system. The UAV flies from starting location to final one in a round of communication mission that is overheard by a malicious eavesdropper. The network terminals are equipped with multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) antenna array. This work first develops a practical approximation propagation model by addressing three key challenges: path loss, small-scale Nakagami-m fading channel gains, and transceiver antenna beamforming gains. By using the approximate model, the upper and lower bounds of the ergodic rate of each communication link are derived. Second, with the objective of maximizing secure EE, the optimal UAV trajectory and system resource allocation framework is established by considering the constraints of interference at primary receiver (PR), information-causality relationship, rotary-wing UAV propulsion energy and so forth. The optimal framework is solved with a tractable CVX tool by using the derived upper and lower bounds and successive convex approximation. Finally, an iterative optimizing algorithm is established by using Dinkelbach's method. In the simulation, the work presents the comparison of UAV trajectories, secure rates, and secure EEs of three schemes, that is, the proposed EE scheme, the non-EE scheme where only the optimal secure rate is considered, and the EE scheme with the consideration of all communication-related energy consumption. The simulations show that the EE schemes achieve smoother UAV trajectory than non-EE, but the non-EE scheme has higher secure rate. The impact of communication energy consumption is negligible. In addition, the effect of MIMO antenna array and mm-Wave on system performance is exploited. \u00c2\u00a9 2023 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.",

      "abstract": "In recent years, the industry and research have cast great attention to the Internet of Drones (IoD), which is becoming progressively popular since it can bring a great convenience to various application scenarios, such as national map exploration, public safety monitoring and automated military applications. In these scenarios, Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) (called drones) will be used to collect private information. Due to the fact that the private information are very sensitive, and drones working in public places easily suffer from physical capture or tampering attacks, the primary concern is that this information could be collected by adversaries or unauthorized users. In addition, as resource-constrained devices, drones are mostly equipped with small memory and have limited computing power. Therefore, how to ensure robust security as much as possible while achieving lightweight computing and communication costs has become an urgent problem to be solved in this field. In this paper, we propose A PUF-based Robust and Lightweight Authentication Protocol for Drone-Gateway and Drone-Drone Communication (PRLAP-IoD) to address these issues. Both formal security validation using conventional tools (ROR Model and AVISPA) and other informal security analysis clearly demonstrate that PRLAP-IoD can not only provide physical security, but also defend against a variety of known attacks. Finally, compared with the recent Authentication and Key Agreement (AKA) schemes, PRLAP-IoD can attain a delicate balance between computation cost and communication cost in IoD environment. \u00c2\u00a9 2023 Elsevier B.V.",

      "abstract": "Continuously increasing micro meteorite and orbital debris (MMOD) in space poses a threat to any manned or unmanned space vehicle with increasing probability of damaging object impact. To address the sufficient level of protection of space vessels, many Whipple shield configurations has been studied for over half a century. Bumper plate of Whipple shields studied in existing literature are flat surfaced plates. In contrast to earlier studies, this paper investigates the reaction of bumper plates with wavy surfaces against hypervelocity impact by analysing how they contribute to projectile fragmentation, formation of debris cloud, and how they dissipate the impact energy. Aluminium plates with four different surface wave profiles (WPs) were numerically investigated under hypervelocity impact conditions to assess their performance on disintegration of the impacting projectile. Fragmentation patterns of spherical aluminium projectile and debris cloud generated by projectile-wavy plate couples were examined and compared with the equivalents observed in flat-surfaced plate impact. A hybrid Smoothed Particle Hydrodynamics (SPH) combined with finite element modelling (FEM) approach was adopted using ANSYS software to simulate hypervelocity impact phenomenon at 3 km/s. Results of the numerical work carried out in this study revealed the distinctive debris cloud generation that has never been reported before in the existing literature. Furthermore, compared to the flat plate, wavy plates are found to be more effective in decreasing the impact energy. \u00c2\u00a9 2023 Elsevier Ltd",

      "abstract": "Wheat leaf disease prevention and treatment requires an accurate and rapid classification of wheat leaf diseases and their extent. Using healthy wheat, leaf rust, crown, root rot, and wheat loose smut as research objects, this study proposes a deep learning-based technique for classifying wheat leaf diseases. A collaborative generative adversarial network is used as an image imputation in the proposed methodology, allowing a generator and discriminator network to properly estimate the missing data in the dataset using the residual method. It is used to improve feature extraction in wheat leaf images. The major contribution of this study is to use a pre-trained deep learning convolutional neural network architecture as a foundation to improve and construct an automated tool for wheat leaf disease image categorization. To classify wheat leaf diseases, a modification to the Residual Network with 50 layers (ResNet50) is being suggested. The \u2032Conv\u2032, \u2032Batch Normaliz\u2032, and \u2032Activation Leaky Relu\u2032 layers were added as part of this modification. These layers are inserted into the ResNet50 architecture for accurate feature extraction and discrimination. Extensive tests are carried out to evaluate the proposed model's performance on photos from a large wheat disease classification dataset. The suggested approach outperforms ResNet50, InceptionV3, and DenseNet, according to the experimental findings. The suggested method achieves the greatest identification accuracy of 98.44%. These discoveries might aid in the accurate detection and categorization of wheat leaf diseases.",

      "abstract": "Gullies are common in areas of unconsolidated deposit soil, and relatively steep-sided erosion that spread quickly in depth and width over short periods may occur during heavy or extended rainfall and. Soil erosion has been recognized as the major cause of land degradation worldwide, especially in the East African Rift Valley of Kenya where thick layers of volcanic ash have been deposited. This paper reports the results of studying the evolutionary process of gully erosion and types of gullies in the East African Rift Valley in Kenya over the last 50 years using remote sensing images, field investigations, and UAV (Unmanned Aerial Vehicle) aerial photography. Forward expansion, backward expansion, new gullies, and road culvert gullies were classified according to their morphological evolution characteristics and then identified throughout the history of the valley over the past 50 years. The erosion length increase from forward expansion was the largest of the four categories, followed by backward expansion, new gullies, and road culvert gullies. Human activity and rainstorms are the main factors of gully erosion in the study area. Additionally, four types of gullies were also categorized according to their causes of formation via field investigation and testing: physically-induced gullies, artificially-induced gullies, pipe erosion-induced gullies, and fissure-induced gullies, and artificially-induced and fissure-induced gullies were the most common type of gully in the study area. The evolution of gullies poses a serious threat to the ecological environment since it can lead to grassland degradation, segmentation of landscape ecology, and the erosion of the survival environment of wildlife. In this regard, man-made and fissure-caused gullies are the most severe and should be investigated further. \u00c2\u00a9 2023 Elsevier Ltd",

      "abstract": "As threat vectors and adversarial capabilities evolve, Cloud-Assisted Connected and Autonomous Vehicles (CCAVs) are becoming more vulnerable to cyberattacks. Several established threat analysis and risk assessment (TARA) methodologies are publicly available to address the evolving threat landscape. However, these methodologies inadequately capture the threat data of CCAVs, resulting in poorly defined threat boundaries or the reduced efficacy of the TARA. This is due to multiple factors, including complex hardware\u2013software interactions, rapid technological advancements, outdated security frameworks, heterogeneous standards and protocols, and human errors in CCAV systems. To address these factors, this study begins by systematically evaluating TARA methods and applying the Spoofing, Tampering, Repudiation, Information disclosure, Denial of service, and Elevation of privileges (STRIDE) threat model and Damage, Reproducibility, Exploitability, Affected Users, and Discoverability (DREAD) risk assessment to target system architectures. This study identifies vulnerabilities, quantifies risks, and methodically examines defined data processing components. In addition, this study offers an attack tree to delineate attack vectors and provides a novel defense taxonomy against identified risks. This article demonstrates the efficacy of the TARA in systematically capturing compromised security requirements, threats, limits, and associated risks with greater precision. By doing so, we further discuss the challenges in protecting hardware\u2013software assets against multi-staged attacks due to emerging vulnerabilities. As a result, this research informs advanced threat analyses and risk management strategies for enhanced security engineering of cyberphysical CCAV systems.",

      "abstract": "One of the threats to industrial unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), which require a high level of safety, is the degradation of control wireless communication performance due to electromagnetic interference. Self-jamming caused by unintentional electromagnetic (EM) noises from the multiple electronic devices installed in a UAV, such as the power supply and camera, is a fundamental issue independent of the surrounding environment. UAVs are susceptible to self-jamming since electronic devices as noise sources are densely mounted inside their chassis. Therefore, evaluating the self-jamming problem and taking countermeasures to achieve high safety in wireless communication performance are important. In this paper, we focus on mobile communications used for UAV operation and evaluate the impact of EM noise generated by a commercial industrial UAV on the receiver sensitivity of an onboard mobile communication device. It was found that EM noise generated by the UAV degrades the sensitivity in the three communication bands, 800 MHz, 1800 MHz, and 2100 MHz, used over the air. In particular, receiver sensitivity was degraded by up to 29 dB in the 800 MHz band, indicating that the self-jamming problem is not negligible for the safe operation of industrial UAVs. In addition, countermeasures for self-jamming were taken at the mechanical design level to suppress EM noise to a level that does not degrade mobile communication performance. The results of this study show that countermeasures for self-jamming are an important element for safe UAV operation. Authors",

      "abstract": "Background: There are conflicting data on the effect of cardiac resynchronization therapy with a defibrillator (CRT-D) on the risk of life-threatening ventricular tachyarrhythmia in heart failure patients. Objectives: The authors aimed to assess whether QRS morphology is associated with risk of ventricular arrhythmias in CRT recipients. Methods: The study population comprised 2,862 patients implanted with implantable cardioverter defibrillator (ICD)/CRT-D for primary prevention who were enrolled in 5 landmark primary prevention ICD trials (MADIT-II [Multicenter Automated Defibrillator Implantation Trial], MADIT-CRT [Multicenter Automated Defibrillator Implantation Trial-Cardiac Resynchronization Therapy], MADIT-RIT [Multicenter Automated Defibrillator Implantation Trial-Reduction in Inappropriate Therapy], MADIT-RISK [Multicenter Automated Defibrillator Implantation Trial-RISK], and RAID [Ranolazine in High-Risk Patients With Implanted Cardioverter Defibrillators]). Patients with QRS duration \u00e2\u0089\u00a5130 ms were divided into 2 groups: those implanted with an ICD only vs CRT-D. The primary endpoint was fast ventricular tachycardia (VT)/ventricular fibrillation (VF) (defined as VT \u00e2\u0089\u00a5200 beats/min or VF), accounting for the competing risk of death. Secondary endpoints included appropriate shocks, any sustained VT or VF, and the burden of fast VT/VF, assessed in a recurrent event analysis. Results: Among patients with left bundle branch block (n = 1,792), those with CRT-D (n = 1,112) experienced a significant 44% (P < 0.001) reduction in the risk of fast VT/VF compared with ICD-only patients (n = 680), a significantly lower burden of fast VT/VF (HR: 0.55; P = 0.001), with a reduced burden of appropriate shocks (HR: 0.44; P < 0.001). In contrast, among patients with non-left bundle branch block (NLBBB) (N = 1,070), CRT-D was not associated with reduction in fast VT/VF (HR: 1.33; P = 0.195). Furthermore, NLBBB patients with CRT-D experienced a statistically significant increase in the burden of fast VT/VF events compared with ICD-only patients (HR: 1.90; P = 0.013). Conclusions: Our data suggest a potential proarrhythmic effect of CRT among patients with NLBBB. These data should be considered in patient selection for treatment with CRT. \u00c2\u00a9 2024 American College of Cardiology Foundation",

      "abstract": "X-ray imaging technologies find applications across various domains, including medical imaging in health institutions or security in military facilities and public institutions. X-ray images acquired from diverse sources necessitate analysis by either trained human experts or automated systems. In cases where concealed electronic cards potentially pose threats, such as in laptops harboring explosive triggering circuits, conventional analysis methods are challenging to detect, even when scrutinized by skilled. The present investigation is centered on the utilization of deep learning algorithms for the analysis of X-ray images of laptop computers, with the aim of identifying concealed hazardous components. To construct the dataset, some control cards such as Arduino, Raspberry Pi and Bluetooth circuits were hidden inside the 60 distinct laptop computers and were subjected to X-ray imaging, yielding a total of 5094 X-ray images. The primary objective of this study is to distinguish laptops based on the presence or absence of concealed electronic cards. To this end, a suite of deep learning models, including EfficientNet, DenseNet, DarkNet19, DarkNet53, Inception, MobileNet, ResNet18, ResNet50, ResNet101, ShuffleNet and Xception were subjected to training, testing, and comparative evaluation. The performance of these models was assessed utilizing a range of metrics, encompassing accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, precision, f-measure, and g-mean. Among the various models examined, the ShuffleNet model emerged as the top-performing one, yielding superior results in terms of accuracy (0.8355), sensitivity (0.8199), specificity (0.8530), precision (0.8490), f-measure (0.8322), and g-mean (0.8352). \u00c2\u00a9 2023 Elsevier B.V.",

Accordingly, this study commences by analyzing the object detection performance before and after rain removal, respectively.

      "abstract": "In the face of global biodiversity loss that threatens social\u00e2\u0080\u0093ecological sustainability, we must improve our knowledge of species' behaviours, life histories and populations. Enhanced understanding is especially critical for taxa like seabirds that live in remote habitats where monitoring is logistically challenging, and technology-based approaches could lead to major advances. Considering conservation threats and breeding behaviours, penguins represent a promising taxon for further exploration of monitoring methods. Only five of 18 penguin species are currently considered species of Least Concern by the IUCN, and the sensitivity of penguins to ecological disturbances makes them important indicators of ecosystem dynamics. Penguins regularly congregate in dense breeding colonies and are visually and aurally conspicuous animals, making them relatively easy to monitor in some respects. In situ observations and visual remote sensing monitoring methods (i.e. camera traps, uncrewed aerial vehicles and satellite imagery) currently provide highly valuable information on penguin behaviour and population dynamics, but these methods have a number of shortcomings. Several rely on human presence in remote areas, some require clean lines of sight with no visual obstructions, and some offer limited spatial and temporal resolution. In this study we explore the use of passive acoustic monitoring (PAM) as a complementary remote sensing method to monitor penguin behaviour and populations at high spatial and temporal resolution without visual constraints or the need for continuous human presence. We conducted observations of vocalization rates and placed automated acoustic recorders in colonies of Magellanic Penguins Spheniscus magellanicus and Southern Rockhopper Penguins Eudyptes chrysocome in conjunction with camera traps. We found positive relationships between acoustic activity and counts of Magellanic Penguins in camera trap photos. We also identified clear diel patterns of acoustic activity that differed between breeding stages, and we found positive correlations between acoustic activity and estimates of colony density for various times of day and radii around recorders. While much work remains to improve this method and refine interpretation, PAM holds great promise as a complementary tool for monitoring the relative abundance and behavioural dynamics of penguins and other colonial animals, particularly those that burrow or nest in dense vegetation that impairs visual monitoring techniques. \u00c2\u00a9 2023 British Ornithologists' Union.",

      "abstract": "Precise real-time unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) positioning is crucial for preventing unauthorized UAVs from damaging cooperative intelligent transportation systems (C-ITSs). However, UAV positioning remains extremely challenging due to the small target size and high flexibility. Therefore, we develop a modal-oriented self-tuning fusion framework for precise UAV millimeter-wave(MMW)-vision positioning. The framework selects and extracts cross-modal features based on modality characters, and migrates the Doppler features of MMW radar data to the image features for precise pixel-level positioning. Based on the framework, a modal-oriented self-tuning fusion network is proposed to adaptively enhance UAV feature without direct supervision by exploiting the cross-modal correlations. A novel characteristic-based 3DMMW feature extraction method is presented to extract UAV Doppler motion characteristics while a self-tuning cross-modal affine transfer is proposed for UAV visual feature enhancement. Due to lack of dataset for our task, we establish a practical positioning platform and two novel datasets containing synchronized visual images and MMW radio frequency (RF) sequences in various scenarios. Experimental results confirm that our framework outperforms the benchmark methods in terms of positioning accuracy while maintaining real-time performance. Moreover, ablation studies also confirm the effectiveness of each module in the framework. \u00c2\u00a9 1983-2012 IEEE.",

Currently, the map labeling algorithms are based on rules defined by experts for optimizing the placement of the text labels on maps. In this paper, we investigate the feasibility of using well-labeled map samples as a source of knowledge for automating the labeling process. The basic idea is to train deep learning models, specifically the generative models CycleGAN and Pix2Pix, on a large number of map examples. Then, the trained models are used to predict good locations of the labels given unlabeled raster maps. We compare the results obtained by the deep learning models to manual map labeling and a state-of-the-art optimization-based labeling method. A quantitative evaluation is performed in terms of legibility, association and map readability as well as a visual evaluation performed by three professional cartographers. The evaluation indicates that the deep learning models are capable of finding appropriate positions for the labels, but that they, in this implementation, are not well suited for selecting the labels to show and to determine the size of the labels. The result provides valuable insights into the current capabilities of generative models for such task, while also identifying the key challenges that will shape future research directions. \u00c2\u00a9 2023 The Author(s).

      "abstract": "This paper addresses the trajectory-tracking problem under uncertain road-surface conditions for autonomous vehicles. We propose a stochastic nonlinear model predictive controller (SNMPC) that learns a tyre\u00e2\u0080\u0093road friction model online using standard automotive-grade sensors. Learning the entire tyre\u00e2\u0080\u0093road friction model in real time requires driving in the nonlinear, potentially unstable regime of the vehicle dynamics, using a prediction model that may not have fully converged. To handle this, we formulate the tyre-friction model learning in a Bayesian framework and propose two estimators that learn different aspects of the tyre\u00e2\u0080\u0093road friction. The estimators output the estimate of the tyre-friction model as well as the uncertainty of the estimate, which expresses the confidence in the model for different driving regimes. The SNMPC exploits the uncertainty estimate in its prediction model to take proper action when the uncertainty is large. We validate the approach in an extensive Monte Carlo study using real vehicle parameters and in CarSim. The results when comparing to various MPC approaches indicate a substantial reduction in constraint violations, as well as a reduction in closed-loop cost. We also demonstrate the real-time feasibility in automotive-grade processors using a dSPACE MicroAutoBox-II rapid prototyping unit, showing a worst-case computation time of roughly 40 ms. \u00c2\u00a9 2023 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.",

      "abstract": "Spiking Neural Networks (SNN) promise extremely low-power and low-latency inference on neuromorphic hardware. Recent studies demonstrate the competitive performance of SNNs compared with Artificial Neural Networks (ANN) in conventional classification tasks. In this work, we present an energy-efficient implementation of a Reinforcement Learning (RL) algorithm using SNNs to solve an obstacle avoidance task performed by an Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV), taking a Dynamic Vision Sensor (DVS) as event-based input. We train the SNN directly, improving upon state-of-art implementations based on hybrid (not directly trained) SNNs. For this purpose, we devise an adaptation of the Spatio-Temporal Backpropagation algorithm (STBP) for RL. We then compare the SNN with a state-of-art Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) designed to solve the same task. To this aim, we train both networks by exploiting a photorealistic training pipeline based on AirSim. To achieve a realistic latency and throughput assessment for embedded deployment, we designed and trained three different embedded SNN versions to be executed on state-of-art neuromorphic hardware, targeting state-of-the-art. We compared SNN and CNN in terms of obstacle avoidance performance showing that the SNN algorithm achieves better results than the CNN with a factor of 6\u00c3\u0097 less energy. We also characterize the different SNN hardware implementations in terms of energy and spiking activity. \u00c2\u00a9 2023 The Authors",

      "abstract": "Quantum dot-based materials have been found to be excellent platforms for biosensing and bioimaging applications. Herein, self-propelled microrobots made of graphene quantum dots (GQD-MRs) have been synthesized and explored as unconventional dynamic biocarriers toward the optical \u00e2\u0080\u009con-the-fly\u00e2\u0080\u009d monitoring of DNA. As a first demonstration of applicability, GQD-MRs have been first biofunctionalized with a DNA biomarker (i.e., fluorescein amidite-labeled, FAM-L) via hydrophobic \u00cf\u0080-stacking interactions and subsequently exposed toward different concentrations of a DNA target. The biomarker-target hybridization process leads to a biomarker release from the GQD-MR surface, resulting in a linear alteration in the fluorescence intensity of the dynamic biocarrier at the nM range (1-100 nM, R2 = 0.99), also demonstrating excellent selectivity and sensitivity, with a detection limit as low as 0.05 nM. Consequently, the developed dynamic biocarriers, which combine the appealing features of GQDs (e.g., water solubility, fluorescent activity, and supramolecular \u00cf\u0080-stacking interactions) with the autonomous mobility of MRs, present themselves as potential autonomous micromachines to be exploited as highly efficient and sensitive \u00e2\u0080\u009con-the-fly\u00e2\u0080\u009d biosensing systems. This method is general and can be simply customized by tailoring the biomarker anchored to the GQD-MR\u00e2\u0080\u0099s surface. \u00c2\u00a9 2023 The Authors.

      "abstract": "Introduction. Artificial neural networks are widely utilized in medical fields, such as dentistry, molecular genetics, immunology, cardiology, and others. Forensic medicine is no exception, as artificial neural networks are also beginning to find applications in this field. The aim of this study was to demonstrate the potential for predicting human anthropometric parameters using dermatoglyphic parameters, which could enhance the method of dermatoglyphic identification. Materials and methods. We analyzed dermatoglyphs of the hands and feet from 567 individuals aged 18 to 59 years, with no genetic or endocrine disorders and no musculoskeletal problems. Results and discussion. The outcome of our work resulted in the development of the \u00c2\u00abDermatoglyphics For Prediction (DFP)\u00c2\u00bb program [Author\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Certificate No. 74561.

This software device, after appropriate training, enables the prediction of an individual\u00e2\u0080\u0099s ethnic-territorial affiliation and the presence of specific anthropometric parameters using such input data as dermatoglyphs of the hands and feet. Conclusions. The increasing needs of the Ukrainian community for the identification of unknown individuals, given the geopolitical situation related to Russian invasion in Ukraine (the constant threat of ballistic missile attacks and unmanned aerial vehicles across the entire territory of Ukraine, which could lead to mass casualties), justify the relevance and the search for innovative approaches to dermatoglyphic identification expertise, utilizing state-of-the-art technologies, particularly neural network-based prediction of anthropometric parameters, sex, and ethnic-territorial affiliation of an unknown person, using input parameters such as dermatoglyphs of the hands and feet, with the aim of enhancing the evidentiary value of identification expertise. This software device, after appropriate training, allows for the prediction of ethnic-territorial affiliation and the presence of specific anthropometric parameters in the examined individual using such input data as dermatoglyphs of the hands and feet. \u00c2\u00a9 2023, State Institution of Science \"Research and Practical Center of Preventive and Clinical Medicine\" State Administration Department.

      "abstract": "With the development of the Industrial Internet of Things, drones have been applied to many application scenarios for providing reliable communication services. However, due to being deployed in an open environment, drones often suffer from impersonation attacks, posing significant threats to flight safety. Therefore, designing an effective pilot identification scheme is crucial for the safe flight of drones. Currently, some pioneer works have been devoted to pilot identification. Limited by the insufficient training samples, the performance of pilot identification still needs to be improved. For this reason, a novel generative adversarial network (GAN)based drone pilot identification scheme named DP-GAN has been proposed to improve pilot identification performance. Specifically, we first construct a long short-term memory (LSTM)-based generator to estimate the distribution of the collected dataset and then utilize the temporal and spatial relationships among the received control commands and drone attitudes to produce realistic flight data. Moreover, we also designed a three-stage adversarial training strategy to optimize the generator and discriminator simultaneously. Since the well-constructed generator could produce realistic flight data, the pilot identification performance of the discriminator could be further enhanced. After being verified by systematic experiments, the proposed scheme has achieved 94.42% and 97.02% accuracy under natural and constrained environments on S500. Thanks to the lightweight system overhead, this scheme holds the potential to be deployed on the drone platform for real-time pilot identification. \u00c2\u00a9 2023 Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc..

      "abstract": "The characteristics of connected automated vehicles (CAVs) make them more susceptible to various cyberattacks, resulting in traffic congestion, delays, and even serious traffic accidents. In recent years, the safety issues of CAVs have become a hot research topic. The current research mostly focuses on studying and evaluating the impact of cyberattacks on the car-following behavior of single lane vehicles. However, lane changing behavior is also one of the most common traffic behaviors on the road, and compared to car-following behavior, lane changing is more complex, vehicles are more likely to collide with surrounding vehicles, and traffic accidents are more likely to occur. Therefore, it is necessary to explore the impact of cyberattacks on vehicles in lane changing environments. The purpose of this study is to investigate the effect of cyberattacks on the lane-changing behavior of two-lane vehicles and evaluate the security. First, this study establishes a framework for dynamics under cyberattacks by combining the intelligent driver model (IDM) and the minimizing overall braking induced by lane changes (MOBIL) model. Then, the traffic effects of different severity of attacks on the vehicle are simulated under three attack scenarios (bogus information, replay/delay and collusion cyberattacks), respectively. Finally, we use the conflict measures to analyze the collision risk of various cyberattacks, including time-to-collision (TTC), time-integrated time-to-collision (TIT) and the standard deviation (SD) of velocity. The simulation results indicate that different cyberattacks may cause changes in lane-changing time and refuse to change lanes. In addition, the CAV platoon of two lanes will lead to varying degrees of speed oscillations and collision risks. Among these, collusion attacks cause the most serious damage. These findings help to better understand the impact of cyberattacks on CAVs and lay the foundation for enhanced cybersecurity. \u00c2\u00a9 2023 Elsevier B.V.",

      "abstract": "The advent of unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) swarm technology brings possibilities to help humans complete tasks in no man's land, such as deserts and rainforests. However, UAV network faces many cyber threats, where attackers can impersonate legitimate entities or tamper with UAV task data. For identity security, most of the existing methods use centralized authentication schemes, which have a single point of failure problem. For data security, the existing methods only secure the task data in the ground system, ignoring the data security in the air network. Therefore, the existing methods are not suitable for ubiquitous UAV scenarios. Blockchain secures data security while eliminating the single point of failure problem, and has been widely used in distributed scenarios. In this article, to secure entity identity and task data, we propose a blockchain-supported secure multi-UAV task management scheme (B-UAVM). Specifically, a three-layer blockchain structure is constructed to secure multitasks, and achieve ubiquitous control of UAV formations. Besides, six types of blocks and three types of transactions are designed to achieve safe processing and storage of task data and entity information. Furthermore, an improved practical byzantine fault tolerance (IPBFT) consensus mechanism and a UAV-formation-action-considered ground station consensus mechanism (UFAGS) are introduced in the Server Network and Ground Control Network, respectively, to accelerate the consensus. The experimental results show that the number of transactions generated per second (TPS) of B-UAVM is about 0.5\u00c3\u0097 and 3.7\u00c3\u0097 of the existing method when the block size or the number of blockchain nodes increases, respectively. \u00c2\u00a9 2014 IEEE.",

Industry 4.0 also elaborates on decentralized decision-making in the form of Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS) and Cyber-Physical Production Systems (CPPS). Material handling is crucial, where numerous heterogeneous stakeholders collaborate to fulfill customer orders. Manufacturing enterprises utilize Automated Guided Vehicles (AGVs) to manage material handling based on a centralized decision-making process. Nowadays, Autonomous Mobile Robots (AMRs) are being introduced based on a decentralized decision-making process to increase material handling efficiency. The centralized and decentralized decision-making processes have pros and cons, which need to be suitably exploited when addressing problems. The current article looks into Finished Goods (FG) handling employing AMRs. There are multiple interdependent challenges in scheduling and real-time control of AMRs. These challenges need to be viewed from a holistic perspective and through the lens of centralized and decentralized decision-making processes. A literature review on the decision-making process is presented, considering the FG warehouse scenario. Furthermore, a methodology is proposed to realize a balanced approach to the decision-making process. \u00c2\u00a9 2023 American Institute of Physics Inc.. All rights reserved.",

      "abstract": "Unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) trajectory planning plays an essential role in agricultural production and biological control. To solve the agricultural UAV trajectory planning problem, a multi-mechanism collaborative improved grey wolf optimization algorithm (NAS-GWO) is proposed. In NAS-GWO, the evolutionary boundary constraint processing mechanism is introduced to update the position of the grey wolf individuals that cross the boundary in time to retain the position information of the optimal individuals to the largest degree to enhance the search accuracy of the algorithm. Then, the Gaussian mutation strategy and spiral function are used as perturbation mechanisms to help the algorithm jump out of the local optimum in time to strengthen the exploitation capability of NAS-GWO. Meanwhile, the improved Sigmoid function is used as a nonlinear convergence factor for balancing the exploitation and exploration of the NAS-GWO. By comparing NAS-GWO with ten advanced metaheuristic algorithms on 20 CEC2017 benchmark functions, the experimental results show that the NAS-GWO algorithm has superior merit seeking and robustness. Moreover, the agricultural UAV trajectory planning problem is solved using NAS-GWO. The experimental results show that the NAS-GWO algorithm plans a more viable and stable trajectory path in four different scale missions, while the most important is that it requires less cost. Among them, the algorithm reduces 27.93%, 38.15%, 32.32%, 34.11%, 10.63%, and 13.48% on average in cost function values compared to Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO), Whale Optimization Algorithm (WOA), Aquila Optimizer (AO), Differential Evolution (DE), Dung Beetle Optimizer (DBO), and Grey Wolf Optimization algorithm (GWO), thus proving the effectiveness and significance of NAS-GWO in the agricultural UAV trajectory path planning problem. \u00c2\u00a9 2023 Elsevier Ltd",

      "abstract": "Imaging plays a fundamental role in the effective diagnosis, staging, management, and monitoring of various cardiac pathologies. Successful radiological analysis relies on accurate image segmentation, a technically arduous process, prone to human-error. To overcome the laborious and time-consuming nature of cardiac image analysis, deep learning approaches have been developed, enabling the accurate, time-efficient, and highly personalised diagnosis, staging and management of cardiac pathologies. Here, we present a review of over 60 papers, proposing deep learning models for cardiac image segmentation. We summarise the theoretical basis of Convolutional Neural Networks, Fully Convolutional Neural Networks, U-Net, V-Net, No-New-U-Net (nnU-Net), Transformer Networks, DeepLab, Generative Adversarial Networks, Auto Encoders and Recurrent Neural Networks. In addition, we identify pertinent performance-enhancing measures including adaptive convolutional kernels, atrous convolutions, attention gates, and deep supervision modules. Top-performing models in ventricular, myocardial, atrial and aortic segmentation are explored, highlighting U-Net and nnU-Net-based model architectures achieving state-of-the art segmentation accuracies. Additionally, key gaps in the current research and technology are identified, and areas of future research are suggested, aiming to guide the innovation and clinical adoption of automated cardiac segmentation methods. \u00c2\u00a9 2023",

      "abstract": "Construction waste sorting (CWS) is highly recommended as a key step for construction waste management. However, current CWS involves humans\u00e2\u0080\u0099 manual hand-picking, which poses significant threats to their occupational safety and health (OSH). Robotic sorting promises to change the situation by adopting modern artificial intelligence and automation technologies. However, in practice, it is usually challenging for robots to do an efficient job (e.g., measured by quickness and accuracy) owing to the difficulties in precisely recognizing compositions of the mixed and heterogeneous waste stream. Leveraging augmented reality (AR) as a communication interface, this research aims to develop a human-robot collaboration (HRC) approach to address the dilemmatic balance between CWS efficiency and OSH. Firstly, a model for human-robot collaborative sorting using AR is established. Then, a prototype for the AR-enable collaborative sorting system is developed and evaluated. The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed AR-enabled HRC method can improve the accuracy rate of CWS by 10% and 15% for sorting isolated waste and obscured waste, respectively, when compared to the method without human involvement. Interview results indicate a significant improvement in OSH, especially the reduction of contamination risks and machinery risks. The research lays out a human-robot collaborative paradigm for productive and safe CWS via an immersive and interactive interface like AR. \u00c2\u00a9 2023 Elsevier Ltd",

      "abstract": "Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) are being employed more frequently for defense and civilian applications these days. Despite the fact that modern technology has many advantages, it also creates new business and industrial challenges. Current laws and regulations cannot be applied to UAV\u00e2\u0080\u0099s due to the fact as they are not required to use in existing infrastructure. Even in dire circumstances, UAV\u00e2\u0080\u0099s may quickly overcome physical obstacles and pose a threat to society. Hence, the present manuscript focused on creating a Drone Protection System (DPS). In India over the past ten years, the use of drones for both military and civilian purposes have been evaluated. To mitigate the dangers posed by UAVs, counter-drone technologies are also being put together in the interim. This paper examines the aforementionedproblem and provides suggestions to reduce the growing threat posed by drones. Moreover, modern technologies like artificial intelligence (AI), cognitive global positioning system avoidance, and hardware application security must be considered when evaluating the efficiency of anti-drone systems. A prototype for the Anti-Drone UAV system that can capture potentially dangerous UAV\u00e2\u0080\u0099s in the air is presented in this paper. The aim of the present work includes the state of the art anti-drone capture mechanism with various existing ways to halt unidentified drones, and also to determine the best method for slicing the target in half. With the first preliminary observation, a simplified Net gun is modeled and affixed with the Anti-Drone Quad copter, and successfully deployed for capturing the UAV\u00e2\u0080\u0099s. The obtained results and the present concept may be used to further develop a swarm mechanism for national aerial defense as a future work. \u00c2\u00a9 2023 American Institute of Physics Inc..

We address this very large-scale problem using a greedy insertion heuristic. Accompanying this heuristic, we propose a filtering system to speed up routing process. The approach includes two specific data structures used as filtering devices, three different filtering modules, and a halt mechanism to control the computation effort spent in exploring the search space for candidate vehicles. The approach also relies on an original route encoding that exploits the topology of the road network. Experimental results show that en-route vehicles can be significantly reduced in such a system, decreasing the vehicle number by more than .

      "abstract": "Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) are essential in sixth-generation (6G) networks as they can operate as data relay devices or even a dynamic base station between the source and the destination. In this paper, we study a radio communication system with the support of the UAV to cope with the harsh propagation environment. Besides, caching and backscatter technologies are exploited to boost network efficiency. Specifically, the caching technology reduces network propagation delay, while the backscatter technology provides energy transmitted by the source to the UAV to extend its lifetime. We design the UAV trajectory by formulating and solving the total data throughput at the destination over a time window with respect to the limited energy and the quality of service requirement. The effective algorithm is based on the back-tracking method, which can obtain the solution in polynomial time. Numerical results demonstrate an improvement of the sum data throughput by exploiting the proposed algorithm design compared with the different fixed UAV path planning benchmarks. \u00c2\u00a9 2023 ACM.",

      "abstract": "The United Nations Economic Commission for Europe (UNECE) demands the management of cyber security risks in vehicle design and that the effectiveness of these measures is verified by testing. Generally, with rising complexity and openness of systems via software-defined vehicles, verification through testing becomes a very important for security assurance. This mandates the introduction of industrial-grade cybersecurity testing in automotive development processes. Currently, the automotive cybersecurity testing procedures are not specified or automated enough to be able to deliver tests in the amount and thoroughness needed to keep up with that regulation, let alone doing so in a cost-efficient manner. This paper presents a methodology to automatically generate technology-agnostic test scenarios from the results of threat analysis and risk assessment (TARA) process. Our approach is to transfer the resulting threat models into attack trees and label their edges using actions from a domain-specific language (DSL) for attack descriptions. This results in a labelled transitions system (LTS), in which every labelled path intrinsically forms a test scenario. In addition, we include the concept of Cybersecurity Assurance Levels (CALs) and Targeted Attack Feasibility (TAF) into testing by assigning them as costs to the attack path. This abstract test scenario can be compiled into a concrete test case by augmenting it with implementation details. Therefore, the efficacy of the measures taken because of the TARA can be verified and documented. As TARA is a de-facto mandatory step in the UNECE regulation and the relevant ISO standard, automatic test generation (also mandatory) out of it could mean a significant improvement in efficiency, as two steps could be done at once. \u00c2\u00a9 2023 ACM.",

      "abstract": "The advent of autonomous vehicles continuously fosters innovative concepts in the context of smart cities. One such concept is the City Bot infrastructure, where an autonomous and modular vehicle fleet can be configured depending on the tasks, required by the smart city. The dynamic task adaptation is enabled by splitting the vehicle into a tractor module, which performs the autonomous driving functionality, and a trailer module, which contains the task-specific equipment. A backend can assign tasks to the vehicles, which then autonomously fulfill their given tasks. The modular design and autonomous task handling, however, give rise to new security threats. This paper performs a security analysis of an autonomous and modular vehicle fleet, which autonomously handles tasks assigned by a backend. We then discuss how the identified risks can be addressed by (1) using state-of-the-art automotive security mechanisms, (2) designing tailored concepts or (3) highlighting potential for future research directions. \u00c2\u00a9 2023 ACM.",

      "abstract": "Neural networks are an increasingly common tool for solving problems that require complex analysis and pattern matching, such as identifying stop signs in a self driving car or processing medical imagery during diagnosis. Accordingly, verification of neural networks for safety and correctness is of great importance, as mispredictions can have catastrophic results in safety critical domains. As neural networks are known to be sensitive to small changes in input, leading to vulnerabilities and adversarial attacks, analyzing the robustness of networks to small changes in input is a key piece of evaluating their safety and correctness. However, there are many real-world scenarios where the requirements of robustness are not clear cut, and it is crucial to develop measures that assess the level of robustness of a given neural network model and compare levels of robustness across different models, rather than using a binary characterization such as robust vs. not robust. We believe there is great need for developing scalable quantitative robustness verification techniques for neural networks. Formal verification techniques can provide guarantees of correctness, but most existing approaches do not provide quantitative robustness measures and are not effective in analyzing real-world network sizes. On the other hand, sampling-based quantitative robustness is not hindered much by the size of networks but cannot provide sound guarantees of quantitative results. We believe more research is needed to address the limitations of both symbolic and sampling-based verification approaches and create sound, scalable techniques for quantitative robustness verification of neural networks. \u00c2\u00a9 2023 Owner/Author.",

This study focuses on the open-source domain for photogrammetry and is trying to provide a walkthrough for the recent developments in extracting 3D information from 2D images with the context of point clouds. Four different free and open-source software (VisualSFM, WebODM, Colmap, Meshroom) were studied from the perspective of their point cloud generation capability and photogrammetric workflow to provide a comparative assessment in this research. Each software is also assessed for their usability and workflow functions. UAV-based photographs were acquired for the study area and using the same datasets and default parameters in each software, dense photogrammetric point clouds were generated using their own photogrammetric workflow. For each of these dense point clouds, an assessment of their quality and enriched information based on some robust parameters is done.",

The main objective of this study was to show how augmenting the situational awareness of traffic signal controllers, using observations from moving sensor platforms, can enable prioritization of cyclists and reduce lost time within the control cycle in an effective way. We investigated the potential of using observations from connected autonomous vehicles (CAVs) as a source of new information, using a revised vehicle-actuated controller. This controller exploits CAV-generated observations of cyclists to optimize the control for cyclists. The results from a simulation study indicated that with a low CAV penetration rate, prioritizing cyclists by tracking reduced cyclist delays and stops, even with a small field of view. As the delay of car directions were not taken into account in this study, the average car delay increased considerably with an increasing number of cyclists. Future work is needed to optimize the control that balances the delays and stops of cyclists and cars. \u00c2\u00a9 National Academy of Sciences: Transportation Research Board 2023.",

      "abstract": "Objectives: Asymptomatic gastrointestinal carriage of carbapenem-resistant Enterobacteriaceae (CRE) is a threat to global health in developing countries with inadequate safe drinking water, poor hygiene, and weak antimicrobial stewardship; however, epidemiological data to guide CRE infection prevention and control is limited in these settings. We assessed asymptomatic CRE and carbapenem-producing Enterobacteriaceae (CPE) fecal carriage rates and associated risk factors among hospitalized children aged under 5 years. Methods: We adopted a cross-sectional study at Mama Lucy Kibaki Hospital in Nairobi-City County, Kenya, between June and September 2022. We collected demographic and clinical characteristics using a structured questionnaire and clinical reports and analyzed stool/rectal swab samples by standard and automated bacteriological methods. Results: Asymptomatic CRE and CPE fecal carriage rate was 2.25% (6/267), with six isolates recovered, predominated by Escherichia coli (33.33%) and Enterobacter cloacae subsp dissolvens (33.33%). Third-generation cephalosporin and ciprofloxacin resistance were highest in Citrobacter farmer and E. cloacae subsp cloacae. All CRE and CPE were multidrug-resistant, and except E. cloacae subsp cloacae, were 100% colistin-resistant. Conclusions: Asymptomatic gastrointestinal carriage of multidrug-resistant-CRE among hospitalized children under 5 years, presents a substantial public health threat. This calls for continuous surveillance including molecular characterization of isolates, to inform infection prevention and antimicrobial stewardship adherence in line with local and global plans on AMR. \u00c2\u00a9 2023 The Authors",

      "abstract": "Weed control is a basic agricultural practice, typically achieved through herbicides and mechanical weeders. Because of the negative environmental impacts of these tools, alternative solutions are being developed and adopted worldwide. Following recent technical developments, an autonomous laser-based weeding system (ALWS) now offers a possible solution for sustainable weed control. However, beyond recent proof of performance, little is known about the adoption potential of such a system. This study assesses the adoption potential of ALWS, using a mixed-method approach. First, six macro-environmental factors regarding the adoption of ALWS were determined. This assessment is referred to as a Political, Economic, Social, Technological, Legal, Environmental (PESTLE) analysis and is conducted in a form of a literature review initiated by expert consultations. Second, a range of European stakeholders\u2019 perceptions of ALWS was evaluated in four focus-group discussions (n\u2009=\u200955), using a strengths, weaknesses, opportunities, threats (SWOT) analysis. The factors identified in the PESTLE and SWOT analyses were subsequently merged to provide a comprehensive overview of the adoption potential of ALWS. Labour reduction, precision treatment and environmental sustainability were found to be the most important advantages of ALWS. High costs and performance uncertainty were identified as the main weaknesses. To promote the adoption of ALWS, this study recommends the following: (1) Concrete performance results, both technical and economic, should be communicated to farmers. (2) Farmers\u2019 knowledge of precision agriculture should be improved. (3) Advantage should be taken of policies that are favourable towards non-chemical methods and the high demand for organic products. This article also extensively discusses regulatory barriers, the risks posed to the safety of both humans and the machines involved, technological challenges and requirements, and policy recommendations related to ALWS adoption.",

      "abstract": "This paper studies simultaneous search and monitoring (SSM) between multiple unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) and multiple moving ground targets. Searching for unknown targets and monitoring known ones are two intrinsically related problems, but they have mostly been addressed in isolation. We combine the two tasks and exploit their interconnection as a synergy rather than a trade-off. We construct the single-robot SSM as a partially observable Markov decision process (POMDP) and the multi-robot SSM as a semi-decentralised POMDP (semi-Dec-POMDP). A novel heuristic reactive policy planning is proposed to solve the POMDP. It is then extended for semi-Dec-POMDP with game-theoretical methods. In simulations and experiments, the searchers will successfully locate unknown targets without losing known ones and cooperate by partitioning their tasks. With theoretical proofs, simulations, and experiments, we demonstrate that our method can perform better than conventional approaches and the state-of-the-art. \u00c2\u00a9 2023 Elsevier B.V.",

      "abstract": "As the automotive industry has progressed in recent years, in-vehicle networks have also changed. In contrast to traditional vehicles, modern vehicles communicate through connecting interfaces, Electronic Control Units (ECUs), sensors, and gateways over different communication channels called buses. While LIN, CAN, FlexRay, MOST, and Automotive Ethernet protocols facilitate vehicle communication, they expose vehicles to various security risks. Electronics in vehicles must be advanced to improve passenger safety, comfort, and vehicle performance. However, security issues must also be addressed to ensure vehicle resilience. This paper presents an in-depth and comprehensive analysis of the security issues associated with in-vehicle network protocols. We examine the feasibility, severity, and potential consequences of these security issues, which can be used to better understand the risks and vulnerabilities within in-vehicle networks. Furthermore, the paper examines existing solutions that aim to mitigate the identified attacks, including intrusion detection systems (IDSs), firewalls, authentication, and schedulers, while evaluating their effectiveness and drawbacks. Hence, we enable automotive security engineers to comprehend the current state of security measures used to protect in-vehicle networks and identify areas where further research is needed to develop more effective and tailored security solutions. Finally, the paper provides recommendations for future research and the development of security solutions that researchers can use to guide their research efforts for in-vehicle network security. \u00c2\u00a9 2023 Elsevier Inc.",

      "abstract": "Mobile robots are increasingly employed in today\u2019s environment. Perceiving the environment to perform a task plays a major role in the robots. The service robots are wisely employed in the fully (or) partially known user\u2019s environment. The exploration and exploitation of the unknown environment is a tedious task. This paper introduces a novel Trimmed Q-learning algorithm to predict interesting scenes via efficient memorability-oriented robotic behavioral scene activity training. The training process involves three stages: online learning and short-term and long-term learning modules. It is helpful for autonomous exploration and making wiser decisions about the environment. A simplified three-stage learning framework is introduced to train and predict interesting scenes using memorability. A proficient visual memory schema (VMS) is designed to tune the learning parameters. A role-based profile arrangement is made to explore the unknown environment for a long-term learning process. The online and short-term learning frameworks are designed using a novel Trimmed Q-learning algorithm. The underestimated bias in robotic actions must be minimized by introducing a refined set of practical candidate actions. Finally, the recalling ability of each learning module is estimated to predict the interesting scenes. Experiments conducted on public datasets, SubT, and SUN databases demonstrate the proposed technique\u2019s efficacy. The proposed framework has yielded better memorability scores in short-term and online learning at 72.84% and in long-term learning at 68.63%.",

      "abstract": "Unmanned Aerial Vehicles UAVs have revolutionized a wide range of activities and businesses, creating new opportunities for commercial and military applications. However, they also pose potential risks for terrorist and criminal activities. Therefore, researchers have been examining potential drone threats and considering how to address security and privacy concerns related to this technology. This research topic has gained significant attention in recent years due to the rapid proliferation of commercial and recreational drones, as well as the associated risks to airspace safety and security. Various detection technologies have been developed, including radar, optical, and acoustic sensing systems. However, each detector has its own limitations, such as reduced effectiveness in low-light conditions, fog, and noise. To address these limitations, we have developed a drone detection technique that utilizes multiple detectors, including visual, acoustic, and magnetic field sensors applying artificial intelligence, to compensate for their shortcomings. In this approach, each detector makes an independent decision, which may be either consistent or conflicting with the other detectors. In our study, we employed the Bayesian Inference technique to optimize decision-making in cases where there was conflict among the decisions made by the multi-sensors. We used indicators such as the Ephemeris indicator (EI) and the Acoustic ambiance indicator (AI) to generate settings to determine the degree of conflict. The drone detection process was fully automated, and the conflict decision was optimized using this approach. Our results indicated that the automatic drone detection with Bayesian inference had the best performance for drone identification in terms of accuracy, specificity, and sensitivity, as well as the highest accuracy in preventing unwanted drone interventions.",

      "abstract": "For many coupled dynamical systems, the interaction is the outcome of the measurement that each unit has of the others as e.g. in modern inverter-based power grids, autonomous vehicular platoons or swarms of drones, or it is the result of physical flows. Synchronization among all the components of these systems is of primal importance to avoid failures. The overall operational state of these systems therefore crucially depends on the correct and reliable functioning of the individual elements as well as the information they transmit through the network. Here, we investigate the effect of Byzantine attacks where one unit does not behave as expected, but is controlled by an external attacker. For such attacks, we assess the impact on the global collective behavior of nonlinearly coupled phase oscillators. We relate the synchronization error induced by the input signal to the properties of the attacked node. This allows to anticipate the potential of an attacker and identify which network components to secure. \u00c2\u00a9 2023 The Author(s). Published by IOP Publishing Ltd.",

      "abstract": "Unmanned aerial vehicles offer services such as military reconnaissance in potentially adversarial controlled regions. In addition, they have been deployed in civilian critical infrastructure monitoring. In this environment, real-time and massive data is exchanged between the aerial vehicles and the ground control stations. Depending on the mission of these aerial vehicles, some of the collected and transmitted data is sensitive and private. Therefore, many security protocols have been presented to offer privacy and security protection. However, majority of these schemes fail to consider attack vectors such as side-channeling, de-synchronization and known secret session temporary information leakages. This last attack can be launched upon adversarial physical capture of these drones. In addition, some of these protocols deploy computationally intensive asymmetric cryptographic primitives that result in high overheads. In this paper, an authentication protocol based on lightweight quadratic residues and hash functions is developed. Its formal security analysis is executed using the widely deployed random oracle model. In addition, informal security analysis is carried out to show its robustness under the Dolev\u00e2\u0080\u0093Yao (DY) and Canetti\u00e2\u0080\u0093Krawczyk (CK) threat models. In terms of operational efficiency, it is shown to have relatively lower execution time, communication costs, and incurs the least storage costs among other related protocols. Specifically, the proposed protocol provides a 25% improvement in supported security and privacy features and a 6.52% reduction in storage costs. In overall, the proposed methodology offers strong security and privacy protection at lower execution time, storage and communication overheads. \u00c2\u00a9 2023 The Author(s)",

      "abstract": "Precision agriculture and Smart farming have become the essential backbone for sustainable agricultural production by leveraging cutting edge remote sensing and communication technologies, meshed with AI driven data processing and decision making approaches. Agricultural segments, such as crop and livestock monitoring, crop/plant classification, yield prediction, weed detection, automatic harvesting, early detection, and prevention of diseases are being served for efficient, cost-effective process monitoring with increased profitability. With the remarkable development in recent decades, Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAV) based remote sensing technologies have gained rapid proliferation and exploitation in precision agriculture. Consequently, over the past decades, researchers have explored the capabilities of UAVs for real-time imagery data acquisition and processing through powerful Deep Learning (DL) algorithms to optimize agricultural process management. Being a prevalent research domain of high-tech field with constant advancement, there is a need for systematic review to recapitulate the contemporary literature and reveal the domain's intellectual structure. This systematic literature review (SLR) research has methodically scrutinized 214 peer reviewed articles on the concerned domain that are published in ranked journals and conferences over the past 14 years. Several pressing dimensions are investigated, including, the feasibility assessment of the UAVs in precision agriculture, determine the impact of imaging modalities and imagery datasets in relation to agricultural applications, categorically evaluate the UAV configuration and offer detailed scrutiny of AI methods in relation to real-time control, decision making and action performance in agricultural applications. Alongside, the taxonomy of crops across the world is documented for which UAV is utilized. Finally, the main challenges and directions of future research along the track is presented. \u00c2\u00a9 2023",

      "abstract": "Many existing advanced deep learning-based autonomous systems have recently been used for autonomous vehicles. In general, a deep learning-based visual perception system heavily relies on visual perception to recognize and localize dynamic interest objects (e.g., pedestrians and cars) and indicative traffic signs and lights to assist autonomous vehicles in maneuvering safely. However, the performance of existing object recognition algorithms could degrade significantly under some adverse and challenging scenarios including rainy, foggy, and rainy night conditions. The raindrops, light reflection, and low illumination pose a great challenge to robust object recognition. Thus, A robust and accurate autonomous driving system has attracted growing attention from the computer vision community. To achieve robust and accurate visual perception, we target to build effective and efficient augmentation and fusion techniques based on visual perception under various adverse conditions. The unpaired image-to-image (I2I) synthesis is integrated for visual perception enhancement and effective synthesis-based augmentation. Besides, we design a two-branch architecture to utilize the information from both the original image and the enhanced image synthesized by I2I. We comprehensively and hierarchically investigate the performance improvement and limitation of the proposed system based on visual recognition tasks and network backbones. An extensive experimental analysis of various adverse weather conditions is also included. The experimental results have demonstrated the proposed system could promote the ability of autonomous vehicles for robust and accurate perception under adverse weather conditions. \u00c2\u00a9 2000-2011 IEEE.",

      "abstract": "We address multi-robot geometric task-and-motion planning (MR-GTAMP) problems in synchronous, monotone setups. The goal of the MR-GTAMP problem is to move objects with multiple robots to goal regions in the presence of other movable objects. We focus on collaborative manipulation tasks where the robots have to adopt intelligent collaboration strategies to be successful and effective, i.e., decide which robot should move which objects to which positions, and perform collaborative actions, such as handovers. To endow robots with these collaboration capabilities, we propose to first collect occlusion and reachability information for each robot by calling motion-planning algorithms. We then propose a method that uses the collected information to build a graph structure which captures the precedence of the manipulations of different objects and supports the implementation of a mixed-integer program to guide the search for highly effective collaborative task-and-motion plans. The search process for collaborative task-and-motion plans is based on a Monte-Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) exploration strategy to achieve exploration-exploitation balance. We evaluate our framework in two challenging MR-GTAMP domains and show that it outperforms two state-of-the-art baselines with respect to the planning time, the resulting plan length and the number of objects moved. We also show that our framework can be applied to underground mining operations where a robotic arm needs to coordinate with an autonomous roof bolter. We demonstrate plan execution in two roof-bolting scenarios both in simulation and on robots.",

      "abstract": "Parameters, such as left ventricular ejection fraction, peak strain dispersion, global longitudinal strain, etc. are influential and clinically interpretable for detection of cardiac disease, while manual detection requires laborious steps and expertise. In this study, we evaluated a video-based deep learning method that merely depends on echocardiographic videos from four apical chamber views of hypertensive cardiomyopathy detection. One hundred eighty-five hypertensive cardiomyopathy (HTCM) patients and 112 healthy normal controls (N) were enrolled in this diagnostic study. We collected 297 de-identified subjects\u2019 echo videos for training and testing of an end-to-end video-based pipeline of snippet proposal, snippet feature extraction by a three-dimensional (3-D) convolutional neural network (CNN), a weakly-supervised temporally correlated feature ensemble, and a final classification module. The snippet proposal step requires a preliminarily trained end-systole and end-diastole timing detection model to produce snippets that begin at end-diastole, and involve contraction and dilatation for a complete cardiac cycle. A domain adversarial neural network was introduced to systematically address the appearance variability of echo videos in terms of noise, blur, transducer depth, contrast, etc. to improve the generalization of deep learning algorithms. In contrast to previous image-based cardiac disease detection architectures, video-based approaches integrate spatial and temporal information better with a more powerful 3D convolutional operator. Our proposed model achieved accuracy (ACC) of 92%, area under receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve (AUC) of 0.90, sensitivity(SEN) of 97%, and specificity (SPE) of 84% with respect to subjects for hypertensive cardiomyopathy detection in the test data set, and outperformed the corresponding 3D CNN (vanilla I3D: ACC (0.90), AUC (0.89), SEN (0.94), and SPE (0.84)). On the whole, the video-based methods remarkably appeared superior to the image-based methods, while few evaluation metrics of image-based methods exhibited to be more compelling (sensitivity of 93% and negative predictive value of 100% for the image-based methods (ES/ED and random)). The results supported the possibility of using end-to-end video-based deep learning method for the automated diagnosis of hypertensive cardiomyopathy in the field of echocardiography to augment and assist clinicians.

      "abstract": "As robots acquire increasingly sophisticated skills and see increasingly complex and varied environments, the threat of an edge case or anomalous failure is ever present. For example, Tesla cars have seen interesting failure modes ranging from autopilot disengagements due to inactive traffic lights carried by trucks to phantom braking caused by images of stop signs on roadside billboards. These system-level failures are not due to failures of any individual component of the autonomy stack but rather system-level deficiencies in semantic reasoning. Such edge cases, which we call semantic anomalies, are simple for a human to disentangle yet require insightful reasoning. To this end, we study the application of large language models (LLMs), endowed with broad contextual understanding and reasoning capabilities, to recognize such edge cases and introduce a monitoring framework for semantic anomaly detection in vision-based policies. Our experiments apply this framework to a finite state machine policy for autonomous driving and a learned policy for object manipulation. These experiments demonstrate that the LLM-based monitor can effectively identify semantic anomalies in a manner that shows agreement with human reasoning. Finally, we provide an extended discussion on the strengths and weaknesses of this approach and motivate a research outlook on how we can further use foundation models for semantic anomaly detection.

      "abstract": "The rapid evolution of vehicle-to-vehicle and vehicle-to-infrastructure communication opens doors to various control algorithms, one particular domain being intersection control. Several researchers have proposed communication-based intersection control algorithms omitting traditional traffic lights with the promise of enhanced throughput and improved traffic safety. On the other hand, the majority of these algorithms ignore the uncertainties and delays of communication and overlook new cyberattack vectors that are opened by connected traffic. The present study employs a highly detailed simulation of vehicular communication to highlight the sensitivity of different autonomous intersection control algorithms (both centralized and decentralized) to communication-related imperfections. The paper investigates five different algorithms borrowed from the literature in a comparative way. This research focuses on traffic-related parameters such as average speed, occupancy, and network throughput while also analyzing communication-related parameters (e.g., packet loss, computational demand) and considering possible attack vectors. Simulation results suggest that even the simplest control logic is sensitive to communication failures, degrading intersection throughput below traditional intersection control or even compromising traffic safety. For centralized algorithms, in the presence of noise, average speeds drop significantly, suggesting reduced intersection throughput and even gridlock for the First Come First Serve algorithm. Decentralized algorithms can be heavily affected by incoming message orders, which can lead to dangerous situations. During the simulations, multiple collisions were registered for the Monte-Carlo Tree Search algorithm. More complex algorithms that rely on accurate prediction on vehicle trajectories are more sensitive to noise and even produce accidents in the simulation. In conclusion, regardless of control architecture, the evaluated algorithms require additional fallback solutions and redundancies to retain traffic safety. \u00c2\u00a9 2023 The Author(s)",

      "abstract": "The archaeological site of Palaiokastro (Old Navarino castle), is located in Messenia on the Coryphasium peninsula, at the southern end of the beach of Voidokoilia in the Navarino Bay, SW Peloponnese. Palaiokastro was built during Frankish rule of the Peloponnese, in the 13th century, over the classical Acropolis of Pylos. The aim of this study is the initial documentation of the current situation of the medieval castle of Palaiokastro applying innovative technology including terrestrial laser scanner (TLS) and unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs). TLS and UAV photogrammetry have been used in an integrated design to rapidly facilitate the acquisition of the whole gate, eliminating all possible occlusions. TLS was exploited for the acquisition of the facades while the UAV was used to capture the top view of castle gate. The recent improvement of the post-processing algorithms provides us with the ability to implement fusion methods of TLS and UAV models and also deliver an accurate 3D model of the whole gate. The combination of photogrammetry from the UAV with the data of the terrestrial laser scanner was used in order to give us a multitude of products such as textured 3D model, orthophotos, 2D floor plans, elevations and sections which are necessary for the complete and accurate geometric documentation of the current situation of the Southwest gate of Palaiokastro Castle. The various products mentioned assist in the better management of the study data and identification of the different construction phases of the South Gate. \u00c2\u00a9 2023 Elsevier Ltd",

      "abstract": "I analyze the impact of industrial robots on the employment of natives and immigrants in US local labor markets between 1990 and 2014. The proposed mechanism, through which robot adoption affects the employment of natives and immigrants differentially, is based on two facts: first, robots tend to displace workers based on the task content of occupations, and second, natives and immigrants in the US differ in their task specialization. Therefore, robots should affect their employment unequally. Exploiting plausibly exogenous variation in robot exposure across US local labor markets over time, I test this mechanism and find that the effect on immigrants is roughly 1.76 times greater than that observed for natives. Specifically, I find that one more robot per thousand workers reduces the employment-to-population ratio of natives and immigrants by 0.38 and 0.67 percentage points, respectively. I attribute these results to the fact that immigrants specialize in jobs or tasks at risk of being automated. \u00c2\u00a9 2023 The Author",

      "abstract": "Pine shoot beetle (PSB) is one of the most damaging forest insects of Yunnan pine plantations in southwest China. However, the subtle symptoms of heterogeneous tree crowns make it difficult to accurately detect at early stage of PSB attack. Here, we evaluated the potential of a combination of plant traits (PTs) and vegetation indices (VIs) to distinguish different levels of tree damage by integrating hyperspectral, thermal imagery, and light detection and ranging (lidar) data based on unmanned airborne vehicle (UAV) systems. A voxelization method was used to fuse hyperspectral reflectance, temperature, and lidar point cloud data. Subsequently, PTs such as pigments (i.e., chlorophyll, carotenoid, and anthocyanin contents) were retrieved from a radiative transfer model inversion, and structural, fluorescence, and thermal traits, as well as VIs, were derived from the fusion data. We developed a novel analytical approach using random forest (RF) algorithm with predictors from different spatial distributions (i.e., horizontal directions, vertical layers, and vertical clusters) to compare the performance of tree severity classification. The results showed that the difference of both PTs and VIs in vertical layers between different severity levels are more than that in horizontal directions. The performance of RF model with predictors of the vertical layers (OA = 74 %, kappa = 0.65) was better than that using the predictive variables in horizontal directions (OA = 69 % and kappa = 0.60) of tree crowns. Using the vertical clustering features RF model increased the accuracy (OA = 78 % and kappa = 0.70), especially for slightly and moderately damaged trees, with improvements of 10 % and 12 %, respectively. Among all variables analyzed, chlorophylls were the most important predictor, followed by photochemical reflectance index and structural traits. Our work demonstrates the effectiveness of using fused UAV-based multi-sensor data for early detection of PSB attack, and can be applied other potential forest diseases and insect monitoring. \u00c2\u00a9 2023 The Author(s)",

      "abstract": "Correlation filter-based trackers have made significant progress in visual object tracking for various types of unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) applications due to their promising performance and efficiency. However, the boundary effect remains a challenging problem. Several methods enlarge search areas to handle this shortcoming but introduce more background noise, and the filter is prone to learn from distractors. To address this issue, we present spatial regularized correlation filters with response consistency and distractor repression. Specifically, a temporal constraint is introduced to reinforce the consistency across frames by minimizing the difference between consecutive correlation response maps. A dynamic spatial constraint is also integrated by exploiting the local maximum points of the correlation response produced during the detection phase to mitigate the interference from background distractions. The proposed appearance model can optimize the temporal and spatial constraints together with a spatial regularization weight simultaneously. Meanwhile, the proposed appearance model can be solved effectively based on the alternating direction method of multipliers algorithm. The spatial and temporal information concealed in the response maps is fully taken into consideration to boost overall tracking performance. Extensive experiments are conducted on a public UAV benchmark dataset with 123 challenging sequences. The experimental results and analysis demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms 12 state-of-the-art trackers in terms of both accuracy and robustness while efficiently operating in real time.",

      "abstract": "Accessing digital media has become quite a simple result of the fast rise of multimedia in the case of network technology. As a result, safeguarding intellectual property necessitates a greater focus on image watermarking. Distinct image watermarking systems have been introduced for this purpose; however, they have limitations with transparency and robustness. In the sphere of digital watermarking, multimedia copyright protection plays a critical part. The practice of extracting and embedding a watermark discreetly on a carrier image is called digital image watermarking. Digital watermarking is successful in securing digital data; it also has sparked a lot of study attention nowadays. Deep learning networks combined with wavelet-oriented approaches for image watermarking have gotten a lot of interest these days. Conventional watermarking techniques, on the other hand, cannot provide&nbsp;blindness, resilience, and automated extraction and embedding all at the same time. In this circumstance, this paper motivates to offer an improved approach for generating watermarked images with elevated invisibility using deep learning with a novel wavelet-based technique. Initially, after gathering the data, image griding is performed to partition the images into grids, thus making the image suitable for efficient feature extraction. Then, the two techniques named Deep feature extraction by Convolutional Neural Network and Neighboring-based features are extracted. Using these features, the Modified Deep Neural Network (MDNN) is used for choosing the regions for embedding the watermark. Here, the training algorithm of DNN is optimized by the Squirrel Search Algorithm (SSA) and Grey Wolf Optimization (GWO), known as Squirrel Search\u2013Grey Wolf Optimization (SS\u2013GWO). Once the regions are selected, watermark embedding is performed by the Adaptive Discrete Wavelet Transform (ADWT) with filter coefficient optimization by the same SS\u2013GWO based on a newly derived fitness function. Accordingly, the message extraction is achieved using the same ADWT with the embedding key. Throughout the results, the mean of SS\u2013GWO-MDNN\u2009+\u2009ADWT is 31.25%, 10.53%, 16.67%, and 23.53% improved than SSA-MDNN\u2009+\u2009ADWT, GWO-MDNN\u2009+\u2009ADWT, PSO-MDNN\u2009+\u2009ADWT, and JA-MDNN\u2009+\u2009ADWT regarding Gaussian filtering attack for dataset 3. The simulation findings, and a comparison of prior approaches, suggest that the developed&nbsp;mode has a considerable increase in image processing attack robustness, making it ideal for copyright protection applications.",

      "abstract": "Unmanned aerial vehicles can be deemed a threat for a wide range of disastrous scenarios in urban contexts, regarding critical infrastructures or in civil environments. Various countermeasures exist based on different technologies. One of the possibilities is a cloud of pellets that has a relatively short range. The objective of this approach is to maximize the covered area in order to increase the probability of hitting the target. A specific pellet-based C-UAS system has been identified for the purposes of this study. The present work assesses a single pellet and its critical range for collateral damage. The assessment was performed through the determination of a specific ballistic limit, in particular, the velocity at which 50 percent of the pellets fired perforate the test object. This limit is determined by following a NATO standard assessment of skin penetration of non-lethal projectiles on a gelatine skin surrogate. Previously published work has modeled the trajectory of the dedicated Counter-UAS projectile and has determined the ballistic limit for the intended target. With the addition of this study, the value of the collateral damage range can be determined in the trajectory model. Additionally, the obtained ballistic limits and inferred energy densities are contrasted to ballistic limits from comparable research campaigns by use of sectional densities.",

      "abstract": "With the rapid development of mobile devices, aggregation security and efficiency topics are more important than past in crowd sensing. When collecting large-scale vehicle-provided data, the data transmitted via autonomous networks are publicly accessible to all attackers, which increases the risk of vehicle exposure. So we need to ensure data aggregation security. In addition, low aggregation efficiency will lead to insufficient sensing data, making the data unable to provide data mining services. Aiming at the problem of aggregation security and efficiency in large-scale data collection, this article proposes a data collection mechanism (VDCM) for crowd sensing in vehicular ad hoc networks (VANETs). The mechanism includes two mechanism assumptions and selects appropriate methods to reduce consumption. It selects sub mechanism 1 when there exist very few vehicles or the coalition cannot be formed, otherwise selects sub mechanism 2. Single aggregation is used to collect data in sub mechanism 1. In sub mechanism 2, cooperative vehicles are selected by using coalition formation strategy and auction cooperation agreement, and multi aggregation is used to collect data. Two sub mechanisms use Paillier homomorphic encryption technology to ensure the security of data aggregation. In addition, mechanism supplements the data update and scoring steps to increase the amount of available data. The performance analysis shows that the mechanism proposed in this paper can safely aggregate data and reduce consumption. The simulation results indicate that the proposed mechanism reduces time consumption and increases the amount of available data compared with existing mechanisms. \u00c2\u00a9 2018 Tsinghua University Press.",

      "abstract": "The nonorthogonal multiple access (NOMA) technique for addressing fifth-generation (5G) new radio services is emerging as a promising technology. In contrast to the traditional orthogonal multiple access (OMA) techniques, NOMA can transmit a signal to various devices from the same resource block by exploiting the power domain and decoding the desired signal using the successive interference cancellation (SIC) technique. However, in large-scale 5G macro-cell scenarios, NOMA can need help to efficiently serve far-end devices due to long-distance transmission links, multipath fading, and non-line-of-sight (NLOS) problems. We explore flying small base stations (BSs), which can act as relays to mitigate link quality-related issues. Using the NOMA technique, multiple small-scale flying BSs can fly over the affected devices simultaneously and serve them without utilizing fewer resources compared to the conventional OMA method. We develop a novel intelligent unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV)-based navigation solution using federated deep reinforcement learning (DRL) whereby cost-efficient multiple UAV-BSs fly over certain areas autonomously and serve ground devices (GDs) using 5G NOMA systems without any interruption. We consider a greedy policy (GP) as a benchmark, where the UAV-BSs fly over high-priority devices to serve them. In addition, we consider the traveling salesman problem (TSP)-based navigation solution as a benchmark. We perform extensive simulation analysis for different system parameters, i.e., coverage time, coverage score (CS), and channel-to-noise ratio (CNR), and conclude that the proposed scheme outperforms other state-of-the-art methods. \u00c2\u00a9 2001-2012 IEEE.",

      "abstract": "The use of light detection and ranging technologies, i.e. terrestrial laser scanner (TLS), airborne laser scanner (ALS) and mobile laser scanner (MLS), together with the unmanned aerial vehicles digital photogrammetry (UAV-DP) and satellite data are proving to be fundamental tools to carry out reliable muographic measurement campaigns. The main purpose of this paper is to propose a workflow to correctly plan and exploit these types of data for muon radiography aims. To this end, a real case study is presented: searching for hidden tombs in the Etruscan necropolis of Palazzone (Umbria, Italy). A high-resolution digital elevation model (DEM) and three-dimensional models of the ground surface/sub-surface of the study area were created by merging data obtained using different survey methods to achieve the most accurate three-dimensional environment. Indeed, the simulated muon flux transmission used to infer relative transmission values, and the estimated density distribution, depends on the reliability of the three-dimensional reconstructed ground surface model. The aim of this study is to provide knowledge on the use of TLS and UAV-DP data and GPS-acquired points within the transmission-based muography process and how these data could improve or worsen the muon imaging results. Moreover, this study confirmed that muography applications require a multidisciplinary approach.",

      "abstract": "Internet of Vehicles (IoV) enabled Intelligent Transportation System (ITS) allows smart vehicles to communicate with other vehicles on road, humans (customers or pedestrians), infrastructure (parking areas, traffic lights etc), Internet, Cloud etc. The vehicles communicate with other entities over wireless open channels directly or indirectly through messages or beacons. Open channel allows various attacks, like replay, man-in-the-middle, impersonation, fabrication etc., during communication. Also, malicious vehicles can be deployed in the network to misuse or have an unauthorized access to the services. To mitigate these issues, we propose a new remote access control scheme that ensures the secure communication among the vehicles. The vehicles are dynamic in nature in an IoV paradigm, that is, they are not under fixed domains. Therefore, whenever a vehicle changes its location it has to register to the nearest trusted authority (TA) in offline or secured channel mode. To make it applicable, we propose remote registration of the vehicles via the TA. Access control mechanism occurs in two phases: 1) node authentication phase, where vehicles are remotely authenticated by TA and 2) key agreement phase, where after successful mutual authentication they compute a session key by using cryptographic techniques and pre-loaded information. The computed secret session keys are used for ensuring secure communications in future between two vehicles in a cluster as well. Informal security analysis along with formal security verification using the broadly-used Automated Validation of Internet Security Protocols and Applications (AVISPA) show that our access control scheme is secured against various potential attacks. We also show the competency of our scheme by comparing it with other existing schemes in terms of computation and communication costs. \u00c2\u00a9 2022",

      "abstract": "Bionic aircrafts have become a hot topic in the research on unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs). By mimicking the flight mechanics and wing morphology of living organisms, bionic aircraft not only improve aerodynamic performance, stealth, and convenience but also enable single aircraft to complete multiple specific tasks. To further improve the practical performance of bionic aircraft, a fixed-flapping hybrid morphing wing aerial vehicle (F-FWAV) is designed, and the aerodynamic and flight mechanics are studied. First, kinematic simulations are conducted on the designed F-FWAV, and the kinematic characteristics of the flapping wing are analyzed. Then, flight tests are conducted on the aircraft model, and time-domain and frequency-domain analyses were performed on the data of the pitch angle and roll angle during level flight, high angle of attack (AOA) maneuvering and landing, indicating that the pitch and roll angles of the F-FWAV are coupled. CFD numerical simulations are used to obtain the cruise points of the F-FWAV under different AOAs, frequencies, and freestream velocities. The results of the mutual interference between the fixed wing and flapping wing sections show that the flapping wing section provides more than 50 % of the lift of the entire flight process, and the downward flapping movement of the flapping wing section increases the edge vortex of the fixed wing section, thereby increasing the lift of the fixed wing section. \u00c2\u00a9 2023",

      "abstract": "Natural resources are under tremendous amounts of threat as a result of the expanding human population, which over time intensifies changes in Land use and Land cover (LULC). Understanding how various machine learning classifiers function is crucial as the demand for an accurate estimate of LULC from satellite images. The purpose of this research was to classify the LULC in the entire Karnataka state, using three distinct methods on the Google Earth Engine (GEE) namely RF (Random Forest), SVM (Support Vector Machine) and CART (Classification Regression Trees), are examples of machine learning techniques. The LULC is classified by the training sets using supervised classification. The NDVI (Normalized difference vegetation index) was assessed and used to increase classification accuracy. The LULC classification for the years 2015 to 2021 utilizes multi-temporal images like Sentinel-2, Landsat-8, and MODIS data with spatial resolution of 10&nbsp;m, 30&nbsp;m, and 250&nbsp;m. Agricultural land, Built-up land, Forest land, Fallow land, wasteland, water body and others, are major LULC classes, it lies on a level I classification. According to the findings, the change % of agricultural land is high from 2015 (64.03%) to 2021 (67.81%), this roughly increased about 3.78% during the study year. While water bodies increased by 5.25 to 6.3%. Based on the results, the largest LULC group is agricultural land (122,789.4&nbsp;km2 or 64.03%), followed by forest land (37,678.56&nbsp;km2 or 19.65%). Increased built-up land in the studied area indicates extraordinarily rapid urban growth in major cities of the state. This research offers a reliable approach for comprehensive, automated, and LULC classification in Karnataka State.",

      "abstract": "The recognition and detection of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV) usually face the difficulty of insufficient samples. Given a limited number of real UAV images, it is a challenging task to generate virtual UAV images to enrich both the diversity and quantity of training samples. Aiming at this problem, we propose a novel attribute-matched generative adversarial network (AMGAN) that can migrate a UAV object from a single background to a complex background. AMGAN consists of three parts: the basic network, the pairing network, and the background constraint. Image attributes are first disentangled and then reorganized by the basic network, which is prone to attribute collapse. Then the pairing network introduces attribute-level discriminators to make the same-type attributes match each other correctly. Furthermore, the background constraint is added to guide model convergence and eliminate the attribute residue problem. Qualitative experimental results show that AMGAN can generate a large number of high-fidelity virtual UAV images in various backgrounds. Quantitative experimental results on small-scale datasets demonstrate that when these generated images are used for data augmentation, both the diversity and quantity of samples can be greatly increased, boosting the UAV recognition performance.",

All methods are explained from the development of two large-scale on-site assembly manipulators and end-effectors for picking up, transporting, placing and connecting components to automated data extraction of the BIM model, path planning, trajectory generation, feedback control, and practical tests with robotic total station measurements. The on-site assembly process is semi-automated, which demonstrates its feasibility. A comparison to a simulated benchmark that exploits all speed limits shows the automation potential.

      "abstract": "Path planning of an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) or its variant supported with weapon systems, also called unmanned combat aerial vehicle (UCAV), is one of the most crucial steps for the autonomous flight and requires compelling decisions being made by considering the existence of the enemy defence, obstacles, and battery or fuel capacity of the vehicle optimally before starting the flight. Immune plasma algorithm (IP algorithm or IPA), inspired by the convalescent plasma treatment which is a medical method being popularized again with the rise of new coronavirus or COVID-19, has been introduced recently as a new optimization technique and the promising performance of the mentioned algorithm validated through a set of numerical and engineering problems. In this study, the IP algorithm was specialized as a three-dimensional UCAV path planner for the first time. Its performance was investigated particularly by using three different battlefield environments and assigning various constants to the population size. Moreover, the effect of two IPA-specific control parameters that are responsible for determining the number of donors and number of receivers on the qualities of the calculated paths were analyzed in detail. The results obtained by the IPA were compared with the results of other three-dimensional path planners guiding optimization algorithms such as simulated annealing (SA), gray wolf optimizer (GWO) and symbiotic organism search (SOS). Experimental studies showed that the main idea lying behind the usage of qualified solutions as donors and transferring information directly from them to the receivers representing the poor solutions of the problem gives a positive contribution to the exploitation-dominant operations of IPA and fully complies with the challenging requirements of the path planning problem. Especially in the battlefields for which an optimal or near optimal path contains complex maneuvers, the advantages from the subtly balanced operational steps of the IPA become more apparent by setting the number of donors and receivers appropriately and IPA is found to be more stable and successful compared to the other tested algorithms.",

The CAV is a complex interconnected system consisting of sensors, Artificial Intelligence (AI) processors and external units to assure the automated driving without human interaction. Such complexity increases the attack surfaces and makes the CAV highly vulnerable to cyber assaults. It also entangles security audits and certifications procedures. Our work lays out a novel approach towards CAV's certification focused on cybersecurity and data privacy aspects. Stipulated by the analysis on existing standards\u00e2\u0080\u0099 limitations, we propose a Standards Coverage Map (SCM) outlining the CAV's entire ecosystem and linking organisational and technical aspects to the latest standards and regulations from the cyber perspective. \u00c2\u00a9 2023 The Author(s)",

      "abstract": "Carbapenem-Resistant Enterobacterales (CRE) has been categorized as pathogens of critical priority by World Health organization (WHO) as they pose significant threat to global public health. Carbapenemase production considered as the principal resistance mechanism against carbapenems and with the recent surge and expansion of carbapenemases and its variants among clinically significant bacteria in India, the present study reports expansion blaOXA\u221278 and blaOXA\u221258 of in CRE of clinical origin. Bacterial isolates were collected from a tertiary referral hospital and identified through VITEK\u00ae 2 Compact automated System (Biomerieux, France). Rapidec\u00ae Carba NP (Biomerieux, France) was used to investigate carbapenemase production followed by antibiotic susceptibility testing through Kirby-Bauer Disc Diffusion method and agar dilution method. Class D carbapenemase genes were targeted through PCR assay followed by investigation of horizontal transmission of blaOXA\u221258 and blaOXA\u221278. Whole genome sequencing was carried out using Illumina platform to investigate the genetic context of blaOXA\u221258 and blaOXA\u221278 genes and further characterization of the CRE isolates. The carbapenem-resistant Escherichia coli (BJD_EC456) and Serratia marcescens (BJD_SM81) received during the study from the tertiary referral hospital were isolated from sputum and blood samples respectively. PCR assay followed by whole genome sequencing revealed that the isolates co-harbor blaOXA\u221258 and blaOXA\u221278, a variant of blaOXA\u221251. Horizontal transfer of blaOXA\u221258 and blaOXA\u221278 genes were unsuccessful as these genes were located on the chromosome of the study isolates. Transposon Tn6080 was linked to blaOXA\u221278 in the upstream region while the insertion sequences ISAba26 and ISCfr1 were identified in the upstream and downstream region of blaOXA\u221258 gene respectively. In addition, both the isolates were co-harboring multiple antibiotic resistance genes conferring clinical resistance towards beta-lactams, aminoglycosides, fluroquinolones, sulphonamides, tetracyclines. BJD_EC180 belonged to ST2437 while BJD_SM81 was of an unknown sequence type. The nucleotide sequences of blaOXA\u221278 (OQ533021) and blaOXA\u221258 (OQ533022) have been deposited in GenBank. The study provides a local epidemiological information regarding carbapenem resistance aided by transposon and insertion sequences associated blaOXA\u221278 and blaOXA\u221258 genes associated and warrants continuous monitoring to prevent their further dissemination into carbapenem non-susceptible strains thereby contributing to carbapenem resistance burden which is currently a global concern.",

      "abstract": "Swarms of Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) are a key technology to support communication in many harsh environments where fixed infrastructures (e.g., 5G) are disrupted or not available. However, the fast mobility and highly dynamic network topology pose unique challenges and require the development of novel multi-hop routing protocols. Previous work in this direction extends geographical protocols or adapts approaches designed for Mobile Ad-hoc NETworks (MANETs), rarely taking full advantage of UAV capabilities. In this paper, we introduce a novel data offloading approach, namely Stop & Offload, that exploits the device controllable mobility to facilitate network routing. The swarm of UAVs performs data offloading synchronously and recurrently. At fixed intervals of time, the swarm interrupts the sensing mission (Stop) and moves, as little as possible, to build a connected formation to the base station and offload the data (Offload). We provide both centralized solutions \u00e2\u0080\u0094 assuming a long-range control channel \u00e2\u0080\u0094 and a distributed solution \u00e2\u0080\u0094 working in the absence of a control channel. By means of extensive simulations we show that our proposals outperform state-of-the-art solutions, decreasing the time taken to build a connected formation of about 45% and increasing the time spent on sensing of 10%. Additionally, we compared our protocol with various routing strategies and observe remarkable improvements, including a 50% reduction in average packet delay. \u00c2\u00a9 2023 The Author(s)",

      "abstract": "The rate of convergence is a vital factor in determining the outcome of the mission execution of unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) swarms. However, the difficulty of developing a rapid convergence strategy increases dramatically with the growth of swarm scale. In the present work, a novel fractional-order flocking algorithm (FOFA) is proposed for large-scale UAV swarms. First, based on the interaction rules of repulsion, attraction and alignment among swarm individuals, fractional calculus is introduced to replace traditional integer-order velocity updating, which enables UAVs to utilize historical information during flight. Subsequently, the convergence of the algorithm is theoretically analyzed. Some sufficient convergence conditions for the FOFA are presented by exploiting graph theory. Finally, the simulation results validate that our proposed FOFA performs much better than traditional flocking algorithms in terms of convergence rate. Meanwhile, the relationships between the fractional order of the FOFA and the convergence time of the UAV swarm are discussed. We find that under certain conditions, the fractional order is strongly correlated with the convergence rate of the UAV swarm; that is, a small fractional order (more consideration of historical information) leads to better performance. Moreover, the fractional order can be used as an important parameter to control the convergence rate of a large-scale UAV swarm.",

The UAV features a durable F450 frame quadcopter with four 1000KV brushless motors and a KK2.1 Flight Control Board for stability and manoeuvrability with a runtime of 90 min. It incorporates a Raspberry Pi camera for real-time video streaming, enabling efficient identification of individuals in need of assistance. The GSM module allows contactless communication, ensuring streamlined and safe interaction. A motor controls the lid of the customizable first aid kit box, facilitating efficient aid delivery. The Neo-6 M GPS module provides accurate localization of the drone and individuals in distress with a horizontal position accuracy of 2.5 m. The UAV collects temperature and humidity data using the DHT 11 sensor having +/- 2 degreesC and +- 5% accuracy respectively. This sensor employs advanced deep learning models, including artificial neural networks (ANN) and generative adversarial networks (GANs), for real-time forest fire prediction with an accuracy of 90.7 % The integration of GANs enhances accuracy through synthetic data generation. Moreover, all these components are interfaced using a Raspberry Pi4 and a GUI, providing a smooth user control experience and end-to-end information for quick and effective emergency response. \u00c2\u00a9 2023 The Author(s)",

      "abstract": "Applications such as autonomous vehicles and medical screening use deep learning models to localize and identify hundreds of objects in a single frame. In the past, it has been shown how an attacker can fool these models by placing an adversarial patch within a scene. However, these patches must be placed in the target location and do not explicitly alter the semantics elsewhere in the image. In this paper, we introduce a new type of adversarial patch which alters a model\u2019s perception of an image\u2019s semantics. These patches can be placed anywhere within an image to change the classification or semantics of locations far from the patch. We call this new class of adversarial examples \u2018remote adversarial patches\u2019 (RAP). We implement our own RAP called IPatch and perform an in-depth analysis on without pixel clipping on image segmentation RAP attacks using five state-of-the-art architectures with eight different encoders on the CamVid street view dataset. Moreover, we demonstrate that the attack can be extended to object recognition models with preliminary results on the popular YOLOv3 model. We found that the patch can change the classification of a remote target region with a success rate of up to 93% on average.",

      "abstract": "Earthquakes are sudden and unpredictable disasters that pose significant threats to human lives, property, and societal stability. Utilizing remote sensing techniques enables the rapid acquisition of disaster information from affected areas, aiding in the localization, identification, and serving as a reference for emergency response to damaged buildings. This study proposed a UAV image-based approach for seismic damage assessment in mountainous regions, combining recursive feature elimination (RFE) and object-oriented coupling with the random forest classifier. The ESP2 tool is employed to determine optimal segmentation scales, reducing the manual labor of segmenting images at various scales and improving the efficiency of selecting the best segmentation scale. Taking the June 18, 2019 post-earthquake UAV imagery of Shuanghe Town, Changning County, Sichuan Province as the study area, an object-oriented multi-level classification system is established using the ESP2 algorithm. Subsequently, features selected through recursive feature elimination (RFE) are utilized in conjunction with an optimized random forest classifier for building seismic damage identification. Results show that optimal segmentation scales for vegetation, rivers, and buildings are 196, 156, and 130, respectively, with RFE elimination process reducing the initial 57 features to 24. Following RFE optimization, the overall accuracy of building seismic damage identification reaches 95.3%, with a Kappa coefficient of 0.807. This approach, utilizing a reduced number of features for enhanced accuracy, effectively contributes to seismic damage identification for buildings.",

      "abstract": "Obstacle avoidance path planning is considered an essential requirement for unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) to reach its designated mission area and perform its tasks. This study established a motion model and obstacle threat model for UAVs, and defined the cost coefficients for evading and crossing threat areas. To solve the problem of obstacle avoidance path planning with full coverage of threats, the cost coefficients were incorporated into the objective optimization function and solved by a combination of Sequential Quadratic Programming and Nonlinear Programming Solver. The problem of path planning under threat full coverage with no solution was resolved by improving the B\u00e9zier curve algorithm. By introducing the dynamic threat velocity obstacle model and calculating the relative and absolute collision cones, a path planning algorithm under multiple dynamic threats was proposed to solve the difficulties of dynamic obstacle prediction and avoidance. Simulation results revealed that the proposed Through-out method was more effective in handling full threat coverage and dynamic threats than traditional path planning methods namely, Detour or Cross Gaps. Our study offers valuable insights into autonomous path planning for UAVs that operate under complex threat conditions. This work is anticipated to contribute to the future development of more advanced and intelligent UAV systems.",

      "abstract": "Laws granting the right to obtain active assistance in dying initially concern people suffering from incurable illnesses that cause unbearable suffering and are life-threatening in the short to medium term. But these laws are always followed by proposals and debates aimed at extending the indications for euthanasia or assisted suicide to incurable conditions, even if they are not life-threatening, as soon as they cause unbearable suffering. And so it is that some countries accept psychiatric illnesses that are declared incurable as indications for access to active assistance in dying. In Belgium and the Netherlands, for example, the press has reported on cases of people suffering from depression or post-traumatic stress disorder who have been euthanized at the end of an authorization process that involves two psychiatric opinions declaring their condition incurable, without any collegial reflection on the diagnosis or the therapeutic programs implemented. Depression and post-traumatic stress disorder, however, account for less than half of all indications for euthanasia for psychiatric illness in Belgium. That leaves us with patients labelled psychotic and with ill-defined personality and behaviour disorders. Psychiatric indications for euthanasia raise their own specific ethical issues. How can we fail to underline the uncertainty and complexity of the diagnosis, which cannot, as a rule, be supported by imaging or biology? How can we understand that indications for euthanasia are accepted for patients with several psychiatric diagnoses? From one end of the procedure to the other, the problem is to obtain the opinions of two psychiatrists declaring that the disorders are incurable, that the suffering is intolerable and that the patient's capacity for discernment is intact. The decision thus stems from a libertarian paternalism convinced of the humanist dimension of active aid in dying, and which results in an incentive (nudge) whose aim, set by the law, is only to know whether the suffering is incurable, without calling into question the diagnosis and therapeutic programs. How can we say that a mental illness is incurable? How can we distinguish between a depressed person's disgust with life and so-called existential suffering? How can we reconcile preventing suicide in cases of depression and social isolation, while at the same time encouraging assisted suicide or euthanasia for the same people? What are the criteria for verifying that the capacity for discernment has been preserved? Is there not a danger, in the name of autonomic relentlessness, of declaring that a person is autonomous when in fact he or she is subject to the heteronomy of depression, delirium or obsessive disorders? The world of psychiatry cannot avoid such questions. The American Psychiatric Association, for example, has adopted the position on medical euthanasia holding that \u00e2\u0080\u009ca psychiatrist should not prescribe or administer any intervention to a non-terminally ill person for the purpose of causing death\u00e2\u0080\u009d. Other psychiatric associations have hesitant positions. The debate must be opened. It must involve all those who treat, care for and support people of all ages whose mental health is suffering. It must also concern every citizen. \u00c2\u00a9 2023 Elsevier Masson SAS",

      "abstract": "Medication errors can have severe consequences and threaten patient safety. The patient safety-related benefits of automated dispensing cabinets (ADCs) have been reported by several previous studies, including a reduction in medication errors in intensive care units (ICUs) and emergency departments. However, the benefits of ADCs need to be assessed, given the different healthcare practice models. This study aimed to compare the rates of medication errors, including prescription, dispensing, and administrative, before and after using ADCs in intensive care units. The prescription, dispensing, and administrative error data before and after the adoption of ADCs were retrospectively collected from the medication error report system. The severity of medication errors was classified according to the National Coordinating Council for Medication Error Reporting and Prevention guidelines. The study outcome was the rate of medication errors. After the adoption of ADCs in the intensive care units, the rates of prescription and dispensing errors reduced from 3.03 to 1.75 per 100,000 prescriptions and 3.87 to 0 per 100,000 dispensations, respectively. The administrative error rate decreased from 0.046 to 0.026%. The ADCs decreased National Coordinating Council for Medication Error Reporting and Prevention category B and D errors by 75% and category C errors by 43%. To improve medication safety, multidisciplinary collaboration and strategies, such as the use of automated dispensing cabinets, education, and training programs from a systems perspective, are warranted.",

      "abstract": "One of the network performance challenges of Vehicular Ad Hoc Networks (VANET) is the Black Hole attack. This destructive attack severely damages the network performance if succeeded. By replying to a route request with the minimum routing cost and the maximum sequence number (SN) value, the malicious vehicle can fool the source vehicle that it has the \u201cfreshest\u201d and best cost-effective route to the destination vehicle. As a result, all data packets intended to a legitimate destination are caught and destroyed by the malicious vehicle. This may also cause a serious risk for autonomous vehicle control system or traffic warning applications. Previous published malicious detection algorithms suffer high error rates when the malicious node uses a \u201cclose-to-legitimate\u201d SN value to attack or actively change the information in the route reply packet. This paper proposes a Black Hole Attack Detection Algorithm (BADA) based on a machine learning approach. In VANETs, it is a challenge to differentiate the behavior of malicious vehicles as they try to avoid detection by imitating that of the normal vehicles. The BADA classification algorithm outperforms existing solutions because it relies on the history of each vehicle\u2019s route request and response behavior, and it deploys the k-Nearest Neighbors machine learning algorithm to identify malicious vehicles. The paper also proposes a Black hole Attack Detection Routing Protocol which utilizes the proposed BADA solution to realize a more secured and improved AODV-based protocol. Using the NS2 simulation system, the paper evaluates the performance of the proposed protocol and compares it with related solutions on the traffic network model in Ho Chi Minh city, Vietnam under black hole attacks using minimum SN values. Simulation results have shown that the proposed algorithm can correctly detect the malicious node higher than 99.0%, outperforming previously published algorithms.",

      "abstract": "Introduction: Cycling is popular for its ecological, economic, and health benefits. However, especially in rural areas, cyclists may need to share the road with motorized traffic, which is often perceived as a threat. Overtaking a cyclist is a particularly critical maneuver for drivers as they need to control their lateral clearance and speed when passing the cyclist, possibly in the presence of oncoming vehicles or view-obstructing curves. An overtaking vehicle can destabilize the cyclist when passing with low clearance and high speed. At the same time, the cyclist may get scared and eventually stop cycling. In this work, we investigated how visibility regarding available sight distance\u00e2\u0080\u0094an important factor for infrastructure design and regulation\u00e2\u0080\u0094affects drivers\u00e2\u0080\u0099 behavior when overtaking cyclists. Method: Using four roadside-based traffic sensors, we collected naturalistic data that contained kinematics of drivers overtaking cyclists on a rural road in Sweden. We modeled lateral clearance and speed at the passing moment in response to variables such as sight distance and oncoming traffic with a Bayesian multivariate approach. Results: Fitted on 81 maneuvers, the model revealed that drivers reduced lateral clearance under reduced sight distance. Speed was similarly reduced, however, not as clearly. When an oncoming vehicle was present, it had a similar\u00e2\u0080\u0094yet stronger\u00e2\u0080\u0094effect than sight distance. While we found an overall correlation between clearance and speed, some maneuvers were recorded at critically low clearance. Conclusions: Cyclists\u00e2\u0080\u0099 safety is endangered when passed by drivers under reduced visibility or close to oncoming traffic. Practical Applications: Decision-making for infrastructure and policymaking should aim at prohibiting overtaking in areas with reduced visibility or close oncoming traffic. The model developed in this study may serve as a reference to vehicle active-safety systems and automated driving.

      "abstract": "Digital twins have been developed in the oil and gas industry to support a more precise risk assessment that enables performance improvement of offshore structures throughout their life span. Usually, a floating, production, storage and offloading (FPSO) unit is required to exploit oil fields in deep and ultra-deepwater with the postponement of the decommissioning stage, leading to increasing maintenance costs due to aging effects. This paper proposes an adaptive methodology for the development of a digital twin that performs automated numerical analysis via finite element model updating (FEMU) based on coupled systems of a high-fidelity FPSO hull model. The methodology employs a three-cargo tank length finite element (FE) model to receive data and automatically solve multiple numerical analyses. If during results checking any alert level is reached by any structural component, a more complex structural reliability method is applied to provide failure probability considering material strength statistical distribution. The application herein investigates the effects of corrosion, but other phenomena can be considered within the developed framework. A corrosion prediction model is used to create different hypotheses of degradation for bottom plates, while data provided from coupled systems are considered to investigate the effect of deterioration. The results demonstrate a consistent probability of failure when compared to the evolution of the predicted corrosion during service life.",

      "abstract": "The current mixed method study aimed to examine (1) the types of body-related discrepancies that college-aged women face, (2) the association between women\u2019s motivation for eating regulation and intent to engage in healthy and disordered eating following such experiences, and (3) the mediating role of affect and compensation strategies in these relationships. Thematic analysis of narratives from a body-related self-discrepancy recall task revealed that Canadian college-aged women (N\u2009=\u2009398) experience discrepancies related to the appearance and care of their bodies. These experiences were more likely to occur in a non-social-evaluative setting. A path analysis revealed that autonomous eating regulation was associated with healthy eating intentions, whereas controlled eating regulation was associated with disordered eating intentions following a recalled body-related discrepancy. These distinct pathways were partly explained by levels of self-compassion and selection of distinct behavioral and cognitive compensation strategies. Findings suggest that those with autonomous eating regulation possess a resource, self-compassion, which aids self-regulation following body-related threats.",

      "abstract": "In a world where Artificial Intelligence (AI) is pervasive, humans may feel threatened or at risk by giving up control to machines. In this context, ethicality becomes a major concern to prevent AI systems from being biased, making mistakes, or going rogue. Requirements Engineering (RE) is the research area that can exert a great impact in the development of ethical systems by design. However, proposing concepts, tools and techniques that support the incorporation of ethicality into the software development processes as explicit requirements remains a great challenge in the RE field. In this paper, we rely on Ontology-based Requirements Engineering (ObRE) as a method to elicit and analyze ethicality requirements (\u2018Ethicality requirements\u2019 is adopted as a name for the class of requirements studied in this paper by analogy to other quality requirements studied in software engineering, such as usability, reliability, and portability, etc. The use of this term (as opposed to \u2018ethical requirements\u2019) highlights that they represent requirements for ethical systems, analogous to how \u2018trustworthiness requirements\u2019 represent requirements for trustworthy systems. To put simply: the predicates \u2018ethical\u2019 or \u2018trustworthy\u2019 are not meant to be predicated over the requirements themselves). ObRE applies ontological analysis to ontologically unpack terms and notions that are referred to in requirements elicitation. Moreover, this method instantiates the adopted ontology and uses it to guide the requirements analysis activity. In a previous paper, we presented a solution concerning two ethical principles, namely Beneficence and Non-maleficence. The present paper extends the previous work by targeting two other important ethicality principles, those of Explicability and Autonomy. For each of these new principles, we do ontological unpacking of the relevant concepts, and we present requirements elicitation and analysis guidelines, as well as examples in the context of a driverless car case. Furthermore, we validate our approach by analysing the requirements elicitation made for the driverless car case in contrast with a similar case, and by assessing our method\u2019s coverage w.r.t European Union guidelines for Trustworthy AI.",

      "abstract": "The real-time path planning of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) in dynamic environments with moving threats is a difficult problem. To solve this problem, this paper proposes a time-based rapidly exploring random tree (time-based RRT*) algorithm, called the hierarchical rapidly exploring random tree algorithm based on potential function lazy planning and low-cost optimization (HPO-RRT*). The HPO-RRT* algorithm can guarantee path homotopy optimality and high planning efficiency. This algorithm uses a hierarchical architecture comprising a UAV perception system, path planner, and path optimizer. After the UAV perception system predicts moving threats and updates world information, the path planner obtains the heuristic path. First, the path planner uses the bias sampling method based on the artificial potential field function proposed in this paper to guide sampling to improve the efficiency and quality of sampling. Then, the tree is efficiently extended by the improved time-based lazy collision checking RRT* algorithm to obtain the heuristic path. Finally, a low-cost path optimizer quickly optimizes the heuristic path directly to optimize the path while avoiding additional calculations. Simulation results show that the proposed algorithm outperforms the three existing advanced algorithms in terms of addressing the real-time path-planning problem of UAVs in a dynamic environment.",

      "abstract": "The estimation of the airspeed and angle of attack (AOA) is crucial for achieving precise flight control in small unmanned aerial vehicles. A flexible skin with distributed flow sensors has been proven to be an effective approach to estimate flight parameters, particularly, pressure-airflow data fusion strategies can improve estimation accuracy. For the first time, we propose an ultrathin ( 70 \\mu \\text{m} ) all-polyimide flexible skin integrated with capacitive pressure sensors and piezoresistive airflow sensors. The ultrathin structure of the flexible skin endows it with flexibility and adaptability to curved airfoils and avoids disturbing the flow field near the surface. Meanwhile, the rational arrangement of the sensors on the leading edge of the airfoil makes them insensitive to the angle of sideslip (AOS). The pressure and airflow sensors achieve a resolution of 4.5 Pa and 2.4 m/s, respectively. Using a simple multilayer perceptron (MLP) neural network, we estimate the average solving errors of airspeed and AOA to be 0.79 m/s and 0.67\u00c2\u00b0, respectively. Compared with traditional methods, the proposed flexible skin considerably reduces the workload by decoupling the airspeed, AOA, and AOS, providing a facile method for efficient and accurate flight parameter estimation. \u00c2\u00a9 2001-2012 IEEE.",

      "abstract": "Urinary tract infections (UTIs) in children are very common. They are often associated with a high risk of sepsis and death. In recent years, antibiotic-resistant uropathogens ESKAPE (Enterococcus faecium,\u00a0Staphylococcus aureus,\u00a0Klebsiella pneumoniae,\u00a0Acinetobacter baumannii,\u00a0Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and\u00a0Enterobacteriaceae) are increasingly encountered in UTIs. These bacteria, usually multidrug-resistance (MDR), extensive drug-resistance (XDR), pandrug-resistance (PDR), Extended-spectrum cephalosporin-resistance (ESC), Usual Drug Resistance (UDR), Difficult-to-Treat Resistance (DTR) and Carbapenem-resistance Enterobacteriales (CRE), represent a global threat for the management of paediatric UTIs. The aim of this study was to determine the epidemiology of community origin and antibiotic sensitivity of major ESKAPE uropathogens in paediatric UTIs in South-East Gabon. The study involved 508 children aged 0\u201317\u00a0years. Identification of bacterial isolates was carried out using Vitek-2 compact automated system and the antibiogram with the disk diffusion and microdilution methods according to the European Committee on Antimicrobial Susceptibility Testing recommendations. Logistic regression analysis was used to assess the impact of patients' socio-clinical characteristics on uropathogens phenotype in both univariate and multivariate analysis. The prevalence of UTIs was 59%. E. coli (35%) and K. pneumoniae (34%) were the main ESKAPE involved in UTIs followed by Enterococcus spp. (8%) and S. aureus (6%). Among major ESKAPE, DTR-E. coli (p\u2009=\u20090.01), CRE-E. coli (p\u2009=\u20090.02) and XDR-E. coli (p\u2009=\u20090.03), Trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole-resistant bacteria (p\u2009=\u20090.03) were associated with abdomino-pelvic pain. While MDR-E. coli (p\u2009<\u20090.001), UDR-E. coli (p\u2009=\u20090.02), ESC-E. coli (p\u2009<\u20090.001), MDR- Enterococcus (p\u2009=\u20090.04), UDR- Enterococcus (p\u2009=\u20090.02), bacteria resistant to Ampicillin (p\u2009<\u20090.01), Cefotaxime (p\u2009=\u20090.04), Ciprofloxacin (p\u2009<\u20090.001), Benzylpenicillin (p\u2009=\u20090.03) and Amikacin (p\u2009=\u20090.04) were more frequent among male children. MDR-Enterococcus (p\u2009<\u20090.01), bacteria resistant to Amoxicillin-clavulanic acid (p\u2009=\u20090.03), Cefalotin (p\u2009=\u20090.01), Ampicillin (p\u2009=\u20090.02) and Gentamicin (p\u2009=\u20090.03) were associated with treatment failure. In addition, Trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole-resistant bacteria (p\u2009=\u20090.03) was associated with recurrent UTIs while those resistant to Ciprofloxacin was associated with pollakiuria (p\u2009=\u20090.01) and urinary burning (p\u2009=\u20090.04). Furthermore, UDR-K. pneumoniae (p\u2009=\u20090.02) was more frequent in neonates and infants. This study determined the epidemiology of ESKAPE uropathogens in paediatric UTIs. It found a high prevalence of paediatric UTIs associated with children\u2019s socio-clinical characteristics and diverse bacterial antibiotic resistance phenotypes.",

      "abstract": "For autonomous driving, one of the major challenges is to predict pedestrian crossing intention in ego-view. Pedestrian intention depends not only on their intrinsic goals but also on the stimulation of surrounding traffic elements. Considering the influence of other traffic elements on pedestrian intention, recent work introduced more traffic element information into the model to successfully improve performance. However, it is still difficult to effectively capture and fully exploit the potential dynamic spatio-temporal interactions among the target pedestrian and its surrounding traffic elements for accurate reasoning. In this work, inspired by neuroscience that human drivers tend to make continuous sensory-motor driving decisions by progressive visual stimulation, we propose a model termed Progressive Interaction Transformer (PIT) for pedestrian crossing intention prediction. Local pedestrian, global environment, and ego-vehicle motion are considered simultaneously in the proposed PIT. In particular, the temporal fusion block and self-attention mechanism are introduced to jointly and progressively model the dynamic spatio-temporal interactions among the three parties, allowing it to capture richer information and make prediction in a similar way to human drivers. Experimental results demonstrate that PIT achieves higher performance compared with other state-of-the-arts and preserves real-time inference. \u00c2\u00a9 2000-2011 IEEE.",

      "abstract": "5th Generation(5G) -enabled Internet of Things (IoT) connects billions of devices for high-speed data transfer. The data collected fuel many automation applications such as smart cities, industrial automation 5.0, autonomous vehicles and healthcare sectors. However, the critical challenges concerning such an environment are Open Web Security and Mutual Authentication. The recent security protocols of IoT are based on hard mathematical cryptographic structures. Nevertheless, dependency on the security of classical cryptographic primitives is at risk of being broken by Quantum Computing. Recent Quantum attacks on IoT security have motivated us to survey Quantum-resistant solutions comprehensively. Therefore in this paper, we analysed how the technology shifts from classical cryptographic techniques towards quantum-enabled solutions to achieve end-to-end security. The main objective of this survey is to provide a systematic roadmap in the area of Quantum secured 5G-enabled IoT communication by covering current research on 5G-enabled IoT with its key enabling technologies, threats imposed on 5G-enabled IoT applications, state-of-the-art quantum-based solutions and initiatives. A detailed overview of the quantum computing preliminaries, Post Quantum Cryptography (PQC) schemes, Quantum Cryptography (QC), and Quantum Key Distribution (QKD) with their significant advantage in securing IoT-enabled communication over classical scenarios are also presented. Particularly, we emphasize Post-Quantum resistant techniques that must be used soon to secure 5G-enabled IoT communications. The comparative analysis of quantum-resistant schemes with classical cryptographic schemes in terms of key size, data size, time complexity and impact of quantum computers on these schemes are discussed. This paper identifies the technical challenges in Quantum-based schemes and provides future research directions to enable Post-Quantum resistant cryptography for secure communication in 5G-enabled IoT. \u00c2\u00a9 2023 Elsevier B.V.",

However, the internal or external factors that compromise cell competition and provoke carcinogenesis remain elusive. In this study, we examine the effect of sequential accumulation of gene mutations, mimicking multi-sequential carcinogenesis on RasV12-induced cell competition in intestinal epithelial tissues. Consequently, we find that the directionality of RasV12-cell extrusion in Wnt-activated epithelia is reversed, and transformed cells are delaminated into the basal lamina via non-cell autonomous MMP21 upregulation. Subsequently, diffusively infiltrating, transformed cells develop into highly invasive carcinomas. The elevated production of MMP21 is elicited partly through NF-\u03baB signaling, blockage of which restores apical elimination of RasV12 cells. We further demonstrate that the NF-\u03baB-MMP21 axis is significantly bolstered in early colorectal carcinoma in humans. Collectively, this study shows that cells with high mutational burdens exploit cell competition for their benefit by behaving as unfit cells, endowing them with an invasion advantage. The relevance of cell competition in intestinal epithelial carcinogenesis remains to be explored. Here, the authors find aberrant Wnt activation in RasV12-transformed cells reverses the directionality of cell extrusion mediated by cell competition in intestinal epithelium, causing infiltration into basal lamina rather than apical elimination of transformed cells and consequent development of invasive carcinomas.",

      "abstract": "Federated learning systems encounter various security risks, including backdoor, inference and adversarial attacks. Backdoor attacks within this context generally require careful trigger sample design involving candidate selection and automated optimization. Previous methods randomly selected trigger candidates from training dataset, disrupting sample distribution and blurring boundaries among them, which adversely affected the main task accuracy. Moreover, these methods employed non-optimized handcrafted triggers, resulting in a weakened backdoor mapping relationship and lower attack success rates. In this work, we propose a flexible backdoor attack approach, Trigger Sample Selection and Optimization (TSSO), motivated by neural network classification patterns. TSSO employs autoencoders and locality-sensitive hashing to select trigger candidates at class boundaries for precise injection. Furthermore, it iteratively refines trigger representations via the global model and historical outcomes, establishing a robust mapping relationship. TSSO is evaluated on four classical datasets with non-IID settings, outperforming state-of-the-art methods by achieving higher attack success rate in fewer rounds, prolonging the backdoor effect. In scalability tests, even with the defense deployed, TSSO achieved the attack success rate of over 80% with only 4% malicious clients (a poisoning rate of 1/640). \u00c2\u00a9 2023 Elsevier Inc.",

      "abstract": "Flapping flight of animals has captured the interest of researchers due to their impressive flight capabilities across diverse environments including mountains, oceans, forests, and urban areas. Despite the significant progress made in understanding flapping flight, high-altitude flight as showcased by many migrating animals remains underexplored. At high-altitudes, air density is low, and it is challenging to produce lift. Here we demonstrate a first lift-off of a flapping wing robot in a low-density environment through wing size and motion scaling. Force measurements showed that the lift remained high at 0.14 N despite a 66% reduction of air density from the sea-level condition. The flapping amplitude increased from 148 to 233 degrees, while the pitch amplitude remained nearly constant at 38.2 degrees. The combined effect is that the flapping-wing robot benefited from the angle of attack that is characteristic of flying animals. Our results suggest that it is not a simple increase in the flapping frequency, but a coordinated increase in the wing size and reduction in flapping frequency enables the flight in lower density condition. The key mechanism is to preserve the passive rotations due to wing deformation, confirmed by a bioinspired scaling relationship. Our results highlight the feasibility of flight under a low-density, high-altitude environment due to leveraging unsteady aerodynamic mechanisms unique to flapping wings. We anticipate our experimental demonstration to be a starting point for more sophisticated flapping wing models and robots for autonomous multi-altitude sensing. Furthermore, it is a preliminary step towards flapping wing flight in the ultra-low density Martian atmosphere.",

      "abstract": "Autonomous buses are expected to expand the mobility-on-demand options in cities in the next 10 years. An essential aspect of ensuring optimal usage of fleets of autonomous buses is the task of scheduling. This paper presents a scheduling approach based on the construction of all possible trips used to formulate an optimization problem. While in the past most research is focused on the scheduling of taxi trips, there is an increasing interest in the research for the scheduling of last-mile travel options. A street network has been generated based on open street map data as a basis for the scheduling. All possible combinations of buses and requests are calculated, and for each of those trips, a close to optimal order of requests is created. These are used to formulate the optimization problem, calculating a close to optimal assignment of requests on the buses. The approach has considered constraints such as maximum waiting time, travel delay, and targets to exploit shared trips for higher efficiency. Experiments have been carried out in a simulated environment of a university campus area with fleets of up to 10 vehicles. By performing various trials with changing parameters, the influence of the constraints on waiting time and travel delay to the scheduling is determined. Depending on the setup, service rates above 90%, while trails with strict constraints show that the approach can handle short-term requests. Based on the results, a use case-specific composition of the autonomous bus fleet can be done. \u00c2\u00a9 2023 Elsevier B.V.",

      "abstract": "Blockchain technology and the Internet of Medical Things (IoMT) have garnered increased attention recently due to their growing application in effectively managing data security, storage, and transmission concerns within healthcare organizations. However, integrating various advancements, such as coordination, adaptivity, and automated responses, within the framework of blockchain-based IoMT has amplified its susceptibility to a range of attacks and vulnerabilities. Assessing and enhancing the resilience of blockchain-based IoMT is of utmost importance, particularly in anticipation of potential disruptions, to ensure its continuous and sustainable functionality. The stochastic nature of risks adds complexity to evaluating the resilience of blockchain-based IoMT, given that resilience in this domain may fluctuate over time. This study employs a dynamic Bayesian network (DBN) method to address the evolving characteristics of pertinent variables, capturing their temporal dependencies and demonstrating how the resilience capabilities of blockchain-based IoMT may evolve across different time intervals. Additionally, an information theory approach is adopted to mitigate uncertainty regarding the resilience performance of blockchain-based IoMT and its crucial subcomponents. This research showcases the effectiveness and adaptability of the DBN methodology in healthcare systems, offering insights for shaping appropriate and essential strategies for decision-makers to establish a highly resilient framework for blockchain-based IoMT. \u00c2\u00a9 2023 The Authors",

To circumvent this impediment, we propose to intelligently exchange critical information among agents for assisting their decision-making. We first formulate a problem for maximizing the number of offloaded tasks and the offloading fairness by optimizing the trajectory of UAVs. We then conceive a multi-agent deep reinforcement learning (DRL) framework by harnessing communication among agents, and design a communication-assisted decentralized trajectory control algorithm based on value-decomposition networks (VDN) for fully exploiting the benefits of messages exchange among agents. Simulation results demonstrate the superiority of the proposed algorithm over the state-of-the-art DRL-based algorithms. \u00c2\u00a9 2012 IEEE.",

Here, we describe the construction of biodegradable metal\u2013organic framework based nanobots with chemically driven buoyancy to achieve highly efficient, long-distance, directional vertical motion to \u201cfind-and-fetch\u201d target cells. Nanobots surface-functionalized with antibodies against the cell surface marker carcinoembryonic antigen are exploited to impart the nanobots with specific cell targeting capacity to recognize and separate cancer cells. We demonstrate that the self-propelled motility of the nanobots can sufficiently transport the recognized cells autonomously, and the separated cells can be easily collected with a customized glass column, and finally regain their full metabolic potential after the separation. The utilization of nanobots with easy synthetic pathway shows considerable promise in cell recognition, separation, and enrichment.",

This paper presents an architecture solution that leverages heterogeneous platforms and virtualization technologies to support AI-powered applications consisting of modules with mixed criticalities and safety requirements. The hypervisor exploits the security features of the Xilinx ZCU104 MPSoCs to create two isolated execution environments: a high performance domain running deep learning algorithms under the Linux operating system and a safety-critical domain running control and monitoring functions under the freeRTOS real-time operating system. The proposed approach is validated by a use case consisting of an unmanned aerial vehicle capable of tracking moving targets using a deep neural network accelerated on the FGPA available on the platform.",

The algorithm differs from existing approaches for fixed-wing trajectory generation, as it considers a realistic six-degree-of-freedom (6-DOF) flight dynamics model, including aerodynamic equations. Using a global dynamics model enables the generation of aerobatics trajectories that exploit the entire flight envelope, allowing agile maneuvering through the stall regime, sideways uncoordinated flight, inverted flight, etc. The method uses the differential flatness property of the global tailsitter flying wing dynamics, which is derived in this work. By performing snap minimization in the differentially flat output space, a computationally efficient algorithm, suitable for online motion planning, is obtained. The algorithm is demonstrated in extensive flight experiments encompassing six aerobatic maneuvers, a time-optimal drone racing trajectory, and an airshowlike aerobatic sequence for three tailsitter aircraft. \u00c2\u00a9 2004-2012 IEEE.",

      "abstract": "Autonomous decision-making in unmanned aerial vehicle (UVA) confrontations presents challenges in making optimal strategy. Therefore, deep reinforcement learning (DRL) has been adopted to address these issues. However, existing DRL decision-making models suffer from poor situational awareness and inability to distinguish between different intentions. Therefore, a multi-intent autonomous decision-making is proposed in this paper. First, three typical intentions are designed comprising head-on attacking, pursuing and fleeing to derive decision models representing different intentions. Reinforcement learning based air combat game model is constructed with different intentions, which contains designing reward functions for intentions to deal with the problem of sparse rewards. Then, we propose the Temporal Proximal Policy Optimization (T-PPO) algorithm, which optimizes the Proximal Policy Optimization algorithm by integrating the long short-term memory network and feedforward neural network. This algorithm extracts the historical temporal information to enhance situational awareness. In addition, a basic-confrontation progressive training method is proposed to provide intention guidance and increase training diversity, which can improve learning efficiency and intelligent decision-making capability. Finally, experiments in our constructed UAV confrontation environment demonstrate that the proposed intentional decision models exhibit good performance in stability and learning efficiency, achieving high rewards, win rates, and low steps. Specifically, our autonomous decision-making increases win rate by 26% when head-on attacking and learning efficiency by 50% when pursuing. It is further proof of the potential and value of our multi-intent autonomous decision-making applications.",

      "abstract": "Biomass accumulation as a growth indicator can be significant in achieving high and stable soybean yields. More robust genotypes have a better potential for exploiting available resources such as water or sunlight. Biomass data implemented as a new trait in soybean breeding programs could be beneficial in the selection of varieties that are more competitive against weeds and have better radiation use efficiency. The standard techniques for biomass determination are invasive, inefficient, and restricted to one-time point per plot. Machine learning models (MLMs) based on the multispectral (MS) images were created so as to overcome these issues and provide a non-destructive, fast, and accurate tool for in-season estimation of soybean fresh biomass (FB). The MS photos were taken during two growing seasons of 10 soybean varieties, using six-sensor digital camera mounted on the unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV). For model calibration, canopy cover (CC), plant height (PH), and 31 vegetation index (VI) were extracted from the images and used as predictors in the random forest (RF) and partial least squares regression (PLSR) algorithm. To create a more efficient model, highly correlated VIs were excluded and only the triangular greenness index (TGI) and green chlorophyll index (GCI) remained. More precise results with a lower mean absolute error (MAE) were obtained with RF (MAE\u2009=\u20090.17\u00a0kg/m2) compared to the PLSR (MAE\u2009=\u20090.20\u00a0kg/m2). High accuracy in the prediction of soybean FB was achieved using only four predictors (CC, PH and two VIs). The selected model was additionally tested in a two-year trial on an independent set of soybean genotypes in drought simulation environments. The results showed that soybean grown under drought conditions accumulated less biomass than the control, which was expected due to the limited resources. The research proved that soybean FB could be successfully predicted using UAV photos and MLM. The filtration of highly correlated variables reduced the final number of predictors, improving the efficiency of remote biomass estimation. The additional testing conducted in the independent environment proved that model is capable to distinguish different values of soybean FB as a consequence of drought. Assessed variability in FB indicates the robustness and effectiveness of the proposed model, as a novel tool for the non-destructive estimation of soybean FB.",

In the present study, we aimed to describe the epidemiology of reported cases infected with P. malariae in the past decade to raise awareness of the potential threat of this malaria parasite in China. Individual data of malaria cases infected with P. malariae reported in China in the past decade were collected via the China Information System for Disease Control and Prevention and Parasitic Diseases Information Reporting Management System, to explore their epidemiological characteristics. Pearson Chi-square tests or Fisher\u2019s Exact Test was used in the statistical analysis. From 2013 to 2022, a total of 581 P. malariae cases were reported in China, and mainly concentrated in 20\u201359\u00a0years old group (P\u2009<\u20090.001), and there was no significant trend in the number of cases reported per month. Moreover, four kinds of P. malariae cases were classified, including 567 imported cases from 41 countries in 8 regions and distributed in 27 provinces (autonomous regions, municipalities) in China, six indigenous cases in a small outbreak in Hainan, seven recurrent cases in Guangdong and Shanghai, and one induced case in Shanghai, respectively. In addition, only 379 cases (65.2%) were diagnosed as malaria on the first visit (P\u2009<\u20090.001), and 413 cases (71.1%) were further confirmed as P. malariae cases (P\u2009=\u20090.002). Meanwhile, most cases sought healthcare first in the health facilities at the county and prefectural levels, but only 76.7% (161/210) and 73.7% (146/198) cases were diagnosed as malaria, and the accuracy of confirmed diagnosis as malaria cases infected with P. malariae was only 77.2% (156/202) and 69.9% (167/239) in these health facilities respectively. Even though malaria cases infected with P. malariae didn\u2019t account for a high proportion of reported malaria cases nationwide, the threat posed by widely distributed imported cases, a small number of indigenous cases, recurrent cases and induced case cannot be ignored in China. Therefore, it is necessary to raise awareness and improve the surveillance and response to the non-falciparum species such as P. malariae, and prevent the reestablishment of malaria transmission after elimination. \n                  \n                    \n                  \n                ",

Observations of Coots in different water temperatures (n\u2009=\u20092354) were compiled during 31 flights in January\u2013March, 2020. Coots were actively swimming during 82.3% of the observations, fleeing during 8.1%, and sedentary in water during 9.6%. The population spent more time swimming in cooler water and were sedentary for longer in warmer water. The only instance of uniform behavior occurred during an anomalously cold period in which Coots stood huddled in the warmest available water. Using a linear model framework, we found that Coot time spent increased with water temperature when heat index decreased. Coots\u2019 swim paths deviated away from warmer water more than cooler water and more so as heat index increased. We suggest that Coots use the spring water primarily for ice-free habitat and maintain metabolic rates via a combination of thermal conductance, caloric ingestion, and exercise, but only exploit the heated water strictly for thermoregulation during anomalously cold periods. We discuss the benefits and hindrances of using UASs amidst a rapidly expanding assortment of sensors and aircraft available to researchers. Given wetlands\u2019 immediate conservation concern, ecosystem services they provide, and support of unique species assemblages, our research provides valuable insight into documenting wildlife\u2019s use of wetlands with relatively low scientific take and human interference.",

      "abstract": "Forest degradation is a major threat to tropical forests, and effective monitoring using remotely sensed data is subject to significant challenges. In particular, consistent methods for detecting subtle changes in the forest canopy structure caused by selective logging are lacking. Here, using a unique dataset collected in southeastern Cameroon, covering over 22,000 ha of monthly harvesting areas, >6000 locations of harvested trees, and an independent canopy gap dataset developed from an uninhabited aerial vehicle flight (UAV; RGB camera) of approximately 1500 ha, a new method was designed to monitor canopy disturbance and logging intensity in Central Africa. Using Sentinel-1 synthetic aperture radar (SAR) data, the method was conceptualised using a two-step, two-scale approach, which better matched logging practices. First, (non-)harvesting activity areas were identified using textural indices at a spatial resolution of 300 m (step 1), and within these harvesting activity areas, canopy gaps were detected at a resolution of 10 m (step 2). Both steps were based on monthly differences in the Sentinel-1 SAR time series computed using the average of the 12 months preceding and the average of the three months following the month of interest. This method identified harvesting activity areas (step 1 at 300 m resolution) of over 12,004 km2 with high accuracy (omission and commission errors for both classes \u00e2\u0089\u00a40.05) and, within them, detected canopy gaps (step 2 at 10 m resolution) with a global accuracy of 0.89. Although some canopy gaps were subject to omission and commission errors (0.39 and 0.05, respectively), this method yielded better results than other available approaches. Compared to the UAV canopy gaps, this method detected most of the small gaps (\u00e2\u0089\u00a4 500 m2), which represent 80% of all disturbed areas, whereas other available approaches missed at least 70% of these and consequently missed most of the disturbance events occurring in a selectively logged forest. Furthermore, the predictions were correlated with logging intensity, i.e., the number of trees and volume cut per hectare, which are two important criteria for assessing the sustainability of logging activities. This two-step two-scale method for short-term, monthly monitoring of logging disturbances and intensity has strong practical implications for forest administration and certification bodies in Central Africa. \u00c2\u00a9 2023 The Authors",

      "abstract": "In recent years, unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) have undergoing experienced remarkable advancements. Nevertheless, the growing utilization of UAVs brings forth potential security threats to the public, particularly in private and sensitive locales. To address these emerging hazards, we introduce a low-cost, three-stage UAV detection framework for monitoring invading UAVs in vulnerable zones. This framework devised through an exhaustive investigation of the Chinese UAV market. Various scenarios were examined to evaluate the effectiveness of the framework, and it was subsequently implemented on a portable board. Experiments demonstrated that the proposed framework can detect invading UAVs at an early stage, even in stealthy mode. As such, the framework has the potential to be applied in the formulation of a portable surveillance system for a UAV-restricted region.",

      "abstract": "Agriculture is an essential sector needed for survival of the human community. Several measures have been taken to enhance the crop production. However harsh environmental conditions and frequent pest infestation lead to the agricultural loss. In such scenario, integration of advanced technologies such as advanced sensors coupled with Internet of Things (IoT) could escalate the agricultural production and minimize the economic loss. Studies have been conducted across the world that satisfactorily demonstrated the implication of integrated IoT-smart sensors in monitoring environmental factors such as moisture, humidity, temperature, and soil composition that are critical for crop growth. Green house gases such as Carbon dioxide, Methane, etc., are also measured through automated sensors. Smart farming also enables measurement of nitrogen contents in soil that helps farmers to determine the amount of fertilizers to be used in farm lands. Some IoT-enabled equipments and unmanned aerial vehicles are useful in accurate surveillance of pest attack and associated diseases in farm vegetation. Though the smart farming has great scopes in future, it faces certain limitations related to high implementation cost, data security, and lack of sufficient digital knowledge in farmers. Special economic policies, data encryption, and digital literacy could ease IoT-enabled smart farming in future. \u00c2\u00a9 2023 The Author(s)",

      "abstract": "Dormant pruning is an important orchard activity for maintaining tree health and producing high-quality fruit. Due to decreasing worker availability, pruning is a prime candidate for robotics. However, pruning also represents a uniquely difficult problem, requiring robust systems for perception, pruning point determination, and manipulation that must operate under variable lighting conditions and in complex, highly unstructured environments. In this article, we introduce a system for pruning modern planar orchard architectures with simple pruning rules that combines various subsystems from our previous work on perception and manipulation. The integrated system demonstrates the ability to autonomously detect and cut pruning targets with minimal control of the environment, laying the groundwork for a fully autonomous system in the future. We validate the performance of our system through field trials in a sweet cherry orchard, ultimately achieving a cutting success rate of 58% across 10 trees. Though not fully robust and requiring improvements in throughput, our system is the first to operate on fruit trees and represents a useful base platform to be improved in the future. \u00c2\u00a9 1994-2011 IEEE.",

      "abstract": "Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is a major threat to public health worldwide. The relationship between CVD and temperature has been widely reported in developed countries and regions. However, there are few studies of severe CVD in poor rural areas of developing countries. Therefore, this study aimed to explore the relationship between CVD and apparent temperature (AT) in a rural area of Linxia Hui Autonomous Prefecture, China. Daily CVD admission data and meteorological data were collected from Linxia between 2014 and 2015. The media of AT was used as the reference temperature to estimate the cumulative relative risk (RR) of CVD admission. The distributed lag non-linear models were used to examine the association between AT and cumulative RR of CVD admission at lag 0\u201321&nbsp;days. In Linxia, high AT (20&nbsp;\u00b0C) had a persistent adverse effect on cumulative RR of CVD admissions, and the RR increased with increasing lag days. Cold (\u2212\u200910&nbsp;\u00b0C) had a protective effect on the first and later lag days (lag 0\u201314 and lag 0\u201321). Adults (aged\u2009&lt;\u200965&nbsp;years) and females were more susceptible to the effects of heat than males and the elderly (aged\u2009\u2265\u200965&nbsp;years).

      "abstract": "Decision-making is the \u201cbrain\u201d of connected and automated vehicles (CAVs) and is vitally critical to the safety of CAVs. The most of driving data used to train the decision-making algorithms is collected in general traffic conditions. Existing decision-making methods are difficult to guarantee safety in challenging traffic conditions, namely severe congestion and accident ahead. In this context, a semi-supervised decision-making algorithm is proposed to improve the safety of CAVs in challenging traffic conditions. To be specific, we proposed the expert-generative adversarial imitation learning (E-GAIL) that integrates imitation learning and deep reinforcement learning. The proposed E-GAIL is deployed in roadside unit (RSU). In the first stage, the decision-making knowledge of the expert is imitated using the real-world data collected in general traffic conditions. In the second stage, the generator of E-GAIL is further reinforced and achieves self-learn decision-making in the simulator with challenging traffic conditions. The E-GAIL is tested in general and challenging traffic conditions. By comparing the evaluation metrics of time to collision (TTC), deceleration to avoid a crash (DRAC), space gap (SGAP) and time gap (TGAP), the E-GAIL greatly outperforms the state-of-the-art decision-making algorithms. Experimental results show that the E-GAIL not only make-decision for CAVs in general traffic conditions but also successfully enhances the safety of CAVs in challenging traffic conditions.",

      "abstract": "In unmanned vehicle perception, dynamic object classification is applied to classify objects accurately and timely, providing decision-making for obstacle avoidance and planning. Low-resolution LiDAR is one of the most important sensors for this task. Unfortunately, the existing approaches perform unsatisfactorily due to the huge domain gap between low-resolution and high-resolution point cloud classification. Some schemes try to reduce the gap by fusing multi-scan information through SLAM or completing single-scan point clouds. However, these methods rely on high positioning accuracy or the wholeness of object data. To this end, differently, we propose a dynamic object classification method of low-resolution data from the perspective of time-series fusion. By modeling time series of sparse data, we indicate change rules of separate classification models for object representation. Subsequently, based on ensemble learning, our method performs feature-level fusion on multiple networks to exploit their different expression capabilities. Finally, we utilize long short-term memory to gradually classify dynamic objects. Besides, we also propose a dataset of the low-resolution point clouds and manually annotate the ground truth, which contains abundant samples of cars, pedestrians, and motorcycles. Through testing actual low-resolution data, the accuracy of our method is verified to improve a lot than the state-of-the-art approaches. \u00c2\u00a9 2016 IEEE.",

      "abstract": "In the past few years COVID-19 posed a huge threat to healthcare systems around the world. One of the first waves of the pandemic hit Northern Italy severely resulting in high casualties and in the near breakdown of primary care. Due to these facts, the Covid CXR Hackathon\u2014Artificial Intelligence for Covid-19 prognosis: aiming at accuracy and explainability challenge had been launched at the beginning of February 2022, releasing a new imaging dataset with additional clinical metadata for each accompanying chest X-ray (CXR). In this article we summarize our techniques at correctly diagnosing chest X-ray images collected upon admission for severity of COVID-19 outcome. In addition to X-ray imagery, clinical metadata was provided and the challenge also aimed at creating an explainable model. We created a best-performing, as well as, an explainable model that makes an effort to map clinical metadata to image features whilst predicting the prognosis. We also did many ablation studies in order to identify crucial parts of the models and the predictive power of each feature in the datasets. We conclude that CXRs at admission do not help the predicting power of the metadata significantly by itself and contain mostly information that is also mutually present in the blood samples and other clinical factors collected at admission.",

      "abstract": "Prospective customers are becoming more concerned about safety and comfort as the automobile industry swings toward automated vehicles (AVs). A comprehensive evaluation of recent AVs collision data indicates that modern automated driving systems are prone to rear-end collisions, usually leading to multiple-vehicle collisions. Moreover, most investigations into severe traffic conditions are confined to single-vehicle collisions. This work reviewed diverse techniques of existing literature to provide planning procedures for multiple vehicle cooperation and collision avoidance (MVCCA) strategies in AVs while also considering their performance and social impact viewpoints. Firstly, we investigate and tabulate the existing MVCCA techniques associated with single-vehicle collision avoidance perspectives. Then, current achievements are extensively evaluated, challenges and flows are identified, and remedies are intelligently formed to exploit a taxonomy. This paper also aims to give readers an AI-enabled conceptual framework and a decision-making model with a concrete structure of the training network settings to bridge the gaps between current investigations. These findings are intended to shed insight into the benefits of the greater efficiency of AVs set-up for academics and policymakers. Lastly, the open research issues discussed in this survey will pave the way for the actual implementation of driverless automated traffic systems.",

      "abstract": "Sensor fusion is an important component of the perception system in autonomous driving, and the fusion of radar point cloud information and camera visual information can improve the perception capability of autonomous vehicles. However, most of the existing studies ignore the extraction of local neighborhood information and only consider shallow fusion between the two modalities based on the extracted global information, which cannot perform a deep fusion of cross-modal contextual information interaction. Meanwhile, in data preprocessing, the noise in radar data is usually only filtered by the depth information derived from image feature prediction, and such methods affect the accuracy of radar branching to generate regions of interest and cannot effectively filter out irrelevant information of radar points. This paper proposes the CenterTransFuser model that makes full use of millimeter-wave radar point cloud information and visual information to enable cross-modal fusion of the two heterogeneous information. Specifically, a new interaction called cross-transformer is explored, which cooperatively exploits cross-modal cross-multiple attention and joint cross-multiple attention to mine radar and image complementary information. Meanwhile, an adaptive depth thresholding filtering method is designed to reduce the noise of radar modality-independent information projected onto the image. The CenterTransFuser model is evaluated on the challenging nuScenes dataset, and it achieves excellent performance. Particularly, the detection accuracy is significantly improved for pedestrians, motorcycles, and bicycles, showing the superiority and effectiveness of the proposed model.",

      "abstract": "Attacks on health care represent an area of growing international concern. Publicly available data are important in documenting attacks, and are often the only easily accessible data source. Data collection processes about attacks on health and their implications have received little attention, despite the fact that datasets and their collection processes may result in differing numbers. Comparing two separate datasets compiled using publicly-available data revealed minimal overlap. This article aims to explain the reasons for the lack of overlap, to better understand the gaps and their implications.\n We compared the data collection processes for datasets comprised of publicly-reported attacks on health care from the World Health Organization (WHO) and Insecurity Insight\u2019s Security in Numbers Database\u00a0(SiND). We compared each individual event to compile a comparable dataset and identify unique and matched events in order to determine the overlap between them. We report descriptive statistics for this comparison. We identified a common dataset of 287 events from 2017, of which only 33 appeared in both datasets, resulting in a mere 12.9% (n\u2009=\u2009254) overlap. Events affecting personnel and facilities appeared most often in both, and 22 of 31 countries lacked any overlap between datasets. We conclude that the minimal overlap suggests significant underreporting of attacks on health care, and furthermore, that dataset definitions and parameters affect data collection. Source variation appears to best explain the discrepancies and closer comparison of the collection processes reveal weaknesses of both automated and manual data collection that rely on hidden curation processes. To generate more accurate datasets compiled from public sources requires systematic work to translate definitions into effective online search mechanisms to better capture the full range of events, and to increase the diversity of languages and local sources to better capture events across geographies.",

      "abstract": "Target detection and sonar contact classification with active sonar systems are not trivial especially when operating in coastal and shallow water environments with multipath propagation, high reverberation and clutter. It is even more difficult when the sonar receiver is hosted on unmanned platforms with limited maneuvering capabilities unable to perform long-lasting tracking procedures. In such environments with high clutter density, real-time classification algorithms to discriminate target contacts from clutter contacts become crucial. This paper describes a method for active sonar clutter classification that exploits the large number of undesired contacts to learn the \u201cfingerprint\u201d of the environmental clutter and thus to identify the target contacts as anomalies. The paper introduces the method to obtain the features of detected sonar contacts from the beamformed signal of a triplet array of hydrophones that can be towed by an autonomous underwater vehicle. The paper also shows the performance of the proposed unsupervised classification algorithm with real data collected at sea and compares it to what has been achieved by using a convolutional neural network. The results show the capability of the proposed anomaly detection algorithm to properly deal with a variety of clutter contacts without requiring labeling of training data.",

In order to realized real-time perception and accurate judgment of coal-rock cutting state information, this paper combined the field test sampling, construction technology of complex coal seam, virtual prototype technology, bidirectional coupling technology, data processing theory, image fusion method, and deep learning theory to carry out multi domain deep fusion experimental research on multi-source heterogeneous data of coal and rock cutting state. The typical complex coal seam containing gangue, inclusion, and minor fault in Yangcun mine of Yanzhou mining area was taken as the engineering object. The high-precision three-dimensional simulation model of the complex coal seam that can update and replace particles was constructed. Based on the simulation results of Discrete Element Method-Multi Flexible Body Dynamics (DEM-MFBD), the one-dimensional original vibration acceleration signals of the key components of the shearer cutting part were determined, including spiral drum, rocker arm shell, and square head. After transforming one-dimensional original signal data into two-dimensional time\u2013frequency images by Short-time Fourier Transform, morphological wavelet image fusion technology was used to realize the effective fusion of characteristic information of spiral drum, rocker arm shell, and square head under different working conditions. Based on the deep learning theory, the DCGAN-RFCNN (Deep Convolutional Generative Adversarial Networks-Random Forest Convolutional Neural Networks) coal and rock cutting state recognition network model was constructed. Combining convolution neural network with random forest recognition classifier, RFCNN coal and rock cutting state recognition classification model was constructed, and the recognition network model was trained to obtain the model recognition results. Through the comparative experimental analysis of the RFCNN network model with different recognition network models and different synthetic sample numbers in the recognition network, the effectiveness of the recognition network model was verified. The results show that: When synthetic samples are not included in each working condition in the RFCNN model, the average recognition rate is 90.641%. With the increase of the number of synthetic samples, the recognition rate of coal and rock cutting state increases. When the number of synthetic samples added to each working condition reaches 5000, the recognition effect is the best, and the average recognition rate reaches 98.344%, which verifies the superiority of enriching the data set by using the improved DCGAN network. Also, the RFCNN outperformed the other variants: it obtained higher recognition accuracy by 25.085, 21.925 and 19.337%, respectively, over SVW, CNN, and AlexNet. Also, the experimental platform of shearer cutting coal and rock was built, where the coal and rock cutting state recognition network was trained and tested based on the migration learning theory. Through the statistical test results, the accuracy of coal and rock cutting state recognition is 98.64%, which realizes the accurate recognition of coal and rock cutting state.",

The operative principles of autonomous vehicles depend heavily on their ability to collect data from the environment via integrated sensors, then employ DNN classification to interpret them and make operative decisions. The security and the reliability of DNNs raise many challenges and concerns for researchers. One of those challenges currently in the research domain is the threat of adversarial attacks on DNNs. In this survey, we present state-of-the-art research on DNN frameworks, adversarial attacks, and defenses. We discuss each work along with its advantages and limitations and present our thoughts on and future directions for adversarial attacks and defenses.",

      "abstract": "Sudden cardiac arrest (SCA) consisting of ventricular fibrillation and ventricular tachycardia considered as shockable rhythms is a life-threatening heart disease, which is treated efficiently by the automated external defibrillator (AED). This work proposes a novel design of the SAA, which includes a k-nearest neighbors model and a subset of 8 features extracted from the ECG segments, for the SCA diagnosis on the electrocardiogram (ECG) signal. These features are addressed as the most productive subset among 31 input features based on the evaluation of the feature correlation. The recursive feature elimination algorithm combined with the Boosting model and wise-patient fivefold cross-validation method is adopted for the calculation of the average feature importance, which shows the degree of feature correlation, to construct various input feature subsets. Moreover, component feature combinations known as the representatives of the input feature subsets with an enormous level of correlation and independence are transformed from the input subsets by the principal component analysis method. The wise-patient fivefold cross-validation procedure is used for the evaluation of these component feature combinations on the validation set. The proposed SAA is certainly efficient for SCA detection with a small number of the extracted feature and relatively high diagnosis performance such as accuracy of 99.52%, sensitivity of 97.69%, and specificity of 99.91%.",

      "abstract": "Neurobiological systems continually interact with the surrounding environment to refine their behaviour toward the best possible reward. Achieving such learning by experience is one of the main challenges of artificial intelligence, but currently it is hindered by the lack of hardware capable of plastic adaptation. Here, we propose a bio-inspired recurrent neural network, mastered by a digital system on chip with resistive-switching synaptic arrays of memory devices, which exploits homeostatic Hebbian learning for improved efficiency. All the results are discussed experimentally and theoretically, proposing a conceptual framework for benchmarking the main outcomes in terms of accuracy and resilience. To test the proposed architecture for reinforcement learning tasks, we study the autonomous exploration of continually evolving environments and verify the results for the Mars rover navigation. We also show that, compared to conventional deep learning techniques, our in-memory hardware has the potential to achieve a significant boost in speed and power-saving. A big challenge for artificial intelligence is to gain the ability of learning by experience like biological systems. Here Bianchi et al. propose a hardware neural network based on resistive-switching synaptic arrays which dynamically adapt to the environment for autonomous exploration.",

      "abstract": "Thrombotic cerebro-cardiovascular diseases are the leading causes of disability and death worldwide. However, current drug therapeutics are compromised by narrow therapeutic windows, unsatisfactory thrombolysis effects, severe bleeding events, and high recurrence rates. In this study, we exploit a self-propelling nano-penetrator with high fuel loading and controllable motion features, which is molecularly co-assembled using a photothermal photosensitizer (DiR) and a photothermal-activable NO donor (BNN6). The precisely engineered nano-penetrator of the BNN6-DiR fuel pair shows distinct advantages in terms of NO productivity and autonomous motion under laser irradiation. In animal models of artery/vein thrombosis and acute ischemic stroke, the self\u2010fueled nano-penetrator enables self-navigated thrombus-homing accumulation, self-propelled clot deep penetration, fluorescence image-guided photothermal/mechanical thrombolysis, and NO-mediated prevention of thrombosis recurrence and acute ischemic stroke salvage. As expected, the molecularly self-fueled nano-penetrator displayed favorable therapeutic outcomes without bleeding risk compared to the clinically available thrombolytic drug. This study offers a facile, safe, and effective nonpharmaceutical modality towards the clinical treatment of thrombosis and ischemic stroke. Thrombotic cerebro-cardiovascular diseases are the leading causes of disability and death worldwide but current drug therapeutics show important limitations.

      "abstract": "Safe decision-making strategy of autonomous vehicles (AVs) plays a critical role in avoiding accidents. This study develops a safe reinforcement learning (safe-RL)-based driving policy for AVs on highways. The hierarchical framework is considered for the proposed safe-RL, where an upper layer executes a safe exploration-exploitation by modifying the exploring process of the \u03b5-greedy algorithm, and a lower layer utilizes a finite state machine (FSM) approach to establish the safe conditions for state transitions. The proposed safe-RL-based driving policy improves the vehicle\u2019s safe driving ability using a Q-table that stores the values corresponding to each action state. Moreover, owing to the trade-off between the \u03b5-greedy values and safe distance threshold, the simulation results demonstrate the superior performance of the proposed approach compared to other alternative RL approaches, such as the \u03b5-greedy Q-learning (GQL) and decaying \u03b5-greedy Q-learning (DGQL), in an uncertain traffic environment. This study\u2019s contributions are twofold: it improves the autonomous vehicle\u2019s exploration-exploitation and safe driving ability while utilizing the advantages of FSM when surrounding cars are inside safe-driving zones, and it analyzes the impact of safe-RL parameters in exploring the environment safely.",

      "abstract": "Gastrointestinal helminth parasites continue to be a significant threat to the health of equine. OvaCyte Telenostic (OCT) (Telenostic Ltd., Kilkenny, Ireland) has developed an automated digital microscope utilising Artificial Intelligence to identify and count the clinically important helminth species in equine, bovine, and ovine host species. In this paper, the performance of the OCT analyser was evaluated for the detection and counting of equine helminth species parasites and its performance compared to the currently accepted benchmark methods of faecal egg counts being the McMaster and the Mini-FLOTAC techniques. A pairwise comparison of tests was assessed based on the correlation of egg counts and Cohen\u2019s kappa agreement statistics for dichotomized outcomes. Bayesian latent class analysis was used to estimate the sensitivity and specificity of all three techniques in the absence of a gold standard for four helminth parasites (strongyles, Anoplocephala spp., Parascaris spp. and Strongyloides westeri). Based on the analysis of 783 equine faecal samples, we found a high level (\u03c1 \u2265 0.94) of correlation between each pairwise comparison of techniques for strongyle egg counts. Cohen\u2019s kappa agreement between techniques was high for strongyles and S. westeri, moderate for Parascaris spp., and low for Anoplocephala spp. All three techniques had a high sensitivity and specificity (>0.90) for strongyles. Across helminth parasites, the sensitivity of the OCT was the highest of the three techniques evaluated for strongyles (0.98 v 0.96 and 0.94), Anoplocephala spp. (0.86 v 0.44 and 0.46) and Parascaris spp. (0.96 v 0.83 and 0.96); but lowest for S. westeri (0.74 v 0.88 and 0.88), compared to McMaster and Mini-FLOTAC, respectively. In terms of specificity, OCT was the lowest in two species (Parascaris spp. 0.96, Anoplocephala spp. 0.95). In conclusion, OCT has a sensitivity and specificity statistically similar to both McMaster and Mini-FLOTAC, and had a higher correlation with Mini-FLOTAC. The OCT point of care faecal analyser offers improved workflow, test turn-around time and does not require trained laboratory personnel to operate or interpret the results",

      "abstract": "To address the fuzzy reconstruction effect on distant objects in unbounded scenes and the difficulty in feature matching caused by the thin structure of power lines in images, this paper proposes a novel image-based method for the reconstruction of power transmission lines (PTLs). The dataset used in this paper comprises PTL progressive motion sequence datasets, constructed by a visual acquisition system carried by a developed Flying\u2013walking Power Line Inspection Robot (FPLIR). This system captures close-distance and continuous images of power lines. The study introduces PL-NeRF, that is, an enhanced method based on the Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) method for reconstructing PTLs. The highlights of PL-NeRF include (1) compressing the unbounded scene of PTLs by exploiting the spatial compression of normal L\u221e; (2) encoding the direction and position of the sample points through Integrated Position Encoding (IPE) and Hash Encoding (HE), respectively. Compared to existing methods, the proposed method demonstrates good performance in 3D reconstruction, with fidelity indicators of PSNR = 29, SSIM = 0.871, and LPIPS = 0.087. Experimental results highlight that the combination of PL-NeRF with progressive motion sequence images ensures the integrity and continuity of PTLs, improving the efficiency and accuracy of image-based reconstructions. In the future, this method could be widely applied for efficient and accurate 3D reconstruction and inspection of PTLs, providing a strong foundation for automated monitoring of transmission corridors and digital power engineering.",

      "abstract": "Weeds are one of the greatest threats to the growth of rice, and the loss of crops is greater in the early stage of rice growth. Traditional large-area spraying cannot selectively spray weeds and can easily cause herbicide waste and environmental pollution. To realize the transformation from large-area spraying to precision spraying in rice fields, it is necessary to quickly and efficiently detect the distribution of weeds. Benefiting from the rapid development of vision technology and deep learning, this study applies a computer vision method based on deep-learning-driven rice field weed target detection. To address the need to identify small dense targets at the rice seedling stage in paddy fields, this study propose a method for weed target detection based on YOLOX, which is composed of a CSPDarknet backbone network, a feature pyramid network (FPN) enhanced feature extraction network and a YOLO Head detector. The CSPDarknet backbone network extracts feature layers with dimensions of 80 pixels \u2286 80 pixels, 40 pixels \u2286 40 pixels and 20 pixels \u2286 20 pixels. The FPN fuses the features from these three scales, and YOLO Head realizes the regression of the object classification and prediction boxes. In performance comparisons of different models, including YOLOv3, YOLOv4-tiny, YOLOv5-s, SSD and several models of the YOLOX series, namely, YOLOX-s, YOLOX-m, YOLOX-nano, and YOLOX-tiny, the results show that the YOLOX-tiny model performs best. The mAP, F1, and recall values from the YOLOX-tiny model are 0.980, 0.95, and 0.983, respectively. Meanwhile, the intermediate variable memory generated during the model calculation of YOLOX-tiny is only 259.62 MB, making it suitable for deployment in intelligent agricultural devices. However, although the YOLOX-tiny model is the best on the dataset in this paper, this is not true in general. The experimental results suggest that the method proposed in this paper can improve the model performance for the small target detection of sheltered weeds and dense weeds at the rice seedling stage in paddy fields. A weed target detection model suitable for embedded computing platforms is obtained by comparing different single-stage target detection models, thereby laying a foundation for the realization of unmanned targeted herbicide spraying performed by agricultural robots.",

      "abstract": "The perception system is a safety-critical component that directly impacts the overall safety of autonomous driving systems (ADSs). It is imperative to ensure the robustness of the deep-learning model used in the perception system. However, studies have shown that these models are highly vulnerable to the adversarial perturbation of input data. The existing works mainly focused on studying the impact of these adversarial attacks on classification rather than regression models. Therefore, this paper first introduces two generalized methods for perturbation-based attacks: (1) We used naturally occurring noises to create perturbations in the input data. (2) We introduce a modified square, HopSkipJump, and decision-based/boundary attack to attack the regression models used in ADSs. Then, we propose a deep-autoencoder-based adversarial attack detector. In addition to offline evaluation metrics (e.g., F1 score and precision, etc.), we introduce an online evaluation framework to evaluate the robustness of the model under attack. The framework considers the reconstruction loss of the deep autoencoder that validates the robustness of the models under attack in an end-to-end fashion at runtime. Our experimental results showed that the proposed adversarial attack detector could detect square, HopSkipJump, and decision-based/boundary attacks with a true positive rate (TPR) of 93%.",

      "abstract": "As a core component of small unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), GPS is playing a critical role in providing localization for UAV navigation. UAVs are an important factor in the large-scale deployment of the Internet of Things (IoT) and cyber\u2013physical systems (CPS). However, GPS is vulnerable to spoofing attacks that can mislead a UAV to fly into a sensitive area and threaten public safety and private security. The conventional spoofing detection methods need too much overhead, which stops efficient detection from working in a computation-constrained UAV and provides an efficient response to attacks. In this paper, we propose a novel approach to obtain a lightweight detection model in the UAV system so that GPS spoofing attacks can be detected from a long distance. With long-short term memory (LSTM), we propose a lightweight detection model on the ground control stations, and then we distill it into a compact size that is able to run in the control system of the UAV with knowledge distillation. The experimental results show that our lightweight detection algorithm runs in UAV systems reliably and can achieve good performance in GPS spoofing detection.",

      "abstract": "With the continuous expansion of Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) applications, the threat of icing on UAV flights has garnered increased attention. Understanding the icing principles and developing anti-icing technologies for unmanned aircraft is a crucial step in mitigating the icing threat. However, existing research indicates that changes in Reynolds numbers have a significant impact on the physics of ice accretion. Icing studies on aircraft operating at high Reynolds numbers cannot be directly applied to unmanned aircraft, and mature anti-icing/deicing techniques for manned aircraft cannot be directly utilized for UAVs. This paper firstly provides a comprehensive overview of research on icing for fixed-wing UAVs, including various methods to study unmanned aircraft icing and the identified characteristics of icing on unmanned aircraft. Secondly, this paper focuses on discussing UAV anti-icing/deicing techniques, including those currently applied and under development, and examines the advantages and disadvantages of these techniques. Finally, the paper presents some recommendations regarding UAV icing research and the development of anti-icing/deicing techniques.",

      "abstract": "Cyber-physical systems (CPSs) are emergent systems that enable effective real-time communication and collaboration (C&C) of physical components such as control systems, sensors, actuators, and the surrounding environment through a cyber communication infrastructure. As such, autonomous vehicles (AVs) are one of the fields that have significantly adopted the CPS approach to improving people's lives in smart cities by reducing energy consumption and air pollution. Therefore, autonomous vehicle-cyber physical systems (AV-CPSs) have attracted enormous investments from major corporations and are projected to be widely used. However, AV-CPS is vulnerable to cyber and physical threat vectors due to the deep integration of information technology (IT), including cloud computing, with the communication process. Cloud computing is critical in providing the scalable infrastructure required for real-time data processing, storage, and analysis in AV-CPS, allowing these systems to work seamlessly in smart cities. CPS components such as sensors and control systems through network infrastructure are particularly vulnerable to cyber-attacks targeted by attackers using the communication system. This paper proposes an intelligent intrusion detection system (IIDS) for AV-CPS using transfer learning to identify cyberattacks launched against connected physical components of AVs through a network infrastructure. First, AV-CPS was developed by implementing the controller area network (CAN) and integrating it into the AV simulation model. Second, the dataset was generated from the AV-CPS. The collected dataset was then preprocessed to be trained and tested via pre-trained CNNs. Third, eight pre-trained networks were implemented, namely, InceptionV3, ResNet-50, ShuffleNet, MobileNetV2, GoogLeNet, ResNet-18, SqueezeNet, and AlexNet. The performance of the implemented models was evaluated. According to the experimental evaluation results, GoogLeNet outperformed all other pre-rained networks, scoring an F1- score of 99.47%.",

Semantic segmentation is an effective method for recognizing transmission pylon equipment. In this paper, a semantic segmentation algorithm that fuses infrared and natural light images is proposed. A cross-modal attention interaction activation mechanism is adopted to fully exploit the complementation between natural light and infrared images. Firstly, a global information block with a feature pyramid structure is used to deeply mine and fuse multi-scale global contextual information of fused features, and then the block is used to conduct feature aggregation in the decoding processing, and enough aggregation with multi-scale features of infrared and natural light images is used to enhance the expression ability of the model and improve the accuracy of semantic segmentation of transmission pylon equipment in complex scenes. Our method guides the process of low-level up-sampling and restoration by denser global and high-level features. Experimental results on a dataset of transmission pylon equipment collected by us show that the proposed method achieved better semantic segmentation results than the state-of-the-art methods.",

      "abstract": "To address the uncertainty in quantitative evaluation of autonomous capability of ground-attack UAVs, an evaluation method with the cloud model is proposed based on combined weightings. Based on the cognitive control structure, the evaluation index system of autonomous capability is constructed from five aspects: perceptual detection, planning and decision-making, combat execution, security management, and learning evolution. The one sidedness of determining the index weight by a single weighting method is overcome, using the combination weighting method based on game theory, and combined with the improved analytic hierarchy process and the improved entropy weight method to determine the combination weight. Considering the fuzziness and randomness of the autonomous capability evaluation process, an evaluation method based on cloud model is proposed for the autonomous capability of ground-attack UAVs, and the floating cloud algorithm is used to realize the effective synthesis of the evaluation index cloud. The simulation results of three ground-attack UAVs show that the proposed method considers both subjective and objective factors of the evaluation object, eliminates the limitations of a single weighting method, and achieves scientific and reasonable weight distribution. The quantitative evaluation of autonomous capability of the cloud model can effectively distinguish autonomous capability levels of different types of ground-attack UAVs, with accurate and reliable evaluation results. \u00c2\u00a9 2023 Beijing University of Aeronautics and Astronautics (BUAA).

      "abstract": "The specific features and requirements of island regions and rural areas make Mobility as a Service (MaaS) an attractive and evolving concept in the realm of Intercity/Rural/Island transportation. The primary goal of this research is to provide qualitative insights relative to the added value and development of MaaS for the previously mentioned transport services through a case study from Greece, a country with approximately 250 inhabited islands. In island settings, the primary societal motivation for MaaS is to enhance the accessibility of islands and improve individuals' access to multiple\u00a0transport services. MaaS is found to have a strong potential to act as an enabler for more efficient transport and better accessibility to remote/island locations, acting in a complementary manner with currently applied \u201cexternal\u201d measures such as the Greek \u201cTransport Equivalent\u201d. To further assess the potential, development and impact of MaaS a focus group comprised by key-representatives from industry and academia stakeholders is created. The MaaS Ecosystem, as described by the experts, is comprised of the MaaS Provider, all the intercity/rural/island transport providers currently operating in the Greek market, MaaS Enabling entities (associations, regulators, investors, research institutions), the Integration Drivers and the customers. The issue of transport providers\u2019 liability in case of disruptions and existing market regulations constitute, according to the results, an important challenge towards development of an Intercity MaaS, which needs to be addressed by legislative studies in a pan-European level. Most likely user groups for Intercity/Rural/Island MaaS are young people and digitally educated people, whilst less likely patronage groups are the elderly and \u201cvulnerable\u201d population groups. Relative to the external environment, high degree of fragmentation of the intercity transport industry combined by \u201cautonomous\u201d behavior of actors (\u201csilo effect\u201d) appears to be the greatest threat towards MaaS whilst anticipated capital investments in infrastructure and vehicles, which are foreseen in the proxime future, are the greatest opportunities.",

      "abstract": "As the deployment of Autonomous Vehicles (AVs) gains momentum, ensuring both security and accountability becomes paramount. This paper proposes a comprehensive approach to address these concerns. With the increasing importance of speaker identification, our first contribution lies in implementing a robust mechanism for identifying authorized users within AVs, enhancing security. To counter the threat of voice spoofing, an ensemble-based approach leveraging speaker verification techniques is presented, ensuring the authenticity of user commands. Furthermore, in scenarios of accidents involving AVs, the need for accurate accountability and liability allocation arises. To address this, we introduce a novel application of blockchain technology, enabling an event recording system that ensures transparent and tamper-proof records. The proposed system enhances AV security and establishes a framework for reliable accident investigation using speakers\u2019 records. In addition, this paper presents an innovative concept where vehicles act as impartial judges during accidents, utilizing location-based identification. Results show the viability of the proposed solution for accident investigation and analysis.",

      "abstract": "Maritime communications with sea surface reflections and sea wave occlusions are susceptible to jamming attacks due to the wide geographical area and intensive wireless communication services. Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) help relay messages to improve communication performance, but the relay policy that depends on the rapidly changing maritime environments is difficult to optimize. In this paper, a reinforcement learning-based UAV relay policy for maritime communications is proposed to resist jamming attacks. Based on previous transmission performance, the relay location, the received power of the transmitted signal and the received jamming power, this scheme optimizes the UAV trajectory and relay power to save the energy consumption and decrease the Bit-Error-Rate (BER) of the maritime signals. A deep reinforcement learning-based scheme is also proposed, which designs a deep neural network with dueling architecture to further improve the communication performance and computational complexity. The performance bounds regarding the signal to interference plus noise ratio, energy consumption and the communication utility are provided based on the Nash equilibrium of the game against jamming, and the computational complexity of the proposed schemes is analyzed. Simulation results show that the proposed schemes improve the energy efficiency and decrease the BER compared with the benchmark. \u00c2\u00a9 2022 Chongqing University of Posts and Telecommunications",

Moreover, the digital signature scheme should guarantee the real-time performance of UAVs executing commands and protect the signer\u2019s privacy. Therefore, we proposed an attribute-based proxy signature (ABPS) scheme supporting flexible threshold predicate for UAV networks and proved its security. It has existential unforgeability under selective-predicate and chosen message attacks (EUF-sP-CMA) and can protect the signer\u2019s privacy. We analyzed its computation costs based on experimental data and communication costs. The analysis results indicate that our ABPS scheme has less computation costs than other ABPS schemes and is at the same level as other ABPS schemes on communication costs.",

      "abstract": "In terms of flight conditions, the Martian atmospheric environment is undoubtedly much harsher than the Earth atmospheric environment, with extremely low air density, ultra-low Reynolds number, and raging Martian sandstorms, all of which have serious impacts on the design of Martian unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), especially for the design of the power system. The purpose of this paper is to study the impact of the Martian atmospheric environment on the aerodynamic performance of the propeller system. The computational fluid dynamics numerical simulation was used to study the impact of varying degrees of sand and dust accumulation on the aerodynamic performance of Martian propellers caused by Martian sandstorms and widespread dust. It was found that in the Martian atmospheric environment, the rough surface of propeller blades after sand and dust accumulation has better aerodynamic performance than the smooth surface, which is greatly different from the Earth environment; The aerodynamic characteristics of the propeller are tested in the simulated Martian atmosphere vacuum chamber environment, and the experiment has shown that the propeller has better aerodynamic performance under the condition of 8\u00c2\u00b0 angle of attack; under the condition of 8\u00c2\u00b0 angle of attack, the aerodynamic performance of the propeller is simulated by different Reynolds numbers and different Mach numbers, so as to obtain the influence of the Reynolds number and the Mach number on lift-drag characteristics under the Martian atmospheric environment, and then, the modified blead element theory suitable for the Martian atmospheric environment is derived, which provides a detailed reference for the accurate modeling of the Mars UAV. It has important guiding significance for the design of flight controller. \u00c2\u00a9 2023 Author(s).",

The rapid changes in Radar Cross Sections (RCSs), the unknown cruise trajectory of airborne radar, and the uncertain distribution of radars exacerbate the complexity of this problem. In this paper, we propose a novel UCAV trajectory planning method based on deep reinforcement learning (DRL) technology to overcome the adverse impacts caused by the dynamics and randomness of environments. A predictive control model is constructed to describe the dynamic characteristics of the UCAV trajectory planning problem in detail. To improve the UCAV\u2019s predictive ability, we propose a memory-enhanced twin delayed deep deterministic policy gradient (ME-TD3) algorithm that uses an attention mechanism to effectively extract environmental patterns from historical information. The simulation results show that the proposed method can successfully train UCAVs to carry out trajectory planning tasks in dynamic and unknown environments. Furthermore, the ME-TD3 algorithm outperforms other classical DRL algorithms in UCAV trajectory planning, exhibiting superior performance and adaptability.",

With an open and shared wireless medium, a malicious spoofer can impersonate active devices, gain access to the wireless channel, as well as emit or inject signals to mislead IoT nodes and compromise the detection of their location. To address the threat posed by malicious location spoofing attacks, we develop a neural network-based model with single access point (AP) detection capability. In this study, we propose a method for spoofing signal detection and localization by leveraging a feature extraction technique based on a single AP. A neural network model is used to detect the presence of a spoofed unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) and estimate its time of arrival (ToA). We also introduce a centralized approach to data collection and localization. To evaluate the effectiveness of detection and ToA prediction, multi-layer perceptron (MLP) and long short-term memory (LSTM) neural network models are compared.",

These components are interconnected, facilitating the collection and exchange of copious data across networked communications. IoT empowers extensive monitoring and control over a myriad of objects, enabling them to gather and disseminate data that bolster applications, thereby enhancing the system\u2019s capacity for informed decision making, environmental surveillance, and autonomous inter-object interaction, all without the need for direct human involvement. These systems have achieved seamless connectivity requirements using the next-generation wireless network infrastructures (5G, 6G, etc.), while their diverse reliability and quality of service (QoS) requirements across various domains require more efficient solutions. Open RAN (O-RAN), i.e., open radio open access network (RAN), promotes flexibility and intelligence in the next-generation RAN. This article reviews the applications of O-RAN in supporting the next-generation smart world IoT systems by conducting a thorough survey. We propose a generic problem space, which consists of (i) IoT Systems: transportation, industry, healthcare, and energy; (ii) targets: reliable communication, real-time analytics, fault tolerance, interoperability, and integration; and (iii) artificial intelligence and machine learning (AI/ML): reinforcement learning (RL), deep neural networks (DNNs), etc. Furthermore, we outline future research directions concerning robust and scalable solutions, interoperability and standardization, privacy, and security. We present a taxonomy to unveil the security threats to emerge from the O-RAN-assisted IoT systems and the feasible directions to move this research forward.",

      "abstract": "LiDAR-based Multi-Object Tracking (MOT) is a critical technology employed in various autonomous systems, including self-driving vehicles and autonomous delivery robots. In this paper, a novel LiDAR-based 3D MOT approach is introduced. The proposed method was built upon the Tracking-by-Detection (TbD) paradigm and incorporated multi-level associations that exploit an object\u2019s short-term and long-term relationships with the existing tracks. Specifically, the short-term association leverages the fact that objects do not move much between consecutive frames. In contrast, the long-term association assesses the degree to which a long-term trajectory aligns with current detections. The evaluation of the matching between the current detection and the maintained trajectory was performed using a Graph Convolutional Network (GCN). Furthermore, an inactive track was maintained to address the issue of incorrect ID switching for objects that have been occluded for an extended period. The proposed method was evaluated on the KITTI benchmark MOT tracking dataset and achieved a Higher-Order Tracking Accuracy (HOTA) of 75.65%, marking a 5.66% improvement over the benchmark method AB3DMOT, while also accomplishing the number of ID switches of 39, 74 less than AB3DMOT. These results confirmed the effectiveness of the proposed approach in diverse road environments.",

      "abstract": "In recent years, frequent forest fires have seriously threatened the earth\u2019s ecosystem and people\u2019s lives and safety. With the development of machine vision and unmanned aerial vehicle (UAVs) technology, UAV monitoring combined with machine vision has become an important development trend in forest fire monitoring. In the early stages, fire shows the characteristics of a small fire target and obvious smoke. However, the presence of fog interference in the forest will reduce the accuracy of fire point location and smoke identification. Therefore, an anchor-free target detection algorithm called FuF-Det based on an encoder\u2013decoder structure is proposed to accurately detect early fire points obscured by fog. The residual efficient channel attention block (RECAB) is designed as a decoder unit to improve the problem of the loss of fire point characteristics under fog caused by upsampling. Moreover, the attention-based adaptive fusion residual module (AAFRM) is used to self-enhance the encoder features, so that the features retain more fire point location information. Finally, coordinate attention (CA) is introduced to the detection head to make the image features correspond to the position information, and improve the accuracy of the algorithm to locate the fire point. The experimental results show that compared with eight mainstream target detection algorithms, FuF-Det has higher average precision and recall as an early forest fire detection method in fog and provides a new solution for the application of machine vision to early forest fire detection.",

      "abstract": "Deep Learning has enabled significant progress towards more accurate predictions and is increasingly integrated into our everyday lives in real-world applications; this is true especially for Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) in the field of image analysis. Nevertheless, it has been shown that Deep Learning is vulnerable against well-crafted, small perturbations to the input, i.e., adversarial examples. Defending against such attacks is therefore crucial to ensure the proper functioning of these models\u2014especially when autonomous decisions are taken in safety-critical applications, such as autonomous vehicles. In this work, shallow machine learning models, such as Logistic Regression and Support Vector Machine, are utilised as surrogates of a CNN based on the assumption that they would be differently affected by the minute modifications crafted for CNNs. We develop three detection strategies for adversarial examples by analysing differences in the prediction of the surrogate and the CNN model: namely, deviation in (i) the prediction, (ii) the distance of the predictions, and (iii) the confidence of the predictions. We consider three different feature spaces: raw images, extracted features, and the activations of the CNN model. Our evaluation shows that our methods achieve state-of-the-art performance compared to other approaches, such as Feature Squeezing, MagNet, PixelDefend, and Subset Scanning, on the MNIST, Fashion-MNIST, and CIFAR-10 datasets while being robust in the sense that they do not entirely fail against selected single attacks. Further, we evaluate our defence against an adaptive attacker in a grey-box setting.",

      "abstract": "Perception algorithms for autonomous vehicles demand large, labeled datasets. Real-world data acquisition and annotation costs are high, making synthetic data from simulation a cost-effective option. However, training on one source domain and testing on a target domain can cause a domain shift attributed to local structure differences, resulting in a decrease in the model\u2019s performance. We propose a novel domain adaptation approach to address this challenge and to minimize the domain shift between simulated and real-world LiDAR data. Our approach adapts 3D point clouds on the object level by learning the local characteristics of the target domain. A key feature involves downsampling to ensure domain invariance of the input data. The network comprises a state-of-the-art point completion network combined with a discriminator to guide training in an adversarial manner. We quantify the reduction in domain shift by training object detectors with the source, target, and adapted datasets. Our method successfully reduces the sim-to-real domain shift in a distribution-aligned dataset by almost 50%, from 8.63% to 4.36% 3D average precision. It is trained exclusively using target data, making it scalable and applicable to adapt point clouds from any source domain.",

      "abstract": "Vision-based perception modules are increasingly deployed in many applications, especially autonomous vehicles and intelligent robots. These modules are being used to acquire information about the surroundings and identify obstacles. Hence, accurate detection and classification are essential to reach appropriate decisions and take appropriate and safe actions at all times. Current studies have demonstrated that \u201cprinted adversarial attacks\u201d, known as physical adversarial attacks, can successfully mislead perception models such as object detectors and image classifiers. However, most of these physical attacks are based on noticeable and eye-catching patterns for generated perturbations making them identifiable/detectable by the human eye, in-field tests, or in test drives. In this paper, we propose a camera-based inconspicuous adversarial attack (AdvRain) capable of fooling camera-based perception systems over all objects of the same class. Unlike mask-based FakeWeather attacks that require access to the underlying computing hardware or image memory, our attack is based on emulating the effects of a natural weather condition (i.e., Raindrops) that can be printed on a translucent sticker, which is externally placed over the lens of a camera whenever an adversary plans to trigger an attack. Note, such perturbations are still inconspicuous in real-world deployments and their presence goes unnoticed due to their association with a natural phenomenon. To accomplish this, we develop an iterative process based on performing a random search aiming to identify critical positions to make sure that the performed transformation is adversarial for a target classifier. Our transformation is based on blurring predefined parts of the captured image corresponding to the areas covered by the raindrop. We achieve a drop in average model accuracy of more than 45% and 40% on VGG19 for ImageNet dataset and Resnet34 for Caltech-101 dataset, respectively, using only 20 raindrops.",

The six degrees of freedom manoeuvring performance is evaluated by the calculation of surge, sway and heave forces and roll, pitch and yaw moments at Reynolds number 3.7 \u00c3\u0097 106. The numerical model is validated using experimental results for DARPA SUBOFF model. The sea bass sectional geometry has an inherent asymmetry about the horizontal plane, and this is observed in the force and moment coefficients. A detailed study for pressure coefficient and skin friction coefficient is presented, both along the length and circumferentially at specified locations for varying angles of attack and drift angles (-15\u00c2\u00b0 to 15\u00c2\u00b0). Due to transverse pressure gradient, cross-flow structures are observed resulting in vortices from the mid-body that grow downstream, the strength depending on the angle of manoeuvre. It is observed that the sea bass-inspired body generates greater roll and pitch moments and heave force as compared to a symmetric tuna-inspired body for drift angles greater than 10\u00c2\u00b0. The differences show the influence of asymmetry in underwater vessel geometry on its stability and performance during horizontal and vertical plane manoeuvres. The study of the hydrodynamic characteristics will aid the design of control surfaces and development of estimation of manoeuvring and propulsion performance for fish-inspired autonomous underwater vessels. \u00c2\u00a9 2023 Elsevier Ltd",

      "abstract": "With the rapid advancement of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) and the Internet of Things (IoTs), UAV-assisted IoTs has become integral in areas such as wildlife monitoring, disaster surveillance, and search and rescue operations. However, recent studies have shown that these systems are vulnerable to adversarial example attacks during data collection and transmission. These attacks subtly alter input data to trick UAV-based deep learning vision systems, significantly compromising the reliability and security of IoTs systems. Consequently, various methods have been developed to identify adversarial examples within model inputs, but they often lack accuracy against complex attacks like C&W and others. Drawing inspiration from model visualization technology, we observed that adversarial perturbations markedly alter the attribution maps of clean examples. This paper introduces a new, effective detection method for UAV vision systems that uses attribution maps created by model visualization techniques. The method differentiates between genuine and adversarial examples by extracting their unique attribution maps and then training a classifier on these maps. Validation experiments on the ImageNet dataset showed that our method achieves an average detection accuracy of 99.58%, surpassing the state-of-the-art methods.",

The ration of people with diabetes started to increase from 285 million in 2010 and will reach up to 439 million in the year of 2030.Out of the total number of people with Diabetic Retinopathy, approximately one-fourth of the people have vision-threatening disease. Earlier detection and classificationof Diabetic Retinopathy has to be taken much care in order to sustain a patient's vision. The diabetic Retinopathy may be classified into various stages like Mild non-proliferative retinopathy, Moderate nonproliferative retinopathy, severe nonproliferative Retinopathy and Proliferative diabetic retinopathy. Theproblem associated with the manual detection of diabetic retinopathy is that the processing time is high, effortconsumingandrequiresanophthalmologist to examine the eye retinal fund us images. The manual analysis includes Visual Acuity testing, Tonometry and Pupil dilation. The vision lost due to Diabetic retinopathy is sometimes irreparable. Hence there is a need for earlier detection and treatment to reduce the risk of blindness.Hence there are various automated methods of diabetic retinopathy screening that have made good progress using image classification, pattern recognition, and machine learning. The input to the automated image classification model can be the color fundus photography or optical Coherence tomography images. \u00c2\u00a9 2023 The Authors",

      "abstract": "4D millimeter wave (mmWave) imaging radar is a new type of vehicle sensor technology that is critical to autonomous driving systems due to its lower cost and robustness in complex weather. However, the sparseness and noise of point clouds are still the main problems restricting the practical application of 4D imaging radar. In this paper, we introduce SMIFormer, a multi-view feature fusion network framework based on 4D radar single-modal input. SMIFormer decouples the 3D point cloud scene into 3 independent but interrelated perspectives, including bird\u2019s-eye view (BEV), front view (FV), and side view (SV), thereby better modeling the entire 3D scene and overcoming the shortcomings of insufficient feature representation capabilities under single-view built from extremely sparse point clouds. For multi-view features, we proposed multi-view feature interaction (MVI) to exploit the inner relationship between different views by integrating features from intra-view interaction and cross-view interaction. We evaluated the proposed SMIFormer on the View-of-Delft (VoD) dataset. The mAP of our method reached 48.77 and 71.13 in the fully annotated area and the driving corridor area, respectively. This shows that 4D radar has great development potential in the field of 3D object detection.",

      "abstract": "The increasing usage of autonomous and automatic systems within the automotive industry is steering us towards a more interconnected world. This enhanced interconnectivity fosters a more streamlined driving experience, reduces costs, and provides timely driver assistance. The electric/electronic (EE) architectures of modern vehicles are inherently complex due to the multitude of components they encompass. Contemporary architectures reveal that these components converge at an electronic control unit (ECU) called the central gateway, which could potentially represent a single point of failure. While this central unit is typically adequately safeguarded, the same cannot be said for the connected components, which often remain vulnerable to cyber threats. The ISO/SAE 21434 standard paved the way for automotive cybersecurity and could be used in parallel with other standards such as ISO 26262 and ISO PAS 21488. Automatic collision notification (ACN) is one of the most typical systems in a vehicle, and limited effort has been dedicated to identifying the most suitable architecture for this feature. This paper addresses the existing security and privacy gap of this feature by conducting a comparative analysis of security threats in two distinct ACN architectures. Notably, despite ACN architectures exhibiting inherent similarities, the primary distinction between the two architectures lies in their strategies for crash estimation and detection, followed by subsequent communication with emergency response teams. A rigorous security assessment was conducted using the ISO/SAE 21434 standard, employing the TARA and STRIDE methodologies through the Ansys medini analyze software. This analysis identified an average of 310 threats per architecture, including a significant number of high-level threats (11.8% and 15%, respectively), highlighting the importance of a comprehensive evaluation.",

      "abstract": "The steep slopes on both sides of the hydropower station in the southwestern mountainous region develop a multitude of dangerous rock formations. The rolling, collapsing and falling of these hazardous rocks have profound implications on the normal operation of the dam, main buildings, factories, roadways, and slope support systems. At present, the prediction and protection measures against rockfall disasters are predominantly reply on the two-dimensional Rockfall method, which ignores the spatial geometry of these dangerous rocks. In reality, falling rockfalls exhibit three-dimensional motion, and their threat zone extends throughout a three-dimensional geographical space. In view of this, this study is based on the hazard assessment results of the hidden danger investigation in a specific hydropower station of Yunnan Province. It employs field investigations, airborne LiDAR remote sensing measurement technology, and unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) oblique photography technology to obtain high-precision laser radar point cloud data for the study area. This data is used to constrct detailed rock mass models and authentic three-dimensional scene models. The analysis includes historical rockfall distribution characteristics, rock mass structural characteristics, characteristics of hazardous rock masses in collapse source areas, and unstable modes. Furthermore, the study utilizes Unity3D three-dimensional rockfall analysis methods to simulate the motion characteristics of dangerous falling rocks after collapse. This enables the determination of the trajectory of dangerous falling rocks, as well as parameters such as bounce height, impact energy, and rolling area at different locations. The results indicate that for the right bank dangerous rock area of the hydropower station, a typical dangerous rock mass can achieve a maximum bounce height of up to 7.92 meters, with an impact range of approximately 145 meters. Most of these rocks roll towards the dam, which has multiple levels of passive protection nets and does not pose a threat to important facilities within the power plant. In the case of the right bank dangerous rock area two, after the collapse of dangerous rocks masses, the impact range of the falling rocks is approximately 120 meters, and some of the falling rocks may roll along the road embankment onto the road, potentially posing a threat to the main traffic artery. On the left bank, dangerous rock area one has a massive and unstable typical rock mass, with a maximum bounce height of up to 9.02 meters, ultimately falling into the reservoir storage area. Hazardous rock area two on the left bank has a dense distribution of hazardous rock masses, with a significant quantity, and after collapse, the impact range is approximately 380 meters. However, due to the dense vegetation cover on the slope, most of the falling rocks accumulate on the slope surface, posing a certain threat to pedestrians and vehicles. The related research results can provide valuable insights for the identification of hazardous rock masses and simulation of rockfall events in similar hydropower facilities. \u00c2\u00a9 2023 Chinese Medical Journals Publishing House Co.Ltd.

      "abstract": "Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) will be essential to support mission-critical applications of Ultra Reliable Low Latency Communication (URLLC) in futuristic Sixth-Generation (6G) networks. However, several security vulnerabilities and attacks have plagued previous generations of communication systems; thus, physical layer security, especially against eavesdroppers, is vital, especially for upcoming 6G networks. In this regard, UAVs have appeared as a winning candidate to mitigate security risks. In this paper, we leverage UAVs to propose two methods. The first method utilizes a UAV as Decode-and-Forward (DF) relay, whereas the second method utilizes a UAV as a jammer to mitigate eavesdropping attacks for URLLC between transmitter and receiver devices. Moreover, we present a low-complexity algorithm that outlines the two aforementioned methods of mitigating interception, i.e. increasing secrecy rate, and we compare them with the benchmark null method in which there is a direct communication link between transmitter and receiver without the UAV DF relay. Additionally, simulation results show the effectiveness of such methods by improving the secrecy rate and its dependency on UAV height, blocklength, decoding error probability and transmitter-receiver separation distance. Lastly, we recommend the best method to enhance the secrecy rate in the presence of an eavesdropper based on our simulations. \u00c2\u00a9 2022 Chongqing University of Posts and Telecommunications",

      "abstract": "The flow field of a low Reynolds number regime is three-dimensional and exceedingly complicated due to numerous forms of vortical phenomena, which has triggered the interest of many researchers. This study aims to investigate the influence of various trailing edge configurations on the aerodynamic characteristics and flow structure of airfoils. Specifically, five different configurations, namely baseline, serration, comb, and comb-serration are analyzed in detail. The study seeks to identify the configuration that provides optimal aerodynamic performance, which can then inform the design of more efficient airfoils for a range of applications, including unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV), wind energy, and automotive design. A Large-eddy simulation numerical model was developed to effectively evaluate unsteady pressure fluctuations and turbulence parameters at the source. The pressure coefficient and skin friction coefficient figures reveal that modifications result in an early negative pressure zone and uneven flow along the airfoil surfaces. This study presents numerical findings on the NACA0015 airfoil at a zero angle of attack. The pressure coefficient distribution along the airfoil surface exhibits a symmetrical pattern, with the highest pressure observed at the leading edge due to flow deceleration. Analysis of the skin friction coefficient confirms the absence of separation zones on the airfoil surface, except for the tip of the trailing edge. The velocity profile demonstrates a consistent and smooth flow, indicating stable and symmetrical conditions across the airfoil. Moreover, the velocity profiles of the baseline airfoil at zero angle of attack do not indicate any signs of flow separation. Notably, the serrated, combed and comb-serrated trailing edge configurations each yield distinctive effects on fluid flow. The serrated trailing edge promotes increased fluid velocity and pressure drop, while the combed configuration induces separation at the root. Meanwhile, the comb-serrated design sustains a continuous fluid flow over the airfoil surface. Overall, these results contribute to a comprehensive understanding of the aerodynamic behavior and flow characteristics influenced by various trailing edge configurations.",

      "abstract": "Accurate building extraction holds paramount importance in various applications such as urbanization rate calculations, urban planning, and resource allocation. In response to the escalating demand for precise low-altitude unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) building segmentation in intricate scenarios, this study introduces a semi-supervised methodology to alleviate the labor-intensive process of procuring pixel-level annotations. Within the framework of adversarial networks, we employ a dual-channel parallel generator strategy that amalgamates the morphology-driven optical flow estimation channel with an enhanced multilayer sensing Deeplabv3+ module. This approach aims to comprehensively capture both the morphological attributes and textural intricacies of buildings while mitigating the dependency on annotated data. To further enhance the network\u2019s capability to discern building features, we introduce an adaptive attention mechanism via a feature fusion module. Additionally, we implement a composite loss function to augment the model\u2019s sensitivity to building structures. Across two distinct low-altitude UAV datasets within the domain of UAV-based building segmentation, our proposed method achieves average mean pixel intersection-over-union (mIoU) ratios of 82.69% and 79.37%, respectively, with unlabeled data constituting 70% of the overall dataset. These outcomes signify noteworthy advancements compared with contemporaneous networks, underscoring the robustness of our approach in tackling intricate building segmentation challenges in the domain of UAV-based architectural analysis.",

The simulation results show that the improved VO average path is decreased by 39.88% and the average time is cut by 44.26%.

      "abstract": "Autonomous vehicle (AV) technology for self-driving has emerged as a promising solution to alleviate traffic congestion, reduce accidents, and optimize road capacity and fuel consumption. However, these sensors are vulnerable, making AVs susceptible to cyber threats. Consequently, security becomes an indispensable and integral facet of AV architecture. One such challenge is establishing a secure session key between the sensor device and other entities to ensure secure and authorized communication. While some existing schemes support pre-quantum era secure session key establishment within AV systems, post-quantum security's a discernible gap. This paper introduces an innovative quantum secure and highly efficient authentication and key agreement (AKA) scheme. We propose a cloud-centric three-factor authentication and key agreement system based on Ring Learning With Errors (RLWE) to provide robust authentication for both cloud and AVs. Furthermore, we have devised two distinct session keys within our authentication mechanism: one for secure remote control between users and AVs, and the other for ensuring enhanced privacy when accessing cloud-stored data via the cloud server. The efficacy of our proposed design is substantiated through a comprehensive comparative study that includes performance evaluation. Our proposed scheme has better efficiency than existing schemes and is suitable for the post-quantum era. \u00c2\u00a9 2023 Elsevier Inc.",

In each iteration, the property prediction models that guided exploration learned the structure-property space of diverse scaffold derivatives, which were realized with multistep syntheses and a variety of reactions.

      "abstract": "In order to ensure the safety of connected and automated vehicles (CAVs) threatened by cyberattack in the confluence area and mitigate the adverse impact of cyberattack propagation, a framework is built to depict the impact of cyberattacks on traffic operation. Based on this framework, corresponding propagation suppression strategies are proposed for different types of cyberattacks in different periods. Under centralized control, game theory is used to solve the confluence sequence corresponding to the strategies. The results show that the proposed method can effectively inhibit the spread of cyberattacks on the premise of security. The initial control effect is the best. Compared with uncontrolled condition, in the 100 timesteps, 11 susceptible vehicles are finally added, and the second is the immunity period, in which 10 susceptible vehicles were protected from cyberattack. Outbreak and latency control strategies also protect some vehicles. Under the control strategy of each stage, the peak value of infected vehicles and the duration of cyberattack are improved compared with the uncontrolled strategy. In addition, the traffic efficiency in the confluence area is also improved. This method can also be extended to such road types as diverging section, weaving section and intersection, so as to reduce the impact of cyberattacks on road network scale. \u00c2\u00a9 2023 Periodical Offices of Chang\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u0082\u00ac\u00e2\u0084\u00a2an University",

      "abstract": "Audio-based analysis of bird songs has proven to be a valuable practice for the growth of knowledge in the fields of ethology and ecology. In recent years, machine learning techniques applied to audio field recordings of bird calls have yielded successful results in studying population distributions and identification of individuals for their monitoring in a variety of bird species. This offers promising possibilities in the study of social behavior, biodiversity, and conservation strategies for birds. In this work, we trained deep learning models, directly from the sonograms of audio field recordings, to investigate the statistical properties of vocalizations in an endangered bird species, the Yellow Cardinal, Gubernatrix cristata. This research marks the first successful application of this method to an endangered species. Our results indicate the presence of vocal signatures that reflect similarities in songs of individuals that inhabit the same region, determining dialects, but which also show differences between individuals. These differences can be exploited by a deep learning classifier to discriminate the bird identities through their songs. Models trained with data labeled by regions showed a good performance in the recognition of dialects with a mean accuracy of 0.84 \u00c2\u00b1 0.04, significantly higher than the accuracy obtained by chance. Precision and recall values also reflected the classifier's ability to find alike vocal patterns in the songs of neighboring individuals. Models trained with data labeled by individuals showed an accuracy of 0.63 \u00c2\u00b1 0.03, significantly higher than that obtained by chance. However, the individual discrimination model showed greater confusion with neighboring individuals. This reflects a hierarchical structure in the characteristics of the Yellow Cardinal's vocalization, where the intra-individual variability is lower than the inter-individual variability, but it is even lower than the variability obtained when individuals inhabit different regions, providing evidence of the existence of dialects. This reinforces the results of previous works but also offers an automated method for characterizing cultural units within the species. Along with genetic data, this method could help better define management units, thereby benefiting the success of reintroduction of individuals of Yellow Cardinal recovered from the illegal trade. Moreover, the novelty of individual discrimination using neural networks for the Yellow Cardinal, which has limited data availability, shows promise for non-invasive acoustic monitoring strategies with potentially relevant implications for its conservation. \u00c2\u00a9 2023 Elsevier B.V.",

      "abstract": "Hematocrit and hemoglobin levels are common blood tests used to assess the overall health status of patients as well as the oxygen-carrying capacity of the blood. The gold-standard technologies to determine the hematocrit and hemoglobin levels are precise and fast, but they are not pragmatic in extreme point-of-care settings due to the prohibitive cost, process complexity, and sophisticated facilities. Therefore, here, we report the development of a microfluidic paper-based analytical device to determine hematocrit and hemoglobin levels simultaneously. This device exploits the area of the stain formed by a spreading drop of 20 \u00ce\u00bcl of whole blood on Whatman filter paper immobilized with sodium chloride and ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid for hematocrit level, whereas for hemoglobin concentration, it utilizes the gray color intensity of a 20 \u00ce\u00bcl droplet of a mixture of blood and de-ionized water. The performance of the device is verified by comparing with gold-standard results of the automated hematology analyzer, showing a high degree of correlation (R2) of 0.9651 and 0.9701 for hematocrit and hemoglobin levels, respectively. The bias and standard deviation of the differences between the two measurements for hematocrit determination are 0.002 and 1.005, respectively, while the bias and standard deviation of differences between the two methods for hemoglobin determination are 0.065 and 0.398, respectively. This device is likely to provide a simple, fast, disposable, and inexpensive tool to determine the hematocrit and hemoglobin levels in resource-constraint settings. \u00c2\u00a9 2023 Author(s).",

      "abstract": "To improve autonomous cars, the dynamic systems method is re-enacted. Due to the unreality of the sensors employed in vehicles, human creation of the surrounding environment and objects is necessitated. We propose a novel efficient method for generating accurate scenario sensor data using limited LIDAR and video data from an autonomous vehicle. A new SurfelGAN network recreates realistic camera pictures to recognise the cars and moving objects in the scenario. The suggested approach uses real-world camera image data from Waymo Open Dataset to evaluate actual scenarios for autonomous vehicle movement. A new dataset allows for simultaneous analysis of two autonomous cars. This dataset is used to test and explain the proposed SurfelGAN model. GAN is the greatest technique for capturing realistic pictures. The machine generates precise sensor data that is used to identify obstacles, cars, and other moving objects in the route of an autonomous vehicle. The autonomous car approaches the destination by recreating a surfel scene. Pictures are collected using semantic and instance segmentation masks.

      "abstract": "Wildlife monitoring in tropical rainforests poses additional challenges due to species often being elusive, cryptic, faintly colored, and preferring concealable, or difficult to access habitats. Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) prove promising for wildlife surveys in different ecosystems in tropical forests and can be crucial in conserving inaccessible biodiverse areas and their associated species. Traditional surveys that involve infiltrating animal habitats could adversely affect the habits and behavior of elusive and cryptic species in response to human presence. Moreover, collecting data through traditional surveys to simultaneously estimate the abundance and demographic rates of communities of species is often prohibitively time-intensive and expensive. This study assesses the scope of drones to non-invasively access the Bukit Tigapuluh Landscape (BTL) in Riau-Jambi, Indonesia, and detect individual elephants of interest. A rotary-wing quadcopter with a vision-based sensor was tested to estimate the elephant population size and age structure. We developed hierarchical modeling and deep learning CNN to estimate elephant abundance and age structure. Drones successfully observed 96 distinct individuals at 8 locations out of 11 sampling areas. We obtained an estimate of the elephant population of 151 individuals (95% CI [124, 179]) within the study area and predicted more adult animals than subadults and juvenile individuals in the population. Our calculations may serve as a vital spark for innovation for future UAV survey designs in large areas with complex topographies while reducing operational effort.",

An excellent scheme is proposed for the patient\u00e2\u0080\u0099s device, such as a mobile phone or a smartwatch, which can classify the signal coming from a biometric sensor into two types, normal and abnormal. In an abnormal signal, the device can carry out appropriate activities for the patient without requiring a doctor as a first case. The patient does not respond to the warning message in a critical case sometimes, and the personal device sends an alert to the patient\u00e2\u0080\u0099s family, including his/her location. The proposed scheme can preserve the privacy of the sensitive data of the patient in a protected way and can support several security features such as mutual authentication, key management, anonymous password, and resistance to malicious attacks. These features have been proven depending on the Automated Validation of Internet Security Protocols and Applications. Moreover, the computation and communication costs are efficient compared with other related schemes. \u00c2\u00a9 2023 The Authors.",

      "abstract": "(1) Background: health care workers, particularly nurses, have been regularly assaulted during the COVID-19 pandemic. Purpose: to evaluate the prevalence and location of assaults against nursing personnel in Latin America, and to determine predictor factors for aggression against nurses. (2) Methods: A cross-sectional online survey was answered by 374 nurses working in health care during the COVID-19 pandemic. The aggression against nurses was estimated using the Victimization Scale. (3) Results: A total of 288 nurses were included in this study. The victimization scale showed that 52.1% of nurses have suffered aggression by the general population during the COVID-19 pandemic. Males were more likely to be attacked than females (p < 0.05). Additionally, males were attacked more frequently on public transport (x2 = 6.72, p = 0.01). The home neighborhood and markets were other locations with a higher risk of being assaulted (OR: 3.39, CI: 1.53\u20137.50). (4) Conclusions: Our results indicate that nurses in Latin America who work during the COVID-19 pandemic and social isolation have been frequently assaulted by the general public. Males are more frequently attacked than females and the main places of aggression are public transportation, their home neighborhood and supermarkets. Implications for nursing practice: it is necessary to create and implement protocols and guidelines to support nursing personnel during the COVID-19 pandemic. This study was retrospectively registered at the Juarez Autonomous University of Tabasco (103/CIPDACS/2020) on the (08/2020).",

      "abstract": "This paper introduces a resilience assessment methodology for sustainable autonomous maritime transport networks developed by the European project entitled \u00e2\u0080\u009cAdvanced, Efficient, and Green Intermodal Systems\u00e2\u0080\u009d (AEGIS). This problem being addressed in this paper concerns the investigation of threats, incidents, and risks in an autonomous- and sustainable shipping context, and the research question is the development of both preventive measures and reactive actions to maintain an acceptable level of operational constraints. The paper's methodology aids in designing sustainable logistics systems for highly automated waterborne transport, identifying threats and barriers to mitigate event consequences, thereby facilitating a seamless green transition. To examine the usability, this methodology is applied in a case study for cargo transportation, where we in this paper consider the maritime corridor between Trondheim and Rotterdam. The findings encompass the spectrum of possible actions to prevent and mitigate unwanted events and enhance resilience and flexibility. This can be used as a tool to respond to unwanted threats, enhance safety, and introduce new strategies. These results are deemed important as resilience is one of the prerequisites for the development of a sustainable transport system. This is true both for the companies that are engaged in the operation of such systems and for policymakers. \u00c2\u00a9 2023 The Author(s)",

      "abstract": "Deep learning networks have demonstrated outstanding performance in 2D and 3D vision tasks. However, recent research demonstrated that these networks result in failures when imperceptible perturbations are added to the input known as adversarial attacks. This phenomenon has recently received increased interest in the field of autonomous vehicles and has been extensively researched on 2D image-based perception tasks and 3D object detection. However, the adversarial robustness of 3D LiDAR semantic segmentation in autonomous vehicles is a relatively unexplored topic. This study expands the adversarial examples to LiDAR-based 3D semantic segmentation. We developed and analyzed three LiDAR point-based adversarial attack methods on different networks developed on the SemanticKITTI dataset. The findings illustrate that the Cylinder3D network has the highest adversarial susceptibility to the analyzed attacks. We investigated how the class-wise point distribution influences the adversarial robustness of each class in the SemanticKITTI dataset and discovered that ground-level points are extremely vulnerable to point perturbation attacks. Further, the transferability of each attack strategy was assessed, and we found that networks relying on point data representation demonstrate a notable level of resistance. Our findings will enable future research in developing more complex and specific adversarial attacks against LiDAR segmentation and countermeasures against adversarial attacks.",

      "abstract": "With the increasingly maturing technology of unmanned surface vehicles (USVs), their applications are becoming more and more widespread. In order to meet operational requirements in complex scenarios, the real-time interaction and linkage of a large amount of information is required between USVs, between USVs and mother ships, and between USVs and shore-based monitoring systems. Visual images are the main perceptual information gathered from USVs, and their efficient transmission and recognition directly affect the real-time performance of information exchange. However, poor maritime communication signals, strong channel interference, and low bandwidth pose great challenges to efficient image transmission. Traditional image transmission methods have difficulty meeting the real-time and image quality requirements of visual image transmissions from USVs. Therefore, this paper proposes an efficient method for visual image transmission from USVs based on semantic communication. A self-encoder network for semantic encoding which compresses the image into low-dimensional latent semantics through the encoding end, thereby preserving semantic information while greatly reducing the amount of data transmitted, is designed. On the other hand, a generative adversarial network is designed for semantic decoding. The decoding end decodes and reconstructs high-quality images from the semantic information transmitted through the channel, thereby improving the efficiency of image transmission. The experimental results show that the performance of the algorithm is significantly superior to traditional image transmission methods, achieving the best image quality while transmitting the minimum amount of data. Compared with the typical BPG algorithm, when the compression ratio of the proposed algorithm is 51.6% of that of the BPG algorithm, the PSNR and SSIM values are 7.6% and 5.7% higher than the BPG algorithm, respectively. And the average total time of the proposed algorithm is only 59.4% of that of the BPG algorithm.",

      "abstract": "Drones, also known as unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) and sometimes referred to as \u2018Mobile IoT\u2019 or \u2018Flying IoT\u2019, are widely adopted worldwide, with their market share continuously increasing. While drones are generally harnessed for a wide range of positive applications, recent instances of drones being employed as lethal weapons in conflicts between countries like Russia, Ukraine, Israel, Palestine, and Hamas have demonstrated the potential consequences of their misuse. Such misuse poses a significant threat to cybersecurity and human lives, thereby highlighting the need for research to swiftly and accurately analyze drone-related crimes, identify the responsible pilot, and establish when and what illegal actions were carried out. In contrast to existing research, involving limited data collection and analysis of the drone, our study focused on collecting and rigorously analyzing data without restrictions from the remote controller used to operate the drone. This comprehensive approach allowed us to unveil essential details, including the pilot\u2019s account information, the specific drone used, pairing timestamps, the pilot\u2019s operational location, the drone\u2019s flight path, and the content captured during flights. We developed methodologies and proposed artifacts to reveal these specifics, which were supported by real-world data. Significantly, this study is the pioneering digital forensic investigation of remote controller devices. We meticulously collected and analyzed all internal data, and we even employed reverse engineering to decrypt critical information files. These achievements hold substantial significance. The outcomes of this research are expected to serve as a digital forensic methodology for drone systems, thereby making valuable contributions to numerous investigations.",

      "abstract": "With the remarkable advances of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) and machine vision, aerial tracking has attracted wide attention from scholars. Previous tracking methods were mostly implemented in clean and well-lit environments, making it challenging to track camouflaged people rapidly and accurately in woodlands. We develop a framework for camouflaged people aerial tracking (CPAT) based on transformer. Specifically, a camouflaged people discovery strategy is proposed to rapidly generate training samples from the unlabeled videos captured by the UAV. Dynamic programming is also employed to filter noises to generate smooth candidate frames. To exploit multilevel feature information, a transformer fusion framework is designed to integrate shallow spatial information and in-depth semantic features. For reducing computing consumption, the spatial attention reduction mechanism is embedded in the multihead attention for fast tracking. Further, we build a dataset for evaluating the effect of camouflaged people tracking called Cam235, which consists of 85 manually labeled test sequences and more than 100k frames of the unlabeled training set. Exhaustive experiments on Cam235-test and popular tracking datasets prove that the CPAT is superior to other trackers for practical application. Under the most challenging condition of camouflaged people tracking, the CPAT achieves the precision of 67.9%, surpassing the state-of-the-art trackers by large margins.",

      "abstract": "Energy-awareness in the industrial sectors has become a global consensus in recent decades. Green scheduling is acknowledged as an effective weapon to reduce energy consumption in the industrial sectors. Therefore, this paper is devoted to the green scheduling of flexible manufacturing cells (FMC) with auto-guided vehicle transportation, where conflict-free routing of the vehicles is considered. To deal with this problem, a bi-objective optimization model is proposed to achieve the minimization of the maximum completion time and the total energy consumption in an FMC. The studied problem is an extension of flexible job shop problem which is NP-hard. Thus, an improved bi-objective salp swarm algorithm based on decomposition (IMOSSA/D) is proposed and applied to the problem. The approach is based on the decomposition of the bi-objective problem. Salp swarm intelligence along with three stochastic-distribution-based operators are incorporated into the approach, to enhance and balance its exploring and exploiting ability. Computational experiments are performed to compare the proposed approach with two state-of-the-art algorithms. This study allows the decision makers to better trade-off between energy savings and production efficiency in flexible manufacturing cellular environment.",

      "abstract": "The use of unoccupied aerial vehicles (UAVs) for vegetation monitoring is widespread in agriculture and forestry but far less so in ecological restoration where it has tremendous unrealized potential. We tested the ability of multispectral data and a derived vegetation index to classify shrub, herbaceous vegetation, and bare soil cover in a rare alluvial floodplain vegetation community in semiarid Southern California, where shrub cover is manipulated in restoration efforts aimed to provide open habitats required by several threatened and endangered species. Three classifiers and three levels of spatial aggregation were compared for their ability to provide accurate shrub cover estimates at a scale commensurate with the needs of conservation managers. We used object-based image analysis (OBIA) and compared maximum likelihood (ML), support vector machine (SVM), and random forest (RF) classifiers applied to high-spatial resolution (0.14 m) data from a four-band Parrot Sequoia+ multispectral sensor. The SVM and RF classifiers yielded similarly high classification accuracy evaluated using the training data (overall accuracy of 96.4% and 97.6%, respectively), much higher than ML (88%). Aggregating shrub cover data to 25 and 50 m resolutions yielded more accurate and well-calibrated cover estimates (mean absolute error 12% and 11%, respectively, for RF) than 10 m aggregation (MAE 19% for RF). Shrub cover estimated using RF and SVM was able to meet the restoration monitoring needs to distinguish the three phases of shrub habitat characterized by their cover (10\u201330%, 30\u201375%, >75%) that differ in habitat quality and restoration prescriptions.",

The basis of the proposed algorithm is to establish constraint and threat models of a heterogeneous UAV cluster to simultaneously minimize range and maximize value gain and survival probability in an MMS under the constraints of task payload, range, and task requirement. On one hand, the objective function for the heterogeneous UAV cluster within an MMS is derived and it is adopted as a metric for assessing the performance of the joint optimization in task assignment and flight path planning. On the other hand, since the formulated joint optimization problem is a multi-objective, non-linear, and non-convex optimization model due to its multiple decision variables and constraints, the roulette wheel selection (RWS) principle and the elite strategy (ES) are introduced in an ant colony optimization (ACO) to solve the complex optimization model. The simulation results indicate that the proposed algorithm is superior and more efficient compared to other approaches.",

      "abstract": " The autonomous vehicles (AVs) are a part of vehicular ad hoc network (VANET) technology which is gaining a lot of researchers' attention for making the vehicle smarter and safer. In VANETs, the vehicles transmit various types of messages, some are important in terms of human lives while others are for infotainment. These messages give various information to the driver so that the driver can take appropriate precautions on the roads. In this work, the main aim was to concentrate on the safety messages that are very important in VANET infrastructure. In VANET the information transmitted are open, hence it is very easy for any attacker to manipulate or change the critical messages. Hence, in this paper, we intend to implement security to these safety messages by encrypting the elliptic curve digital signature algorithm (ECDSA) algorithm which is further optimized by ate pairing. The results have been compared with the traditional ECDSA in terms of throughput. By using the hybrid ECDSA, we increase the strength of ECDSA and still maintain the integrity of ECDSA, making sure that the authenticity of the vehicles and privacy of the messages is maintained within the VANET infrastructure.

      "abstract": "One of the greatest threats posed by progress around the world is cardiovascular diseases (CVD). Each year, CVD accounts for the vast majority of deaths worldwide. The vast majority of people who die from CVD do so suddenly, and their families have no hope of getting them medical help in time. Because of this, there is a pressing need for a real-time, intelligent system that can keep tabs on cardiac patients round the clock. Internet of Things (IoT)-enabled systems are a viable choice for real-time data monitoring. Internet-based smart healthcare has several potential uses, including monitoring physiological data, such as electrocardiograms (ECGs), heart rates (HRs), blood pressures (BPs), and more. IoT-based smart healthcare paradigms present significant issues, not the least of which is selecting the suitable model. This research proposes a heart rate sensor and a sophisticated hybrid classification algorithm as components of an IoT-based electrocardiogram (ECG) monitoring system. The goal of this study is to aid in the development of an automated key for social happiness by creating an intelligent hybrid classification model that can handle the class imbalance problem with more precision. No matter what validation criterion was used (twofold, fivefold, or tenfold cross-validation), the results of the empirical evaluation showed that the proposed hybrid model achieved better outcomes than the additional ingrained classification models in terms of accuracy and efficiency for both classes.",

A multi-agent system that develops cooperative strategies by reinforcement learning does not perform well, mostly because of the sparse reward problem. This study conducts a 3D environment in which robots play the beach volleyball game. This study combines imitation learning (IL) with reinforcement learning (RL) to solve the sparse reward problem. The results show that the proposed approach gets a higher score in the Elo rating system and robots perform better than the conventional RL approach.",

      "abstract": "The increased number of accidents involving UAVs striking people has caused great societal concern. Therefore, it is necessary to study the threat potential and severity of ground collision accidents of UAVs. This study analyzed the head and neck injury risk resulting from the impact of medium-mass UAVs. First, the finite element (FE) model of the M200-Hybrid III 50th dummy was established, in which the M200 itself had been validated against drop tests, and then the M200-Hybrid III 50th model was validated based on the experimental data of the M200 impacting on the dummy head. High consistency between the simulations and the experiments was observed. Second, simulations were conducted to analyze the head and neck injury severity at different impact speeds, angles, and locations of the M200. As the impact speed increases, HIC15 increases exponentially and $${N}_{ij}$$ increases linearly. It is found that the critical speed range causing injury for both vertical and horizontal impacts is 7\u20139&nbsp;m/s. As the impact angle increases, HIC15 varies in the form of the sum of an inverse proportional function and a linear function, and $${N}_{ij}$$ increases in the form of the sum of power and quadratic function. In addition, the battery-first and the top of mainframe impacts lead to the highest probability of head and neck injury among different impact locations, while the landing gear-first is the lowest. Finally, a biomechanical model (THUMS) was incorporated to develop the M200-THUMS model to study the tissue-level injury of the head and neck under different impact conditions. The simulation results show that neck is prone to ligament injury under vertical impact, while the skull is more likely to be fractured under horizontal impact.",

      "abstract": "Out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA) causes a high mortality rate each year, which is a threat to human well-being and health. An automated external defibrillator (AED) is an effective device for heart attack-related diseases and is a panacea to save OHCA. Most relevant literature focuses on the spatial distribution, accessibility, and configuration optimization of AED devices, which all belong to the characteristics of the spatial distribution of AED devices. Still, there is a lack of discussion on related potential influencing factors. In addition, analysis of AED facilities involving multiple city comparisons is less considered. In this study, data on AED facilities in two major cities in China were obtained through the WeChat applet. Then, the AED equity at the city and block scales and its socioeconomic factors were analyzed using the Gini coefficient, Lorenz curve, and optimal parameters-based geo-graphical detector (OPGD) model. Results show that the number of AEDs in Shenzhen was about eight-times that of in Guangzhou. The distribution of AEDs in Shenzhen was more equitable with a global Gini of 0.347, higher than that in Guangzhou with a global Gini of 0.504. As for the determinants of AED equity, residential density was the most significant determinant in both Guangzhou and Shenzhen from the perspective of individual effects on AED equity. Differently, due to the aging population in Guangzhou, the proportion of the elderly in blocks was influential to local AED equity. The local economic development level was crucial to local AED equity in Shenzhen. The results of the interaction detector model illustrate that relatively equitable AED distributions were found in the high-density residential areas with a balance of employment and housing, high-aging residential areas, and high-mobility residential areas in Guangzhou. The area with a high level of local economic development, dense population, and large mobility was the area with a relatively equitable distribution of AEDs in Shenzhen. The results of this paper are conducive to understanding the equity of AEDs and its socio-economic determinants, providing scientific reference for the optimization and management of AEDs.",

      "abstract": "Manual total knee arthroplasty (TKA) has been documented several times for their safety and complications data. In contrast, there is a limited evidence-based analysis for safety and complications of autonomous robotic-assisted (RA)-TKA. This study aimed to evaluate the safety features and intra-operative surgical complications associated with the use of Cuvis Joint\u2122 autonomous robotic system for TKA. The study included 500 consecutive patients who underwent TKA using the Cuvis Joint\u2122 autonomous robotic system from November 2020 to November 2021. All surgeries were performed by a senior surgeon. Patients in whom the surgery was abandoned midway due to technical errors, were excluded from the analysis. In case of unilateral abandonment of the robotic arm during a bilateral RA-TKA, data of the side on which the surgery was completed with robotic assistance was recorded. There was no incidence of neurological injury, vascular injury, extensor mechanism disruption, or medial collateral ligament injury. There was one case of superficial abrasion of the patellar tendon; however, it did not require any intervention. There were no cases of midway abandonment due to threatened soft tissue injury. There was no intra-operative pin loosening or stress-related fractures at the pin sites. There was one case of Steinmann pin breakage and another case of drill bit breakage, which were removed without any damage to the bone. The Cuvis Joint\u2122 autonomous robotic system for TKA is safe with no significant intra-operative complications.",

      "abstract": "The reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS) has been widely recognized as a rising paradigm for physical layer security due to its potential to substantially adjust the electromagnetic propagation environment. In this regard, this paper adopted the RIS deployed on an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) to enhance information transmission while defending against both jamming and eavesdropping attacks. Furthermore, an innovative deep reinforcement learning (DRL) approach is proposed with the purpose of optimizing the power allocation of the base station (BS) and the discrete phase shifts of the RIS. Specifically, considering the imperfect illegitimate node\u2019s channel state information (CSI), we first reformulated the non-convex and non-conventional original problem into a Markov decision process (MDP) framework. Subsequently, a noisy dueling double-deep Q-network with prioritized experience replay (Noisy-D3QN-PER) algorithm was developed with the objective of maximizing the achievable sum rate while ensuring the fulfillment of the security requirements. Finally, the numerical simulations showed that our proposed algorithm outperformed the baselines on the system rate and at transmission protection level.",

      "abstract": "The sweet potato is an essential food and economic crop that is often threatened by the devastating sweet potato virus disease (SPVD), especially in developing countries. Traditional laboratory-based direct detection methods and field scouting are commonly used to rapidly detect SPVD. However, these molecular-based methods are costly and disruptive, while field scouting is subjective, labor-intensive, and time-consuming. In this study, we propose a deep learning-based object detection framework to assess the feasibility of detecting SPVD from ground and aerial high-resolution images. We proposed a novel object detector called SPVDet, as well as a lightweight version called SPVDet-Nano, using a single-level feature. These detectors were prototyped based on a small-scale publicly available benchmark dataset (PASCAL VOC 2012) and compared to mainstream feature pyramid object detectors using a leading large-scale publicly available benchmark dataset (MS COCO 2017). The learned model weights from this dataset were then transferred to fine-tune the detectors and directly analyze our self-made SPVD dataset encompassing one category and 1074 objects, incorporating the slicing aided hyper inference (SAHI) technology. The results showed that SPVDet outperformed both its single-level counterparts and several mainstream feature pyramid detectors. Furthermore, the introduction of SAHI techniques significantly improved the detection accuracy of SPVDet by 14% in terms of mean average precision (mAP) in both ground and aerial images, and yielded the best detection accuracy of 78.1% from close-up perspectives. These findings demonstrate the feasibility of detecting SPVD from ground and unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) high-resolution images using the deep learning-based SPVDet object detector proposed here. They also have great implications for broader applications in high-throughput phenotyping of sweet potatoes under biotic stresses, which could accelerate the screening process for genetic resistance against SPVD in plant breeding and provide timely decision support for production management.",

      "abstract": "Cognitive assessment plays a vital role in clinical care and research fields related to cognitive aging and cognitive health. Lately, researchers have worked towards providing resolutions to measure individual cognitive health; however, it is still difficult to use those resolutions from the real world, and therefore using deep neural networks to evaluate cognitive health is becoming a hot research topic. Deep learning and human activity recognition are two domains that have received attention for the past few years. The former is for its relevance in application fields like health monitoring or ambient assisted living, and the latter is due to their excellent performance and recent achievements in various fields of application, namely, speech and image recognition. This research develops a novel Symbiotic Organism Search with a Deep Convolutional Neural Network-based Human Activity Recognition (SOSDCNN-HAR) model for Cognitive Health Assessment. The goal of the SOSDCNN-HAR model is to recognize human activities in an end-to-end way. For the noise elimination process, the presented SOSDCNN-HAR model involves the Wiener filtering (WF) technique. In addition, the presented SOSDCNN-HAR model follows a RetinaNet-based feature extractor for automated extraction of features. Moreover, the SOS procedure is exploited as a hyperparameter optimizing tool to enhance recognition efficiency. Furthermore, a gated recurrent unit (GRU) prototype can be employed as a categorizer to allot proper class labels. The performance validation of the SOSDCNN-HAR prototype is examined using a set of benchmark datasets. A far-reaching experimental examination reported the betterment of the SOSDCNN-HAR prototype over current approaches with enhanced precision of 86.51% and 89.50% on Penn Action and NW-UCLA datasets, respectively.",

The proposed study aims to show propeller noise features that indicate stall flow regime on the blade. Analysis of the noise characteristics around the propeller in terms of power spectral density allow to detect the stall. The study shows that a microphone located at different angles around the propeller can provide data sufficient to determine if the blade angle of attack has forced the propeller into the stall regime. In this range, the propeller\u2019s efficiency in hover decreases and leads to an increase in power consumption.

      "abstract": "Aiming at the problem of the excessive error of direction of arrival (DOA) estimation caused by the position disturbance of a UAV swarm during flight, a robust polarization-DOA estimation method based on sparse Bayesian learning (SBL) is proposed. First, the algorithm decomposes the covariance matrix of the received data of the UAV swarm vector array and then constructs the determination matrix of the UAV position coordinates by exploiting the orthogonality of the eigenvalues and eigenvectors. Then, the optimal solution of the semi-positive definite programming (SDP) problem is solved using the constrained global least square method, and the exact self-positioning coordinates of UAVs are obtained. Second, we construct a spatially discrete grid to model the received data of the UAV group vector array. The SBL theory is then applied to obtain the posterior probability distribution of the sparse signal matrix. The sparsity of the signal matrix is controlled with a hyperparameter, and the estimation of the DOA is conducted using a fixed-point iteration to obtain the maximum posterior estimate of the signal matrix. Finally, according to the estimated DOA, the polarization parameter is obtained from the constructed objective function of the polarization parameter estimation. The simulation results show that the proposed algorithm achieves higher accuracy and robustness than the traditional 2D DOA estimation algorithm in the direction-finding system for UAV swarm vector arrays.",

      "abstract": "Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) have been increasingly utilized for facility safety inspections due to their superior safety, cost effectiveness, and inspection accuracy compared to traditional manpower-based methods. High-resolution images captured by UAVs directly contribute to identifying and quantifying structural defects on facility exteriors, making image quality a critical factor in achieving accurate results. However, motion blur induced by external factors such as vibration, low light conditions, and wind during UAV operation significantly degrades image quality, leading to inaccurate defect detection and quantification. To address this issue, this research proposes a deblurring network using a Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) to eliminate the motion blur effect in UAV images. The GAN-based motion deblur network represents an image inpainting method that leverages generative models to correct blurry artifacts, thereby generating clear images. Unlike previous studies, this proposed approach incorporates deblur and blur learning modules to realistically generate blur images required for training the generative models. The UAV images processed using the motion deblur network are evaluated using a quality assessment method based on local blur map and other well-known image quality assessment (IQA) metrics. Moreover, in the experiment of crack detection utilizing the object detection system, improved detection results are observed when using enhanced images. Overall, this research contributes to improving the quality and accuracy of facility safety inspections conducted with UAV-based inspections by effectively addressing the challenges associated with motion blur effects in UAV-captured images.",

      "abstract": "An immunoassay is an analytical test method in which analyte quantitation is based on signal responses generated as a consequence of an antibody\u2013antigen interaction. They are the method of choice for the measurement of a large panel of diagnostic markers. Not only are they fully automated, allowing for a short turnaround time and high throughput, but offer high sensitivity and specificity with low limits of detection for a wide range of analytes. Many immunoassay manufacturers exploit the extremely high affinity of biotin for streptavidin in their assay design architectures as a means to immobilize and detect analytes of interest. The biotin\u2013(strept)avidin system is, however, vulnerable to interference with high levels of supplemental biotin that may cause elevated or suppressed test results. Since this system is heavily applied in clinical diagnostics, biotin interference has become a serious concern, prompting the FDA to issue a safety report alerting healthcare workers and the public about the potential harm of ingesting high levels of supplemental biotin contributing toward erroneous diagnostic test results. This review includes a general background and historical prospective of immunoassays with a focus on the biotin\u2013streptavidin system, interferences within the system, and what mitigations are applied to minimize false diagnostic results.",

      "abstract": "The dispersion of chemical gases poses a threat to human health, animals, and the environment. Leaks or accidents during the handling of samples and laboratory materials can result in the uncontrolled release of hazardous or explosive substances. Therefore, it is crucial to monitor gas concentrations in environments where these substances are manipulated. Gas sensor technology has evolved rapidly in recent years, offering increasingly precise and reliable solutions. However, there are still challenges to be overcome, especially when sensors are deployed on unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs). This article discusses the use of UAVs to locate gas sources and presents real test results using the SGP40 metal oxide semiconductor gas sensor onboard the Crazyflie 2.1 nano quadcopter. The solution proposed in this article uses an odor source identification strategy, employing a gas distribution mapping approach in a three-dimensional environment. The aim of the study was to investigate the feasibility and effectiveness of this approach for detecting gases in areas that are difficult to access or dangerous for humans. The results obtained show that the use of drones equipped with gas sensors is a promising alternative for the detection and monitoring of gas leaks in closed environments.",

      "abstract": "Unmanned Surface Vehicles (USVs) are used to monitor territorial waters and collect sea data, including hydrographic and oceanographic data. Compared with larger survey vessels, USVs are more flexible and cost-efficient because of their compact form. The latest USV design uses NACA foil as a trimaran hull form with a self-maneuvering system. This design must provide minimal resistance for longer durability during operation. In this study, the authors investigated the relationship between the distance, angle of attack, and shape of the NACA foil as a USV trimaran hull to reduce the resistance. The analysis began with verification and validation based on previous experimental research. Several configurations of the positions of each hull were modelled using an angle of attack of up to 20 \u00b0. Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) analysis was employed in ANSYS CFX to simulate the model. After obtaining the optimal configuration, variations in the NACA foil on the hull were performed, and the simulation was repeated. The study found that the configuration without an angle of attack, with one hull positioned in front and two hulls positioned behind, using NACA 0024 produces the smallest resistance value. Furthermore, this configuration exhibited wave interference with smaller volume-fraction contours. The study concludes that the angle of attack results in greater resistance owing to the shorter distance between the NACA foils. This research provides insight into the trimaran design of USVs and contributes to the further development of marine robotics technology and unmanned surface vehicles.",

      "abstract": "As technology advances, the use of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) and image sensors for structural monitoring and diagnostics is becoming increasingly critical. This approach enables the efficient inspection and assessment of structural conditions. Furthermore, the integration of deep learning techniques has been proven to be highly effective in detecting damage from structural images, as demonstrated in our study. To enable effective learning by deep learning models, a substantial volume of data is crucial, but collecting appropriate instances of structural damage from real-world scenarios poses challenges and demands specialized knowledge, as well as significant time and resources for labeling. In this study, we propose a methodology that utilizes a generative adversarial network (GAN) for image-to-image translation, with the objective of generating synthetic structural damage data to augment the dataset. Initially, a GAN-based image generation model was trained using paired datasets. When provided with a mask image, this model generated an RGB image based on the annotations. The subsequent step generated domain-specific mask images, a critical task that improved the data augmentation process. These mask images were designed based on prior knowledge to suit the specific characteristics and requirements of the structural damage dataset. These generated masks were then used by the GAN model to produce new RGB image data incorporating various types of damage. In the experimental validation conducted across the three datasets to assess the image generation for data augmentation, our results demonstrated that the generated images closely resembled actual images while effectively conveying information about the newly introduced damage. Furthermore, the experimental validation of damage detection with augmented data entailed a comparative analysis between the performance achieved solely with the original dataset and that attained with the incorporation of additional augmented data. The results for damage detection consistently demonstrated that the utilization of augmented data enhanced performance when compared to relying solely on the original images.",

      "abstract": "Multiple unmanned aerial vehicle (multi-UAV) systems have gained significant attention in applications, such as aerial surveillance and search and rescue missions. With the recent development of state-of-the-art multiagent reinforcement learning (MARL) algorithms, it is possible to train multi-UAV systems in collaborative and competitive environments. However, the inherent vulnerabilities of multiagent systems pose significant privacy and security risks when deploying general and conventional MARL algorithms. The presence of even a single Byzantine adversary within the system can severely degrade the learning performance of UAV agents. This work proposes a Byzantine-resilient MARL algorithm that leverages a combination of geometric median consensus and a robust state update model to mitigate, or even eliminate, the influence of Byzantine attacks. To validate its effectiveness and feasibility, the authors include a multi-UAV threat model, provide a guarantee of robustness, and investigate key attack parameters for multiple UAV navigation scenarios. Results from the experiments show that the average rewards during a Byzantine attack increased by up to 60% for the cooperative navigation scenario compared with conventional MARL techniques. The learning rewards generated by the baseline algorithms could not converge during training under these attacks, while the proposed method effectively converged to an optimal solution, proving its viability and correctness.",

      "abstract": "To identify opportunities and recent advances in the use of multicentric digital data sources and networks to investigate the epidemiology and management of patients with infections admitted to intensive care units (ICUs). Electronic surveillance systems for a range of serious infections have been reported from large cohorts with evident improvements in efficiency, objectivity, and comprehensiveness of coverage as compared to traditional methods. Electronic data, most notably from electronic health records, has been used to define the epidemiology and outcomes of severe infections in several settings and conditions and has facilitated population-based evaluation. Automated alerts and notifications hold promise to identify patients at risk for sepsis and bloodstream infection although demonstration of efficacy in interventional trials is needed. Exploitation of electronic data in ICUs has led to a better understanding of the epidemiology of severe infections and holds promise for future interventional clinical trials.",

      "abstract": "This article presents the design and the implementation of a cloud system for knowledge-based autonomous interaction devised for Social Robots and other conversational agents. The system is particularly convenient for low-cost robots and devices: it can be used as a stand-alone dialogue system or as an integration to provide \u201cbackground\u201d dialogue capabilities to any preexisting natural language understanding ability that the robot may already have as part of its basic skills. By connecting to the cloud, developers are provided with a sustainable solution to manage verbal interaction through a network connection, with about 3000 topics of conversation ready for \u201cchit-chatting\u201d and a library of pre-cooked plans that only needs to be grounded into the robot\u2019s physical capabilities. The system is structured as a set of REST API endpoints so that it can be easily expanded by adding new APIs to improve the capabilities of the clients connected to the cloud. Another key feature of the system is that it has been designed to make the development of its clients straightforward: in this way, multiple robots and devices can be easily endowed with the capability of autonomously interacting with the user, understanding when to perform specific actions, and exploiting all the information provided by cloud services. The article outlines and discusses the results of the experiments performed to assess the system\u2019s performance in terms of response time, paving the way for its use both for research and market solutions. Links to repositories with clients for ROS and popular robots such as Pepper and NAO are provided.",

      "abstract": "Most real-world situations involve unavoidable measurement noises or perception errors which result in unsafe decision making or even casualty in autonomous driving. To address these issues and further improve safety, automated driving is required to be capable of handling perception uncertainties. Here, this paper presents an observation-robust reinforcement learning against observational uncertainties to realize safe decision making for autonomous vehicles. Specifically, an adversarial agent is trained online to generate optimal adversarial attacks on observations, which attempts to amplify the average variation distance on perturbed policies. In addition, an observation-robust actor-critic approach is developed to enable the agent to learn the optimal policies and ensure that the changes of the policies perturbed by optimal adversarial attacks remain within a certain bound. Lastly, the safe decision making scheme is evaluated on a lane change task under complex highway traffic scenarios. The results show that the developed approach can ensure autonomous driving performance, as well as the policy robustness against adversarial attacks on observations.",

      "abstract": "Building facades has always been a challenge for feature matching in oblique photogrammetry due to weak textures, non-Lambertian objects, severe occlusion, and distortion. Plumb lines are essential building geometry structural feature lines in building facades, which show strong spatial relevance to these problems. Achieving plumb line matching has great application potential for optimizing the process and products of oblique photogrammetry. Thus, we proposed a novel matching algorithm for plumb lines based on spatial and color hybrid constraints according to its central projection imaging characteristics. Firstly, based on vanishing point theory, the plumb lines from photos were back-calculated to determine the matching target set; secondly, the property of its large elevation ranges was exploited to calculate the homonymous points as spatial constraints by projecting plumb lines onto the stratified spatial planes; thirdly, the neighboring primary colors on both sides of the plumb lines were extracted as feature descriptors and compared by colorimetry; then, the greedy strategy was employed to successively filter out the locally optimal solutions satisfying the spatial and color hybrid constraints to complete the initial matching; finally, the intersection-over-union analysis of the solution plane and the verticalness evaluation of the matching results were implemented to eliminate errors. The results show that the proposed algorithm can achieve an average accuracy of 97.29% and 78.41% in the forward and lateral overlap experiments from multi-scenes, respectively, displaying a strong adaptability to poor texture, inconsistency, and distortion. In conclusion, thanks to the plumb-line-oriented matching strategy, this algorithm owns inherent advantages in theory and computational complexity. It is suitable for all building-oriented oblique photogrammetry tasks and is highly worthy of promotion and application.",

      "abstract": "Perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA) is a persistent organic contaminant with potential health threats to both animals and humans. However, the impact of PFOA on insects, which play significant roles in ecosystems, is understudied. We evaluated the toxicological impact of ecologically relevant concentrations of PFOA (0, 25, 50, 100, and 200&nbsp;\u00b5g L\u22121) on Nauphoeta cinerea nymphs following exposure for 42 consecutive days. We analyzed the behavior of the insects with automated video-tracking software and processed the head, midgut, and fat body for biochemical assays. PFOA-exposed insects exhibited significant reductions in locomotory abilities and an increase in freezing time. Furthermore, PFOA exposure reduced acetylcholinesterase activity in the insect head. PFOA exposure increased the activities of superoxide dismutase, glutathione peroxidase, and catalase in the head and midgut, but decreased them in the fat body. PFOA also significantly increased glutathione-S transferase activity, while decreasing glutathione levels in the head, midgut, and fat body. Additionally, PFOA exposure increased reactive oxygen and nitrogen species, nitric oxide, lipid peroxidation, and protein carbonyl contents in the head, midgut, and fat body of the insects. In conclusion, our findings indicate that PFOA exposure poses an ecological risk to Nauphoeta cinerea.",

      "abstract": "Video description refers to understanding visual content and transforming that acquired understanding into automatic textual narration. It bridges the key AI fields of computer vision and natural language processing in conjunction with real-time and practical applications. Deep learning-based approaches employed for video description have demonstrated enhanced results compared to conventional approaches. The current literature lacks a thorough interpretation of the recently developed and employed sequence to sequence techniques for video description. This paper fills that gap by focusing mainly on deep learning-enabled approaches to automatic caption generation. Sequence to sequence models follow an Encoder\u2013Decoder architecture employing a specific composition of CNN, RNN, or the variants LSTM or GRU as an encoder and decoder block. This standard-architecture can be fused with an attention mechanism to focus on a specific distinctiveness, achieving high quality results. Reinforcement learning employed within the Encoder\u2013Decoder structure can progressively deliver state-of-the-art captions by following exploration and exploitation strategies. The transformer mechanism is a modern and efficient transductive architecture for robust output. Free from recurrence, and solely based on self-attention, it allows parallelization along with training on a massive amount of data. It can fully utilize the available GPUs for most NLP tasks. Recently, with the emergence of several versions of transformers, long term dependency handling is not an issue anymore for researchers engaged in video processing for summarization and description, or for autonomous-vehicle, surveillance, and instructional purposes. They can get auspicious directions from this research.",

      "abstract": "Object detection is considered as one of the most important applications of deep learning. However, the object detection techniques lose their effectiveness and reliability when they fall victim to adversarial attacks. This big flaw has made it challenging to fully adopt the object detection applications in important products and essential industries such as autonomous vehicles. While the field of adversarial robustness has witnessed a great deal of achievement in building sophisticated methods of attack and defense, the majority of the work has been focused on the task of image classification due to its simplicity in theory and practice. In this paper, we provide an up-to-date survey of recent advancements in the field of adversarial robustness for object detection. We review the prominent attack and defense mechanisms presented in the research community and provide discussions and insights on their strengths and weaknesses. In addition, we review the recent literature on adversarial robustness for applications related to autonomous vehicles, as a critical aspect of this high-impact emerging industry, in which the robustness of models is of vital importance.",

      "abstract": "Agroforestry has an indispensable role in food and livelihood security in addition to its capacity to combat the detrimental effects of climate change. However, agroforestry has not been properly promoted and exploited due to lack of precise extent, geographical distribution, and carbon sequestration (CS) assessment. The recent advent of geospatial technologies, as well as free availability of spatial data and software, can provide new insights into agroforestry resources assessment, decision-making, and policy development despite agroforestry\u2019s small spatial extent, isolated nature, and higher structural and functional complexity of agroforestry. In this review, the existing application of geospatial technologies together with its constraints and limitations as well as the potential future application for agroforestry has been discussed. The review reveals that the application of optical remote sensing in agroforestry includes spatial extent mapping, production of tree species spectral signature, CS assessment, and suitability mapping. Simultaneously, the recent surge in the use of synthetic aperture radar in conjunction with algorithms based on vegetation photosynthesis and optical data enables a more accurate estimation of gross primary productivity at different scales. However, unmanned aerial vehicles equipped with sensors, such as multispectral, LiDAR, hyperspectral, and thermal, offer a considerably higher potential and accuracy than satellite-based datasets. In the future, the health monitoring of agroforestry systems can be a key concern that may be addressed by utilizing hyperspectral and thermal datasets to analyze plant biochemistry, chlorophyll fluorescence, and water stress. Additionally, current (GEDI, ECOSTRESS) and future space agency missions (BIOMASS, FLEX, NISAR, TRISHNA) have enormous potential to shed fresh light on agroforestry systems.",

      "abstract": "The safety and security of the passengers in vehicles in the face of cyber attacks is a key concern in the automotive industry, especially with the emergence of the Advanced driver assistance systems and the vast improvement in autonomous vehicles. Such platforms use various sensors, including cameras, LiDAR and mmWave radar. These sensors themselves may present a potential security hazard if exploited by an attacker. In this paper we propose a system to attack an automotive FMCW mmWave radar, that uses fast chirp modulation. Using a single rogue radar, our attack system is capable of spoofing the distance and velocity measured by the victim vehicle simultaneously, presenting phantom measurements coherent with the laws of physics governing vehicle motion. The attacking radar controls the delay in order to spoof its distance, and uses phase compensation and control in order to spoof its velocity. After developing the attack theory, we demonstrate the spoofing attack by building a proof-of-concept hardware-based system, using a Software Defined Radio. We successfully demonstrate two real-world scenarios in which the victim radar is spoofed to detect either a phantom emergency stop or a phantom acceleration, while measuring coherent range and velocity. We also discuss several countermeasures that can mitigate the described attack.",

      "abstract": "LiDAR point clouds are significantly impacted by snow in driving scenarios, introducing scattered noise points and phantom objects, thereby compromising the perception capabilities of autonomous driving systems. Current effective methods for removing snow from point clouds largely rely on outlier filters, which mechanically eliminate isolated points. This research proposes a novel translation model for LiDAR point clouds, the \u2018L-DIG\u2019 (LiDAR depth images GAN), built upon refined generative adversarial networks (GANs). This model not only has the capacity to reduce snow noise from point clouds, but it also can artificially synthesize snow points onto clear data. The model is trained using depth image representations of point clouds derived from unpaired datasets, complemented by customized loss functions for depth images to ensure scale and structure consistencies. To amplify the efficacy of snow capture, particularly in the region surrounding the ego vehicle, we have developed a pixel-attention discriminator that operates without downsampling convolutional layers. Concurrently, the other discriminator equipped with two-step downsampling convolutional layers has been engineered to effectively handle snow clusters. This dual-discriminator approach ensures robust and comprehensive performance in tackling diverse snow conditions. The proposed model displays a superior ability to capture snow and object features within LiDAR point clouds. A 3D clustering algorithm is employed to adaptively evaluate different levels of snow conditions, including scattered snowfall and snow swirls. Experimental findings demonstrate an evident de-snowing effect, and the ability to synthesize snow effects.",

An indicator of danger is the appearance of gas, which occurs as a result of unauthorized heating of the equipment. Gas sensors make it possible to detect the appearance of gases characteristic for the decomposition of materials at the stage of smouldering and pyrolysis, which cause a change in the composition of the atmosphere. This paper presents a mathematical method for the rational placement of gas analyzers in the premises of potentially hazardous industries. The rational placement of gas sensors ensures safety, taking into account economic feasibility. For the first time, an analysis of the accumulation of gas flow from the source to the ceiling, and then to the location of the sensors, was used to select the location of gas sensors. Depending on the permissible values of the gas volume, the placement and number of gas sensors are selected. The calculation of the conditions for the rational placement of gas sensors is carried out according to the most common indicators, such as carbon monoxide and hydrogen at different sizes and heights of premises.",

      "abstract": "Background: Cluster headache (CH) is a type of headache that has a global prevalence of 0.5\u20133/1000 people, provokes severe, strictly unilateral pain through the first branch of the trigeminal nerve, and is associated with observable autonomous responses. CH provokes intense pain and decreases quality of life. Objective: In this study, we aimed to carry out a systematic review of the effectiveness of non-invasive neuromodulation of the vagus nerve in patients with cluster headaches, which was registered on PROSPERO No. CRD42021265126. Methods: Six databases were used from their date of inception to February 2023 to obtain studies with the group intervention of non-invasive neuromodulation of the vagus nerve for cluster headache, with outcomes based on pain attacks, duration, and disabilities. Data on the subjects, group intervention, main outcomes, and results were collected by two authors. Results: The search provided 1003 articles, with three clinical trials being eligible for inclusion in the review. The methodological quality scores ranged from 6 to 8 points (mean: 7.3, SD: 0.8) out of a maximum of 10 points. The post-treatment results showed some positive effects using n-VNS as a treatment for cluster headache, more specifically regarding cervical neuromodulation of the vagus nerve. Conclusions: The systematic review found moderate-to-high-quality evidence supporting that n-VNS and cervical n-VNS may have some positive effects at the end of the treatment being effective to relieve the frequency and intensity of cluster headaches. The poor quantity of studies available and the lack of homogeneity in the study protocols did not allow the pooling of data for a meta-analysis.",

      "abstract": "Current vehicles include electronic features that provide ease and convenience to drivers. These electronic features or nodes rely on in-vehicle communication protocols to ensure functionality. One of the most-widely adopted in-vehicle protocols on the market today is the Controller Area Network, popularly referred to as the CAN bus. The CAN bus is utilized in various modern, sophisticated vehicles. However, as the sophistication levels of vehicles continue to increase, we now see a high rise in attacks against them. These attacks range from simple to more-complex variants, which could have detrimental effects when carried out successfully. Therefore, there is a need to carry out an assessment of the security vulnerabilities that could be exploited within the CAN bus. In this research, we conducted a security vulnerability analysis on the CAN bus protocol by proposing an attack scenario on a CAN bus simulation that exploits the arbitration feature extensively. This feature determines which message is sent via the bus in the event that two or more nodes attempt to send a message at the same time. It achieves this by prioritizing messages with lower identifiers. Our analysis revealed that an attacker can spoof a message ID to gain high priority, continuously injecting messages with the spoofed ID. As a result, this prevents the transmission of legitimate messages, impacting the vehicle\u2019s operations. We identified significant risks in the CAN protocol, including spoofing, injection, and Denial of Service. Furthermore, we examined the latency of the CAN-enabled system under attack, finding that the compromised node (the attacker\u2019s device) consistently achieved the lowest latency due to message arbitration. This demonstrates the potential for an attacker to take control of the bus, injecting messages without contention, thereby disrupting the normal operations of the vehicle, which could potentially compromise safety.",

      "abstract": "The aim of this article is to propose methods for obtaining the aerodynamic characteristics of a flying object in a turbulent atmosphere. This article presents static aerodynamic characteristics of an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV), which have been obtained during experimental examinations and during numerical calculations. The results have been compared with each other in order to validate the numerical model and methods. The method for modeling gusts using state-of-the-art CFD software (i.e., ANSYS Fluent Release 16.2) has been proposed and applied to obtain the aerodynamic characteristics of a UAV including during gusts. Two cases have been analyzed. In the first case, a downburst was modeled. In the second case, a single oblique gust was modeled (i.e., changing the angle of attack and the angle of sideslip), that had a complicated time course in regard to its velocity. Although this article is focused on the assessment of the vulnerability of a UAV model to gusts, the practical implications of the proposed methodology are applicable to a wide selection of objects, including wind turbines.",

      "abstract": "Accurate segmentation of cardiac anatomy is a prerequisite for the diagnosis of cardiovascular disease. However, due to differences in imaging modalities and imaging devices, known as domain shift, the segmentation performance of deep learning models lacks reliability. In this paper, we propose a two-stage progressive unsupervised domain adaptation network (TSP-UDANet) to reduce domain shift when segmenting cardiac images from various sources. We alleviate the domain shift between the feature distribution of the source and target domains by introducing an intermediate domain as a bridge. The TSP-UDANet consists of three sub-networks: a style transfer sub-network, a segmentation sub-network, and a self-training sub-network. We conduct cooperative alignment of different domains at image level, feature level, and output level. Specifically, we transform the appearance of images across domains and enhance domain invariance by adversarial learning in multiple aspects to achieve unsupervised segmentation of the target modality. We validate the TSP-UDANet on the MMWHS (unpaired MRI and CT images), MS-CMRSeg (cross-modality MRI images), and M&amp;Ms (cross-vendor MRI images) datasets. The experimental results demonstrate excellent segmentation performance and generalizability for unlabeled target modality images.",

      "abstract": "\nDyna is a planning paradigm that naturally weaves learning and planning together through environmental models. Dyna-style reinforcement learning improves the sample efficiency using the simulation experience generated by the environment model to update the value function. However, the existing Dyna-style planning methods are usually based on tabular methods, only suitable for tasks with low-dimensional and small-scale space. In addition, the quality of the simulation experience generated by the existing methods cannot be guaranteed, which significantly limits its application in tasks such as continuous control of high-dimensional robots and autonomous driving. To this end, we propose a model-based approach that controls planning through a validator. The validator filters high-quality experiences for policy learning and decides whether to stop planning. To deal with the exploration and exploitation dilemma in reinforcement learning, a combination of \u03f5-greedy strategy and simulated annealing (SA) cooling schedule control is designed as an action selection strategy. The excellent performance of the proposed method is demonstrated in a set of classical Atari games. Experimental results show that learning dynamic models in some games can improve sample efficiency. This benefit is maximized by choosing the proper planning steps. In the optimization planning phase, our method maintains a smaller gap with the current state-of-the-art model-based reinforcement learning (MuZero). In order to achieve a good compromise between model accuracy and optimal programming step size, it is necessary to control the programming reasonably. The practical application of this method in a physical robot system helps reduce the influence of an imprecise depth prediction model on the task. Without human supervision, it is easier to collect training data and learn complex skills (such as grabbing and carrying items) while being more effective at scaling tasks that have never been seen before.\n",

      "abstract": "Semi-autonomous telerobotic systems allow both humans and robots to exploit their strengths while enabling personalized execution of a remote task. For soft robots with kinematic structures dissimilar to those of human operators, it is unknown how the allocation of control between the human and the robot changes the performance. This work presents a set of interaction paradigms between a human and a remote soft-growing robot manipulator, with demonstrations in both real and simulated scenarios. The soft robot can grow and retract by eversion and inversion of its tubular body, a property we exploit in the interaction paradigms. We implemented and tested six different human-robot interaction paradigms, with full teleoperation at one extreme and gradually adding autonomy to various aspects of the task execution. All paradigms are demonstrated by two experts and two naive operators. Results show that humans and the soft robot manipulator can effectively split their control along different degrees of freedom while acting simultaneously to accomplish a task. In the simple pick-and-place task studied in this work, performance improves as the control is gradually given to the robot\u2019s autonomy, especially when the robot can correct certain human errors. However, human engagement is maximized when the control over a task is at least partially shared. Finally, when the human operator is assisted by haptic guidance, which is computed based on soft robot tip position errors, we observed that the improvement in performance is dependent on the expertise of the human operator.",

      "abstract": "Resilient control and cyber security are of great importance for multiagent systems (MASs) due to the vulnerability during their coordination through information interaction among agents. Unexpected cyber-attacks on a single agent can spread quickly and can affect critically the safety and the performance of the system. This paper proposes a distributed adaptive resilient neural network (NN)-based control procedure to guarantee its stability and to make the agents to follow the leader's profile when there exist cyber-attacks and external disturbances in the system. Firstly, an adaptive neural network is designed to estimate the nonlinear part of the MAS. Then, a variable structure super twisting approach is proposed in which the adaptive weights of the NN, and a virtual disturbance are designed adaptively via updating laws. Moreover, stability criteria and control objectives are investigated through Lyapunov theorem, which leads to a novel scheme that can handle nonlinearity, cyber-attacks, and external disturbances without requirement of designing different controllers in an extra algorithm and considering any limiting predefined condition such as Lipschitz on the nonlinear function. As an application, an adaptive cruise control of a platoon of connected automated vehicles is considered to scrutinize the proposed procedure in the absence and the presence of cyber-attacks, which verify the theoretical results.",

      "abstract": "Underwater autonomous driving devices, such as autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs), rely on visual sensors, but visual images tend to produce color aberrations and a high turbidity due to the scattering and absorption of underwater light. To address these issues, we propose the Dense Residual Generative Adversarial Network (DRGAN) for underwater image enhancement. Firstly, we adopt a multi-scale feature extraction module to obtain a range of information and increase the receptive field. Secondly, a dense residual block is proposed, to realize the interaction of image features and ensure stable connections in the feature information. Multiple dense residual modules are connected from beginning to end to form a cyclic dense residual network, producing a clear image. Finally, the stability of the network is improved via adjustment to the training with multiple loss functions. Experiments were conducted using the RUIE and Underwater ImageNet datasets. The experimental results show that our proposed DRGAN can remove high turbidity from underwater images and achieve color equalization better than other methods.",

      "abstract": "Nowadays, the cybersecurity of Internet of Thing (IoT) environments is a big challenge. The analysis of network traffic and the use of automated estimators built up with machine learning techniques have been useful in detecting intrusions in traditional networks. Since the IoT networks require new and particular protocols to control the communications between the different devices involved in the networks, the knowledge acquired in the study of general networks may be unuseful some times. The goal of this paper is twofold. On the one hand, we aim to obtain a consistent dataset of the network traffic of an IoT system based on the Message Queue Telemetry Transport protocol (MQTT) and undergoing certain type of attacks. On the other hand, we want to characterize each of these attacks in terms of the minimum possible number of significant variables allowed by this protocol. Obtaining the data set has been achieved by studying the MQTT protocol in depth, while its characterization has been addressed through a hybrid (filter/wrapper) feature selection algorithm based on the idea behind the minimum-redundancy maximum-relevance (mRMR) algorithm. The dataset, together with the feature selection algorithm, carries out a characterization of the different attacks which is optimal in terms of the accuracy of the machine learning models trained on it as well as in terms of the capability of explaining their underlying nature. This confirms the consistency of the dataset.",

      "abstract": "Considering the growing prominence of production-level AI and the threat of adversarial attacks that can poison a machine learning model against a certain label, evade classification, or reveal sensitive data about the model and training data to an attacker, adversaries pose fundamental problems to machine learning systems. Furthermore, much research has focused on the inverse relationship between robustness and accuracy, raising problems for real-time and safety-critical systems particularly since they are governed by legal constraints in which software changes must be explainable and every change must be thoroughly tested. While many defenses have been proposed, they are often computationally expensive and tend to reduce model accuracy. We have therefore conducted a large survey of attacks and defenses and present a simple and practical framework for analyzing any machine-learning system from a safety-critical perspective using adversarial noise to find the upper bound of the failure rate. Using this method, we conclude that all tested configurations of the ResNet architecture fail to meet any reasonable definition of \u2018safety-critical\u2019 when tested on even small-scale benchmark data. We examine state of the art defenses and attacks against computer vision systems with a focus on safety-critical applications in autonomous driving, industrial control, and healthcare. By testing a combination of attacks and defenses, their efficacy, and their run-time requirements, we provide substantial empirical evidence that modern neural networks consistently fail to meet established safety-critical standards by a wide margin.",

      "abstract": "Wildland fires, a natural calamity, pose a significant threat to both human lives and the environment while causing extensive economic damage. As the use of Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) with computer vision in disaster management continues to grow, there is a rising need for effective wildfire classification and localization. We propose a multi-stream hybrid deep learning model with a dual-stream attention mechanism for classifying wildfires from aerial and territorial images. Our proposed method incorporates a pre-trained EfficientNetB7 and customized Attention Connected Network (ACNet). This approach demonstrates exceptional classification performance on two widely recognized benchmark datasets. Bayesian optimization is employed for the purpose of refining and optimizing the hyperparameters of the model. The proposed model attains 97.45%, 98.20%, 97.10%, and 97.12% as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score, respectively, on the FLAME dataset. Moreover, while evaluated on the DeepFire dataset, the model achieves accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-scores of 95.97%, 95.19%, 96.01%, and 95.54%, respectively. The proposed method achieved a TNR of 95.5% and a TPR of 99.3% on the FLAME dataset, as well as a TNR of 94.47% and a TPR of 96.82% on the DeepFire dataset. This performance surpasses numerous state-of-the-art methods. To demonstrate the interpretability of our model, we incorporated the GRAD-CAM technique, which enables us to precisely identify the fire location within the feature map. This finding illustrates the efficacy of the model in accurately categorizing wildfires, even in areas with less fire activity.",

      "abstract": "Global warming presents a significant threat to the sustainability of agricultural systems, demanding increased irrigation to mitigate the impacts of prolonged dry seasons. Efficient water management strategies, including deficit irrigation, have thus become essential, requiring continuous crop monitoring. However, conventional monitoring methods are laborious and time-consuming. This study investigates the potential of aerial imagery captured by unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) to predict critical water stress indicators\u2014relative water content (RWC), midday leaf water potential (\u03a8MD), stomatal conductance (gs)\u2014as well as the pigment content (chlorophyll ab, chlorophyll a, chlorophyll b and carotenoids) of trees in an olive orchard. Both thermal and spectral vegetation indices are calculated and correlated using linear and exponential regression models. The results reveal that the thermal vegetation indices contrast in estimating the water stress indicators, with the Crop Water Stress Index (CWSI) demonstrating higher precision in predicting the RWC (R2 = 0.80), \u03a8MD (R2 = 0.61) and gs (R2 = 0.72). Additionally, the Triangular Vegetation Index (TVI) shows superior accuracy in predicting the chlorophyll ab (R2 = 0.64) and chlorophyll a (R2 = 0.61), while the Modified Chlorophyll Absorption in Reflectance Index (MCARI) proves most effective for estimating the chlorophyll b (R2 = 0.52). This study emphasizes the potential of UAV-based multispectral and thermal infrared imagery in precision agriculture, enabling assessments of the water status and pigment content. Moreover, these results highlight the vital importance of this technology in optimising resource allocation and enhancing olive production, critical steps towards sustainable agriculture in the face of global warming.",

      "abstract": "The additive processes used in the manufacture of components for unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), from composite filaments, have an important advantage compared to classical technologies. This study focused on three-dimensional design, preliminary aerodynamic analysis, fabrication and assembly of thermoplastic extruded composite components, flight testing and search-rescue performance of an UAV. The UAV model was designed to have the highest possible structural strength (the fuselage has a structure with stiffening frames and the wing is a tri-spar), but also taking into account the limitations of the thermoplastic extrusion process. From the preliminary aerodynamic analysis of the UAV model, it was found that the maximum lift coefficient of 1.2 and the maximum drag coefficient of 0.06 were obtained at the angle of attack of 12\u00b0. After conducting flight tests, it can be stated that the UAV model, with components manufactured by the thermoplastic extrusion process, presented high stability and maneuverability, a wide range of speeds and good aerodynamic characteristics. The lack of this type of aircraft, equipped with electric motors, a traffic management system, and a thermal module designed for search-and-rescue missions, within the additive manufacturing UAV market, validates the uniqueness of the innovation of the UAV model presented in the current paper.",

      "abstract": "In the evolving economic landscape, Industry 4.0 emphasizes strategic planning and operational progress for large enterprises. This transformation relies on smart robotization technologies like AGVs (Automated Guided Vehicles) and AMRs (Autonomous Mobile Robots) for reducing transportation time, thereby reducing energy costs per unit of production, increasing energy efficiency, as well as replacing combustible-fuel-powered tools with electric ones. A number of concerns arise with their introduction into the production cycle. This research aims to provide a methodical basis for averting substantial mistakes when executing projects centered around the incorporation of AGVs/AMRs into in-house logistics systems. The FMEA method and empirical analysis were employed to achieve a more accurate risk assessment. APIS and MS Excel softwares were chosen. We investigated the potential hazards related to the incorporation of mobile robotic solutions and identified both external and internal threats. To streamline and improve project efficiency, a risk management algorithm for high-tech projects is presented in the paper. Integrating FMEA into projects implementing robotic technologies can lead to significant enhancements in risk reduction, and therefore cost savings, efficiency, safety, and quality, while fostering a culture of collaboration and problem solving. The research contributes to the literature by introducing an AMR planning and control framework to guide managers in the decision-making process, thereby supporting them to achieve optimal performance. Finally, we propose an agenda for future research within the field of interest.",

Our solution involves the usage of the physical unclonable function (PUF) and blockchain technology for key exchange. PUF also ensures security against physical tampering, and blockchain is applied to share the symmetric key among the base stations. After the registration, the later communication messages are encrypted with AES-GCM to provide authentication and confidentiality between the parties. We conducted a security analysis of the registration protocol using the ProVerif tool, and our solution meets the security requirements, including the mutual authentication of entities, key freshness, key secrecy and also key confirmation properties. Besides the Proverif-based analysis, an informal security analysis is also provided that shows that the registration is protected against a variety of well-known active and passive security attacks. As drone resources are limited, we also prepared a proof of concept to test our solution under real-life conditions, focusing on efficiency and lightweight operations.",

      "abstract": "This study leverages the Semantic Segmentation of Underwater Imagery (SUIM) dataset, encompassing over 1,500 meticulously annotated images that delineate eight distinct object categories. These categories encompass a diverse array, ranging from vertebrate fish and invertebrate reefs to aquatic vegetation, wreckage, human divers, robots, and the seafloor. The use of this dataset involves a methodical synthesis of data through extensive oceanic expeditions and collaborative experiments, featuring both human participants and robots. The research extends its scope to evaluating cutting-edge semantic segmentation techniques, employing established metrics to gauge their performance comprehensively. Additionally, we introduce a fully convolutional encoder-decoder model designed with a dual purpose: delivering competitive performance and computational efficiency. Notably, this model boasts a remarkable accuracy of 88%, underscoring its proficiency in underwater image segmentation. Furthermore, this model's integration within the autonomy pipeline of visually-guided underwater robots presents its tangible applicability. Its rapid end-to-end inference capability addresses the exigencies of real-time decision-making, vital for autonomous systems. This study elucidates the model's practical benefits across diverse applications like visual serving, saliency prediction, and intricate scene comprehension. Crucially, the utilization of the Enhanced Super-Resolution Generative Adversarial Network (ESRGAN) elevates image quality, enriching the foundation upon which our model's success rests. This research establishes a solid groundwork for future exploration in underwater robot vision by presenting the model and the benchmark dataset.",

      "abstract": "New England salt marshes provide many services to humans and the environment, but these landscapes are threatened by drivers such as sea level rise. Mapping the distribution of salt marsh plant species can help resource managers better monitor these ecosystems. Because salt marsh species often have spatial distributions that change over horizontal distances of less than a meter, accurately mapping this type of vegetation requires the use of high-spatial-resolution data. Previous work has proven that unoccupied aerial vehicle (UAV)-acquired imagery can provide this level of spatial resolution. However, despite many advances in remote sensing mapping methods over the last few decades, limited research focuses on which spectral band, elevation layer, and acquisition date combinations produce the most accurate species classification mappings from UAV imagery within salt marsh landscapes. Thus, our work classified and assessed various combinations of these characteristics of UAV imagery for mapping the distribution of plant species within these ecosystems. The results revealed that red, green, and near-infrared camera image band composites produced more accurate image classifications than true-color camera-band composites. The addition of an elevation layer within image composites further improved classification accuracies, particularly between species with similar spectral characteristics, such as two forms of dominant salt marsh cord grasses (Spartina alterniflora) that live at different elevations from each other. Finer assessments of misclassifications between other plant species pairs provided us with additional insights into the dynamics of why classification total accuracies differed between assessed image composites. The results also suggest that seasonality can significantly affect classification accuracies. The methods and findings utilized in this study may provide resource managers with increased precision in detecting otherwise subtle changes in vegetation patterns over time that can inform future management strategies.",

      "abstract": "Signcryption is a highly efficient approach to simultaneously achieving message confidentiality and authentication in Human-Centered IoT (HC-IoT) systems. HCIoT is a new field of study that links various aspects of life such as smart cards, business, e-commerce, healthcare, and sensitive private data. A number of intelligent systems favor human intervention to start automated tasks. A number of smart devices have a social effect in that they should be capable of changing their functional model based on the behavior of different humans. It has boosted the development of information exchange over the IoT and enabled networks. It encompasses cellular, vehicular, and human healthcare by utilizing middleware. Currently, group signcryption schemes are gaining widespread popularity in HC-IoT environments. HC-IoT is useful in electronic cash systems, lightweight devices, multi-server networks, and more. However, most signcryption schemes use bilinear pairing that is computationally intensive, and there is a need for more efficient signcryption schemes. In order to solve this issue, this paper introduces an efficient Certificateless Group-oriented Signcryption (CGS) scheme using Quantum Chebyshev Chaotic Maps (QCCM) without employing bilinear pairing. The proposed QCCM-CGS scheme\u2019s standout feature is that any group signcrypter can signcrypt a text/information with the group manager (GM) and then present it to the verifier for verification. By using the public conditions of the group, the verifier approves the validity of the signcrypted text and cannot connect the signcrypted text to the conforming signcrypter. However, a legitimate signcrypted text cannot be generated even by the GM or any signcrypter of that group unaccompanied. In situations where there is a legal disagreement, such as non-repudiation of the signature, the GM can reveal the identity of the signcrypter. The presented scheme is adequately secured from the indistinguishably chosen ciphertext attack. The computationally challenging problem, QCCM, is used as the foundation for the construction of traceability, unforgeability, unlinkability, and security. Lastly, the security review of the projected scheme clearly shows significant consistency, and it can be easily deployed in vulnerable security applications.",

      "abstract": "Multi-agent multi-target search strategies can be utilized in complex scenarios such as post-disaster search and rescue by unmanned aerial vehicles. To solve the problem of fixed target and trajectory, the current multi-agent multi-target search strategies are mainly based on deep reinforcement learning (DRL). However, the training of agents by the DRL tend to be brittle due to their sensitivity to the training environment, which makes the strategies learned by the agents fall into local optima frequently, resulting in poor system robustness. Additionally, sparse rewards in DRL will lead to the problems such as difficulty in system convergence and low utilization efficiency of the sampled data. To address the problem that the robustness of the agents is weakened and the sparse rewards exist in the multi-objective search environment, we propose a MiniMax Multi-agent Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient based on the Parallel Hindsight Experience Replay (PHER-M3DDPG) algorithm, which adopts the framework of centralized training and decentralized execution in continuous action space. To enhance the system robustness, the PHER-M3DDPG algorithm employs a minimax learning architecture, which adaptively adjusts the learning strategy of agents by involving adversarial disturbances. In addition, to solve the sparse rewards problem, the PHER-M3DDPG algorithm adopts a parallel hindsight experience replay mechanism to increase the efficiency of data utilization by involving virtual learning targets and batch processing of the sampled data. Simulation results show that the PHER-M3DDPG algorithm outperforms the existing algorithms in terms of convergence speed and the task completion time in a multi-target search environment.",

      "abstract": "The unmanned combat aerial vehicle (UCAV) technology has to deal with a lot of challenges in complex battlefield environments. The UCAV requires a high number of points to build the path to avoid dangers in order to achieve a safe and low-energy flying path, which increases the issue dimension and uses more computer resources while producing unstable results. To address the issue, this paper proposes a double-layer (DLC) model for path planning, which reduces the outputting dimension of path-forming points, reduces the computational cost and enhances the path stability. Meanwhile, this paper improves the grey wolf optimizer (K-FDGWO) by introducing adaptive K-neighbourhood-based learning strategy and differential \u201chunger-hunting strategy\u201d, and using fitness distance correlation (FDC) to balance the global exploration and local exploitation. Besides, the K-FDGWO and Differential Evolution (DE) algorithm are jointly used for the DLC model (DLC-K-FDGWO). The experimental results indicated that the proposed DLC-K-FDGWO method for path planning always generated the ideal flight path in complicated environments.",

      "abstract": "The increasing frequency of global drought events poses a significant threat to the stability of grassland ecosystems\u2019 functionality. The Inner Mongolian grasslands stand out as one of the world\u2019s most drought-prone regions, facing elevated drought risks compared to other biomes. An in-depth comprehension of the impact of drought on grassland ecosystems is paramount for their long-term sustainability. Using the Standardized Precipitation Evapotranspiration Index (SPEI) from 1982 to 2018, this study identified various drought events within the Inner Mongolian grasslands, encompassing moderate drought, severe drought, and extreme drought. The resistance of the vegetation to the different drought conditions, assessed through net primary productivity (NPP) as a metric (reflecting its capacity to maintain its original level during drought periods), was examined. The research findings indicated that the period from 2001 to 2018 witnessed a substantial increase in both the frequency and the extent of drought events compared to the period from 1982 to 2000, particularly concerning severe and extreme droughts. The areas most severely impacted by extreme drought were the Xilingol League and the Alxa League. From 1982\u20132000 to 2001\u20132018, under moderate drought conditions, vegetation resistance exhibited a minor decrease in the central and eastern regions but experienced a slight increase in the western region. In contrast, under severe drought conditions, the western region saw a significant decrease in vegetation resistance. Remarkably, under extreme drought conditions, the western region showed a substantial increase in vegetation resistance, while the central and eastern regions experienced a slight decrease. Across all three drought conditions, as precipitation levels declined, the resistance of the meadow\u2013steppe\u2013desert ecosystems demonstrated a high\u2013low\u2013high distribution pattern. The temperate desert steppe exhibited a minimal vulnerability to drought, boasting resistance levels exceeding 0.9. Notably, extreme drought had the most pronounced impact on the temperate meadow steppe, temperate steppe, and temperate desert steppe, particularly within the temperate meadow steppe category. Given these findings, the authorities responsible for grassland management should prioritize regions characterized by frequent drought occurrences and low drought resistance, such as Ulanqab City, the Xilingol League, and the western part of Hulun Buir City. Safeguarding steppe ecosystems is of paramount importance for stabilizing vegetation productivity and land carbon sinks, especially under the anticipated exacerbation of climate conditions in the future.",

      "abstract": "In smart cities, unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVS) play a vital role in surveillance, monitoring, and data collection. However, the widespread integration of UAVs brings forth a pressing concern: security and privacy vulnerabilities. This study introduces the SP-IoUAV (Secure and Privacy Preserving Intrusion Detection and Prevention for UAVS) model, tailored specifically for the Internet of UAVs ecosystem. The challenge lies in safeguarding UAV operations and ensuring data confidentiality. Our model employs cutting-edge techniques, including federated learning, differential privacy, and secure multi-party computation. These fortify data confidentiality and enhance intrusion detection accuracy. Central to our approach is the integration of deep neural networks (DNNs) like the convolutional neural network-long short-term memory (CNN-LSTM) network, enabling real-time anomaly detection and precise threat identification. This empowers UAVs to make immediate decisions in dynamic environments. To proactively counteract security breaches, we have implemented a real-time decision mechanism triggering alerts and initiating automatic blacklisting. Furthermore, multi-factor authentication (MFA) strengthens access security for the intrusion detection system (IDS) database. The SP-IoUAV model not only establishes a comprehensive machine framework for safeguarding UAV operations but also advocates for secure and privacy-preserving machine learning in UAVS. Our model\u2019s effectiveness is validated using the CIC-IDS2017 dataset, and the comparative analysis showcases its superiority over previous approaches like FCL-SBL, RF-RSCV, and RBFNNs, boasting exceptional levels of accuracy (99.98%), precision (99.93%), recall (99.92%), and F-Score (99.92%).",

      "abstract": "With the influence of climate change and human activities, the frequency and scale of forest fires have been increasing continuously, posing a significant threat to the environment and human safety. Therefore, rapid and accurate forest fire detection has become essential for effective control of forest fires. This study proposes a Forest Fire Detection and Segmentation Model (FFDSM) based on unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) infrared images to address the problems of forest fire occlusion and the poor adaptability of traditional forest fire detection methods. The FFDSM integrates the YOLO (You Only Look Once) v5s-seg, Efficient Channel Attention (ECA), and Spatial Pyramid Pooling Fast Cross-Stage Partial Channel (SPPFCSPC) to improve the detection accuracy of forest fires of different sizes. The FFDSM enhances the detection and extraction capabilities of forest fire features, enabling the accurate segmentation of forest fires of different sizes and shapes. Furthermore, we conducted ablation and controlled experiments on different attention mechanisms, spatial pyramid pooling (SPP) modules, and fire sizes to verify the effectiveness of the added modules and the adaptability of the FFDSM model. The results of the ablation experiment show that, compared to the original YOLOv5s-seg model, the models fused with the ECA and SPPFCSPC achieve an improved accuracy, with FFDSM showing the greatest improvement. FFDSM achieves a 2.1% increase in precision, a 2.7% increase in recall, a 2.3% increase in mAP@0.5, and a 4.2% increase in mAP@0.5:0.95. The results of the controlled experiments on different attention mechanisms and SPP modules demonstrate that the ECA+SPPFCSPC model (FFDSM) performs the best, with a precision, recall, mAP@0.5, and mAP@0.5:0.95 reaching 0.959, 0.870, 0.907, and 0.711, respectively. The results of the controlled experiment on different fire sizes show that FFDSM outperforms YOLOv5s-seg for all three fire sizes, and it performs the best for small fires, with a precision, recall, mAP@0.5, and mAP@0.5:0.95 reaching 0.989, 0.938, 0.964, and 0.769, respectively, indicating its good adaptability for early forest fire detection. The results indicate that the forest fire detection model based on UAV infrared images (FFDSM) proposed in this study exhibits a high detection accuracy. It is proficient in identifying obscured fires in optical images and demonstrates good adaptability in various fire scenarios. The model effectively enables real-time detection and provides early warning of forest fires, providing valuable support for forest fire prevention and scientific decision making.",

      "abstract": "Anti-jamming communication technology is one of the most critical technologies for establishing secure and reliable communication between unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) and ground units. The current research on anti-jamming technology focuses primarily on the power and spatial domains and does not target the issue of intelligent jammer attacks on communication channels. We propose a game-theoretical center frequency selection method for UAV-enabled air-to-ground (A2G) networks to address this challenge. Specifically, we model the central frequency selection problem as a Stackelberg game between the UAV and the jammer, where the UAV is the leader and the jammer is the follower. We develop a formal matrix structure for characterizing the payoff of the UAV and the jammer and theoretically prove that the mixed Nash equilibrium of such a bimatrix Stackelberg game is equivalent to the optimal solution of a linear programming model. Then, we propose an efficient game algorithm via linear programming. Building on this foundation, we champion an efficacious algorithm, underpinned by our novel linear programming solution paradigm, ensuring computational feasibility with polynomial time complexity. Simulation experiments show that our game-theoretical approach can achieve Nash equilibrium and outperform traditional schemes, including the Frequency-Hopping Spread Spectrum (FHSS) and the Random Selection (RS) schemes, in terms of higher payoff and better stability.",

      "abstract": "On-line motion planning in dynamically changing environments poses a significant challenge in the design of autonomous robotic system. Conventional methods often require intricate design choices, while modern deep reinforcement learning (DRL) approaches demand vast amounts of robot motion data. Gaussian process (GP) regression-based imitation learning approaches address such issues by harnessing the GP\u2019s data-efficient learning capabilities to infer generalized policies from a limited number of demonstrations, which can intuitively be generated by human operators. GP-based methods, however, are limited in data scalability as computation becomes cubically expensive as the amount of learned data increases. This issue is addressed by proposing Voronoi tessellation sampling, a novel data sampling strategy for learning GP-based robotic motion planning, where spatial correlation between input features and the output of the trajectory prediction model is exploited to select the data to be learned that are informative yet learnable by the model. Where the baseline is set by an imitation learning framework that uses GP regression to infer trajectories that learns policies optimized via a stochastic, reward-based optimization algorithm, experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method can learn optimal policies spanning over all of feature space using fewer data compared to the baseline method.",

      "abstract": "Over the past several years, significant progress has been made in object tracking, but challenges persist in tracking objects in high-resolution images captured from drones. Such images usually contain very tiny objects, and the movement of the drone causes rapid changes in the scene. In addition, the computing power of mission computers on drones is often insufficient to achieve real-time processing of deep learning-based object tracking. This paper presents a real-time on-drone pedestrian tracker that takes as the input 4K aerial images. The proposed tracker effectively hides the long latency required for deep learning-based detection (e.g., YOLO) by exploiting both the CPU and GPU equipped in the mission computer. We also propose techniques to minimize detection loss in drone-captured images, including a tracker-assisted confidence boosting and an ensemble for identity association. In our experiments, using real-world inputs captured by drones at a height of 50 m, the proposed method with an NVIDIA Jetson TX2 proves its efficacy by achieving real-time detection and tracking in 4K video streams.",

      "abstract": "In the present two-dimensional numerical study, we investigate the roles of geometrical parameters of a hydrofoil (shape/curvature of the leading and trailing edges and thickness) and kinematic parameters (phase difference between heave and pitch (\u03d5)) on the propulsive performance of different-shaped hydrofoils oscillating at maximum angles of attack up to \u03b1max=30\u2218. The study was carried out at a fixed non-dimensional maximum heave to chord ratio h\u2218/C=0.75, Strouhal number St=0.25, and Reynolds number Re=5000. Our findings reveal that hydrofoil performance and stability improve with leading and trailing edge curvatures but decline as thickness increases. By analyzing the near-wake structure, we establish that even minimal flow separation increases power consumption while moderate flow separation enhances thrust. Over the range of different-shaped hydrofoils at different \u03b1max and \u03d5, maximum propulsion efficiency occurs for those parameters for which there is a small degree of flow separation but with no roll-up of a separating vortex. In comparison, maximum thrust generation occurs when there is a moderately strong flow separation but without induction of a significant amount of fluid around the trailing edge. These insights offer valuable knowledge for understanding fish propulsion efficiency and have applications in designing autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs) and micro-air vehicles (MAVs).",

      "abstract": "In recent years, the rapid progress of Internet of Things (IoT) solutions has offered an immense opportunity for the collection and dissemination of health records in a central data platform. Electrocardiogram (ECG), a fast, easy, and non-invasive method, is generally employed in the evaluation of heart conditions that lead to heart ailments and the identification of heart diseases. The deployment of IoT devices for arrhythmia classification offers many benefits such as remote patient care, continuous monitoring, and early recognition of abnormal heart rhythms. However, it is challenging to diagnose and manually classify arrhythmia as the manual diagnosis of ECG signals is a time-consuming process. Therefore, the current article presents the automated arrhythmia classification using the Farmland Fertility Algorithm with Hybrid Deep Learning (AAC-FFAHDL) approach in the IoT platform. The proposed AAC-FFAHDL system exploits the hyperparameter-tuned DL model for ECG signal analysis, thereby diagnosing arrhythmia. In order to accomplish this, the AAC-FFAHDL technique initially performs data pre-processing to scale the input signals into a uniform format. Further, the AAC-FFAHDL technique uses the HDL approach for detection and classification of arrhythmia. In order to improve the classification and detection performance of the HDL approach, the AAC-FFAHDL technique involves an FFA-based hyperparameter tuning process. The proposed AAC-FFAHDL approach was validated through simulation using the benchmark ECG database. The comparative experimental analysis outcomes confirmed that the AAC-FFAHDL system achieves promising performance compared with other models under different evaluation measures.",

      "abstract": "Visual place recognition is a core component of visual information analysis, which serves for the position and orientation perception of autonomous driving and robotics. The current place recognition methods usually rely on image retrieval techniques to identify the visual similarity between query and gallery images. However, state-of-the-art image retrieval methods are often based on extensive labels, such as matched pairs (e.g., the image correspondences). Besides, image retrieval methods heavily suffer from environmental condition changes (i.e., a large range of illumination and weather changes). To alleviate the annotation cost, we introduce contrastive learning to perform feature extraction and feature similarity measurement in a self-supervised manner. Considering the heavy data augmentations of the existing contrastive learning approaches cannot effectively simulate domain disparities, we design the generative adversarial model to promote the extraction of domain-agnostic features. To tightly integrate the domain-agnostic representations and self-supervision, we design a self-generated soft constraint to achieve domain-agnostic contrastive learning (termed \u201cDaCo\u201d). Extensive experiments and analysis on cross-illumination and cross-weather settings are conducted on three challenging datasets. The proposed \u201cDaCo\u201d outperforms current contrastive learning based image retrieval methods by a large margin.",

Effectively avoiding threats and improving the survivability of fixed-wing UAV in dynamic hostile environments are the keys to the success of combat missions. Hence, endowing fixed-wing UAVs with the ability to autonomously generate evasive maneuver is the primary problem that should be solved. With considering the threat of air-to-air missile attacks, this paper designs a novel hierarchical goal-guided learning (HGGL) method, which combines with traditional off-policy deep reinforcement learning (DRL) algorithms and endows the agent with the ability to evade a series of air-to-air missiles. The pivotal idea of the proposed algorithm is to use the hierarchical features of the goal, it improves the availability of training data to eliminate the limitation of the convergence rate of traditional DRL algorithms owing to sparse rewards. We demonstrate the performance of our algorithm in several simulation experiments. All experiments are applied on the XSimStudio platform. The results demonstrate that the proposed algorithm improves the convergence speed and outperforms the state-of-the-art traditional algorithms.",

      "abstract": "Coal seams were buried extremely shallowly in the trench slope area, which is prone to inducing surface cracks, seriously threatening the surface environment and mine safety production. The development of surface mining cracks varies at different locations in the trench slope area. In this research, we aimed to study the dynamic characteristics and laws of surface crack widths at different mining locations in the trench slope area and reveal the evolution mechanism of surface crack widths. Taking the 125,203 working face in Anshan Coal Mine in Shaanxi Province, China, as the geological prototype, we analyzed the full-cycle dynamic change law and planar distribution law of the surface crack widths in the trench slope area by combining the unmanned aerial vehicle remote sensing technology and field actual measurements and revealed the dynamic evolution mechanism of surface mining cracks in the trench area. The research results showed that the dynamic changes of surface crack widths varied at different locations of the slope. The surface crack width in the downslope area increased first and then stabilized with the advance of the working surface; the crack width at the bottom of the trench shows the dynamic change characteristic of increasing\u2013decreasing\u2013slightly increasing\u2013stabilizing with the continuous advance of the working surface. The surface crack width in the upslope area showed the dynamic change of increasing\u2013decreasing\u2013stabilizing with the continuous advance of the working surface. Influenced by the surface morphology, the development mechanisms of surface mining cracks were different. The research results can provide practical guidance for selecting the best treatment time for surface cracks in different areas.",

      "abstract": "With the progression of marine exploration and exploitation, as well as the advancements in mechanical intelligence, the utilization of the unmanned surface vehicle (USV) and the design of their guidance system have become prominent areas of focus. However, the stern ramp recovery of the USV is still in its infancy due to its unique attitude requirements and automation design. Furthermore, few studies have addressed the impact of maritime disturbances, with most research limited to simulations. To enhance the efficiency and accuracy of stern ramp recovery, this paper presents the development and construction of a novel recovery system. By incorporating physical modeling of disturbance forces acting on USVs at sea, the practicality of the system is improved. Additionally, an optimized genetic algorithm is introduced in the navigation module to improve convergence rates and subsequently enhance recovery efficiency. A line-of-sight (LOS) algorithm based on average velocity is proposed in this paper to ensure the attainment of unique attitude requirements and to improve the effectiveness of stern chute recovery. This paper provides a detailed description of the independently designed USV hardware system. Moreover, simulations and practical experiments conducted using this experimental platform are presented, offering a new solution for the USV\u2019s stern ramp recovery.",

      "abstract": "Detection of deception attacks is pivotal to ensure the safe and reliable operation of cyber-physical systems (CPS). Detection of such attacks needs to consider time-series sequences and is very challenging especially for autonomous vehicles that rely on high-dimensional observations from camera sensors. The paper presents an approach to detect deception attacks in real-time utilizing sensor observations, with a special focus on high-dimensional observations. The approach is based on inductive conformal anomaly detection (ICAD) and utilizes a novel generative model which consists of a variational autoencoder (VAE) and a recurrent neural network (RNN) that is used to learn both spatial and temporal features of the normal dynamic behavior of the system. The model can be used to predict the observations for multiple time steps, and the predictions are then compared with actual observations to efficiently quantify the nonconformity of a sequence under attack relative to the expected normal behavior, thereby enabling real-time detection of attacks using high-dimensional sequential data. We evaluate the approach empirically using two simulation case studies of an advanced emergency braking system and an autonomous car racing example, as well as a real-world secure water treatment dataset. The experiments show that the proposed method outperforms other detection methods, and in most experiments, both false positive and false negative rates are less than 10%. Furthermore, execution times measured on both powerful cloud machines and embedded devices are relatively short, thereby enabling real-time detection.",

      "abstract": "As a safety-related application, visual systems based on deep neural networks (DNNs) in modern unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) show adversarial vulnerability when performing real-time inference. Recently, deep ensembles with various defensive strategies against adversarial samples have drawn much attention due to the increased diversity and reduced variance for their members. Aimed at the recognition task of remote sensing images (RSIs), this paper proposes to use a reactive-proactive ensemble defense framework to solve the security problem. In reactive defense, we fuse scoring functions of several classical detection algorithms with the hidden features and average output confidences from sub-models as a second fusion. In terms of proactive defense, we attempt two strategies, including enhancing the robustness of each sub-model and limiting the transferability among sub-models. In practical applications, the real-time RSIs are first input to the reactive defense part, which can detect and reject the adversarial RSIs. The accepted ones are then passed to robust recognition with a proactive defense. We conduct extensive experiments on three benchmark RSI datasets (i.e., UCM, AID, and FGSC-23). The experimental results show that the deep ensemble method of reactive and proactive defense performs very well in gradient-based attacks. The analysis of the applicable attack scenarios for each proactive ensemble defense is also helpful for this field. We also perform a case study with the whole framework in the black-box scenario, and the highest detection rate reaches 93.25%. Most of the adversarial RSIs can be rejected in advance or correctly recognized by the enhanced deep ensemble. This article is the first one to combine reactive and proactive defenses with a deep ensemble against adversarial attacks in the context of RSI recognition for DNN-based UAVs.",

      "abstract": "Flapping Wing Air Vehicles (FWAVs) have proven to be attractive alternatives to fixed wing and rotary air vehicles at low speeds because of their bio-inspired ability to hover and maneuver. However, in the past, they have not been able to reach their full potential due to limitations in wing control and payload capacity, which also has limited endurance. Many previous FWAVs used a single actuator that couples and synchronizes motions of the wings to flap both wings, resulting in only variable rate flapping control at a constant amplitude. Independent wing control is achieved using two servo actuators that enable wing motions for FWAVs by programming positions and velocities to achieve desired wing shapes and associated aerodynamic forces. However, having two actuators integrated into the flying platform significantly increases its weight and makes it more challenging to achieve flight than a single actuator. This article presents a retrospective overview of five different designs from the \u201cRobo Raven\u201d family based on our previously published work. The first FWAVs utilize two servo motors to achieve independent wing control. The basic platform is capable of successfully performing dives, flips, and button hook turns, which demonstrates the potential maneuverability afforded by the independently actuated and controlled wings. Subsequent designs in the Robo Raven family were able to use multifunctional wings to harvest solar energy to overcome limitations on endurance, use on-board decision-making capabilities to perform maneuvers autonomously, and use mixed-mode propulsion to increase payload capacity by exploiting the benefits of fixed and flapping wing flight. This article elucidates how each successive version of the Robo Raven platform built upon the findings from previous generations. The Robo Raven family collectively addresses requirements related to control autonomy, energy autonomy, and maneuverability. We conclude this article by identifying new opportunities for research in avian-scale flapping wing aerial vehicles.",

      "abstract": "To deploy Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) inside heterogeneous GPS-denied confined (potentially unknown) spaces, such as those encountered in mining and Urban Search and Rescue (USAR), requires the enhancement of numerous technologies. Of special interest is for UAVs to identify collision-freeSafe Flight Corridors (SFC+) within highly cluttered convex- and non-convex-shaped environments, which requires UAVs to perform advanced flight maneuvers while exploiting their flying capabilities. Within this paper, a novel auxiliary occupancy checking process that augments traditional 3D flight corridor generation is proposed. The 3D flight corridor is established as a topological structure based on a hand-crafted path either derived from a computer-generated environment or provided by the human operator, which captures humans\u2019 preferences and desired flight intentions for the given space. This corridor is formulated as a series of interconnected overlapping convex polyhedra bounded by the perceived environmental geometries, which facilitates the generation of suitable 3D flight paths/trajectories that avoid local minima within the corridor boundaries. An occupancy check algorithm is employed to reduce the search space needed to identify 3D obstacle-free spaces in which their constructed polyhedron geometries are replaced with alternate convex polyhedra. To assess the feasibility and efficiency of the proposed SFC+ methodology, a comparative study is conducted against the Star-Convex Method (SCM), a prominent algorithm in the field. The results reveal the superiority of the proposed SFC+ methodology in terms of its computational efficiency and reduced search space for UAV maneuvering solutions. Various challenging confined-environment scenarios, each with different obstacle densities (confined scenarios), are utilized to verify the obtained outcomes.",

      "abstract": "Higher-level autonomous driving necessitates the best possible execution of important moves under all conditions. Most of the accidents in recent years caused by the AVs launched by leading automobile manufacturers are due to inadequate decision-making, which is a result of their poor perceivance of environmental information. In today\u2019s technology-bound scenarios, versatile sensors are used by AVs to collect environmental information. Due to various technical and natural calamities, the environmental information acquired by the sensors may not be complete and clear, due to which the AVs may misinterpret the information in a different context, leading to inadequate decision-making, which may then lead to fatal accidents. To overcome this drawback, effective preprocessing of raw sensory data is a mandatory task. Pre-processing the sensory data involves two vital tasks, namely data cleaning and data fusion. Since the raw sensory data are complex and exhibit multimodal characteristics, more emphasis is given to data preprocessing. Since more innovative models have been proposed for data cleaning, this study focused on data fusion. In particular, this study proposed a generic data fusion engine, which classifies different formats of sensory data and fuses them accordingly to improve accuracy. This study proposed a generic framework to fuse the text, image, and audio data. In the first stage of this research, an innovative hybrid model was proposed to fuse multispectral image and video data. Simple and efficient models to extract the salient image features were also proposed. The hybrid image fusion model that was proposed did not yield satisfactory outcomes when combining 3D point cloud data, and its performance declined when evaluating large datasets. To address this issue, the study expanded by introducing an advanced generative adversarial network (GAN) to transform the hybrid image fusion model into a machine learning model capable of handling substantial datasets. Additionally, customized kernel functions were suggested to fuse 3D point cloud data effectively. The performance of the proposed models was assessed using standard metrics and datasets, comparing them with existing popular models. The results revealed that the proposed image fusion model outperformed the other models.",

      "abstract": "Target assignment has been a hot topic of research in the academic and industrial communities for swarms of multiple unmanned aerial vehicle (multi-UAVs). Traditional methods mainly focus on cooperative target assignment in planes, and they ignore three-dimensional scenarios for the multi-UAV network target assignment problem. This paper proposes a method for target assignment in three-dimensional scenarios based on evolutionary game theory to achieve cooperative targeting for multi-UAVs, significantly improving operational efficiency and achieving maximum utility. Firstly, we construct an evolutionary game model including game participants, a tactical strategy space, a payoff matrix, and a strategy selection probability space. Then, a multi-level information fusion algorithm is designed to evaluate the overall attack effectiveness of multi-UAVs against multiple targets. The replicator equation is leveraged to obtain the evolutionarily stable strategy (ESS) and dynamically update the optimal strategy. Finally, a typical scenario analysis and an effectiveness experiment are carried out on the RflySim platform to analyze the calculation process and verify the effectiveness of the proposed method. The results show that the proposed method can effectively provide a target assignment solution for multi-UAVs.",

      "abstract": "Autonomous and robotic systems are increasingly being trusted with sensitive activities with potentially serious consequences if that trust is broken. Runtime verification techniques present a natural source of inspiration for monitoring and enforcing the desirable properties of the communication protocols in place, providing a formal basis and ways to limit intrusiveness. A recently proposed approach, RV-TEE, shows how runtime verification can enhance the level of trust to the Rich Execution Environment (REE), consequently adding a further layer of protection around the Trusted Execution Environment (TEE). By reflecting on the implication of deploying RV in the context of trustworthy computing, we propose practical solutions to two threat models for the RV-TEE monitoring process: one where the adversary has gained access to the system without elevated privileges, and another where the adversary gains all privileges to the host system but fails to steal secrets from the TEE.

      "abstract": "The diagnosis of early-stage lung cancer can be challenging due to several factors. Firstly, the asymptomatic nature of the disease means that it may not present any noticeable symptoms until it has progressed to later stages. Additionally, the use of computed tomography, which can be expensive and involves repetitive radiation exposure, can further complicate the diagnostic process. Even specialists may encounter difficulties when examining lung CT imagery to identify pulmonary nodules, particularly in the case of cell lung adenocarcinoma lesions.This paper suggests a unique deep learning-based Deep Convolutional Generative Adversarial Networks (DCGAN) model for lung cancer classification. The dataset utilized for the experimental purpose is accessed from the LUNA16 challenge database. This comprises 888 CT scans of the lungs. These images are initially segmented using Quick-CapsNet (QCN) model and applied with Red Deer Optimization (RDO) algorithm to extract the optimized features. Furthermore, the categorization between benign and malignant tumors is carried out using the DC-GAN model. The pulmonary nodule detection accuracy of the proposed model is 98.65%, indicating early-stage lung cancer. It is discovered to be superior to other existing techniques, such as sophisticated deep learning, straightforward machine learning, and hybrid methods applied to lung CT scans for nodule diagnosis. According to experimental findings, the suggested way can significantly help radiologists spot early lung cancer and facilitate prompt patient management.",

      "abstract": "In this paper, we propose a comparison of open-source LiDAR and Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU)-based Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM) approaches for 3D robotic mapping. The analyzed algorithms are often exploited in mobile robotics for autonomous navigation but have not been evaluated in terms of 3D reconstruction yet. Experimental tests are carried out using two different autonomous mobile platforms in three test cases, comprising both indoor and outdoor scenarios. The 3D models obtained with the different SLAM algorithms are then compared in terms of density, accuracy, and noise of the point clouds to analyze the performance of the evaluated approaches. The experimental results indicate the SLAM methods that are more suitable for 3D mapping in terms of the quality of the reconstruction and highlight the feasibility of mobile robotics in the field of autonomous mapping.",

      "abstract": "Non-line-of-sight (NLOS) imaging allows for the imaging of objects around a corner, which enables potential applications in various fields, such as autonomous driving, robotic vision, medical imaging, security monitoring, etc. However, the quality of reconstruction is challenged by low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) measurements. In this study, we present a regularization method, referred to as structure sparsity (SS) regularization, for denoising in NLOS reconstruction. By exploiting the prior knowledge of structure sparseness, we incorporate nuclear norm penalization into the cost function of the directional light-cone transform (DLCT) model for the NLOS imaging system. This incorporation effectively integrates the neighborhood information associated with the directional albedo, thereby facilitating the denoising process. Subsequently, the reconstruction is achieved by optimizing a directional albedo model with SS regularization using the fast iterative shrinkage-thresholding algorithm (FISTA). Notably, the robust reconstruction of occluded objects is observed. Through comprehensive evaluations conducted on both synthetic and experimental datasets, we demonstrate that the proposed approach yields high-quality reconstructions, surpassing the state-of-the-art reconstruction algorithms, especially in scenarios involving short exposure and low-SNR measurements.",

      "abstract": "Traffic sign detection is a critical task in the operation of Autonomous Vehicles (AV), as it ensures the safety of all road users. Current DNN-based sign classification systems rely on pixel-level features to detect traffic signs and can be susceptible to adversarial attacks. These attacks involve small, imperceptible changes to a sign that can cause traditional classifiers to misidentify the sign. We propose an Inductive Logic Programming (ILP) based approach for stop sign detection in AVs to address this issue. This method utilises high-level features of a sign, such as its shape, colour, and text, to detect categories of traffic signs. This approach is more robust against adversarial attacks, as it mimics human-like perception and is less susceptible to the limitations of current DNN classifiers. We consider two adversarial attacking methods to evaluate our approach: Robust Physical Perturbation (PR2) and Adversarial Camouflage (AdvCam). These attacks are able to deceive DNN classifiers, causing them to misidentify stop signs as other signs with high confidence. The results show that the proposed ILP-based technique is able to correctly identify all targeted stop signs, even in the presence of PR2 and ADvCam attacks. The proposed learning method is also efficient as it requires minimal training data. Moreover, it is fully explainable, making it possible to debug AVs.",

      "abstract": "Background: Late gadolinium enhancement (LGE) cardiovascular magnetic resonance (CMR) imaging is the gold standard for non-invasive myocardial tissue characterisation. However, accurate segmentation of the left ventricular (LV) myocardium remains a challenge due to limited training data and lack of quality control. This study addresses these issues by leveraging generative adversarial networks (GAN)-generated virtual native enhancement (VNE) images to expand the training set and incorporating an automated quality control-driven (QCD) framework to improve segmentation reliability. Methods: A dataset comprising 4,716 LGE images (from 1,363 patients with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy and myocardial infarction) was used for development. To generate additional clinically validated data, LGE data were augmented with a GAN-based generator to produce VNE images. LV was contoured on these images manually by clinical observers. To create diverse candidate segmentations, the QCD framework involved multiple U-Nets, which were combined using statistical rank filters. The framework predicted the Dice Similarity Coefficient (DSC) for each candidate segmentation, with the highest predicted DSC indicating the most accurate and reliable result. The performance of the QCD ensemble framework was evaluated on both LGE and VNE test datasets (309 LGE/VNE images from 103 patients), assessing segmentation accuracy (DSC) and quality prediction (mean absolute error (MAE) and binary classification accuracy). Results: The QCD framework effectively and rapidly segmented the LV myocardium (< 1 second per image) on both LGE and VNE images, demonstrating robust performance on both test datasets with similar mean DSC (LGE: 0.845 \u00b1 0.075; VNE: 0.845 \u00b1 0.071; p=ns). Incorporating GAN-generated VNE data into the training process consistently led to enhanced performance for both individual models and the overall framework. The quality control mechanism yielded a high performance (MAE=0.043, accuracy=0.951) emphasising the accuracy of the quality control-driven strategy in predicting segmentation quality in clinical settings. Overall, no statistical difference (p=ns) was found when comparing the LGE and VNE test sets across all experiments. Conclusion: The QCD ensemble framework, leveraging GAN-generated VNE data and an automated quality control mechanism, significantly improved the accuracy and reliability of LGE segmentation, paving the way for enhanced and accountable diagnostic imaging in routine clinical use.",

      "abstract": "Recently, unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) have gained significant popularity and have been extensively utilized in wireless communications. Due to the susceptibility of wireless channels to eavesdropping, interference and other security attacks, UAV communication security faces serious challenges. Therefore, novel solutions need to be investigated for handling corresponding issues. Note that the UAV with full-duplex (FD) mode can actively improve spectral efficiency, and reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS) can enable the intelligent control of signal reflection for improving transmission quality. Accordingly, the security of UAV communications may be considerably improved by combining the two techniques mentioned above. In this paper, we investigate the performance of secure communication in urban areas, assisted by a FD UAV and an RIS, where the UAV receives sensitive information from the ground users and sends jamming signals to the ground eavesdroppers. Particularly, we propose an approach to jointly optimize the user scheduling, user transmit power, UAV jamming power, RIS phase shift, and UAV trajectory for maximizing the worst-case secrecy rate. However, the non-convexity of the problem makes it difficult to solve. Combining alternating optimization (AO), slack variable techniques, successive convex approximation (SCA), and semi-definite relaxation (SDR), we propose an effective algorithm to obtain a suboptimal solution. According to the simulation results, in contrast to other benchmark schemes, we show that our proposed algorithm can significantly improve the overall secrecy rate.",

      "abstract": "Future wireless networks are expected to provide ubiquitous connectivity to a wide range of devices with varying traffic patterns, wherever and whenever it is required. Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) are also considered a potential technique for accommodating massive connections and providing seamless coverage. They can be used as flying base stations (BSs) to take advantage of line-of-sight (LoS) connections and effectively support wireless communication coverage and throughput for 5G and beyond. However, the use of highly mobile and energy-constrained UAVs for wireless communications brings plenty of new challenges. 5G wireless networks require non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) to be able to meet heterogeneous requirements for low latency, high dependability, massive connection, better fairness, and high throughput. This paper presents an overview of NOMA-based UAV enabled communications by introducing the background of UAV communication and NOMA schemes. Power allocation schemes are also explored as they are critical controlling mechanisms for performance optimization of NOMA-UAV systems. We also categorize UAV-enabled communication applications for usage in both routine professional settings and emergency scenarios. Finally, we address several open research questions that need to be solved for NOMA, as well as new opportunities and future research trends to be exploited.",

      "abstract": "Deploying multiple robots for target search and tracking has many practical applications, yet the challenge of planning over unknown or partially known targets remains difficult to address. With recent advances in deep learning, intelligent control techniques such as reinforcement learning have enabled agents to learn autonomously from environment interactions with little to no prior knowledge. Such methods can address the exploration-exploitation tradeoff of planning over unknown targets in a data-driven manner, streamlining the decision-making pipeline with end-to-end training. In this paper, we propose a multi-agent reinforcement learning technique (MARL) with target map building based on distributed Gaussian process (GP). We leverage the distributed GP to encode belief over the target locations in a scalable manner and incorporate it into centralized training with decentralized execution MARL framework to efficiently plan over unknown targets. We evaluate the performance and transferability of the trained policy in simulation and demonstrate the method on a swarm of micro unmanned aerial vehicles with hardware experiments.",

      "abstract": "Unmanned aerial vehicles have found applications in fields such as environmental monitoring and the military. Although the collected data in some of these application domains are sensitive, public channels are deployed during the communication process. Therefore, many protocols have been presented to preserve the confidentiality and integrity of the exchanged messages. However, numerous security and performance challenges have been noted in the majority of these protocols. In this paper, an elliptic curve cryptography (ECC) and symmetric key-based protocol is presented. The choice of ECC was informed by its relatively shorter key sizes compared to other asymmetric encryption algorithms such as the Rivest\u2013Shamir\u2013Adleman (RSA) algorithm. Security analysis showed that this protocol provides mutual authentication, session key agreement, untraceability, anonymity, forward key secrecy, backward key secrecy, and biometric privacy. In addition, it is robust against smart card loss, password guessing, known secret session temporary information (KSSTI), privileged insider, side-channeling, impersonation, denial-of-service (DoS), and man-in-the-middle (MitM) attacks. The comparative performance evaluation showed that it has relatively low computation, storage, and communication complexities.",

      "abstract": "In today\u2019s world the technology has got boomed up to the peak. So as a measure of this technology peak we could see that the enhancement of this has raised very large. This technology booming has also impacted health care sector. In our paper we are going to discuss much on implantable medical devices and its uses which plays a major role in patient\u2019s life. This IMD\u2019s are going to be the life changing aspect of each and every patient. These devices are highly controlled IoT devices (i.e.) those devices are connected through internet which will help doctors to track the details of the patients remotely. On the other hand since all these devices are connected to internet, these are easily hacked by the hackers. The factors of how those devices are much vulnerable and what are all the threats that will make these devices to malfunction and lead a problem to the patients is discussed. And also this will lead the health sector to fall in their reputation. IMD\u2019s are of many types which are in existing in the Medical industry. But we are going to consider some IMD\u2019s as example and we have planned to make a detailed study on the problems on those devices. All these devices are vulnerable since it is connected to internet. So our aim is to completely or partially reduce the risks on those devices via communication network. We have also showcased the possible threats and vulnerabilities chances on those devices. The main scenarios of device control issues and possible solutions have been discussed in this article.",

      "abstract": "Autonomous vehicles (AVs), defined as vehicles capable of navigation and decision-making independent of human intervention, represent a revolutionary advancement in transportation technology. These vehicles operate by synthesizing an array of sophisticated technologies, including sensors, cameras, GPS, radar, light imaging detection and ranging (LiDAR), and advanced computing systems. These components work in concert to accurately perceive the vehicle\u2019s environment, ensuring the capacity to make optimal decisions in real-time. At the heart of AV functionality lies the ability to facilitate intercommunication between vehicles and with critical road infrastructure\u2014a characteristic that, while central to their efficacy, also renders them susceptible to cyber threats. The potential infiltration of these communication channels poses a severe threat, enabling the possibility of personal information theft or the introduction of malicious software that could compromise vehicle safety. This paper offers a comprehensive exploration of the current state of AV technology, particularly examining the intersection of autonomous vehicles and emotional intelligence. We delve into an extensive analysis of recent research on safety lapses and security vulnerabilities in autonomous vehicles, placing specific emphasis on the different types of cyber attacks to which they are susceptible. We further explore the various security solutions that have been proposed and implemented to address these threats. The discussion not only provides an overview of the existing challenges but also presents a pathway toward future research directions. This includes potential advancements in the AV field, the continued refinement of safety measures, and the development of more robust, resilient security mechanisms. Ultimately, this paper seeks to contribute to a deeper understanding of the safety and security landscape of autonomous vehicles, fostering discourse on the intricate balance between technological advancement and security in this rapidly evolving field.",

      "abstract": "The rapid increase in the number of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) poses a threat to the safety of personnel, ground facilities, and aircraft. Therefore, as the basis of UAV safety protection, requirements on collision avoidance technology are getting higher in the mean time. Although plenty of research on UAV collision avoidance systems and methods exists, there is still a lack of integrated view of the UAV safety in the current civil airspace. The reason behind this is that the collision avoidance is always treated as a simple and basic behavior of autonomous robots, wherein a UAV is considered not so much different from other unmanned moving vehicles except its dynamic model. Regulations and rules that are specific to the UAVs under the background of airspace safety are not emphasized and put into consideration in the system and method design. This review paper serves as a guide for developing the UAV collision avoidance technology by summarizing the existing regulations and rules related to UAV collision avoidance, discussing the mathematical formulation of the rule-based collision avoidance methods, and testing and benchmarking those methods.",

      "abstract": "The ability of airships to fly in hover is a major plus of this category of flying vehicles. However, especially for the case of autonomous flight, this feature can be exploited only recurring to a carefully designed layout of the thrusters on board. Furthermore, the thrusters need to be suitably governed by a dedicated control algorithm. This paper explores a scheme for the control in hover of a thrust-controlled airship without thrust vector control, also assessing its effectiveness in near-hover positioning problems. The control scheme proposed herein extends the capability of a stability augmentation and guidance controller for forward flight, previously introduced by the authors for a conceptually similar airship. A control action based on a system of thrust forces required for hover, and additional thrust components for stabilizing and steering the airship in slow (near-hover) navigation, is thoroughly described. The ensuing control suite is applied and tested in the present paper on the high-fidelity virtual model of a five-thruster airship, showing reasonable stability levels and navigation accuracy of the controlled system.",

      "abstract": "Due to its flexibility, cost-effectiveness, and quick deployment abilities, unmanned aerial vehicle-mounted base station (UmBS) deployment is a promising approach for restoring wireless services in areas devastated by natural disasters such as floods, thunderstorms, and tsunami strikes. However, the biggest challenges in the deployment process of UmBS are ground user equipment\u2019s (UE\u2019s) position information, UmBS transmit power optimization, and UE-UmBS association. In this article, we propose Localization of ground UEs and their Association with the UmBS (LUAU), an approach that ensures localization of ground UEs and energy-efficient deployment of UmBSs. Unlike existing studies that proposed their work based on the known UEs positional information, we first propose a three-dimensional range-based localization approach (3D-RBL) to estimate the position information of the ground UEs. Subsequently, an optimization problem is formulated to maximize the UE\u2019s mean data rate by optimizing the UmBS transmit power and deployment locations while taking the interference from the surrounding UmBSs into consideration. To achieve the goal of the optimization problem, we utilize the exploration and exploitation abilities of the Q-learning framework. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed approach outperforms two benchmark schemes in terms of the UE\u2019s mean data rate and outage percentage.",

      "abstract": "A few characteristics of advanced commercial drones have attracted increasing attention in recent years. Because of their ability to carry payloads bypassing ground security, there is a greater possibility of small drones being exploited for illegitimate operations. The drone tracking and surveillance is critical to prevent security breaches like these. Small drones and birds have similar appearances in complicated backgrounds and make it difficult to recognize drone in surveillance videos. Manual surveillance and drone detection are very complicated and tedious process. Therefore, an automated method is required to distinguish between drone and birds. In this paper, focus measure operators (FMOs)-based method is developed for drone detection. The five FMO parameters are computed on each frame of every video. Feature ranking is done to identify the significant feature for drone identification followed by classification which is performed using random forest classifier. Efficacy of the proposed method is evaluated on Drone-vs-Bird Detection Challenge at IEEE AVSS2021 dataset which is provided by Workshop on Small-Drone Surveillance, Detection and Counteraction Techniques (WOSDETC) supported by the SafeShore Consortium. The proposed method achieved average accuracy 94.15% with sensitivity 96.69% for identifying drones with drone present (DP) versus neither drone nor bird present (NDNBP) (two class), accuracy 93.60% with sensitivity 96.20% DP versus both bird and drone present (BBDP) versus NDNBP (three class), accuracy 92% with sensitivity 95% DP versus bird present versus BBDP versus NDNBP (four class) for moving camera recordings. Average accuracy for two class, three class, and four class classification system with moving as well as stationary camera is 95.18%, 93.20%, and 94%, respectively, which are significantly high and can be utilized for drone identification.",

      "abstract": "The capacity for autonomous functionality serves as the fundamental ability and driving force for the cross-generational upgrading of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs). With the disruptive transformation of artificial intelligence technology, autonomous trajectory planning based on intelligent algorithms has emerged as a key technique for enhancing UAVs\u2019 capacity for autonomous behavior, thus holding significant research value. To address the challenges of UAV trajectory planning in complex 3D environments, this paper proposes a multi-UAV cooperative trajectory-planning method based on a Modified Cheetah Optimization (MCO) algorithm. Firstly, a spatiotemporal cooperative trajectory planning model is established, incorporating UAV-cooperative constraints and performance constraints. Evaluation criteria, including fuel consumption, altitude, and threat distribution field cost functions, are introduced. Then, based on its parent Cheetah Optimization (CO) algorithm, the MCO algorithm incorporates a logistic chaotic mapping strategy and an adaptive search agent strategy, thereby improving the home-returning mechanism. Finally, extensive simulation experiments are conducted using a considerably large test dataset containing functions with the following four characteristics: unimodal, multimodal, separable, and inseparable. Meanwhile, a strategy for dimensionality reduction searching is employed to solve the problem of autonomous trajectory planning in real-world scenarios. The results of a conducted simulation demonstrate that the MCO algorithm outperforms several other related algorithms, showcasing smaller trajectory costs, a faster convergence speed, and stabler performance. The proposed algorithm exhibits a certain degree of correctness, effectiveness, and advancement in solving the problem of multi-UAV cooperative trajectory planning.",

      "abstract": "Identifying potentially life-threatening diseases is a key challenge for emergency medical services. This study aims at examining the role of different prehospital biomarkers from point-of-care testing to derive and validate a score to detect 2-day in-hospital mortality. We conducted a prospective, observational, prehospital, ongoing, and derivation\u2014validation study in three Spanish provinces, in adults evacuated by ambulance and admitted to the emergency department. A total of 23 ambulance-based biomarkers were collected from each patient. A biomarker score based on logistic regression was fitted to predict 2-day mortality from an optimum subset of variables from prehospital blood analysis, obtained through an automated feature selection stage. 2806 cases were analyzed, with a median age of 68 (interquartile range 51\u201381), 42.3% of women, and a 2-day mortality rate of 5.5% (154 non-survivors). The blood biomarker score was constituted by the partial pressure of carbon dioxide, lactate, and creatinine. The score fitted with logistic regression using these biomarkers reached a high performance to predict 2-day mortality, with an AUC of 0.933 (95% CI 0.841\u20130.973). The following risk levels for 2-day mortality were identified from the score: low risk (score\u2009&lt;\u20091), where only 8.2% of non-survivors were assigned to; medium risk (1\u2009\u2264\u2009score\u2009&lt;\u20094); and high risk (score\u2009\u2265\u20094), where the 2-day mortality rate was 57.6%. The novel blood biomarker score provides an excellent association with 2-day in-hospital mortality, as well as real-time feedback on the metabolic-respiratory patient status. Thus, this score can help in the decision-making process at critical moments in life-threatening situations.",

      "abstract": "The employment of drone strikes has been ongoing and the public continues to debate their perceived benefits. A question that persists is whether drone strikes contribute to an increase in radicalization. This paper presents a data-driven approach to explore the relationship between drone strikes conducted in Pakistan and subsequent responses, often in the form of terrorist attacks carried out by those in the communities targeted by these particular counterterrorism measures. Our exploration and analysis of news reports which discussed drone strikes and radicalization suggest that government-sanctioned drone strikes in Pakistan appear to drive terrorist events with a distributed lag that can be determined analytically. We leverage news reports to inform and calibrate an agent-based model grounded in radicalization and opinion dynamics theory. This enabled us to simulate terrorist attacks that approximated the rate and magnitude observed in Pakistan from 2007 through 2018. We argue that this research effort advances the field of radicalization and lays the foundation for further work in the area of data-driven modeling and drone strikes.",

      "abstract": "Endovascular intervention is the state-of-the-art treatment for common cardiovascular diseases, such as heart attack and stroke. Automation of the procedure may improve the working conditions of physicians and provide high-quality care to patients in remote areas, posing a major impact on overall treatment quality. However, this requires the adaption to individual patient anatomies, which currently poses an unsolved challenge. This work investigates an endovascular guidewire controller architecture based on recurrent neural networks. The controller is evaluated in-silico on its ability to adapt to new vessel geometries when navigating through the aortic arch. The controller\u2019s generalization capabilities are examined by reducing the number of variations seen during training. For this purpose, an endovascular simulation environment is introduced, which allows guidewire navigation in a parametrizable aortic arch. The recurrent controller achieves a higher navigation success rate of 75.0% after 29,200 interventions compared to 71.6% after 156,800 interventions for a feedforward controller. Furthermore, the recurrent controller generalizes to previously unseen aortic arches and is robust towards size changes of the aortic arch. Being trained on 2048 aortic arch geometries gives the same results as being trained with full variation when evaluated on 1000 different geometries. For interpolation a gap of 30% of the scaling range and for extrapolation additional 10% of the scaling range can be navigated successfully. Adaption to new vessel geometries is essential in the navigation of endovascular instruments. Therefore, the intrinsic generalization to new vessel geometries poses an essential step towards autonomous endovascular robotics.",

      "abstract": "Connected and Autonomous Vehicles (CAVs) expect to dramatically improve road safety and efficiency of the transportation system. However, CAVs can be vulnerable to attacks at different levels, e.g., attacks on intra-vehicle networks and inter-vehicle networks. Those malicious attacks not only result in loss of confidentiality and user privacy but also lead to more serious consequences such as bodily injury and loss of life. An intrusion detection system (IDS) is one of the most effective ways to monitor the operations of vehicles and networks, detect different types of attacks, and provide essential information to mitigate and remedy the effects of attacks. To ensure the safety of CAVs, it is extremely important to detect various attacks accurately in a timely fashion. The purpose of this survey is to provide a comprehensive review of available machine learning (ML) based IDS for intra-vehicle and inter-vehicle networks. Additionally, this paper discusses publicly available datasets for CAV and offers a summary of the many current testbeds and future research trends for connected vehicle environments.",

      "abstract": "An emergency risk assessment by collecting disaster-affected images via unmanned aerial vehicles is the current norm. Reasonable rescue planning and resource allocation depend on a quick and precise semantic interpretation of natural disaster images. However, the poor image quality produced by various technological and environmental factors and complex scenarios associated with disaster-affected regions makes the classification operation challenging. In order to get in-depth spatial features for decoding the intricate textures associated with catastrophe images, this study proposes an implementation of the CNN-based multibranch feature extraction technique. An advanced mixed-attention mechanism is exploited to extract the highly essential features. This mixed-attention mechanism effectively overcomes the flaws generated by traditional convolution by neglecting the global information and focusing on local key features. An SRGAN-based super-resolution method is utilized to acquire high-resolution images with rich spatial details to enhance the quality of aerial images. Besides, we experiment with several existing image classification algorithms, such as the ensemble model of pre-trained networks, the capsule network model, and the stacked autoencoder. Finally, we perform a comparative analysis between all the deployed models to obtain the best-performing classifier. Our proposed multibranch feature extraction with mixed-attention mechanism-based network performs more superiorly among the four models due to its ability to extract highly relevant features from disaster images. Generated super-resolution images effectively increase the classification performance. Our research findings and approaches accommodate quality resources for disaster image quality enhancement and classification activities.",

      "abstract": "The market for unmanned aerial systems (UASs) has grown considerably worldwide, but their ability to transmit sensitive information poses a threat to public safety. To counter these threats, authorities, and anti-drone organizations are ensuring that UASs comply with regulations, focusing on strategies to mitigate the risks associated with malicious drones. This study presents a technique for detecting drone models using identification (ID) tags in radio frequency (RF) signals, enabling the extraction of real-time telemetry data through the decoding of Drone ID packets. The system, implemented with a development board, facilitates efficient drone tracking. The results of a measurement campaign performance evaluation include maximum detection distances of 1.3 km for the Mavic Air, 1.5 km for the Mavic 3, and 3.7 km for the Mavic 2 Pro. The system accurately estimates a drone\u2019s 2D position, altitude, and speed in real time. Thanks to the decoding of telemetry packets, the system demonstrates promising accuracy, with worst-case distances between estimated and actual drone positions of 35 m for the Mavic 2 Pro, 17 m for the Mavic Air, and 15 m for the Mavic 3. In addition, there is a relative error of 14% for altitude measurements and 7% for speed measurements. The reaction times calculated to secure a vulnerable site within a 200 m radius are 1.83 min (Mavic Air), 1.03 min (Mavic 3), and 2.92 min (Mavic 2 Pro). This system is proving effective in addressing emerging concerns about drone-related threats, helping to improve public safety and security.",

      "abstract": "Neural networks have proven to be very powerful at computer vision tasks. However, they often exhibit unexpected behaviors, acting against background knowledge about the problem at hand. This calls for models (i) able to learn from requirements expressing such background knowledge, and (ii) guaranteed to be compliant with the requirements themselves. Unfortunately, the development of such models is hampered by the lack of real-world datasets equipped with formally specified requirements. In this paper, we introduce the ROad event Awareness Dataset with logical Requirements (ROAD-R), the first publicly available dataset for autonomous driving with requirements expressed as logical constraints. Given ROAD-R, we show that current state-of-the-art models often violate its logical constraints, and that it is possible to exploit them to create models that (i) have a better performance, and (ii) are guaranteed to be compliant with the requirements themselves.",

      "abstract": "Endurance is a critical factor for solar-powered unmanned aerial vehicles (SUAVs). Taking inspiration from birds, SUAVs have the ability to harvest extra energy from atmospheric thermal updrafts to extend their endurance. Though recent research has mainly focused on estimating the characteristics of thermal updrafts, there is a noticeable dearth of studies investigating the energy performance of SUAVs during soaring under different conditions. To begin with, this work establishes a thermal updraft and SUAV energy model. In addition, it introduces an integrated guidance and control process to achieve static soaring within thermal for SUAVs. Numerical simulations are implemented to analyze the electric energy performance at different solar irradiation levels, SUAV velocities and thermal strengths. Several remarkable conclusions are drawn from the simulations, which could provide significant insights for SUAVs to further exploit thermal energy.",

      "abstract": "Aims: The differentiation of left ventricular (LV) hypertrophic phenotypes is challenging in patients with normal ejection fraction (EF). The myocardial contraction fraction (MCF) is a simple dimensionless index useful for specifically identifying cardiac amyloidosis (CA) and hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) when calculated by cardiac magnetic resonance. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the value of MCF measured by three-dimensional automated, machine-learning-based LV chamber metrics (dynamic heart model [DHM]) for the discrimination of different forms of hypertrophic phenotypes. Methods and Results: We analyzed the DHM LV metrics of patients with CA (n = 10), hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM, n = 36), isolated hypertension (IH, n = 87), and 54 healthy controls. MCF was calculated by dividing LV stroke volume by LV myocardial volume. Compared with controls (median 61.95%, interquartile range 55.43\u201367.79%), mean values for MCF were significantly reduced in HCM\u201448.55% (43.46\u201354.86% p < 0.001)\u2014and CA\u201440.92% (36.68\u201346.84% p < 0.002)\u2014but not in IH\u201459.35% (53.22\u201364.93% p < 0.7). MCF showed a weak correlation with EF in the overall cohort (R2 = 0.136) and the four study subgroups (healthy adults, R2 = 0.039 IH, R2 = 0.089; HCM, R2 = 0.225; CA, R2 = 0.102). ROC analyses showed that MCF could differentiate between healthy adults and HCM (sensitivity 75.9%, specificity 77.8%, AUC 0.814) and between healthy adults and CA (sensitivity 87.0%, specificity 100%, AUC 0.959). The best cut-off values were 55.3% and 52.8%. Conclusions: The easily derived quantification of MCF by DHM can refine our echocardiographic discrimination capacity in patients with hypertrophic phenotype and normal EF. It should be added to the diagnostic workup of these patients.",

      "abstract": "Sea level rise (SLR) poses a significant threat to shorelines and the environment in terms of flooding densely populated areas and associated coastal ecosystems. Scenario analysis is often used to investigate potential SLR consequences, which can help stakeholders make informed decisions on climate change mitigation policies or guidelines. However, SLR scenario analysis requires considerable geospatial data analytics and repetitive execution of SLR models for alternative scenarios. Having to run SLR models many times for scenario analysis studies leads to heavy computational needs as well as a large investment of time and effort. This study explores the benefits of incorporating cyberinfrastructure technologies, represented by scientific workflows and high-performance computing, into spatially explicit SLR modeling. We propose a scientific workflow-driven approach to modeling the potential loss of marshland in response to different SLR scenarios. Our study area is the central South Carolina coastal region, USA. The scientific workflow approach allows for automating the geospatial data processing for SLR modeling, while repetitive modeling and data analytics are accelerated by leveraging high-performance and parallel computing. With support from automation and acceleration, this scientific workflow-driven approach allows us to conduct computationally intensive scenario analysis experiments to evaluate the impact of SLR on alternative land cover types including marshes and tidal flats as well as their spatial characteristics.",

      "abstract": "Cooperative spectrum sensing (CSS) involves multiple secondary users (SUs) reporting primary user (PU) channel sensing states to the fusion center (FC). However, the high overheads associated with multi-user CSS impose power limitations that limit its usefulness in unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) networks. To address this challenge, we propose a virtual CSS, where a single UAV conducts CSS while following a circular flight trajectory in the air. The novelty of our approach is presenting a working frame structure for the UAV flight, including sensing and data transmission periods with further division of the sensing time into mini-sensing slots. In the virtual CSS, UAV performs local sensing decisions in each mini-slot and accumulates them for a final decision. The proposed virtual CSS scheme exploits sequential decision fusion (SDF), which sequentially adds individual mini-slot decisions. Additionally, we leverage machine learning (ML), employing AdaBoost ensembling classifier (ENC), to inspect flight conditions and reconfigure mini-slot periods dynamically for both traditional decision fusion (TDF) and our proposed SDF schemes. Furthermore, we identify an optimal decision threshold (ODT) for the proposed SDF, enabling the comparison of sequential results with an adjustable threshold through majority voting. This novel approach results in energy efficiency and improved throughput for virtual CSS using SDF, surpassing the performance of TDF, which relies on collecting entire mini-slot reports for its final decision. Simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed SDF following the ENCODT (SDF-ENCODT) scheme compared to existing techniques from the literature. We explore varying levels of UAV flight velocities, moving radius, detection probability demand, and channel signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), reinforcing the significance of our contribution. Our research highlights the motivation to address spectrum scarcity in UAV communication by proposing an innovative virtual CSS scheme based on SDF. The proposed approach enhances spectrum utilization, overcomes power limitations, and substantially improves CSS for UAV networks.",

      "abstract": "Automated guided vehicles undertake complex transportation tasks, for instance, in production and storage systems. In recent years, an increased focus on sustainability has occurred as the effects of ongoing climate change have become more apparent. Engineers are searching intensively for ways to design technical systems that are not only environmentally sustainable, but are also resilient to the challenges of the changing climate and other environmental conditions. The production of automated guided vehicles requires considerable resources; therefore, a long operation time is desirable for overall sustainability. The performance of transportation tasks requires certain processes, such as control, path planning, coordination/synchronization, and maintenance and update processes\u2014the latter are also very important for a long operation time. This article proposes understanding these processes as services and to explore product service systems with automated guided vehicles. Due to their complexity, the efficient and safe operation of such systems can be at risk because of several factors, such as component faults, external attacks and disturbances. For several years both resilient control and resilience engineering have been researched as possible remedies. An extension of these two concepts to the early stages of system development processes and including the system\u2019s hardware is proposed in this article. This extension is referred to as resilient design. A primary purpose of resilient design is sustainability through extended usability and planned updates. The main intention of this article is to provide a comprehensive understanding of resilient design through application to product service systems with automated guided vehicles. The basis for this contribution is an extensive literature review and detailed system analyses on different levels. The main research results include novel application modes for product development methods. The explanation of the results is supported by means of an illustrative example based on a product service system with automated guided vehicles.",

      "abstract": "To address the challenge of coordinated combat involving multiple UAVs in reconnaissance and search attacks, we propose the Multi-UAV Distributed Self-Organizing Cooperative Intelligence Surveillance and Combat (CISCS) strategy. This strategy employs distributed control to overcome issues associated with centralized control and communication difficulties. Additionally, it introduces a time-constrained formation controller to address the problem of unstable multi-UAV formations and lengthy formation times. Furthermore, a multi-task allocation algorithm is designed to tackle the issue of allocating multiple tasks to individual UAVs, enabling autonomous decision-making at the local level. The distributed self-organized multi-UAV cooperative reconnaissance and combat strategy consists of three main components. Firstly, a multi-UAV finite time formation controller allows for the rapid formation of a mission-specific formation in a finite period. Secondly, a multi-task goal assignment module generates a task sequence for each UAV, utilizing an improved distributed Ant Colony Optimization (ACO) algorithm based on Q-Learning. This module also incorporates a colony disorientation strategy to expand the search range and a search transition strategy to prevent premature convergence of the algorithm. Lastly, a UAV obstacle avoidance module considers internal collisions and provides real-time obstacle avoidance paths for multiple UAVs. In the first part, we propose a formation algorithm in finite time to enable the quick formation of multiple UAVs in a three-dimensional space. In the second part, an improved distributed ACO algorithm based on Q-Learning is introduced for task allocation and generation of task sequences. This module includes a colony disorientation strategy to expand the search range and a search transition strategy to avoid premature convergence. In the third part, a multi-task target assignment module is presented to generate task sequences for each UAV, considering internal collisions. This module provides real-time obstacle avoidance paths for multiple UAVs, preventing premature convergence of the algorithm. Finally, we verify the practicality and reliability of the strategy through simulations.",

      "abstract": "Recent studies have shown that deep-learning-based models for processing Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) remote sensing images are vulnerable to artificially designed adversarial examples, which can lead to incorrect predictions of deep models when facing adversarial examples. Previous adversarial attack methods have mainly focused on the classification and detection of UAV remote sensing images, and there is still a lack of research on adversarial attacks for object tracking in UAV video. To address this challenge, we propose an attention-enhanced one-shot adversarial attack method for UAV remote sensing object tracking, which perturbs only the template frame and generates adversarial samples offline. First, we employ an attention feature loss to make the original frame\u2019s features dissimilar to those of the adversarial frame, and an attention confidence loss to either suppress or enhance different confidence scores. Additionally, by forcing the tracker to concentrate on the background information near the target, a background distraction loss is used to mismatch templates with subsequent frames. Finally, we add total variation loss to generate adversarial examples that appear natural to humans. We validate the effectiveness of our method against popular trackers such as SiamRPN, DaSiamRPN, and SiamRPN++ on the UAV123 remote sensing dataset. Experimental results verify the superior attack performance of our proposed method.",

      "abstract": "We address the route planning problem of an unmanned air vehicle (UAV) that operates in a two-dimensional hostile terrain monitored with radars. In this terrain, there are a number of targets that are planned to be visited to collect intelligence. We consider a setting where a UAV starts from a base, visits the targets, and returns to the base. Targets may move during the UAV\u2019s mission and their movement directions are unpredictable in advance. We consider two objectives: to minimize distance and to minimize radar detection threat. These objectives are conflicting in the regions monitored by radars. The constructed routes comprise the visiting order to the targets and the trajectories used between the visited pairs of targets. There are many efficient trajectories between the target pairs and many efficient visiting orders of the targets due to the two conflicting objectives. As a result, there are many efficient routes that are combinations of efficient trajectories and efficient orders of visits. Due to the dynamic nature of the problem, there is a need to select the route to follow in real time. To respond to these challenges, we develop an algorithm that finds a preferred route of a route planner (RP) quickly. We characterize the efficient trajectories between target pairs approximately and utilize the RP\u2019s preferences to choose the preferred efficient trajectories and to construct a preferred route. During the flight of the UAV, targets keep moving. We update the route every time the UAV reaches a new target. We also develop a heuristic approach in case the problem needs to be solved faster. We demonstrate our algorithms on 5, 9, and 15-target problems.",

      "abstract": "Z-shaped folding wings have the potential to enhance the flight performance of an aircraft, contingent upon its mission requirements. However, the current scope of research on unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) with Z-shaped folding wings primarily focuses on the analysis of their folding structure and aeroelasticity-related vibrations. Computational fluid dynamics methods and dynamic meshing are employed to examine the folding process of Z-shaped folding wings. By comparing the steady aerodynamic characteristics of Z-shaped folding wings with those of conventional wings, this investigation explores the dynamic aerodynamic properties of Z-shaped folding wings at varying upward folding speeds. The numerical findings reveal that the folding of Z-shaped folding wings reduces the lift-to-drag ratio, yet simultaneously diminishes the nose-down pitching moment, thereby augmenting maneuverability. Concerning unsteady aerodynamics, the transient lift and drag coefficients of the folded wing initially increase and subsequently decrease as the folding angle increases at small angles of attack. Likewise, the nose-down pitching moment exhibits the same pattern in response to the folding angle. Additionally, the aerodynamic coefficients experience a slight decrease during the initial half of the folding process with increasing folding speed. Once the wing reaches approximately 40\u00b0~45\u00b0 of folding, there is an abrupt change in the transient aerodynamic coefficients. Notably, this abrupt change is delayed with higher folding speeds, eventually converging to similar values across different folding speeds.",

      "abstract": "The mapped mathematical models (MMMs) in machine learning are instrumental in obtaining segregated yet effective solutions for security-specific scenarios in intrusion detection systems (IDSs). Utilizing machine learning approaches amplifies the achievable security desired for communication among nodes constituting the IoT networks. The myriad of attacks threatening security and hindering advanced communication in IoT networks need capable ML approaches for detection. The bagging and boosting (B &amp; B) algorithms minimize VBN (variance, noise, bias) derived errors for the amelioration of stability and accuracy of ML approaches and greatly aid in the detection of malicious nodes while segregating attributes which chiefly contributes to the prediction of attacks occurring in the network which later provide for establishing threshold values and determination of important metrics affected during attacks. The internet of vehicles requires security monitoring and analysis for the attainment of secure vehicular communication by avoiding on-road accidental risks and ensuring on-road timeliness. The increasing population with the boom in traffic highlights the imminence of studies on intelligent transportation networks (ITNs). The study targets to improve the efficiency of machine learning frameworks for future use in ITNs by utilizing powerful techniques in the pre-processing stage for optimized performance in different attack scenarios. Subsequently, it compares the obtained metrics for finding the most suitable B &amp; B algorithm for future studies. In the study, we first present the taxonomy of attacks analyzed and then concisely describe the working principles of B &amp; B algorithms for improved, secure communication in IoTs. Additionally, it involves the analysis of existent internet of vehicles (IoV) architectures, preceding the B &amp; B algorithms applied on various datasets, that were analyzed through dataset pre-processing and attribute description. Finally, results were analyzed using the different B &amp; B algorithms for intrusion detection systems (IDSs) to find the most suitable algorithm.",

      "abstract": "Hyperspectral sensors mounted on unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV) offer the prospect of high-resolution multi-temporal spectral analysis for a range of remote-sensing applications. However, although accurate onboard navigation sensors track the moment-to-moment pose of the UAV in flight, geometric distortions are introduced into the scanned data sets. Consequently, considerable time-consuming (user/manual) post-processing rectification effort is generally required to retrieve geometrically accurate mosaics of the hyperspectral data cubes. Moreover, due to the line-scan nature of many hyperspectral sensors and their intrinsic inability to exploit structure from motion (SfM), only 2D mosaics are generally created. To address this, we propose a fast, automated and computationally robust georectification and mosaicking technique that generates 3D hyperspectral point clouds. The technique first morphologically and geometrically examines (and, if possible, repairs) poorly constructed individual hyperspectral cubes before aligning these cubes into swaths. The luminance of each individual cube is estimated and normalised, prior to being integrated into a swath of images. The hyperspectral swaths are co-registered to a targeted element of a luminance-normalised orthomosaic obtained using a standard red\u2013green\u2013blue (RGB) camera and SfM. To avoid computationally intensive image processing operations such as 2D convolutions, key elements of the orthomosaic are identified using pixel masks, pixel index manipulation and nearest neighbour searches. Maximally stable extremal regions (MSER) and speeded-up robust feature (SURF) extraction are then combined with maximum likelihood sample consensus (MLESAC) feature matching to generate the best geometric transformation model for each swath. This geometrically transforms and merges individual pushbroom scanlines into a single spatially continuous hyperspectral mosaic; and this georectified 2D hyperspectral mosaic is then converted into a 3D hyperspectral point cloud by aligning the hyperspectral mosaic with the RGB point cloud used to create the orthomosaic obtained using SfM. A high spatial accuracy is demonstrated. Hyperspectral mosaics with a 5 cm spatial resolution were mosaicked with root mean square positional accuracies of 0.42 m. The technique was tested on five scenes comprising two types of landscape. The entire process, which is coded in MATLAB, takes around twenty minutes to process data sets covering around 30 Ha at a 5 cm resolution on a laptop with 32 GB RAM and an Intel\u00ae Core i7-8850H CPU running at 2.60 GHz.",

      "abstract": "With the rapid advancement of Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) technology, UAV swarms are being extensively applied in various fields, such as intelligent transportation, search and rescue, logistics delivery, and aerial mapping. However, the utilization of UAV swarms in sustainable transportation also presents some challenges, such as inefficient task allocation and data transmission security issues, highlighting the importance of privacy protection in this context. To address these issues, this study applies blockchain technology to multi-UAV tasks and proposes a blockchain-based multi-UAV task processing system for situation awareness and real-time decisions. The primary objective of this system is to enhance the efficiency of UAV swarm task scheduling, bolster data transmission security, and address privacy protection concerns. Utilizing the highly secure features of blockchain technology, the system constructs a distributed task processing network. System tasks are stored in the blockchain through smart contracts, ensuring the immutability and verifiability of task information. Smart contracts have an automatic execution capability, whereby the system can efficiently coordinate tasks and maintain the consistency of task execution information through consensus mechanisms. Additionally, adopting the Pointer Network structure for intelligent path planning based on task allocation results leads to the attainment of the shortest service routes, consequently expanding the service coverage of sustainable transportation systems while reducing energy consumption. This further advances the realization of urban sustainable transportation. Through experimental results, we verify that the proposed system enables real-time task scheduling and collaborative processing for multiple UAVs, significantly enhancing the efficiency, security, and privacy protection level of UAV swarm task execution in the context of sustainable transportation. It makes a positive contribution to building more sustainable urban transportation systems.",

      "abstract": "Large-scale point cloud semantic segmentation is crucial for understanding the scene environment in a variety of applications such as autonomous driving. To address the problem that existing large-scale semantic segmentation methods cannot fully exploit the local neighborhood information of point clouds and are prone point features, we propose a local parallel feature extraction (LPFE) module that enhances the feature representation of points by separately coding the semantic information and geometric structure of each point in point clouds. The LPFE module consists of three blocks, including the semantic information encoding (SIE) block, the position information encoding (PIE) block, and the parallel mixed pooling aggregation (PMPA) block. (1)\u00a0The SIE block uses the proposed adaptive feature fusion strategy to generate rich and higher-level semantic features for each point. (2)\u00a0The PIE block enables the network to extract fine-grained geometric features while focusing on the entire local region by establishing relative and global position relationships in the neighborhood. (3)\u00a0The PMPA block uses a bilateral structure to capture both the maximum local features and local contextual features using mixed pooling operations. The above blocks form a new network for semantic segmentation of large-scale point clouds, called \u201clocal parallel feature extraction network,\u201d which achieves competitive performance for semantic segmentation on large-scale point cloud datasets S3DIS and Semantic3D, and demonstrates the effectiveness of the modules through specific ablation experiments.",

This research integrates a trusted execution environment (TEE) into UAV-assisted federated learning and proposes a robust aggregation algorithm based on cosine distance, denoted as CosAvg. This study further designs and evaluates a TEE-based federated learning model, comparing its resource overhead with other secure aggregation frameworks, like homomorphic encryption (HE) and differential privacy (DP). Experimental results indicate a significant reduction in resource overhead for TEE against DP and HE. Moreover, the proposed CosAvg algorithm demonstrated superior robustness against adversarial scenarios, maintaining high accuracy in the presence of malicious clients. The integration of TEE and the CosAvg algorithm provides a secure and robust solution for UAV-assisted federated learning, effectively defending both gradient inversion attacks and byzantine attacks.",

      "abstract": "UAVs represent a tremendous opportunity to perform geophysical and repeated experiments, particularly in volcanic contexts. Their ability to be deployed rapidly and fly at various altitudes and the fact that they are easy to operate despite complex field conditions make them attractive for magnetic surveys. Detailed maps of the magnetic field in turn bring key constraints on the rocks\u2019 composition, thermal anomalies, intrusive systems, and crustal contrast evolution. Yet, raw magnetic field measurements require careful processing to minimize directional, positional, and crossover errors. Moreover, stitching together adjacent or overlapping surveys acquired at different times and altitudes is not a trivial task. Therefore, it is challenging in remote areas to directly evaluate the consistency of a survey and to ascertain the success of the field mission. In this paper, we present a fast algorithm allowing for a quick-look modeling of scalar magnetic intensity measurements. The approach relies on rectangular harmonic analysis (RHA). The field measurements are automatically corrected for a global main field. Then, they are projected along this main field and modeled in terms of RHA functions. The software can exploit the quality indices provided with data and a procedure is applied to mitigate the effect of outliers. Maps for the scalar and the vector anomaly fields are readily built on an interpolated regular grid leveled at a constant altitude. In order to assess the modeling and the inversion procedures, analyses are carried out with synthetic measurements derived from a high-resolution global lithospheric magnetic field model estimated on the French aeromagnetic grid and at UAV locations with some added nonrandom noise. These analyses indicate that RHA is efficient for first-order and direct mapping of the crustal magnetic field structures measured by UAVs but that it could be applied on airborne and marine magnetic intensity data covering dense and large geographical extensions.",

      "abstract": "Unmanned aircraft vehicles (UAVs) are now used to support security precautions in search and rescue operations to track and evaluate critical services, to provide cybersecurity measures by transporting security supply chain management (SCM) to sports events, and to aid efforts to safeguard the spectators from attacks. A drone may quickly fly over sports grounds, scan the area for potential dangers, and offer aerial footage and still photographs. Although UAVs provide benefits to their operators, there is a possibility that they may also pose cybersecurity threats. This guide offers recommendations for best security practices, intending to assist sports operators in protecting their networks, materials, and staff for Qatar\u2019s mega sporting events. The literature comprises several theoretical frameworks and conceptual models for security supply chains. Unfortunately, there is no practical model for measuring the behavioral intentions of professional IT and security experts. Therefore, this study conducted research in two stages. In the first stage, an in-depth systematic literature review was conducted to identify the factors and themes of UAV-based SCM for security measures. In the second phase, a survey questionnaire (N = 712) was implemented, comprising the themes and items from the literature review among professional IT and security experts. Exploratory factor analysis (EFA) was carried out with IBM SPSS, and confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) was employed with IBM AMOS. This study proposed and developed a UAV-based SCM model to provide security for Qatar\u2019s mega sporting events, which comprised five factors: traceability, security and privacy, trust, acceptability, and preparedness. This study also confirmed the validity and reliability of the newly developed scales, offering practical and proposed implications for the IT and security industries. The key findings of the study are: (1) a valid and reliable UAV-based cybersecurity framework for FIFA mega sporting events was developed; (2) five critical factors were identified, including traceability, security and privacy, trust, acceptability, and preparedness; (3) all factors were significantly and positively correlated, highlighting the complexity of managing security systems in mega sporting events.",

      "abstract": "As timely information about a project\u2019s state is key for management, we developed a data toolchain to support the monitoring of a project\u2019s progress. By extending the Measurify framework, which is dedicated to efficiently building measurement-rich applications on MongoDB, we were able to make the process of setting up the reporting tool just a matter of editing a couple of .json configuration files that specify the names and data format of the project\u2019s progress/performance indicators. Since the quantity of data to be provided at each reporting period is potentially overwhelming, some level of automation in the extraction of the indicator values is essential. To this end, it is important to make sure that most, if not all, of the quantities to be reported can be automatically extracted from the experiment data files actually used in the project. The originating use case for the toolchain is a collaborative research project on driving automation. As data representing the project\u2019s state, 330+ numerical indicators were identified. According to the project\u2019s pre-test experience, the tool is effective in supporting the preparation of periodic progress reports that extensively exploit the actual project data (i.e., obtained from the sensors\u2014real or virtual\u2014deployed for the project). While the presented use case concerns the automotive industry, we have taken care that the design choices (particularly, the definition of the resources exposed by the Application Programming Interfaces, APIs) abstract the requirements, with an aim to guarantee effectiveness in virtually any application context.",

      "abstract": "The acquisition of building structures has broad applications across various fields. However, existing methods for inferring building structures predominantly depend on manual expertise, lacking sufficient automation. To tackle this challenge, we propose a building structure inference network that utilizes UAV remote sensing images, with the PIX2PIX network serving as the foundational framework. We enhance the generator by incorporating an additive attention module that performs multi-scale feature fusion, enabling the combination of features from diverse spatial resolutions of the feature map. This modification enhances the model\u2019s capability to emphasize global relationships during the mapping process. To ensure the completeness of line elements in the generator\u2019s output, we design a novel loss function based on the Hough transform. A line penalty term is introduced that transforms the output of the generator and ground truth to the Hough domain due to the original loss function\u2019s inability to effectively constrain the completeness of straight-line elements in the generated results in the spatial domain. A dataset of the appearance features obtained from UAV remote sensing images and the internal floor plan structure is made. Using UAV remote sensing images of multi-story residential buildings, high-rise residential buildings, and office buildings as test collections, the experimental results show that our method has better performance in inferring a room\u2019s layout and the locations of load-bearing columns, achieving an average improvement of 11.2% and 21.1% over PIX2PIX in terms of the IoU and RMSE, respectively.",

      "abstract": "Autonomous mobile cleaning robots are ubiquitous today and have a vast market need. Current studies are mainly focused on autonomous cleaning performances, and there exists a research gap on monitoring the robot\u2019s health and safety. Vibration is a key indicator of system deterioration or external factors causing accelerated degradation or threats. Hence, this work proposes an artificial intelligence (AI)-enabled automated condition monitoring (CM) framework using two heterogeneous sensor datasets to predict the sources of anomalous vibration in mobile robots with high accuracy. This allows triggering proper maintenance or corrective actions based on the condition of the robot\u2019s health or workspace, easing condition-based maintenance (CbM). Anomalous vibration sources are classified as induced by uneven Terrain, Collision with obstacles, loose Assembly, and unbalanced Structure, which causes accelerated system deterioration or potential hazards. Here, an unexplored heterogeneous sensor dataset using inertial measurement unit (IMU) and current sensors is proposed for effective recognition across different vibration classes, resulting in higher-accuracy prediction. A simple-structured 1D convolutional neural network (1D CNN) is developed for training and real-time prediction. A 2D CbM map is generated by fusing the predicted classes in real time on an occupancy grid map of the workspace to monitor the conditions of the robot and workspace remotely. The evaluation test results of the proposed method show that the usage of heterogeneous sensors performs significantly more accurately (98.4%) than previous studies, which used IMU (92.2%) and camera (93.8%) sensors individually. Also, this model is comparatively fast, fit for the environment, and ideal for real-time applications in mobile robots based on field trial validations, enhancing mobile robots\u2019 productivity and operational safety.",

      "abstract": "Upcoming technological innovations and findings are immense in the field of intelligent transport systems (ITS). Cyber-physical systems (CPSs) are complex systems that integrate communication, control, and computing technology. CPSs are widely used today in intelligent transportation. For every development of a new system, there is a parallel offender who initiates the attack to destroy the root of the system developed. The attack category is infinite in such developing technology. In this paper, we have focused on preserving the security of ITS from cyber-physical systems perceptive, and various vulnerabilities, attacks, and countermeasures against ITS. Reinforcement learning is the latest buzzword in which an agent can understand and explain the environment, perform an action, and learn through trial and error. The paper also explains how reinforcement learning helps ITS in terms of security.",

      "abstract": "Weed invasion of crop fields, such as maize, is a major threat leading to yield reductions or crop right-offs for smallholder farming, especially in developing countries. A synoptic view and timeous detection of weed invasions can save the crop. The sustainable development goals (SDGs) have identified food security as a major focus point. The objectives of this study are to: (1) assess the precision of mapping maize-weed infestations using multi-temporal, unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV), and PlanetScope data by utilizing machine learning algorithms, and (2) determine the optimal timing during the maize growing season for effective weed detection. UAV and PlanetScope satellite imagery were used to map weeds using machine learning algorithms\u2014random forest (RF) and support vector machine (SVM). The input features included spectral bands, color space channels, and various vegetation indices derived from the datasets. Furthermore, principal component analysis (PCA) was used to produce principal components (PCs) that served as inputs for the classification. In this study, eight experiments are conducted, four experiments each for UAV and PlanetScope datasets spanning four months. Experiment 1 utilized all bands with the RF classifier, experiment 2 used all bands with SVM, experiment 3 employed PCs with RF, and experiment 4 utilized PCs with SVM. The results reveal that PlanetScope achieves accuracies below 49% in all four experiments. The best overall performance was observed for experiment 1 using the UAV based on the highest mean accuracy score (>0.88), which included the overall accuracy, precision, recall, F1 score, and cross-validation scores. The findings highlight the critical role of spectral information, color spaces, and vegetation indices in accurately identifying weeds during the mid-to-late stages of maize crop growth, with the higher spatial resolution of UAV exhibiting a higher precision in the classification accuracy than the PlanetScope imagery. The most optimal stage for weed detection was found to be during the reproductive stage of the crop cycle based on the best F1 scores being indicated for the maize and weeds class. This study provides pivotal information about the spatial distribution of weeds in maize fields and this information is essential for sustainable weed management in agricultural activities.",

      "abstract": "Heart sounds classification plays an important role in cardiovascular disease detection. Currently, deep learning methods for heart sound classification with heavy parameters consumption cannot be deployed in environments with limited memory and computational budgets. Besides, de-noising of heart sound signals (HSSs) can affect accuracy of heart sound classification, because erroneous removal of meaningful components may lead to heart sound distortion. In this paper, an automated heart sound classification method using adaptive wavelet threshold and 1D LDCNN (One-dimensional Lightweight Deep Convolutional Neural Network) is proposed. In this method, we exploit WT (Wavelet Transform) with an adaptive threshold to de-noise heart sound signals (HSSs). Furthermore, we utilize 1D LDCNN to realize automatic feature extraction and classification for de-noised heart sounds. Experiments on PhysioNet/CinC 2016 show that our proposed method achieves the superior classification results and excels in consumption of parameter comparing to state-of-the-art methods. ",

      "abstract": "The utilization of unmanned systems has witnessed a steady surge in popularity owing to its tremendous potential for a wide range of applications. In particular, the coordination among multiple vehicle systems has been demonstrated to possess unparalleled efficacy in accomplishing intricate and diverse tasks. In light of this, the present paper delves into the coordinated path planning mission that is accomplished by collaborative efforts amongst multiple Autonomous Underwater Vehicles (AUVs). First, considering the potential threats, arrival time windows, space, and physical constraints for the AUVs, a sophisticated coordinated path planning model is formulated in a 3D environment, serving as a systematic and structured blueprint for the underlying mechanism. Subsequently, the optimization problem is addressed through the incorporation of a restricted initialization scheme and a multi-objective clustering strategy in the proposed methodology. The resulting approach leads to the development of the Parallel Grey Wolf Optimizer (P-GWO) which exhibits strong global searching abilities and a rapid convergence rate, rendering it a dependable and effective solution. The results demonstrate a 10\u201315% improvement in convergence rate and a reduction of over 60% in the average cost value compared to reliable references, thus presenting an effective solution for underwater missions with specific requirements.",

      "abstract": "Disease and pest stress is one of the important threats to crop growth and development, which have a very adverse impact on crop yield and quality every year, even leading to crop failure. Currently, the use of plant protection unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) for pesticide spraying is the most effective means of controlling crop diseases and pests. However, the areas where crop pests and diseases occur are often presented in \u201cpoint-like\u201d or \u201cpatchy\u201d forms, and the UAV\u2019s full-coverage spraying method results in a great waste of pesticides. Therefore, there is an urgent need to research a method for identifying the area of diseases and pest stress to achieve precise targeted spraying, in order to reduce the amount of pesticides used and improve their utilization. By analyzing the low-altitude remote sensing images of crop fields taken by UAVs, real-time pesticide spraying prescription maps can be generated to meet the demand for precise targeted spraying. This review focuses on the actual needs of precise targeted spraying by plant protection UAVs. Firstly, the RS monitoring mechanism of crop diseases and pests by UAVs is studied. Secondly, a comprehensive investigation of the literature on UAV Low-altitude Remote Sensing (UAV-LARS) technology for monitoring and identifying crop diseases and pests is conducted, summarizing the research progress in monitoring and identifying crop diseases and pests, especially in wheat, cotton, and rice. Finally, the key issues to be addressed and the future development direction of UAV-LARS monitoring of crop diseases and pests are proposed.",

However, the integration of advanced technologies requires the adoption of high-tech security approaches. In this paper, we present a framework that promises to enhance the security and privacy of smart farms by leveraging the decentralized nature of blockchain technology. The framework stores and manages data acquired from IoT devices installed in smart farms using a distributed ledger architecture, which provides secure and tamper-proof data storage and ensures the integrity and validity of the data. The study uses the AWS cloud, ESP32, the smart farm security monitoring framework, and the Ethereum Rinkeby smart contract mechanism, which enables the automated execution of pre-defined rules and regulations. As a result of a proof-of-concept implementation, the system can detect and respond to security threats in real time, and the results illustrate its usefulness in improving the security of smart farms. The number of accepted blockchain transactions on smart farming requests fell from 189,000 to 109,450 after carrying out the first three tests while the next three testing phases showed a rise in the number of blockchain transactions accepted on smart farming requests from 176,000 to 290,786. We further observed that the lesser the time taken to induce the device alarm, the higher the number of blockchain transactions accepted on smart farming requests, which demonstrates the efficacy of blockchain-based poisoning attack mitigation in smart farming.",

      "abstract": "Recently, applying the utilization of RGB-D data for robot perception tasks has garnered significant attention in domains like robotics and autonomous driving. However, a prominent challenge in this field lies in the substantial impact of feature robustness on both segmentation and pose estimation tasks. To tackle this challenge, we proposed a pioneering two-stage hybrid Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) architecture, which connects segmentation and pose estimation in tandem. Specifically, we developed Cross-Modal (CM) and Cross-Layer (CL) modules to exploit the complementary information from RGB and depth modalities, as well as the hierarchical features from diverse layers of the network. The CM and CL integration strategy significantly enhanced the segmentation accuracy by effectively capturing spatial and contextual information. Furthermore, we introduced the Convolutional Block Attention Module (CBAM), which dynamically recalibrated the feature maps, enabling the network to focus on informative regions and channels, thereby enhancing the overall performance of the pose estimation task. We conducted extensive experiments on benchmark datasets to evaluate the proposed method and achieved exceptional target pose estimation results, with an average accuracy of 94.5% using the ADD-S AUC metric and 97.6% of ADD-S smaller than 2 cm. These results demonstrate the superior performance of our proposed method.",

      "abstract": "Unmanned aircraft systems (UASs) with autonomous maneuvering decision capabilities are expected to play a key role in future unmanned systems applications. While reinforcement learning has proven successful in solving UAS path planning problems in simple urban environments, it remains under-researched for some complex mountain environments. In this paper, the path planning of UAS swarm for the low-altitude rapid traverse in diverse environments is studied when facing the threats of complex terrain, radars and swarm failure. First, a UAS swarm radar detection probability is built up for evaluating the radar detection threat by a networked radar system, where the detection probability of a UAS swarm is equated to a single UAS with appropriate position and radar cross section named as the swarm virtual leader. Second, a reinforcement learning based path planning method is proposed to seek the optimal path for the swarm virtual leader which balances instantaneous reward, including detection probability and path constraints with terminal reward, including normal rate. Third, a formation optimization strategy is designed to further reduce the threat of radar detection through dynamically adjusting the formation geometry. Final, simulations in the complex environment have been carried out to evaluate the performance of the proposed method, where the path quality, task success rate and normal rate are counted as the performance indicators.",

      "abstract": "Adversarial attacks can compromise the robustness of real-world detection models. However, evaluating these models under real-world conditions poses challenges due to resource-intensive experiments. Virtual simulations offer an alternative, but the absence of standardized benchmarks hampers progress. Addressing this, we propose an innovative instant-level data generation pipeline using the CARLA simulator. Through this pipeline, we establish the Discrete and Continuous Instant-level (DCI) dataset, enabling comprehensive experiments involving three detection models and three physical adversarial attacks. Our findings highlight diverse model performances under adversarial conditions. YOLO v6 demonstrates remarkable resilience, exhibiting just a marginal 6.59% average drop in average precision (AP). In contrast, the ASA attack yields a substantial 14.51% average AP reduction, twice the effect of other algorithms. We also note that static scenes yield higher recognition AP values, and outcomes remain relatively consistent across varying weather conditions. Intriguingly, our study suggests that advancements in adversarial attack algorithms may be approaching its \u201climitation\u201d. In summary, our work underscores the significance of adversarial attacks in real-world contexts and introduces the DCI dataset as a versatile benchmark. Our findings provide valuable insights for enhancing the robustness of detection models and offer guidance for future research endeavors in the realm of adversarial attacks.",

      "abstract": "Controlling marine pollution caused by hydrocarbons spilling from oil tanker accidents and oil rigs is urgently needed. Conventional pollution control vessels currently in service worldwide do not meet certain safety criteria, storage capacities, and response times owing to their technical shortcomings. This study proposes a new concept of multimission and autonomous antipollution vessels capable of acting quickly and efficiently to counter such pollution threats. The objective of this study is to carry out a total and rapid recovery of the spilled oil slick in complete safety. Hence, optimizing the bulbous bow adapted to the pollution control vessel during its displacement is necessary to horizontally straighten the accompanying waves formed around the hull and to laminate the flow upstream of the side openings for the recovery of spilled oil. This optimization improves the nautical qualities specific to this ship to reduce the total resistance to progress and to standardize the flow upstream of the side openings to allow the collection of spilled oil at high speed. This optimization study can open a field of application for the construction of modern multi-mission pollution control vessels. Tests in hull basins will be planned to validate and adjust the results obtained from the simulations.",

      "abstract": "Forest fires have become increasingly prevalent and devastating in many regions worldwide, posing significant threats to biodiversity, ecosystems, human settlements, and the economy. The United States (USA) and Portugal are two countries that have experienced recurrent forest fires, raising concerns about the role of forest fuel and vegetation accumulation as contributing factors. One preventive measure which can be adopted to minimize the impact of the forest fires is to cut the amount of forest fuel available to burn, using autonomous Unmanned Ground Vehicles (UGV) that make use of Artificial intelligence (AI) to detect and classify the forest vegetation to keep and the forest fire fuel to be cut. In this paper, an innovative study of forest vegetation detection and classification using ground vehicles\u2019 RGB images is presented to support autonomous forest cleaning operations to prevent fires, using an Unmanned Ground Vehicle (UGV). The presented work compares two recent high-performance Deep Learning methodologies, YOLOv5 and YOLOR, to detect and classify forest vegetation in five classes: grass, live vegetation, cut vegetation, dead vegetation, and tree trunks. For the training of the two models, we used a dataset acquired in a nearby forest. A key challenge for autonomous forest vegetation cleaning is the reliable discrimination of obstacles (e.g., tree trunks or stones) that must be avoided, and objects that need to be identified (e.g., dead/dry vegetation) to enable the intended action of the robot. With the obtained results, it is concluded that YOLOv5 presents an overall better performance. Namely, the object detection architecture is faster to train, faster in inference speed (achieved in real time), has a small trained weight file, and attains higher precision, therefore making it highly suitable for forest vegetation detection.",

      "abstract": "By identifying and responding to any malicious behavior that could endanger the system, the Intrusion Detection System (IDS) is crucial for preserving the security of the Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) network. The benefit of anomaly-based IDS is that they are able to recognize zero-day attacks due to the fact that they do not rely on a signature database to identify abnormal activity. In order to improve control over datasets and the process, this study proposes using an automated machine learning (AutoML) technique to automate the machine learning processes for IDS. Our ground-breaking architecture, known as AID4I, makes use of automatic machine learning methods for intrusion detection. Through automation of preprocessing, feature selection, model selection, and hyperparameter tuning, the objective is to identify an appropriate machine learning model for intrusion detection. Experimental studies demonstrate that the AID4I framework successfully proposes a suitable model. The integrity, security, and confidentiality of data transmitted across the IIoT network can be ensured by automating machine learning processes in the IDS to enhance its capacity to identify and stop threatening activities. With a comprehensive solution that takes advantage of the latest advances in automated machine learning methods to improve network security, AID4I is a powerful and effective instrument for intrusion detection. In preprocessing module, three distinct imputation methods are utilized to handle missing data, ensuring the robustness of the intrusion detection system in the presence of incomplete information. Feature selection module adopts a hybrid approach that combines Shapley values and genetic algorithm. The Parameter Optimization module encompasses a diverse set of 14 classification methods, allowing for thorough exploration and optimization of the parameters associated with each algorithm. By carefully tuning these parameters, the framework enhances its adaptability and accuracy in identifying potential intrusions. Experimental results demonstrate that the AID4I framework can achieve high levels of accuracy in detecting network intrusions up to 14.39% on public datasets, outperforming traditional intrusion detection methods while concurrently reducing the elapsed time for training and testing.",

      "abstract": "Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), or drones, have revolutionized a wide range of industries, including monitoring, agriculture, surveillance, and supply chain. However, their widespread use also poses significant challenges, such as public safety, privacy, and cybersecurity. Cyberattacks, targeting UAVs have become more frequent, which highlights the need for robust security solutions. Blockchain technology, the foundation of cryptocurrencies has the potential to address these challenges. This study suggests a platform that utilizes blockchain technology to manage drone operations securely and confidentially. By incorporating blockchain technology, the proposed method aims to increase the security and privacy of drone data. The suggested platform stores information on a public blockchain located on Ethereum and leverages the Ganache platform to ensure secure and private blockchain transactions. The MetaMask wallet for Ethbalance is necessary for BCT transactions. The present research finding shows that the proposed approach\u2019s efficiency and security features are superior to existing methods. This study contributes to the development of a secure and efficient system for managing drone operations that could have significant applications in various industries. The proposed platform\u2019s security measures could mitigate privacy concerns, minimize cyber security risk, and enhance public safety, ultimately promoting the widespread adoption of UAVs. The results of the study demonstrate that the blockchain can ensure the fulfillment of core security needs such as authentication, privacy preservation, confidentiality, integrity, and access control.",

      "abstract": "Thanks to its superior imaging resolution and range, light detection and ranging (LiDAR) is fast becoming an indispensable optical perception technology for intelligent automation systems including autonomous vehicles and robotics1\u20133. The development of next-generation LiDAR systems critically needs a non-mechanical beam-steering system that scans the laser beam in space. Various beam-steering technologies4 have been developed, including optical phased array5\u20138, spatial light modulation9\u201311, focal plane switch array12,13, dispersive frequency comb14,15 and spectro-temporal modulation16. However, many of these systems continue to be bulky, fragile and expensive. Here we report an on-chip, acousto-optic beam-steering technique that uses only a single gigahertz acoustic transducer to steer light beams into free space. Exploiting the physics of Brillouin scattering17,18, in which beams steered at different angles are labelled with unique frequency shifts, this technique uses a single coherent receiver to resolve the angular position of an object in the frequency domain, and enables frequency\u2013angular resolving LiDAR. We demonstrate a simple device construction, control system for beam steering and frequency domain detection scheme. The system achieves frequency-modulated continuous-wave ranging with an 18\u00b0 field of view, 0.12\u00b0 angular resolution and a ranging distance up to&nbsp;115\u2009m. The demonstration can be scaled up to an array realizing miniature, low-cost frequency\u2013angular resolving LiDAR imaging systems with a wide two-dimensional field of view. This development represents a step towards the widespread use of LiDAR in automation, navigation and robotics. Three-dimensional imaging using a frequency\u2013angular resolving and frequency-modulated continuous-wave LiDAR enabled by a chip-scale&nbsp;acousto-optic beam-steering device has been demonstrated, with the simplicity and low cost of the device making this a promising technology.",

      "abstract": "Agriculture 5.0 refers to the next phase of agricultural development, building upon the previous digital revolution in the agrarian sector and aiming to transform the agricultural industry to be smarter, more effective, and ecologically conscious. Farming processes have already started becoming more efficient due to the development of digital technologies, including big data, artificial intelligence (AI), robotics, the Internet of Things (IoT), and virtual and augmented reality. Farmers can make the most of the resources at their disposal thanks to this data-driven approach, allowing them to effectively cultivate and sustain crops on arable land. The European Union (EU) aims to make food systems fair, healthy, and environmentally sustainable through the Green Deal and its farm-to-fork, soil, and biodiversity strategies, zero pollution action plan, and upcoming sustainable use of pesticides regulation. Many of the historical synthetic pesticides are not currently registered in the EU market. In addition, the continuous use of a limited number of active ingredients with the same mode of action scales up pests/pathogens/weed resistance potential. Increasing plant protection challenges as well as having fewer chemical pesticides to apply require innovation and smart solutions for crop production. Biopesticides tend to pose fewer risks to human health and the environment, their efficacy depends on various factors that cannot be controlled through traditional application strategies. This paper aims to disclose the contribution of robotic systems in Agriculture 5.0 ecosystems, highlighting both the challenges and limitations of this technology. Specifically, this work documents current threats to agriculture (climate change, invasive pests, diseases, and costs) and how robotics and AI can act as countermeasures to deal with such threats. Finally, specific case studies and the application of intelligent robotic systems to them are analyzed, and the architecture for our intelligent decision system is proposed.",

      "abstract": "In many automated motion planning systems, vehicles are tasked with tracking a reference path or trajectory that is safe by design. However, due to various uncertainties, real vehicles may deviate from such references, potentially leading to collisions. This paper presents rigorous reachable set bounding methods for rapidly enclosing the set of possible deviations under uncertainty, which is critical information for online safety verification. The proposed approach applies recent advances in the theory of differential inequalities that exploit redundant model equations to achieve sharp bounds using only simple interval calculations. These methods have been shown to produce very sharp bounds at low cost for nonlinear systems in other application domains, but they rely on problem-specific insights to identify appropriate redundant equations, which makes them difficult to generalize and automate. Here, we demonstrate the application of these methods to tracking problems for the first time using three representative case studies. We find that defining redundant equations in terms of Lyapunov-like functions is particularly effective. The results show that this technique can produce effective bounds with computational times that are orders of magnitude less than the planned time horizon, making this a promising approach for online safety verification. This performance, however, comes at the cost of low generalizability, specifically due to the need for problem-specific insights and advantageous problem structure, such as the existence of appropriate Lyapunov-like functions.",

      "abstract": "Many issues arise from the recession of sea cliffs, including threats to coastal communities and infrastructure. The best proxy to study cliff instability processes is the cliff face evolution. Unfortunately, due to its verticality, this proxy is difficult to observe and measure. This study proposed and compared three remote sensing methods based on structure-from-motion (SfM) photogrammetry or stereorestitution: boat-based SfM photogrammetry with smartphones, unmanned aerial system (UAS) or unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) photogrammetry with centimetric positioning and Pl\u00e9iades tri-stereo imagery. An inter-comparison showed that the mean distance between the point clouds produced by the different methods was about 2 m. The satellite approach had the advantage of covering greater distances. The SfM photogrammetry approach from a boat allowed for a better reconstruction of the cliff foot (especially in the case of overhangs). However, over long distances, significant geometric distortions affected the method. The UAS with centimetric positioning offered a good compromise, but flight autonomy limited the extent of the monitored area. SfM photogrammetry from a boat can be used as an initial estimate for risk management services following a localized emergency. For long-term monitoring of the coastline and its evolution, satellite photogrammetry is recommended.",

      "abstract": "Free Space Optical (FSO) communication has potential terrestrial and non-terrestrial applications. It allows large bandwidth for higher data transfer capacity. Due to its high directivity, it has a potential security advantage over traditional radio frequency (RF) communications. However, eavesdropping attacks are still possible in long non-terrestrial transmission FSO links, where the geometry of the link allows foreign flying objects such as Unmanned Aerial vehicles (UAVs) and drones to interrupt the links. This exposes non-terrestrial FSO links to adversary security attacks. Hence, data security techniques implementation is required to achieve immune FSO communication links. Unlike the commonly proposed physical layer security techniques, this paper presents a lab-based demonstration of a secured FSO communication link based on data cryptography using the GNU Radio platform and software-defined radio (SDR) hardware. The utilized encryption algorithm (Xsalsa20) in this paper requires high-time complexity to be broken by power-limited flying objects that interrupt the FSO beam. The results show that implementing cryptographic encryption techniques into FSO systems provided resilience against eavesdropping attacks and preserved data security. The experiment results show that, at a distance of 250 mm and laser output power of 10 mW, the system achieves a packet delivery rate of 92% and transmission rate of 10 Mbit/s. This is because the SDR used in this experiment requires a minimum received electrical amplitude of 27.5 mV to process the received signal. Long distance and higher data rates can be achieved using less sensitive SDR hardware.",

      "abstract": "The entropy-oriented approach called security- or cybersecurity-informed safety (SIS or CSIS, respectively) is discussed and developed in order to analyse and evaluate the safety and dependability of autonomous transport systems (ATSs) such as unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), unmanned maritime vehicles (UMVs), and satellites. This approach allows for extending and integrating the known techniques FMECA (Failure Modes, Effects, and Criticality Analysis) and IMECA (Intrusion MECA), as well as developing the new SISMECA (SIS-based Intrusion Modes, Effects, and Criticality Analysis) technique. The ontology model and templates for SISMECA implementation are suggested. The methodology of safety assessment is based on (i) the application and enhancement of SISMECA considering the particularities of various ATSs and roles of actors (regulators, developers, operators, customers); (ii) the development of a set of scenarios describing the operation of ATS in conditions of cyberattacks and physical influences; (iii) AI contribution to system protection for the analysed domains; (iv) scenario-based development and analysis of user stories related to different cyber-attacks, as well as ways to protect ATSs from them via AI means/platforms; (v) profiling of AI platform requirements by use of characteristics based on AI quality model, risk-based assessment of cyberattack criticality, and efficiency of countermeasures which actors can implement. Examples of the application of SISMECA assessment are presented and discussed.",

      "abstract": "The integration of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) and the Internet of Things (IoT) has opened up new possibilities in various industries. However, with the increasing number of Internet of Drones (IoD) networks, the risk of network attacks is also rising, making it increasingly difficult to identify malicious attacks on IoD systems. To improve the accuracy of intrusion detection for IoD and reduce the probability of false positives and false negatives, this paper proposes a Q-learning-based two-layer cooperative intrusion detection algorithm (Q-TCID). Specifically, Q-TCID employs an intelligent dynamic voting algorithm that optimizes multi-node collaborative intrusion detection strategies at the host level, effectively reducing the probability of false positives and false negatives in intrusion detection. Additionally, to further reduce energy consumption, an intelligent auditing algorithm is proposed to carry out system-level auditing of the host-level detections. Both algorithms employ Q-learning optimization strategies and interact with the external environment in their respective Markov decision processes, leading to close-to-optimal intrusion detection strategies. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed Q-TCID algorithm optimizes the defense strategies of the IoD system, effectively prolongs the mean time to failure (MTTF) of the system, and significantly reduces the energy consumption of intrusion detection.",

      "abstract": "Weary of costly on-the-ground military interventions, Western nations have increasingly turned to \u201cRemote Warfare\u201d to address the continued threat of terrorism. Despite the centrality of drone strikes to the practice of Remote Warfare, we still know relatively little about their effectiveness as instruments of coercion. This article offers a conceptual framework for assessing their coercive efficacy in counterterrorism. We argue that remote control&nbsp;drones are fundamentally different from traditional airpower, owing to changes in persistence, lethality, and relative risk. Critically, these technological characteristics produce weaker coercive effects than often assumed. While persistent surveillance combined with lethal, low-risk strikes renders armed drones highly effective at altering the cost\u2013benefit calculations of terrorists, these same technological attributes cause them to be less effective at clear communication, credibility, and assurance\u2014other key factors in coercion success. Overall, drone strikes are poor instruments of coercion in counterterrorism, underscoring some potential limitations of Remote Warfare.",

      "abstract": "The current study investigated the effect of leading-edge slats on the longitudinal stability at high angles of attack of a Blended-Wing-Body (BWB) Unmanned Air Vehicle (UAV). Using a Design of Experiments (DOE) approach and, specifically, the Taguchi method, four leading-edge slat design parameters were investigated on three different levels. These parameters were the slat semi-span, the rotation of the slat element, the extension forward of the leading edge and the downward drop below the leading edge. An L9 orthogonal array (OA) was used to investigate the influence of these key design parameters using three performance criteria, namely the angle at which pitch break occurs, the corresponding speed and the distance between the Neutral point of each configuration and the Neutral point of the reference platform. The investigation was conducted by using high-fidelity Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) methods for each of the nine configurations defined by the L9 OA, over a range of angles of attack between \u22124 and 16 degrees. Based on these results, and using a Signal-to-Noise ratio (SNR) analysis, two combinations were eventually derived, one that optimized pitch break angle and speed and one that optimized longitudinal stability. Finally, the Pareto Analysis of Variance (ANOVA) technique was conducted to define the contribution of each of the six design parameters on the selected performance criteria. More specifically, the semi-span seemed to have the most significant effect on pitch break angle and speed, whereas the rotation of the slat element was the most important parameter with regard to static stability.",

      "abstract": "Highly robust networks can resist attacks, as when some UAVs fail, the remaining UAVs can still transmit data to each other. In order to improve the robustness of a multi-UAV network, most methods construct the network by adjusting the positions of the UAVs and adding a large number of links. However, having a large number of links greatly consumes communication resources and increases serious signal interference. Therefore, it is necessary to study a method that can improve robustness and reduce the number of links. In this paper, we propose a method that consists of combining formation control and link selection, which can work in a distributed manner. For formation control, our method keeps the UAVs compact in the obstacle environment through an improved artificial potential field. The compact formation enables UAVs to have a large number of neighbors. For link selection, reinforcement learning is used to improve the robustness of the network and reduce the number of network edges. In the simulation of the 3D urban environment, three failure modes are used to verify the robustness of the network. The experimental results show that even if the number of links is reduced by 20%, the networks designed by our method still have strong robustness.",

      "abstract": "One of the most significant recent advances in technology is the advent of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), i.e., drones. They have widened the scope of possible applications and provided a platform for a wide range of creative responses to a variety of challenges. The Internet of Drones (IoD) is a relatively new concept that has arisen as a consequence of the combination of drones and the Internet. The fifth-generation (5G) and beyond cellular networks (i.e., drones in networks beyond 5G) are promising solutions for achieving safe drone operations and applications. They may have many applications, like surveillance or urban areas, security, surveillance, retaliation, delivering items, smart farming, film production, capturing nature videos, and many more. Due to the fact that it is susceptible to a wide variety of cyber-attacks, there are certain concerns regarding the privacy and security of IoD communications. In this paper, a secure blockchain-enabled authentication key management framework with the big data analytics feature for drones in networks beyond 5G applications is proposed (in short, SBBDA-IoD). The security of SBBDA-IoD against multiple attacks is demonstrated through a detailed security analysis. The Scyther tool is used to perform a formal security verification test on the SBBDA-IoD\u2019s security, confirming the system\u2019s resistance to various potential attacks. A detailed comparative analysis has identified that SBBDA-IoD outperforms the other schemes by a significant margin. Finally, a real-world implementation of SBBDA-IoD is shown to evaluate its effect on several measures of performance.",

      "abstract": "In this paper, the sociocultural, ethical, and political impact of civilian and military uses of AI and data will be explored. In an increasingly multi-polar world, a fierce global contest has emerged between NATO, China, and Russia concerning the ethics, governance and regulation of data, artificial intelligence, autonomous decision systems (ADS), and autonomous weapons systems (AWS). The use of AI and data systems like AWS in the military has been widely criticized for use cases like an&nbsp;algorithm&nbsp;determining targets for drone strikes. These systems carry the risk of algorithmic bias due to flaws in underlying training data and its interpretation, difficulty in maintaining meaningful human control, the potential for more conflict due to fewer barriers to military engagement, and uncertainty in accountability for machine error. This represents one of the principle challenges of \u201cremote warfare\u201d conducted through AWS. In turn, the interchange between AI and data technologies for civilian and military purposes risks blurring the traditional legal and normative lines between these domains. To address these challenges, it is important to consider the increasing convergence of civilian and military logics in the deployment of new technologies, following on a longstanding trend of military to civilian transfers of technology, research and development (R&amp;D), hardware, software, culture, and personnel. It is thus argued that the trends toward integrating civilian and military law enforcement domains threaten to erode important normative and legal safeguards around human rights which are central to liberal democracy. By blurring the lines between civilian and combatant in the eyes of law enforcement, one risks accelerating the retreat of liberal democracy globally, giving rise to authoritarian police states.",

      "abstract": "The small-drone technology domain is the outcome of a breakthrough in technological advancement for drones. The Internet of Things (IoT) is used by drones to provide inter-location services for navigation. But, due to issues related to their architecture and design, drones are not immune to threats related to security and privacy. Establishing a secure and reliable network is essential to obtaining optimal performance from drones. While small drones offer promising avenues for growth in civil and defense industries, they are prone to attacks on safety, security, and privacy. The current architecture of small drones necessitates modifications to their data transformation and privacy mechanisms to align with domain requirements. This research paper investigates the latest trends in safety, security, and privacy related to drones, and the Internet of Drones (IoD), highlighting the importance of secure drone networks that are impervious to interceptions and intrusions. To mitigate cyber-security threats, the proposed framework incorporates intelligent machine learning models into the design and structure of IoT-aided drones, rendering adaptable and secure technology. Furthermore, in this work, a new dataset is constructed, a merged dataset comprising a drone dataset and two benchmark datasets. The proposed strategy outperforms the previous algorithms and achieves 99.89% accuracy on the drone dataset and 91.64% on the merged dataset. Overall, this intelligent framework gives a potential approach to improving the security and resilience of cyber\u2013physical satellite systems, and IoT-aided aerial vehicle systems, addressing the rising security challenges in an interconnected world.",

      "abstract": "Future autonomous driving and next-generation vehicle control require further advances in vehicle dynamic state estimation. This paper describes a new localization approach based on the development of a personalized dynamic model for an autonomous car-like vehicle called \u201cRobucar\u201d. The proposed approach is used within a framework for the development of a Robucar Simulator Platform. This approach is firstly used offline (due to the computation time constraint) employing recorded odometric data to study and validate some developed applications related to the navigation function such as obstacle avoidance, target tracking, etc. However, this approach can be used online to obtain a good localization in real time, by using a powerful embedded system or simplifying some aspects not easily influenced in the proposed dynamic model. Localization issues have been discussed while analyzing some methods used in mobile robotics and describing the background and choices made in this paper. Using an appropriate tire-road contact model, dynamic equations of the forces and torques acting on the Robucar have been determined. The proposed dynamic model discussed in this paper has 18 Degrees of Freedom (DoF), considering fine technical characteristics related to the electrical motion, the geometry of the bi-steering system, and the tire-road contact type. Secondly, the developed dynamic model has been exploited to provide the Robucar\u2019s position in outdoor environments using odometric measurements, adjusting several internal parameters. Simulations are carried out to evaluate the behavior of the developed dynamic model. Furthermore, an experimental test has been realized outdoors for a distance of 513&nbsp;m to validate our new localization approach. The obtained experimental results are interesting and promising, showing clearly the effectiveness of the new approach adopted for localization in offline mode. The accuracy provided by the proposed dynamic model compared to the kinematic model is highlighted. Moreover, the developed dynamic model can be used in several fields other than localization, such as motion planning, control, and Robucar stability study.",

      "abstract": "In modern times, closed-loop control systems (CLCSs) play a prominent role in a wide application range, from production machinery via automated vehicles to robots. CLCSs actively manipulate the actual values of a process to match predetermined setpoints, typically in real time and with remarkable precision. However, the development, modeling, tuning, and optimization of CLCSs barely exploit the potential of artificial intelligence (AI). This paper explores novel opportunities and research directions in CLCS engineering, presenting potential designs and methodologies incorporating AI. Combining these opportunities and directions makes it evident that employing AI in developing and implementing CLCSs is indeed feasible. Integrating AI into CLCS development or AI directly within CLCSs can lead to a significant improvement in stakeholder confidence. Integrating AI in CLCSs raises the question: How can AI in CLCSs be trusted so that its promising capabilities can be used safely? One does not trust AI in CLCSs due to its unknowable nature caused by its extensive set of parameters that defy complete testing. Consequently, developers working on AI-based CLCSs must be able to rate the impact of the trainable parameters on the system accurately. By following this path, this paper highlights two key aspects as essential research directions towards safe AI-based CLCSs: (I) the identification and elimination of unproductive layers in artificial neural networks (ANNs) for reducing the number of trainable parameters without influencing the overall outcome, and (II) the utilization of the solution space of an ANN to define the safety-critical scenarios of an AI-based CLCS.",

      "abstract": "Visual object detection is an essential task for the intelligent navigation of an Unmanned Surface Vehicle (USV), which can sense the obstacles while navigating. However, the harsh illumination conditions and large scale variation of the objects significantly harm the performance of object detection methods. To address the above problems, we propose a robust water surface object detection method named multi-scale feature fusion network with intrinsic decomposition generative adversarial network data augmentation (MFFDet-IDGAN). We introduce intrinsic decomposition as data augmentation for the object detection to achieve illumination adapting. And an intrinsic decomposition generative adversarial network (IDGAN) is proposed to achieve unsupervised intrinsic decomposition. Moreover, the multi-scale feature fusion network (MFFDet) adopts an improved bidirectional feature pyramid network (BiFPN) and spatial pyramid pooling (SPP) blocks to fuse features of different resolution for better multi-scale detection. And an improved weighted stochastic weight averaging (SWA) is proposed and applied in the training process to improve the generalization performance. We conduct extensive experiments on the Water Surface Object Detection Dataset (WSODD), and the results show that the proposed method can achieve 44% improvement over the baseline. And we further test our method on a real USV in the sailing process, the results show that our method can exceeding the baseline by 4.5%.",

      "abstract": "Content-based image retrieval (CBIR) is an automated process that seeks to retrieve similar/closer images from a large-scale image collection by extracting visual content from the images themselves. In general, CBIR systems consist of two main steps: 1) feature extraction and 2) feature matching. The extraction of features entails decreasing the amount of data required to describe a large set of data. Feature matching, on the other hand, is the process of comparing the extracted features from the query image to the extracted features from images in the database using a certain distance metric. Meanwhile, the extracted features of the query image are compared to those of the images in the database throughout the retrieval process, allowing each indexed image to be ranked according to its distance from the query image. This paper exploits to take the advantage from both global and local feature and hence a hybrid CBIR technique is devised which contains two layers of filtering. The first layer uses the Bag of Features (BoF) technique to compare the query image to all images in the database in order to eliminate/exclude as many dissimilar images as possible. This results in the retrieval of a number of images that are closer to the query image. The second layer aims to compare the query image to the retrieved images earned from the first layer. This is based on the extraction of texture-based and color-based features. The Local Binary Pattern (LBP) and Discrete Wavelet Transform (DWT) were used as texture features. Color features were also used from three distinct color spaces (RGB, HSV, and YCbCr). Entropy and mean of every single channel are measured. The experiments are carried out in details utilizing the widely used and well-known Corel-1&nbsp;k database. In regards of precision rate, the experimental findings show that the proposed two-layer strategy outperforms existing state-of-the-art approaches, with top-10 and top-20 precision rates of 86.65% and 81%, respectively.",

      "abstract": "The importance of vehicle security has increased in recent years in the automotive field, drawing the attention of both the industry and academia. This is due to the rise in cybersecurity threats caused by (1) the increase in vehicle connectivity schemes, such as the Internet of Things, vehicle-to-x communication, and over-the-air updates, and (2) the increased impact of such threats because of the added functionalities that are controlled by vehicle software. These causes and threats are further amplified in autonomous vehicles, which are generally equipped with more electronic control units (ECUs) that are connected through controller area networks (CANs). Due to the holistic nature of CANs, attacks on the networks can affect the functionality of all vehicle ECUs and the whole system. This can lead to a breach of privacy, denial of services, alteration of vehicle performance, and exposure to safety threats. Although cryptographic encryption and authentication algorithms and intrusion detection systems (IDS) are currently being used to detect and prevent CAN bus attacks, they have certain limitations. Therefore, this study proposed a mitigation scheme that can detect and prevent such attacks at the ECU level, which could address the limitations of existing algorithms. This study proposed the usage of a secure boot scheme to detect and prevent the execution of malicious codes, as the presence of one or more ECUs with a malicious code is the root cause of most CAN bus attacks. Secure boot schemes apply cryptographic data integrity algorithms to ensure that only authentic and untampered software can run on the vehicle\u2019s ECUs. The selection of an appropriate cryptographic algorithm is important because it affects the secure boot schemes\u2019 security level and performance. Therefore, this study also tested and compared the performance of the proposed secure boot scheme with five different data security algorithms implemented using the hardware security module (HSM) of the TC399 32-bit AURIX\u2122 TriCore\u2122 microcontroller through an electric autonomous vehicle\u2019s control unit. The tests showed that the two most favorable schemes with the selected hardware are the secure boot scheme with the cipher-based message authentication code (CMAC), because it possesses the highest performance with an execution rate of 26.07 (ms/MB), and the secure boot scheme with the elliptic curve digital signature algorithm (ECDSA), because it provides a higher security level with an acceptable compromise in speed. This study also introduced and tested a novel variation of the ECDSA algorithm based on the CMAC algorithm, which was found to have a 19% performance gain over the standard ECDSA-based secure boot scheme.",

      "abstract": "Radio jamming represents a serious threat in wireless networks that can cause denial of service (DoS) attacks for the network users. The jammer transmits jamming signals to disrupt the normal operation of the wireless networks. With proliferation of unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV)-based wireless networks and Internet of Things technologies, jamming attacks have become a major challenge to the practical adoption of these technologies. In this paper, we investigate the problem of optimizing the performance of the UAV data collection from ground IoT devices in presence of a malicious jammer. The IoT devices are clustered, and the UAV collects the data from the cluster heads (CHs) such that the harmful effect of the jammer is mitigated. The objective is to minimize the flight time of the UAV while collecting the data from the ground IoT devices in presence of the jamming attack. We modeled our problem mathematically as an integer linear program (ILP). Due to the difficulty of solving the optimization problem when the scale of the problem is large, we proposed Jamming-Aware UAV Routing and IoT Devices Clustering Algorithm (JA-RC). This algorithm is Genetic-based and can solve the original optimization problem in a more efficient way. Then, we investigate the performance of the proposed algorithm under different settings and scenarios.",

      "abstract": "Large concentrations of air-suspended particulate matter (PM) in megacities represent an important health risk for their populations, but PM time series are often missing or too short to quantify the associated burden of diseases. In this study, we propose a model for retrieving the surface PM in Cairo (Egypt) and Delhi (India) from the automated measurements of aerosol optical depth (AOD), precipitable water (PW), and Angstr\u00f6m exponent (AE) performed by the sunphotometers of the Aerosol Robotics Network (AERONET). For this we exploit the (1) synchronous measurements performed from 2010 to 2015 at the headquarters of the Egyptian Meteorological Authority and in 2009 at the Gual Pahari station (25&nbsp;km south of Delhi) and (2) the ERA5 estimate of the planetary boundary layer height (H). The correlation between the surface PM10 and the AOD is primarily controlled by the variations of PW and secondarily by those of H: for similar surface PM10 concentrations, the AOD tends to be the largest in summer because of the hygroscopic enhancement of the mass extinction efficiency (\u03c3) of the particles and their dilution in the more developed mixing layer. The variations of composition also play a significant role in Cairo. This effect, particularly marked in spring (coinciding with the dust season), can be parameterized as a linear function of AE. Finally, we show that the variations of the surface PM10 concentration at the two sites can be retrieved simply from those of the AOD, PW, AE and H. At the weekly temporal resolution, the agreement between the model and the observations is very good at the two locations (correlation coefficient\u2009&gt;\u20090.81, relative mean absolute error\u2009&lt;\u200915%). This validates indirectly the assumption made in the development of the model, namely that the aerosols are mostly confined to the mixing layer of the two megacities and not transported in the free atmosphere. Provided a few years of surface PM measurements are available, the methodology proposed in this study could be easily applied to any other AERONET station.",

      "abstract": "The past decade has witnessed the rapid development of autonomous driving systems. However, it remains a daunting task to achieve full autonomy, especially when it comes to understanding the ever-changing, complex driving scenes. To alleviate the difficulty of perception, self-driving vehicles are usually equipped with a suite of sensors (e.g., cameras, LiDARs), hoping to capture the scenes with overlapping perspectives to minimize blind spots. Fusing these data streams and exploiting their complementary properties is thus rapidly becoming the current trend. Nonetheless, combining data that are captured by different sensors with drastically different ranging/ima-ging mechanisms is not a trivial task; instead, many factors need to be considered and optimized. If not careful, data from one sensor may act as noises to data from another sensor, with even poorer results by fusing them. Thus far, there has been no in-depth guidelines to designing the multi-modal fusion based 3D perception algorithms. To fill in the void and motivate further investigation, this survey conducts a thorough study of tens of recent deep learning based multi-modal 3D detection networks (with a special emphasis on LiDAR-camera fusion), focusing on their fusion stage (i.e., when to fuse), fusion inputs (i.e., what to fuse), and fusion granularity (i.e., how to fuse). These important design choices play a critical role in determining the performance of the fusion algorithm. In this survey, we first introduce the background of popular sensors used for self-driving, their data properties, and the corresponding object detection algorithms. Next, we discuss existing datasets that can be used for evaluating multi-modal 3D object detection algorithms. Then we present a review of multi-modal fusion based 3D detection networks, taking a close look at their fusion stage, fusion input and fusion granularity, and how these design choices evolve with time and technology. After the review, we discuss open challenges as well as possible solutions. We hope that this survey can help researchers to get familiar with the field and embark on investigations in the area of multi-modal 3D object detection.",

      "abstract": "An essential trait in the life history of any animal species is reproduction, including parental care. In seabirds, these actions are well defined and stereotyped. Our study focused on analyzing the parental care behavior, reproductive success, and phenology of the southern rockhopper penguin (Eudyptes chrysocome chrysocome) population of Isla Ping\u00fcino, Argentina, through the use of autonomous time-lapse cameras combined with marking of individuals. We compared our results to data obtained from traditional monitoring methods used in the same colony. The phenology of their breeding cycle was the same as in other colonies of the SW Atlantic region. Although parents shared their chick rearing duties, females invested more time in incubating the eggs, while males were more dedicated to chick guarding. Chicks were more frequently fed by females, and males contributed only during the cr\u00e8che period. The effect of heat stress on chick survival was assessed, since uncommonly high air temperatures were reached during the study, causing unprecedented chick mass mortality. Temperatures of\u2009&gt;\u200925\u00b0 C were a lethal threshold for chicks; hence, the occurrence of several extremely hot days increased chick mortality. Our combined methodology was useful to evaluate phenology, parental investment, and the variables that affect reproductive success (for instance, weather conditions). We recommend its use in future comparative and long-term studies at remote rockhopper penguin colonies to help improve the quality of monitoring and detect potential threats of this vulnerable species.",

      "abstract": "Due to the rapid increase in cargoes and postal transport volumes in smart transportation systems, an efficient automated multidimensional terminal with autonomous elevating transfer vehicles (ETVs) should be established, and an effective cooperative scheduling strategy for vehicles needs to be designed for improving cargo handling efficiency. In this paper, as one of the most effective artificial intelligence technologies, the artificial bee colony algorithm (ABC), which possesses a strong global optimization ability and fewer parameters, is firstly introduced to simultaneously manage the autonomous ETVs and assign the corresponding entrances and exits. Moreover, as ABC has the disadvantage of slow convergence rate, a novel full-dimensional search strategy with parallelization (PfdABC) and a random multidimensional search strategy (RmdABC) are incorporated in the framework of ABC to increase the convergence speed. After being evaluated on benchmark functions, it is applied to solve the combinatorial optimization problem with multiple tasks and multiple entrances and exits in the terminal. The simulations show that the proposed algorithms can achieve a much more desired performance than the traditional artificial bee colony algorithm in terms of balancing the exploitation and exploration abilities, especially when dealing with the cooperative control and scheduling problems.",

      "abstract": "Robust understanding of the lane position and type is essential for changing lanes in autonomous vehicles. However, accomplishing this task in real time with high level of precision is not trivial. In this paper, we propose a novel cascaded deep neural network (DNet-CNet) for real-time end-to-end lane detection (DNet) and classification (CNet). The proposed model can simultaneously predict the lanes position and types. DNet integrates the spatial features extracted from the encoder with those from the decoder to compensate for the lower dimensional encoded data and edge information. Furthermore, the output of DNet is fused with the input image for real time lightweight lane classification model (CNet). The combined features exploit the inherent colors and shape of lanes to improve classification accuracy. Experimental results on the benchmark TuSimple, Caltech-lanes and ELAS datasets show that, the model proposed achieves superior lane detection and classification accuracy in real-time as compared to Cascade-CNN.",

      "abstract": "The increasing number of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) in low-altitude airspace is seriously threatening the safety of the urban environment. This paper proposes an adaptive collision avoidance method for multiple UAVs (mUAVs), aiming to provide a safe guidance for UAVs at risk of collision. The proposed method is formulated as a two\u2212layer resolution framework with the considerations of speed adjustment and rerouting strategies. The first layer is established as a deep reinforcement learning (DRL) model with a continuous state space and action space that adaptively selects the most suitable resolution strategy for UAV pairs. The second layer is developed as a collaborative mUAV collision avoidance model, which combines a three-dimensional conflict detection and conflict resolution pool to perform resolution. To train the DRL model, in this paper, a deep deterministic policy gradient (DDPG) algorithm is introduced and improved upon. The results demonstrate that the average time required to calculate a strategy is 0.096 s, the success rate reaches 95.03%, and the extra flight distance is 26.8 m, which meets the real-time requirements and provides a reliable reference for human intervention. The proposed method can adapt to various scenarios, e.g., different numbers and positions of UAVs, with interference from random factors. The improved DDPG algorithm can also significantly improve convergence speed and save training time.",

      "abstract": "Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS) are integrated systems that combine software and physical components. CPS has experienced rapid growth over the past decade in fields as disparate as telemedicine, smart manufacturing, autonomous vehicles, the Internet of Things, industrial control systems, smart power grids, remote laboratory environments, and many more. With the widespread integration of Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS) in various aspects of contemporary society, the frequency of malicious assaults carried out by adversaries has experienced a substantial surge in recent times. Incidents targeting vital civilian infrastructure, such as electrical power grids and oil pipelines, have become alarmingly common due to the expanded connectivity to the public internet, which significantly expands the vulnerability of CPS. This article presents a comprehensive review of existing literature that examines the latest advancements in anomaly detection techniques for identifying security threats in Cyber-Physical Systems. The primary emphasis is placed on addressing life safety concerns within industrial control networks (ICS). A total of 296 papers are reviewed, with common themes and research gaps identified. This paper makes a novel contribution by identifying the key challenges that remain in the field, which include resource constraints, a lack of standardized communication protocols, extreme heterogeneity that hampers industry consensus, and different information security priorities between Operational Technology (OT) and Information Technology (IT) networks. Potential solutions and/or opportunities for further research are identified to address these selected challenges.",

      "abstract": "Web robots are automated computer programs that can be exploited for benign and malicious activities such as website indexing, monitoring, or unauthorized content scraping and scalping. Several methods are available to detect automated web robots through their footprints and behaviors. Although the accuracy and efficiency of existing methods depend highly on the labeled web log data, countless web requests are generated daily with the help of web robots. Exhaustive and accurate manual labeling of reconstructed sessions is time-consuming and challenging. Further, effective detection of web robots is more challenging with unlabeled or partially labeled data. To address the aforementioned issues, we reformulated web robot detection as a semi-supervised learning problem. In this paper, we propose a deep learning-based Semi-Supervised Stacked Sparse AutoEncoder (Web-S4AE) for web robot detection. The proposed model uses content-based features and features extracted from web access log data to effectively classify web robots. The experiments were conducted on publicly available web log data from a library and information portal to assess the performance of Web-S4AE. The Web-S4AE model was trained in two phases. The first phase; comprises training the model with unlabeled data to extract the hidden information, and in the second phase, the model is fine-tuned using labeled data. The results suggest that incorporating more unlabeled data can significantly improve the classifier's performance. The Web-S4AE model\u2019s performance was also compared with other models such as the Decision Tree (DT), Random Forest (RF), eXtreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost), and Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP).",

      "abstract": "The use of information technology and the automation of control systems in the energy sector enables a more efficient transmission and distribution of electricity. However, in addition to the many benefits that the deployment of intelligent and largely autonomous systems brings, it also carries risks associated with information and cyber security breaches. Technology systems form a specific and critical communication infrastructure, in which powerful control elements integrating IoT principles and IED devices are present. It also contains intelligent access control systems such as RTU, IDE, HMI, and SCADA systems that provide communication with the data and control center on the outer perimeter. Therefore, the key question is how to comprehensively protect these specialized systems and how to approach security implementation projects in this area. To establish rules, procedures, and techniques to ensure the cyber security of smart grid control systems in the energy sector, it is necessary to understand the security threats and bring appropriate measures to ensure the security of energy distribution. Given the use of a wide range of information and industrial technologies, it is difficult to protect energy distribution systems using standard constraints to protect common IT technologies and business processes. Therefore, as part of a comprehensive approach to cyber security, specifics such as legislative framework, technological constraints, international standards, specialized protocols or company processes, and many others need to be considered. Therefore, the key question is how to comprehensively protect these specialized systems and how to approach security implementation projects in this area. In this article, a basic security concept for control systems of power stations, which are part of the power transmission and distribution system, is presented based on the Smart Grid domain model with emphasis on substation intelligence, according to the Purdue model. The main contribution of the paper is the comprehensive design of mitigation measures divided into mandatory and recommended implementation based on the standards defined within the MITRE ATT&CK matrix specified, concerning the specifications of intelligent distribution substations. The proposed and industry-tested solution is mapped to meet the international security standards ISO 27001 and national legislation reflecting the requirements of NIS2. This ensures that the security requirements will be met when implementing the proposed Security Baseline.",

An analysis of the experience of identifying vulnerabilities in the course of the joint design of the processor, computing module and computing complex was carried out. A number of actions have been developed and presented to ensure the control of hardware vulnerabilities in the development stage. The use of the binary translation technology of the Elbrus platform is proposed to prevent the execution of malicious software. A method has been developed to eliminate vulnerabilities in computer equipment for automated systems used for various purposes by using the Lintel binary translation system component. An experiment is described, the purpose of which was to successfully exploit the Meltdown vulnerability on a computer with an Elbrus processor. The experiment showed that, due to the peculiarities of the microarchitecture of Elbrus processors, the exploitation of Meltdown-type vulnerabilities is impossible.",

      "abstract": "<h3>Objectives</h3>\n<p>To analyse the prevalence of pathogenic variants in <i>DEPDC5</i>, <i>NPRL2</i> and <i>NPRL3</i> that encode the GATOR1 (GTPase-activating protein towards the Rags 1) complex, a modulator in the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) pathway, and to define the characteristics of GATOR1-associated epilepsy.</p><h3>Methods</h3>\n<p>Clinical details and whole-exome sequencing data of 170 novel probands with lesional or non-lesional epilepsy were retrieved. Candidate variants in GATOR1 genes were verified by Sanger sequencing, and cosegregate analysis was performed. The pathogenicity of variants and their effect on mTOR signalling were investigated.</p><h3>Results</h3>\n<p>Two novel frameshift variants and one recurrent nonsense variant were detected in <i>DEPDC5</i>, with a prevalence of 1.8% (3 out of 170) in the whole cohort and 3.1% (3 out of 97) in focal epilepsies. These variants cosegregated in pedigrees with epilepsy, respectively. Rare missense variants in <i>NPRL2</i> and <i>NPRL3</i> did not segregate with epilepsy in families, respectively. Epileptic phenotypes of 21 patients with <i>DEPDC5</i> variants showed focal seizures with non-lesional variable foci that were predominantly sleep-related, with a median onset age of 10 years (range 1\u201330). Seizure outcome was variable. About 24% of patients were drug-resistant, and seizure attacks were absent in 33% of variant carriers. Of 13 patients who experienced seizures, 54% tended to resolve spontaneously. Functional assessments showed that the three variants affected <i>DEPDC5</i> expression. These loss-of-function (LoF) variants affected the <i>DEPDC5</i>-dependent inhibition of mTOR.</p><h3>Conclusions</h3>\n<p>Patients carrying <i>DEPDC5</i>-LoF variants might show a high prevalence of focal seizures with a dynamic phenotype, indicating reduced penetrance and self-resolving features. The associated epilepsy was caused by loss of inhibition of the mTOR pathway. The pathogenicity of missense variants in GATOR1 genes should be cautiously evaluated.</p>",

      "abstract": "In this paper, we focus on the detection and localization of radioactive sources by exploiting supervised machine learning. Machine learning is utilized in a wide variety of applications due to its effectiveness in prediction and autonomous decision-making. However, applying machine learning would only be effective when representative features for the application can be acquired, through which learning algorithms can be trained. Hence, first, we present a feature extraction technique for radioactive source localization, and then propose a parameter estimation method via machine learning. A distributed sensor network is employed to assist in estimating the radioactive source\u2019s location and intensity. We propose a feature extraction method that evaluates a feature vector using the reading and position of each sensor located in a region where a radiation source is detected. The feature extraction is based on a data fusion process, where a single feature value is provided to represent both the reading value and position coordinates corresponding to a given sensor. After the feature extraction, we apply the decision tree machine learning method for regression to localize a radioactive source. To examine the effectiveness of the proposed work, a performance comparison is carried out with recent existing methods in terms of the estimation accuracy and the execution time. Experimental results show that the proposed algorithm provides accurate source intensity estimation and achieves a good compromise between localization accuracy and execution time.",

      "abstract": "Enabling technologies of Agriculture 4.0 such as IoT-driven Precision Agriculture (PA), Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs), and big data analytics are collaborating for the transformation of global agribusiness. In PA applications, IoT devices sense, collect, and transmit data to the cloud or edge for processing and processed data are stored in data centers. This exchange of a very large amount of information amongst billions of interconnected devices demands massive energy in PA applications. The growth of IoT devices is exponentially increasing directly or indirectly generating Green House Gases and causing energy deficiency in power-hungry IoT components like sensors. Thus, adopting green solutions is inevitable to promote energy-conserving, environment-friendly, and cost-effective IoT component designs. Inspired by achieving a green environment for IoT, we first give an overview of different data processing and energy-conserving strategies using machine learning, cloud computing, and edge computing. We then discuss and evaluate different Green IoT (GIoT) solutions that can be implemented for GIoT-based PA leveraging UAVs, Low Power Wide Area Networks (LPWANs), and 5G networks along with several implementation concerns. In addition, the sustainable progress towards Agriculture of 5.0 by integrating GIoT components is discussed to make the IoT greener using 5G networks and beyond. Based on the current survey, we have conceptualized a GIoT framework for designing energy-conserving, cost-effective, and environment-friendly PA applications while enabling ubiquitous connectivity. Finally, this paper systematically summarizes different security threats in GIoT layers and analyzes the measures that can be adopted to mitigate those threats in detail.",

      "abstract": "In order to identify and attack the multi-UUV (unmanned underwater vehicle) groups, this paper proposes a method for identifying the critical nodes of multi-UUV formations. This method helps in combating multi-UUV formations by identifying the key nodes to attack them. Moreover, these multi-UUV formations are considered to have an unknown structure as the research object. Therefore, the network structure of the formation is reconstructed according to its space\u2013time trajectory, and the importance of nodes is determined based on network structure entropy. As for the methodology, firstly, based on the swarm intelligence behavior method, the motion similarity of multi-UUV nodes in the formation is analyzed in pairs; furthermore, the leader\u2013follower relationship and the network structure of the formation are calculated successively. Then, based on this network structure, the importance of the network nodes is further determined by the network structure entropy method. Finally, through simulation and experiments, it is verified that the algorithm can accurately construct the network structure of the unknown multi-UUV formation, and the accuracy of the calculated time delay data reaches 84.6%, and compared with the traditional information entropy algorithm, the ordering of the important nodes obtained by this algorithm is more in line with the underwater formation network.",

      "abstract": "Pine wilt disease (PWD) is one of the most concerning diseases in forestry and poses a considerable threat to forests. Since the deep learning approach can interpret the raw images acquired by UAVs, it provides an effective means for forest health detection. However, the fact that only PWD can be detected but not the degree of infection can be evaluated hinders forest management, so it is necessary to establish an effective method to accurately detect PWD and extract regions infected by PWD. Therefore, a Mask R-CNN-based PWD detection and extraction algorithm is proposed in this paper. Firstly, the extraction of image features is improved by using the advanced ConvNeXt network. Then, it is proposed to change the original multi-scale structure to PA-FPN and normalize it by using GN and WS methods, which effectively enhances the data exchange between the bottom and top layers under low Batch-size training. Finally, a branch is added to the Mask module to improve the ability to extract objects using fusion. In addition, a PWD region extraction module is proposed in this paper for evaluating the damage caused by PWD. The experimental results show that the improved method proposed in this paper can achieve 91.9% recognition precision, 90.2% mapping precision, and 89.3% recognition rate of the affected regions on the PWD dataset. It can effectively identify the distribution of diseased pine trees and calculate the damage proportion in a relatively accurate way to facilitate the management of forests.",

      "abstract": "The fuzzy vault is an innovative way to share secret keys, combining traditional cryptography with biometrics and biometric template protection. This method forms the basis for the reliable operation of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) through anonymizing drone operators and safely using their data and onboard information. However, due to the inherent instability of biometrics, traditional fuzzy vault schemes face challenges, such as reduced recognition rates with increased chaff points, impractical runtimes due to high-order polynomial reconstruction, and susceptibility to correlation attacks. This paper proposes an efficient fuzzy vault scheme to address these challenges. We generate two secret keys based on biometrics: the first key is produced from the operator\u2019s unique features like the face and iris, using a confidence interval; the second key, used to construct a polynomial, is based on what the operator remembers. These dual-key fuzzy vaults enable the stable generation of genuine points during encoding, easy extraction during decoding, and effective operator authentication while maintaining anonymity. Our experimental results demonstrate improved security and secret acquisition accuracy using the AR face database. These results are achieved regardless of increased false vaults, enabling real-time polynomial reconstruction and resilience against correlation attacks. Importantly, our enhanced fuzzy vault scheme allows the application of this secure, real-time authentication process, safeguarding the anonymity of drone operators.",

      "abstract": "Cardiovascular disorders are often diagnosed using an electrocardiogram (ECG). It is a painless method that mimics the cyclical contraction and relaxation of the heart\u2019s muscles. By monitoring the heart\u2019s electrical activity, an ECG can be used to identify irregular heartbeats, heart attacks, cardiac illnesses, or enlarged hearts. Numerous studies and analyses of ECG signals to identify cardiac problems have been conducted during the past few years. Although ECG heartbeat classification methods have been presented in the literature, especially for unbalanced datasets, they have not proven to be successful in recognizing some heartbeat categories with high performance. This study uses a convolutional neural network (CNN) model to combine the benefits of dense and residual blocks. The objective is to leverage the benefits of residual and dense connections to enhance information flow, gradient propagation, and feature reuse, ultimately improving the model\u2019s performance. This proposed model consists of a series of residual-dense blocks interleaved with optional pooling layers for downsampling. A linear support vector machine (LSVM) classified heartbeats into five classes. This makes it easier to learn and represent features from ECG signals. We first denoised the gathered ECG data to correct issues such as baseline drift, power line interference, and motion noise. The impacts of the class imbalance are then offset by resampling techniques that denoise ECG signals. An RD-CNN algorithm is then used to categorize the ECG data for the various cardiac illnesses using the retrieved characteristics. On two benchmarked datasets, we conducted extensive simulations and assessed several performance measures. On average, we have achieved an accuracy of 98.5%, a sensitivity of 97.6%, a specificity of 96.8%, and an area under the receiver operating curve (AUC) of 0.99. The effectiveness of our suggested method for detecting heart disease from ECG data was compared with several recently presented algorithms. The results demonstrate that our method is lightweight and practical, qualifying it for continuous monitoring applications in clinical settings for automated ECG interpretation to support cardiologists.",

      "abstract": "As resources provided by single unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) are limited, we propose a cross-platform UAV swarm key management scheme for task scenarios in denied environments. In denied environments where the communication link is open and the UAV nodes may go invalid, secure communication is often at stake. To solve this problem, we propose a key management scheme which, based on the Chinese remainder theorem (CRT) and the Hash function, constructs a swarm key by combining the local key and the session key to reduce the overhead of individual UAV nodes in the swarm. Meanwhile, the swarm head node constructs broadcast messages according to the key update needs, which reduces the overhead of the member nodes, improves the efficiency of key updating, and fulfills the key establishment and updating of the UAV swarm. Experiments show that our proposed scheme has forward and backward security and can defend against collusion attacks and replay attacks; our method was compared with other methods on the MIRACL cryptographic library in Visual Studio 2019, and it was found that our method has a lower computing and communication overhead, provides a solution to cross-platform key management of UAV swarms in denied environments, and ensures safe communication of UAVs in the swarm.",

      "abstract": "Uncertain environment on multi-lane highway, e.g., the stochastic lane-change maneuver of surrounding vehicles, is a big challenge for achieving safe automated highway driving. To improve the driving safety, a heuristic reinforcement learning decision-making framework with integrated risk assessment is proposed. First, the framework includes a long short-term memory model to predict the trajectory of surrounding vehicles and a future integrated risk assessment model to estimate the possible driving risk. Second, a heuristic decaying state entropy deep reinforcement learning algorithm is introduced to address the exploration and exploitation dilemma of reinforcement learning. Finally, the framework also includes a rule-based vehicle decision model for interaction decision problems with surrounding vehicles. The proposed framework is validated in both low-density and high-density traffic scenarios. The results show that the traffic efficiency and vehicle safety are both improved compared to the common dueling double deep Q-Network method and rule-based method.",

      "abstract": "Thousands of tonnes of litter enter the ocean every day, posing a significant threat to marine life and ecosystems. While floating and beach litter are often in the spotlight, about 70% of marine litter eventually sinks to the seafloor, making underwater litter the largest accumulation of marine litter that often goes undetected. Plastic debris makes up the majority of ocean litter and is a known source of microplastics in the ocean. This paper focuses on the detection of ocean plastic using neural network models. Two neural network models will be trained, i.e., YOLACT and the Mask R-CNN, for the instance segmentation of underwater litter in images. The models are trained on the TrashCAN dataset, using pre-trained model weights trained using COCO. The trained neural network could achieve a mean average precision (mAP) of 0.377 and 0.365 for the Mask R-CNN and YOLACT, respectively. The lightweight nature of YOLACT allows it to detect images at up to six times the speed of the Mask R-CNN, while only making a comparatively smaller trade-off in terms of performance. This allows for two separate applications: YOLACT for the collection of litter using autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs) and the Mask R-CNN for surveying litter distribution.",

We successfully used these compact UV-C LED arrays for long lasting irradiation tests aimed at generating the biosynthesis of defensive metabolites that enhance the resistance of plants and fruits to pathogen attacks. Finally, we comment on the possibility of implementing these compact UV-C sources on robotic systems to make an automated device suitable to reduce pesticide use in agricultural crops.",

      "abstract": "Maneuver decision-making is essential for autonomous air combat. However, previous methods usually make decisions to aim at the target instead of hitting the target and use discrete action spaces instead of continuous action spaces. While these simplifications make maneuver decision-making easier, they also make maneuver decision-making more unrealistic. Meanwhile, previous studies usually rely on handcrafted reward functions, which are troublesome to design. Therefore, to solve these problems, we propose an automatic curriculum reinforcement learning method that enables agents to maneuver effectively in air combat from scratch. On the basis of curriculum reinforcement learning, maneuver decision-making is divided into a series of sub-tasks from easy to difficult. Thus, agents can gradually learn how to complete a series of sub-tasks, from easy to difficult without handcrafted reward functions. The ablation studies show that automatic curriculum learning is essential for reinforcement learning; namely, agents cannot make effective decisions without curriculum learning. Simulations show that, after training, agents are able to make effective decisions given different states, including tracking, attacking, and escaping, which are both rational and interpretable.",

      "abstract": "Machine perception uses advanced sensors to collect information about the surrounding scene for situational awareness1\u20137. State-of-the-art machine perception8 using active sonar, radar and LiDAR to enhance camera vision9 faces difficulties when the number of intelligent agents scales up10,11. Exploiting omnipresent heat signal could be a new frontier for scalable perception. However, objects and their environment constantly emit and scatter thermal radiation, leading to textureless images famously known as the \u2018ghosting effect\u201912. Thermal vision thus has no specificity limited by information loss, whereas thermal ranging\u2014crucial for navigation\u2014has been elusive even when combined with artificial intelligence (AI)13. Here we propose and experimentally demonstrate heat-assisted detection and ranging (HADAR) overcoming this open challenge of ghosting and benchmark it against AI-enhanced thermal sensing. HADAR not only sees texture and depth through the darkness as if it were day but also perceives decluttered physical attributes beyond RGB or thermal vision, paving the way to fully passive and physics-aware machine perception. We develop HADAR estimation theory and address its photonic shot-noise limits depicting information-theoretic bounds to HADAR-based AI performance. HADAR ranging at night beats thermal ranging and shows an accuracy comparable with RGB stereovision in daylight. Our automated HADAR thermography reaches the Cram\u00e9r\u2013Rao bound on temperature accuracy, beating existing thermography techniques. Our work leads to a disruptive technology that can accelerate the Fourth Industrial Revolution (Industry 4.0)14 with HADAR-based autonomous navigation and human\u2013robot social interactions. Heat-assisted detection and ranging is experimentally shown to see texture and depth through darkness as if it were day, and also perceives decluttered physical attributes beyond RGB or thermal vision.",

      "abstract": "The global population status of many reptiles, particularly tortoises as one of the most threatened tetrapod groups, necessitates conservation efforts and study. Baseline information about habitat use can help formulate conservation strategies and improve effectiveness of surveys. I studied habitat use by Karoo Dwarf Tortoises (Chersobius boulengeri), an endangered South African endemic with only one population known to contain males, females, and juveniles, to aid conservationists in assessing which nature reserves (with incidental records) and potential new reserves may sustain populations, and to inform surveys for additional populations. Available microhabitats and rock types were mapped using an unmanned aerial vehicle. I analyzed the tortoise distribution and determined home range sizes (minimum convex polygons) and minimum daily movement distances of nine males and 16 females using radio transmitters. All fieldwork was conducted in spring 2018 and 2019, and in summer 2018, 2019, and 2020. Relatively high numbers of tortoises inhabited sills (i.e., exposed dolerite intrusions between sandstone) that contained ample retreats among boulders and rocks, whereas relatively few lived on level plateaus that might expose them to predatory birds. Despite their apparent preference of sills, tortoises were able to survive in home ranges that contained little sill microhabitat. Tortoises were rather sedentary, having small sexually and seasonally similar home ranges (1.10\u20131.14 ha) and movement distances (27.6\u201328.4 m/day), although their home ranges were larger than those of the related Speckled Dwarf Tortoise (Chersobius signatus), possibly as a result of different habitat productivities. Conservationists and surveyors should consider that sills appear important for Karoo Dwarf Tortoises, but generic rocky slopes may also harbor individuals. Future studies could address aspects that underlie microhabitat use, such as availability of retreats and vegetation, and integrate available information in a spatial model.",

      "abstract": "As the 6LoWPAN devices in the Internet of Things (IoT) applications communicate sensitive information over the unattended and insecure channel, it is essential to design suitable authentication methods for such devices. Due to high computation and communication overheads, the traditional certificate-based authentication schemes are predominantly considered impractical for resource-constraint 6LoWPAN devices used in IoT applications. However, a certificate with some lightweight features makes the authentication feasible in those resource-constraint 6LoWPAN devices. This paper proposes a lightweight certificate-based authentication scheme based on cryptographic hash operation and elliptic curve digital signature algorithm. It can mitigate several security threats, including replay, man-in-the-middle, impersonation, malicious device deployment, and spoofing attacks. The automated validation of Internet security protocols and applications (AVISPA) verification tool is used to formally verify the security of the proposed scheme against several known attacks. In addition, the correctness of the authentication scheme is verified using the widely accepted BAN logic. Moreover, a comparative analysis among the proposed and other well-established relevant schemes is carried out in order to figure out the trade-off considering not only the functionality attributes and security but also the involved computation and communication costs.",

      "abstract": "Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV) play a vital role in many fields, such as agricultural planting, security patrol, emergency rescue, and so on. The development and implementation of these devices have become vital in terms of reachability and usability. Unfortunately, as drones become more widely used in various fields, they become more and more vulnerable to attacks and security threats, including, but not limited to, eavesdropping, man-in-the-middle attacks, and known session key attacks. In order to deal with these attacks and security threats and meet the needs of lightweight UAV communication, a secure and efficient authentication scheme is essential. To meet the security and lightweight requirements of an identity authentication scheme in a UAV communication network, this paper proposes an identity authentication scheme sdronelig based on an elliptic curve cryptosystem. The scheme realizes the mutual authentication and session key agreement configuration between the UAV and the ground station, and the authentication and key agreement between the UAVs can be realized with the help of the control station. The sdronelig authentication scheme is based on the ECDH key exchange protocol in the elliptic curve cryptography algorithm and adopts the MAC message authentication code technology and the method of pre-calculating part of the process. Under the premise of ensuring the security of the UAV communication network, the authentication efficiency is improved, the communication overhead and communication times are reduced, and the lightweight requirement of the UAV authentication scheme is met. Additionally, a formal verification tool is used to verify the security of the sdronelig scheme under the Dolev-Yao threat model, which is suitable for UAV networks. Finally, a detailed comparative study was conducted on security features, communication overhead, the number of communications, and computational overhead. The results show that the proposed sdronelig authentication scheme not only provides superior security features but also has better or comparable overhead compared to other existing authentication schemes.",

      "abstract": "DC microgrids are highly compatible with photovoltaic (PV) generation because of their direct-current properties. However, with the increasing integration of PV sources into DC microgrids, traditional maximum power point tracking (MPPT) algorithms may cause problems such as overvoltage and power fluctuation, which makes it challenging to keep the stability of the DC-bus voltage due to the intermittent and stochastic nature of PVs. Consequently, in order to reduce the investment and maintenance costs of storage systems, innovative control methods are required for PVs to provide DC-bus voltage regulation services. In this paper, a novel active power control (APC) strategy, based on characteristic curve fitting, is proposed to flexibly regulate the PV output power. The transient process performance and robustness of the system are improved with the proposed APC strategy. Based on it, a V-P droop mechanism is designed to provide voltage regulating (DVR) service for the DC microgrid. The overall control strategy unifies the DVR function with the traditional MPPT function in the same control structure; thus, the PV source either works in the MPPT mode if the DC-bus is at its nominal value, or it works in the DVR mode if the DC-bus exceeds it. Switching between MPPT and DVR is autonomous, and it is fully decentralized, which improves the PV generation efficiency as well as ensures generation fairness among different parallel PV sources. Case studies including a real-world project analysis are carried out to validate the feasibility and effectiveness of the proposed strategy.",

Transition toward Agriculture 4.0 is expected to enhance agricultural productivity through the integration of advanced technologies, increase resource efficiency, ensure long-term food security by applying more sustainable farming practices, and enhance resilience and climate change adaptation. By integrating technologies such as ground IoT sensing and remote sensing, via both satellite and Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs), and exploiting data fusion and data analytics, farming can make the transition to a more efficient, productive, and sustainable paradigm. The present work performs a systematic literature review (SLR), identifying the challenges associated with UAV, Satellite, and Ground Sensing in their application in agriculture, comparing them and discussing their complementary use to facilitate Precision Agriculture (PA) and transition to Agriculture 4.0.",

      "abstract": "Agricultural terraces are important artificial landforms on the Loess Plateau of China and have many ecosystem services (e.g., agricultural production, soil and water conservation). Due to the loss of rural labor, a large number of agricultural terraces have been abandoned and then the degradation of terraces, caused by rainstorm and lack of management, threatens the sustainability of ecological services on terraces. Our previous study has found its geomorphological evidence (sinkhole and collapse). However, no quantitative indicators of terrace degradation are identified from the perspective of microtopography change. A framework for quantifying terrace degradation was established in this study based on unmanned aerial vehicle photogrammetry and digital topographic analysis. The Pujiawa terraces in the Loess Plateau were selected as study areas. Firstly, the terrace ridges were extracted by a Canny edge detector based on high-resolution digital elevation model (DEM) data. The adaptive method was used to calculate the low and high thresholds automatically. This method ensures the low complexity and high-edge continuity and accuracy of the Canny edge detector, which is superior to the manual setting and maximum inter-class variance (Otsu) method. Secondly, the DEMs of the terrace slope before degradation were rebuilt through the terrain analysis method based on the extracted terrace ridges and current DEM data. Finally, the degradation of terraces was quantified by the index series in the line, surface and volume aspects, which are the damage degrees of the terrace ridges, terrace surface and whole terrace. The damage degrees of the terrace ridges were calculated according to the extracted and generalised terrace ridges. The damage degrees of the terrace surface and whole terrace were calculated based on the differences of DEMs before and after degradation. The proposed indices and quantitative methods for evaluating agricultural terrace degradation reflect the erosion status of the terraces in topography. This work provides data and references for loess terrace landscape protection and its sustainable management.",

      "abstract": "The productivity of wheat in the Mediterranean region is under threat due to climate-change-related environmental factors, including fungal diseases that can negatively impact wheat yield and quality. Wheat phenotyping tools utilizing affordable, high-throughput plant phenotyping (HTPP) techniques, such as aerial and ground RGB images and quick canopy and leaf sensors, can aid in assessing crop status and selecting tolerant wheat varieties. This study focused on the impact of fungal diseases on wheat productivity in the Mediterranean region, considering the need for a precise selection of tolerant wheat varieties. This research examined the use of affordable HTPP methods, including imaging and active multispectral sensors, to aid in crop management for improved wheat health and to support commercial field phenotyping programs. This study evaluated 40 advanced lines of bread wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) at five locations across northern Spain, comparing fungicide-treated and untreated blocks under fungal disease pressure (Septoria, brown rust, and stripe rust observed). Measurements of leaf-level pigments and canopy vegetation indexes were taken using portable sensors, field cameras, and imaging sensors mounted on unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs). Significant differences were observed in Dualex flavonoids and the nitrogen balance index (NBI) between treatments in some locations (p < 0.001 between Elorz and Ejea). Measurements of canopy vigor and color at the plot level showed significant differences between treatments at all sites, highlighting indexes such as the green area (GA), crop senescence index (CSI), and triangular greenness index (TGI) in assessing the effects of fungicide treatments on different wheat cultivars. RGB vegetation indexes from the ground and UAV were highly correlated (r = 0.817 and r = 0.810 for TGI and NGRDI). However, the Greenseeker NDVI sensor was found to be more effective in estimating grain yield and protein content (R2 = 0.61\u20130.7 and R2 = 0.45\u20130.55, respectively) compared to the aerial AgroCam GEO NDVI (R2 = 0.25\u20130.35 and R2 = 0.12\u20130.21, respectively). We suggest as a practical consideration the use of the GreenSeeker NDVI as more user-friendly and less affected by external environmental factors. This study emphasized the throughput benefits of RGB UAV HTPPs with the high similarity between ground and aerial results and highlighted the potential for HTPPs in supporting the selection of fungal-disease-resistant bread wheat varieties.",

      "abstract": "Reinforcement learning is one of the most important branches of AI. Due to its capacity for self-adaption and decision-making in dynamic environments, reinforcement learning has been widely applied in multiple areas, such as healthcare, data markets, autonomous driving, and robotics. However, some of these applications and systems have been shown to be vulnerable to security or privacy attacks, resulting in unreliable or unstable services. A large number of studies have focused on these security and privacy problems in reinforcement learning. However, few surveys have provided a systematic review and comparison of existing problems and state-of-the-art solutions to keep up with the pace of emerging threats. Accordingly, we herein present such a comprehensive review to explain and summarize the challenges associated with security and privacy in reinforcement learning from a new perspective, namely that of the Markov Decision Process (MDP). In this survey, we first introduce the key concepts related to this area. Next, we cover the security and privacy issues linked to the state, action, environment, and reward function of the MDP process, respectively. We further highlight the special characteristics of security and privacy methodologies related to reinforcement learning. Finally, we discuss the possible future research directions within this area.",

      "abstract": "The unprecedented COVID-19 pandemic posed major challenges to local, regional, and global economies and health systems, and fast clinical diagnostic workflows were urgently needed to contain the spread of SARS-CoV-2. Here, we describe the platform and workflow established at the Cornell COVID-19 Testing Laboratory (CCTL) for the high-throughput testing of clinical samples from the university and the surrounding community. This workflow enabled efficient and rapid detection and the successful control of SARS-CoV-2 infection on campus and its surrounding communities. Our cost-effective and fully automated workflow enabled the testing of over 8000 pooled samples per day and provided results for over 2 million samples. The automation of time- and effort-intensive sample processing steps such as accessioning and pooling increased laboratory efficiency. Customized software applications were developed to track and store samples, deconvolute positive pools, track and report results, and for workflow integration from sample receipt to result reporting. Additionally, quality control dashboards and turnaround-time tracking applications were built to monitor assay and laboratory performance. As infectious disease outbreaks pose a constant threat to both human and animal health, the highly effective workflow implemented at CCTL could be modeled to establish regional high-capacity testing hubs for infectious disease preparedness and emergency response.",

      "abstract": "Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), known as drones, have played a significant role in recent years in creating resilient smart cities. UAVs can be used for a wide range of applications, including emergency response, civil protection, search and rescue, and surveillance, thanks to their high mobility and reasonable price. Automatic recognition of human activity in aerial videos captured by drones is critical for various tasks for these applications. However, this is difficult due to many factors specific to aerial views, including camera motion, vibration, low resolution, background clutter, lighting conditions, and variations in view. Although deep learning approaches have demonstrated their effectiveness in a variety of challenging vision tasks, they require either a large number of labelled aerial videos for training or a dataset with balanced classes, both of which can be difficult to obtain. To address these challenges, a hybrid data augmentation method is proposed which combines data transformation with the Wasserstein Generative Adversarial Network (GAN)-based feature augmentation method. In particular, we apply the basic transformation methods to increase the amount of video in the database. A Convolutional Neural Network\u2013Long Short-Term Memory (CNN-LSTM) model is used to learn the spatio-temporal dynamics of actions, then a GAN-based technique is applied to generate synthetic CNN-LSTM features conditioned on action classes which provide a high discriminative spatio-temporal features. We tested our model on the YouTube aerial database, demonstrating encouraging results that surpass those of previous state-of-the-art works, including an accuracy rate of 97.83%.",

      "abstract": "The complement system is a recognized pillar of host defence against infection and noxious self-derived antigens. Complement is traditionally known as a serum-effective system, whereby the liver expresses and secretes most complement components, which participate in the detection of bloodborne pathogens and drive an inflammatory reaction&nbsp;to safely remove the microbial or antigenic threat. However, perturbations in normal complement function can cause severe disease and, for reasons that are currently not fully understood, the kidney is&nbsp;particularly vulnerable to dysregulated complement activity. Novel insights into complement biology have identified cell-autonomous and intracellularly active complement \u2014 the complosome \u2014 as an unexpected central orchestrator of normal cell physiology. For example, the&nbsp;complosome controls mitochondrial activity, glycolysis, oxidative phosphorylation, cell survival and gene regulation in innate and adaptive immune cells, and in non-immune cells, such as fibroblasts and endothelial and epithelial cells. These unanticipated complosome contributions to basic cell physiological pathways make it a novel and central player in the control of cell homeostasis and effector responses. This discovery, together with the realization that an increasing number of human diseases involve complement perturbations, has renewed interest in the complement system and its therapeutic targeting. Here, we summarize the current knowledge about the complosome across healthy cells and tissues, highlight contributions from dysregulated complosome activities to human disease and discuss potential therapeutic implications. Complement proteins and receptors with intracellular activity \u2014 the complosome \u2014 have emerged as important regulators of physiological processes. In this Review, the authors examine evidence of complosome activity across a variety of cells and tissues, as well as their contributions to human disease and therapeutic potential.",

      "abstract": "Mangrove forests provide valuable ecosystem services to coastal communities across tropical and subtropical regions. Current anthropogenic stressors threaten these ecosystems and urge researchers to create improved monitoring methods for better environmental management. Recent efforts that have focused on automatically quantifying the above-ground biomass using image analysis have found some success on high resolution imagery of mangrove forests that have sparse vegetation. In this study, we focus on stands of mangrove forests with dense vegetation consisting of the endemic Pelliciera rhizophorae and the more widespread Rhizophora mangle mangrove species located in the remote Utr\u00eda National Park in the Colombian Pacific coast. Our developed workflow used consumer-grade Unoccupied Aerial System (UAS) imagery of the mangrove forests, from which large orthophoto mosaics and digital surface models are built. We apply convolutional neural networks (CNNs) for instance segmentation to accurately delineate (33% instance average precision) individual tree canopies for the Pelliciera rhizophorae species. We also apply CNNs for semantic segmentation to accurately identify (97% precision and 87% recall) the area coverage of the Rhizophora mangle mangrove tree species as well as the area coverage of surrounding mud and water land-cover classes. We provide a novel algorithm for merging predicted instance segmentation tiles of trees to recover tree shapes and sizes in overlapping border regions of tiles. Using the automatically segmented ground areas we interpolate their height from the digital surface model to generate a digital elevation model, significantly reducing the effort for ground pixel selection. Finally, we calculate a canopy height model from the digital surface and elevation models and combine it with the inventory of Pelliciera rhizophorae trees to derive the height of each individual mangrove tree. The resulting inventory of a mangrove forest, with individual P. rhizophorae tree height information, as well as crown shape and size descriptions, enables the use of allometric equations to calculate important monitoring metrics, such as above-ground biomass and carbon stocks.",

      "abstract": "The assessment of multiple incoming autonomous underwater vehicles (multi-AUVs) and threat prioritization are critical to underwater defense. To solve problems troubling multi-AUV threat assessment solutions, such as difficult data analysis, high subjectivity, and rigid prioritization logic, we propose the PROMETHEE algorithm based on fusion weights calculated twice by entropy and an analytic network process (ANP), respectively. First, according to AUV detection performance and underwater confrontation situation analysis, the main criteria and indicators of threat assessment are determined. The threat assessment system is provided by unified measurement of these indicators. Then, through analysis and assessment, the weighting algorithm is designed using entropy and ANP. The subjective weight calculated based on ANP and the objective weight obtained based on the entropy method are fused twice to obtain the combined weights, and the influence of subjective and objective factors on problem analysis is considered. Finally, by analyzing the simulation results of a multi-AUV, it is proven that the proposed algorithm is scientific and effective for AUV threat assessment. According to the experimental results, accurate evaluation of the target improved by at least 10%, enabling delivery of results close to the real confrontation situation with high reliability.",

      "abstract": "The paper presents a low-cost and LiDAR-free approach to efficiently detect 3D objects from stereo camera images, towards autonomous driving applications. It is first proposed to exploit the simple linear iterative clustering algorithm to segment stereo images into superpixel feature maps. The segmented superpixel maps are then used to estimate a depth map. By utilizing the depth map and stereo images, a 3D point cloud can be generated; and the 3D data is considered as pseudo-LiDAR representation as it is similar to measurements collected by a LiDAR sensor. The generated pseudo-LiDAR point cloud can ultimately be fed into any the state-of-the-art LiDAR based 3D object detection techniques to localize objects. By doing this, the proposed approach can effectively detect 3D objects by only employing low-cost stereo cameras, which can save tens of thousands of dollars on LiDAR costs from the existing LiDAR based methods. Effectiveness of the proposed algorithm was evaluated in the real-world KITTI dataset where the obtained results are about 1.33% better than those obtained by the benchmarking pseudo-LiDAR++ method (You et al. 2020).",

      "abstract": "The small UAV (unmanned aerial vehicle) cluster has become an important trend in the development of UAVs because it has the advantages of being unmanned, having a small size and low cost, and ability to complete many collaborative tasks. Meanwhile, the problem of GPS spoofing attacks faced by submachines has become an urgent security problem for the UAV cluster. In this paper, a GPS-adaptive spoofing detection (ASD) method based on UAV cluster cooperative positioning is proposed to solve the above problem. The specific technical scheme mainly includes two detection mechanisms: the GPS spoofing signal detection (SSD) mechanism based on cluster cooperative positioning and the relative security machine optimal marking (RSOM) mechanism. The SSD mechanism starts when the cluster enters the task state, and it can detect all threats to the cluster caused by one GPS signal spoofing source in the task environment; when the function range of the mechanism is exceeded, that is, there is more than one spoofing source and more than one UAV is attacked by different spoofing sources, the RSOM mechanism is triggered. The ASD algorithm proposed in this work can detect spoofing in a variety of complex GPS spoofing threat environments and is able to ensure the cluster formation and task completion. Moreover, it has the advantages of a lightweight calculation level, strong applicability, and high real-time performance.",

      "abstract": "Landslides are a destructive natural phenomenon that can cause significant damage to landscapes, infrastructure, and human lives around the world. The Himalayas, with their active tectonics and varied climatic conditions, are particularly susceptible to landslide hazards. The Danna\u2013Sahotar Landslide in the district of Muzaffarabad, Pakistan, is a prime example of this. Triggered by prolonged rainfall in April 2016, this mass movement caused extensive damage to the area's infrastructure and continues to pose a threat to nearby settlements. To better understand the nature of the Danna\u2013Sahotar Landslide, an integrated approach was used, combining unmanned aerial vehicle photogrammetry and electrical resistivity tomography (ERT) techniques. High-resolution orthomosaic and digital surface model were generated with a spatial resolution of 3&nbsp;cm/pixel and 6.14&nbsp;cm/pixel, respectively. These data were then used to analyze the geological, geomorphological, and geometric characteristics of the landslide. The results of this study reveal that the Danna\u2013Sahotar Landslide has multiple failure mechanisms, making it a complex and active mass movement. The ERT results indicate that the sliding mass of the landslide primarily consists of moisture-induced colluvium and debris, which leads to low resistivity in resistivity tomograms. The moisture content of the slope-forming material is a significant contributor to the instability of the landslide. Additionally, a well-developed linear to curvilinear slip surface between the unconsolidated sliding mass and bedrock was identified based on resistivity contrast. In conclusion, this study highlights that, in addition to active tectonics, the hydrogeology of the slope-forming mass is a major factor in reducing the stability of the Danna\u2013Sahotar Landslide. The results of this integrated study can be used to develop effective mitigation measures to prevent future catastrophe.",

      "abstract": "Intelligent vehicular cyber-physical systems (ICPSs) increase the reliability, efficiency and adaptability of urban mobility systems. Notably, ICPSs enable autonomous transportation in smart cities, exemplified by the emerging fields of self-driving cars and advanced air mobility. Nonetheless, the deployment of ICPSs raises legitimate concerns surrounding safety assurance, cybersecurity threats, communication reliability, and data management. Addressing these issues often necessitates specialised platforms to cater to the heterogeneity and complexity of ICPSs. To address this challenge, this paper presents a comprehensive CPS to explore, develop and test ICPSs and intelligent vehicular algorithms. A customisable embedded system is realised using a field programmable gate array, which is connected to a supervisory computer to enable networked operations and support advanced multi-agent algorithms. The platform remains compatible with multiple vehicular sensors, communication protocols and human\u2013machine interfaces, essential for a vehicle to perceive its surroundings, communicate with collaborative systems, and interact with its occupants. The proposed CPS thereby offers a practical resource to advance ICPS development, comprehension, and experimentation in both educational and research settings. By bridging the gap between theory and practice, this tool empowers users to overcome the complexities of ICPSs and contribute to the emerging fields of autonomous transportation and intelligent vehicular systems.",

      "abstract": "The combination of a single-photon avalanche diode detector with a high-sensitivity and photon-efficient reconstruction algorithm can realize the reconstruction of target range image from weak light signal conditions. The limited spatial resolution of the detector and the substantial background noise remain significant challenges in the actual detection process, hindering the accuracy of 3D reconstruction techniques. To address this challenge, this paper proposes a denoising super-resolution reconstruction network based on generative adversarial network (GAN) design. Soft thresholding is incorporated into the deep architecture as a nonlinear transformation layer to effectively filter out noise. Moreover, the Unet-based discriminator is introduced to complete the high-precision detail reconstruction. The experimental results show that the proposed network can achieve high-quality super-resolution range imaging. This approach has the potential to enhance the accuracy and quality of long-range imaging in weak light signal conditions, with broad applications in fields such as robotics, autonomous vehicles, and biomedical imaging.",

      "abstract": "Cracks on concrete surface are typically clear warning signs of a potential threat to the integrity and serviceability of structure. The techniques based on image processing can effectively detect the cracks from images. These techniques, however, are generally susceptible to user-driven heuristic thresholds and extraneous distractors. Inspired by recent success of artificial intelligence, a deep learning based automated crack detection system called CrackSN was developed. An image dataset of concrete surface is collected by smartphone and carefully prepared in order to develop and train the CrackSN system. This proposed deep learning model, built on the Adam-SqueezeNet architecture, automatically learns the discriminative feature directly from the labeled and augmented patches. Hyperparameters of SqueezeNet are tuned with Adam optimization additive through the training and validation procedures. The fine-tuned CrackSN model outperforms state-of-the-art models in recent literature by correctly classifying 97.3% of the cracked patches in the image dataset. The success of CrackSN model demonstrated with light network design and outstanding performance provides a key step toward automated damage inspection and health evaluation for infrastructure.\r\n&nbsp;",

      "abstract": "As the digital economy grows rapidly around the world, how would it impact carbon emissions? This paper discusses this issue from the perspective of heterogeneous innovation. Based on the panel data of 284 cities in China from 2011 to 2020, this paper empirically examines the impact of the digital economy on carbon emissions as well as the mediating and threshold effects of different innovation modes. The study finds that the digital economy can significantly reduce carbon emissions; this conclusion holds after a series of robustness tests. Independent innovation and imitative innovation are important channels through which the digital economy affects carbon emissions, but technological introduction is not an effective way. For regions with high levels of financial investment in science and innovative talents, the reduction in carbon emissions from the digital economy is more significant. Further research shows that the effect of the digital economy on carbon emissions has a threshold feature, with an inverted U-shaped relationship between the two, and that an increase in autonomous innovation and imitation innovation can enhance the digital economy\u2019s carbon reduction effect. Therefore, it is necessary to strengthen the capacity of independent innovation and imitation innovation to exploit the carbon-cutting effect of the digital economy.",

      "abstract": "On the one hand, the Internet of Medical Things (IoMT) in healthcare systems has emerged as a promising technology to monitor patients\u2019 health and provide reliable medical services, especially in remote and underserved areas. On the other hand, in disaster scenarios, the loss of communication infrastructure can make it challenging to establish reliable communication and to provide timely first aid services. To address this challenge, unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) have been adopted to assist hospital centers in delivering medical care to hard-to-reach areas. Despite the potential of UAVs to improve medical services in emergency scenarios, their limited resources make their security critical. Therefore, developing secure and efficient communication protocols for IoMT networks using UAVs is a vital research area that can help ensure reliable and timely medical services. In this paper, we introduce a novel Stackelberg security-based game theory algorithm, named Stackelberg ad hoc on-demand distance vector (SBAODV), to detect and recover data affected by black hole attacks in IoMT networks using UAVs. Our proposed scheme utilizes the substantial Stackelberg equilibrium (SSE) to formulate strategies that protect the system against attacks. We evaluate the performance of our proposed SBAODV scheme and compare it with existing routing schemes. Our results demonstrate that our proposed scheme outperforms existing schemes regarding packet delivery ratio (PDR), networking load, throughput, detection ratio, and end-to-end delay. Specifically, our proposed SBAODV protocol achieves a PDR of 97%, throughput ranging from 77.7 kbps to 87.3 kbps, and up to 95% malicious detection rate at the highest number of nodes. Furthermore, our proposed SBADOV scheme offers significantly lower networking load (7% to 30%) and end-to-end delay (up to 30%) compared to existing routing schemes. These results demonstrate the efficiency and effectiveness of our proposed scheme in ensuring reliable and secure communication in IoMT emergency scenarios using UAVs.",

      "abstract": "During the operation of agricultural unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) in orchards, the presence of power poles and wires pose a serious threat to flight safety, and can even lead to crashes. Due to the difficulty of directly detecting wires, this research aimed to quickly and accurately detect wire poles, and proposed an improved Yolov5s deep learning object detection algorithm named Yolov5s-Pole. The algorithm enhances the model\u2019s generalization ability and robustness by applying Mixup data augmentation technique, replaces the C3 module with the GhostBottleneck module to reduce the model\u2019s parameters and computational complexity, and incorporates the Shuffle Attention (SA) module to improve its focus on small targets. The results show that when the improved Yolov5s-Pole model was used for detecting poles in orchards, its accuracy, recall, and mAP@50 were 0.803, 0.831, and 0.838 respectively, which increased by 0.5%, 10%, and 9.2% compared to the original Yolov5s model. Additionally, the weights, parameters, and GFLOPs of the Yolov5s-Pole model were 7.86 MB, 3,974,310, and 9, respectively. Compared to the original Yolov5s model, these represent compression rates of 42.2%, 43.4%, and 43.3%, respectively. The detection time for a single image using this model was 4.2 ms, and good robustness under different lighting conditions (dark, normal, and bright) was demonstrated. The model is suitable for deployment on agricultural UAVs\u2019 onboard equipment, and is of great practical significance for ensuring the efficiency and flight safety of agricultural UAVs.",

      "abstract": "Monitoring the population size of threatened primate species with minimal disturbance is becoming an outstanding requirement for conservation and wildlife management. Drones with thermal infrared (TIR) and visible spectrum (RGB) imaging are increasingly used to survey arboreal primates, but ground-truthing is still required to assess the effectiveness of drone-based count estimates. Our pilot study aims to assess the ability of a drone with both TIR and RGB sensors to detect, count, and identify semi-wild population of four endangered species of langurs and gibbon in the Endangered Primate Rescue Center (EPRC) in northern Vietnam. We found that TIR imagery enabled higher detection rates compared to RGB imagery and obtained an accurate count with the TIR only after four drone flights. We could identify langurs species based on thermal signature at a flight height of 50&nbsp;m from the ground level (max tree height\u2009=\u200915&nbsp;m), via size and shape of the body. With TIR imagery, we were able to record inconspicuous behaviors such as foraging and play. While some individuals initially showed flight or avoidance behaviors when the drone was sighted, these behaviors decreased or were absent on following drone surveys. Our study suggests that monitoring and precisely counting langur and gibbon species populations could be successful with the use of thermal drones only.",

      "abstract": "The increasing trend of autonomous driving vehicles in smart cities emphasizes the need for safe travel. However, the presence of obstacles, potholes, and complex road environments, such as poor illumination and occlusion, can cause blurred road images that may impact the accuracy of maneuver prediction in visual perception systems. To address these challenges, a novel ensemble model named ABHO-based deep CNN-BiLSTM has been proposed for traffic sign detection. This model combines a hybrid convolutional neural network (CNN) and bidirectional long short-term memory (BiLSTM) with the alarming-based hunting optimization (ABHO) algorithm to improve maneuver prediction accuracy. Additionally, a modified hough-enabled lane generative adversarial network (ABHO based HoughGAN) has been proposed, which is designed to be robust to blurred images. The ABHO algorithm, inspired by the defending and social characteristics of starling birds and Canis kojot, allows the model to efficiently search for the optimal solution from the available solutions in the search space. The proposed ensemble model has shown significantly improved accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity in maneuver prediction compared to previously utilized methods, with minimal error during lane detection. Overall, the proposed ensemble model addresses the challenges faced by autonomous driving vehicles in complex and obstructed road environments, offering a promising solution for enhancing safety and reliability in smart cities.",

      "abstract": "This paper proposes a novel hybrid car-following model: the physics-informed conditional generative adversarial network (PICGAN), designed to enhance multi-step car-following modeling in mixed traffic flow scenarios. This hybrid model leverages the strengths of both physics-based and deep-learning-based models. By taking advantage of the inherent structure of GAN, the PICGAN eliminates the need for an explicit weighting parameter typically used in the combination of traditional physics-based and data-driven models. The effectiveness of the proposed model is substantiated through case studies using the NGSIM I-80 dataset. These studies demonstrate the model\u2019s superior trajectory reproduction, suggesting its potential as a strong contender to replace conventional models in trajectory prediction tasks. Furthermore, the deployment of PICGAN significantly enhances the stability and efficiency in mixed traffic flow environments. Given its reliable and stable results, the PICGAN framework contributes substantially to the development of efficient longitudinal control strategies for connected autonomous vehicles (CAVs) in real-world mixed traffic conditions.",

      "abstract": "Vehicular ad hoc networks (VANETs) are used for vehicle to vehicle (V2V) and vehicle to infrastructure (V2I) communications. They are a special type of mobile ad hoc networks (MANETs) that can share useful information to improve road traffic and safety. In VANETs, vehicles are interconnected through a wireless medium, making the network susceptible to various attacks, such as Denial of Service (DoS), Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS), or even black hole attacks that exploit the wireless medium to disrupt the network. These attacks degrade the network performance of VANETs and prevent legitimate users from accessing resources. VANETs face unique challenges due to the fast mobility of vehicles and dynamic changes in network topology. The high-speed movement of vehicles results in frequent alterations in the network structure, posing difficulties in establishing and maintaining stable communication. Moreover, the dynamic nature of VANETs, with vehicles joining and leaving the network regularly, adds complexity to implementing effective security measures. These inherent constraints necessitate the development of robust and efficient solutions tailored to VANETs, ensuring secure and reliable communication in dynamic and rapidly evolving environments. Therefore, securing communication in VANETs is a crucial requirement. Traditional security countermeasures are not pertinent to autonomous vehicles. However, many machine learning (ML) technologies are being utilized to classify malicious packet information and a variety of solutions have been suggested to improve security in VANETs. In this paper, we propose an enhanced intrusion detection framework for VANETs that leverages mutual information to select the most relevant features for building an effective model and synthetic minority oversampling (SMOTE) to deal with the class imbalance problem. Random Forest (RF) is applied as our classifier, and the proposed method is compared with different ML techniques such as logistic regression (LR), K-Nearest Neighbor (KNN), decision tree (DT), and Support Vector Machine (SVM). The model is tested on three datasets, namely ToN-IoT, NSL-KDD, and CICIDS2017, addressing challenges such as missing values, unbalanced data, and categorical values. Our model demonstrated great performance in comparison to other models. It achieved high accuracy, precision, recall, and f1 score, with a 100% accuracy rate on the ToN-IoT dataset and 99.9% on both NSL-KDD and CICIDS2017 datasets. Furthermore, the ROC curve analysis demonstrated our model\u2019s exceptional performance, achieving a 100% AUC score.",

      "abstract": "The verticillium fungus has become a widespread threat to olive fields around the world in recent years. The accurate and early detection of the disease at scale could support solving the problem. In this paper, we use the YOLO version 5 model to detect verticillium fungus in olive trees using aerial RGB imagery captured by unmanned aerial vehicles. The aim of our paper is to compare different architectures of the model and evaluate their performance on this task. The architectures are evaluated at two different input sizes each through the most widely used metrics for object detection and classification tasks (precision, recall, mAP@0.5 and mAP@0.5:0.95). Our results show that the YOLOv5 algorithm is able to deliver good results in detecting olive trees and predicting their status, with the different architectures having different strengths and weaknesses.",

      "abstract": "Pathogenic pathogens invade the human body through various pathways, causing damage to host cells, tissues, and their functions, ultimately leading to the development of diseases and posing a threat to human health. The rapid and accurate detection of pathogenic pathogens in humans is crucial and pressing. Nucleic acid detection offers advantages such as higher sensitivity, accuracy, and specificity compared to antibody and antigen detection methods. However, conventional nucleic acid testing is time-consuming, labor-intensive, and requires sophisticated equipment and specialized medical personnel. Therefore, this review focuses on advanced nucleic acid testing systems that aim to address the issues of testing time, portability, degree of automation, and cross-contamination. These systems include extraction-free rapid nucleic acid testing, fully automated extraction, amplification, and detection, as well as fully enclosed testing and commercial nucleic acid testing equipment. Additionally, the biochemical methods used for extraction, amplification, and detection in nucleic acid testing are briefly described. We hope that this review will inspire further research and the development of more suitable extraction-free reagents and fully automated testing devices for rapid, point-of-care diagnostics.",

      "abstract": "Nowadays, deep reinforcement learning (DRL) has made remarkable achievements in unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) target following. However, current DRL-based solutions only exploit appearance features to recognize and follow the target, and thus suffer from loss of the target in complex occluded environments. To that end, a novel target following solution based on adaptive appearance-motion feature fusion is proposed. First, we follow prior works to exploit convolutional neural network to extract appearance features of the target from the observation image captured from a down-looking camera. Meanwhile, we innovatively leverage action sequences of UAV to explicitly encode the motion features of the target. An attention module is subsequently introduced to adaptively select relevant useful features which serve as environment states and are fed into the decision module to produce the motion action of UAV. The whole network is trained using Deep Q-Network to learn the motion policy from observation in an end-to-end manner. We perform simulation experiments on Virtual Robot Experimentation Platform. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that: (1) Our proposed method achieves higher tracking accuracy and longer tracking time in various environments compared to state-of-the-art approaches; (2) The learned DRL policy could be well generalized to unseen environments.",

      "abstract": "Accurate crop type and crop growth stage maps are essential for agricultural monitoring and ensuring food security. A wide variety of airborne and spaceborne sensors now provide high spatial, spectral, and temporal resolution images, which are vital for crop mapping and monitoring. Crop type and its growth stage can be characterized by spectral, spatial, and temporal features. The classification of crop types and growth stages has been explored in previous studies as independent tasks. However, the growth stages of a crop are an important factor in identifying the crop and vice-versa. A multi-task learning (MTL) framework is proposed in this work to classify the crop type and its growth stages simultaneously. A hybrid convolutional neural network and temporal convolutional network (CNN-TCN) architecture is presented to process a multitude of features relevant to the tasks. To learn the spatio\u2013spectral features, we fed the hyperspectral input to 3D convolution blocks and multispectral input was given into 2D convolution blocks. We reformulate these multi-channel features into two dimensions and feed them into the temporal convolutional neural network. Subsequently, we use two fully connected branches for each task. MTL frameworks were developed for multispectral (Mx), hyperspectral (Hx), and the combination of Hx and Mx (Hx-Mx) images to model crop type and crop growth stage classification. Results reveal that the proposed model for Hx-Mx outperformed the best single-task model by 13% and 8% in crop growth stage and crop type classification, respectively. Compared to single-task models, the proposed model can exploit the high spectral information from Hx images and high spatial information from Mx images, making the proposed model more useful for unmanned-aerial-vehicle-based crop mapping.",

      "abstract": "This study investigates the use of generative adversarial network (GAN)-based data augmentation to enhance data discretization for smoother drone input. The goal is to improve unmanned aerial vehicles\u2019 (UAVs) performance and maneuverability by incorporating synthetic inertial measurement unit (IMU) data. The GAN model is employed to generate synthetic IMU data that closely resemble real-world IMU measurements. The methodology involves training the GAN model using a dataset of real IMU data and then using the trained model to generate synthetic IMU data. The generated synthetic data are then combined with the real data for data discretization. The resulting improved data discretization is evaluated using statistical metrics and a similarity evaluation. The improved data discretization demonstrates enhanced drone performance in terms of flight stability, control accuracy, and smoothness of movements when compared to standard data discretization methods. These results highlight the potential of GAN-based data augmentation for enhancing data discretization and improving drone performance. The proposition of improved data discretization offers a tangible benefit for the successful integration of Advanced Air Mobility (AAM) systems. Enhancing the accuracy and reliability of data acquisition and processing in UAS makes UAS operations safer and more reliable. This improvement is crucial for achieving the goal of automated and autonomous operations in diverse settlement environments, encompassing multiple mobility modes such as ground and air transportation.",

      "abstract": "Reinforcement learning (RL) is known for its efficiency and practicality in single-agent planning, but it faces numerous challenges when applied to multi-agent scenarios. In this paper, a Super Sampling Info-GAN (SSIG) algorithm based on Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) is proposed to address the problem of state instability in Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL). The SSIG model allows a pair of GAN networks to analyze the previous state of dynamic system and predict the future state of consecutive state pairs. A multi-agent system (MAS) can deduce the complete state of all collaborating agents through SSIG. The proposed model has the potential to be employed in multi-autonomous underwater vehicle (multi-AUV) planning scenarios by combining it with the Soft Actor\u2013Critic (SAC) algorithm. Hence, this paper presents State Super Sampling Soft Actor\u2013Critic (S4AC), which is a new algorithm that combines the advantages of SSIG and SAC and can be applied to Multi-AUV hunting tasks. The simulation results demonstrate that the proposed algorithm has strong learning ability and adaptability and has a considerable success rate in hunting the evading target in multiple testing scenarios.",

      "abstract": "Deep learning-based algorithms for single object tracking (SOT) have shown impressive performance but remain susceptible to adversarial patch attacks. However, existing adversarial patch generation methods primarily focus on generating patches within the search region, neglecting the incorporation of template information, which limits their effectiveness in carrying out successful attacks. There is also a lack of evaluation metrics to assess the patch\u2019s adversarial abilities. In this study, we propose a bilateral adversarial patch-generating network to address these limitations and advance the field of adversarial patch generation for SOT networks. Our network leverages a Focus structure that effectively integrates both template and search region information, generating separate adversarial patches for each branch. We also introduce the DeFocus structure to solve the size discrepancy between the template and search region of the tracking network. To effectively mislead the tracking network, we have designed adversarial object loss and adversarial regression loss functions tailored to the network\u2019s output. Moreover, we propose a comprehensive evaluation metric that measures the patch\u2019s adversarial ability by establishing a relationship between the relative patch size and attack performance. As UAV view data often constitute small objects requiring smaller patches, we evaluate our approach on the UAV123 and UAVDT datasets. Our evaluation encompasses not only the overall attack performance but also the effectiveness of our strategy and the transferability of the attacks. Experimental results demonstrate that our algorithm generates patches with higher attack efficiency compared to existing methods.",

      "abstract": "At a worldwide scale, artificial intelligence (AI) is now an intrinsic part of various sectors and a significant strategic element in the business agendas of several industries including health care, finance and retail. Machine learning, an statistical paradigm of AI, is one of the most preferred technologies to achieve AI. Machine learning-oriented approaches exploit massive sized, unstructured and complicated dataset instances to learn from previous experiences and find insightful patterns. A range of statistical, probabilistic and optimization approaches are used to achieve this task. Early detection of chronic diseases is critical in the realm of biomedical research and healthcare communities, where it is pivotal to primarily diagnose the particular disease at probabilistically early stage in order to lower the death rate. Pneumonia mainly affects a huge number of people, particularly children and adults, in the developing and undeveloped nations that are characterized as overcrowding, inadequate sanitation, malnutrition, lack of suitable medical services and other risk factors. It is critical to detect pneumonia at its early stage in order to properly treat the infection. This paper presents an approach, i.e. DPUD (Disease Prediction for Unstructured Data). The proposed framework consists of an statistically novel and fine-tuned algorithmic procedure to address certain pain points of categorization problem such as selection of an optimal set of model hyperparameters and attain an improved statistical performance metrics with multichannel shared activation function and cost function. In experimental evaluation, our approach capitulates state-of-the-art computational achievement on Chest X-Ray Images for the Pneumonia Classification dataset, while being considerably much faster at specifically test time. The methodology presented in this chapter has an empirical scope for societal improvement, modernization and progress.",

Previous studies of the potential distribution of P. spumarius reveal that climatic factors are the main drivers of its distribution on the Mediterranean Basin scale. Other local studies reveal that the landscape could also have a role in the distribution of both species of P. spumarius and N. campestris. Our work is aimed at understanding the role and importance of bioclimatic and landscape environmental factors in the distributions of the vector and potential vector species P. spumarius, N. campestris, N. lineatus and L. coleoptrata on a regional scale across the Autonomous Community of Murcia (SE Spain), a region with relevant environmental gradients of thermality and crop intensity. We used sweeping nets for sampling 100 points during eight months in 2020. Using bioclimatic landscape composition and topographical variables, we carried out habitat suitability models for each species using the maximum entropy algorithm (MaxEnt). Distribution results for P. spumarius, N. campestris and N. lineatus indicate a gradient in habitat suitability, with the optimum in the coldest and wettest areas in landscapes with a high proportion of forest. All three species are absent from the southern third of the study region, the hottest, driest and most intensively cultivated area. These results are useful and should be considered in contingency plans against possible invasions of X. fastidiosa in Mediterranean regions.",

      "abstract": "The food production system is vulnerable to diseases more than ever, and the threat is increasing in an era of climate change that creates more favorable conditions for emerging diseases. Fortunately, scientists and engineers are making great strides to introduce farming innovations to tackle the challenge. Unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) remote sensing is among the innovations and thus is widely applied for crop health monitoring and phenotyping. This study demonstrated the versatility of aerial remote sensing in diagnosing yellow rust infection in spring wheats in a timely manner and determining an intervenable period to prevent yield loss. A small UAV equipped with an aerial multispectral sensor periodically flew over, and collected remotely sensed images of, an experimental field in Chacabuco (\u221234.64; \u221260.46), Argentina during the 2021 growing season. Post-collection images at the plot level were engaged in a thorough feature-engineering process by handcrafting disease-centric vegetation indices (VIs) from the spectral dimension, and grey-level co-occurrence matrix (GLCM) texture features from the spatial dimension. A machine learning pipeline entailing a support vector machine (SVM), random forest (RF), and multilayer perceptron (MLP) was constructed to identify locations of healthy, mild infection, and severe infection plots in the field. A custom 3-dimensional convolutional neural network (3D-CNN) relying on the feature learning mechanism was an alternative prediction method. The study found red-edge (690\u2013740 nm) and near infrared (NIR) (740\u20131000 nm) as vital spectral bands for distinguishing healthy and severely infected wheats. The carotenoid reflectance index 2 (CRI2), soil-adjusted vegetation index 2 (SAVI2), and GLCM contrast texture at an optimal distance d = 5 and angular direction \u03b8 = 135\u00b0 were the most correlated features. The 3D-CNN-based wheat disease monitoring performed at 60% detection accuracy as early as 40 days after sowing (DAS), when crops were tillering, increasing to 71% and 77% at the later booting and flowering stages (100\u2013120 DAS), and reaching a peak accuracy of 79% for the spectral-spatio-temporal fused data model. The success of early disease diagnosis from low-cost multispectral UAVs not only shed new light on crop breeding and pathology but also aided crop growers by informing them of a prevention period that could potentially preserve 3\u20137% of the yield at the confidence level of 95%.",

      "abstract": "With the maturity of Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) technology and the development of Industrial Internet of Things, drones have become an indispensable part of intelligent transportation systems. Due to the absence of an effective identification scheme, most commercial drones suffer from impersonation attacks during their flight procedure. Some pioneering works have already attempted to validate the pilot\u2019s legal status at the beginning and during the flight time. However, the off-the-shelf pilot identification scheme can not adapt to the dynamic pilot membership management due to a lack of extensibility. To address this challenge, we propose an incremental learning-based drone pilot identification scheme to protect drones from impersonation attacks. By utilizing the pilot temporal operational behavioral traits, the proposed identification scheme could validate pilot legal status and dynamically adapt newly registered pilots into a well-constructed identification scheme for dynamic pilot membership management. After systemic experiments, the proposed scheme was capable of achieving the best average identification accuracy with 95.71% on P450 and 94.23% on S500. With the number of registered pilots being increased, the proposed scheme still maintains high identification performance for the newly added and the previously registered pilots. Owing to the minimal system overhead, this identification scheme demonstrates high potential to protect drones from impersonation attacks.",

      "abstract": "Pyroelectric infrared sensors (PIR) are widely used as infrared (IR) detectors due to their basic implementation, low cost, low power, and performance. Combined with a Fresnel lens, they can be used as a binary detector in applications of presence and motion control. Furthermore, due to their features, they can be used in autonomous intelligent devices or included in robotics applications or sensor networks. In this work, two neural processing architectures are presented: (1) an analog processing approach to achieve the behavior of a presynaptic neuron from a PIR sensor. An analog circuit similar to the leaky integrate and fire model is implemented to be able to generate spiking rates proportional to the IR stimuli received at a PIR sensor. (2) An embedded postsynaptic neuron where a spiking neural network matrix together with an algorithm based on digital processing techniques is introduced. This structure allows connecting a set of sensors to the post-synaptic circuit emulating an optic nerve. As a case study, the entire neural processing approach presented in this paper is applied to optical flow detection considering a four-PIR array as input. The results validate both the spiking approach for an analog sensor presented and the ability to retrieve the analog information sent as spike trains in a simulated optic nerve.",

However, many of these techniques may prove to be time-consuming. With the advancement of computer vision techniques, automated bird detection and recognition have become possible. In this manuscript, we present an application of an object-detection model for identifying and tracking wild bird species in natural environments. We used a dataset of bird images captured in the wild and trained the YOLOv4 model to detect bird species with high accuracy. We evaluated the model\u2019s performance on a separate set of test images and achieved an average precision of 91.28%. Our method surpassed the time-consuming nature of manual identification and tracking, allowing for efficient and precise monitoring of bird populations. Through extensive evaluation on a separate set of test images, we demonstrated the performance of our model. Furthermore, our results demonstrated the potential of using YOLOv4 for automated bird detection and monitoring in the wild, which could help conservationists better understand bird populations and identify potential threats.",

      "abstract": "This paper proposes a method of reducing oscillations for integrations of the artificial potential field algorithm in real-time robot manipulator path planning using proximity sensors. Proximity sensing is a technology that has the potential to play an essential role in the development of robotics. It can fulfill the promise of safe, robust, and autonomous systems in industry and everyday life alongside humans by enabling the ability of online and fast-reacting motions without the need for visual mapping. In this context, the artificial potential field technique is one of the most suitable methods for path planning due to its simplicity of application and efficiency in real-time systems without the need for global mapping. Despite its efficiency, this technique is known to be susceptible to problems such as local minima and oscillations within the overall path. To solve this problem, a method of reducing the oscillations is proposed by modifying the direction of the repulsive force to follow its orthogonal projection onto the attractive force. Since with conventional repulsive motions, the robot only moves in one direction, opposite to the obstacles, this approach has better exploitation of the redundancy space to maintain the task motion and is less likely to get stuck in local minima. The effectiveness of this proposed method is demonstrated through simulations on real robot manipulators in comparison with the original artificial potential field technique.",

Among the environmentally significant issues, wildfires pose a serious threat to the global ecosystem. The damages inflicted upon forests are manifold, leading not only to the destruction of terrestrial ecosystems but also to climate changes. Consequently, reducing their impact on both people and nature requires the adoption of effective approaches for prevention, early warning, and well-coordinated interventions. This document presents an analysis of the evolution of various technologies used in the detection, monitoring, and prevention of forest fires from past years to the present. It highlights the strengths, limitations, and future developments in this field. Forest fires have emerged as a critical environmental concern due to their devastating effects on ecosystems and the potential repercussions on the climate. Understanding the evolution of technology in addressing this issue is essential to formulate more effective strategies for mitigating and preventing wildfires.",

      "abstract": "Forest fires are one of the most serious natural disasters that threaten forest resources. The early and accurate identification of forest fires is crucial for reducing losses. Compared with satellites and sensors, unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) are widely used in forest fire monitoring tasks due to their flexibility and wide coverage. The key to fire monitoring is to accurately segment the area where the fire is located in the image. However, for early forest fire monitoring, fires captured remotely by UAVs have the characteristics of a small area, irregular contour, and susceptibility to forest cover, making the accurate segmentation of fire areas from images a challenge. This article proposes an FBC-ANet network architecture that integrates boundary enhancement modules and context-aware modules into a lightweight encoder\u2013decoder network. FBC-Anet can extract deep semantic features from images and enhance shallow edge features, thereby achieving an effective segmentation of forest fire areas in the image. The FBC-ANet model uses an Xception network as the backbone of an encoder to extract features of different scales from images. By transforming the extracted deep semantic features through the CIA module, the model\u2019s feature learning ability for fire pixels is enhanced, making feature extraction more robust. FBC-ANet integrates the decoder into the BEM module to enhance the extraction of shallow edge features in images. The experimental results indicate that the FBC-ANet model has a better segmentation performance for small target forest fires compared to the baseline model. The segmentation accuracy on the dataset FLAME is 92.19%, the F1 score is 90.76%, and the IoU reaches 83.08%. This indicates that the FBC-ANet model can indeed extract more valuable features related to fire in the image, thereby better segmenting the fire area from the image.",

      "abstract": "The dynamic contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging (DCE-MRI) technique has taken on a significant and increasing role in diagnostic procedures and treatments for patients who suffer from chronic kidney disease. Careful segmentation of kidneys from DCE-MRI scans is an essential early step towards the evaluation of kidney function. Recently, deep convolutional neural networks have increased in popularity in medical image segmentation. To this end, in this paper, we propose a new and fully automated two-phase approach that integrates convolutional neural networks and level set methods to delimit kidneys in DCE-MRI scans. We first develop two convolutional neural networks that rely on the U-Net structure (UNT) to predict a kidney probability map for DCE-MRI scans. Then, to leverage the segmentation performance, the pixel-wise kidney probability map predicted from the deep model is exploited with the shape prior information in a level set method to guide the contour evolution towards the target kidney. Real DCE-MRI datasets of 45 subjects are used for training, validating, and testing the proposed approach. The valuation results demonstrate the high performance of the two-phase approach, achieving a Dice similarity coefficient of 0.95 \u00b1 0.02 and intersection over union of 0.91 \u00b1 0.03, and 1.54 \u00b1 1.6 considering a 95% Hausdorff distance. Our intensive experiments confirm the potential and effectiveness of that approach over both UNT models and numerous recent level set-based methods.",

      "abstract": "Lidar, a technology at the heart of autonomous driving and robotic mobility, performs 3D imaging of a complex scene by measuring the time of flight of returning light pulses. Many technological challenges, including enhancement of the observation field of view (FoV), acceleration of the imaging frame rate, improvement of the ambiguity range, reduction of fabrication cost, and component size, must be simultaneously addressed so that lidar technology reaches the performance needed to strongly impact the global market. We propose an innovative solution to address the problem of wide FoV and extended unambiguous range using an acousto-optic modulator that rapidly scans a large-area metasurface deflector. We further exploit a multiplexing illumination technique traditionally deployed in the context of telecommunication theory to extend the ambiguity range and to drastically improve the signal-to-noise ratio of the measured signal. Compacting our metasurface-scanning lidar system to chip-scale dimension would open new and exciting perspectives, eventually relevant to the autonomous vehicles and robotic industries.",

      "abstract": "This paper presents a general approach to compute energy optimal flight paths for unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) in urban environments. To minimize the energy required, the flight path is optimized by exploiting local wind phenomena, i.e., upwind and tailwind areas from the airflow around buildings. A realistic wind field of a model urban environment typical for continental Europe is generated using PALM, a Large Eddy Simulation tool. The calculated wind field feeds into the flight path planning algorithm to minimize the energy required. A specifically tailored A-Star-Algorithm is used to optimize flight trajectories. The approach is demonstrated on a delivery UAV benchmark scenario. Energy optimal flight paths are compared to shortest way trajectories for 12 different scenarios. It is shown that energy can be saved significantly while flying in a city using knowledge of the current wind field.",

      "abstract": "This article tests the hypothesis that \u201cthe likelihood that the species will react and level at which they do to the unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) is related to the altitude, number of passes, sound intensity, type of UAV, takeoff distance, and species.\u201d This paper examined the behavioral responses of a group of free ranging ungulate species (Oryx, Kudu, Springbok, Giraffe, Eland, Hartebeest, and Impala) found in an animal reserve in Namibia to the presence of different in-flight UAV models. The study included 397 passes (trials) over 99 flights at altitudes ranging from 15 to 55 meters in three categories of response level: No response, Alert, and Movement. The ungulates were unhabituated to the UAVs and the study was conducted in the presence of stress-inducing events that occur naturally in the environment. Certain species were found to be more reactive than others, in addition to several displaying different response levels in single or mixed herd environments. Zebras were found to be less responsive in mixed herd environments while Oryx were present, as compared to when the Oryx were not; suggesting that some species may respond based on other species perception of threat or their relative fitness levels. The UAVs also produced inconsistent response rates between movement and alert behavior. The reference vehicle, Phantom 3 was much more likely than the Mavic to induce an alert response, while both having similar probabilities of inducing a movement response. Furthermore, the Custom X8 showed significantly more alert and movement responses than the other UAVs. This shows there may be several aspects to the UAVs that affect the responses of the ungulates. For instance, the sound intensity may alert the species more often, but close proximity may induce a movement response. More generally, the data shows that when the UAV is flying above 50 meters and has a measured sound intensity below 50 dB, the likelihood of inducing a movement response on an ungulate species is below 6% regardless of the vehicle on the first pass over the animals. Additionally, with each subsequent pass the likelihood of response dropped by approximately 20 percent. The results suggest a stronger correlation between flight altitude and response across the different ungulates, and the evidence suggests rapid habituation to the UAVs.",

      "abstract": "Accurate localization is a critical task in underwater navigation. Typical localization methods use a set of acoustic sensors and beacons to estimate relative position, whose geometric configuration has a significant impact on the localization accuracy. Although there is much effort in the literature to define optimal 2D or 3D sensor placement, the optimal sensor placement in irregular and constrained 3D surfaces, such as autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs) or other structures, is not exploited for improving localization. Additionally, most applications using AUVs employ commercial acoustic modems or compact arrays, therefore the optimization of the placement of spatially independent sensors is not a considered issue. This article tackles acoustic sensor placement optimization in irregular and constrained 3D surfaces, for inverted ultra-short baseline (USBL) approaches, to improve localization accuracy. The implemented multi-objective memetic algorithm combines an evaluation of the geometric sensor\u2019s configuration, using the Cramer-Rao Lower Bound (CRLB), with the incidence angle of the received signal. A case study is presented over a simulated homing and docking scenario to demonstrate the proposed optimization algorithm.",

      "abstract": "Nowadays, multirotors are versatile systems that can be employed in several scenarios, where their increasing autonomy allows them to achieve complex missions without human intervention. This paper presents a framework for autonomous missions with low-cost Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) in Global Navigation Satellite System-denied (GNSS-denied) environments. This paper presents hardware choices and software modules for localization, perception, global planning, local re-planning for obstacle avoidance, and a state machine to dictate the overall mission sequence. The entire software stack has been designed exploiting the Robot Operating System (ROS) middleware and has been extensively validated in both simulation and real environment tests. The proposed solution can run both in simulation and in real-world scenarios without modification thanks to a small sim-to-real gap with PX4 software-in-the-loop functionality. The overall system has competed successfully in the Leonardo Drone Contest, an annual competition between Italian Universities with a focus on low-level, resilient, and fully autonomous tasks for vision-based UAVs, proving the robustness of the entire system design.",

The use of different sensors, ranging from active to passive, and also structured light scanners or hybrid solutions, the various destinations and purposes of the final results combined with the extreme variety of possible objects have made it a field of investigation highly inquired in the literature.</p><p>The present study aims to analyse and discuss a digitalisation workflow applied to four Sumerian civilisation masterpieces preserved in the British Museum. The dense and accurate 3D point clouds derived from a specimen of Articulated Arm Coordinate Measuring Machines in collaboration with Faro technologies have twofold roles: ground truth and geometric reference of the final digital replicas. Digital photogrammetry is employed to enrich the models with the relevant radiometric component. The significant contribution results, exploiting co-registration strategies, offer careful guidance of a photogrammetric protocol created in a highly controlled environment combined with skilful expedients and devices. The proposed approach enables the acquisition of high-quality and radiometrically balanced images and improves the possibility of automating the masking procedure before the photogrammetric processing.</p>",

      "abstract": "<p><strong class=\"journal-contentHeaderColor\">Abstract.</strong> Today, there is an increasing use of airborne sensors in archaeology, especially to investigate the surface of more or less vast territories quickly and accurately. In particular, airborne laser scanning technologies from small remotely piloted aircraft are rapidly developing towards increasingly high-performance solutions for the investigation of archaeological evidence hidden by vegetation or more or less substantial soil deposits. The proposed contribution intends to insert itself within this field of archaeological research by presenting \"UAVIMALS\" (Unmanned Aerial Vehicle Integrated with Micro Airborne Laser Scanner), an aerial remote sensing system of \"soil marks\", designed for surface archaeological investigations and the result of an Early Career Grant from the National Geographic Society. The system, consisting of a customised drone based on an open architecture and software for vehicle control and data processing, integrates a solid-state laser sensor, commonly engineered for obstacle avoidance, but here exploited to process accurate DTM (Digital Terrain Model) of small land surfaces with a significant reduction in cost and acquisition time. The system, whose engineering was contributed by the BioRobotics Institute of the S. Anna University of Pisa, was tested within the archaeological context of Leopoli - Cencelle (Tarquinia, Italy). A mediaeval city that has been researched for about 25 years by the Chair of Christian and Medieval Archaeology at the 'Sapienza' University of Rome. Experimentation missions carried out on the site, which is still only partially investigated, have been successful in bringing to light some urban areas that had not yet been investigated.</p>",

      "abstract": "La vocalizaci\u00f3n en las aves cumple un papel importante en el establecimiento del territorio, en la atracci\u00f3n de la pareja, en el mantenimiento de interacciones conespec\u00edficas y en la emisi\u00f3n de se\u00f1ales relacionadas con comida o amenaza. En Malasia, la mayor\u00eda de los estudios de comportamiento de rapaces sobre vocalizaci\u00f3n se han llevado a cabo en rapaces nocturnas. Dichos estudios a menudo se han visto limitados por la dificultad de acceder a los h\u00e1bitats donde residen las especies de bosque y por los comportamientos esquivos de las aves rapaces. Evaluamos la vocalizaci\u00f3n y los patrones de actividad vocal de una rapaz diurna com\u00fan, Nisaetus cirrhatus, en una reserva forestal aislada de tierras bajas, la Reserva Forestal Ayer Hitam en Selangor, Malasia, a mediados de abril de 2021. Se colocaron grabadores bioac\u00fasticos automatizados durante cinco d\u00edas en cuatro sitios diferentes para recolectar pasivamente las vocalizaciones de N. cirrhatus. Registramos 480 horas de llamadas durante los cinco d\u00edas y N. cirrhatus emiti\u00f3 al menos siete tipos de llamadas, con un pico de llamadas y llamadas m\u00e1s largas al mediod\u00eda (1100 H y 1200 H, respectivamente). Las llamadas se escucharon desde 30 minutos antes del amanecer (0600 H) hasta poco despu\u00e9s del atardecer (1900 H). El tipo 1 de llamada fue por mucho el m\u00e1s com\u00fan (2738 llamadas durante cinco d\u00edas) y se emiti\u00f3 durante todo el d\u00eda, posiblemente durante el vuelo y cuando estaba posado. Otros tipos de llamadas se emitieron desde \u00faltima hora de la ma\u00f1ana (1000 H), con excepci\u00f3n del tipo 3 de llamada, que se emiti\u00f3 antes (0900 H). Nuestros hallazgos pueden ayudar a proporcionar mejores m\u00e9todos de estudio de aves rapaces, as\u00ed como llenar el vac\u00edo de conocimiento sobre las vocalizaciones diurnas de aves rapaces en Malasia.

      "abstract": "Autonomous transportation systems have an immense impact on the way of our day-to-day commute or traveling. Connectedness is an inseparable part of these systems, and it is possible through Intelligent Transportation Systems applications. These applications use a network system known as Vehicular Ad hoc Network (VANET). However, the safety that is provided by VANETs can be easily compromised by malicious users. Hence there is a need for an Intrusion Detection System (IDS). We designed an IDS model that can collect network data cooperatively from vehicles and Roadside Units (RSUs). For training the core of our proposed IDS we generated synthetic network data with the help of the widely used Network Simulator 3 (ns-3) and Simulation of Urban Mobility (SUMO) simulation tools. We also generated separate test data that is not just a split part of the training data. This ensures the elimination of the misleading performance result of an overfitted model. We employed a multi-class IDS using Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) with a novel feature extraction method known as Context-Aware Feature Extraction-Based CNN (CAFECNN). The CAFECNN model takes advantage of the collected network flow data to detect both passive and active types of attacks. The results show that the proposed model is stronger in identification of hard-to-detect passive attacks compared to traditional machine learning methods. We also evaluated the model using real-time simulations and observed an immediate improvement in the performance of the network despite the intruders, especially in terms of packet delivery ratio and network throughput. \u00c2\u00a9 2023 Elsevier Inc.",

      "abstract": "Objective: Routine haematoxylin and eosin (H&E) photomicrographs from human papillomavirus-associated oropharyngeal squamous cell carcinomas (HPV + OpSCC) contain a wealth of prognostic information. In this study, we developed a high content image analysis (HCIA) workflow to quantify features of H&E images from HPV + OpSCC patients to identify prognostic features and predict patient outcomes. Methods: First, we have developed an open-source HCIA tool for single-cell segmentation and classification of H&E images. Subsequently, we have used our HCIA tool to analyse a set of 889 images from diagnostic H&E slides in a retrospective cohort of HPV + OpSCC patients with favourable (FO, n = 60) or unfavourable (UO, n = 30) outcomes. We have identified and measured 31 prognostic features which were quantified in each sample and used to train a neural network (NN) model to predict patient outcomes. Results: Univariate and multivariate statistical analyses revealed significant differences between FO and UO patients in 31 and 17 variables, respectively (P < 0.05). At the single-image level, the NN model had an overall accuracy of 72.5% and 71.2% in recognising FO and UO patients when applied to test or validation sets, respectively. When considering 10 images per patient, the accuracy of the NN model increased to 86.7% in the test set. Conclusion: Our open-source H&E analysis workflow and predictive models confirm previously reported prognostic features and identifies novel factors which predict HPV + OpSCC outcomes with promising accuracy. Our work supports the use of machine learning in digital pathology to exploit clinically relevant features in routine diagnostic pathology without additional biomarkers. \u00c2\u00a9 2023 The Authors",

      "abstract": "High-resolution multispectral imaging of agricultural fields is expensive but helpful in detecting subtle variations in plant health and stress symptoms before the appearance of visible indications. To aid precision agriculture (PA) practices, an innovative and inexpensive protocol for robust and timely monitoring of vegetation symptoms has been evaluated. This innovative but inexpensive protocol uses machine vision (MV) and generative adversarial networks (GAN) to translate red-green-blue (RGB) imagery captured with unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) into a valuable normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) map. This study used direct translation of RGB imagery in NDVI index, in contrast with similar studies that used GANs in near-infrared (NIR) translation. The protocol was tested by flying a fixed-winged UAV developed by senseFly Inc. (Cheseaux-sur-Lausanne, Switzerland) model Ebee-X, equipped with a RedEdge-MX sensor, to capture images from five different potatoes fields located in Prince Edward Island \u2013 Canada, during the growing season of 2021. The images were captured throughout the growing season under vegetation (15\u201330 DAP; days after plantation), tuber formation (30\u201345 DAP), tuber bulking (75\u2013110 DAP), and tuber maturation stages (&gt;\u2009110 DAP). The NDVI was calculated from captured UAV aerial surveys using NIR and red bands to develop pairwise datasets for the training of GANs. Five hundred pairwise images were used (80% training, 10% validation, and 10% testing) for training and evaluation of GANs. Two famous GANs, namely Pix2Pix and Pix2PixHD, were tested compared to various training and evaluation indicators. The Pix2PixHD outperformed Pix2Pix GAN by recording lower root mean square error (RMSE) (5.40 to 13.73) and higher structural similarity index matrix (SSIM) score (0.69 to 0.90) during the evaluation of the protocol. The results of this study are breakthroughs to be used for economic vegetation and orchard health monitoring after the training of models. The trained GANs can translate simple RGB domains into useful vegetation indices maps for variable rate PA practices. This innovative protocol can also translate remote sensing imagery of large-scale agricultural fields and commercial orchards into NDVI to extract useful information about plant health indicators.",

      "abstract": "The dynamic development of microelectronics and wireless communication at the turn of the 20th and 21st centuries contributed to the increase in the availability and popularity of all kinds of unmanned platforms, air, land, surface, and underwater. In the case of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), also popularly known as drones, the significant (crucial) advantages are high freedom of motion (i.e., the ability to move in three planes) and the possibility of using it practically anywhere (as opposed to water platforms). These factors influenced the dynamic development of this market sector and the high availability of various models and equipment. UAVs are being used in many sectors and services, both for civil and military purposes. Widespread availability, low cost, and ease of use also favor the possibility of using civilian UAVs for criminal, smuggling, terrorist, or military purposes. Recent armed conflicts, e.g., in Nagorno-Karabakh or Ukraine, and the situation on the eastern Polish-Belarusian border clearly show this. All countries recognize the potential and threat posed by the development of unmanned platforms. Therefore, for several years, special attention has been paid to analyses and research in sensors, effectors, and anti-drone systems. It is worth emphasizing that some effectors (e.g., jammers or spoofers) may significantly affect the navigation process of neighboring objects that use global navigation satellite systems (GNSSs). On the other hand, the use of anti-drone systems is important, especially in the context of protecting institutions and facilities of companies, state administration (i.a., embassies, consulates), army, strategic importance objects (e.g., related to energy, chemical industry), or protection of mass events. In this paper, we present an overview of solutions available on the market and development directions in the field of anti-drone technology.",

      "abstract": "Diabetic retinopathy (DR), a leading cause of preventable blindness, is expected to remain a growing health burden worldwide. Screening to detect early sight-threatening lesions of DR can reduce the burden of vision loss; nevertheless, the process requires intensive manual labor and extensive resources to accommodate the increasing number of patients with diabetes. Artificial intelligence (AI) has been shown to be an effective tool which can potentially lower the burden of screening DR and vision loss. In this article, we review the use of AI for DR screening on color retinal photographs in different phases of application, ranging from development to deployment. Early studies of machine learning (ML)-based algorithms using feature extraction to detect DR achieved a high sensitivity but relatively lower specificity. Robust sensitivity and specificity were achieved with the application of deep learning (DL), although ML is still used in some tasks. Public datasets were utilized in retrospective validations of the developmental phases in most algorithms, which require a large number of photographs. Large prospective clinical validation studies led to the approval of DL for autonomous screening of DR although the semi-autonomous approach may be preferable in some real-world settings. There have been few reports on real-world implementations of DL for DR screening. It is possible that AI may improve some real-world indicators for eye care in DR, such as increased screening uptake and referral adherence, but this has not been proven. The challenges in deployment may include workflow issues, such as mydriasis to lower ungradable cases; technical issues, such as integration into electronic health record systems and integration into existing camera systems; ethical issues, such as data privacy and security; acceptance of personnel and patients; and health-economic issues, such as the need to conduct health economic evaluations of using AI in the context of the country. The deployment of AI for DR screening should follow the governance model for AI in healthcare which outlines four main components: fairness, transparency, trustworthiness, and accountability.",

      "abstract": "Autonomous Driving (AD) datasets, when used in combination with deep learning techniques, have enabled significant progress on difficult AD tasks such as perception, trajectory prediction, and motion planning. These datasets represent the content of driving scenes as captured by various sensors, including cameras, RADAR, and LiDAR, along with 2D/3D annotations of traffic participants. Such datasets, however, often fail to capture and to represent the spatial, temporal, and semantic relations between entities in a scene. This lack of knowledge leads to a shallow understanding of the true complexity and dynamics inherent in a driving scene. In this paper, we argue that a Knowledge Graph (KG)-based representation of driving scenes, that provides a richer structure and semantics, will lead to further improvements in AD. Towards this goal, we developed a layered architecture and ontologies for specific AD datasets and a fundamental ontology of shared concepts. We also built KGs for three different AD datasets. We perform an analysis with respect to information contained in the AD KGs and outline how the additional semantic information contained in the KGs could improve the performance of different AD tasks. Moreover, example queries are provided to retrieve relevant information that can be exploited for augmenting the AD pipelines. All artifacts needed for reproducibility purposes are provided via a GitHub repository. (https://github.com/boschresearch/dskg-constructor - Note that we removed our internal namespaces of reused ontologies, because of confidentiality and to provide self-contained ontologies. As the original datasets are under specific licences, the KGs are not published, but we provide the scripts to generate them.). \u00c2\u00a9 2023 World Scientific Publishing Company.",

      "abstract": "Pedestrians and drivers are expected to safely navigate complex urban environments along with several non cooperating agents. Autonomous vehicles will soon replicate this capability. Each agent acquires a representation of the world from an egocentric perspective and must make decisions ensuring safety for itself and others. This requires to predict motion patterns of observed agents for a far enough future. In this paper we propose MANTRA, a model that exploits memory augmented networks to effectively predict multiple trajectories of other agents, observed from an egocentric perspective. Our model stores observations in memory and uses trained controllers to write meaningful pattern encodings and read trajectories that are most likely to occur in future. We show that our method is able to natively perform multi-modal trajectory prediction obtaining state-of-the art results on four datasets. Moreover, thanks to the non-parametric nature of the memory module, we show how once trained our system can continuously improve by ingesting novel patterns. \u00c2\u00a9 1979-2012 IEEE.",

      "abstract": "The third-generation partnership project (3GPP) defined several scenarios of vehicle-to-everything (V2X) networks such as vehicle-to-vehicle, vehicle-to-pedestrian, and vehicle-to-infrastructure. Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) exploiting such scenarios for vehicular applications like vehicular-platooning, autonomous driving, and traffic management have shown improved networks\u00e2\u0080\u0099 performance in UAV-V2X (U-V2X) communications. This promising performance is typically obtained by considering high directional UAV antennas. However, the UAV vibration makes UAV antennas\u00e2\u0080\u0099 beam-width sensitive to UAV fluctuations which results in degrading the networks\u00e2\u0080\u0099 performance. Thus, in this paper, the performance of a U-V2X network in the presence of UAV fluctuations is investigated. The UAVs are modeled using an independent homogeneous Poisson Point Process and the vehicular-nodes are modeled using an independent Poisson Line Process. To this end, the association probability and success probability of various links such as vehicular-node connected to a UAV link, vehicular-node connected to a near-by vehicular-node link, and the overall U-V2X link are derived. In addition, the effect of different network settings such as the number of vehicular-nodes, UAVs, roads, and antennas is quantified. Moreover, the spectral efficiency of a U-V2X network is evaluated. Extensive simulations revealed that V2X networks facilitate UAVs and that for less dense areas with fewer roads, buildings, and crowds; UAVs provide more reliable links for connectivity than vehicular-nodes. Furthermore, it is also revealed that UAVs provide less reliable connection for V2X networks with larger UAV antenna fluctuations. \u00c2\u00a9 2023 Elsevier B.V.",

Besides, we jointly explore the advantages of Medium Access Control (MAC) protocols in the link layer and routing schemes in the network layer to facilitate the multi-hop data transmission for the ground vehicles. Particularly, the network control plane in the UAV can manage the whole network effectively via fully exploiting the acquired network topology information and traffic requests from each vehicle, and implements various kinds of control based on different traffic demands, which can enhance the networking flexibility and scalability significantly in vehicular networks.

      "abstract": "Signal temporal logic (STL) has been found to be an expressive language for describing complex, time-constrained tasks in several robotic applications. Existing methods encode such specifications by either using integer constraints or by employing set invariance techniques. While in the first case this results in a mixed integer linear program (MILP), control problems, in the latter case, designer-specific choices may induce conservatism in the robot's performance and the satisfaction of the task. In this article, a continuous-time receding horizon control scheme (RHS) is proposed that exploits the tradeoff between task satisfaction and performance costs such as actuation and state costs, traditionally considered in RHS schemes. The satisfaction of the STL tasks is encoded using time-varying control barrier functions that are designed online, thus avoiding the integer expressions that are often used in literature. The recursive feasibility of the proposed scheme is guaranteed by the satisfaction of a time-varying terminal constraint that ensures the satisfaction of the task with predetermined robustness. The effectiveness of the method is illustrated in a multirobot simulation scenario. \u00c2\u00a9 1963-2012 IEEE.",

In this paper, we aimed to counter simultaneous jamming and eavesdropping attacks by jointly designing an active beamforming vector at the base station (BS) and reflect phase shifts at the RIS. Specifically, considering imperfect angular channel state information (CSI), the sum secrecy rate maximization problem in the worst case could be formulated, which is NP-hard and non-convex. To address this problem, we improved the robust enhanced signal-to-leakage-and-noise ratio (E-SLNR) beamforming to reduce the computational complexity and mitigate the impact of interference, eavesdropping and jamming. Furthermore, a genetic algorithm with a tabu search (GA-TS) method was proposed to efficiently obtain an approximate optimal solution. The simulation results demonstrated that the proposed GA-TS method converged faster with better results than conventional GA, while the proposed robust scheme could achieve higher sum secrecy rates than the zero-forcing (ZF) and SLNR schemes.",

Specifically, unmanned aerial systems (UAS) and UAS traffic management promise to improve firefighters' situational awareness, coordination, communications, safety, and strategy. While these technologies could be beneficial, there has been little formal investigation into how much benefit would occur and whether these benefits would outweigh hazards introduced by these systems. To better understand the impacts of these technologies, this article presents a high-level dynamic simulation for evaluating wildfire response performance and resilience incorporating fire propagation, surveillance and communication, response planning, and the resulting mitigation actions. This simulation is then used to study the impact of communications and surveillance improvement, considering 1) the effect on fire containment and ground crew injuries and 2) the effect of introduced and existing disruptive fault scenarios. Simulating this model over a large number of scenarios finds that these changes can improve containment and reduce ground crew injuries. While these improvements generalize over both existing and introduced single-fault scenarios and, thus, result in a more resilient system, they could be negated if the introduced communications infrastructure is prone to full-scale outages. \u00c2\u00a9 2007-2012 IEEE.",

      "abstract": "Plastic waste is a growing environmental concern that poses a significant threat to onshore ecosystems, human health, and wildlife. The accumulation of plastic waste in oceans has reached a staggering estimate of over eight million tons annually, leading to hazardous outcomes in marine life and the food chain. Plastic waste is prevalent in urban areas, posing risks to animals that may ingest it or become entangled in it, and negatively impacting the economy and tourism industry. Effective plastic waste management requires a comprehensive approach that includes reducing consumption, promoting recycling, and developing innovative technologies such as automated plastic detection systems. The development of accurate and efficient plastic detection methods is therefore essential for effective waste management. To address this challenge, machine learning techniques such as the YOLOv5 model have emerged as promising tools for developing automated plastic detection systems. Furthermore, there is a need to study both visible light (RGB) and near-infrared (RGNIR) as part of plastic waste detection due to the unique properties of plastic waste in different environmental settings. To this end, two plastic waste datasets, comprising RGB and RGNIR images, were utilized to train the proposed model, YOLOv5m. The performance of the model was then evaluated using a 10-fold cross-validation method on both datasets. The experiment was extended by adding background images into the training dataset to reduce false positives. An additional experiment was carried out to fuse both the RGB and RGNIR datasets. A performance-metric score called the Weighted Metric Score (WMS) was proposed, where the WMS equaled the sum of the mean average precision at the intersection over union (IoU) threshold of 0.5 (mAP@0.5) \u00d7 0.1 and the mean average precision averaged over different IoU thresholds ranging from 0.5 to 0.95 (mAP@0.5:0.95) \u00d7 0.9. In addition, a 10-fold cross-validation procedure was implemented. Based on the results, the proposed model achieved the best performance using the fusion of the RGB and RGNIR datasets when evaluated on the testing dataset with a mean of mAP@0.5, mAP@0.5:0.95, and a WMS of 92.96% \u00b1 2.63%, 69.47% \u00b1 3.11%, and 71.82% \u00b1 3.04%, respectively. These findings indicate that utilizing both normal visible light and the near-infrared spectrum as feature representations in machine learning could lead to improved performance in plastic waste detection. This opens new opportunities in the development of automated plastic detection systems for use in fields such as automation, environmental management, and resource management.",

      "abstract": "Microscopic traffic flow data, an important input to virtual test scenarios for autonomous driving, are often difficult to obtain in large quantities to allow for batch testing. In this paper, a neural network for generating microscopic traffic flow scene fragments is proposed, which is improved by adding Gate Recurrent Units (GRU) to the discriminator of the Deep Convolutional Generative Adversarial Network (DCGAN) to enable it to better discriminate continuous data. Subsequently, this paper compares individual sample motion trajectories of the generated data using Grey Relational Analysis (GRA) and Dynamic Time Warping algorithm (DTW) at the microscopic scale, and evaluates the overall scenes generated using averaged statistics at the macroscopic scale. The results show that the method proposed in this paper can generate realistic microscopic traffic flow data very well and that the neural network proposed in this paper can generate better near-realistic microscopic traffic flow data than the original DCGAN under the evaluation metrics used in this paper.",

The BAM algorithm partitions the search domain dynamically, builds surrogate models around carefully selected evaluated points, and uses these models to exploit local function trends and speed up convergence. For model construction, BAM employs Automated Learning of Algebraic Models (ALAMO). The ALAMO algorithm generates algebraic models of the black-box function using various base functions and selection criteria. BAM\u2019s potentially optimal identification scheme saves computational effort and prevents delays in searching for optimal solutions. The BAM algorithm is guaranteed to converge to the globally optimal function value under mild assumptions. Extensive computational experiments over 500 publicly open-source test problems and one industrially-relevant application show that BAM outperforms state-of-the-art DFO algorithms regardless of problem convexity and smoothness, especially for higher-dimensional problems.",

      "abstract": "Commercial and recreational stone crab (Menippe mercenaria) fisheries primarily occur along the Gulf of Mexico and Atlantic coasts of the southeastern United States and the northeastern Caribbean. The fishery is unique in that only the crabs claws are retained and the animal is returned to the water alive. While the fishery is often regarded as sustainable because it is believed to exploit the crabs natural ability to voluntarily drop (autotomize) and regenerate lost claws, the survival of de-clawed stone crabs is often low, especially when both claws are harvested. In this study, a controlled laboratory experiment was used to compare an induced-autotomy method of claw removal to the typical forced break method currently used in the fishery. For the two different claw removal methods, we compared crab survival and start time to claw regeneration as a function of one or both claws removed. Overall, we found a significant effect of the removal method and number of claws removed on crab survival, but these factors did not influence the time to start claw regeneration. Although the induced-autotomy method was several seconds slower in processing time than the typical forced break method, it resulted in a 29% increase in survival (up to 92% survival throughout the study) compared to the typical forced break method of claw removal (63% survival throughout the study). Overall, these results suggest that the induced-autotomy method of claw removal significantly increases survival of stone crabs. \u00c2\u00a9 2023",

      "abstract": "This study evaluates the impact of the professional career construction model (CCP) on the professional practice of counselors and the social sustainability actions put into play in their professional performance. A mixed methodology featuring a predominantly qualitative approach is used to examine the employment situation and professional development of this group. Forty-eight socio-labor counselors from the autonomous community of Andalusia (Spain) participated in the self-application of the CCP model. Subsequently, a questionnaire was administered via a discussion group. The data analysis combines descriptive and qualitative procedures with the support of computer software. Strengths, weaknesses, opportunities, and threats (SWOT) analysis and triangulation techniques are used as methodological integration strategies. The resulting data are discussed, later presenting a series of limitations and prospective of the study. Relevant conclusions are provided about the impact of the CCP model on the professional careers of counselors based on their satisfaction with the self-application of the model, their career progression and employment status, and their self-perceptions of the social impact of their counseling careers. These conclusions highlight the implications of the study regarding promoting the sustainable careers of socio-labor counselors, enhancing their initial and continuous training, and facilitating their occupational actions in a complex and constantly changing society.",

      "abstract": "Rapid slope instabilities (i.e., rockfalls) involving highway networks in mountainous areas pose a threat to facilities, settlements and life, thus representing a challenge for asset management plans. To identify different morphological expressions of degradation processes that lead to rock mass destabilization, we combined satellite and uncrewed aircraft system (UAS)-based products over two study sites along the State Highway 133 sector near Paonia Reservoir, Colorado (USA). Along with a PS-InSAR analysis covering the 2017\u20132021 interval, a high-resolution dataset composed of optical, thermal and multi-spectral imagery was systematically acquired during two UAS surveys in September 2021 and June 2022. After a pre-processing step including georeferencing and orthorectification, the final products were processed through object-based multispectral classification and change detection analysis for highlighting moisture or lithological variations and for identifying areas more susceptible to deterioration and detachments at the small and micro-scale. The PS-InSAR analysis, on the other hand, provided multi-temporal information at the catchment scale and assisted in understanding the large-scale morpho-evolution of the displacements. This synergic combination offered a multiscale perspective of the superimposed imprints of denudation and mass-wasting processes occurring on the study site, leading to the detection of evidence and/or early precursors of rock collapses, and effectively supporting asset management maintenance practices.",

      "abstract": "Fixed-wing unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) and multi-rotor UAVs are widely utilized in large-area (>1 km2) environmental monitoring and small-area (<1 km2) fine vegetation surveys, respectively, having different characteristics in terms of flight cost, operational efficiency, and landing and take-off methods. However, large-area fine mapping in complex forest environments is still a challenge in UAV remote sensing. Here, we developed a method that combines a multi-rotor UAV and a fixed-wing UAV to solve this challenge at a low cost. Firstly, we acquired small-scale, multi-season ultra-high-resolution red-green-blue (RGB) images and large-area RGB images by a multi-rotor UAV and a fixed-wing UAV, respectively. Secondly, we combined the reference data of visual interpretation with the multi-rotor UAV images to construct a semantic segmentation model and used the model to expand the reference data. Finally, we classified fixed-wing UAV images using the large-area reference data combined with the semantic segmentation model and discuss the effects of different sizes. Our results show that combining multi-rotor and fixed-wing UAV imagery provides an accurate prediction of tree species. The model for fixed-wing images had an average F1 of 92.93%, with 92.00% for Quercus wutaishanica and 93.86% for Juglans mandshurica. The accuracy of the semantic segmentation model that uses a larger size shows a slight improvement, and the model has a greater impact on the accuracy of Quercus liaotungensis. The new method exploits the complementary characteristics of multi-rotor and fixed-wing UAVs to achieve fine mapping of large areas in complex environments. These results also highlight the potential of exploiting this synergy between multi-rotor UAVs and fixed-wing UAVs.",

The YOLOv5 network was used for target detection, and the results showed that using fused images achieved a higher accuracy, with a false alarm rate of 0.49% and a missed alarm rate of 0.21%.

Many methods of detecting DoS attacks in VANETs are available in the literature, but they are still hard to detect and mitigate attacks. Due to these attacks, the vehicle user cannot transmit emergency alert messages and disseminate the traffic data to the destination vehicle in due time.

      "abstract": "Low altitude platform (LAP) unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), also called drones, are currently being exploited by Edge computing (EC) systems to execute complex resource-hungry use cases, such as virtual reality, smart cities, autonomous vehicles, etc., by attaching portable edge devices on them. However, a typical drone has limited flight time, coupled with the resource-constrained attached edge device, which can jeopardize aerial computing missions if they are not holistically taking into consideration. Moreover, the fundamental challenge is how to co-schedule multi-drone among multi-location where EC services are needed, such that drones are scheduled to maximize the utility from the activities while meeting computing resource and flight time constraints. Therefore, for a given fleet of drones and tasks across disjointed target locations in a city, we derive a machine learning (ML) linear regression model that estimates these tasks resource requirement and execution time. Leveraging this estimation values, we jointly consider each drone's flight time availability and its attached edge device resource capacity, and formulate a novel Multi-Location Capacitated Mission Scheduling Problem (MLCMSP) that selects suitable drones and co-schedules their flight routes with the least total distance to visit and execute tasks at the target locations. Then, we show that faster scheduling and execution of complex tasks at each location, while considering the inter-task dependencies is important to achieve effective solution for our MLCMSP. Hence, we further propose EdgeDrones, a variant bin-packing optimization approach through gang-scheduling of inter-dependent tasks that co-schedules and co-locates tasks tightly so as to achieve faster execution time, as well as to fully utilize available resources. Extensive experiments on Alibaba cluster trace with information on task dependencies (about 12,207,703 dependencies) show that EdgeDrones achieves up to 73% higher resource utilization, up to 17.6 times faster executions, and up to 2.87 times faster flight travel time compared to the baseline approaches. \u00c2\u00a9 2023 The Author(s)",

      "abstract": "The unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) swarm is regarded as having a significant role in modern warfare. The demand for UAV swarms with the capability of attack-defense confrontation is urgent. The existing decision-making methods of UAV swarm confrontation, such as multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL), suffer from an exponential increase in training time as the size of the swarm increases. Inspired by group hunting behavior in nature, this paper presents a new bio-inspired decision-making method for UAV swarms for attack-defense confrontation via MARL. Firstly, a UAV swarm decision-making framework for confrontation based on grouping mechanisms is established. Secondly, a bio-inspired action space is designed, and a dense reward is added to the reward function to accelerate the convergence speed of training. Finally, numerical experiments are conducted to evaluate the performance of our method. The experiment results show that the proposed method can be applied to a swarm of 12 UAVs, and when the maximum acceleration of the enemy UAV is within 2.5 times ours, the swarm can well intercept the enemy, and the success rate is above 91%.",

In this article, we propose AI wings, an artificial intelligence of things (AIoT) drone system for commanding multiple unmanned aerial vehicles and deploying AI models. We integrated ArduPilot with the Android mobile platform, which equips DIY drones with AI computing power and 4G/5G connectivity. Embedded control software is developed to cooperate with the AI Wings cloud. Users can easily convert ArduPilot drones into AIoT drones using Android phones, and connect to a cloud server to create their own Internet of Drones. Our cloud server is also integrated with the drone simulation software AirSim for simulating drone missions in virtual reality (VR) worlds. The virtual simulation enables users to test software/hardware configurations as well as train AI models. Moreover, to ensure secure communication, we propose an authentication protocol based on elliptic-curve cryptography with pseudoidentities and time freshness check. In summary, AI Wings provides a cloud server for commanding drone fleets securely, software/hardware design for AIoT drones, and VR simulation for training and testing AI models. Users can install the AI models on the drones directly. To test the system, we built an experimental medical drone service, which delivers an automated external defibrillator to people with a sudden cardiac attack in the shortest time possible. \u00c2\u00a9 2007-2012 IEEE.",

      "abstract": "For tracking and motion capture (MoCap) of animals in their natural habitat, a formation of safe and silent aerial platforms, such as airships with on-board cameras, is well suited. In our prior work we derived formation properties for optimal MoCap, which include maintaining constant angular separation between observers w.r.t. the subject, threshold distance to it and keeping it centered in the camera view. Unlike multi-rotors, airships have non-holonomic constrains and are affected by ambient wind. Their orientation and flight direction are also tightly coupled. Therefore a control scheme for multicopters that assumes independence of motion direction and orientation is not applicable. In this letter, we address this problem by first exploiting a periodic relationship between the airspeed of an airship and its distance to the subject. We use it to derive analytical and numeric solutions that satisfy the formation properties for optimal MoCap. Based on this, we develop an MPC-based formation controller. We perform theoretical analysis of our solution, boundary conditions of its applicability, extensive simulation experiments and a real world demonstration of our control method with an unmanned airship. \u00c2\u00a9 2016 IEEE.",

      "abstract": "Safe driving decision-making is particularly important for automated commercial vehicles (ACVs). Small passenger vehicles pay more attention to collision prevention, while commercial vehicles with a longer brake distance and worse roll stability need to consider both anti-collision and anti-rollover. The widely studied driving decision-making methods for small passenger vehicles cannot be simply and directly applied to commercial vehicles. This article proposes a safe driving decision-making methodology based on a cascade imitation learning network (CILN). The CILN integrates two parts, namely, the supervised learning part and the imitation learning part. The first part learns safe driving maneuvers extracted from naturalistic vehicle sensor data. Through sensor data processing, it develops decision-making at a humanoid level, such as avoiding jerky driving actions. In the second part, generative adversarial imitation learning (GAIL) is introduced to further learn safe driving decisions under conditions prone to collision and rollover. Finally, both highD dataset and simulation of urban mobility (SUMO) are used to train and verify the performance of the CILN. By comparing the evaluation indicators of time to collision (TTC), reverse TTC (RTTC), deceleration rate to avoid the crash (DRAC), distance headway, and lateral acceleration, the CILN outperforms the other decision-making algorithms. Experimental results show that the CILN can provide safe driving decision-making and ensure the driving safety of ACVs in dense traffic flow. \u00c2\u00a9 2001-2012 IEEE.",

      "abstract": "Underground obstacle detection is the premise of unmanned driving. Aiming at the problem of obstacle detection in coal mines using a millimeter-wave radar, this paper proposes a filtering algorithm for invalid targets in roadways. Firstly, the target information output by millimeter-wave radar is analyzed, and the obstacle information of the underground roadway is extracted. Then, the filter algorithm is used to filter the resolved empty targets, false targets and non-potentially dangerous targets. The empty target whose target distance is zero in radar data is filtered directly. The pseudo targets generated by the radar performance or the instability of the echo signal are filtered through the radar-effective target life cycle method. The non-threatening targets beyond the horizontal range threshold and longitudinal range threshold are filtered directly. The experimental results show that the average filtering rate of the algorithm is more than 87.82% in the static state. When the speed is 5 km/h, the average filter rate is 87.70% for smooth driving and 86.83% for uneven road surfaces. When the speed is 7 km/h, the smooth driving rate is 87.54%, and the uneven road surface is 86.56%. When the speed is 10 km/h, the smooth driving rate is 86.50%, and the uneven road surface is 86.44%. Although the filter rate decreases with the increase of speed or vehicle vibration in the running state, the average filter rate of the proposed algorithm can reach more than 86% under all conditions.",

We consider the object is grasped by a set of mobile robots with double-integrator dynamics. Then, we propose a set of nominal controllers that allows reaching a desired configuration of the BB that models the deformable object. In order to prevent collisions of the object with static or dynamic obstacles, we formulate a control barrier function (CBF) that exploits our deformation model.

We report simulation results to show the performance of this approach in different test scenarios. \u00c2\u00a9 2007-2012 IEEE.",

      "abstract": "The regular detection and diagnosis mechanism for the silting disease of drainage pipelines (SDP) is critical for making dredging decisions and flood forecasting. Simultaneously, there is a complex coupling relationship between the pipeline siltation and the dynamic changes of the inlet and outlet flows. However, the traditional silting detection frameworks of drainage pipelines face difficulties in two aspects, accurate flow rate measurements and efficient and intelligent siltation diagnoses. In this paper, an automatic and integrated self-diagnosing system for the silting disease of drainage pipelines is proposed. First, a gradient penalty generative adversarial network (GPGAN), a target recognition algorithm called guided faster R-CNN (GF R-CNN) and an image segmentation method called parallel multiscale U-Net (PMSU-Net) are introduced to dynamically measure the flow of water in the drainage pipelines. Second, an automatic siltation detection and diagnosis algorithm of SDP is constructed based on a t-SNE stack sparse autoencoder (SSAE-TSNE) and multiscale long short-term memory (MS-LSTM). Then, a full-scale prototype verifies the feasibility of the system. This improved flow measurement algorithm achieves the highest accuracy of 90.32%, and an F1 score of 0.963 in comparison with the other algorithms, and the precision-recall curve was the closest to the top right corner. The error rate of the proposed self-diagnosing system is controlled within 8%, which is far better than the other algorithms. Finally, the system algorithms are embedded in an intelligent platform consisting of an unmanned pipeline measuring device (UPM), an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) and a server diagnostic centre. The practical application and test show that the accuracy, precision and response speed of the proposed integrated self-diagnosing system have obvious advantages in the function of siltation detection and diagnosis in drainage pipelines. \u00c2\u00a9 2023",

      "abstract": "Due to the features of on-demand deployment and flexible observation, unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) are promising for serving as the next-generation aerial sensors by using their onboard sensing devices. Compared to a single UAV with limited sensing coverage and communication capability, multi-UAV cooperation is able to realize more effective sensing and transmission (S&T) services, and delivers the sensory data to the control center more efficiently for further analysis. Nevertheless, most existing works on multi-UAV sensing mainly focus on mutually exclusive task allocation and independent data transmission, which did not fully exploit the benefit of multi-UAV sensing and communication. Motivated by this, we propose a novel multi-UAV cooperative S&T scheme with overlapped sensing task allocation. Although overlapped task allocation may sound counter-intuitive, it can actually foster cooperative transmission among multiple UAVs through a virtual multi-antenna system and thus reduce the overall sensing mission completion time. To obtain the optimal task allocation and transmit power of the proposed scheme, a mission completion time minimization problem is formulated. To solve this problem, a condition that specifies whether it is necessary for the UAVs to perform overlapped sensing is derived. For the cases of overlapped sensing, this time minimization problem is transformed into a monotonic optimization and is solved by the generic Polyblock algorithm. To efficiently evaluate the mission completion time in each iteration of the Polyblock algorithm, new auxiliary variables are introduced to decouple the otherwise sophisticated joint optimization of transmission time and power. While for the degenerated case of non-overlapped sensing, the closed-form expression of the optimal transmission time is derived, which provides insights into the optimal solution and facilitates the design of an efficient double-loop binary search algorithm to optimally solve the degenerated problem. Finally, simulation results demonstrate that the proposed scheme significantly reduces the mission completion time over benchmark schemes. \u00c2\u00a9 2002-2012 IEEE.",

      "abstract": "A numerical scheme is proposed for a priori generation of the optical patterns for magnetic nanoemulsion (MNE) based defect detection in ferromagnetic steel specimens. External static magnetic field (HDC) induced tunable optical contrast in MNE has been exploited for the development of the wide-area non-contact optical sensor, which utilizes the magnetic flux leakage (MFL) from the defect regions to generate visually discernible optical patterns, where the image contrast varies with the severity of the defects. For theoretically generating the optical patterns, a three-step numerical scheme is proposed, where the first step involves the physical characterization of the MNEs. In the presence of a HDC, the MNE droplets exhibit an oriented linear arrangement, where the inter-droplet separation decreases with increasing HDC, resulting in a blue shift of the wavelength corresponding to the maxima of the Bragg's reflection peaks (\u00ce\u00bbmax). Unique \u00ce\u00bbmax-HDC calibration curves are obtained for various types of MNEs depending on the nature of the stabilizing moieties. In the second step, the surface distributions of the MFL are obtained using finite element modelling. Subsequently, in the third stage, using the \u00ce\u00bbmax-HDC calibration curves, the surface distributions of MFL are converted to surface distributions of \u00ce\u00bbmax values, which are then pseudo colour-coded to theoretically generate the optical patterns. The presence of the rectangular slots, double rectangular, cylindrical, and buried defects are clearly discernible from the simulated optical patterns, which are found to be in good agreement with the experimentally recorded patterns. Defect depth-dependent intensity variations and estimated defect widths from the simulated images are in good agreement with the data obtained from the experimental images, thereby validating the efficacy of the proposed scheme for a priori prediction of the optical patterns for MNE-based non-contact wide area defect detection. Further, the proposed scheme will be beneficial for the selection of appropriate MNE-based sensors, reducing inspection time, and developing automated inspection routines with enhanced detection capabilities. \u00c2\u00a9 2023 Elsevier Ltd",

However, existing AD software frameworks are provided as complete implementations that do not follow any domain-specific safety-requirement centric development process. In this paper, we develop, for the first time, ISO 26262 dynamic views of a representative AD framework, Apollo. Dynamic views are a key element of software architectural design that links safety software requirements with their implementation, and are the basis to verify that all casuistics are properly considered in the design and tested in the validation tests. We also show that dynamic views miss key information of the execution parallelism of Apollo, needed to assess and improve execution efficiency to meet performance-related safety requirements and reduce resource utilization. We cover this gap by proposing execution views that capture the parallelism exploited by the analyzed application on the target MPSoC. Execution views improve greatly resource usage testing, which is required by ISO 26262, and allow better resource utilization contributing to the stringent cost-reduction requirements in automotive domains.",

      "abstract": "The complex electromagnetic environment makes the electromagnetic susceptibility (EMS) test challenging for the unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) data link. The EMS test can be regarded as an optimization problem to obtain the maximum signal-to-interference ratio that makes the data link losing lock. In this article, we proposed an adaptive EMS test design method based on Bayesian optimization to expand the ability of the EMS test toward the UAV data link. The sensitive electromagnetic interference parameters can be automatically searched according to the adaptive test design method. The Gaussian process is used as the surrogate model for the EMS threshold. Besides, acquisition functions are discussed, including the probability of improvement, expected improvement, and upper confidence bound to balance the exploration and exploitation. Then, two test examples are applied to verify the adaptive test design method. Compared with the traditional EMS test methods, the proposed method introducing Bayesian optimization into the EMS test design can significantly improve the test efficiency and achieve an excellent human-in-the-loop effect. \u00c2\u00a9 1964-2012 IEEE.",

      "abstract": "Background: Despite cardiovascular diseases and thrombosis being major causes of death in patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD), there remains no effective biomarker to predict thrombotic risk in this population. Objective: To evaluate global coagulation assays in patients with CKD and correlate the biomarkers to clinical outcomes. Material and methods: Patients with eGFR<30 mL/min/1.73m2 were recruited (n = 90) in this prospective observational study. Blood samples were collected for global coagulation assays, including thromboelastography, calibrated automated thrombogram (CAT), overall hemostatic potential (OHP) and tissue factor pathway inhibitor (TFPI). Results: Following adjustment for age and gender, CKD subjects (mean age 66 years, 36 % female) had increased maximum amplitude on thromboelastography (70.1 vs 60.2 mm, p < 0.001), higher peak thrombin (233.2 vs 219.7 mm, p = 0.030) and increased OHP (16.1 vs 6.4 units, p < 0.001) compared to healthy controls (n = 153). TFPI was also increased in CKD patients (36.4 vs 14.5 ng/mL, p < 0.001). Compared to hemodialysis patients (n = 43), peritoneal-dialysis patients (n = 25) had more hypercoagulable parameters. Thirty-five CKD patients reported thrombotic complications \u00e2\u0080\u0093 key predictors included dialysis, higher fibrinogen, reduced endogenous thrombin potential, elevated D-dimer and increased TFPI. Using the dialysis cohort, the predictive risk model based on the key predictors performed better than Framingham heart score and number of cardiovascular risk factors (Harrell's C-stat 0.862 vs 0.585 vs 0.565). Conclusion: CKD appears to confer a hypercoagulable state compared to healthy controls. Interestingly, reduced thrombin generation and raised TFPI was paradoxically associated with increased thrombotic risks, highlighting possible complex compensatory mechanisms within the coagulation system, which may be important in predicting clinical outcomes. \u00c2\u00a9 2023 Elsevier Ltd",

      "abstract": "This article addresses the cooperative multiunmanned aerial vehicles task assignment problem (CMTAP) with temporally coupled constraints and aims to find a feasible assignment to minimize the equivalent distances of all tasks. We first present a mixed-integer linear programming model of CMTAP. To solve the undesirable deadlocks of CMTAP, a Petri net amender is constructed based on a candidate solution, and a deadlock-free solution is equivalent to a feasible transition sequence that can be fired sequentially in the corresponding amender. With this amender, we present a Petri net-based deadlock amending method (PDAM) with polynomial time complexity to convert a deadlocked solution into a deadlock-free solution. Also, a deadlock-free hybrid estimation of distribution algorithm (DHEDA) is developed for CMTAP by embedding PDAM into the original EDA. To further improve the solution quality, we establish a local exploitation method, and an adaptive operational probability is used to balance the computational burden and local exploitation ability. Then, a match-up-based reassignment method is proposed to cope with time-sensitive targets. Finally, extensive computational experiments demonstrate that PDAM is more effective at solving deadlocks than graph-based methods, particularly for large-scale CMTAP, and DHEDA outperforms existing algorithms when solving CMTAP. \u00c2\u00a9 1965-2011 IEEE.",

      "abstract": "In this paper, a distributed, autonomous, cooperative mission-planning (DACMP) approach was proposed to focus on the problem of the real-time cooperative searching and surveillance of multiple unmanned aerial vehicles (multi-UAVs) with threats in uncertain and highly dynamic environments. To deal with this problem, a time-varying probabilistic grid graph was designed to represent the perception of a target based on its a priori dynamics. A heuristic search strategy based on pyramidal maps was also proposed. Using map information at different scales makes it easier to integrate local and global information, thereby improving the search capability of UAVs, which has not been previously considered. Moreover, we proposed an adaptive distributed task assignment method for cooperative search and surveillance tasks by considering the UAV motion environment as a potential field and modeling the effects of uncertain maps and targets on candidate solutions through potential field values. The results highlight the advantages of search task execution efficiency. In addition, simulations of different scenarios show that the proposed approach can provide a feasible solution for multiple UAVs in different situations and is flexible and stable in time-sensitive environments.",

      "abstract": "There are several major threats to crop production. As herbicide use has become overly reliant on weed control, herbicide-resistant weeds have evolved and pose an increasing threat to the environment, food safety, and human health. Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have demonstrated exceptional results in the analysis of images for the identification of weeds from crop images that are captured by drones. Manually designing such neural architectures is, however, an error-prone and time-consuming process. Natural-inspired optimization algorithms have been widely used to design and optimize neural networks, since they can perform a blackbox optimization process without explicitly formulating mathematical formulations or providing gradient information to develop appropriate representations and search paradigms for solutions. Harris Hawk Optimization algorithms (HHO) have been developed in recent years to identify optimal or near-optimal solutions to difficult problems automatically, thus overcoming the limitations of human judgment. A new automated architecture based on DenseNet-121 and DenseNet-201 models is presented in this study, which is called \u201cDenseHHO\u201d. A novel CNN architecture design is devised to classify weed images captured by sprayer drones using the Harris Hawk Optimization algorithm (HHO) by selecting the most appropriate parameters. Based on the results of this study, the proposed method is capable of detecting weeds in unstructured field environments with an average accuracy of 98.44% using DenseNet-121 and 97.91% using DenseNet-201, the highest accuracy among optimization-based weed-detection strategies.",

      "abstract": "Global warming and climate change are responsible for many disasters. Floods pose a serious risk and require immediate management and strategies for optimal response times. Technology can respond in place of humans in emergencies by providing information. As one of these emerging artificial intelligence (AI) technologies, drones are controlled in their amended systems by unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs). In this study, we propose a secure method of flood detection in Saudi Arabia using a Flood Detection Secure System (FDSS) based on deep active learning (DeepAL) based classification model in federated learning to minimize communication costs and maximize global learning accuracy. We use blockchain-based federated learning and partially homomorphic encryption (PHE) for privacy protection and stochastic gradient descent (SGD) to share optimal solutions. InterPlanetary File System (IPFS) addresses issues with limited block storage and issues posed by high gradients of information transmitted in blockchains. In addition to enhancing security, FDSS can prevent malicious users from compromising or altering data. Utilizing images and IoT data, FDSS can train local models that detect and monitor floods. A homomorphic encryption technique is used to encrypt each locally trained model and gradient to achieve ciphertext-level model aggregation and model filtering, which ensures that the local models can be verified while maintaining privacy. The proposed FDSS enabled us to estimate the flooded areas and track the rapid changes in dam water levels to gauge the flood threat. The proposed methodology is straightforward, easily adaptable, and offers recommendations for Saudi Arabian decision-makers and local administrators to address the growing danger of flooding. This study concludes with a discussion of the proposed method and its challenges in managing floods in remote regions using artificial intelligence and blockchain technology.",

      "abstract": "As a promising technology, connected and autonomous vehicle (CAV) can reduce energy consumption and improve transportation safety. Nevertheless, as more enabling technologies are embedded in vehicles, the CAV is becoming more vulnerable to cybersecurity threats. Priority must be given to highly sensitive, life-threatening vulnerabilities. Therefore, an improved vulnerability assessment method for CAVs is proposed in this article, in which the common vulnerability scoring system (CVSS) and Bayes theory are adopted. Compared to the classical CVSS method, our scheme considers the impact of exploited vulnerabilities on the real world. In the meantime, a Bayesian network vulnerability classification model based on the CVSS CAV method is designed to resolve the problem that the CAVs' vulnerability dataset is small and incomplete. The case study as well as simulation results with different datasets or algorithms indicate that our proposal is effective for vehicle vulnerability evaluation. \u00c2\u00a9 2007-2012 IEEE.",

To address these issues, this study proposes an expert experience storage mechanism that improves the algorithm\u2019s performance with less experience replay time. Based on this mechanism, a maneuver decision algorithm using the Dueling Double Deep Q Network is introduced. Simulation experiments demonstrate that the proposed mechanism significantly enhances the algorithm\u2019s performance by reducing the experience by 81.3% compared to the prioritized experience replay mechanism, enabling the UAV agent to achieve a higher maximum average reward value. The experimental results suggest that the proposed expert experience storage mechanism improves the algorithm\u2019s performance with less experience replay time. Additionally, the proposed maneuver decision algorithm identifies the optimal policy for attacking target UAVs using different fixed strategies.",

To overcome this challenge, the statistics and control theory based unscented Kalman filter (UKF) exploits a deterministic sampling technique known as the unscented transformation (UT) and sigma point to estimate the non-linear system. Quadrotor UAVs are considered as a traditional system containing high complexity non-linear state. Therefore, this paper studies the IMU sensor fusion and predicts the flight trajectory through the UKF method, and treat them as a random bias issue. First, the kinematic model is established to obtain the Euler angles on the attitude of roll, pitch, and yaw for the first calculation and calibration. Subsequently, the noise and simulated fault are joined for computation. In the future, predictions from our ongoing experiments can be utilized to determine the threshold value for triggering a fault alarm.",

      "abstract": "Unsupervised domain adaptive object detection is a challenging perception task where object detectors are adapted from a label-rich source domain to an unlabeled target domain, playing a vital role in autonomous driving and robot navigation. Since the camera settings, weather, and light conditions vary depending on the road, it is labor-intensive and impossible to manually annotate all the data to adapt to these scenarios. Recent advances demonstrate the effectiveness of adversarial-based domain alignment, where domain invariance in the feature space is produced by adversarial training between the feature extractor and domain discriminator. However, due to the domain shift, domain discrimination, especially on low-level features, is an easy task. This results in an imbalance of the adversarial training between the domain discriminator and the feature extractor. In this work, we achieve a better domain alignment by introducing an auxiliary regularization task to improve the training balance. Specifically, we propose Adversarial Image Reconstruction (AIR) as the regularizer to facilitate the adversarial training of the feature extractor. We further design a multi-level Feature Alignment(A) module to enhance the adaptation performance. We refer our work as AIRA-DA for ease of presentation. Our evaluations across several datasets of challenging domain shifts demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms all previous methods, of both one-and two-stage, in most settings. Extensive experiments shows that the proposed method is capable of handling weather variation, cross-camera adaptation and synthetic-to-real-world adaptation. \u00c2\u00a9 2016 IEEE.",

      "abstract": "The unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) swarm is widely applied in many fields, such as disaster relief and geological exploration. However, it is highly vulnerable when facing an attack from internal malicious UAVs due to the underlying disconnected, intermittent, and limited (DIL) network environment. Recently, building trusted networks has been considered as a strategy to address security issues. Nevertheless, deploying a trusted network in a swarm faces many challenges imposed by the dynamic topology and limited resources of DIL networks. In order to overcome these challenges, we developed a blockchain-based UAV trusted self-organizing networking mechanism (BC-UTSON) to enhance internal security. Three key technologies are proposed for assisting BC-UTSON in achieving trustworthiness. UAV practical Byzantine fault tolerance (U-PBFT) is proposed to guarantee the lightweight consensus and real-time full-node trustworthiness evaluation under the hierarchical self-organizing networking structure of a UAV swarm. A blockchain-based multiweighted subjective logic (BMWSL) scheme has been designed to identify malicious UAV nodes based on the trustworthiness evaluation, which also assists the trusted path quality-aware dynamic routing (TPDR) mechanism to prevent data from routing through malicious nodes. The experimental results show that the proposed BC-UTSON performs much better than nonblockchain-based mechanisms for the UAV swarm. \u00c2\u00a9 2005-2012 IEEE.",

      "abstract": "Ventricular Arrhythmia (VA) is a leading cause of sudden cardiac death (SCD), which kills an average of 180,000 to 350,000 people annually, accounting for 15%\u00e2\u0080\u009320% of all deaths. Furthermore, fewer than 6% of those who experience sudden cardiac arrest outside the hospital survive, compared to 24% of those who experience SCD inside a hospital. To aid in earlier detection and improve outcomes for out-of-hospital cardiac events, an automated passive detection system for these events could be used. Such automated detection would allow users to raise their self-awareness of potential cardiac risks in life-threatening situations. Diagnosis and detection of heart dysfunctions at early stages can help to prevent complications of a patient's condition. In this work, we propose VANet and design framework for ECG-related application, a small-scale deep learning-based real-time inference solution for VA detection. VANet achieves milliseconds scale inference speed on various platforms, including desktop CPUs, mobile devices, micro-controllers, and devices with constrained computation resources. It only requires a minimum of 13 kb of storage space and 34 kb of available run-time, making it small enough to be integrated into portable devices such as smartwatches and other Internet of Things (IoT) medical monitoring devices. VANet can trigger an alarm whenever it is necessary to alert someone with cardiac dysfunction. VANet leverages optimization techniques, such as residual connections, and architecture designs, such as transformers and RNNs, to maximize neural network performance and minimize computational and storage costs. Our architecture achieved a 96.89% accuracy using multiple different ECG collection devices. \u00c2\u00a9 2023",

The proposed algorithm is developed based on the multi-agent deep deterministic policy gradient (MADDPG) algorithm, with modifications made to the action and state space to fit the setting of AGV activities. While previous studies overlooked the energy efficiency of AGVs, this paper develops a well-designed reward function that helps to optimize the overall energy consumption required to fulfill all tasks. Moreover, we incorporate the e-greedy exploration strategy into the proposed algorithm to balance exploration and exploitation during training, which helps it converge faster and achieve better performance. The proposed MARL algorithm is equipped with carefully selected parameters that aid in avoiding obstacles, speeding up path planning, and achieving minimal energy consumption. To demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm, three types of numerical experiments including the \u03f5-greedy MADDPG, MADDPG, and Q-Learning methods were conducted. The results show that the proposed algorithm can effectively solve the multi-AGV task assignment and path planning problems, and the energy consumption results show that the planned routes can effectively improve energy efficiency.",

Firstly, we describe the GPS signal dataset acquisition and preprocessing methods; these include the hardware system of the UAV and the jammer used in the experiment, the time and weather conditions of the data collection, the use of Spearman correlation coefficients for preprocessing, and the use of SVM-SMOTE to solve the spoofing data imbalance. Next, we introduce a PCA-CNN-LSTM model. We used principal component analysis (PCA) of the model to extract feature information related to spoofing from the GPS signal dataset. The convolutional neural network (CNN) in the model was used to extract local features in the GPS signal dataset, and long short-term memory (LSTM) was used as a posterior module of the CNN for further processing and modeling. To minimize randomness and chance in the simulation experiments, we used the 10-fold cross-validation method to train and evaluate the computational performance of our spoofing machine learning model. We conducted a series of experiments in a numerical simulation environment and evaluated the proposed model against the most advanced traditional machine learning and deep learning models. The results and analysis show that the PCA-CNN-LSTM neural network model achieved the highest accuracy (0.9949). This paper provides a theoretical basis and technical support for spoofing detection for small-UAV GPS signals.",

      "abstract": "Flying Ad-Hoc Network (FANET) formed by a swarm of Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) is currently a trending research topic because of its capability in performing complex tasks more rapidly and efficiently. However, the high-speed mobility of UAVs, limited energy, and dynamically changing topology have led to critical challenges for the reliability of communication between UAVs, especially when designing routing schemes in FANET. In this paper, we introduce a Mobility-based Weighted Cluster Routing Scheme (MWCRSF) for FANET performance enhancement within the constraints of network resources. MWCRSF utilizes the high-level search efficiency of the Sparrow Search Algorithm (SSA) and a new clustering algorithm based on SSA is first proposed to set up the initial UAV clusters. A weighted sum-based algorithm is then proposed for Cluster Head (CH) selection, where the residual energy, node correlation degree, relative mobility, distance to the Base Station (BS), and average distance are adopted as the selection criteria. To keep the UAV clusters updated, an efficient cluster maintenance algorithm is proposed as well. In order to provide timely and reliable data transmission to the BS, the optimal next-hop route selection is performed considering the link lifetime, residual energy, and distance between nodes and BS. We exploit the power of skyline operators in multi-criteria decision-making to reduce the search space and improve the efficiency of CH selection and next-hop routing. The simulation results reveal that the proposed MWCRSF scheme outperforms the existing methods under different metrics including cluster lifetime, energy efficiency, throughput, and network lifetime. \u00c2\u00a9 2023 Elsevier Inc.",

Therefore, this article addresses the problem of path planning and control of autonomous vehicles in a dynamic adversarial reach-avoid scenario with two noncooperative vehicles and their competitive objectives: 1) 'reaching a target and avoiding the other vehicle' for one of them, called attacker, and 2) 'protecting the target and capturing the opponent vehicle' for the other one, called defender. In the proposed solution, first, a discrete version of the problem is formulated and solved using linear temporal logic, temporal games, and $\\mu$-calculus to construct winning discrete strategies that guarantee safety and reachability. A comprehensive discussion on the existence, correctness, and complexity analysis of the solution is also provided. Finally, a novel correct-by-design hybrid controller is designed to generate smooth control signals that preserve the satisfaction of safety and reachability. \u00c2\u00a9 1963-2012 IEEE.",

      "abstract": "The inclusion of drones in Internet of Vehicles (IoV) is a current trend that presents significant trade-offs. On the one hand, Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) provide advantages such as enabling ground communications also when physical obstacles limit the connectivity. On the other hand, they increase the attack surface. For instance, physical attacks on drones provide the attacker with credentials that can be used to inject bogus information into the IoV network, thus jeopardizing not only security but also users' safety. In this scenario, authentication plays a fundamental role to guarantee security. It is however fundamental to develop authentication protocols that can, at the same time, protect ground users' data and prevent attacks to drones. However, currently available authentication schemes cannot guarantee security in case of attacks to drones. In this paper, we propose a Blockchain-supported authentication protocol for Drone-assisted IoV using Elliptic curve cryptography (BDIVE). Compared to existing authentication protocols, we extend the threat model from an honest-but-curious drone to active attacks against drones. BDIVE provides both energy-efficiency, traceability, and accountability thanks to the use of blockchain at the Trusted Authority (TA). Using Burrow-Abadi-Needham (BAN) logic, we analyze and prove the security of mutual authentication in BDIVE. We also prove the security of BDIVE against several attacks by implementing it in AVISPA. To assess its scalability and energy efficiency, we implement BDIVE using Omnetpp with its Castalia simulator. The comparison of BDIVE with currently existing authentication protocols, shows that it reduces the energy consumption up to 70% and the computational cost up to 68%, while providing resistance to previously unconsidered attack vectors. \u00c2\u00a9 2004-2012 IEEE.",

      "abstract": "Pine wild disease poses a serious threat to the ecological environment of national forests. Combining the object detection algorithm with Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAV) to detect pine wild diseased trees (PWDT) is a significant step in preventing the spread of pine wild disease. To address the issue of shallow feature layers lacking the ability to fully extract features from small-sized diseased trees in existing detection algorithms, as well as the problem of a small number of small-sized diseased trees in a single image, a Shallow Pooled Weighted Feature Enhancement Network (SPW-FEN) based on Small Target Expansion (STE) has been proposed for detecting PWDT. First, a Pooled Weighted Channel Attention (PWCA) module is presented and introduced into the shallow feature layer with rich small target information to enhance the network\u2019s expressive ability regarding the characteristics of two-layer shallow feature maps. Additionally, an STE data enhancement method is introduced for small-sized targets, which effectively increases the sample size of small-sized diseased trees in a single image. The experimental results on the PWDT dataset indicate that the proposed algorithm achieved an average precision and recall of 79.1% and 86.9%, respectively. This is 3.6 and 3.8 percentage points higher, respectively, than the recognition recall and average precision of the existing state-of-the-art method Faster-RCNN, and 6.4 and 5.5 percentage points higher than those of the newly proposed YOLOv6 method.",

      "abstract": "Vision-based localization is an essential problem for autonomous systems while the performance of vision-based odometry degrades in the challenging scenario. This letter presents S-VIO, an RGB-D visual inertial odometry (VIO) which fully uses multi-sensor measurements (i.e. depth, RGB and IMU), heterogeneous landmarks (i.e. points, lines and planes) and structural regularity of the environment to obtain a robust and accurate localization result. In order to detect the underlying structural regularity of the environment, a two-step Atlanta world inference method is proposed. Leveraging the gravity direction estimated by the VIO system, the proposed algorithm first generates horizontal Atlanta axis hypotheses from a set of recently optimized plane landmarks. Then the following plane landmarks and line clusters are used to filter out the occasionally observed axes based on the persistence of the observation. The remaining axes will survive and be saved in the Atlanta map for future re-observations. Particularly, an efficient mined-and-stabbed (MnS) method is applied to classify the structural line and extract the vanishing point from each line cluster. In addition, a closed-form initialization method for the structural line feature is proposed, which leverages the known direction to obtain a better initial estimation. Integrated with the above novelties, S-VIO is tested on two public real-world RGB-D inertial datasets. Experiments demonstrate that S-VIO has better accuracy and robustness compared to state-of-the-art VIO and RGB-D VIO algorithms. \u00c2\u00a9 2016 IEEE.",

      "abstract": "Recent advances in technology have led to a surge in interest in unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), which are remote-controlled aircraft that rely on cameras or sensors to gather information about their surroundings during flight. A UAV requires a path-planning technique that can swiftly recalculate a viable and quasi-optimal path in flight if a new obstacle or hazard is recognized or if the target is moved during the mission. In brief, the planning of UAV routes might optimize a specific problem determined by the application, such as the moving target problem (MTP), flight time and threats, or multiobjective navigation. The complexity of MTP ranges from NP-hard to NEXP-complete because there are so many probabilistic variables involved. Therefore, it is hard to detect a high-quality solution for this problem using traditional techniques such as differential calculus. Therefore, this paper hybridizes differential evolution (DE) with two newly proposed updating schemes to present a new evolution-based technique named hybrid differential evolution (HDE) for accurately tackling the MTP in a reasonable amount of time. Using Bayesian theory, the MTP can be transformed into an optimization problem by employing the target detection probability as the fitness function. The proposed HDE encodes the search trajectory as a sequence of UAV motion pathways that evolve with increasing the current iteration for finding the near-optimal solution, which could maximize this fitness function. The HDE is extensively compared to the classical DE and several rival optimizers in terms of several performance metrics across four different scenarios with varying degrees of difficulty. This comparison demonstrates the proposal\u2019s superiority in terms of the majority of used performance metrics.",

      "abstract": "UAV swarms will profoundly shape the pattern of warfare. In order to improve the autonomous decision-making algorithm capability of UAV swarms, the autonomous decision-making method for heterogeneous UAV swarm attack-defense confrontation scenarios is studied. An overview of the design of the UAV swarm confrontation model and the model design of the UAV swarm attack-defense confrontation scenario are carried out. To solve the sparse reward problem which widely exists in the reinforcement learning technology in the autonomous decision-making of the UAV swarm, a reward mechanism setting method based on local reward reshaping is proposed. And then, the prioritized experience replay is superimposed, which effectively improves the sparse reward problem. Finally, the superiority of this method is verified by simulation and demonstration system design. This study will accelerate the network convergence process of the autonomous decision-making algorithm for UAV swarms based on reinforcement learning technology, which is of great significance to the research on autonomous decision-making algorithms of UAV swarms. \u00c2\u00a9 2023 China Ordnance Society.

      "abstract": "Autonomous vehicles typically transmit information over wireless communication network, which is vulnerable to malicious cyber attacks and poses huge security threats for autonomous vehicles. To address these challenges, this paper is concerned with resilient H\u00e2\u0088\u009e path-following control problem for autonomous vehicles under false data injection (FDI) attacks and denial-of-service (DoS) attacks, simultaneously. Firstly, a novel observer is constructed to estimate both sensor FDI attack signal and system state. An attack parameter dependent time-varying piecewise Lyapunov function is constructed to ensure stability of the underlying system. Then, a resilient H\u00e2\u0088\u009e path-following control scheme is developed to suppress the impact of FDI attacks and external interference despite the presence of intermittent DoS attacks. The design criterion of resilient controller is derived to assure the exponential stability of the closed-loop system and maintain the desired H\u00e2\u0088\u009e performance. Finally, simulation studies are carried out to verify the efficiency and merits of the developed results. \u00c2\u00a9 2023 Elsevier Ltd",

      "abstract": "Wildfire poses a significant threat and is considered a severe natural disaster, which endangers forest resources, wildlife, and human livelihoods. In recent times, there has been an increase in the number of wildfire incidents, and both human involvement with nature and the impacts of global warming play major roles in this. The rapid identification of fire starting from early smoke can be crucial in combating this issue, as it allows firefighters to respond quickly to the fire and prevent it from spreading. As a result, we proposed a refined version of the YOLOv7 model for detecting smoke from forest fires. To begin, we compiled a collection of 6500 UAV pictures of smoke from forest fires. To further enhance YOLOv7\u2019s feature extraction capabilities, we incorporated the CBAM attention mechanism. Then, we added an SPPF+ layer to the network\u2019s backbone to better concentrate smaller wildfire smoke regions. Finally, decoupled heads were introduced into the YOLOv7 model to extract useful information from an array of data. A BiFPN was used to accelerate multi-scale feature fusion and acquire more specific features. Learning weights were introduced in the BiFPN so that the network can prioritize the most significantly affecting characteristic mapping of the result characteristics. The testing findings on our forest fire smoke dataset revealed that the proposed approach successfully detected forest fire smoke with an AP50 of 86.4%, 3.9% higher than previous single- and multiple-stage object detectors.",

      "abstract": "The underwater environment is a harmful environment, yet one of the richest and least exploited. For these reasons the idea of a robotic companion with the task of supporting and monitoring divers during their activities and operations has been proposed. However, the idea of a platoon of robots at the diver\u2019s disposal has never been fully addressed in these proposals due to the high cost of implementation and the usability, weight and bulk of the robots. Nevertheless, recent advancements in swarm robotics, materials engineering, deep learning, and the decreasing cost of autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs), have rendered this concept increasingly viable. Therefore, this paper introduces, in the first part, a novel framework that integrates a revised version of a gesture-based language for underwater human\u2013robot interaction (Caddian) based on insights gained from extensive field trials. The newly introduced objective of this framework is to enable the cooperation and coordination of an AUV team by one or more human operators, while allowing a human operator to delegate a robot leader to instruct the other robotic team members. The work, in the second part, provides an evaluation of the new language proposed thanks to a fifty million sentence corpus and describes a comparison framework, which is used to estimate it with respect to other existing underwater human\u2013robot interaction languages.",

In this regard, the main contribution is a symbolic/numeric application of the multiplicity-induced-dominancy property in the control of unmanned aerial vehicles rotorcrafts featuring time-delays. The multiplicity-induced-dominancy property is considered to address two of the most representative aerial robotic platforms: a classical quadrotor vehicle and a quadrotor vehicle endowed with tilting rotors. The aforementioned property leads to an effective delayed feedback control design (multiplicity-induced-dominancy tuning criteria), allowing the system to meet prescribed behavior conditions based on the placement of the rightmost root of the corresponding closed-loop characteristic function/quasipolynomial. Lastly, the results of detailed numerical simulations, including the linear and non-linear dynamics of the vehicle, are presented and discussed to validate the proposal. \u00c2\u00a9 The Author(s) 2022.",

Considering cyber attacks, a new event-based formation control strategy is developed for multi-UAV systems under directed topology by utilizing a control compensation approach. Sufficient conditions for the multi-UAV system to achieve the desired formation are acquired.

A nonlinear model predictive impedance control (NMPIC) method is proposed to achieve the goal in which the controller is able to simultaneously handle the constraints and maintain the compliant behavior. The design of NMPIC is the combination of a nonlinear model predictive control and impedance control based on the dynamics of the system. A disturbance observer is exploited to estimate the external wrench and then provide compensation for the model which was employed in the controller. Moreover, a weight adaptive strategy is proposed to perform the online tuning of the weighting matrix of the cost function within the optimal problem of NMPIC to improve the performance and stability. The effectiveness and advantages of the proposed method are validated by several simulations in different scenarios compared with the general impedance controller. The results also indicate that the proposed method opens a novel way for interaction force regulation.",

      "abstract": "Plant diseases are one of the major threats to global food production. Efficient monitoring and detection of plant pathogens are instrumental in restricting and effectively managing the spread of the disease and reducing the cost of pesticides. Traditional, molecular, and serological methods that are widely used for plant disease detection are often ineffective if not applied during the initial stages of pathogenesis, when no or very weak symptoms appear. Moreover, they are almost useless in acquiring spatialized diagnostic results on plant diseases. On the other hand, remote sensing (RS) techniques utilizing drones are very effective for the rapid identification of plant diseases in their early stages. Currently, drones, play a pivotal role in the monitoring of plant pathogen spread, detection, and diagnosis to ensure crops\u2019 health status. The advantages of drone technology include high spatial resolution (as several sensors are carried aboard), high efficiency, usage flexibility, and more significantly, quick detection of plant diseases across a large area with low cost, reliability, and provision of high-resolution data. Drone technology employs an automated procedure that begins with gathering images of diseased plants using various sensors and cameras. After extracting features, image processing approaches use the appropriate traditional machine learning or deep learning algorithms. Features are extracted from images of leaves using edge detection and histogram equalization methods. Drones have many potential uses in agriculture, including reducing manual labor and increasing productivity. Drones may be able to provide early warning of plant diseases, allowing farmers to prevent costly crop failures.",

      "abstract": "Automotive-Industry 5.0 will use Beyond Fifth-Generation (B5G) communications to provide robust, abundant computation resources and energy-efficient data sharing among various Intelligent Transportation System (ITS) entities. Based on the vehicle communication network, the Internet of Vehicles (IoV) is created, where vehicles\u00e2\u0080\u0099 resources, including processing, storage, sensing, and communication units, can be leveraged to construct Vehicular Cloudlet (VC) to realize resource sharing. As Connected and Autonomous Vehicles (CAV) onboard computing is becoming more potent, VC resources (comprising stationary and moving vehicles\u00e2\u0080\u0099 idle resources) seems a promising solution to tackle the incessant computing requirements of vehicles. Furthermore, such spare computing resources can significantly reduce task requests\u00e2\u0080\u0099 delay and transmission costs. In order to maximize the utility of task requests in the system under the maximum time constraint, this paper proposes a Secondary Resource Allocation (SRA) mechanism based on a dual time scale. The request service process is regarded as M/M/1 queuing model and considers each task request in the same time slot as an agent. A Partially Observable Markov Decision Process (POMDP) is constructed and combined with the Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL) algorithm known as QMix, which exploits the overall vehicle state and queue state to reach effective computing resource allocation decisions. There are two main performance metrics: the system's total utility and task completion rate. Simulation results reveal that the task completion rate is increased by 13%. Furthermore, compared with the deep deterministic policy optimization method, our proposed algorithm can improve the overall utility value by 70% and the task completion rate by 6%. \u00c2\u00a9 2022 The Author(s)",

      "abstract": "This article focuses on the issue of adaptive multievent-triggered fuzzy dynamic positioning control of unmanned surface vehicles against denial-of-service attacks within a finite-time interval. To improve the data transmission efficiency, an innovative adaptive multievent-triggered mechanism is designed to dynamically adjust the event-triggered thresholds. Especially, the asynchrony between the membership functions of the controller and that of the system is embedded into the adaptive multievent-triggered mechanism, which can help to reduce the conservatism of controller design attributed to mismatched membership functions. By employing the linear matrix inequality technology, sufficient conditions are derived to ensure that the switched closed-loop fuzzy dynamic positioning system is finite-time bounded with an H\u00e2\u0088\u009e noise attenuation performance. To clarify the validity of the presented positioning controller under the adaptive multievent-triggered mechanism and denial-of-service attacks, we provide and analyze the simulation results. \u00c2\u00a9 2014 IEEE.",

      "abstract": "In this study, we develop a comprehensive framework to model the impact of cyberattacks on safety, security, and head-to-tail stability of connected and automated vehicular platoons. First, we propose a general platoon dynamics model with heterogeneous time delays that may originate from the communication channel and/or vehicle onboard sensors. Based on the proposed dynamics model, we develop an augmented state extended Kalman filter (ASEKF) to smooth sensor readings, and use it in conjunction with an anomaly detector to detect sensor anomalies. Specifically, we consider two detectors: a parametric detector, the \u00cf\u00872-detector, and a learning-based detector, the one class support vector machine (OCSVM). We investigate the detection power of all combinations of vehicle dynamics models (EKF and ASEKF) and detectors (\u00cf\u00872 and OCSVM). Furthermore, we introduce a novel concept in string stability, namely, pseudo string stability, to measure a platoon's string stability under cyberattacks and model uncertainties. We demonstrate the relationship between the pseudo string stability of a platoon and its detection rate, which enables us to identify the critical detection sensitivity/recall that the platoon's members should meet for the platoon to remain pseudo string stable. \u00c2\u00a9 2023 Elsevier Ltd",

      "abstract": "Internet of Things (IoT) systems cooperative with unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) have been put into use for more than ten years, from transportation to military surveillance, and they have been shown to be worthy of inclusion in the next wireless protocols. Therefore, this paper studies user clustering and the fixed power allocation approach by placing multi-antenna UAV-mounted relays for extended coverage areas and achieving improved performance for IoT devices. In particular, the system enables UAV-mounted relays with multiple antennas together with non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) to provide a potential way to enhance transmission reliability. We presented two cases of multi-antenna UAVs such as maximum ratio transmission and the best selection to highlight the benefits of the antenna-selections approach with low-cost design. In addition, the base station managed its IoT devices in practical scenarios with and without direct links. For two cases, we derive closed-form expressions of outage probability (OP) and closed-form approximation ergodic capacity (EC) generated for both devices in the main scenario. The outage and ergodic capacity performances in some scenarios are compared to confirm the benefits of the considered system. The number of antennas was found to have a crucial impact on the performances. The simulation results show that the OP for both users strongly decreases when the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), number of antennas, and fading severity factor of Nakagami-m fading increase. The proposed scheme outperforms the orthogonal multiple access (OMA) scheme in outage performance for two users. The analytical results match Monte Carlo simulations to confirm the exactness of the derived expressions.",

Using the relative position between the obstacle and USV and the information of the closest point of approach (CPA), high-dimensional state features including the collision track layer and collision threat layer were constructed. On this basis, combined with low-dimensional states such as navigation state and path error, a deep convolutional neural network (CNN) structure fused in multifeature and multiscale was designed. The proposed DRL network was trained through repeated collision avoidance simulations in random environments.

Specifically, UAVs are being used in conjunction with machine learning techniques to solve a variety of complex agricultural problems. This paper provides a careful survey of more than 70 studies that have applied machine learning techniques utilizing UAV imagery to solve agricultural problems. The survey examines the models employed, their applications, and their performance, spanning a wide range of agricultural tasks, including crop classification, crop and weed detection, cropland mapping, and field segmentation. Comparisons are made among supervised, semi-supervised, and unsupervised machine learning approaches, including traditional machine learning classifiers, convolutional neural networks (CNNs), single-stage detectors, two-stage detectors, and transformers. Lastly, future advancements and prospects for UAV utilization in precision agriculture are highlighted and discussed. The general findings of the paper demonstrate that, for simple classification problems, traditional machine learning techniques, CNNs, and transformers can be used, with CNNs being the optimal choice. For segmentation tasks, UNETs are by far the preferred approach. For detection tasks, two-stage detectors delivered the best performance. On the other hand, for dataset augmentation and enhancement, generative adversarial networks (GANs) were the most popular choice.",

      "abstract": "The integrity of offshore structures is prone to the threat of drifting sea ice. By exciting the natural frequencies of the ice\u00e2\u0080\u0093structure interaction system, severe vibrations may occur. For a better understanding of how dynamic ice\u00e2\u0080\u0093structure interaction affects the system properties, a stochastic subspace system identification technique, SSI-cov is introduced to identify modal parameters during dynamic ice\u00e2\u0080\u0093structure interactions. Due to the uncertain input variables of SSI-cov, the identified modal parameters suffer from the quantitative judgment of the analyst. To address this problem, this study proposes an uncertainty analysis (UA) framework to obtain estimates of modal parameters. This framework constitutes both a sensitivity analysis (SA) and a UA. First, SA is applied to pick up the input variables that contribute the most to the identified modal parameters. Next, the important variables are left free to vary over their range of existence to obtain the modal parameters\u00e2\u0080\u0099 uncertainties. The framework is applied to full-scale tests from Norstr\u00c3\u00b6msgrund lighthouse and model tests carried out in Hamburg Ship Model Basin (HSVA).

We argue that some corner cases originate from a \u00e2\u0080\u009cnarrow AI\u00e2\u0080\u009d approach, which lacks the general knowledge that humans exploit when dealing with these cases. We propose an alternative that can be seen as a step toward features of Artificial General Intelligence. We exploit the biological principle of affordance competition in layered control architectures to create an artificial agent that realizes emergent, adaptive, and logical behaviors without programming case-specific rules or algorithms. We give six different examples of simple and complex emergent behaviors. For the case study of merge scenarios, we contrast the approach of this paper with an algorithmic solution of the literature. The ideas presented here (if not the whole agent's sensorimotor organization) could be used to improve the robustness and flexibility of self-driving technology. \u00c2\u00a9 2022 The Author(s)",

      "abstract": "This paper examines the performance of a wireless system where two reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (RISs) and an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) are combined to aid multiple ground users adopting nonorthogonal multiple access (NOMA) scheme. Specifically, the UAV acts as an aerial relay station, the first and the second RISs are respectively used to aid ground-to-air (G2A) and air-to-ground (A2G) communications. Besides the reflected link from the RISs, the direct link between a ground base station (S) and the UAV, the UAV and ground users are exploited to increase the received power at UAV and ground users. We successfully derive the theoretical formulas of outage probability (OP) and ergodic capacity (EC) of RIS-aided G2A/A2G-NOMA system over Nakagami-m fading channel. The derived formulas are validated by Monte-Carlo simulations, and the impacts of system parameters on the OP and EC are fully evaluated to achieve useful insights into the system behaviors. Numerical results clarify that by using two RISs where every RIS is equipped with 100 reflecting elements (REs), the OP of RIS-aided G2A/A2G-NOMA system is greatly lower than the OP of the G2A/A2G-NOMA system without RISs, in which there are only S-UAV and UAV-ground users direct links. In the case of EC, the benefit of using RISs focuses on a low transmit power regime. It is because the EC of the RIS-aided G2A/A2G-NOMA system is only higher than the EC of the system without RISs in the low transmit power region. For the high transmit power regions, the ECs with and without RISs are similar. \u00c2\u00a9 2023 Elsevier B.V.",

      "abstract": "The increasing demand for safe and efficient maritime transportation has underscored the necessity of developing effective path-planning algorithms for Unmanned Surface Vehicles (USVs). However, the inherent complexities of the ocean environment and the non-holonomic properties of the physical system have posed significant challenges to designing feasible paths for USVs. To address these issues, a novel path planning framework is elaborately designed, which consists of an optimization model, a meta-heuristic solver, and a Clothoid-based path connector. First, by encapsulating the intricate nature of the ocean environment and ship dynamics, a multi-objective path planning problem is designed, providing a comprehensive and in-depth portrayal of the underlying mechanism. By integrating the principles of the candidate set random testing initialization and adaptive probability set, an enhanced genetic algorithm is devised to fully exploit the underlying optimization problem in constrained space, contributing to the global searching ability. Accounting for the non-holonomic constraints, the fast-discrete Clothoid curve is capable of maintaining and improving the continuity of the path curve, thereby promoting strong coordination between the planning and control modules. A thorough series of simulations and comparisons conducted in diverse ocean scenarios has conclusively demonstrated the effectiveness and superiority of the proposed path planning framework.",

      "abstract": "Assisted and automated driving functions in vehicles exploit sensor data to build situational awareness, however, the data amount required by these functions might exceed the bandwidth of current wired vehicle communication networks. Consequently, sensor data reduction, and automotive camera video compression need investigation. However, conventional video compression schemes, such as H.264 and H.265, have been mainly optimised for human vision. In this paper, we propose a semantic-aware (SA) video compression (SAC) framework that compresses separately and simultaneously region-of-interest and region-out-of-interest of automotive camera video frames, before transmitting them to processing unit(s), where the data are used for perception tasks, such as object detection, semantic segmentation, etc. Using our newly proposed technique, the region-of-interest (ROI), encapsulating most of the road stakeholders, retains higher quality using lower compression ratio. The experimental results show that under the same overall compression ratio, our proposed SAC scheme maintains a similar or better image quality, measured accordingly to traditional metrics and to our newly proposed semantic-aware metrics. The newly proposed metrics, namely SA-PSNR, SA-SSIM, and iIoU, give more emphasis to ROI quality, which has an immediate impact on the planning and decisions of assisted and automated driving functions. Using our SA-X264 compression, SA-PSNR and SA-SSIM have an increase of 2.864 and 0.008 respectively compared to traditional H.264, with higher ROI quality and the same compression ratio. Finally, a segmentation-based perception algorithm has been used to compare reconstructed frames, demonstrating a 2.7% mIOU improvement, when using the proposed SAC method versus traditional compression techniques. \u00c2\u00a9 2016 IEEE.",

      "abstract": "Technological advancements in Connected and Automated Vehicles (CAVs), particularly the integration of diverse stakeholder groups (communication service providers, road operators, automakers, repairers, CAV consumers, and the general public) and the pursuit of new economic opportunities, have resulted in the emergence of new technical, legal, and social challenges. The most pressing challenge is deterring criminal behaviour in both the physical and cyber realms through the adoption of CAV cybersecurity protocols and regulations. However, the literature lacks a systematic decision tool to analyze the impact of the potential cybersecurity regulations for dynamically interacting stakeholders, and to identify the leverage points to minimise the cyber-risks. To address this knowledge gap, this study uses systems theory to develop a dynamic modelling tool to analyze the indirect consequences of potential CAVs cybersecurity regulations in the medium to long term. It is hypothesized that CAVs Cybersecurity Regulatory Framework (CRF) is the property of the entire ITS stakeholders. The CRF is modelled using the System Dynamic based Stock-and-Flow-Model (SFM) technique. The SFM is founded on five critical pillars: the Cybersecurity Policy Stack, the Hacker's Capability, Logfiles, CAV Adopters, and intelligence-assisted traffic police. It is found that decision-makers should focus on three major leverage points: establishing a CRF grounded on automakers' innovation; sharing risks in eliminating negative externalities associated with underinvestment and knowledge asymmetries in cybersecurity; and capitalising on massive CAV-generated data in CAV operations. The formal integration of intelligence analysts and computer crime investigators to strengthen traffic police capabilities is pivotal. Recommendations for automakers include data-profiteering in CAV design, production, sales, marketing, safety enhancements and enabling consumer data transparency. Furthermore, CAVs-CRF necessitate a balanced approach to the trade-off between: i) data accessibility constraints on CAV automakers and ITS service providers; ii) regulator command and control thresholds; iii) automakers' business investment protection; and iv) consumers' data privacy guard. \u00c2\u00a9 2023 The Authors",

      "abstract": "The world we live in has been taken quite surprisingly by the outbreak of a novel virus namely SARS-CoV-2. COVID-19 i.e. the disease associated with the virus, has not only shaken the world economy due to enforced lockdown but has also saturated the public health care systems of even most advanced countries due to its exponential spread. The fight against COVID-19 pandemic will continue until majority of world\u2019s population get vaccinated or herd immunity is achieved. Many researchers have exploited the Artificial intelligence (AI) knacks based IoT architecture for early detection and monitoring of potential COVID-19 cases to control the transmission of the virus. However, the main cause of the spread is that people infected with COVID-19 do not show any symptoms and are asymptomatic but can still transmit virus to the masses. Researcher have introduced contact tracing applications to automatically detect contacts that can be infected by the index case. However, these fully automated contact tracing apps have not been accepted due to issues like privacy and cross-app compatibility. In the current study, an IoT based COVID-19 detection and monitoring system with semi-automated and improved contact tracing capability namely COVICT has been presented with application of real-time data of symptoms collected from individuals and contact tracing. The deployment of COVICT, the prediction of infected persons can be made more effective and contaminated areas can be identified to mitigate the further propagation of the virus by imposing Smart Lockdown. The proposed IoT based architecture can be quite helpful for regulatory authorities for policy making to fight COVID-19.",

      "abstract": "Predictable aggregations of large marine mammals are valuable conservation targets, but aggregated populations can also be exposed to site-level threats. The globally vulnerable Dugong dugon has a wide distribution but is found in large numbers mainly in Australia and the Arabian Gulf. Though Australian dugong populations are well studied, much less is known of the dugongs in the Arabian Gulf. The spatial and temporal persistence of dugongs around Bahrain, with a focus on large dugong groups (>50 dugongs), was determined using an occupancy modelling framework supported by historical records, structured interviews, citizen science network reports, and small-scale boat and unmanned aerial vehicle surveys. Historical records and current distributional studies confirmed that large dugong groups have been reliably sighted around Hawar Island (Bahrain) since at least 1986, forming large, clumped groups that persist almost year round. The largest recorded so far in the world, these fluid groups (maximum of ~700 dugongs) account for ~60% of the dugongs found in Bahrain and ~12% of all dugongs in the Arabian Gulf. The delineated occupancy core area of large dugong groups (~145\u00c2 km2) straddles the Bahrain\u00e2\u0080\u0093Qatar border, reflecting the transboundary nature of these groups. Careful management of human-induced stressors (in particular, fishing, boating, and coastal development) combined with regular monitoring of Hawar Island's large dugong groups and their seagrass habitat is critical to safeguard this globally important population. The effectiveness of any conservation management is predicated on strengthening cooperation among all range states in the Arabian Gulf. A key recommendation of this study is to establish a regional network of marine protected areas encompassing core aggregation sites for dugongs, particularly the Hawar Islands in Bahrain, the north-western waters of Qatar, Marawah Island in the United Arab Emirates in addition to the shallow waters between Saudi Arabia, Qatar, and United Arab Emirates. \u00c2\u00a9 2023 The Authors.

      "abstract": "This paper presents a finite-time visual servoing control strategy for the autonomous landing of a quadrotor onto a tilting and moving landing vehicle. The proposed method, called Finite-Time Dynamic Visual Servo (FTDVS) control, utilizes a computer vision technique called Virtual Reticle Image Plane (VRIP) to track four observable features on the landing plane called landmarks. To represent the sea state, target-plane tilting motion is modelled using monochromatic sinusoidal waves. VRIP exploits the sinusoidal tilting pose of the landing plane and calculates the time period of the tilting motion. Based on this time period, the proposed FTDVS control strategy enables the quadrotor to search for suitable landing windows on a tilting target plane. The proposed finite-time controller converges the tracking errors to zero in finite-time during a landing maneuver. First, a rigorous stability analysis of the FTDVS control law is presented, followed by simulations demonstrating acceptable performance in terms of tracking accuracy when compared to existing controllers for autonomous landing on moving targets. The proposed method has been experimentally validated in an indoor environment. \u00c2\u00a9 2004-2012 IEEE.",

      "abstract": "Multiple leader and follower graphical games constitute challenging problems for aerospace and robotics applications. One of the challenges is to address the mutual interests among the followers with an optimal control point of view. In particular, the traditional approaches treat the output containment problem by introducing selfish followers where each follower only considers their own utility. In this article, we propose a differential output containment game over directed graphs where the mutual interests among the followers are addressed with an objective functional that also considers the neighboring agents. The obtained output containment error system results in a formulation where outputs of all followers prove to converge to the convex hull spanned by the outputs of leaders in a game optimal manner. The output containment problem is solved using the H\u00e2\u0088\u009e output feedback method, where the new necessary and sufficient conditions are presented. Another challenge is to design distributed Nash equilibrium control strategies for such games, which cannot be achieved with the traditional quadratic cost functional formulation. Therefore, a modified cost functional that provides both Nash and distributed control strategies in the sense that each follower uses the state information of its own and neighbors is presented. Furthermore, an L2 gain bound of the output containment error system that experiences worst-case disturbances with respect to the H\u00e2\u0088\u009e criterion is investigated. The proposed methods are validated by means of multiagent quadrotor unmanned aerial vehicles output containment game simulations. \u00c2\u00a9 2014 IEEE.",

      "abstract": "Deep neural networks (DNNs) have been widely utilized in automatic visual navigation and recognition on modern unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), achieving state-of-the-art performances. However, DNN-based visual recognition systems on UAVs show serious vulnerability to adversarial camouflage patterns on targets and well-designed imperceptible perturbations in real-time images, which poses a threat to safety-related applications. Considering a scenario in which a UAV is suffering from adversarial attack, in this paper, we investigate and construct two ensemble approaches with CNN and transformer for both proactive (i.e., generate robust models) and reactive (i.e., adversarial detection) adversarial defense. They are expected to be secure under attack and adapt to the resource-limited environment on UAVs. Specifically, the probability distributions of output layers from base DNN models in the ensemble are combined in the proactive defense, which mainly exploits the weak adversarial transferability between the CNN and transformer. For the reactive defense, we integrate the scoring functions of several adversarial detectors with the hidden features and average the output confidence scores from ResNets and ViTs as a second integration. To verify their effectiveness in the recognition task of remote sensing images, we conduct experiments on both optical and synthetic aperture radar (SAR) datasets. We find that the ensemble model in proactive defense performs as well as three popular counterparts, and both of the ensemble approaches can achieve much more satisfactory results than a single base model/detector, which effectively alleviates adversarial vulnerability without extra re-training. In addition, we establish a one-stop platform for conveniently evaluating adversarial robustness and performing defense on recognition models called AREP-RSIs, which is beneficial for the future research of the remote sensing field.",

      "abstract": "Haze significantly impacts various fields, such as autonomous driving, smart cities, and security monitoring. Deep learning has been proven effective in removing haze from images. However, obtaining pixel-aligned hazy and clear paired images in the real world can be challenging. Therefore, synthesized hazed images are often used for training deep networks. These images are typically generated based on parameters such as depth information and atmospheric scattering coefficient. However, this approach may cause the loss of important haze details, leading to color distortion or incomplete dehazed images. To address this problem, this paper proposes a method for synthesizing hazed images using a cycle generative adversarial network (CycleGAN). The CycleGAN is trained with unpaired hazy and clear images to learn the features of the hazy images. Then, the real haze features are added to clear images using the trained CycleGAN, resulting in well-pixel-aligned synthesized hazy and clear paired images that can be used for dehaze training. The results demonstrate that the dataset synthesized using this method efficiently solves the problem associated with traditional synthesized datasets. Furthermore, the dehazed images are restored using a super-resolution algorithm, enabling the obtainment of high-resolution clear images. This method has broadened the applications of deep learning in haze removal, particularly highlighting its potential in the fields of autonomous driving and smart cities.",

      "abstract": "Asynchronous evolutionary algorithms are becoming increasingly popular as a means of making full use of many processors while solving computationally expensive search and optimization problems. These algorithms excel at keeping large clusters fully utilized, but may sometimes inefficiently sample an excess of fast-evaluating solutions at the expense of higher-quality, slow-evaluating ones. We have previously introduced a steady-state parent selection strategy, SWEET (\u00e2\u0080\u009cSelection whilE EvaluaTing\u00e2\u0080\u009d), that sometimes selects individuals that are still being evaluated and allows them to reproduce early. We perform a takeover-time analysis that confirms that this strategy gives slow-evaluating individuals that have higher fitnesses an increased ability to multiply in the population. We also find that SWEET appears effective at improving optimization performance on problems in which solution quality is positively correlated with evaluation time. We evaluate our approach on six simulated real-valued optimization problems and three real-world applications: an autonomous vehicle controller problem that involves tuning a spiking neural network and two adversarial EA problems. We further evaluate SWEET versus a basic asynchronous process in a simulated setting. We present evidence that SWEET outperforms basic asynchronous processes in a use-case in which performance is positively correlated with evaluation time, and performs comparably (and often better) than basic asynchronous processes in several use-cases where performance is negatively correlated with evaluation time. That said, in the cases where performance and evaluation time are negatively correlated the variance of outcomes for SWEET is notably high. \u00c2\u00a9 2022 The Authors.

Many modern techniques have been adopted to mitigate HECs, including remote sensing with unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs). Based on the UAV monitoring data of wild Asian elephants in China, we mapped the potential HEC hotspots and identified the possible related environmental factors. Our results indicated that there were six clusters of UAV-monitored elephant positions, and these corresponded to the previously known elephant subpopulations. According to the local Getis-Ord Gi* statistic, the potential HEC hotspots were mainly distributed around Mangao subreserve, Jingne Town, Mengman Town and near Mengwang Town. Physical barriers, including large rivers and highways, separated elephant position clusters and potential HEC hotspot areas. Generally, the potential HECs were near human settlements when the loss of human and elephant lives were emphasized more than the loss of economic plants. In addition, the potential HEC hotspots were distributed in regions with both lower slopes and lower river cover but higher food-rich covers. There have been few reports on HEC mapping based on UAV monitoring data, and our study may help widen and deepen the application of UAVs in mitigating HECs in China and elsewhere in the future. \u00c2\u00a9 2023 The Authors",

IoT-based communication infrastructure allows cyber-physical devices like electric cars to sense, monitor, and be controlled remotely. IoT cannot explore these uses due to cyberattacks on traditional communication infrastructure. This paper suggests an algorithm for monitoring and managing electric vehicles via the Internet of Things while preventing false data-injection attacks. First, a vision-equipped fully autonomous electric vehicle state-space model is described. Smart sensors and actuators in the Internet of Things infrastructure watch and adjust system states to compensate for the long distance between the electric vehicle and the control centre. Vehicle sensing data is sent to a central command centre via a vulnerable communication route. The mean square error principle yields the best state estimation method for visualising vehicle states. An optimal control algorithm manages car states using semi-definite programming. Simulations demonstrate how well the proposed algorithms can foresee and control vehicle states. \u00c2\u00a9 2023 Little Lion Scientific.",

      "abstract": "Operation accidents caused by deteriorated insulators occur from time to time, which poses a direct threat to the safe and stable operation of transmission lines. Much research has been done at home and abroad on the degradation mechanism of deteriorated insulators, the electric field distribution characteristics of insulator strings and the influence of deteriorated insulators on the space electric field, but there is little research on the influence of three-phase electrification on the space electric field of insulator strings. Therefore, this paper studies the simulation and detection of electric field distribution of deteriorated insulators in three-phase transmission lines. First, the difference between three-phase electrification and single-phase electrification on the space electric field of insulator strings is simulated and analyzed, and the influence of deteriorated insulators on the space electric field distribution of insulator strings under three-phase electrification is studied. Second, based on simulation results, a detection method for deteriorated insulators in three-phase overhead trans-mission lines is proposed, and a non-contact space electric field measurement device based on Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) is developed. Finally, a Unmanned Aerial Vehicle inspection system is used to test the transmission lines in combination with an electric power department, and the simulation results and the effectiveness of the proposed detection method are verified. Results show the electric field distribution of insulator strings is obviously different between three-phase electrification and single-phase electrification, and when the detection distance is 300 mm, the proposed detection method and device can effectively identify deteriorated insulators in three-phase transmission lines. \u00c2\u00a9 2023 - IOS Press.

With the collaborative task allocation of multiple UAVs as research objects, an online, safe, high-efficiency, and real-time task allocation method is designed. The contract network task allocation algorithm is described as a smart contract, and system consensus is reached based on the blockchain consensus algorithm. In addition, a simulation experiment system is built by using Hyperledger Fabric open source software, and simulation verification is carried out for a typical marine conventional submarine search and arrest application scenario.

      "abstract": "Autonomous Vehicles (AVs) using LiDAR-based object detection systems are rapidly improving and becoming an increasingly viable method of transportation. While effective at perceiving the surrounding environment, these detection systems are shown to be vulnerable to attacks using lasers which can cause obstacle misclassifications or removal. These laser attacks, however, are challenging to perform, requiring precise aiming and accuracy. Our research exposes a new threat in the form of Intentional Electro-Magnetic-Interference (IEMI), which affects the time-of-flight (TOF) circuits that make up modern LiDARs. We show that these vulnerabilities can be exploited to force the AV Perception system to misdetect, misclassify objects, and perceive non-existent obstacles. We evaluate the vulnerability in three AV perception modules (PointPillars, PointRCNN, and Apollo) and show how the classification rate drops below 50%. We also analyze the impact of the IEMI injection on two fusion models (AVOD and Frustum-ConvNet) and in real-world scenarios. Finally, we discuss potential countermeasures and propose two strategies to detect signal injection. \u00c2\u00a9 2023 ACM.",

Multi-view stereo photogrammetry (MVS-SfM) has emerged as a promising technique for acquiring high-resolution bathymetric data from aerial imagery. However, the accuracy of MVS-SfM can be affected by various factors, including water refraction, which can distort the depth measurements. In this study, iterative Dietrich\u2019s refraction-correction method is tested for extracting bathymetry from MVS-SfM in a complex riverine environment. Moreover, we proposed a workflow for applying the method using raster data files, which can be more readily available than point clouds. It also compared the obtained results with previous applications and evaluated them using statistical indices and ratios. For this case study, the multicamera refraction method produces bathymetric datasets with accuracies of ~0.019% of the flying height and precisions of ~0.07% of the flying height. This study contributes to increased confidence in exploiting aerial imagery for bathymetric mapping in photogrammetric procedures under field conditions and can facilitate the management and conservation of clear water systems.</p>",

The accuracy of direct georeferencing \u2013 the standard procedure in the field of outdoor mobile mapping \u2013 strongly relies on GNSS reception and therefore varies greatly depending on the environment. By incorporating control point observations, integrated georeferencing enables homogenous accuracy and reliability over the whole mapping perimeter. Unfortunately, exact measurement and documentation of control points is needed, which often must be done manually. To automate this process, approaches from the field of autonomous vehicles use pole-like objects to support localization in complex urban environments, with the disadvantage of requiring a prior mapping campaign. However, various classes of pole-like objects have been recorded with accurate location and entered in public cadastres, so they could serve as 2D control points. In this paper, we present an approach for improving the trajectory accuracy in challenging urban environments by means of integrated georeferencing. It uses range image observations to pole-like objects from publicly available cadastres. Our approach achieves sub-metre accuracy, with a maximal cross-track difference of 98 cm, using real-world data acquired with our low-cost mobile mapping system. We further demonstrate that it significantly improves discontinuities and inaccuracy peaks in direct georeferencing and that the limiting factors are errors in the depth estimation of available range imaging sensors.</p>",

The two platforms acquire from distant viewpoints and produce complementary point clouds, one describing predominantly horizontal surfaces and the other primarily vertical. Thus, the registration of the two data is not straightforward. This paper presents a test of targetless registration between a UAV LiDAR point cloud and terrestrial MMS surveys. The case study is a vegetated hilly landscape characterized by the presence of a structure of interest; the UAV acquisition allows the entire area to be acquired from above, while the terrestrial MMS acquisitions will enable the construction of interest to be detailed. The paper describes the survey phase with both techniques. It focuses on processing and registration strategies to fuse the two data together.</p><p>Our approach is based on the ICP (Iterative Closest Point) method by exploiting the data processing algorithms available in the Heron Desktop post-processing software for handling data acquired with the Heron Backpack MMS instrument. Two co-registration methods are compared. Both ways use the UAV point cloud as a reference and derive the registration of the terrestrial MMS data by finding ICP matches between the ground acquisition and the reference cloud exploiting only a few areas of overlap. The two methods are detailed in the paper, and both allow us to complete the co-registration task.</p>",

      "abstract": "A fluorometric graphene oxide (GO)-based assay was used to determine agrB gene transcription in methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA). This method is based on exonuclease III (Exo III)-assisted target recycling and hybridization chain reaction (HCR). A hairpin DNA probe (HP1) was designed to contain a capture probe (CP) and trigger probe (TP). Without a target, all of the carboxy-fluorescein (FAM)-labeled hairpins (HP2 and HP3) were adsorbed onto the surface of GO by \u00cf\u0080-stacking interactions, leading to the quenching of the dye. Upon addition of the target RNA, the 3\u00e2\u0080\u00b2-strand of HP1 was cleaved stepwise by Exo III, accompanied by the release of the target RNA and autonomous generation of a new TP. The released target RNA hybridized to another HP1 and entered the next round of the reaction. TP initiated HCR with the assistance of HP2 and HP3 to generate a long double-stranded DNA (dsDNA) product. GO did not absorb the dsDNA product and produced strong fluorescence. Therefore, the target RNA was quantified by measuring the fluorescence at excitation and emission wavelengths of 480/514 nm. More importantly, fluorescence was greatly enhanced by exploiting the synergistic effect of FAM and the dsDNA-SYBR Green I (SGI) duplex structure. This bioassay exhibited good selectivity and high sensitivity with a linear response in the 10 fM and 1 nM target RNA concentration range and a 5.8 fM limit of detection (LOD). It was successfully used to monitor biofilm formation and to study the mechanism of drug action with satisfactory results. \u00c2\u00a9 2023 The Royal Society of Chemistry.",

To mitigate this risk, monitoring and early warning systems are essential. However, monitoring high-angle landslide areas can be challenging due to the steep and complex terrain, making it difficult to carry out large-scale and refined deformation measurements using existing methods. This paper proposes a method to measure the large-scale deformation of landslide bodies based on nap-of-the-object photogrammetry. The method uses UAVs to acquire high-resolution 3D models of steep and high landslide areas at multiple time periods. Then, 3D model matching is employed to obtain accurate variation information for terrain deformation measurement. To obtain fine 3D models, a terrain-adaptive nap-of-the-object photogrammetric flight planning is applied to design the optimal photographic positions and directions for capturing ultra-high-resolution images. The images are processed using photogrammetric principles and technologies to produce fine 3D models. For terrain deformation measurement, an algorithm is proposed to obtain 3D correspondences by fusing DEM differential and 3D model texture matching. The 3D points variation vectors are then calculated, and the large-scale deformation measurement results of the landslide body can be derived after the vectors are aggregated. Experiments were conducted on the Lijiebeishan landslide in Gansu Province, western China. The results showed that the proposed deformation measurement method was highly effective in accurately detecting areas with displacement greater than 5 cm, and the large-scale deformation trend is consistent with GNSS predictions. In conclusion, the proposed method is an effective way to measure the large-scale deformation of landslide bodies in high-angle landslide areas, providing a valuable tool for monitoring and early warning systems.</p>",

      "abstract": "The ability of the Hybrid VTOL UAV to operate for both hovering and level flight makes it highly appealing. A transitional flight is one in which both the rotors and the forward propeller are active and the interaction between the rotors and the main wing takes place. This phenomenon, which influences the lift produced by the primary wing, is not entirely understood. This paper studies the interaction between the propellers and the main wing during straight and level flight conditions and how it affects lift generation. The vertical motors were modelled as actuator disks (AD) to represent the spinning rotors. The wing is designed by careful physical characteristics comparison, selection, and performing CFD analysis of aerofoil DEA-31, at low Reynolds number, i.e., Re = 2 \u00c3\u0097 105 with varying angle of attack, i.e., \u00ce\u00b1 = - 4\u00c2\u00b0 to 20\u00c2\u00b0 with an interval of 2\u00c2\u00b0 to obtain maximum lift generated by the wing. The CFD analysis is performed in ANSYS Fluent and the stability analysis in XFLR5. It has been found that the FWD rotor impacts the oncoming air, causing rotor wash on the wing, which reduces momentum on the bottom of the wing, reducing the lift produced by the wing. The AFT rotor, on the other hand, increases the momentum of the airflow over the upper surface of the wing, decreasing the pressure and enhancing the wing's overall lift. Thus, it is suggested that the AFT rotor be located towards the trailing edge and that the throttle be adjusted somewhat higher to enhance the lift generated by the wing. \u00c2\u00a9 2023 Author(s).",

In particular, military technologies of artificial intelligence and robotics, increasing the potential of weapons, create a large number of new risks and threats to humans. In the article, the authors, using methods of comparative legal, historical and legal and systemic legal analysis, considered the problems associated with the modern development of autonomous weapons systems based on artificial intelligence and machine learning applications, their potential impact on ensuring military security and legal protection of civilian infrastructure in accordance with international humanitarian law. The authors justify the conclusion that despite the fact that an autonomous system or function is to some extent outside the control of a person, nevertheless, a person exercises control at the stage of its design and development, at the time of activation for a specific task and during work. The results obtained allowed the authors to formulate conclusions that autonomous systems have a potentially high level of risk of violation of the rule of law in relation to civil infrastructure facilities and, taking into account the specifics, trends and rates of their development, determine the creation of effective legal mechanisms for their protection in an armed conflict. \u00c2\u00a9 2023 Author(s).",

      "abstract": "Nowadays, unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs)-assisted mobile-edge computing (MEC) systems have been exploited as a promising solution for providing computation services to mobile users outside of terrestrial networks. However, it remains challenging for standalone UAVs to meet the computation requirement of numerous users due to their limited computation capacity and battery lives. Therefore, we propose a collaborative scheme among UAVs to share the workload between them. Furthermore, this work is the first to consider the task topology of offloading in MEC-enabled UAVs networks while restricting their power consumption. We study the task topology, in which a task consists of a set of subtasks, and each subtask has dependencies upon other subtasks. In the real world, subtasks with dependencies must wait for their preceding subtasks to complete before being executed, and this affects the offloading strategy. Next, we formulate an optimization problem to minimize the average latency of users by jointly controlling the offloading decision for dependent tasks and allocating the communication resources of UAVs. The formulated problem is NP-hard and cannot be solved in polynomial time. Therefore, we divide the problem into two subproblems: 1) offloading decision problem and 2) communication resource allocation problem. Then, a metaheuristic method is proposed to find the suboptimal solution to the former problem, while the latter problem is solved by using convex optimization. Finally, we conduct simulation experiments to prove that our proposed offloading technique outperforms several benchmark schemes in minimizing the average latency of users for dependency tasks and achieving higher uplink transmission rates. \u00c2\u00a9 2014 IEEE.",

The proposed system performs spatial filtering of multipath coming from other directions than the direct satellite signals. For satellite direction estimation satellite ephemeris data is used. Several scenarios with different degree of multipath are studied. The use of beamforming increases receiver's carrier-to-noise ratio up to about 8 dB and allows visibility of more GNSS satellites.

Robotics provides a secure solution to the issue but still encounters challenges in uncertain environments. Rapidly inferring source parameters is a prerequisite for unmanned source search. However, when the number of sources exceeds one, the sensor can only measure the intensity of the coupled field. We propose a novel online multi-radiation source term estimation framework for autonomous source-searching tasks. The method incrementally constructs the state space of Bayesian estimation to adapt to diverse scenarios. Inspired by multi-sensor fusion and particle filtering, this framework employs multi-layer particles and updates them simultaneously to enhance the efficiency of fitting observations. Subsequently, the approach corrects (eliminate and randomly generate) the particles based on Poisson kriging interpolation to prevent particles in redundant layers from interfering with estimation. Furthermore, we compare the performances of our proposed algorithm with those in simulated and real experiments. Various metrics demonstrate that the suggested framework is accurate and robust. \u00c2\u00a9 2023 Elsevier Ltd",

Under this common CPS architecture, we develop tools that can identify vulnerabilities in the system and their impact on the functionality of the CPS. We pose the CPS security problem as a falsification (or Search Based Test Generation (SBTG)) problem guided by security requirements expressed in Signal Temporal Logic (STL). We propose two different categories of security requirements encoded in STL: (1) detectability (stealthiness) and (2) effectiveness (impact on the CPS function). Finally, we demonstrate in simulation on an inverted pendulum and on an Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) that both specifications are falsifiable using our SBTG techniques. \u00c2\u00a9 2023 Copyright held by the owner/author(s).

      "abstract": "Programmable Logic Controllers (PLCs) are the backbone of modern-day Industrial Control Systems (ICSs), and as such play a key role in many critical infrastructure sectors (e.g., water and water-waste management, power distribution, transportation, food and agriculture, critical manufacturing, etc.). Given the important functions that PLCs carry out within many critical infrastructures, a cyber-compromise of even a single PLC device can have far-reaching impact and consequences, ranging from distribution-system outages, environmental pollution, mass water and food poisoning, to outright loss of human life. The objective of this work-in-progress is to develop a free open source tool, named PIRAT, for cyber-risk assessment of individual PLC components, as well as more complex PLC systems. The tool synthesizes the user-provided PLC component/system information with the readily available data from the National Vulnerability Database (NVD) and MITRE Adversarial Tactics, Techniques and Common Knowledge (MITRE ATT&CK) database. The output of the tool is an aggregate risk scores for the given PLC component/system. The risk score is derived not only based on the known PLC vulnerabilities, but also based on the presence and capabilities of advance persistent threat (APT) groups potentially targeting the given PLC component/system and/or targeting the respective critical infrastructure industry. \u00c2\u00a9 ICCPS 2023.

      "abstract": "Cyber-physical systems (CPSs) are complex systems comprised of computational processes, communication networks, and elements interacting with the physical world. The design of the CPSs involves many domain-specific tools and design flows created by engineers with diverse domain knowledge. As the scale of the systems increases, the heterogeneity nature of CPS design prolongs the CPS design process, making exhaustive design-space exploration infeasible. The symbiotic design methodology, in which the designers interact with optimization tools during the design process, is therefore promising to facilitate the design process by performing design exploration in a properly restricted design space. We present a symbiotic design methodology, which explores the design space iteratively and optimizes the system by exploiting the collaboration between designers and tools. The optimization tools perform the design space exploration, while the human designers use their expertise to guide the exploration by restricting the design space. Experimental results based on a robot car configuration problem and an unmanned aerial vehicle design problem show that the methodology can efficiently and effectively discover unconventional designs while optimizing the design objectives. \u00c2\u00a9 2023 Owner/Author.",

      "abstract": "Learning Enabled Components (LEC) have greatly assisted cyber-physical systems in achieving higher levels of autonomy. However, LEC\u00e2\u0080\u0099s susceptibility to dynamic and uncertain operating conditions is a critical challenge for the safety of these systems. Redundant controller architectures have been widely adopted for safety assurance in such contexts. These architectures augment LEC \u00e2\u0080\u009cperformant\u00e2\u0080\u009d controllers that are difficult to verify with \u00e2\u0080\u009csafety\u00e2\u0080\u009d controllers and the decision logic to switch between them. While these architectures ensure safety, we point out two limitations. First, they are trained offline to learn a conservative policy of always selecting a controller that maintains the system\u00e2\u0080\u0099s safety, which limits the system\u00e2\u0080\u0099s adaptability to dynamic and non-stationary environments. Second, they do not support reverse switching from the safety controller to the performant controller, even when the threat to safety is no longer present. To address these limitations, we propose a dynamic simplex strategy with an online controller switching logic that allows two-way switching. We consider switching as a sequential decision-making problem and model it as a semi-Markov decision process. We leverage a combination of a myopic selector using surrogate models (for the forward switch) and a non-myopic planner (for the reverse switch) to balance safety and performance. We evaluate this approach using an autonomous vehicle case study in the CARLA simulator using different driving conditions, locations, and component failures. We show that the proposed approach results in fewer collisions and higher performance than state-of-the-art alternatives. \u00c2\u00a9 ICCPS 2023. All rights reserved.",

Given a precondition and postcondition of a system, we formalize two quantitative safety notions, quantitative forward and backward safety, which respectively express (1) how strong the strongest postcondition of the system is with respect to the specified postcondition, and (2) how strong the specified precondition is with respect to the weakest precondition of the system needed to ensure the specified postcondition holds. We introduce two notions, forward and backward robustness, to characterize the robustness of a system against sensor attacks as the loss of safety. Two simulation distances, which respectively characterize upper bounds of the degree of forward and backward safety loss caused by the sensor attacks, are developed to reason with robustness. We verify the two simulation distances by expressing them as formulas of differential dynamic logic.

      "abstract": "The present paper aims to design and simulate an adversarial strategy where a swarm of quadrotor UAVs is herding anti-aircraft land vehicles (AALV) that actively oppose the swarm\u2019s objective by potentially taking them down. The main strategy is to block the AALVs\u2019 line of sight to their goal zone (AALVs\u2019 objective), shifting its trajectory so it reaches a kill zone instead (UAVs\u2019 objective). The counter-swarm strategy performed by the AALVs consists of taking down the closest aerial units to the goal zone. As a result, a consensus algorithm is executed by the UAVs in order to assess the communication network and re-group. Consensus is based on the propagation of local observations that converge into a global agreement on a communication graph. Re-grouping is done via positioning around the kill zone vector or preferring an anti-clockwise formation to better close gaps. The adversarial strategy was tested in an empty arena and urban setting, the latter making use of a path-planning procedure that re-routes the AALV trajectory based on its current destination. Simulation results show a maximum UAV mission success rate converging to roughly 80% in the empty arena. When targeted elimination procedures are executed, UAV mission performance drops 5%, making no distinction between re-grouping strategies in the empty arena. The urban setting shows lower performance due to navigation complexity but favors the decision to re-group based on a formation that close gaps rather than positioning around the kill zone vector.",

The IoMT sensors communicate medical data to server for the quick diagnosis. As, it handles private and confidential information of a user, security is the primary objective. The existing IoT authentication schemes either using two-factor(Username, password) or multi-factor (username, password, biometric) to authenticate a user. Typically the structural characteristics-based biometric trait like Face, Iris, Palm print or finger print is used as a additional factor. There are chances that these biometrics can be fabricated. Thus, these structural biometrics based authentication schemes are fail to provide privacy, security, authenticity, and integrity. The biodynamic-based bioacoustics signals are gained attention in the era of human-computer interactions to authenticate a user as it is a unique feature to each user. So, we use a frequency domain based bio-acoustics as a biometric input. Thus, this work propose a Secure Lightweight Bioacoustics based User Authentication Scheme using fuzzy embedder for the Internet of Medical Things applications. Also, the IoT sensors tends to join and leave the network dynamically, the proposed scheme adopts chinese remainder technique for generate a group secret key to protect the network from the attacks of former sensor nodes. The proposed scheme's security is validated using the formal verification tool AVISPA(Automated Validation of Internet Security Protocols and Applications). The system's performance is measured by comparing the proposed scheme to existing systems in terms of security features, computation and communication costs. It demonstrates that the proposed system outperforms existing systems. \u00c2\u00a9 2023 - IOS Press. All rights reserved.",

      "abstract": "Particle swarm optimization (PSO) algorithm has a potential to solve route planning problem for unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV). However, the traditional PSO algorithm is easy to fall into local optimum under the complicated environments with multiple threats. In order to improve the performance in different complicated environments, a novel and effective PSO algorithm with adaptive adjustment of the parameters, cylinder vector and different evolution operator, named ACVDEPSO, is proposed and demonstrated to be effective for route planning problem for UAV. In the proposed ACVDEPSO, the velocity of the particle is converted to its cylinder vector for the convenience of the path search. It is worth highlighting that the parameters of ACVDEPSO algorithm are automatically chosen by the time and the fitness values of the particles. Furthermore, a challenger based on differential evolution operator is introduced to reduce the probability of falling into local optimum and accelerate the algorithm convergence speed. The simulation experiments have been conducted in real digital elevation model (DEM) maps to test the performance of the ACVDEPSO. The experiment results validate that the optimization performance of the ACVDEPSO outperforms the other comparison methods, which can efficiently generate a higher quality path for UAV under the complicated 3D environments. \u00c2\u00a9 2023",

      "abstract": "This paper investigates the issue of searching and geolocating a radio frequency (RF) emitter with an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) in a rich scattering environment. The absence of knowledge of the characteristics of the target RF signals, the ground-to-air channels, and the potential geographical distribution of the RF emitter makes efficient trajectory planning (TP) and geolocating intractable. Since the average signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of the signal captured by the UAV changes across the search area, state-of-the-art TP is inapplicable due to the assumption of a single problem domain, according to the No Free Lunch (NFL) theorem. In contrast, we develop a cognitive multi-stage search and geolocation (CMSG) framework, which adjusts the adopted TP algorithms in various search stages. In the stage with extremely-low SNRs, a random-walk-based TP is proposed to avoid meaningless detours. For stages with higher SNRs, the TP follows policies optimized by a novel search method based on direction of arrival (DOA) estimation and reinforcement learning. To alleviate the impairment of unreliable DOA estimations, empirical emitter position estimations are exploited to find the best flight directions. Simulation results confirm the advantages of the proposed CMSG over various baselines in lowering both failure rate and time consumption. \u00c2\u00a9 1967-2012 IEEE.",

      "abstract": "The fifth-generation (5G) based vehicle-to-everything (V2X) communication is a promising technology to enhance both manned and unmanned driving systems. To this end, the 5G V2X networks should satisfy stringent requirements on transmission reliability and delay for exchanging safety-critical messages (SCMs). A joint analysis of transmission reliability and delay in V2X communication networks is thus crucial, particularly in urban 5G V2X networks. This was considered prohibitive due to the complicated spatial-temporal dynamics of V2X communications caused by interference, channel fading, as well as queueing and retransmission of SCMs. Moreover, urban 5G V2X networks are typically deployed in a finite area, where locations of nodes are spatially correlated and cannot be conveniently modeled as Poisson point process (PPP). In this paper, we propose a novel binomial point process (BPP) based analytic framework for modeling the spatial-temporal dynamics of urban 5G V2X communications and characterizing transmission reliability and delay of SCM exchange jointly. The presented framework captures not only the spatial distribution of interference and channel fading during uplink and downlink transmissions, but also the temporal dynamics associated with queueing and retransmissions of SCMs. Exploiting the stochastic geometry theory and queueing theory, closed-form expressions of transmission reliability and delay are derived, which are further validated using Monte Carlo simulations. Both the numerical and simulation results reveal complicated couplings between the transmission reliability and delay in different operation regimes. Nevertheless, the proposed analytical framework can accurately capture the reliability-delay relations. \u00c2\u00a9 2013 IEEE.",

      "abstract": "Without the involvements of human beings, cyber physical systems (CPSs) run based on many devices distributed everywhere around the smart city. Autonomous vehicles (AVs) occupy a critical part in modern transportation systems under the condition of 5G wireless communication. To help people make decisions, AVs collect and produce instant information on the roads. When messages are trasferred from AVs, real-time and dependable authentications are required. Recently, a host of signature or key agreement authentication schemes have been proposed by researchers. However, weaknesses appear, such as instant data sent from autonomous vehicles are in plaintext, and attackers can track the identity of the autonomous vehicle even if pseudo-identity mechanism is employed. In this paper, we introduce a new authentication scheme for AVs in transportation systems. Formal proof with random oracles demonstrates that it is difficult for the adversary to forge the four messages in the public communication environment. Moreover, security properties including vehicle anonymity, traceability and mutual authentication meet the requirements in our discussion. At last, the performation test with miracl library and simulation with NS3 show that the proposed scheme is practical due to completeness of more security targets than others. \u00c2\u00a9 2023 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.",

      "abstract": "Deep learning-based models have achieved significant success in detecting cardiac arrhythmia by analyzing ECG signals to categorize patient heartbeats. To improve the performance of such models, we have developed a novel hybrid hierarchical attention-based bidirectional recurrent neural network with dilated CNN (HARDC) method for arrhythmia classification. This solves problems that arise when traditional dilated convolutional neural network (CNN) models disregard the correlation between contexts and gradient dispersion. The proposed HARDC fully exploits the dilated CNN and bidirectional recurrent neural network unit (BiGRU\u00e2\u0080\u0093BiLSTM) architecture to generate fusion features. As a result of incorporating both local and global feature information and an attention mechanism, the model's performance for prediction is improved. By combining the fusion features with a dilated CNN and a hierarchical attention mechanism, the trained HARDC model showed significantly improved classification results and interpretability of feature extraction on the PhysioNet 2017 challenge dataset. Sequential Z-Score normalization, filtering, denoising, and segmentation are used to prepare the raw data for analysis. CGAN (Conditional Generative Adversarial Network) is then used to generate synthetic signals from the processed data. The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed HARDC model significantly outperforms other existing models, achieving an accuracy of 99.60%, F1 score of 98.21%, a precision of 97.66%, and recall of 99.60% using MIT-BIH generated ECG. In addition, this approach significantly reduces run time when using dilated CNN compared to normal convolution. Overall, this hybrid model demonstrates an innovative and cost-effective strategy for ECG signal compression and high-performance ECG recognition. Our results indicate that an automated and highly computed method to classify multiple types of arrhythmia signals holds considerable promise. \u00c2\u00a9 2023 Elsevier Ltd",

      "abstract": "African swine fever (ASF) causes fatal disease in pigs and is an escalating threat to the global swine industry. ASF has re-emerged from Africa as a transcontinental epidemic spreading through the Caucasus into Europe, Russia, China, numerous Asian countries, and the Caribbean. ASF virus (ASFV) is a U.S. select agent requiring handling in high-containment biosafety level 3 (BSL-3) laboratories for pathogen work. Formalin-fixation eliminates infectivity and preserves the genome, providing noninfectious specimens for BSL-2 work. Recovery of DNA from formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded tissue (FFPET) is challenging and cumbersome. A reliable and easy-to-perform method for DNA recovery from FFPET would facilitate surveillance. To meet this objective, we developed a high-throughput protocol for the recovery of ASFV DNA from FFPET. Deparaffinization, tissue lysis, and reversal of cross-linking were performed in a single tube, followed by DNA purification via automated magnetic bead extraction. Quantitative PCR (qPCR) detection was used to determine the copy number of the B646L gene that encodes for the ASFV p72 protein in tissues (5 pigs, 4 tissues) from pigs with lesions consistent with acute ASF. Copy numbers obtained from FFPET were within one log of copy numbers obtained from fresh tissue, thus enabling ASF qPCR surveillance from formalin-inactivated and preserved tissues at BSL-2 at diagnostic sensitivity similar to fresh tissues tested at BSL-3. \u00c2\u00a9 2023 The Author(s).",

To access them, we propose an iterative physical acoustics (IPA)-based method to simulate the multiple acoustic scattered fields on rigid surfaces in high-frequency cases. It uses the Helmholtz integral equation with an appropriate Green's function in terms of the Neumann series, and then incorporates the ideas of triangulation and iteration into a numerical implementation. Then two approximate analytic formulae with precise physical meanings are derived to predict the TS and CSAS images of concave targets, respectively. There are no restrictions on the surface's curvature and the order of multiple scattering. The method is validated against the finite element method (FEM) for acoustic scattering from a sphere segment and against an experiment involving an X-rudder UUV's stern. On this basis, we simulate and analyze the TS and CSAS images of an X-rudder UUV. In addition, the influence of the angle of adjacent rudders on the multiple scattering characteristics is discussed. Results show that this method can potentially predict accurate UUV features, especially the multiple scattered features. \u00c2\u00a9 2023 China Ordnance Society",

      "abstract": "Purpose: Gross tumor volume (GTV) delineation for head and neck cancer (HNC) radiation therapy planning is time consuming and prone to interobserver variability (IOV). The aim of this study was (1) to develop an automated GTV delineation approach of primary tumor (GTVp) and pathologic lymph nodes (GTVn) based on a 3D convolutional neural network (CNN) exploiting multi-modality imaging input as required in clinical practice, and (2) to validate its accuracy, efficiency and IOV compared to manual delineation in a clinical setting. Methods: Two datasets were retrospectively collected from 150 clinical cases. CNNs were trained for GTV delineation with consensus delineation as ground truth, with either single (CT) or co-registered multi-modal (CT + PET or CT + MRI) imaging data as input. For validation, GTVs were delineated on 20 new cases by two observers, once manually, once by correcting the delineations generated by the CNN. Results: Both multi-modality CNNs performed better than the single-modality CNN and were selected for clinical validation. Mean Dice Similarity Coefficient (DSC) for (GTVp, GTVn) respectively between automated and manual delineations was (69%, 79%) for CT + PET and (59%,71%) for CT + MRI. Mean DSC between automated and corrected delineations was (81%,89%) for CT + PET and (69%,77%) for CT + MRI. Mean DSC between observers was (76%,86%) for manual delineations and (95%,96%) for corrected delineations, indicating a significant decrease in IOV (p < 10\u00e2\u0088\u00925), while efficiency increased significantly (48%, p < 10\u00e2\u0088\u00925). Conclusion: Multi-modality automated delineation of GTV of HNC was shown to be more efficient and consistent compared to manual delineation in a clinical setting and beneficial over a single-modality approach. \u00c2\u00a9 2023 The Author(s)",

      "abstract": "In hemoglobinopathy-prone regions, like the Middle East, thalassemia is the most prevalent noncommunicable life-threatening disorder of children and is highly curable by hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT). Moreover, transplantation is very cost-effective, and HSCT programs can be established directly in middle-income countries (MICs) at a reduced cost while maintaining quality standards and outcomes consistent with international ones. The aim of the present study was to review and verify the efficacy of the applied methodology through the analysis of 47 consecutive matched-related HSCTs in children with thalassemia. In 2016, the first HSCT unit for adults and children with both malignant and nonmalignant diseases was developed in Iraqi Kurdistan, thanks to a capacity building project funded by the Italian Agency for Development Cooperation. Data on clinical activity were obtained from a cohort of patients treated in the newly established HSCT unit. Primary endpoints were overall survival (OS) and thalassemia-free survival (TFS). Startup of the HSCT unit was completed over a 3-year period. Assessing and meeting minimum requirements were crucial for the startup; moreover, a team of international health care professionals (HCPs), all experts in the field of HSCT, conducted the education and training phase, involving all the clinical and nonclinical professionals in the program. At a median follow-up of 2.6 years, the 3-year TFS and OS were 82.8% (SE, 5.5%) and 87.1% (SE, 4.9%), respectively. TFS and graft-versus-host-disease-free composite survival was 80.6% (SE, 5.8%). At present, the HSCT service is completely autonomous, and more than 250 transplants have been done in both adults and children. The minimal essential requirements for an HSCT startup may be affordable in many MICs. Our results for thalassemia are comparable with international data. A twinning program with an international group of experts and a capacity-building approach is crucial for the success of the program, a strategy that allows for rapid development of HSCT units. \u00c2\u00a9 2023 The American Society for Transplantation and Cellular Therapy",

      "abstract": "To cope with the negative impacts of climate change and human activities on water resources in basins, positive measures such as interbasin water transfer projects and efficient water resource policies have been implemented worldwide, and these measures have had an obvious effect on the discharges of large rivers. However, for small and medium-sized rivers, the impact is still unclear due to a deficiency in river discharge data. To answer this question, the Haihe River Basin (HRB), located in the core area of economic development in North China, was selected as a typical research area. Remote sensing hydrological station technology, which combines unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), satellite remote sensing, and in situ surveying, was applied to obtain the monthly scale discharges of 16 small and medium-sized river sections in the last 20 years (2000\u00e2\u0080\u00932020). In addition, an accuracy evaluation and spatiotemporal change analysis of the discharge results, which were influenced by interbasin water transfer projects and efficient water resource management policies, were also carried out. The results show that 1) 10 of the 16 river sections in the basin had a downward trend in the past 20 years, with an average annual decrease of 2.13%, and these sections were located in the plain areas; the remaining 6 sections located in the mountain areas had an upward trend, with an average annual increase of 1.72%; 2) we found that the river discharges of small and medium-sized rivers recovered with a lag that reached 3\u00e2\u0080\u009311 years for the 16 rivers, and this lag for the mountain rivers was 3\u00e2\u0080\u00939 years and for the plain rivers, it was 8\u00e2\u0080\u009311 years; and 3) the main cause of this lag was the heavy exploitation of groundwater in the basin, which led to increased water volume from interbasin water transfers mainly to supplement groundwater resources, while surface water resources could not be quickly and sufficiently supplemented to restore them to the original natural discharge. Our research not only unmasks the changes of small and medium-sized river discharge in areas strongly affected by human activities but also helps people to better understand the response of small and medium-sized river discharges to the complex environmental changes incurred by climate change and serious human activities. \u00c2\u00a9 2023 Elsevier B.V.",

      "abstract": "Intelligent transportation systems are an emerging technology that facilitates real-time vehicle-to-everything communication. Hence, securing and authenticating data packets for intra- and inter-vehicle communication are fundamental security services in vehicular ad-hoc networks (VANETs). However, public-key cryptography (PKC) is commonly used in signature-based authentication, which consumes significant computation resources and communication bandwidth for signatures generation and verification, and key distribution. Therefore, physical layer-based secret key extraction has emerged as an effective candidate for key agreement, exploiting the randomness and reciprocity features of wireless channels. However, the imperfect channel reciprocity generates discrepancies in the extracted key, and existing reconciliation algorithms suffer from significant communication costs and security issues. In this paper, PKC-based authentication is used for initial legitimacy detection and exchanging authenticated probing packets. Accordingly, we propose a blockchain-based reconciliation technique that allows the trusted third party (TTP) to publish the correction sequence of the mismatched bits through a transaction using a smart contract. The smart contract functions enable the TTP to map the transaction address to vehicle-related information and allow vehicles to obtain the transaction contents securely. The obtained shared key is then used for symmetric key cryptography (SKC)-based authentication for subsequent transmissions, saving significant computation and communication costs. The correctness and security robustness of the scheme are proved using Burrows\u00e2\u0080\u0093Abadi\u00e2\u0080\u0093Needham (BAN)-logic and Automated Validation of Internet Security Protocols and Applications (AVISPA) simulator. We also discussed the scheme's resistance to typical attacks. The scheme's performance in terms of packet delay and loss ratio is evaluated using the network simulator (OMNeT++). Finally, the computation analysis shows that the scheme saves \u00e2\u0088\u00bc99% of the time required to verify 1000 messages compared to existing PKC-based schemes. \u00c2\u00a9 2023 The Author(s)",

      "abstract": "Air pollution is one of the major health hazards in modern times. Vehicle pollution is one of the major contributors to aerial contamination. Significant emphasis has been given by the researchers to identify the traffic pollutant sources. However, there is a need for a low-cost, automated solution for fast detection of polluting vehicles from the end of law enforcers. In this article, we have presented a novel deep learning based evaluation strategy that will identify the pollutant vehicle through on- road installed surveillance camera images. An enhanced image data set with notable variations has been prepared for training the models. Thereafter, a multi-model feedback process has been integrated. In contrast to the other deep learning approaches, the proposed framework has started with low labeled training data which is quite relevant in real-life scenarios. Subsequently, the size of the training samples has been increased using feedback. The evaluation of the framework has been performed with seven popular deep learning CNN models, i.e Inception-V3, MobileNet-V2, MobileNet-V3 (small), InceptionResNet-V2, VGG16, VGG19 and XceptionNet. Transfer learning has been exploited to distinguish the on- road pollutants and to provide proper surveillance in transport system. We have compared our method with recent state-of-the-art techniques. The results have demonstrated the superiority of the proposed framework in the road surveillance domain. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first attempt to apply a feedback based iterative deep learning model for vehicle pollution detection. \u00c2\u00a9 2000-2011 IEEE.",

      "abstract": "Internet of Vehicles (IoVs) consists of smart vehicles, Autonomous Vehicles (AVs) as well as roadside units (RSUs) that communicate wirelessly to provide enhanced transportation services such as improved traffic efficiency and reduced traffic congestion and accidents. Unfortunately, current IoV networks suffer from security, privacy, and trust issues. Blockchain technology emerged as a decentralized approach for enhanced security without depending on trusted third parties to run services. Blockchain offers the benefits of trustworthiness and immutability and mitigates the problem of a single point of failure and other attacks. In this work, we present the state-of-the-art Blockchain-enabled IoVs (BIoVs) with a particular focus on their applications, such as crowdsourcing-based applications, energy trading, traffic congestion reduction, collision, accident avoidance, infotainment, and content caching. We also present in-depth applications of federated learning (FL) for BIoVs. The key challenges of integrating Blockchain with IoV are investigated in several domains, such as edge computing, machine learning, and Federated Learning (FL). Lastly, we present several open issues, challenges, and future opportunities in AI-enabled BIoV, hardware-assisted security for BIoV, and quantum computing attacks on BIoV applications. \u00c2\u00a9 2023 Elsevier Inc.",

      "abstract": "The universalization of electricity still presents significant obstacles to achieving the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals. There are still many remote areas, such as oceanic islands and isolated communities disconnected from the grid, that depend on fossil fuels to make it viable. Fernando de Noronha, a tropical oceanic island in Brazil, is a typical case where replacing the diesel-based power plant for renewable energy is imperative, therefore, it served as a testbed for this investigation. This paper presents the implementation and results of a low-cost framework for assessing the photovoltaic potential of rooftops. Using a real case study, the objective is to explore how effective rooftop photovoltaic systems could be on Fernando de Noronha Island by applying low-cost aerophotogrammetry, geospatial analysis and scenario creation. The first approach was mapping buildings, open spaces and solar obstacles using unmanned aerial photogrammetric survey that delivered high-quality digital elevation surface. The 3D rooftop surfaces fed the solar irradiation models and enabled to compute the photovoltaic potential of suitable rooftops. Findings show that 83.3% of the total building rooftop area was deemed economically viable for photovoltaic installations. Furthermore, 80.0% and 60.0% of the rooftops receive annual irradiation levels >1600 kWh/m2 and 2000 kWh/m2, respectively, indicating high potential for exploiting solar resources on decentralized, highly irradiated rooftops. The scenario with the highest photovoltaic potential is three times higher than the lowest. The results indicate that the suitability of rooftops for various photovoltaic system sizes offers the possibility of deploying a combination of smaller and larger urban photovoltaic installations. Furthermore, the decentralized photovoltaic rooftops can compensate for between 66 and 199% of the estimated annual consumption of 31 GWh in 2031. The method is highly transferrable and limited solely by the availability of sources of geospatial data and coordination with stakeholders. The investigation meets the needs of the Brazilian Ministry of Mines and Energy, therefore meeting the environmental needs of the energy sector by promoting renewable energy for the island which is a UNESCO Natural World Heritage Site and Brazilian National Marine Park and Environmental Protected Area. The investigation demonstrated that creating photovoltaic potential scenarios that nurture informed decision-making processes is a crucial initial step in urban renewable energy planning. The pioneering 2000-ha unmanned aerial photogrammetric survey proved to be a cost-efficient method for producing accurate data for modeling the irradiation and photovoltaic potential in urban areas. The investigation fills the literature gap on modeling photovoltaic potential for remote islands by blending unmanned aerial vehicles and geospatial tools. \u00c2\u00a9 2023 Elsevier Ltd",

      "abstract": "This paper investigates the resilient distributed secure output path following control problem of heterogeneous autonomous ground vehicles (AGVs) subject to cyber attacks based on reinforcement learning algorithm. Most existing results are subject to the same attack models for all communication channels, however multiple channels launched by different attackers are considered in this paper. First, a predictor-acknowledgement clock algorithm for each vehicle is proposed to judge whether the communication channel among neighboring vehicles is attacked or not by receiving or transmitting an acknowledgement. Then, a resilient distributed predictor is proposed to predict the pinning vehicle's state for each vehicle. In addition, a resilient local control protocol consisting of the feedforward state provided by the predictor and the local feedback state of each vehicle is developed for the output path following problem, which is further converted to the optimal control problem by designing a discounted performance function. Discounted algebraic Riccati equations (AREs) are derived to address the optimal control problem. An off-policy reinforcement learning (RL) algorithm is put forward to learn the solution of discounted AREs online without any prior knowledge of vehicles' dynamics. It is shown that the RL-based output path following control problem of AGVs imposed by cyber attacks can be achieved in an optimal manner. Finally, a numerical example is provided to verify the effectiveness of theoretical analysis. \u00c2\u00a9 2000-2011 IEEE.",

      "abstract": "Worldwide Internet traffic has seen phenomenal growth in recent years. The main cause of this exponential upsurge is bandwidth-hungry video streaming and content-sharing services. Caching video files at the edge nodes is a prospective solution for faster content transmission and improved user experience. In addition, the transcoding of video contents is also crucial to address diverse user requirements. While the goal of unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV)-assisted systems so far is on computation offloading, the utilization of UAVs for caching and transcoding was not considered. In this paper, the proposed strategy introduces UAVs to serve requests for video files locally and alleviate backhaul pressure. The proposed optimization model reduces content transmission delay by exploiting caching and transcoding facilities at the UAVs. In addition to the optimization problem formulation, a low-complexity heuristic algorithm is introduced to find an acceptable solution in real time. Simulation results confirm that the proposed UAV-assisted model achieves significant performance gain by reducing content transmission delay and offloading backhaul traffic. \u00c2\u00a9 2023",

      "abstract": "The rapid development of intelligent connected vehicles has increased the attack surface of vehicles and made the complexity of vehicle systems unprecedented. Original equipment manufacturers (OEMs) need to accurately represent and identify threats and match corresponding security requirements. Meanwhile, the fast iteration cycle of modern vehicles requires development engineers to quickly obtain cybersecurity requirements for new features in their developed systems in order to develop system code that meets cybersecurity requirements. However, existing threat identification and cybersecurity requirement methods in the automotive domain cannot accurately describe and identify threats for a new feature while also quickly matching appropriate cybersecurity requirements. This article proposes a cybersecurity requirements management system (CRMS) framework to assist OEM security experts in conducting comprehensive automated threat analysis and risk assessment and to help development engineers identify security requirements prior to software development. The proposed CRMS framework enables development engineers to quickly model their systems using the UML-based (i.e., capable of describing systems using UML) Eclipse Modeling Framework and security experts to integrate their security experience into a threat library and security requirement library expressed in Alloy formal language. In order to ensure accurate matching between the two, a middleware communication framework called the component channel messaging and interface (CCMI) framework, specifically designed for the automotive domain, is proposed. The CCMI communication framework enables the fast model of development engineers to match with the formal model of security experts for threat and security requirement matching, achieving accurate and automated threat and risk identification and security requirement matching. To validate our work, we conducted experiments on the proposed framework and compared the results with the HEAVENS approach. The results showed that the proposed framework is superior in terms of threat detection rates and coverage rates of security requirements. Moreover, it also saves analysis time for large and complex systems, and the cost-saving effect becomes more pronounced with increasing system complexity.",

As mmWave signal is sensitive to blockage, we introduce the unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV)-aided two-way relaying system for vehicular connection enhancement and coverage expansion. How to improve transmission efficiency and to reduce latency time in such a dynamic scenario is a challenging problem. In this paper, we formulate the joint optimization problem of relay selection and transmission scheduling, aiming to reduce transmission time while meeting the throughput requirements. To solve this problem, two schemes are proposed. The first one is the random relay selection with concurrent scheduling (RCS), a low-complexity algorithm implemented in two steps. The second one is the joint relay selection with dynamic scheduling (JRDS), which fully avoids relay contentions and exploits potential concurrent ability, to obtain further performance enhancement over RCS. Through extensive simulations under different environments with various flow numbers and vehicle speeds, we demonstrate that both RCS and JRDS schemes outperform the existing schemes significantly in terms of transmission time and network throughput. We also analyze the impact of threshold selection on achievable performance. \u00c2\u00a9 1967-2012 IEEE.",

      "abstract": "Connected and automated vehicles (CAVs) involving massive advanced sensors and electronic control units (ECUs) bring intelligentization to the transportation system and conveniences to human mobility. Unfortunately, these automated vehicles face security threats due to complexity and connectivity. Especially, the existing in-vehicle network protocols (e.g., controller area network) lack security consideration, which is vulnerable to malicious attacks and puts people at large-scale severe risks. In this paper, we propose a novel anomaly detection model that integrates a continuous wavelet transform (CWT) and convolutional neural network (CNN) for an in-vehicle network. By transforming in-vehicle sensor signals in different segments, we adopt CWT to calculate wavelet coefficients for vehicle state image construction so that the model exploits both the time and frequency domain characteristics of the raw data, which can demonstrate more hidden patterns of vehicle events and improve the accuracy of the follow-up detection process. Our model constructs a two-dimensional continuous wavelet transform scalogram (CWTS) and utilizes it as an input into our optimized CNN. The proposed model is able to provide local transient characteristics of the signals so that it can detect anomaly deviations caused by malicious behaviors, and the model is effective for coping with various vehicle anomalies. The experiments show the superior performance of our proposed model under different anomaly scenarios. Compared with related works, the average accuracy and F1 score are improved by 2.51% and 2.46%.",

In this paper, for the purpose of the correction of an error, we developed a method for the elimination of the influence of air turbulence on wind speed measurement. The corresponding correction model is obtained according to the CFD (Computational Fluid Dynamics) simulation of a six-rotor UAV which is carried out with the sliding grid method and the S-A turbulence model.

      "abstract": "In recent years, there has been a growing need for vehicles with air-water amphibious capacities for both military and civil applications, and the technological advances in unmanned systems make it more feasible to create such vehicles. As a result, the hybrid aquatic-aerial vehicle (HAAV), which integrates the locomotion capacity of aerial vehicles and underwater vehicles, is facing a vast developing opportunity, and plenty of related technologies have emerged. However, no current HAAV has simultaneously achieved the operational capacities of UUVs and UAVs in their moving domain without sacrificing performance. The exploitation of HAAVs is still facing several significant challenges, such as insufficient water-air compatibility, inefficient water-entry locomotion, and inefficient water-exit locomotion. The development trend of HAAVs could be more transparent, with the proposed technologies and design concepts being sorted out clearly. Therefore, a literature review of this novel vehicle is urgently in demand. We build this review on our previous survey published in 2015, which is regarded as the earliest review on HAAVs. In this paper, we put forward a novel systematic classification method of the fully functional HAAVs by considering the structure configurations and introduce the prototype development of each kind. Then, the research statuses of the drive solutions and trans-media solutions are analyzed respectively. After that, we analyze the demands of HAAVs both in the military and civil applications and evaluate the device performances of the various HAAVs. Furthermore, the applicability of each category is eventually obtained by comparing their device performances with the application demands of various applications. Finally, the challenges of water-air compatibility, water-entry locomotion, and water-exit locomotion are discussed. Moreover, the key technologies to overcome them, i.e., morphing blade techniques, morphing wing techniques, variable density techniques, structural buffer techniques, bionic water-entry techniques, surface dehydration techniques, and bionic water-exit techniques are analyzed. The research in this paper will provide more promising solutions for aquatic-aerial locomotion and inspire more practical studies in the HAAV field. \u00c2\u00a9 2023 The Authors",

      "abstract": "Unmanned aerial vehicles are subject to complex aerodynamic or hydrodynamic forces and various uncertainties, making their dynamic modeling difficult. Hence, in these systems, it is preferred to apply control techniques whose closed-loop systems can predict the system's uncertain dynamics and provide acceptable performance. To this end, this paper exploits a new neural network-based optimal mixed H2/H\u00e2\u0088\u009e control for a modified unmanned aerial vehicle to accomplish trajectory tracking missions. Firstly, the dynamic model of the modified unmanned aerial vehicles is presented. Then, the design procedure of the new controller is delineated. In this approach, H\u00e2\u0088\u009e attenuates the effect of uncertainties and through H2 the consumed control energy is minimized. Similar to real-world applications, it is supposed that there are control input constraints and external disturbances. The neural networks are also employed to estimate all uncertainties. The numerical simulations for two different desired paths are demonstrated. Simulation results illustrate the efficient performance of the proposed control technique in the presence of external disturbances, dynamic uncertainties, and control input constraints. \u00c2\u00a9 2022 COSPAR",

      "abstract": "Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) can be used to relay sensing information and computational workloads from ground users (GUs) to a remote base station (RBS) for further processing. In this paper, we employ multiple UAVs to assist with the collection of sensing information in a terrestrial wireless sensor network. All of the information collected by the UAVs can be forwarded to the RBS. We aim to improve the energy efficiency for sensing-data collection and transmission by optimizing UAV trajectory, scheduling, and access-control strategies. Considering a time-slotted frame structure, UAV flight, sensing, and information-forwarding sub-slots are confined to each time slot. This motivates the trade-off study between UAV access-control and trajectory planning. More sensing data in one time slot will take up more UAV buffer space and require a longer transmission time for information forwarding. We solve this problem by a multi-agent deep reinforcement learning approach that takes into consideration a dynamic network environment with uncertain information about the GU spatial distribution and traffic demands. We further devise a hierarchical learning framework with reduced action and state spaces to improve the learning efficiency by exploiting the distributed structure of the UAV-assisted wireless sensor network. Simulation results show that UAV trajectory planning with access control can significantly improve UAV energy efficiency. The hierarchical learning method is more stable in learning and can also achieve higher sensing performance.",

      "abstract": "The increasing usage of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) and their variants carrying complex weapon systems, known as unmanned combat aerial vehicles (UCAVs), has triggered a global revolution in complex military and commercial operations and has attracted researcher attention from different engineering disciplines in order to solve challenging problems regarding these modern vehicles. Path planning is a challenging problem for UAV and UCAV systems that requires the calculation of an optimal solution by considering enemy threats, total flight length, fuel or battery consumption, and some kinematic properties such as turning or climbing angles. In this study, the immune plasma (IP or IPA) algorithm, one of the most recent nature-inspired intelligent optimization methods, was modified by changing the default plasma transfer operations with a newly proposed technique called the extended treatment approach; extended IPA (ExtIPA) was then introduced as a path planner. To analyze the solving capabilities of the ExtIPA, 16 cases from five battlefield scenarios were tested by assigning different values to the algorithm-specific control parameters. The paths calculated with ExtIPA were compared with the paths found by planners on the basis of other intelligent optimization techniques. Comparative studies between ExtIPA and other techniques allowed for stating that the extended treatment approach significantly contributes to both the convergence speed and qualities of the obtained solutions and helps ExtIPA in performing better than its rivals in most cases.",

      "abstract": "Offline model-level testing of autonomous driving software is much cheaper, faster, and diversified than in-field, online system-level testing. Hence, researchers have compared empirically model-level vs system-level testing using driving simulators. They reported the general usefulness of simulators at reproducing the same conditions experienced in-field, but also some inadequacy of model-level testing at exposing failures that are observable only in online mode. In this work, we replicate the reference study on model vs system-level testing of autonomous vehicles while acknowledging several assumptions that we had reconsidered. These assumptions are related to several threats to validity affecting the original study that motivated additional analysis and the development of techniques to mitigate them. Moreover, we also extend the replicated study by evaluating the original findings when considering a physical, radio-controlled autonomous vehicle. Our results show that simulator-based testing of autonomous driving systems yields predictions that are close to the ones of real-world datasets when using neural-based translation to mitigate the reality gap induced by the simulation platform. On the other hand, model-level testing failures are in line with those experienced at the system level, both in simulated and physical environments, when considering the pre-failure site, similar-looking images, and accurate labels.",

      "abstract": "As one of the main disasters that limit the formation of wheat yield and affect the quality of wheat, lodging poses a great threat to safety production. Therefore, an improved PSPNet (Pyramid Scene Parsing Network) integrating the Normalization-based Attention Module (NAM) (NAM-PSPNet) was applied to the high-definition UAV RGB images of wheat lodging areas at the grain-filling stage and maturity stage with the height of 20 m and 40 m. First, based on the PSPNet network, the lightweight neural network MobileNetV2 was used to replace ResNet as the feature extraction backbone network. The deep separable convolution was used to replace the standard convolution to reduce the amount of model parameters and calculations and then improve the extraction speed. Secondly, the pyramid pool structure of multi-dimensional feature fusion was constructed to obtain more detailed features of UAV images and improve accuracy. Then, the extracted feature map was processed by the NAM to identify the less significant features and compress the model to reduce the calculation. The U-Net, SegNet and DeepLabv3+ were selected as the comparison models. The results show that the extraction effect at the height of 20 m and the maturity stage is the best. For the NAM-PSPNet, the MPA (Mean Pixel Accuracy), MIoU (Mean Intersection over Union), Precision, Accuracy and Recall is, respectively, 89.32%, 89.32%, 94.95%, 94.30% and 95.43% which are significantly better than the comparison models. It is concluded that NAM-PSPNet has better extraction performance for wheat lodging areas which can provide the decisionmaking basis for severity estimation, yield loss assessment, agricultural operation, etc.",

This, unlike the commonly used cold stamping, is a complicated process, combining heat treatment and plastic-forming methods. For this reason, permanent control at each stage is required. This includes, among others, measurement of the blank thickness, monitoring its heating process in the suitable atmosphere in the furnace, control of the forming process itself, measurement of shape-dimensional accuracy as well as mechanical parameters of the finished drawpiece. This paper discusses the method of controlling the values of production parameters during the hot stamping process of a selected drawpiece. For this purpose, digital twins of the production line and the stamping process, made in accordance with the assumptions of Industry 4.0, have been used. Individual components of the production line with sensors for monitoring process parameters have been shown. The system\u2019s response to emerging threats has also been described. The correctness of the adopted values is confirmed via tests of mechanical properties and the assessment of the shape-dimensional accuracy of a drawpiece test series.",

      "abstract": "The accurate, timely, and non-destructive estimation of maize total-above ground biomass (TAB) and theoretical biochemical methane potential (TBMP) under different phenological stages is a substantial part of agricultural remote sensing. The assimilation of UAV and machine learning (ML) data may be successfully applied in predicting maize TAB and TBMP; however, in the Nordic-Baltic region, these technologies are not fully exploited. Therefore, in this study, during the maize growing period, we tracked unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) based multispectral bands (blue, red, green, red edge, and infrared) at the main phenological stages. In the next step, we calculated UAV-based vegetation indices, which were combined with field measurements and different ML models, including generalized linear, random forest, as well as support vector machines. The results showed that the best ML predictions were obtained during the maize blister (R2)\u2013Dough (R4) growth period when the prediction models managed to explain 88\u201395% of TAB and 88\u201397% TBMP variation. However, for the practical usage of farmers, the earliest suitable timing for adequate TAB and TBMP prediction in the Nordic-Baltic area is stage V7\u2013V10. We conclude that UAV techniques in combination with ML models were successfully applied for maize TAB and TBMP estimation, but similar research should be continued for further improvements.",

      "abstract": "Integrating unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) into existing cellular networks encounters lots of challenges, among which one of the most striking concerns is how to achieve harmonious coexistence of aerial transceivers, inter alia, UAVs, and terrestrial user equipments (UEs). In this paper, a cellular-connected UAV network is focused, where multiple UAVs receive messages from base stations (BSs) in the down-link, while BSs are serving ground UEs in their cells. For effectively managing inter-cell interferences (ICIs) among UEs due to intense reuse of time-frequency resource block (RB) resource, a first p-tier based RB coordination criterion is proposed and adopted. Then, to enhance wireless transmission quality for UAVs while protecting terrestrial UEs from being interfered by ground-to-air (G2A) transmissions, a radio resource management (RRM) problem of joint dynamic RB coordination and time-varying beamforming design minimizing UAV's ergodic outage duration (EOD) is investigated. To cope with conventional optimization techniques' inefficiency in solving the formulated RRM problem, a deep reinforcement learning (DRL)-aided solution is initiated, where deep double duelling Q network (D3QN) and twin delayed deep deterministic policy gradient (TD3) are invoked to deal with RB coordination in discrete action domain and beamforming design in continuous action regime, respectively. The hybrid D3QN-TD3 solution is trained via interacting with the considered outer and inner environments in an online centralized manner so that it can then help achieve the suboptimal EOD minimization performance during its offline decentralized exploitation. Simulation results have illustrated the effectiveness of the proposed hybrid D3QN-TD3 algorithm, compared to several representative baselines. \u00c2\u00a9 1972-2012 IEEE.",

An improved Q-learning reinforcement learning algorithm based on prior knowledge is proposed to solve the problem of slow convergence and low learning efficiency in mobile robot path planning. Prior knowledge is used to initialize the Q-value, so as to guide the agent to move toward the target direction with a greater probability from the early stage of the algorithm, eliminating a large number of invalid iterations. The greedy factor \u03b5 is dynamically adjusted based on the number of times the agent successfully reaches the target position, so as to better balance exploration and exploitation and accelerate convergence.

However, due to the limited computational hardware on board such aircraft and the uncertain, stochastic nature of real-world environments, there is a need for efficient and robust strategies that exhibit generalized behavior. In addressing these objectives, recent efforts have explored the use of artificial intelligence training algorithms and neural networks for the design of autonomous control schemes that exploit such wind phenomena. This study incorporates the Neuroevolution of Augmenting Topologies algorithm with domain randomization to train robust neurocontrollers that can control an aircraft along sustained traveling dynamic soaring trajectories in the presence of uncertainties and disturbances. This work presents the developed strategy for integrating robustness in neural network control systems, provides a method for quantifying and comparing robustness, and introduces an approach for identifying the network characteristics that contribute to the evolved robust behavior. \u00c2\u00a9 2022 by Eric J.

      "abstract": "In this paper, we aim to exploit an effective way to solve the output multi-formation tracking problem of the networked autonomous surface vehicles (ASVs) in a fast fixed time manner. Specifically, addressing the output multi-formation tracking problem implies that 1) the networked ASVs are divided into multiple interconnected subnetworks with respect to multiple targets; 2) for each subnetwork, the outputs of the networked ASVs form a desired geometric formation with exchanging the local interactions. Besides, solving the fast fixed-time tracking problem in this paper implies that 1) the convergence time is independent of the initial conditions; 2) the system states are forced to reach the employed nonsingular fixed-time sliding surface in a prescribed time, which thus called fast fixed-time control. Then, based on a time-related function and a nonsingular fixed-time sliding surface, a hierarchical fast fixed-time control algorithm is proposed to solve the aforementioned problem within a fast fixed time being independent of the initial conditions. Furthermore, by employing the Lyapunov argument and mathematical induction, we present the sufficient conditions for fast fixed-time convergence of the tracking errors with respect to multiple targets. Finally, numerous simulation examples are presented to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed control algorithm. \u00c2\u00a9 1967-2012 IEEE.",

      "abstract": "Cardiovascular is nowadays a common and threatening disease for humans. Computer-aided diagnostic (CAD) can diagnose cardiovascular by finding anomalies in an electrocardiogram (ECG). However, this conventional diagnostic approach is inefficient and needs extensive analysis and medical knowledge to diagnose accurately. Deep learning can help in the timely detection of anomalies. ECG being a multi-tone signal, CNN-based temporal features are not sufficient for classification. A classification can be improved by integrating multi-spectral information with temporal features. Furthermore, the one-dimension (1D) ECG signal needs complex preprocessing, including signal cleaning and RR peak detection, whereas deep CNN is more efficient for 2D signals. This paper proposes an automated CAD system for ECG classification using a 2D deep-convolution network (CNN). The proposed CNN uses multi-spectral information by integrating wavelet-based spectral features with CNN\u2019s temporal features. The 1D ECG is reshaped to a 2D image, and a wavelet-encoded 2D CNN is proposed to classify these 2D images into four classes. The proposed model is evaluated using MIT-BIH datasets containing two-channel ambulatory ECG signals. A comparative study of both 1D and 2D approaches using deep CNN is presented in the paper initially. Later, the proposed network is validated by evaluating various quantitative parameters using the MIT-BIH dataset, and a comparative analysis is shown. The proposed CNN outperformed other models achieving the highest accuracy of 99.52% and 95.64% F1 score. The study reveals that the proposed model avoids the complex preprocessing of the ECG signals of cleaning, RR point detection, and waveform cropping. Further integration of wavelet-based multi-spectral features in CNN has improved the classification accuracy.",

However, the data collected through them include personal information such as peoples\u2019 faces and vehicle license plates. Currently, personal information contained in data is de-identified using methods such as face blur, pixelation, and masking. Consequently, it loses value as data for artificial intelligence (AI) learning. Therefore, in this study, we propose a model to generate a fake face that maintains the basic structure of the human face. There are several methods for generating faces. One is to generate them using a generative adversarial network (GAN) model. The GAN is an AI algorithm used for unsupervised learning and is implemented by a system in which two neural networks compete. However, because GAN operates as an input of a random noise vector, it is difficult to obtain results for the desired face angle and shape. Therefore, pre- and post-processing is required to generate a fake face that maintains the basic structure and angles; however, the calculation is complicated, and it is difficult to generate a natural image. To solve this problem, we propose a method for generating a fake face that maintains the basic structure and angle of the real face by applying a facial landmark. Using the proposed method, it was possible to generate a fake face with a different impression while maintaining the basic structure and angle of the face.",

      "abstract": "During long-distance flight, unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) need to perform cross-domain authentication to prove their identity and receive information from the ground control station (GCS). However, the GCS needs to verify all drones arriving at the area it is responsible for, which leads to the GCS being unable to complete authentication in time when facing cross-domain requests from a large number of drones. Additionally, due to potential threats from attackers, drones and GCSs are likely to be deceived. To improve the efficiency and security of cross-domain authentication, we propose an efficient blockchain-based cross-domain authentication scheme for the Internet of Drones (BCDAIoD). By using a consortium chain with a multi-chain architecture, the proposed method can query and update different types of data efficiently. By mutual authentication before cross-domain authentication, drones can compose drone groups to lighten the authentication workload of domain management nodes. BCDAIoD uses the notification mechanism between domains to enable path planning for drones in advance, which can further improve the efficiency of cross-domain authentication. The performance of BCDAIoD was evaluated through experiments. The results show that the cross-domain authentication time cost and computational overhead of BCDAIoD are significantly lower those of than existing methods when the number of drones is large.",

Transmissibility operators were shown to be exceptional in signal estimation. However, it is also shown to be noncausal and thus can only be used offline. To this end, we propose using Data Aggregation (DAgger), an extension to imitation learning, to transfer the classification experience from transmissibility operators to a novice machine learning agent to be used online. The integration of transmissibility-DAgger gives the ability to adapt to new fault classes without the need to re-train the diagnosis model from the beginning. A heterogeneous CAV platoon was modeled with three different faults separately. These faults are actuator disturbances, false data injection attacks, and communication time delays. The classification scheme depends on estimating the faulty signal in the case of each fault class. Next, the measured faulty signal is compared with the three estimations, and the closer fault estimation to the measured one is considered the actual fault on the platoon. The proposed algorithm is then tested on the platoon model and then applied to an experimental setup that consists of three autonomous robots. The proposed results are compared with six different machine learning classification models. The overall classification accuracy achieved was 95.8% for the experiment using the proposed approach. \u00c2\u00a9 2023 Elsevier Ltd",

      "abstract": "This paper is concerned with the security sliding mode-based leader-following control of multiple autonomous unmanned underwater vehicles (AUVs) system subject to stochastic DoS attacks. Firstly, a Bernoulli variable is used to describe the phenomenon of stochastic DoS attacks between controllers and actuators, and the attack probability is known for controller design. Secondly, the closed-loop system is established by taking the integral sliding mode control scheme and stochastic DoS attacks into account. Then, the conditions of stochastic stability for system are given by using the stochastic systems analysis method and the model decomposition technique. In the simulation part, a group of AUVs models is used to verify the validity of the proposed state consensus control scheme. The simulation example shows that all the state can achieve consensus even in presence of randomly launched DoS attack. \u00c2\u00a9 IMechE 2022.",

      "abstract": "Autonomous Vehicles (AVs) exchange real-time and seamless data between other AVs and the network, thus revolutionizing the Intelligent Transportation System (ITS). Automated transportation brings numerous benefits to human beings. However, the concerns such as safety, security, and privacy keep rising. In navigation and trajectory planning, the AVs require exchanging sensory information from their own and other AVs. In such cases, when a malicious AV or faulty sensor-equipped AV comes into connectivity, it can have disruptive consequences. This paper proposes a Hybrid Deep Anomaly Detection (HDAD) approach for effective anomaly detection and cyber-attack mitigation in AVs. The Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL) algorithm in HDAD approach acts over the 6G network to combat new-age cyber-attacks and provide a swift and accurate anomaly detection mechanism. In conjunction with Maximum Entropy Inverse Reinforcement Learning (MaxEntIRL), the HDAD approach identifies and isolates malicious AVs. It is envisioned that the obtained results prove the effectiveness of HDAD and have an 8.2% higher accuracy rate than the existing systems. \u00c2\u00a9 2013 IEEE.",

The simulation contents are the four-stage motion processes of the \u00e2\u0080\u009cparachute-UAV system\u00e2\u0080\u009d after separation from the balloon platform, including the straightening stage, the inflation process, the stable descend under the influence of the wing deployment action, and the trajectory leveling of the UAV. The \u00e2\u0080\u009cparachute-UAV system\u00e2\u0080\u009d is equivalent to a multi rigid body connection structure. We introduce the straightening length parameter and the wing deployment angles based on the Kane method to establish the dynamic model. And we choose the inflation time method to simulate the parachute deployment process and the flat plate high angle of attack model to describe the wing aerodynamic force. In the simulation, we compare six launching processes of different wing deployment time periods and obtain the separation state of each UAV when cut from the parachute. We adopt the Radau Pseudo-Spectral method to calculate the leveling trajectory of six UAVs. This paper is an engineering application research study and can provide a simulation reference for the launching test of the balloon-borne folding wing UAV system. \u00c2\u00a9 IMechE 2022.",

      "abstract": "Over-exploitation of coal mines leads to surface subsidence, surface cracks, collapses, landslides, and other geological disasters. Taking a mining area in Nalintaohai Town, Ejin Horo Banner, Ordos City, Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region, as an example, Sentinel-1A data from January 2018 to October 2019 were used as the data source in this study. Based on the high interference coherence of the permanent scatterer (PS) over a long period of time, the problem of the manual selection of ground control points (GCPs) affecting the monitoring results during refinement and re-flattening is solved. A DInSAR-PS-Stacking method combining the PS three-threshold method (the coherence coefficient threshold, amplitude dispersion index threshold, and deformation velocity interval) is proposed as a means to select ground control points for refinement and re-flattening, as well as a means to obtain time-series deformation by weighted stacking processing. A SBAS-PS-InSAR method combining the PS three-threshold method to select PS points as GCPs for refinement and re-flattening is also proposed. The surface deformation results monitored by the DInSAR-PS-Stacking and SBAS-PS-InSAR methods are analyzed and verified. The results show that the subsidence location, range, distribution, and space\u2013time subsidence law of surface deformation results obtained by DInSAR-PS-Stacking, SBAS-PS-InSAR, and GPS methods are basically the same. The deformation results obtained by these two InSAR methods have a good correlation with the GPS monitoring results, and the MAE and RMSE are within the acceptable range. The error showed that the edge of the subsidence basin was small and that the center was large. Both methods were found to be able to effectively monitor the coal mine, but there were also shortcomings. DInSAR-PS-Stacking has a strong ability to monitor the settlement center. SBAS-PS-InSAR performed well in monitoring slow and small deformations, but its monitoring of the settlement center was insufficient. Considering the advantages of these two InSAR methods, we proposed fusing the time-series deformation results obtained using these two InSAR methods to allow for more reliable deformation results and to carry out settlement analysis. The results showed that the automatic two-threshold (deformation threshold and average coherence threshold) fusion was effective for monitoring and analysis, and the deformation monitoring results are in good agreement with the actual situation. The deformation information obtained by the comparison, and fusion of multiple methods can allow for better monitoring and analysis of the mining area surface deformation, and can also provide a scientific reference for mining subsidence control and early disaster warning.",

These challenges require informed decisions not only at headquarters, but also at the edge of the battlefield, together with network-enabled skills and agile Command and Control (C2) Systems. The C2 system should ensure a timely and secure dissemination of information, obtained from interconnected devices, such as radars, unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV), sensors, armored combat vehicles and wearable devices. These networked sensors and effectors constitute the Internet of Battle Things (IoBT). This work investigates a secure network strategy to achieve C2 agility in the IoBT heterogeneous environment, by coupling the application and network with a multi-layer, defense-in-depth cybersecurity mechanism at the hardware, network and application level. The planned framework uses the Software-Defined Networking (SDN) paradigm to orchestrate network services, by means of semantics-oriented data from technologies such as Information Centric Networks (ICN) and Delay-Tolerant Networks (DTN). The results from preliminary simulated scenarios showed a significant improvement in network metrics, as well as network resilience to withstand cyber-attacks. \u00c2\u00a9 1979-2012 IEEE.",

      "abstract": "Steganography algorithms are designed by human experts and use rule-based methods to hide the secret data inside a cover medium. Recently, this process has been automated by using Generative Adversarial Networks. However, Generative Adversarial Networks based steganography has certain limitations. These algorithms may not generate steganographic images that are real enough to fool the intruder. Security of steganography degrades as embedding capacity is increased. A new framework for improved steganography based on deep learning is proposed in this paper. The new framework uses color models with Generative Adversarial Networks. Popular color models such as HSV, YCrCb, YDbDr, CIE-XYZ, YIQ, HED, and YUV are analyzed. The proposed framework helps to identify the best color model with Generative Adversarial Networks based steganography. The quality of steganographic images is assessed with three metrics: capacity, security, and invisibility. Extensive experimentation has been carried out with the CelebA dataset which has more than 200&nbsp;K samples to assess the effectiveness of the proposed framework. The results show that compared with the RGB and other color models, the CIE-XYZ model produces the best results with Generative Adversarial Networks for steganography.The results further show that the proposed framework improves the security of steganography even when the embedding capacity is increased.",

Furthermore, the existence of early warning systems (EWS) at subnational level is unclear. This study aims at mapping and characterizing EWS for microbiological threats available at regional level in Italy, focusing on emerging AMR, and at outlining potential barriers and facilitators to their development/implementation. To this end, a three-section, web-based survey was developed and administered to all Italian regional AMR representatives from June to August 2022. Twenty out of twenty-one regions and autonomous provinces (95.2%) responded to the survey. Among these, nine (45%) reported the implementation of EWS for microbiological threats at regional level, three (15%) reported that EWS are in the process of being developed, and eight (40%) reported that EWS are not currently available. EWS characteristics varied widely among the identified systems concerning both AMR profiles reported and data flow: the microorganisms most frequently included were extensively drug-resistant (XDR) Enterobacterales, with the lack of a dedicated regional IT platform reported in most cases. The results of this study depict a highly heterogeneous scenario and suggest that more efforts aimed at strengthening national AMR surveillance systems are needed.",

      "abstract": "Vehicle-to-Infrastructure (V2I) communication is the key requirement in various applications of Vehicular Ad-hoc Network (VANET). However, due to the use of unguided media, V2I communication may suffer from threat to security, privacy, and application data confidentiality. Besides, user revocation and re-registration also play important roles to manage the subscriber\u2019s service validity. Recently, many protocols have been discussed to secure V2I communication. Unfortunately, none could fulfill the desired goals. Additionally, most of the existing protocols does not address user revocation and re-registration. In this paper, we propose an anonymous and authenticated V2I communication with a simplified user revocation and re-registration strategy. The security of the protocol under attacks (passive/active) is ensured using hash-based security and Elliptic Curve Discrete Logarithmic Problem&nbsp;(ECDLP). We discuss a simplified approach for user revocation and re-registration which relaxes the use of a separate revocation list. Additionally, our protocol concentrates on the anonymity of roadside units. We present both formal and informal security analysis to prove the robustness of the protocol under security attacks. The formal&nbsp;security analysis is done based on eavesdropping, forward/backward secrecy, and many other active attacks (e.g., ESL attack, password guessing attack, etc.), whereas the informal security analysis is done based on various security and privacy parameters such as privacy of VU and RSU, forward/backward secrecy, conditional privacy, and many other active/passive attacks. Besides, we employ AVISPA tool-based automated simulation to ensure the security under replay, man-in-the-middle, and impersonation attacks. The performance analysis section illustrates that our protocol preserves increased security and privacy factors than other similar protocols.",

      "abstract": "Many map matching-based localization algorithms estimate the autonomous car's pose using a registration between lanes measured by a camera and the High-Definition (HD) map. However, the registration methods based on numerical optimization, such as the Iterative Closest Point (ICP) and Normal Distributions Transform (NDT), can cause underdetermined problems due to no unique solution when matching under-constrained lane shapes such as straight lines and circular arcs. This paper proposes a robust localization algorithm with centimeter-level accuracy by applying different matching techniques depending on the road shape. We proposed a road shape classification-based map matching algorithm to overcome the under-constrained problems, which have no unique solution due to insufficient constraints. The proposed algorithm classifies lane segments into line, arc, and clothoid curves considering their curvature characteristics. After that, we find correction information through a map matching and covariance estimation method using lane pairs with the same type of their shape. For the under-constrained shapes, the geometry-based map-matching algorithm and covariance estimation method are applied to avoid underdetermined results. Finally, the measurement calculated from the correction information and predicted pose of the ego-vehicle is exploited for the measurement update of the Extended Kalman Filter (EKF). The proposed method was quantitatively evaluated in the simulation environment, which contains various road shapes, and qualitatively validated for experimental data from an autonomous driving platform. The proposed algorithm shows more robust matching capability, efficient computation time, and higher accuracy than the localization system based on ICP-based lane matching. \u00c2\u00a9 2016 IEEE.",

      "abstract": "Pine wilt disease (PWD), caused by pine wood nematode (PWN, Bursaphelenchus xylophilus), poses a serious threat to the coniferous forests in China. This study used unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV)-based hyperspectral imaging conducted at different altitudes to investigate the impact of spatio-temporal scales on PWD detection in an monoculture Masson pine plantation. The influence of spatio-temporal scales on hyperspectral responses of pine trees infected with PWD and detection accuracies were evaluated by Jeffries\u2013Matusita (J-M) distances and the random forest (RF) algorithm. The optimal vegetation indices (VIs) and spatial resolutions were identified by comparing feature importance and model accuracy. The main results showed that the VIs and J-M distances were greatly affected by spatio-temporal scales. In the early, mid-, and late infection stages, the RF-based PWD detection model had accuracies ranging between 72.05 and 79.48%, 83.71 and 89.59%, and 96.81 and 99.28%, peaking at the 10 cm, 8 cm, and 4 cm spatial resolutions, respectively. The green normalized difference vegetation index (GNDVI) and red edge position (REP) were the optimal VIs in early and mid-infection stages, respectively. This study can be important to improve the efficiency of PWD detection and reducing the loss of forests resources.",

The underlying system is described by the fuzzy model by decomposing the nonlinear plant into some local linear subsystems. An input saturating integrator and an antiwindup compensator are introduced inside a dynamic output feedback fuzzy controller to handle the input saturation in both amplitude and rate. Within the resulting fuzzy-model-based control framework, a novel adaptive event-triggered-based resilient control method is proposed to ensure that the insecure and imperfect system is stochastically stable with an H\u00e2\u0088\u009e performance level.

      "abstract": "In recent times, the autonomous systems have gained considerable interest due to their improved performance and lesser requirements for manual support. The autonomous systems have been extensively implemented in various domains such as logistics, industries, health care, finance, and so on. Intelligence control is the incorporation of autonomous and Artificial Intelligence (AI) systems that assist in critical decision-making steps. Autonomous driving is a new field in intelligent transportation systems that requires automated classification, detection, and the ranging of on-road difficulties. Therefore, the current study develops an Improved Metaheuristics technique with Deep Learning-based Object Detectors for Intelligent Control in Autonomous Vehicles (IMDLOD-ICAV). The presented technique mainly detects the objects to assist, in driving the autonomous vehicles. In the current research work, the RetinaNet model is applied as an object detector whereas the hyperparameter tuning process is executed with the help of the Nadam optimizer. Besides, the Elman Neural Network (ENN) model is also exploited to recognize the objects with a high accuracy. The parameter tuning process is performed with the help of the Improved Dragonfly Algorithm (IDFA). The authors conducted a comprehensive set of experiments to establish the superior performance of the proposed IMDLOD-ICAV technique. The outcomes confirmed the enhanced performance of the IMDLOD-ICAV technique with a maximum accuracy of 99.38%. \u00c2\u00a9 2023 Elsevier Ltd",

      "abstract": "With the development of AI, the intelligence level of vehicles is increasing. Structured roads, as common and important traffic scenes, are the most typical application scenarios for realizing autonomous driving. The driving behavior decision-making of intelligent vehicles has always been a controversial and difficult research topic. Currently, the mainstream decision-making methods, which are mainly based on rules, lack adaptability and generalization to the environment. Aimed at the particularity of intelligent vehicle behavior decisions and the complexity of the environment, this thesis proposes an intelligent vehicle driving behavior decision method based on DQN generative adversarial imitation learning (DGAIL) in the structured road traffic environment, in which the DQN algorithm is utilized as a GAIL generator. The results show that the DGAIL method can preserve the design of the reward value function, ensure the effectiveness of training, and achieve safe and efficient driving on structured roads. The experimental results show that, compared with A3C, DQN and GAIL, the model based on DGAIL spends less average training time to achieve a 95% success rate in the straight road scene and merging road scene, respectively. Apparently, this algorithm can effectively accelerate the selection of actions, reduce the randomness of actions during the exploration, and improve the effect of the decision-making model.",

      "abstract": "Inertial odometry is an attractive solution to the problem of state estimation for agile quadrotor flight. It is inexpensive, lightweight, and it is not affected by perceptual degradation. However, only relying on the integration of the inertial measurements for state estimation is infeasible. The errors and time-varying biases present in such measurements cause the accumulation of large drift in the pose estimates. Recently, inertial odometry has made significant progress in estimating the motion of pedestrians. State-of-the-art algorithms rely on learning a motion prior that is typical of humans but cannot be transferred to drones. In this work, we propose a learning-based odometry algorithm that uses an inertial measurement unit (IMU) as the only sensor modality for autonomous drone racing tasks. The core idea of our system is to couple a model-based filter, driven by the inertial measurements, with a learning-based module that has access to the thrust measurements. We show that our inertial odometry algorithm is superior to the state-of-the-art filter-based and optimization-based visual-inertial odometry as well as the state-of-the-art learned-inertial odometry in estimating the pose of an autonomous racing drone. Additionally, we show that our system is comparable to a visual-inertial odometry solution that uses a camera and exploits the known gate location and appearance. We believe that the application in autonomous drone racing paves the way for novel research in inertial odometry for agile quadrotor flight. \u00c2\u00a9 2016 IEEE.",

      "abstract": "Geolocation is a fundamental component of route planning and navigation for unmanned vehicles, but GNSS-based geolocation fails under denial-of-service conditions. Cross-view geo-localization (CVGL), which aims to estimate the geographic location of the ground-level camera by matching against enormous geo-tagged aerial (e.g., satellite) images, has received a lot of attention but remains extremely challenging due to the drastic appearance differences across aerial\u2013ground views. In existing methods, global representations of different views are extracted primarily using Siamese-like architectures, but their interactive benefits are seldom taken into account. In this paper, we present a novel approach using cross-view knowledge generative techniques in combination with transformers, namely mutual generative transformer learning (MGTL), for CVGL. Specifically, by taking the initial representations produced by the backbone network, MGTL develops two separate generative sub-modules\u2014one for aerial-aware knowledge generation from ground-view semantics and vice versa\u2014and fully exploits the entirely mutual benefits through the attention mechanism. Moreover, to better capture the co-visual relationships between aerial and ground views, we introduce a cascaded attention masking algorithm to further boost accuracy. Extensive experiments on challenging public benchmarks, i.e., CVACT and CVUSA, demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method, which sets new records compared with the existing state-of-the-art models. Our code will be available upon acceptance.",

      "abstract": "Currently, sensing and communication are two indispensable functions in the UAV platform while these two modules are independent in hardware. However, the similarities between them seem a growing trend, such as hardware, channel characteristics, signal processing methods, etc. Integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) has been the hot topic to alleviate the issue of low spectrum efficiency and pursuit the hardware gain and integration gain as far as possible. As the vital platform for the sensing and communication functions, UAV is facing great potential for development when meeting ISAC. If ISAC load replaces the independent communication load and sensing load, UAV will be more flexible due to the reduction of load weight. Moreover, the capacity of sensing and communication functions will be mutually beneficial, gradually deriving a new information theory. Motivated by this, this article focuses on the possible challenges and future directions of ISAC-empowered UAV. More specifically, ISAC between UAV and base station is firstly discussed from the angles of base station for UAV and UAV for base station. Then, ISAC with UAV swarm is exploited, including ISAC for swarm internal, ISAC for swarm external and ISAC-enabled UAV swarm. Finally, UAV-assisted sensing for ground targets is analyzed. This article aims at providing our superficial opinions for ISAC-enabled UAV and UAV-assisted ISAC, promoting the further progress of ISAC, UAV and their integration. \u00c2\u00a9 1979-2012 IEEE.",

      "abstract": "This paper focuses on the intervehicle security-based robust formation control of unmanned surface vehicles (USVs) to implement the formation switch mission. In the scheme, a novel adaptive potential ship (APS)-based guidance principle is developed to prevent intervehicle collisions, which is common and threatening when maneuvering a formation switch. By employing the artificial potential field (APF), the APS can program the real-time attitude reference for USVs by using the security intervehicle distance while achieving the path-following task. As for the control part, a robust adaptive formation control algorithm is proposed to effectively stabilize the USVs to the APS via the fusion of the disturbance observer (DOB) and by using the robust neural damping technique. Regarding the merits of the improved design of the DOB, the weight compression of the neural networks can effectively simplify the structure of the DOB and enhance the observation accuracy of the external disturbance. This can facilitate the avoidance of intervehicle collisions and guarantee the application of the theoretical algorithm in engineering practice. Considerable effort has been made to obtain the semiglobally uniform ultimate bounded (SGUUB) stability via theoretical analysis. Finally, with the sailing scene in a narrow channel, the simulated experiment is illustrated to verify the security performance of the proposed strategy.",

      "abstract": "We experimentally investigate leading-edge separation control effect by bionic coverts with various materials and sawteeth shapes in wind tunnel tests. The artificial flexible coverts, bio-inspired by bird covert feathers on upper wings, are hinged at the trailing-edge of a NACA 0018 airfoil at a constant high angle-of-attack of 15\u00c2\u00b0. The chord-based Reynolds number is 1.0 \u00c3\u0097 105 in the generic range of bird flight in nature and low-speed fixed-wing unmanned aerial vehicles. The velocity profiles in the wake flow are measured by multi-channel hot-wire anemometer. By comparing the mean velocity profiles and root-mean-square velocities, we find the trailing-edge coverts reduced the thickness of the shear layers by 0.05 chord length. The turbulence intensity of the trailing- and leading-edge shear layers are reduced 34% and 5%, respectively. Further wavelet analysis reveals that the large sizes of vortices are considerably suppressed in the time-frequency spectrum. Based on the hot-wire datasets, we develop a novel multi-dimensional genetic algorithm to analyze the featured ordered structures in the shear layers and quantitatively characterize the amplitude modulation between the large- and small-scale flow structures. As a result, we find that the coverts-generated perturbations induce an increase in the high-frequency (f = 91.2 Hz) coherence between the leading- and trailing-edge shear layers from 40% to 70%, leading to a reduction of the flow separation bubble on the upper wing. The present work reveals that the artificial bionic coverts have leading-edge flow separation control effectiveness and shows the engineering potential for aircrafts and unmanned aerial vehicles. \u00c2\u00a9 IMechE 2022.",

      "abstract": "With the rapid development of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), often referred to as drones, their security issues are attracting more and more attention. Due to open-access communication environments, UAVs may raise security concerns, including authentication threats as well as the leakage of location and other sensitive data to unauthorized entities. Elliptic curve cryptography (ECC) is widely favored in authentication protocol design due to its security and performance. However, we found it still has the following two problems: inflexibility and a lack of backward security. This paper proposes an ECC-based identity authentication protocol LAPEC for UAVs. LAPEC can guarantee the backward secrecy of session keys and is more flexible to use. The time cost of LAPEC was analyzed, and its overhead did not increase too much when compared with other authentication methods.",

Most existing works exploit static road graphs to characterize scenarios and are limited in modeling evolving spatio-temporal dependencies in dynamic scenarios. In this letter, we resort to dynamic heterogeneous graphs to model the scenario. Various scenario components including vehicles (agents) and lanes, multi-type interactions, and their changes over time are jointly encoded. Furthermore, we design a novel heterogeneous graph convolutional recurrent network, aggregating diverse interaction information and capturing their evolution, to learn to exploit intrinsic spatio-temporal dependencies in dynamic graphs and obtain effective representations of dynamic scenarios. Finally, with a motion forecasting decoder, our model predicts realistic and multi-modal future trajectories of agents and outperforms state-of-the-art published works on several motion forecasting benchmarks. \u00c2\u00a9 2016 IEEE.",

      "abstract": "Sensors and actuators are fundamental units in Cyber\u2013Physical and Internet of Things systems. Because they are included in a variety of systems, using many technologies, it is very useful to characterize their functions abstractly by describing them as Abstract Entity Patterns (AEPs), which are patterns that describe abstract conceptual entities. From AEPs, we can derive concrete patterns; a structure combining related AEPs is an Entity Solution Frame (ESF). This paper concentrates on the functional aspects of these devices and defines conceptual units that can be used to design any system that requires sensors and actuators; that is, almost any Cyber\u2013Physical system. For concreteness, we explore them in this study in the context of autonomous cars. An autonomous car is a complex system because, in addition to its own complex design, it interacts with other vehicles and with the surrounding infrastructure. To handle these functions, it must incorporate various technologies from different sources. An autonomous car is an example of a Cyber\u2013Physical System, where some of its functions are performed via Internet of Things units. Sensors are extensively used in autonomous cars to measure physical quantities; actuators are commanded by controllers to perform appropriate physical actions. Both sensors and actuators are susceptible to malicious attacks due to the large attack surface of the system in which they are used. Our work is intended to make autonomous cars more secure, which also increases their safety. Our final objective is to build a Security Solution Frame for sensors and actuators of autonomous cars that will facilitate their secure design. A Security Solution Frame is a solution structure that groups together and organizes related security patterns.",

      "abstract": "An unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) is an autonomous flying robot that has attracted the interest of several communities because of its capacity to increase the safety and productivity of labor. In terms of software engineering, UAV system development is extremely difficult because the focus is not only on functional requirement fulfillment, but also on nonfunctional requirements such as security and safety, which play a crucial role in mission success. Consequently, architecture robustness is very important, and one of the most common architectures developed is based on a centralized pattern in which all UAVs are controlled from a central location. Even though this is a very important problem, many developers must expend a great deal of effort to adapt and improve security. This is because there are few practical perspectives of security development in the context of UAV system development; therefore, the study of attack and defense patterns in centralized architecture is required to fill this knowledge gap. This paper concentrates on enhancing the security aspect of UAV system development by examining attack and defense patterns in centralized architectures. We contribute to the field by identifying 26 attack variations, presenting corresponding countermeasures from a software analyst\u2019s standpoint, and supplying a node.js code template for developers to strengthen their systems\u2019 security. Our comprehensive analysis evaluates the proposed defense strategies in terms of time and space complexity, ensuring their effectiveness. By providing a focused and in-depth perspective on security patterns, our research offers crucial guidance for communities and developers working on UAV-based systems, facilitating the development of more secure and robust solutions.",

      "abstract": "The use of robots in the modern world is widespread, not only in medicine and automated vehicles, but also in national security, defense, and industry. Together with the growing number of robots there is also an increase of cyber attacks against robots and in general of their security issues. Thus, we consider cyber security and related issues such as robots vulnerabilities from different perspectives that need to be investigated in order to understand strengths and weaknesses of robots. The aim of this paper is to cover the topic of cyber security in robots in a more focused and comprehensive way with respect to what has been done previously in literature. Throughout our comprehensive survey, we discuss also different aspects related to threats, attacks, and available methods for preventing malicious behavior from robots. As a result of our investigation, it has been found that robots' data, software, network, and hardware are the most vulnerable components. During this review, eventually current approaches to protect robots are discussed in order to maintain their integrity, availability, and confidentiality. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the likelihood of cyber security risks on robotic platforms can be significantly reduced through improvements in encryption, authorization/authentication, and physical security. Security level of different robotic systems is analyzed in different fields so as to determine whether the security needs to be upgraded or rectified. We also present and describe open challenges that can arise in the next few years. This paper aims at being a starting point for researchers and practitioners to understand and upgrade the cyber security of robots. \u00c2\u00a9 2023 The Author(s)",

      "abstract": "As one of the typical applications of cyberphysical system (CPS), autonomous vehicles (AVs) are vulnerable to malicious disturbance from cyberattacks while tracking the desired path. This article focuses on CPS-based path tracking control problem of AVs under cyberattacks. First, the nonlinear state and measurement equations of AVs under cyberattacks are established based on vehicle dynamics model. Second, to improve the robustness of AVs against cyberattacks, sensor redundancy is introduced. A cyberattack detection method is designed by using extended Kalman filter, and the computational complexity of the cyberattack detection method is analyzed. In addition, sensor switching rules are developed to isolate the disturbance of cyberattacks. Then, the control problem of the AVs is formulated based on model predictive control. Input-to-state stability of the control system under cyberattacks is established, and a link between the tolerable attack intensity and the detection thresholds is clearly revealed. Finally, the simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed control strategy. \u00c2\u00a9 2005-2012 IEEE.",

      "abstract": "The analysis was carried out concerning the regulatory requirements for fire safety aimed at preventing the spread of fire from the parking lot of motor vehicles to various buildings and structures located on the territory of industrial use, as well as an analysis of fires on the motor vehicles. The need is shown related to applying a calculation estimate of the possibility of ignition of a fire-hazardous irradiated material from the effect of a radiated heat flux during a fire for establishing a fire-prevention distance. To assess the fulfillment of fire safety requirements aimed at preventing the spread of fire with the subsequent establishment of a fire-pre-vention distance from the parking lot of motor vehicles, it is required to implement the calculated scenarios. Scenarios should consider the type (body, opening), the location of the surface (front, rear, side) and its calculated values, the number of motor vehicles, the burning and irradiated materials with their calculated values, the location of the irradiated material relative to the radiating surface (centered, perpen-dicular, outside zone center). They are based on the mechanism of ignition of the irradiated material from the action of a radiant heat flux during the combustion of a motor vehicle. The practical use of this technique will allow to simulate the threat of propagation of the radiated heat flux to nearby protection objects, to establish a safe distance from the parking of motor vehicles to various buildings and structures for industrial purposes, and to make decisions on the compliance of protection objects with fire safety requirements. To carry out calculations to determine the safe fire-prevention distance from the parking lots of motor vehicles, a computer program was developed for the computer \u00c2\u00abAssessment of the safe distance from the boundaries of open areas of motor vehicles\u00c2\u00bb. Its practical application will significantly simplify the procedure associated with the assessment of compliance with fire safety requirements aimed at preventing the spread of fire from the parking lot of the motor vehicle to buildings and structures for industrial purposes and will allow to set the value of the safe fire distance between them. \u00c2\u00a9 2023, STC Industrial Safety CJSC.

      "abstract": "In the last few years, the multi-modal emotion recognition has become an important research issue in the affective computing community due to its wide range of applications that include mental disease diagnosis, human behavior understanding, human machine/robot interaction or autonomous driving systems. In this paper, we introduce a novel end-to-end multimodal emotion recognition methodology, based on audio and visual fusion designed to leverage the mutually complementary nature of features while maintaining the modality-specific information. The proposed method integrates spatial, channel and temporal attention mechanisms into a visual 3D convolutional neural network (3D-CNN) and temporal attention into an audio 2D convolutional neural network (2D-CNN) to capture the intra-modal features characteristics. Further, the inter-modal information is captured with the help of an audio-video (A-V) cross-attention fusion technique that effectively identifies salient relationships across the two modalities. Finally, by considering the semantic relations between the emotion categories, we design a novel classification loss based on an emotional metric constraint that guides the attention generation mechanisms. We demonstrate that by exploiting the relations between the emotion categories our method yields more discriminative embeddings, with more compact intra-class representations and increased inter-class separability. The experimental evaluation carried out on the RAVDESS (The Ryerson Audio-Visual Database of Emotional Speech and Song), and CREMA-D (Crowd-sourced Emotional Multimodal Actors Dataset) datasets validates the proposed methodology, which leads to average accuracy scores of 89.25% and 84.57%, respectively. In addition, when compared to state-of-the-art techniques, the proposed solution shows superior performances, with gains in accuracy ranging in the [1.72%, 11.25%] interval. \u00c2\u00a9 2023",

      "abstract": "Many unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV) host rolling shutter (RS) cameras, i.e., cameras where image rows are exposed at slightly different times. As the camera moves in the meantime, this causes inconsistencies in homologous ray intersections in the bundle adjustment, so correction models have been proposed to deal with the problem. This paper presents a series of test flights and simulations performed with different UAV platforms at varying speeds over terrain of various morphologies with the objective of investigating and possibly optimising how RS correction models perform under different conditions, in particular as far as block control is concerned. To this aim, three RS correction models have been applied in various combinations, decreasing the number of fixed ground control points (GCP) or exploiting GNSS-determined camera stations. From the experimental tests as well as from the simulations, four conclusions can be drawn: (a) RS affects primarily horizontal coordinates and varies notably from platform to platform; (b) if the ground control is dense enough, all correction models lead practically to the same mean error on checkpoints; however, some models may cause large errors in elevation if too few GCP are used; (c) in most cases, a specific correction model is not necessary since the affine deformation caused by RS can be adequately modelled by just applying the extended Fraser camera calibration model; (d) using GNSS-assisted block orientation, the number of necessary GCP is strongly reduced.",

      "abstract": "Forming a UAV cluster with multiple UAVs to collaborate in accomplishing tasks is the future development of battlefield. The UAV cluster can collaborate by communicating through inter-aircraft links and can quickly and accurately perform complex tasks such as path planning, collaborative reconnaissance, collaborative sensing and attack. In the process of Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) cooperative operation, obtaining the real-time attitude information of each UAV is preliminary to implement collaborative cooperation. However, in practice, due to the internal malfunction of sensors and mutual interference among UAVs, the acquired attitudes often suffer from data missing. This paper proposed a novel missing data reconstruction method for UAV's attitude in the case of sensor failures. The attitude data of UAV is obtained through an advanced UAV simulation platform AirSim. Through fusing the temporal convolutional network (TCN) and Bi-directional long short-term memory (Bi-LSTM), a deep regression framework is established for missing data construction. In addition, we evaluate the reliability of the proposed method by comparing with different baseline models and different combinations of data missing. The performance of our method is quantified using metrics of root-mean-square-error (RMSE), mean absolute error (MAE), determination coefficient (DC), mean absolute percentage error (MAPE), and symmetric mean absolute percentage error (SMAPE) score. The averaged performance values of our proposed method outperform other baseline algorithms. The results of the experiment show that the study could well-address the issue of missing data reconstruction and provide reliable attitude data. \u00c2\u00a9 2023 Elsevier B.V.",

      "abstract": "Road intersections represent the primary bottleneck in transportation systems and connected autonomous vehicles (CAVs) have the potential to aleviate the problem through communication and coordination. As such, this work proposes a novel framework where, accounting for CAVs' location uncertainty, an intersection manager (IM) controls CAVs approaching a road crossing so as to maximize the number of admitted vehicles, while ensuring a guaranteed (tunable) level of safety. To fully exploit the communication links among the IM and the CAVs, several features are included in the proposed framework: (i) periodic re-optimizations of the CAVs' applied controls; (ii) periodic re-ordering of the intersection crossing sequence; and (iii) event-based control and ordering optimizations to achieve the best possible trade-off between complexity and performance. The proposed framework is able to improve both the number of admitted CAVs to the intersection and the CAVs' average speeds as compared to relevant state-of-the-art solutions. Importantly, when event-triggering is applied, most of the benefits introduced by periodic optimizations are retained, while at the same time the number of re-optimizations required are reduced by 47.6% (34.18%) during average (heavy) traffic conditions. \u00c2\u00a9 2016 IEEE.",

Policy instruments in force, do not focus on cyber-threats, and the industry addresses relevant challenges, with recommendations and expertise from third parties. Moreover, increased digitization of operations, as well as the advent of marine autonomous surface ships (MASS), imply higher relevant risks and require new mitigation strategies. This work demonstrates that the prevailing definitions of seaworthiness do not suffice in the contemporary context of operations characterized by a high degree of automation. In this regard, the term cyber-seaworthiness is newly introduced and defined with the aim of addressing the identified gaps.

Moreover, sporadic misdetections are irrelevant since confidence on detections is typically averaged across consecutive frames, and detection devices (e.g. cameras, LiDARs) are often redundant, thus providing fault tolerance. This paper exploits such intrinsic fault tolerance of the CBOD process, and assesses in an automotive case study to what extent CBOD can tolerate approximation coming from multiple sources such as lower precision arithmetic, approximate arithmetic units, and even random faults due to, for instance, low voltage operation. We show that the accuracy impact of those sources of approximation is within 1% of the baseline even when considering the three approximate domains simultaneously, and hence, multiple sources of approximation can be exploited to build highly efficient accelerators for CBOD in cars. \u00c2\u00a9 2023 Elsevier B.V.",

      "abstract": "Object detection has achieved significant progress in attaining high-quality performance without leaking private messages. However, traditional approaches cannot defend the poisoning attacks. Poisoning attacks can make the predictive model unusable, which quickly causes recognition errors or even traffic accidents. In this paper, we propose a privacy-preserving object detection with poisoning recognition (PR-PPOD) framework via distributed training with the help of the CNN, ResNet18, and classical SSD network. Specifically, we design a poisoning model recognition algorithm to remove the uploaded local poisoning parameters to guarantee a trained model's availability based on given privacy-preserving progress. More importantly, the PR-PPOD framework can effectively prevent the threat of differential attacks and avoid privacy leakage caused by reverse model reasoning. Moreover, the effectiveness, efficiency, and security of PR-PPOD are demonstrated via comprehensive theoretical analysis. Finally, we simulate the performance of local poisoning model recognition based on the MNIST, CIFAR10, VOC2007, and VOC2012 datasets, which could achieve good performance compared with the case without poisoning recognition. \u00c2\u00a9 2013 IEEE.",

The modern flying ad-hoc network leverages the advanced low latency vehicular communication and intelligent computing paradigms that help the ecosystem to grow up to the next level. In this work, we propose an ecosystem for precision agriculture that leverages the use of the opportunistic MQTT protocol in an edge-enabled intelligent drone network for sensing and performing crop prediction using an intelligent ensemble machine learning model. The proposed approach leverages the edge computing system that requires low energy devices and also exploits the ultra-low latency opportunistic message transfer methodology. The experimental results show the maximum of 0.9 message delivery ratio and a minimum of 600 ms latency is achieved by opportunistic MQTT protocol in an ultra-low latency sparse network scenario. A weighted ensemble model is deployed onto the edge enabled devices or the drones. An accuracy of 96.5% is achieved in predicting the type of crops that can be grown in the soil about the selected area of interest. \u00c2\u00a9 2022 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.",

      "abstract": "Penguins display an utmost degree of adaptation to the marine environment as their water locomotion resembles flying, with their flippers demonstrating multimodal functionality. By multimodality of flipper action (two hydrodynamic modes\u2009+\u2009bipedal gait balance), we mean that flapping performance is dominant in certain periods and, in that case, Strouhal number is important. There are also periods when the steady (non-flapping) mode is dominant, i.e., the flipper acts as a fixed foil; hence both hydrodynamic modes are analysed in this study. Strouhal number from wing-beat frequency and swimming speed is derived across different penguin species, and the effect of flapping amplitude on the Strouhal number is studied. It is established that $$\\mathrm{St}$$ during aquatic flights for maximum cases falls within the theoretical range of higher propulsive efficiency (0.2\u2009&lt;\u2009Strouhal number\u2009&lt;\u20090.4), which gives us the confidence to consider penguin wings as an efficient flapping foil in the autonomous underwater vehicle. Moreover, the estimated buoyancy force at lower depth explains how penguin returns to the water surface capitalizing on the high buoyancy force while their wings act as a fixed foil and, that way generate beneficial lift. Then, a numerical analysis was performed to estimate the aerodynamic forces generated by the static penguin wing at a Reynolds number of 60,000 in order to understand its feasibility of application for Micro aerial vehicles. It was found that up to 10\u00b0 angle of attack, the standard NACA0012 profile shows a higher lift-to-drag, whereas at 15\u00b0 and 20\u00b0 angle of attack, as the penguin wing one is 122% and 60.62% higher than the NACA0012 aerofoil. Implementation of scaling the geometric features of penguins for wing design applications is also simulated and discussed.",

      "abstract": "To solve the hunting problem of multi-USVs (unmanned surface vehicles) on the sea, a multi-agent reinforcement learning hunting algorithm is proposed. Firstly, the environmental and kinematic model of the boundary-free hunting problem is established based on the background of the cooperative attack of USVs, and the criteria for successful hunting are given according to the requirements of rapidity and encirclement. Then, a Markov decision process framework is established based on the multi-agent PPO (MAPPO) algorithm. The state-space with scalability and permutation invariant, an action space with decoupling of capture distance and azimuth, and a reward function combining capture reward and step reward are designed. Finally, the framework of centralized training and distributed execution is adopted to train the policy. During the training, the skills of curriculum learning are used to make the network converge quickly, and the USVs share the same strategy and execute the action independently. Simulation shows that the proposed method has more advantages than other algorithms in the hunting success rate and timeliness under different testing conditions. In addition, when some of the USVs are failed, the remaining USVs can continue the task, which proves strong robustness and potential for deployment in a real environment. \u00c2\u00a9 2023 Northeast University.

      "abstract": "When teleoperating a multirobot system (MRS) in outdoor environments, human operators can often detect obstacles that are not detected by robots and spot emergencies faster than robots do. However, the lack of efficient methods for operators to manipulate an MRS has limited the number of robots in a human-robot team. To handle this problem, a distributed hierarchical shared control scheme is proposed, aiming to provide a safe and flexible control interface for a few human operators to interact with a large MRS. The proposed hierarchical control scheme employs a two-layered structure. In the upper layer, intention field networks are designed to generate virtual human control signals. Two functionalities for human teleoperation, called: 1) group management and 2) motion intervention, are realized using intention fields, allowing the operators to split the robot formation into different groups and steer individual robots away from immediate danger. In parallel, a blending-based shared control algorithm is designed in the lower layer to resolve the conflict between human intervention inputs and autonomous formation control signals. The input-to-output stability (IOS) of the proposed distributed hierarchical shared control scheme is proved by exploiting the properties of weighting functions. Results from a usability testing experiment and a physical experiment are also presented to validate the effectiveness and practicability of the proposed method. \u00c2\u00a9 2013 IEEE.",

      "abstract": "Pushbroom hyperspectral imaging (HSI) systems intrinsically measure our surroundings by leveraging 1D spatial imaging, where each pixel contains a unique spectrum of the observed materials. Spatial misregistration is an important property of HSI systems because it defines the spectral integrity of spatial pixels and requires characterization. The IEEE P4001 Standards Association committee has defined laboratory-based methods to test the ultimate limit of HSI systems but negates any impacts from mounting and flying the instruments on airborne platforms such as unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV\u2019s) or drones. Our study was designed to demonstrate a novel vicarious technique using convex mirrors to bridge the gap between laboratory and field-based HSI performance testing with a focus on extracting hyperspectral spatial misregistration. A fast and simple extraction technique is proposed for estimating the sampled Point Spread Function\u2019s width, along with keystone, as a function of wavelength for understanding the key contributors to hyperspectral spatial misregistration. With the ease of deploying convex mirrors, off-axis spatial misregistration is assessed and compared with on-axis behavior, where the best performance is often observed. In addition, convex mirrors provide an easy methodology to exploit ortho-rectification errors related to fixed pushbroom HSI systems, which we will show. The techniques discussed in this study are not limited to drone-based systems but can be easily applied to other airborne or satellite-based systems.",

      "abstract": "Cotton plays an essential role in global human life and economic development. However, diseases such as leaf blight pose a serious threat to cotton production. This study aims to advance the existing approach by identifying cotton blight infection and classifying its severity at a higher accuracy. We selected a cotton field in Shihezi, Xinjiang in China to acquire multispectral images with an unmanned airborne vehicle (UAV); then, fifty-three 50 cm by 50 cm ground framed plots were set with defined coordinates, and a photo of its cotton canopy was taken of each and converted to the L*a*b* color space as either a training or a validation sample; finally, these two kinds of images were processed and combined to establish a cotton blight infection inversion model. Results show that the Red, Rededge, and NIR bands of multispectral UAV images were found to be most sensitive to changes in cotton leaf color caused by blight infection; NDVI and GNDVI were verified to be able to infer cotton blight infection information from the UAV images, of which the model calibration accuracy was 84%. Then, the cotton blight infection status was spatially identified with four severity levels. Finally, a cotton blight inversion model was constructed and validated with ground framed photos to be able to explain about 86% of the total variance. Evidently, multispectral UAV images coupled with ground framed cotton canopy photos can improve cotton blight infection identification accuracy and severity classification, and therefore provide a more reliable approach to effectively monitoring such cotton disease damage.",

      "abstract": "Autonomous robots in the agri-food sector are increasing yearly, promoting the application of precision agriculture techniques. The same applies to online services and techniques implemented over the Internet, such as the Internet of Things (IoT) and cloud computing, which make big data, edge computing, and digital twins technologies possible. Developers of autonomous vehicles understand that autonomous robots for agriculture must take advantage of these techniques on the Internet to strengthen their usability. This integration can be achieved using different strategies, but existing tools can facilitate integration by providing benefits for developers and users. This study presents an architecture to integrate the different components of an autonomous robot that provides access to the cloud, taking advantage of the services provided regarding data storage, scalability, accessibility, data sharing, and data analytics. In addition, the study reveals the advantages of integrating new technologies into autonomous robots that can bring significant benefits to farmers. The architecture is based on the Robot Operating System (ROS), a collection of software applications for communication among subsystems, and FIWARE (Future Internet WARE), a framework of open-source components that accelerates the development of intelligent solutions. To validate and assess the proposed architecture, this study focuses on a specific example of an innovative weeding application with laser technology in agriculture. The robot controller is distributed into the robot hardware, which provides real-time functions, and the cloud, which provides access to online resources. Analyzing the resulting characteristics, such as transfer speed, latency, response and processing time, and response status based on requests, enabled positive assessment of the use of ROS and FIWARE for integrating autonomous robots and the Internet.",

The laser radar is exploited to incrementally build environmental maps so as to prevent the UAV from the threat of sudden obstacles. Meanwhile, by adding a vector field histogram, a temporary optimal target point is generated to make the UAV able to obtain a relatively optimal route. Furthermore, in order to prevent the UAV continuously trap into the local minimal points, a novel adaptive two-stage approach is constructed to adjust the step size and the probability of the target point. Finally, the effectiveness and feasibility of the proposed algorithm are verified in the simulation part. Compared with other algorithm, the proposed algorithm uses 31 iterations to obtain the optimal path of 61.529994 m and the planning time is just 0.32436 s.",

Exploiting the concept of shared energy tank, a passivity layer guarantees the passivity of the overall architecture with respect to destabilizing factors such as time delays in the communication channel. The desired behavior can then be freely designed in the transparency layer. The formulation of the energy tank is first revised, allowing a more efficient use of energy, and then extended, allowing explicitly the use of both admittance and impedance causality robots. A novel framework capable of combining the use of teleoperated and autonomous robots is proposed. The architecture has been tested and validated on a multiarms system in a realistic surgical scenario with the da Vinci research kit (dVRK) and an autonomous arm holding the endoscope. \u00c2\u00a9 1993-2012 IEEE.",

      "abstract": "The development of quantum computing systems poses a great threat to the security of existing public key-based systems. As a result, the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) started a Post-Quantum Cryptography (PQC) standardization project in 2015, and currently active research is being conducted to apply PQC to various cryptographic protocols. Unlike elliptic curve cryptography (ECC)-based schemes, PQC requires a large memory footprint and key/signature size. Therefore, when migrating PQC to a protocol, depending on the PQC and protocol specifications, it can be hard to migrate PQC. In the case of the WAVE protocol, it is difficult to satisfy the accuracy of a specific PQC algorithm because segmentation of the signature occurs during transmission due to the limitation of the maximum packet size. Therefore, in this paper, we present two methodologies that can apply PQC while complying with IEEE 1609.2 standards to the WAVE protocol in the V2V environment. Whereas previous migration studies have focused on designing a hybrid mode of protocols, this paper explores solutions more intuitively at the application layer of protocols. We analyzed two postquantum digital signature algorithms (Crystals-Dilithium and Falcon) and the structure of basic-safety messages (BSMs) of the V2V protocol on the size side. Through this, we propose methods that can perform an independent signature verification process without waiting for all divided signatures in the WAVE protocol. Our methodology overcomes the limitation that schemes with large signature sizes cannot be mounted into the WAVE protocol. We also note that the architecture used as an on-board unit (OBU) in an autonomous driving environment is mainly a microprocessor. We investigated an optimized PQC implementation in the OBU environment and simulated our methodology with the V2Verifier. Finally, we measured the accurate latency through simulation in Jetson Xavier, which is mainly used as an OBU in the V2V communication network.",

      "abstract": "This work presents a 4-year study carried out on the so-called Vaches Noires cliffs (VNCs), in Normandy, France, between April 2016 and January 2019. The VNCs are badlands facing the Channel sea, with Cretaceous to Jurassic formations. They are subject to strong erosion processes already described by former works. This study aims to gain greater insight into the erosion phenomena with the help of aerial surveys supported by geophysical imaging. For this purpose, Digital Elevation Models (DEMs) were established using photogrammetry applied to dozens of photos taken by an Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV). Electrical Resistivity Imaging (ERI) was implemented according to profiles that were both transverse and parallel to the coastline, (i) from the top to bottom of the cliffs, (ii) as well as at the toe of the crests and on the beach. The main outcome is a global methodology to properly perform these methods and to combine all the results in a 3D environment using free software. This methodology was validated according to a 1-year experiment based on the comparison of two DEMs, then extended to a 4-year diachronic approach. Moreover, volumes of eroded and deposited materials were assessed in specific, morphodynamic areas of the cliffs. The ERI results were used to carry out thickness assessments of the layers involved in the erosion process, and served to clarify the local geology; however, their interpretation remains limited by the lack of a priori information, and underlines the need to carry out inversion processes via a 3D approach in a particularly complex topography. In conclusion, this work provides effective tools to anticipate the risks that threaten coastal habitats and infrastructures, and represents a solid basis for further study.",

      "abstract": "Smallholder farmers in sub-Saharan Africa play a vital role in achieving food security and nutrition, yet they are often overlooked by development policies and lack access to the technology and information needed to increase their agricultural productivity. This is particularly true in Malawi, where smallholder farmers make up over 80% of the population and face a range of risks and challenges, including vulnerability to climate change, that threaten their livelihoods, food security, and nutrition. While drones and precision agriculture technology have had a significant impact on agriculture in high-income countries, their application by smallholder farmers in low-income countries is not well understood. This study, conducted in 2022, examines how drones can assist smallholder farmers in increasing their agricultural productivity and food security in Malawi. It explores how smallholders perceive the use of drones and the potential benefits and limitations of using drones in their farming operations. A unique aspect of this study aims to understand smallholders\u2019 perceptions of open data and data privacy. The results show that when smallholder farmers interact with drone data, they have a better understanding of their farm and are able to make more informed decisions that use fewer inputs and reduce production costs. Overall, this study demonstrates the potential for drones to assist smallholder farmers improve their on-farm knowledge, increase agricultural productivity, and mitigate the risks and challenges they face, leading to improved livelihoods and a more sustainable and secure food supply. Policymakers can promote the adoption of drone technology among smallholder farmers by developing policies that encourage public\u2013private partnerships to create affordable, locally adapted drone technologies and programs that meet their unique needs, while also ensuring responsible use of drones in agriculture through regulations that address concerns about data privacy and security.",

After some time, if the patient wants to share the healthcare records of one healthcare service provider with another, we can quickly exchange the healthcare record using our approaches. The challenges faced by healthcare service providers are healthcare record sharing, tampering, and insurance fraud. We have developed Health Record Chain for Sharing Medical Data using the modified SHA-512 algorithm. We have evaluated our methods, and our method outperforms in terms of storage cost and total time consumption for health record sharing. The proposed model takes 130 ms to share 100,000 records, 32 ms faster than traditional methods.

      "abstract": "The adoption of drones and other emerging digital technologies (DTs) has proven essential in revolutionizing humanitarian logistics as standalone solutions. However, the interoperability of humanitarian drones with other DTs has not yet been explored. In this study, we performed a systematic literature review to attempt to fill this gap by evaluating 101 mathematical models collected from Scopus. After conducting a descriptive analysis to identify the trends of publications in terms of year, type, source, and country of origin, a content analysis ensued to investigate the complementarity, interoperability, and level of integration of humanitarian drones with eight DTs. Next, we researched how these DTs can help drones exploit their capabilities to their full potential and facilitate the various drone operations deployed across different disaster scenarios, types, and stages. Last, the solving approaches employed by the models were examined. Overall, we shifted our research focus toward several overlooked aspects in the literature and identified multiple challenges needing to be addressed. Our work resulted in the formulation of a holistic framework aiming to standardize the cooperative utilization of DTs during the execution of humanitarian drone operations, so as to enhance their real-life application and scalability.",

      "abstract": "Coral reefs and their associated marine communities are increasingly threatened by anthropogenic climate change. A key step in the management of climate threats is an efficient and accurate end-to-end system of coral monitoring that can be generally applied to shallow water reefs. Here, we used RGB drone-based imagery and a deep learning algorithm to develop a system of classifying bleached and unbleached corals. Imagery was collected five times across one year, between November 2018 and November 2019, to assess coral bleaching and potential recovery around Lord Howe Island, Australia, using object-based image analysis. This training mask was used to develop a large training dataset, and an mRES-uNet architecture was chosen for automated segmentation. Unbleached coral classifications achieved a precision of 0.96, a recall of 0.92, and a Jaccard index of 0.89, while bleached corals achieved 0.28 precision, 0.58 recall, and a 0.23 Jaccard index score. Subsequently, methods were further refined by creating bleached coral objects (>16 pixels total) using the neural network classifications of bleached coral pixels, to minimize pixel error and count bleached coral colonies. This method achieved a prediction precision of 0.76 in imagery regions with >2000 bleached corals present, and 0.58 when run on an entire orthomosaic image. Bleached corals accounted for the largest percentage of the study area in September 2019 (6.98%), and were also significantly present in March (2.21%). Unbleached corals were the least dominant in March (28.24%), but generally accounted for ~50% of imagery across other months. Overall, we demonstrate that drone-based RGB imagery, combined with artificial intelligence, is an effective method of coral reef monitoring, providing accurate and high-resolution information on shallow reef environments in a cost-effective manner.",

      "abstract": "A drone is often called an \u00e2\u0080\u009dUnmanned Aerial Vehicle\u00e2\u0080\u009d or UAV. It is utilized in various civilian and military applications, including agriculture, surveillance, and delivery of packages. A promising idea for enhancing the safety and quality of drone flight is to build the Internet of Drones (IoD), in which drones are used to collect sensitive data, which is then communicated in real-time to external user (Ui) through the Ground Station Server (GSS). Before deployment, the GSS and all drones are registered with Control Room (CR), a central authority, which is a trusted authority. To ensure secure and reliable communications, an efficient and secure authentication scheme is needed to enable users and drones to authenticate each other and share a session key. Furthermore, because drones generally have small batteries and limited memory capacity, efficient and lightweight security techniques are suitable for them. Many schemes to secure IoD environments have been proposed recently; however, some were proven as insecure, and some degraded efficiency. In this work, we focus on developing a novel blockchain-based authentication scheme, called HCALA, on protecting the communication between an external user and drone utilizing Hyperelliptic Curve Cryptography (HECC). To evaluate the viability and efficacy of HCALA, We employ the extensively used Random Oracle Model (ROM) and formal security verification using a software tool called AVISPA, which is used to validate the internet security protocols. HCALA is also examined by utilizing informal security analysis techniques, demonstrating that the proposed protocol can withstand several well-known active and passive adversary attacks. It also shows that HCALA is more efficient regarding different parameters, according to the performance comparison. Compared to previous similar schemes, the security and functionality aspects are improved, and the computation, communication costs, and energy consumption are reduced. \u00c2\u00a9 2023 Elsevier B.V.",

      "abstract": "Bioinspired active camber morphing is an innovative solution for the aerodynamic performance enhancement of flight vehicles such as Micro Aerial Vehicles (MAVs) and Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs). In the present article, a bio-inspired Fish Bone Active Camber (FishBAC) corrugated rib design concept with and without a spine for an Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) is proposed. The wing model is composed of multiple corrugated ribs and a splitted spar for connecting each rib. The rib geometry is subjected to static structural analysis using ANSYS Finite Element Analysis (FEA) module under the unit load conditions. The deformation modes are first extracted from the solution of the wind tunnel test and the elastically deformed NACA 4412 profile will be used to perform Fluid-Structure Interaction (FSI) studies as a partly coupled analysis. FishBAC corrugated rib with spine design is a stable structure as inspired from nature species that can withstand elastic and inertial loads. Computational fluid dynamics (CFD) simulation is performed to compute the coefficient of lift (Cl), coefficient of drag (Cd) at different Angle of Attack (AoA) for a modified NACA 4412 airfoil and the pressure loads acting on the deformed shape is extracted. The Cl obtained for the modified airfoil at lower AoA is about 60\u201380% higher and the maximum Cl (Clmax) is 62% higher than the baseline airfoil. The Cd of modified airfoil is reduced about 20% at the AoA \u03b1\u2009=\u20093\u00b0 as compared with the baseline model. The proposed corrugated rib structure has been successfully 3D printed with Polylactic Acid plus (PLA+) material and the wind tunnel testing is done to validate the Cl, Cd values obtained through CFD simulations and the results are presented.",

      "abstract": "Protecting and enhancing forest carbon sinks is considered a natural solution for mitigating climate change. However, the increasing frequency, intensity, and duration of droughts due to climate change can threaten the stability and growth of existing forest carbon sinks. Extreme droughts weaken plant hydraulic systems, can lead to tree mortality events, and may reduce forest diversity, making forests more vulnerable to subsequent forest disturbances, such as forest fires or pest infestations. Although early warning metrics (EWMs) derived using satellite remote sensing data are now being tested for predicting post-drought plant physiological stress and mortality, applications of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) are yet to be explored extensively. Herein, we provide twenty-four prospective approaches classified into five categories: (i) physiological complexities, (ii) site-specific and confounding (abiotic) factors, (iii) interactions with biotic agents, (iv) forest carbon monitoring and optimization, and (v) technological and infrastructural developments, for adoption, future operationalization, and upscaling of UAV-based frameworks for EWM applications. These UAV considerations are paramount as they hold the potential to bridge the gap between field inventory and satellite remote sensing for assessing forest characteristics and their responses to drought conditions, identifying and prioritizing conservation needs of vulnerable and/or high-carbon-efficient tree species for efficient allocation of resources, and optimizing forest carbon management with climate change adaptation and mitigation practices in a timely and cost-effective manner.",

      "abstract": "In smart ocean, the Marine Internet of Things (M-IoT) is ubiquitously used for data acquisition, communication connections, task computation, and so on. However, high-efficient energy consumption and secure yet low-latency transmission is subject to IoT devices' computation capacity and transmit power limitation, as well as wireless communication's broadcast characteristics. In this paper, we investigate the secure computation offloading in M-IoT with the assistance of unmanned surface vehicles (USVs) subject to the eavesdropping attack. In particular, we consider a scenario in which USVs are firstly scheduled to set up a high-quality communication link to the high altitude platform (HAP) and then exploited to provide cooperative jamming for the communication security at the physical layer when the HAP is performing computation offloading. We jointly optimize the USVs' positions, the duration of data uploading, the workload offloaded by HAP, the HAP's transmission power, and each USV's jamming signal power to minimize the system-wise energy consumption for completing the total workloads under the latency constraint. Despite the non-convexity, we decompose the problem vertically into a top problem that optimizes the USVs' positions and a bottom problem that optimizes the other variables. The Polyblock outer Approximation and bisection Search based algorithm (PAS-Algorithm) is proposed to alternatively optimize the variables in the bottom problem. And the Code bAsed croSs Entropy algorithm (CASE-Algorithm) is proposed to obtain the suboptimal solution to the formulated joint optimization problem. Numerical results validate the accuracy and effectiveness of our algorithms as well as the performance of optimizing the total energy consumption compared with the benchmark algorithms. \u00c2\u00a9 1967-2012 IEEE.",

      "abstract": "The high dam is an important strategic infrastructure that supports the efficient development of hydropower and the comprehensive utilization of water resources. It continuously and stably provides energy supply and flood control guarantees for economic and social development, generating huge social and economic benefits. There are numerous high dam hubs in the southwest region, including several large and super-large high dam hubs such as the Baihetan, Xiluodu, Jinping First-stage, and Dagangshan. Large unit power generation, large flow flood discharge, and high-speed water flow energy dissipation have become the norm, and the destruction of flood discharge and energy dissipation buildings has become a common key threat to dam safety in high dam hub projects. Regular inspection of the overflow surface damage of flood discharge and energy dissipation structures during the operation period of hydropower hubs has become an important means to grasp their working performance and evaluate the safety status of the structure. With the innovation and development of equipment technology and information technology, relying on underwater robots to carry out intelligent damage detection of hydraulic structures in high dam hubs has become a trend. However, due to the complex and harsh detection conditions such as sandy water bodies and underwater sediment deposition in southwestern rivers, the coupling mechanism between high-speed water flow and flow surface damage is still unclear, and there is a lack of theoretical and technical methods for damage detection and evaluation. The contradiction between the large inspection scope, low inspection efficiency, and poor environmental adaptability also needs to be solved, and the efficiency of damage perception and identification still needs to be improved. There are still many difficulties in efficient and precise inspection and scientific comprehensive evaluation. In response to the significant demand for structural safety during the operation of flood discharge and energy dissipation buildings in the high dam hub, it is necessary to focus on solving three key scientific problems: 1) Damage formation mechanism and evolution law under the coupling effect of high-speed water flow and flow surface; 2) Adaptive inspection theory and methods suitable for complex environments; 3) Mechanism analysis and data-driven fusion of structural safety risk analysis and evaluation theory. The four important research aspects that need to be paid attention to in proposing the intelligent inspection and safety evaluation theory and method for flood discharge and energy dissipation buildings in high dam hubs are as follows: 1) Evolution mechanism of coupled damage on the flow surface under the action of high-speed water flow; 2) Multi-information cognitive mechanism and adaptive inspection methods in complex environments; 3) Intelligent identification and quantification methods for damage characteristics of flood discharge and energy dissipation structures; 4) Structural security analysis and evaluation system for multiple information fusion. Through in-depth research on the theory and methods of intelligent inspection and safety evaluation, this study reveals the formation mechanism and evolution law of damage to the overflow surface of flood discharge and energy dissipation buildings in the southwest mountainous and canyon areas. It breaks through the autonomous intelligent inspection method of flood discharge outlets and water cushion pond structures with strong adaptability in complex environments, develops key technologies for intelligent classification and quantification of damage based on multi-dimensional perception information, and constructs a structural safety analysis and evaluation model that integrates multiple data of \"inspection monitoring simulation\". Taking the Dagangshan Hydropower Station on the Dadu River as a typical case, the application verification of intelligent inspection methods and evaluation models was carried out to support the safe operation, maintenance, and intelligent control of key flood discharge and energy dissipation buildings in the Dagangshan Hydropower Station on the Dadu River Basin. The aim is to provide theoretical and technical methods for the operation safety, damage prevention, and control of high dams. The research results have significant scientific value and guiding significance in ensuring the safety of power generation in cascade hydropower stations and improving the refined management level of hydropower operation and maintenance. \u00c2\u00a9 2023 Editorial Department of Journal of Sichuan University.

      "abstract": "Model predictive control (MPC) has been widely applied to different aspects of autonomous driving, typically using nonlinear physically derived models for prediction. However, feedback control systems inherently correct for model errors, and thus in many applications it is sufficient to use a linear time-invariant (LTI) model for control design, especially when using robust control methods. This philosophy of approach appears to have been neglected in current driverless car research and is the research gap that we aim to address here. Namely, instead of deriving meticulous nonlinear physical models of vehicle dynamics and solving a correspondingly complex optimal control problem (OCP), we identify a low-order data-driven LTI model and handle its uncertainty via robust linear MPC methods. We develop a two-step control scheme for driverless cars based on tube MPC (TMPC), which introduces structural robustness, ensuring constraint compliance despite modeling error in the data-driven prediction model. Furthermore, we use fast optimization methods designed to exploit the special structure of the linear MPC problem. We evaluate the proposed control scheme using a vehicle model identified from real-world data and simulations in IPGCarmaker, where the model of the vehicle under control is inherently nonlinear and uses detailed 3-D physics. Our results show that an LTI model can be effectively used for the task of lane-keeping, that TMPC can prevent lane departure and possible collisions due to model uncertainty, and that linear models allow for several algorithmic improvements that can decrease computation time by an order of magnitude compared with naive MPC implementations. \u00c2\u00a9 1993-2012 IEEE.",

      "abstract": "Dolphin signals are effective carriers for underwater covert detection and communication. However, the environmental and cost constraints terribly limit the amount of data available in dolphin signal datasets are often limited. Meanwhile, due to the low computational power and resource sensitivity of Unmanned Underwater Vehicles (UUVs), current methods for real-time generation of dolphin signals with favorable results are still subject to several challenges. To this end, a Masked AutoEncoder Generative Adversarial Network (MAE-GAN) model is hereby proposed. First, considering the few-shot condition, the dataset is extended by using data augmentation techniques. Then, to meet the low arithmetic constraint, a denoising autoencoder with a mask is used to obtain latent codes through self-supervised learning. These latent codes are then utilized in Conditional Wasserstein Generative Adversarial Network-Gradient Penalty (CWGAN-GP) to generate a whistle signal model for the target dataset, fully demonstrating the effectiveness of the proposed method for enhancing dolphin signal generation in data-limited scenarios. The whistle signals generated by the MAE-GAN and baseline models are compared with actual dolphin signals, and the findings indicate that the proposed approach achieves a discriminative score of 0.074, which is 28.8% higher than that of the current state-of-the-art techniques. Furthermore, it requires only 30.2% of the computational resources of the baseline model. Overall, this paper presents a novel approach to generating high-quality dolphin signals in data-limited situations, which can also be deployed on low-resource devices. The proposed MAE-GAN methods provide a promising solution to address the challenges of limited data and computational power in generating dolphin signals.",

      "abstract": "With an increase in the number of devices in the edge layer connected to the fog server of the fog computing environment, it is found that vulnerable and unauthorized activities are also increasing relatively. Thus, there is a requirement for authorized access control in such an environment that is governed by secured and efficient key management between the communicating devices. Many researchers have presented conventional solutions for key management depending on a third party. The third party operated for a key generation or key distribution in a fog computing environment based on a centralized architecture which leads to the drawbacks like a single-point failure and inconsistency of key management. So, effective and secured key management between the edge devices which are willing to communicate is the major concern to be addressed in the current digital world to achieve access control. This paper proposes a BSKM-FC (Blockchain-based Secured Key Management in a Fog Computing Environment) which is a decentralized system in a fog computing environment without using a third party. The BSKM-FC makes use of a one-way hash chain for the generation of private and public key pairs and ECC (Elliptic Curve Cryptography) for secured sharing. Upon successful authentication, the session key generation at both edge devices is based on the key pair provided by the fog server and stored securely in the blockchain. The BSKM-FC system uses private blockchain technology in the fog layer to provide secured storage and management. The work is implemented in the Truffle Blockchain and found that BSKM-FC performs better in terms of overall block preparation time. The security analysis of the proposed scheme is carried out based on the ROR model and also verified using AVISPA for some known attacks. Informal security analysis of the proposed work is performed by considering some of the known attacks where we observe that the proposed scheme overcomes such attacks. Performance overhead analysis is demonstrated using MIRACL considering computation cost, communication cost, and storage cost. The results show that the proposed scheme meets security requirements and performs effectively. The computation overhead, communication overhead, storage overhead, and block preparation time of the proposed scheme were improved by 7% to 14%, 9% to 18%, 7% to 17%, and 14% to 28%, respectively, as compared to existing schemes. \u00c2\u00a9 2023 Elsevier B.V.",

      "abstract": "Adversarial robustness has attracted extensive studies in various fields by increasing the interpretability of deep learning and enhancing the understanding of neural network models. In realistic scenarios such as UAV control system, imbalanced datasets are a consensus. Therefore, how to solve the adversarial robustness on imbalanced datasets is a more and more inescapable problem in UAV control system. There have been some works on adversarial robustness on imbalanced datasets, which bring us a deeper understanding of vulnerability of deep neural networks and the generation of adversarial examples. To adjust the classification plane after training, the long-tailed robustness framework is usually designed to be multi-stage, and different classifiers are used in different stages, which can improve the robustness through multi learning. The existing methods are hardly considered to effectively handle the long-tailed robustness problem in UAV control system. To explore the intrinsic features of long-tailed robustness, we propose a one-stage robustness framework. First, we study different classifiers and propose a general cosine classifier. By changing the general cosine classifier adaptively, the model obtains a more robust classification. Then, we analyze the scalability of the focal loss and design a focal-margin loss. Finally, we design a category focus mobile learning strategy, obtained more robust features by changing the learning emphasis with this strategy. From this, we design a simple and efficient one-stage dynamic adversarial robustness method DRL under long-tailed distribution, which consists of an adaptive cosine classifier and a focal-margin loss under long-tailed mobile learning. The extended experiments demonstrate the superiority of our approach over other state-of-the-art methods, and the effectiveness of the designed module. This method can effectively solve the long-tailed robustness problem on UAV control system and other terminals. \u00c2\u00a9 2023 Elsevier B.V.",

      "abstract": "Object detection is a classic image processing problem. For instance, in autonomous driving applications, targets such as cars and pedestrians are detected in the road scene video. Many image-based object detection methods utilizing hand-crafted features have been proposed. Recently, more research has adopted a deep learning approach. Object detectors rely on useful features, such as the object\u2019s boundary, which are extracted via analyzing the image pixels. However, the images captured, for instance, in an outdoor environment, may be degraded due to bad weather such as haze and fog. One possible remedy is to recover the image radiance through the use of a pre-processing method such as image dehazing. We propose a dehazing model for image enhancement. The framework was based on the conditional generative adversarial network (cGAN). Our proposed model was improved with two modifications. Various image dehazing datasets were employed for comparative analysis. Our proposed model outperformed other hand-crafted and deep learning-based image dehazing methods by 2dB or more in PSNR. Moreover, we utilized the dehazed images for target detection using the object detector YOLO. In the experimentations, images were degraded by two weather conditions\u2014rain and fog. We demonstrated that the objects detected in images enhanced by our proposed dehazing model were significantly improved over those detected in the degraded images.",

      "abstract": "When it comes to forest management and protection, knowledge is key. Therefore, forest mapping is crucial to obtain the required knowledge towards profitable resource exploitation and increased resilience against wildfires. Within this context, this paper presents a literature review on tree classification and segmentation using data acquired by unmanned aerial vehicles, with special focus on the last decade (2013\u20132023). The latest research trends in this field are presented and analyzed in two main vectors, namely: (1) data, where used sensors and data structures are resumed; and (2) methods, where remote sensing and data analysis methods are described, with particular focus on machine learning approaches. The study and review methodology filtered 979 papers, which were then screened, resulting in the 144 works included in this paper. These are systematically analyzed and organized by year, keywords, purpose, sensors, and methods used, easily allowing the readers to have a wide, but at the same time detailed, view of the latest trends in automatic tree classification and segmentation using unmanned aerial vehicles. This review shows that image processing and machine learning techniques applied to forestry and segmentation and classification tasks are focused on improving the accuracy and interpretability of the results by using multi-modal data, 3D information, and AI methods. Most works use RGB or multispectral cameras, or LiDAR scanners, individually. Classification is mostly carried out using supervised methods, while segmentation mostly uses unsupervised machine learning techniques.",

      "abstract": "Context. The Low Frequency Array (LOFAR) is the only existing radio interferometer able to observe at ultra-low frequencies (<100 MHz) with high resolution (<15\") and high sensitivity (<1 mJy beam-1). To exploit these capabilities, the LOFAR Surveys Key Science Project is using the LOFAR Low Band Antenna (LBA) to carry out a sensitive wide-area survey at 41-66 MHz named the LOFAR LBA Sky Survey (LoLSS). Aims. LoLSS is covering the whole northern sky above declination 24 with a resolution of 15\"and a sensitivity of 1-2 mJy beam-1 (1\u00cf\u0083) depending on declination, field properties, and observing conditions. Here we present the first data release, including a discussion of the calibration strategy and the properties of the released images and catalogues. Methods. A fully automated pipeline was used to reduce the 95 fields included in this data release. The data reduction procedures developed for this project have a general application and are currently being used to process almost all LOFAR LBA interferometric observations. Compared to the preliminary release, direction-dependent errors have been derived and corrected for during the calibration process. This results in a typical sensitivity of 1.55 mJy beam-1, which is four times better than for the preliminary release, at the target resolution of 15\". Results. The first data release of the LOFAR LBA Sky Survey covers 650 deg2 in the HETDEX spring field. The resultant data products released to the community include mosaic images (I and V Stokes) of the region, and a catalogue of 42 463 detected sources and related Gaussian components used to describe the sources' morphologies. Separate catalogues for the six in-band frequencies of 44, 48, 52, 56, 60, and 64 MHz are also released. Conclusions. The first data release of LoLSS shows that, despite the influences of the ionosphere and radio frequency interference, LOFAR can conduct large-scale surveys in the frequency window 42-66 MHz with unprecedentedly high sensitivity and resolution. The data can be used to derive unique information on the low-frequency spectral properties of many thousands of sources with a wide range of applications in extragalactic and galactic astronomy. \u00c2\u00a9 2023 EDP Sciences.

      "abstract": "Wearable devices-based biometrics has become mainstream in the biometric domain, especially in mobile computing, due to its convenience, flexibility, and potentially high user acceptance. Among various modalities, wearable devices-based gait recognition has been recognized as an effective user authentication method and employed in various applications, such as automated entry systems for home, school, work, vehicles, and automated ticket payment/validation for public transport. However, how secure wearable gait remains an open research question. In this study, we conduct a comprehensive security analysis of the wearable gait. Then, we demonstrate that gait itself is not robust against some attacking methods, such as spoofing or forgery. Therefore, we argue that an anti-spoofing mechanism is important for enhancing the security of wearable gait biometric systems. To this end, we proposed a novel authentication protocol called Pistis that embedded gait biometrics and a liveness detection mechanism that is aiming to detect various attacks of gait authentication systems. Our extensive experiments based on 50 subjects demonstrate that Pistis is effective in liveness detection and authentication performance enhancement, providing 100% accuracy for human and nonhuman detection, and 99.53% accuracy for user authentication. Pistis can be used as a liveness detection method for wearable devices-based biometrics, significantly for wearable gait. \u00c2\u00a9 2023 IEEE.",

      "abstract": "Cybercriminals are always developing innovative strategies to confound and frustrate their victims. Therefore, maintaining constant vigilance is essential if one wishes to protect the availability, confidentiality, and integrity of digital systems. Machine learning (ML) is becoming an increasingly powerful technique for doing intelligent cyber analysis, which enables proactive defenses. Machine learning (ML) has the potential to thwart future assaults by studying the recurring patterns that have already been successful. Nevertheless, there are two significant drawbacks associated with the utilization of ML in security analysis. To begin, the most advanced machine learning systems have significant problems with their computing overheads. Because of this constraint, firms are unable to completely embrace ML-based cyber strategies. Second, in order for security analysts to make advantage of ML for a wide variety of applications, they will need to develop specialized frameworks. In this study, we aim to put a numerical value on the degree to which a hub can improve the safety of an ecosystem. Typical cyberattacks were carried out on an Internet of Things (IoT) network located within a smart house in order to validate the hub. Further investigation of the intrusion detection system's (IDS) resistance to adversarial machine learning (AML) assaults was carried out. In this method, models can be attacked by supplying adversarial samples that attempt to take advantage of the defects in the detector that are present in the pre-trained model.",

      "abstract": "Connected automated vehicles (CAVs) serve as a promising enabler for future intelligent transportation systems because of their capabilities in improving traffic efficiency and driving safety, and reducing fuel consumption and vehicle emissions. A fundamental issue in CAVs is platooning control that empowers a convoy of CAVs to be cooperatively maneuvered with desired longitudinal spacings and identical velocities on roads. This paper addresses the issue of resilient and safe platooning control of CAVs subject to intermittent denial-of-service (DoS) attacks that disrupt vehicle-to-vehicle communications. First, a heterogeneous and uncertain vehicle longitudinal dynamic model is presented to accommodate a variety of uncertainties, including diverse vehicle masses and engine inertial delays, unknown and nonlinear resistance forces, and a dynamic platoon leader. Then, a resilient and safe distributed longitudinal platooning control law is constructed with an aim to preserve simultaneous individual vehicle stability, attack resilience, platoon safety and scalability. Furthermore, a numerically efficient offline design algorithm for determining the desired platoon control law is developed, under which the platoon resilience against DoS attacks can be maximized but the anticipated stability, safety and scalability requirements remain preserved. Finally, extensive numerical experiments are provided to substantiate the efficacy of the proposed platooning method. \u00c2\u00a9 2014 Chinese Association of Automation.",

      "abstract": "Background and Objective: Novel advances in machine learning (ML) and its subfield, deep learning (DL), as well as the recent release of large-scale electrocardiogram (ECG) databases, have driven a sharp increase in research related to automated ECG interpretation. This review aims to summarize the recent ML approaches for automatically interpreting standard 12-lead ECG signals. Methods: We searched 10 indexing databases, for original research in English, referring to the application of ML/DL techniques in 12-lead, raw ECG signal analysis. The retrieved titles were filtered based on their relevance. The results were summarized and reported. Key Content and Findings: More than 80% of studies integrated a DL approach, while fewer attempts applied a feature extraction method to obtain inputs for training a simple ML classifier. The average diagnostic accuracy was as high as 90%, while several other performance metrics, such as the area under the curve (AUC), F1-score, sensitivity and specificity, were also employed. DL models generally demanded 10-time more samples for training but were capable of better handling multi-class problems. The most frequently involved disease (49% of studies) was myocardial infarction (MI), while atrial fibrillation (AF) was encountered in more than one-third of studies. Various datasets were used for training and testing, constituting either private collections or publicly available databanks [such as the \u00e2\u0080\u009cPhysikalisch-Technische Bundesanstalt\u00e2\u0080\u009d (PTB) dataset and datasets derived from the \u00e2\u0080\u009cChina Physiological Signal Challenge\u00e2\u0080\u009d and the \u00e2\u0080\u009cComputing in Cardiology Challenge\u00e2\u0080\u009d]. Overall, DL and simpler ML approaches for automated ECG interpretation display unprecedented growth, reaching remarkably high performances. Conclusions: While such novel tools can support clinicians in reaching reliable diagnoses for life-threatening conditions on the spot, concerns regarding their accountability do exist. Generalizability of the developed approaches is still an issue, possibly mitigable with the extensive deployment of developed models, so as to become massively accessible and validatable. Finally, the observed heterogeneity of the various attempts underlines the need for transparency and reproducibility in the development processes. \u00c2\u00a9 Journal of Medical Artificial Intelligence.

However, as the scale of the connected nodes continues to grow, their heterogeneity and cybersecurity threats are more eminent, and conventional centralized communications and decision-making methodology are reaching their limit. This article is the first exploration of a trustworthy and fault-tolerant framework for C-CAS for achieving hyperreliable global decision making in a trustless environment, where the connected sensors/nodes are less reliable due to either communication failure or local decision error (e.g., by sensing algorithm/AI, etc.). The proposed framework is based on two iconic distributed consensus (DC) mechanisms: 1) practical Byzantine fault tolerance (PBFT) and 2) Raft, under the proposed perception-initiative-consensus-action (PICA) protocol with wireless connections among the nodes. We first analytically derived consensus reliability in six different system models. The other fundamental performance metrics, such as the consensus throughput and latency, node scalability, and reliability gain are also analytically derived. These analytical results provide basic design guidelines for wireless DC (WDC) usage in the C-CAS systems. The results show that WDC significantly improves overall system reliability with the increasing number of participating nodes. \u00c2\u00a9 2023 IEEE.",

      "abstract": "Digital transformation has unveiled new prospects for increased performance and productivity in the agricultural sector to meet rising food security needs. Continuous industrialization and unexpected disruptions (e.g., workforce mobility restrictions due to the COVID-19 pandemic) call for the adoption of agricultural robots. However, automated solutions could be associated with societal challenges in rural areas; unemployment growth has been perceived as a major threat that jeopardizes societal welfare, potentially hindering the implementation of digital technologies. In this context, human\u00e2\u0080\u0093robot synergistic systems could act as a promising socially viable alternative. Through systems thinking, this research investigates the complex interconnections and key feedback mechanisms of automation diffusion (conventional and human\u00e2\u0080\u0093robot interactive) under the socio-economic perceptions (drivers and barriers) of agribusinesses and rural communities. Overall, this study contributes towards eliciting the mental models that underpin the transition from agricultural robots to human\u00e2\u0080\u0093robot collaboration by transforming automation-related societal risks into opportunities for sustainable rural development. \u00c2\u00a9 2022 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.",

      "abstract": "This article investigates the fault detection problem of unmanned marine vehicles (UMVs) under the influence caused by replay attacks. First, the dynamics of UMV are modeled by a Takagi - Sugeno (T - S) fuzzy system with an unknown membership function, which includes the nonlinear coupling of the internal state of the system, the environmental multisource disturbance as well as the potential thruster failure on UMV. Then, the possible replay attack from the sensor to the shore-based center is considered, and a switching-type attack tolerant fault detection filter is designed. Sufficient conditions are given to ensure that the filtering augmented system is stable and with stochastic finite frequency H\u00e2\u0088\u009e and H- performances, which reflect the robustness to the disturbance and sensitivity to the fault. On this basis, through a series of mathematical processing, the linear solvable conditions for the design of fault detection filters are obtained. Finally, the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm is verified by simulations. \u00c2\u00a9 1993-2012 IEEE.",

      "abstract": "[Background] Unpaved roads, widespread in the hilly and gully of Loess Plateau, China, have been suffering from severe soil erosion, adversely impacting the traffic and transportation as well as threatening socio-economic development. However, little was known about the spatial development and underlying mechanisms of unpaved road erosion, largely constraining the control of road erosion. [Methods] Using various methods such as unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) light detection and ranging (LiDAR), UAV photogrammetry and field survey, this study investigated the morphological pattern of unpaved road erosion in a small catchment (Qiaogou) of the hilly and gully Loess Plateau and explored the relationship between road erosion intensity (E) and associated impacting factors. Road erosion models were then established and validated using the field data from another catchment (Yangou catchment) in the hilly and gully Loess Plateau. [Results] 1) The slope gradient of each road segment and gullies decreased significantly (P < 0. 05), while the ratio of width to depth and density of gullies as well as erosion intensity did not change significantly (P > 0. 05) from the head to the outlet of the Qiaogou catchment. 2) The major influencing factors of unpaved road erosion were catchment area (R2 = 0. 60, P <0.01) and slope gradient of road segment (R2 = 0.54, P <0.01), followed by road segment length (R2 =0. 20, P <0. 05), and visible-band difference vegetation index (R2 =0. 01, P <0. 67) and slope gradient of drainage area (R2 =0. 02, P =0. 53) were of the least influence. 3) The road erosion intensity model was constructed based on individual road segment slope (Gr) and drainage area (Ac) factors as well as their combination respectively. The developed models were expressed as E =0. 87Ac + 77 759. 67 (R2 = 0. 60, P < 0. 01), E = 8 707. 23Gr - 49 252. 46 (R2 = 0. 54, P < 0. 01) and E = - 0. 56Ac + 5 783. 06Gr - 11 748. 78 (R2 = 0. 80, P < 0. 01). The accuracy of the road segment slope model was verified using the available road erosion measurements in the Yangou catchment to be satisfactory (R2 =0. 92, P <0. 01), demonstrating the applicability of the established models in the hilly and gully Loess Plateau. [Conclusions] The achieved results enhanced current understanding on the processes and mechanisms of unpaved road erosion and provided a useful reference for the prediction and control of road erosion on the Chinese Loess Plateau. \u00c2\u00a9 2023, Editorial Board of Science of Soil and Water Conservation.

It took number of years to come to the present stage, where in feature there will be much more improvements in this field of study. In this paper we concentrated on the data and communication network security, as one frequency data transfer is done to the ground control. We even concentrated on signal jamming system and hacking technologies adopted by the opponents for data theft and obstacles creation in signal transformation. The Unmanned Aerial Vehicles are classified based on the characteristics such as embedded mechanism, power consumption, user capabilities and based on operating environment. We focused on embedded mechanism related to sensors, camera and the different network protocols that provide data security. We discussed regarding different secured communication protocols and encryption technologies such as identity-based encryption. We even focused on the security communication between UAV to UAV for the data security and to protect the data from GPS Jamming and Spoofing. The UAV routing protocols are topology based and geographical position-based routing protocols. We conversed different attacking methods that can be adopted by the intruders. The Micro Air Vehicle Link communication protocol is utilized to control and secure a very high range frequency radio waves for UAV communication with the base station. We proposed a framework of secured wireless sensor network communication among a group of unmanned aerial systems and ground-based control system. \u00c2\u00a9 2023 Author(s).",

      "abstract": "<p><strong class=\"journal-contentHeaderColor\">Abstract.</strong> The Smart City concept is taking momentum recently as big metropolises as well as mid-size cities are intensifying their efforts to improve the life of people living in dense urban environment. Local governments are eager to have up-to-date information of every aspect of city life, including environmental data, such as air and water quality parameters; mobility data, such as traffic flow, including vehicles, transit passengers; crowd control, such as public events, mobility in hospitals; life quality data, such as social status, education level, health records; etc. Monitoring all these very different data streams in space and time is a formidable challenge. While on the data acquisition side, tremendous progress has been achieved, as sensors have been deployed in increasingly large numbers on both mobile and static platforms, there is a lack of creating accurate geotags, as the quality of georeferencing varies over a large scale. It is important to note that the data acquisition is becoming largely customer-based, as smart devices are efficient sensor systems and with advancing communication technologies, crowdsourcing is quickly becoming the dominant data source on mobile platforms. In this paper, we investigate the potential to exploit the ranging capabilities of imaging and communication sensors and use the strength of the spatial network formed by the sensors to improve the georeferencing of a group of platforms operating in a close environment, such as UAS swarm or a platoon of autonomous vehicles. Transportation in cities and in general mobility are of great interest to Smart Cities, they represent one of the most significant components of the activities, so having an optimized transportation system is essential to reduce carbon footprint, decrease commute time, and just improve the quality of life. To assess the performance of collaborative navigation based accurate georeferencing, data was acquired at a simulated intersection area at The Ohio State University, where multiple vehicles, pedestrians and cyclists were moving around. In addition, drones were flying above the area. Here we report about our initial results.</p>",

      "abstract": "Socially assistive robots have the potential to augment and enhance therapist\u2019s effectiveness in repetitive tasks such as cognitive therapies. However, their contribution has generally been limited as domain experts have not been fully involved in the entire pipeline of the design process as well as in the automatisation of the robots\u2019 behaviour. In this article, we present aCtive leARning agEnt aSsiStive bEhaviouR (CARESSER), a novel framework that actively learns robotic assistive behaviour by leveraging the therapist\u2019s expertise (knowledge-driven approach) and their demonstrations (data-driven approach). By exploiting that hybrid approach, the presented method enables in situ fast learning, in a fully autonomous fashion, of personalised patient-specific policies. With the purpose of evaluating our framework, we conducted two user studies in a daily care centre in which older adults affected by mild dementia and mild cognitive impairment (N&nbsp;=&nbsp;22) were requested to solve cognitive exercises with the support of a therapist and later on of a robot endowed with CARESSER. Results showed that: (i) the robot managed to keep the patients\u2019 performance stable during the sessions even more so than the therapist; (ii) the assistance offered by the robot during the sessions eventually matched the therapist\u2019s preferences. We conclude that CARESSER, with its stakeholder-centric design, can pave the way to new AI approaches that learn by leveraging human\u2013human interactions along with human expertise, which has the benefits of speeding up the learning process, eliminating the need for the design of complex reward functions, and finally avoiding undesired states.",

      "abstract": "Intelligent Transportation System (ITS) is continuously evolving alongside communication technologies and autonomous driving, giving way to new applications and services. Considering the significant rise in traffic casualties, protecting vulnerable road users (VRU), such as pedestrians, cyclists, motorcycles, animals, etc., has become ever more critical. That said, technological advances alone can not meet the requirements of such crucial applications. Therefore, combining them with architectural revolutions, particularly cloud, fog, and edge computing, is essential. In this review, we scrutinize the VRU safety application with regard to technological evolution. This review establishes the foundations for designing resilient, more reliable, end-to-end VRU protection services. It illustrates the possibility of combining the performance of different technologies through exploiting 5G architectural advantages (function placement, direct/indirect communication, etc.) for the intended application. In the context of 5G architecture, collision avoidance systems consider network and application-related challenges and solutions. This survey provides standardization, studies, and project efforts related to the use case and considers the different types of messages in the V2VRU communication-based safety application. We investigate how adapting the application parameters to the network state and devices\u2019 available resources can use network resources efficiently and provide reliable services.",

      "abstract": "The precise point positioning (PPP)-based real-time-kinematic (RTK) method attracts increasing attention from both academia and industry because of its potential for high accuracy positioning with a shorter convergence time compared to the traditional PPP. Besides high accuracy, integrity monitoring (IM) is indispensable for safety\u2013critical real-time land vehicle and aviation applications. As the traditional advanced receiver autonomous integrity monitoring (ARAIM) method is designed for (smoothed) pseudorange-based positioning, the complexity of multi-frequency multi-constellation PPP-RTK using carrier phase measurements has not been given sufficient consideration. This study proposes an IM scheme for multi-frequency multi-constellation uncombined PPP-RTK applying the ARAIM theory, with a new comprehensive threat model to accommodate not only pseudorange measurements, but also carrier phase measurements, and other fault events arising from the network corrections that support PPP-RTK. Characteristics of different types of faults are analyzed with the aid of numerical experiments. In addition, the impact of ambiguity-fixed solutions on PPP-RTK integrity performance is investigated. The authors have also conducted case studies, including static and real-kinematic positioning experiments. Experiments have demonstrated that fast convergence in accuracy and the position error bounds, or protection levels, with a given integrity risk, in horizontal position components of PPP-RTK could be achieved. For the open sky environments on a highway, the protection levels estimated by PPP-RTK solutions have the potential to meet the alert limit requirement for road transportation using ambiguity-fixed PPP-RTK positioning under the assumption that the risks of wrong ambiguity fixing are very small and can be ignored.",

Increasing the system\u2019s autonomous robustness to a variety of postural threats during locomotion is the key despite the need to evaluate noisy sensor signals. The equations of motion are the foundation of all published approaches. In contrast, we propose a more adequate evaluation of the equations of motion with respect to an arbitrary moving reference point in a non-inertial reference frame. Conceptual advantages are, e.g., getting independent of global position and velocity vectors estimated by sensor fusions or calculating the imaginary zero-moment point walking on different inclined ground surfaces. Further, we improve the calculation results by reducing noise-amplifying methods in our algorithm and using specific characteristics of physical robots. We use simulation results to compare our algorithm with established approaches and test it with experimental robot data.",

      "abstract": "Android applications are extremely popular, as they are widely used for banking, social media, e-commerce, etc. Such applications typically leverage a series of Permissions, which serve as a convenient abstraction for mediating access to security-sensitive functionality within the Android Ecosystem, e.g., sending data over the Internet. However, several malicious applications have recently deployed attacks such as data leaks and spurious credit card charges by abusing the Permissions granted initially to them by unaware users in good faith. To alleviate this pressing concern, we present DyPolDroid, a dynamic and semi-automated security framework that builds upon Android Enterprise, a device-management framework for organizations, to allow for users and administrators to design and enforce so-called Counter-Policies, a convenient user-friendly abstraction to restrict the sets of Permissions granted to potential malicious applications, thus effectively protecting against serious attacks without requiring advanced security and technical expertise. Additionally, as a part of our experimental procedures, we introduce Laverna, a fully operational application that uses permissions to provide benign functionality at the same time it also abuses them for malicious purposes. To fully support the reproducibility of our results, and to encourage future work, the source code of both DyPolDroid and Laverna is publicly available as open-source.",

      "abstract": "The rocky ledge on steep, high slopes easily tends to instability under the action of gravity, earthquake, excavation unloading, etc., which threatens the safety of the constructors and water conservancy and hydropower engineering. The early investigation of rocky ledge is of great significance. Due to large areas of slopes and inconvenient traffic, manual investigation is time-consuming and dangerous. A rapid identification method for rock ledge is proposed based on unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) photogrammetry. This method consists of generating the point cloud model of the slope by UAV photogrammetry, segmenting the point cloud model by kernel density estimation, clustering the point cloud by the density-based spatial clustering of applications with noise, and classifying the point clusters representing rocky ledges by the geometric feature. The slope near the Lianghekou hydropower station is used to study. The results show that the method can rapidly identify the rocky ledge on the whole slope scale, which reduces the risk and improves efficiency.",

      "abstract": "The general awareness of the threats on biodiversity and water quality raised the number of studies that use phytoplankton in assessment procedures. Since most metrics require obtaining mean values, this paper presents data that may help speed up field work and find indicators for a rapid water quality assessment based on single samplings, allowing simultaneous work on many sites. The phytoplankton from 43 Bulgarian waterbodies collected during three summer campaigns (2018, 2019, 2021) at sites selected after drone observations was studied by conventional light microscopy (LM) and an HPLC analysis of marker pigments. Our results allowed us to recommend drones and the HPLC application as reliable methods in rapid water quality assessments. In total, 787 algae from seven phyla (53 alien, new for Bulgaria) were identified. Chlorophyta was the taxonomically richest group, but Cyanoprokaryota dominated the biomass in most sites. New PCR data obtained on anatoxin and microcystin producers confirmed the genetic diversity of Cuspidothrix and Microcystis and provided three new species for the country\u2019s toxic species, first identified by LM. A statistical analysis revealed significant correlations of certain algal phyla and classes with different environmental variables, and their species are considered promising for future search of bioindicators. This is especially valid for the class Eustigmatophyceae, which, as of yet, has been almost neglected in water assessment procedures and indices.",

      "abstract": "Unmanned aerial vehicles are increasingly being applied to various applications for a variety purposes, such as delivery, communication relay, mapping, and surveillance services. Through these, it is possible to provide flexible and stable network services. Unmanned aerial vehicles perform a wide range of tasks using Internet-of-Things technology, which needs Internet access. These internet connections, however, make it more possible for attackers to execute various security attacks on unmanned aerial vehicles. Therefore, it is crucial to identify the attack behavior of the adversary, which is called \u201ccourse-of-action\u201d, to preserve security in the unmanned aerial vehicle infrastructure. Based on learned data, the existing course-of-action method has the drawback of not functioning on various networks. As a result, in this paper, we propose a novel heuristic search-based algorithm to apply to various unmanned aerial vehicle infrastructures. The algorithm can build the optimal heuristic functions in various unmanned aerial vehicle network environments to explore the attack course-of-action and design the optimal attack paths to maximize total reward. Applying the proposed algorithm in two unmanned aerial vehicle network scenarios allowed us to confirm that the best attack path is well established.",

      "abstract": "Machine learning (ML) methods such as artificial neural networks are rapidly becoming ubiquitous in modern science, technology, and industry. Despite their accuracy and sophistication, neural networks can be easily fooled by carefully designed malicious inputs known as adversarial attacks. While such vulnerabilities remain a serious challenge for classical neural networks, the extent of their existence is not fully understood in the quantum ML setting. In this paper, we benchmark the robustness of quantum ML networks, such as quantum variational classifiers (QVC), at scale by performing rigorous training for both simple and complex image datasets and through a variety of high-end adversarial attacks. Our results show that QVCs offer a notably enhanced robustness against classical adversarial attacks by learning features, which are not detected by the classical neural networks, indicating a possible quantum advantage for ML tasks. Contrarily, and remarkably, the converse is not true, with attacks on quantum networks also capable of deceiving classical neural networks. By combining quantum and classical network outcomes, we propose an adversarial attack detection technology. Traditionally quantum advantage in ML systems has been sought through increased accuracy or algorithmic speed-up, but our study has revealed the potential for a kind of quantum advantage through superior robustness of ML models, whose practical realization will address serious security concerns and reliability issues of ML algorithms employed in a myriad of applications including autonomous vehicles, cybersecurity, and surveillance robotic systems.",

      "abstract": "In the past few decades, in-flight icing has become a common problem for many missions, potentially leading to a reduction in control effectiveness and flight stability, which would threaten flight safety. One of the most popular methods to address this problem is adaptive control. This paper establishes a dynamic model of an iced high-altitude long-endurance unmanned aerial vehicle (HALE-UAV) with disturbance and measurement noise. Then, by combining multilayer perceptrons (MLP) with a nonlinear dynamic inversion (NDI) controller, we propose an MLP-NDI controller to compensate for online inversion errors and provide a brief proof of control stability. Two experiments were conducted: on one hand, we compared the MLP-NDI controller with other typical controllers; on the other hand, we evaluated its robustness and adaptiveness under different icing conditions. Results indicate that the MLP-NDI controller outperforms other typical controllers with higher tracking accuracy and exhibits strong robustness in the presence of icing errors and measurement noise, which has huge potential to ensure flight safety.",

      "abstract": "Robots are increasingly entering the social sphere and taking on more sophisticated roles. One application for which robots are already being deployed is in civilian security tasks, in which robots augment security and police forces. In this domain, robots will encounter individuals in crisis who may pose a threat to themselves, others, or personal property. In such interactions with human police and security officers, a key goal is to de-escalate the situation to resolve the interaction. This paper considers the task of utilizing mobile robots in de-escalation tasks, using the mechanisms developed for de-escalation in human\u2013human interactions. What strategies should a robot follow in order to leverage existing de-escalation approaches? Given these strategies, what sensing and interaction capabilities should a robot be capable of in order to engage in de-escalation tasks with humans? First, we discuss the current understanding of de-escalation with individuals in crisis and present a working model of the de-escalation process and strategies. Next, we review the capabilities that an autonomous agent should demonstrate to be able to apply such strategies in robot-mediated crisis de-escalation. Finally, we explore data-driven approaches to training robots in de-escalation and the next steps in moving the field forward.",

      "abstract": "Petrogenic hydrocarbon spills (PHS) are harmful to mangrove ecosystems along tropical coastlines in the short and long term. The aim of this study was to assess the environmental risk of recurrent PHS on mangrove ecosystems in Tumaco municipality, Colombian Pacific. Mangrove characteristics and management aspects led to subdividing the study area into 11 units-of-analysis (UAs) for which threats, vulnerability, potential impacts, and risks were assessed based on environmental factors and the formulation and use of indicators in a rating scale with five categories, which are very low, low, moderate, high, and very high. The results showed that all UAs are highly (64%; 15,525&nbsp;ha) or moderately (36%; 4,464&nbsp;ha) threatened by PHS, highly (45%; 13,478&nbsp;ha) or moderately (55%; 6,511&nbsp;ha) vulnerable to this kind of pollution, and susceptible to high (73%; 17,075&nbsp;ha) or moderate (27%; 2,914&nbsp;ha) potential impacts. The environmental risk was high in 73% (17,075&nbsp;ha) of the UAs, indicating likely irreversible damage to mangrove ecosystems by PHS, thus pointing to the need of urgent intervention by responsible authorities to ease their recovery and conservation. The methodology and results of this study become technical inputs that serve for environmental control and monitoring, which can be incorporated into contingency and risk management plans.",

      "abstract": "In this work, a multi-task convolutional neural network with multi-input (MIMT-CNN) is proposed for electromagnetic interference (EMI) signals recognition and electromagnetic environment risk evaluation of the data link of unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV). The visualized performance parameters, short-time Fourier transform (STFT) spectrograms, and constellation diagrams are obtained by experiment on the electromagnetic susceptibility of UAV\u2019s datalink. In particular, the constellation diagram is further enhanced by calculating the density distribution of sampling points to obtain the normalized density constellation. Taking the above different categories of images as the input of the expected model, the multi-element and high correlation EMI features are extracted and fused in the MIMT-CNN. Besides, the structure of series-parallel connection is adopted in the trained model and the Bayesian optimization is also used to select hyperparameters. In this case, the perception model with higher reliability can be obtained. On this basis, the performance and complexity of the obtained model with different input channels are compared. The results show that with the input of constellation diagram, especially the normalized density constellation, can significantly improve the accuracy of the model. Besides the normalized density constellation, the model with visualized performance parameters and STFT spectrogram as inputs has a much better performance.",

      "abstract": "In vehicle-to-everything (V2X) networks, security and safety are inherently difficult tasks due to the distinct characteristics of such networks, such as their highly dynamic topology and frequent connectivity disruptions. Jellyfish attacks are a sort of denial of service attack that are challenging to deal with, since they conform to protocol norms while impairing network performance, particularly in terms of communication overhead and reliability. Numerous existing approaches have developed new techniques with which to identify and prevent these attacks; however, no approach has been capable of facing all three types of Jellyfish attacks, which include reordering attacks, delay variance attacks, and periodic drop attacks. In this work, we design a new protocol that analyzes the behavior of every node in a network and selects the trusted routes for data transmission to their intended destination by calculating different Honesty metrics. The OMNET++ simulator was used to evaluate the overall performance of the proposed protocol. Various evaluation metrics, such as the packet delivery ratio, end-to-end delay, and throughput, are considered and compared with other existing approaches.",

      "abstract": "Time- and precision-critical applications, such as autonomous driving, have extremely rigorous standards for continuous high-precision positioning. The importance of precise point positioning (PPP) technology for self-navigation equipment is self-evident by delivering decimeter-/centimeter-level absolute position accuracy in a global coordinate framework. Nevertheless, the prolonged initialization period renders PPP almost too difficult to be widely used for time-critical applications in real transportation scenarios, for example, in city canyons and overpasses. We proposed a method to accomplish continuous decimeter-level positioning by leveraging triple-frequency GNSS observations with an Inertial Navigation System (INS) aiding in urban environments. In the proposed method, the inertial measurements and the original tri-frequency pseudorange and carrier phase measurements are tightly fused in an extended Kalman filter to obtain the optimal state estimate. Afterwards, with precise extra-wide-lane (EWL) and wide-lane (WL) Uncalibrated Phase Delay (UPD) products, the EWL and WL ambiguities can be resolved sequentially to implement instantaneous decimeter-level positioning. Exploiting the short-term high-precision characteristic of the INS, the continuity of the PPP solution can be ameliorated noticeably, and the ability of decimeter-level positioning can be maintained effortlessly throughout the navigation process. With land vehicle data collected, several experiments are undertaken to comprehensively assess the capability of the proposed system in urban scenarios, taking the solution obtained by a commercial post-processing software as the reference. The single-epoch decimeter-level position estimation can be captured instantaneously for WL ambiguity-fixed PPP solutions. Furthermore, for WL ambiguity-fixed PPP/INS-integrated solutions, the position estimation is better than 0.2 m for horizontal components and improved by 40\u201390% compared with that of the WL ambiguity-fixed PPP solutions. More importantly, the availability rate of positioning accuracy is better than 0.3 m in the horizontal direction and 0.5 m in the up direction reaching 93.91%, whereas it is only 53.78% for WL ambiguity-fixed PPP solutions. Overall, the WL ambiguity-fixed PPP/INS-integrated solutions have the favorable performance to maintain continuous decimeter-level positioning for self-navigation equipment, even if full GNSS outages are encountered.",

      "abstract": "The last remaining Dragon Tree Forest on Earth survives on a small plateau (Roqeb di Firmihin) in Socotra Island (Yemen). The Socotran Dragon\u2019s Blood Tree (Dracaena cinnabari Balf. f.) is endemic to the Socotra Archipelago UNESCO World Heritage Site. Being a culturally important and endangered tree species, its conservation is a priority. Despite this, a complete inventory of the Firmihin Dracaena forest (14.9 km2) has never been attempted before. We applied the use of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) for the first time in conserving the Socotran Dragon\u2019s Blood Tree. A pair of UAVs (small drones) were used during field surveys in 2021 to spatially describe individual tree positions, tree density, mortality, and the forest age structure. Aerial images were processed into a single orthophoto image of high spatial resolution (8 cm/pixel) used for detailed analysis. We applied image-enhancement techniques, used object-based classification, and corrected every entry manually during the inventory process. In total 35,542 individual living trees and 2123 uprooted trees were inventoried. The mean age of the forest, based on crown age (derived from crown size) was estimated at an average of ca. 300 years (291.5 years) with some individuals older than 500 years. Our analysis reveals that the trajectory of recent cyclones and the average direction of fallen trees in Firmihin are correlated, suggesting that intensified winds (as a result of global warming) catalyze the decline of the overmature forest. Our study illustrates the use of UAVs in collecting crucial data for the conservation and threat assessment of endangered tree species in Socotra, and regular drone inventories could be applied (e.g., after future cyclone events or landslides) to better evaluate the status of these vulnerable island ecosystems.",

      "abstract": "The roads we travel daily are exposed to several energy sources (mechanical load, solar radiation, heat, air movement, etc.), which can be exploited to make common systems and apparatus for roadways (i.e., lighting, video surveillance, and traffic monitoring systems) energetically autonomous. For decades, research groups have developed many technologies able to scavenge energy from the said sources related to roadways: electromagnetism, piezoelectric and triboelectric harvesters for the cars\u2019 stress and vibrations, photovoltaic modules for sunlight, thermoelectric solutions and pyroelectric materials for heat and wind turbines optimized for low-speed winds, such as the ones produced by moving vehicles. Thus, this paper explores the existing technologies for scavenging energy from sources available on roadways, both natural and related to vehicular transit. At first, to contextualize them within the application scenario, the available energy sources and transduction mechanisms were identified and described, arguing the main requirements that must be considered for developing harvesters applicable on roadways. Afterward, an overview of energy harvesting solutions presented in the scientific literature to recover energy from roadways is introduced, classifying them according to the transduction method (i.e., piezoelectric, triboelectric, electromagnetic, photovoltaic, etc.) and proposed system architecture. Later, a survey of commercial systems available on the market for scavenging energy from roadways is introduced, focusing on their architecture, performance, and installation methods. Lastly, comparative analyses are offered for each device category (i.e., scientific works and commercial products), providing insights to identify the most promising solutions and technologies for developing future self-sustainable smart roads.",

      "abstract": "Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), commonly known as drones, have found extensive applications across diverse sectors, such as agriculture, delivery, surveillance, and military. In recent times, drone swarming has emerged as a novel field of research, which involves multiple drones working in collaboration towards a shared objective. This innovation holds immense potential in transforming the way we undertake tasks, including military operations, environmental monitoring, and search and rescue missions. However, the emergence of drone swarms also brings new security challenges, as they can be susceptible to hacking and intrusion. To address these concerns, we propose utilizing a timed probabilistic automata (TPA)-based intrusion detection system (IDS) to model the normal behavior of drone swarms and identify any deviations that may indicate an intrusion. This IDS system is particularly efficient and adaptable in detecting different types of attacks in drone swarming. Its ability to adapt to evolving attack patterns and identify zero-day attacks makes it an invaluable tool in protecting drone swarms from malicious attacks.",

      "abstract": "In the 1990s, the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE) restricted its risk assessment for human exposure to radiofrequency radiation (RFR) in seven ways: (1) Inappropriate focus on heat, ignoring sub-thermal effects. (2) Reliance on exposure experiments performed over very short times. (3) Overlooking time/amplitude characteristics of RFR signals. (4) Ignoring carcinogenicity, hypersensitivity, and other health conditions connected with RFR. (5) Measuring cellphone Specific Absorption Rates (SAR) at arbitrary distances from the head. (6) Averaging SAR doses at volumetric/mass scales irrelevant to health. (7) Using unrealistic simulations for cell phone SAR estimations. Low-cost software and hardware modifications are proposed here for cellular phone RFR exposure mitigation: (1) inhibiting RFR emissions in contact with the body, (2) use of antenna patterns reducing the Percent of Power absorbed in the Head (PPHead) and body and increasing the Percent of Power Radiated for communications (PPR), and (3) automated protocol-based reductions of the number of RFR emissions, their duration, or integrated dose. These inexpensive measures do not fundamentally alter cell phone functions or communications quality. A health threat is scientifically documented at many levels and acknowledged by industries. Yet mitigation of RFR exposures to users does not appear as a priority with most cell phone manufacturers.",

      "abstract": "Deep neural networks have achieved remarkable performance in various fields such as image recognition and natural language processing. However, recent research has revealed that even a small imperceptible perturbation can confound well-trained neural network models and yield incorrect answers. Such adversarial examples are regarded as a key hazard to the application of machine learning techniques to safety-critical systems, such as unmanned vehicle navigation and security systems. In this study, we propose an efficient technique for searching one-pixel attacks in deep neural networks, which are recently reported as an adversarial example. Using exhaustive search, our method can identify one-pixel attacks which existing methods cannot detect. Moreover, the method can adjust exhaustiveness to reduce the search space dramatically. However, it still identifies most attacks. We present our experiment using the MNIST data set to demonstrate that our adjustable search method efficiently identifies one-pixel attacks in well-trained deep neural networks, including convolutional layers.",

      "abstract": "Reinforcement learning has shown a great ability and has defeated human beings in the field of real-time strategy games. In recent years, reinforcement learning has been used in cyberspace to carry out automated and intelligent attacks. Traditional defense methods are not enough to deal with this problem, so it is necessary to design defense agents to counter intelligent attacks. The interaction between the attack agent and the defense agent can be modeled as a multi-agent Markov game. In this paper, an adversarial decision-making approach that combines the Bayesian Strong Stackelberg and the WoLF algorithms was proposed to obtain the equilibrium point of multi-agent Markov games. With this method, the defense agent can obtain the adversarial decision-making strategy as well as continuously adjust the strategy in cyberspace. As verified in experiments, the defense agent should attach importance to short-term rewards in the process of a real-time game between the attack agent and the defense agent. The proposed approach can obtain the largest rewards for defense agent compared with the classic Nash-Q and URS-Q algorithms. In addition, the proposed approach adjusts the action selection probability dynamically, so that the decision entropy of optimal action gradually decreases.",

      "abstract": "High-level Automated Vehicles (HAVs) are expected to improve traffic safety significantly. However, verifying and evaluating HAVs remains an open problem. Scenario-based testing is a promising method for HAV testing. Boundary scenarios exist around the performance boundary between critical and non-critical scenarios. Testing HAVs in these boundary scenarios is crucial to investigate why collisions cannot be avoided due to small changes in scenario parameters. This study proposes a methodology to generate diverse boundary scenarios to test HAVs. First, an approach is proposed to obtain at least one High-Performance Classifier (HPC) based on two classification algorithms that iteratively guide each other to find uncertain scenarios to improve their performance. Then, the HPC is exploited to find candidate scenarios highly likely to be boundary scenarios. To increase the efficiency of candidate scenario generation, a strategy based on local sampling is presented to find more diverse candidate scenarios based on a small number of them. Numerical experiments show that the HPCs acquired by the method proposed in this study can achieve a classification accuracy of 98% and 99% for random car-following and cut-in scenarios, respectively. Moreover, more than 86% of 271,744 candidate cut-in scenarios derived by local sampling are near the performance boundary.",

      "abstract": "Detecting plant disease severity could help growers and researchers study how the disease impacts cereal crops to make timely decisions. Advanced technology is needed to protect cereals that feed the increasing population using fewer chemicals; this may lead to reduced labor usage and cost in the field. Accurate detection of wheat stem rust, an emerging threat to wheat production, could inform growers to make management decisions and assist plant breeders in making line selections. A hyperspectral camera mounted on an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) was utilized in this study to evaluate the severity of wheat stem rust disease in a disease trial containing 960 plots. Quadratic discriminant analysis (QDA) and random forest classifier (RFC), decision tree classification, and support vector machine (SVM) were applied to select the wavelengths and spectral vegetation indices (SVIs). The trial plots were divided into four levels based on ground truth disease severities: class 0 (healthy, severity 0), class 1 (mildly diseased, severity 1\u201315), class 2 (moderately diseased, severity 16\u201334), and class 3 (severely diseased, highest severity observed). The RFC method achieved the highest overall classification accuracy (85%). For the spectral vegetation indices (SVIs), the highest classification rate was recorded by RFC, and the accuracy was 76%. The Green NDVI (GNDVI), Photochemical Reflectance Index (PRI), Red-Edge Vegetation Stress Index (RVS1), and Chlorophyll Green (Chl green) were selected from 14 SVIs. In addition, binary classification of mildly diseased vs. non-diseased was also conducted using the classifiers and achieved 88% classification accuracy. This highlighted that hyperspectral imaging was sensitive enough to discriminate between low levels of stem rust disease vs. no disease. The results of this study demonstrated that drone hyperspectral imaging can discriminate stem rust disease levels so that breeders can select disease-resistant varieties more efficiently. The detection of low disease severity capability of drone hyperspectral imaging can help farmers identify early disease outbreaks and enable more timely management of their fields. Based on this study, it is also possible to build a new inexpensive multispectral sensor to diagnose wheat stem rust disease accurately.",

      "abstract": "Automating a factory where robots are involved is neither trivial nor cheap. Engineering the factory automation process in such a way that return of interest is maximized and risk for workers and equipment is minimized is hence, of paramount importance. Simulation can be a game changer in this scenario but requires advanced programming skills that domain experts and industrial designers might not have. In this paper, we present the preliminary design and implementation of a general-purpose framework for creating and exploiting Virtual Environments via Natural language Agents (VEsNA). VEsNA takes advantage of agent-based technologies and natural language processing to enhance the design of virtual environments. The natural language input provided to VEsNA is understood by a chatbot and passed to an intelligent cognitive agent that implements the logic behind displacing objects in the virtual environment. In the complete VEsNA vision, for which this paper provides the building blocks, the intelligent agent will be able to reason on this displacement and on its compliance with legal and normative constraints. It will also be able to implement what-if analysis and case-based reasoning. Objects populating the virtual environment will include active objects and will populate a dynamic simulation whose outcomes will be interpreted by the cognitive agent; further autonomous agents, representing workers in the factory, will be added to make the virtual environment even more realistic; explanations and suggestions will be passed back to the user by the chatbot.",

      "abstract": "Post-disaster search and rescue is critical to disaster response and recovery efforts and is often conducted in hazardous and challenging environments. However, the existing post-disaster search and rescue operations have problems such as low efficiency, limited search range, difficulty in identifying the nature of the target, and wrong target location. Therefore, this study develops an air\u2013ground integrated intelligent cognition visual enhancement system based on a UAV (VisionICE). The technique combines a portable AR display device, a camera-equipped helmet, and a quadcopter UAV for efficient patrols over a wide area. First, the system utilizes wireless image sensors on the UAV and helmet to capture images from the air and ground views. Using the YOLOv7 algorithm, the cloud server calculates and analyzes these visual data to accurately identify and detect targets. Lastly, the AR display device obtains real-time intelligent cognitive results. The system allows personnel to simultaneously acquire air and ground dual views and achieve brilliant cognitive results and immersive visual experiences in real time. The findings indicate that the system demonstrates significant recognition accuracy and mobility. In contrast to conventional post-disaster search and rescue operations, the system can autonomously identify and track targets of interest, addressing the difficulty of a person needing help to conduct field inspections in particular environments. At the same time, the system can issue potential threat or anomaly alerts to searchers, significantly enhancing their situational awareness capabilities.",

      "abstract": "Uncrewed aerial vehicles (UAVs), also known as drones, are ubiquitous and their use cases extend today from governmental applications to civil applications such as the agricultural, medical, and transport sectors, etc. In accordance with the requirements in terms of demand, it is possible to carry out various missions involving several types of UAVs as well as various onboard sensors. According to the complexity of the mission, some configurations are required both in terms of hardware and software. This task becomes even more complex when the system is composed of autonomous UAVs that collaborate with each other without the assistance of an operator. Several factors must be considered, such as the complexity of the mission, the types of UAVs, the communication architecture, the routing protocol, the coordination of tasks, and many other factors related to the environment. Unfortunately, although there are many research works that address the use cases of multi-UAV systems, there is a gap in the literature regarding the difficulties involved with the implementation of these systems from scratch. This review article seeks to examine and understand the communication issues related to the implementation from scratch of autonomous multi-UAV systems for collaborative decisions. The manuscript will also provide a formal definition of the ecosystem of a multi-UAV system, as well as a comparative study of UAV types and related works that highlight the use cases of multi-UAV systems. In addition to the mathematical modeling of the collaborative target detection problem in distributed environments, this article establishes a comparative study of communication architectures and routing protocols in a UAV network. After reading this review paper, readers will benefit from the multicriteria decision-making roadmaps to choose the right architectures and routing protocols adapted for specific missions. The open challenges and future directions described in this manuscript can be used to understand the current limitations and how to overcome them to effectively exploit autonomous swarms in future trends.",

      "abstract": "Autonomous vehicles in highway driving scenarios are expected to become a reality in the next few years. Decision-making and motion planning algorithms, which allow autonomous vehicles to predict and tackle unpredictable road traffic situations, play a crucial role. Indeed, finding the optimal driving decision in all the different driving scenarios is a challenging task due to the large and complex variability of highway traffic scenarios. In this context, the aim of this work is to design an effective hybrid two-layer path planning architecture that, by exploiting the powerful tools offered by the emerging Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) in combination with model-based approaches, lets the autonomous vehicles properly behave in different highway traffic conditions and, accordingly, to determine the lateral and longitudinal control commands. Specifically, the DRL-based high-level planner is responsible for training the vehicle to choose tactical behaviors according to the surrounding environment, while the low-level control converts these choices into the lateral and longitudinal vehicle control actions to be imposed through an optimization problem based on Nonlinear Model Predictive Control (NMPC) approach, thus enforcing continuous constraints. The effectiveness of the proposed hierarchical architecture is hence evaluated via an integrated vehicular platform that combines the MATLAB environment with the SUMO (Simulation of Urban MObility) traffic simulator. The exhaustive simulation analysis, carried out on different non-trivial highway traffic scenarios, confirms the capability of the proposed strategy in driving the autonomous vehicles in different traffic scenarios.",

Wireless communication allows UAVs to exchange information, but for the situations requiring high security, electromagnetic silence is needed to avoid potential threats. The passive UAV formation maintenance strategies can fulfill the requirement of electromagnetic silence at the cost of heavy real-time computing and precise locations of UAVs. To pursue high real-time performance without the localization of UAVs, this paper proposes a scalable distributed control algorithm for bearing-only passive UAV formation maintenance. By minimizing necessary communication, pure angle information is applied to maintain UAV formations through distributed control, without the knowledge of the UAVs\u2019 precise locations. The convergency of the proposed algorithm is proven strictly and the converging radius is derived. Through simulation, the proposed algorithm is proven to be suitable for a general case and demonstrates fast convergence speed, strong anti-interference capability, and high scalability.",

      "abstract": "Unmanned Aerial Vehicles, also known as UAVs, play an increasingly important part in daily life. However, the ever-increasing number of UAVs pose an ever-increasing threat to the transportation infrastructure. Despite their precision and general efficiency, infrastructural-scale Unmanned Aerial Systems (UASs) have a disadvantage regarding their capability of being implanted in the ecosystem. There are several reasons for this, but the primary bottleneck is that their systems are not transparent to society and have very complicated processes. As a result, the authors decided to investigate the functional properties of UASs and make improvements to those properties. Throughout the study, the authors\u2019 primary focus was on analysis, which boosts productivity and ensures a significant level of safety for routine flights. The amount of power that a UAV uses depends on several variables, including the amount of power that its individual components require, the temperature of its surroundings, and the condition of the battery that it is powered by. Therefore, critical parameters and interdependencies are taken into account in the risk assessment strategy for energy-efficient Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs). In the case of UAVs, the algorithm performs a risk calculation before take-off to estimate the amount of risk that can be associated with the given flight time when using the provided battery. On the one hand, several instances of the pre-take-off state and how its parameters interact are investigated. On the other hand, they demonstrate the calculation of the risk while in flight, which is based on actual flight data.",

In this article, multi-UAV applications are grouped into five classes based on their primary task: coverage, adversarial search and game, computational offloading, communication, and target-driven navigation. By employing a systematic review approach, we select the most significant works that use deep reinforcement learning (DRL) techniques for cooperative and scalable multi-UAV systems and discuss their features using extensive and constructive critical reasoning. Finally, we present the most likely and promising research directions by highlighting the limitations of the currently held assumptions and the constraints when dealing with collaborative DRL-based multi-UAV systems. The suggested areas of research can enhance the transfer of knowledge from simulations to real-world environments and can increase the responsiveness and safety of UAV systems.",

      "abstract": "Despite rapid advances in vehicle intelligence and connectivity, there is still a significant period in mixed traffic where connected, automated vehicles and human-driven vehicles coexist. The behavioral uncertainty of human-driven vehicles makes decision-making a challenging task in an unsignalized intersection scenario. In this paper, a decentralized multi-agent proximal policy optimization (MAPPO) based on an attention representations algorithm (Attn-MAPPO) was developed to make joint decisions at an intersection to avoid collisions and cross the intersection effectively. To implement this framework, by exploiting the shared information, the system was modeled as a model-free, fully cooperative, multi-agent system. The vehicle employed an attention module to extract the most valuable information from its neighbors. Based on the observation and traffic rules, a joint policy was identified to work more cooperatively based on the trajectory prediction of all the vehicles. To facilitate the collaboration between the vehicles, a weighted reward assignment scheme was proposed to focus more on the vehicles approaching intersections. The results presented the advantages of the Attn-MAPPO framework and validated the effectiveness of the designed reward function. Ultimately, the comparative experiments were conducted to demonstrate that the proposed approach was more adaptive and generalized than the heuristic rule-based model, which revealed its great potential for reinforcement learning in the decision-making of autonomous driving.",

      "abstract": "This study proposed a novel nonlinear blended aerodynamic model for the tiltrotor unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) during the transition phase to handle the high angle-of-attack (AoA) flight, which aggregated the flat-plate mode and the linear mode of the aerodynamic coefficients. Additionally, a harmonic disturbance observer (HDO) and super-twisting sliding mode controller (STSMC) addressed the fast-changing external disturbances and attenuated the chattering problem in the original SMC. The comparative trajectory tracking results indicated that the blended aerodynamic model accurately tracks the reference signals with no tracking errors, which demonstrated a superior performance as compared to the traditional aerodynamic model, with a reduction of 2.2%, 50%, 73.6%, and 11.2% in the time required for tracking the pitch angle, pitch rate, and velocities u and w, respectively. Conversely, the traditional one exhibited significant tracking errors, ranging from 0.016\u00b0 in the pitch angle channel to 1.25\u00b0/s in the pitch rate channel, and 0.6 m/s for velocity u and 0.01 m/s for velocity w. Moreover, the comparative control input results illustrated that the least control effort was required for the proposed HDO-STSMC control scheme with a blending function, while the original ESO-SMC experienced more oscillations and sharp amplitude changes, taking twice the time to converge, with considerable tracking errors such as 1.067\u00b0 in the pitch angle channel, 0.788\u00b0/s in the pitch rate channel, 1.554 m/s for velocity u, and 0.746 m/s for velocity w, which verified the feasibility and superiority of the proposed HDO-STSMC with the blending function. Two performance indices revealed the robust stability and rapid convergence of the proposed transition blended aerodynamic model with the HDO-STSMC control scheme.",

      "abstract": "Connected and autonomous vehicles (CAVs) present exciting opportunities for the improvement of both the mobility of people and the efficiency of transportation systems. The small computers in autonomous vehicles (CAVs) are referred to as electronic control units (ECUs) and are often perceived as being a component of a broader cyber\u2013physical system. Subsystems of ECUs are often networked together via a variety of in-vehicle networks (IVNs) so that data may be exchanged, and the vehicle can operate more efficiently. The purpose of this work is to explore the use of machine learning and deep learning methods in defence against cyber threats to autonomous cars. Our primary emphasis is on identifying erroneous information implanted in the data buses of various automobiles. In order to categorise this type of erroneous data, the gradient boosting method is used, providing a productive illustration of machine learning. To examine the performance of the proposed model, two real datasets, namely the Car-Hacking and UNSE-NB15 datasets, were used. Real automated vehicle network datasets were used in the verification process of the proposed security solution. These datasets included spoofing, flooding and replay attacks, as well as benign packets. The categorical data were transformed into numerical form via pre-processing. Machine learning and deep learning algorithms, namely k-nearest neighbour (KNN) and decision trees, long short-term memory (LSTM), and deep autoencoders, were employed to detect CAN attacks. According to the findings of the experiments, using the decision tree and KNN algorithms as machine learning approaches resulted in accuracy levels of 98.80% and 99%, respectively. On the other hand, the use of LSTM and deep autoencoder algorithms as deep learning approaches resulted in accuracy levels of 96% and 99.98%, respectively. The maximum accuracy was achieved when using the decision tree and deep autoencoder algorithms. Statistical analysis methods were used to analyse the results of the classification algorithms, and the determination coefficient measurement for the deep autoencoder was found to reach a value of R2 = 95%. The performance of all of the models that were built in this way surpassed that of those already in use, with almost perfect levels of accuracy being achieved. The system developed is able to overcome security issues in IVNs.",

      "abstract": "Image degradation caused by bad weather, such as haze, rain, and snow, significantly degrades a vision system\u2019s performance, imposing challenges to the autonomous motion of mobile robots. Therefore, it is crucial to restore the degraded images for mobile robots operating outdoors. Spurred by this concern, a framework that restores degraded images and affords simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM) under multiple bad weather conditions is presented. Specifically, the developed architecture combines the advantages of convolutional neural network features and weather features. It improves the accuracy of identifying the degradation type by developing a weather inference module based on ensemble learning. According to the internal mechanism of image degradation, a degraded image restoration method is proposed utilizing physical models, with a subsequent operation refining the preliminary restored results. To improve our method\u2019s adaptability to real scenes, unpaired real-world weather images are introduced into the degradation removal algorithm through generative adversarial networks. The proposed weather persistent assumption combines weather inference and degradation restoration modules in the SLAM system to capture multiple weather conditions, which improves the system\u2019s accuracy and running speed. Comprehensive experiments evaluating the developed framework and its components highlight that the proposed weather inference and degraded image restoration methods achieve a highly appealing effect. The final experimental results demonstrate that our framework autonomously identifies weather types, triggers the corresponding restoration, and realizes accurate localization in multiple bad weather conditions. It affords SLAM accuracy under multiple bad weather conditions that is close to raw SLAM in clear weather.",

      "abstract": "ABSTRACT Background: This study aimed to evaluate UAV images of Pinus taeda L. stands for classifying trees attacked by Sapajus nigritus in Southern Brazil. UAV images were acquired on March 2018, using a DJI Phantom Pro 4 over 18.73 hectares. We evaluated different band compositions and vegetation indices. Using photo interpretation based on the color of the crown and field measurements, the trees were manually labeled as not attacked, dead, and attacked. The classified trees were divided into training (75%) and validation (25%), considering three tree crown diameters (0.5, 1, and 1.5 m) and three region-oriented classification algorithms. The classification accuracy was assessed by overall accuracy and the kappa index. Results: A total of 3,773 trees were manually detected, of which 39% were attacked, 5% died and 56% were not attacked. The results also indicated that the best-chosen diameter was 0.5 meters, the best classifier algorithm was the SVM, and the highest accuracy was represented by the composition of the ExG index associated with the original spectral bands. Conclusion: We argue that the attacks can be monitored using UAV images and such results provide insights for forest management initiatives.",

      "abstract": "One critical bottleneck that impedes the development and deployment of autonomous vehicles is the prohibitively high economic and time costs required to validate their safety in a naturalistic driving environment, owing to the rarity of safety-critical events1. Here we report the development of an intelligent testing environment, where artificial-intelligence-based background agents are trained to validate the safety performances of autonomous vehicles in an accelerated mode, without loss of unbiasedness. From naturalistic driving data, the background agents learn what adversarial manoeuvre to execute&nbsp;through a dense deep-reinforcement-learning (D2RL) approach, in which Markov decision processes are edited by removing non-safety-critical states and reconnecting critical ones so that the information in the training data is densified. D2RL enables neural networks to learn from densified information with safety-critical events and achieves tasks that are intractable for traditional deep-reinforcement-learning approaches. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach by testing a highly automated vehicle in both highway and urban test tracks with an augmented-reality environment, combining simulated background vehicles with physical road infrastructure and&nbsp;a real autonomous test vehicle. Our results show that the D2RL-trained agents can accelerate the evaluation process by multiple orders of magnitude (103 to 105 times faster). In addition, D2RL will enable accelerated testing and training with other safety-critical autonomous systems. An intelligent environment has been developed for testing the safety performance of autonomous vehicles and its effectiveness has been&nbsp;demonstrated for highway and urban test tracks in an augmented-reality environment.",

      "abstract": "This paper aims to perform metric measurements of narrow street fa\u00e7ades using single image captured by smartphone\u2019s camera. Since tight area accompanied by narrow street limits object to camera distance, object lines perpendicular to fa\u00e7ade do not appear in image and consequently their vanishing point (VP) is hard to detect. Accordingly, semi-automated MATLAB\u00ae application was designed depending only on two orthogonal VPs. Novelty of work comes from using smartphone as a cost and time efficient tool for measurements, depending only on two VPs, and applying image line refinement approach exploiting detected VPs. Three single images were captured by three different smartphones. Then, undistorted single images were formed after calibrating cameras. Image lines for horizontal and vertical object lines were extracted semi-automatically. Two VPs were detected applying two models: Model-I solves for vanishing points\u2019 Cartesian coordinates, whereas Model-II solves for angle coordinate peaks of histogram. Image line refinement approach was applied before applying cross-ratio using one horizontal and one vertical reference lines to calculate object lengths of 46 check lines (horizontal and vertical). Proposed models provided reliable and comparable results. Applying line refinement approach improved solution with best overall accuracy of 0.010 m and 0.011 m for Model-I and Model-II, respectively.",

      "abstract": "  Autonomous vehicle is one the prominent area of research in computer vision. In today\u2019s AI world, the concept of autonomous vehicles has become popular largely to avoid accidents due to negligence of driver. Perceiving the depth of the surrounding region accurately is a challenging task in autonomous vehicles. Sensors like light detection and ranging can be used for depth estimation but these sensors are expensive. Hence stereo matching is an alternate solution to estimate the depth. The main difficulties observed in stereo matching is to minimize mismatches in the ill-posed regions, like occluded, texture less and discontinuous regions. This paper presents an efficient deep stereo matching technique for estimating disparity map from stereo images in ill-posed regions. The images from Middlebury stereo data set are used to assess the efficacy of the model proposed. The experimental outcome dipicts that the proposed model generates reliable results in the occluded, texture less and discontinuous regions as compared to the existing techniques.  ",

      "abstract": "Autonomous vehicles need to continuously navigate complex traffic environments by efficiently analyzing the surrounding scene, understanding the behavior of other traffic agents, and predicting their future trajectories. The primary objective is to draw up a safe motion and reduce the reaction time for possibly imminent hazards. The main problem addressed in this paper is to explore the movement patterns of surrounding traffic-agents and accurately predict their future trajectories for assisting the vehicle to make a reasonable decision. Traditional trajectory prediction modules require explicit coordinate information to model the interaction between the autonomous car and its surrounding vehicles. However, it is hard to know the real coordinate of surrounding vehicles in real-world scenarios without communications between vehicles. A GAN (generative adversarial network)-based deep learning framework is presented in this paper for predicting the trajectories of surrounding vehicles of an autonomous vehicle in an RGB image sequence without explicit coordinate annotation to solve this problem. To automatically predict the trajectory from RGB image sequences, a coordinate augmentation module and a coordinate stabilization module are proposed to extract the historical trajectory from an image sequence. Meanwhile, the self-attention mechanism is also proposed to improve the social pooling module for better capturing the context information of trajectories of surrounding vehicles. Experimental results are demonstrated that the proposed method is effective and efficient.",

      "abstract": "This paper proposes a fast cooperative path planning algorithm for multiple UAVs that satisfies the time\u2013space cooperative constraints, namely, the RRT* algorithm based on heuristic decentralized prioritized planning (HDP-TSRRT*), which takes into account the simultaneous arrival time variables of each UAV as well as the avoidance of conflicts and threats. HDP-TSRRT* is a hierarchical decoupling algorithm. First, all UAV pre-paths are planned simultaneously at the synchronous decentralized planning level. Second, at the coordination path level, the heuristic decentralized prioritized planning algorithm (HDP) is proposed to quickly complete the coordination process of the path planning sequence. This strategy assigns reasonable and robust priority to all UAVs based on the performance evaluation function composed of the number of potential collisions and the violation of collaboration time of the pre-planned path. Third, the time\u2013space cooperative constraints-based RRT* algorithm (TSRRT*) is proposed at the single-machine cooperative path planning level. Based on this, the algorithm uses multiple sampling and cost evaluation strategies to guide the expansion of new nodes, and then optimizes neighborhood nodes based on the time coordination cost function so as to improve the efficiency of coordination path planning. Simulation and comparison show that HDP-TSRRT* has certain advantages in algorithm performance.",

      "abstract": "The Blue Economy, which is based on the sustainable use of the ocean, is demanding better understanding of marine ecosystems, which provide assets, goods, and services. Such understanding requires the use of modern exploration technologies, including unmanned underwater vehicles, in order to acquire quality information for decision-making processes. This paper addresses the design process for an underwater glider, to be used in oceanographic research, that was inspired by leatherback sea turtles (Dermochelys coriacea), which are known to have a superior diving ability and enhanced hydrodynamic performance. The design process combines elements from Systems Engineering and bioinspired design approaches. The conceptual and preliminary design stages are first described, and they allowed mapping the user\u2019s requirements into engineering characteristics, using quality function deployment to generate the functional architecture, which later facilitated the integration of the components and subsystems. Then, we emphasize the shell\u2019s bioinspired hydrodynamic design and provide the design solution for the desired vehicle\u2019s specifications. The bioinspired shell yielded a lift coefficient increase due to the effect of ridges and a decrease in the drag coefficient at low angles of attack. This led to a greater lift-to-drag ratio, a desirable condition for underwater gliders, since we obtained a greater lift while producing less drag than the shape without longitudinal ridges.",

The dynamics model of the quadrotor was derived using Newton Euler formalism; furthermore, its linearization was processed by the Jacobian matrix at every estimated state. The enhanced state observer is essentially based on a continuous-discrete nonlinear Kalman filter combined with the optimization of Madgwick method for quaternion orientation. The approach relies on flight dynamics predictions and gets updated by the onboard measurement of sensors at different feeding rates. A discrete linear quadratic tracker was developed for best tracking performance and robustness while avoiding collision with predefined static obstacles. Quaternion orientations and attitude and heading reference system were validated by experimental tests at less than one degree of precision error, whereas the proposed adaptive LQG control of quadrotor was simulated for tracking control and validated in Simulink environment in the presence of Gaussian random perturbations, LQG performance has been compared to the linear inner-outer looping PID, integral backstepping (IBS), and decentralized fuzzy logic control (FLC) strategies. Obtained results validated the effectiveness and robustness of the opted methodology.",

      "abstract": "The task of achieving a safe and short landing for a flying-wing unmanned aircraft with a three-bearing-swivel thrust vector is highly challenging. The process is further complicated due to the need to switch between multiple control modes, while also ensuring the protection of the flight boundaries from environmental disturbances and model uncertainties to ensure flight safety. To address this challenge, this paper proposes a short-landing strategy that employs mixed control using lift fans, thrust vectors, and aerodynamic control surfaces. The extended state observer (ESO) is integrated into the inner angular rate control and outer sink rate control to account for environmental disturbances and model uncertainties. To ensure flight safety, the attainable linear and angular acceleration is calculated through a trim analysis to determine the command value of velocity and angle of attack during a short landing. Additionally, a flight boundary protection method is employed which includes an additional command value of the angle of attack, resulting in a higher probability of a successful landing. This paper provides a detailed description of the short-landing strategy, including the control objectives for each phase. Finally, a Monte Carlo simulation is conducted to evaluate the effectiveness and robustness of the short-landing strategy, and the landing accuracy is assessed using the circular error probability metric.",

      "abstract": "Infectious diseases contribute significantly to the global disease burden. Sensitive and accurate screening methods are some of the most effective means of identifying sources of infection and controlling infectivity. Conventional detecting strategies such as quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR), DNA sequencing, and mass spectrometry typically require bulky equipment and well-trained personnel. Therefore, mass screening of a large population using conventional strategies during pandemic periods often requires additional manpower, resources, and time, which cannot be guaranteed in resource-limited settings. Recently, emerging microfluidic technologies have shown the potential to replace conventional methods in performing point-of-care detection because they are automated, miniaturized, and integrated. By exploiting the spatial separation of detection sites, microfluidic platforms can enable the multiplex detection of infectious diseases to reduce the possibility of misdiagnosis and incomplete diagnosis of infectious diseases with similar symptoms. This review presents the recent advances in microfluidic platforms used for multiplex detection of infectious diseases, including microfluidic immunosensors and microfluidic nucleic acid sensors. As representative microfluidic platforms, lateral flow immunoassay (LFIA) platforms, polymer-based chips, paper-based devices, and droplet-based devices will be discussed in detail. In addition, the current challenges, commercialization, and prospects are proposed to promote the application of microfluidic platforms in infectious disease detection.",

      "abstract": "In human-computer gaming scenarios, the autonomous decision-making problem of an unmanned combat air vehicle (UCAV) is a complex sequential decision-making problem involving multiple decision-makers. In this paper, an autonomous maneuver decision-making method for UCAV that considers the partially observable states of Human (the adversary) is proposed, building on a game-theoretic approach. The maneuver decision-making process within the current time horizon is modeled as a game of Human and UCAV, which significantly reduces the computational complexity of the entire decision-making process. In each established game decision-making model, an improved maneuver library that contains all possible maneuvers (called the continuous maneuver library) is designed, and each of these maneuvers corresponds to a mixed strategy of the established game. In addition, the unobservable states of Human are predicted via the Nash equilibrium strategy of the previous decision-making stage. Finally, the effectiveness of the proposed method is verified by some adversarial experiments.",

      "abstract": "In this paper, a four-dimensional (4D) dynamic cooperative path planning algorithm for multiple unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) is proposed, in which the cooperative time variables of UAVs, as well as conflict and threat avoidance, are considered. The algorithm proposed in this paper uses a hierarchical framework that is divided into a 4D cooperative planning layer and a local threat avoidance planning layer. In the cooperative planning layer, the proposed algorithm, named dynamic priority rapidly exploring random trees (DPRRT*), would be used for the 4D cooperative path planning of all UAVs involved in a given task. We first designed a heuristic prioritization strategy in the DPRRT* algorithm to rank all UAVs to improve the efficiency of cooperative planning. Then, the improved RRT* algorithm with the 4D coordination cost function was used to plan the 4D coordination path for each UAV. Whenever the environment changes dynamically (i.e., sudden static or moving threats), the proposed heuristic artificial potential field algorithm (HAPF) in the local threat avoidance planning layer is used to plan the local collision avoidance path. After completing local obstacle avoidance planning, the DPRRT* of the 4D cooperative planning layer is again called upon for path replanning to finally realize 4D cooperative path planning for all UAVs. The simulation and comparison experiments prove the feasibility, efficiency, and robustness of the proposed algorithm.",

Agents in MAS exploit their social abilities, interacting with peers, and their situated capabilities as well, by perceiving and acting on the world around them. From distributed computing to intelligent systems, the relevance of agents and MAS as software abstractions is steadily growing as they are extensively and increasingly used to model, simulate, and build heterogeneous systems across a huge variety of diverse application scenarios and business domains, ranging from industrial manufacturing to robotics, from social simulation to applications, and more. The recent, renewed popularity of AI techniques has further spread the adoption of MAS, focusing in particular on the cognitive capabilities of agents, so that intelligent systems can be modelled and built as MAS. Along those lines, this Special Issue gathers five contributions that well represent the many diverse advancements that are currently ongoing in the MAS field.",

      "abstract": "Precision agriculture and smart farming have received significant attention due to the advancements made in remote sensing technology to support agricultural efficiency. In large-scale agriculture, the role of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) has increased in remote monitoring and collecting farm data at regular intervals. However, due to an open environment, UAVs can be hacked to malfunction and report false data. Due to limited battery life and flight times requiring frequent recharging, a compromised UAV wastes precious energy when performing unnecessary functions. Furthermore, it impacts other UAVs competing for charging times at the station, thus disrupting the entire data collection mechanism. In this paper, a fog computing-based smart farming framework is proposed that utilizes UAVs to gather data from IoT sensors deployed in farms and offloads it at fog sites deployed at the network edge. The framework adopts the concept of a charging token, where upon completing a trip, UAVs receive tokens from the fog node. These tokens can later be redeemed to charge the UAVs for their subsequent trips. An intrusion detection system is deployed at the fog nodes that utilize machine learning models to classify UAV behavior as malicious or benign. In the case of malicious classification, the fog node reduces the tokens, resulting in the UAV not being able to charge fully for the duration of the trip. Thus, such UAVs are automatically eliminated from the UAV pool. The results show a 99.7% accuracy in detecting intrusions. Moreover, due to token-based elimination, the system is able to conserve energy. The evaluation of CPU and memory usage benchmarks indicates that the system is capable of efficiently collecting smart-farm data, even in the presence of attacks.",

      "abstract": "The Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) is unreliable in some situations. To mend the poor GNSS signal, an autonomous vehicle can self-localize by matching a ground image against a database of geotagged aerial images. However, this approach has challenges because of the dramatic differences in the viewpoint between aerial and ground views, harsh weather and lighting conditions, and the lack of orientation information in training and deployment environments. In this paper, it is shown that previous models in this area are complementary, not competitive, and that each model solves a different aspect of the problem. There was a need for a holistic approach. An ensemble model is proposed to aggregate the predictions of multiple independently trained state-of-the-art models. Previous state-of-the-art (SOTA) temporal-aware models used heavy-weight network to fuse the temporal information into the query process. The effect of making the query process temporal-aware is explored and exploited by an efficient meta block: naive history. But none of the existing benchmark datasets was suitable for extensive temporal awareness experiments, a new derivative dataset based on the BDD100K dataset is generated. The proposed ensemble model achieves a recall accuracy R@1 (Recall@1: the top most prediction) of 97.74% on the CVUSA dataset and 91.43% on the CVACT dataset (surpassing the current SOTA). The temporal awareness algorithm converges to R@1 of 100% by looking at a few steps back in the trip history.",

      "abstract": "In Australia, peanuts are mainly grown in Queensland with tropical and subtropical climates. The most common foliar disease that poses a severe threat to quality peanut production is late leaf spot (LLS). Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) have been widely investigated for various plant trait estimations. The existing works on UAV-based remote sensing have achieved promising results for crop disease estimation using a mean or a threshold value to represent the plot-level image data, but these methods might be insufficient to capture the distribution of pixels within a plot. This study proposes two new methods, namely measurement index (MI) and coefficient of variation (CV), for LLS disease estimation on peanuts. We first investigated the relationship between the UAV-based multispectral vegetation indices (VIs) and the LLS disease scores at the late growth stages of peanuts. We then compared the performances of the proposed MI and CV-based methods with the threshold and mean-based methods for LLS disease estimation. The results showed that the MI-based method achieved the highest coefficient of determination and the lowest error for five of the six chosen VIs whereas the CV-based method performed the best for simple ratio (SR) index among the four methods. By considering the strengths and weaknesses of each method, we finally proposed a cooperative scheme based on the MI, the CV and the mean-based methods for automatic disease estimation, demonstrated by applying this scheme to the LLS estimation in peanuts.",

      "abstract": "Recently, the unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) synthetic aperture radar (SAR) has become a highly sought-after topic for its wide applications in target recognition, detection, and tracking. However, SAR automatic target recognition (ATR) models based on deep neural networks (DNN) are suffering from adversarial examples. Generally, non-cooperators rarely disclose any SAR-ATR model information, making adversarial attacks challenging. To tackle this issue, we propose a novel attack method called Transferable Adversarial Network (TAN). It can craft highly transferable adversarial examples in real time and attack SAR-ATR models without any prior knowledge, which is of great significance for real-world black-box attacks. The proposed method improves the transferability via a two-player game, in which we simultaneously train two encoder\u2013decoder models: a generator that crafts malicious samples through a one-step forward mapping from original data, and an attenuator that weakens the effectiveness of malicious samples by capturing the most harmful deformations. Particularly, compared to traditional iterative methods, the encoder\u2013decoder model can one-step map original samples to adversarial examples, thus enabling real-time attacks. Experimental results indicate that our approach achieves state-of-the-art transferability with acceptable adversarial perturbations and minimum time costs compared to existing attack methods, making real-time black-box attacks without any prior knowledge a reality.",

      "abstract": "Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) are excellent tools with extensive demand. During the last phase of landing, they require additional support to that of GPS. This can be achieved through the UAV\u2019s perception system based on its on-board camera and intelligence, and with which decisions can be made as to how to land on a platform (target). A cognitive computation approach is proposed to recognize this target that has been specifically designed to translate human reasoning into computational procedures by computing two probabilities of detection which are combined considering the fuzzy set theory for proper decision-making. The platform design is based on: (1) spectral information in the visible range which are uncommon colors in the UAV\u2019s operating environments (indoors and outdoors) and (2) specific figures in the foreground, which allow partial perception of each figure. We exploit color image properties from specific-colored figures embedded on the platform and which are identified by applying image processing and pattern recognition techniques, including Euclidean Distance Smart Geometric Analysis, to identify the platform in a very efficient and reliable manner. The test strategy uses 800 images captured with a smartphone onboard a quad-rotor UAV. The results verify the proposed method outperforms existing strategies, especially those that do not use color information. Platform recognition is also possible even with only a partial view of the target, due to image capture under adverse conditions. This demonstrates the effectiveness and robustness of the proposed cognitive computing-based perception system.",

      "abstract": "The rock slopes along the Sichuan\u2013Tibet railway are characterized by noncontactless, inaccessible, dramatically fluctuating topography and large-scale areas. Numerous high-position, concealed dangerous rock blocks (HPCDRBs) are located on such slopes, potentially threatening the construction and safety operation of the Sichuan\u2013Tibet railway. To this end, a new framework is proposed for geometrical investigation and stability analysis of HPCDRBs. The main steps of the framework are: (1) establishment of a three-dimensional high-resolution rock surface model using a new unmanned aerial vehicle-based photography method; (2) identification of possible HPCDRBs based on the theory of structure-controlled rock mass; (3) geometrical characterization of possible HPCDRBs utilizing polyhedral models; and (4) application of block theory for the stability analysis of possible HPCDRBs. In this framework, the actual positions and geometric information of these blocks are well-reflected, and the obtained parameters can directly serve the stability analysis. The proposed method is applied to an ultrahigh-steep rock slope located on the left bank of the Kang Yu Qu (KYQ) Bridge of the Sichuan\u2013Tibet railway. A total of 40 HPCDRBs with volumes between 2.1 and 148.2 m3 are determined, and the geometric shapes are mainly hexahedron and heptahedron. The mean sliding orientation of these blocks is 124.6\u00b0\u222051.4\u00b0. A seismic stability analysis is finally conducted to further discuss the stability of the HPCDRBs under a real earthquake. In summary, the collapse of the unstable HPCDRBs may cause single block falls which pose a potential threat to the KYQ Bridge.",

      "abstract": "Analyzing the data from an electrocardiogram (ECG) can reveal important details about a patient's heart health. A key component of modern medicine is the use of AI and ML-based computer-aided diagnosis tools to aid in making life-or-death decisions. It is common practice to use them in cardiology for the automatic early diagnosis of a variety of potentially fatal illnesses. The machine learning algorithm's need for a large amount of training data to build the learning model is an empirical challenge in the medical domain. To address this challenge, study into methods for creating synthetic patient data has blossomed. There is a higher risk of privacy invasion due to the need for massive amounts of training data for deep learning automated medical diagnostic systems that may help assess the state of the heart from this signal. To combat this issue, researchers have tried to create artificial ECG readings by analyzing only the statistical distributions of the accessible authentic training data.The primary goal of this study is to learn how generative adversarial networks can be used to create artificial ECG signals for use as training data in a classification task. In this study, we used both GAN and WGAN for generation of artificial ECG signals.",

      "abstract": "Deep learning (DL) models have recently been widely used in UAV aerial image semantic segmentation tasks and have achieved excellent performance. However, DL models are vulnerable to adversarial examples, which bring significant security risks to safety-critical systems. Existing research mainly focuses on solving digital attacks for aerial image semantic segmentation, but adversarial patches with physical attack attributes are more threatening than digital attacks. In this article, we systematically evaluate the threat of adversarial patches on the aerial image semantic segmentation task for the first time. To defend against adversarial patch attacks and obtain accurate semantic segmentation results, we construct a novel robust feature extraction network (RFENet). Based on the characteristics of aerial images and adversarial patches, RFENet designs a limited receptive field mechanism (LRFM), a spatial semantic enhancement module (SSEM), a boundary feature perception module (BFPM) and a global correlation encoder module (GCEM), respectively, to solve adversarial patch attacks from the DL model architecture design level. We discover that semantic features, shape features and global features contained in aerial images can significantly enhance the robustness of the DL model against patch attacks. Extensive experiments on three aerial image benchmark datasets demonstrate that the proposed RFENet has strong resistance to adversarial patch attacks compared with the existing state-of-the-art methods.",

      "abstract": "Evidence of the IoT is expanding the number of connected devices, including UAVs. UAVs overcome the flaws in the physical IoT infrastructure already in place. Low-altitude views are expected to be dominant swiftly in urban areas. In a short period of time, they are able to cover a large area and distribute goods and information around the globe. Additionally, how to provide a safe and secure UAV operation in high-level traffic circumstances is also a topic of investigation. When operating an UAV in a limited area, the IoLoUA system is used to maintain order. Additionally, it aids with node exploration. Basic principles that can be used to create new structural designs are analysed for both networks (IoLoUA). There has been an explanation of the IoLoUA strategy\u2019s approach to implementation so far. Among the issues covered in this article are UAV-generated IoT data collection and delivery, security threats, and typical workflow approaches. This work presents a theoretical model of future design evolution.",

      "abstract": "Underwater robotics is rapidly evolving due to the increasing demand for marine resource exploitation. Compared with rigid robots propelled by propellers, bionic robots are stealthier and more maneuverable, such as autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs) and remotely operated vehicles (ROVs), making them widely used underwater. In order to study the motion state of the umbrella jellyfish bionic robot, the displacement of the jellyfish robot along the same direction and the surrounding fluid pressure distribution caused by the jellyfish motion under different experimental conditions are discussed in this paper. The effect of different environmental factors on driving the jellyfish robot is determined by comparing the displacements at different observation points. The results of the study show that the lower the frequency and the longer the motion period, the greater the displacement produced by the robot within the same motion period. Frequency has a significant effect on the motion state of the jellyfish robot. While the change of amplitude also affects the motion state of the jellyfish robot, the displacement of the relaxation phase of the jellyfish robot is much smaller than that of the contraction phase with a small amplitude. It can be concluded that the effect of frequency on robot displacement is greater than the effect of amplitude on robot displacement. This study qualitatively discusses the changes of the motion state of the bionic jellyfish robot in still water under the excitation of different frequencies and amplitudes, and the results can provide corresponding reference for the future application of the bionic jellyfish robot, such as resource exploration, underwater exploration, and complex environment exploration.",

      "abstract": "Considering the importance of cotton products, timely identification of pests (flying moths\u2014being a significant threat to cotton crops) helps to protect cotton crops and improve their production and quality. This study proposes real-time detection of Cotton Flying Moths (CFMs) with the assistance of an Internet of Things (IoT)-based system in the agricultural field. The proposed prototype contains a group of sharp infrared sensors, a Zigbee-based communication module, an Arduino 2560 Mega board, a lithium polymer battery (to power the mote), a gateway device, and an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) to respond as a pesticide-sprayer against the detected pest. The proposed pest detection algorithm detects the flying insects\u2019 presence by monitoring variations in the reflected light. Based on this, it sends a detection alert to the gateway device. The gateway device sends detection coordinates to the drone/UAV to respond by spraying pesticide in the detection region. A real testbed and simulation scenarios were implemented to evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed detection system. The results of the testbed implementation suggest the effectiveness of the sensor design and CFM detection. Initial results from the simulation study indicate the suitability of the proposed prototype deployment in the agricultural field. The proposed prototype would not only help minimize the use of pesticides but also maintain the quality and quantity of cotton products. The originality of this study is the custom-made and cost-effective IoT prototype for CFM detection in the agricultural field.",

      "abstract": "The aim of this paper was to propose a method to characterize the ability of a GNSS user to detect a spoofing attack from the behavior of the clock bias. Spoofing interference is not a new issue, especially in military GNSS, although it is a new challenge for civil GNSS, since it is currently implemented and used in many everyday applications. For this reason, it is still a topical issue, especially for receivers that only have access to high-level data (PVT,CN0). To address this important issue, after conducting a study of the receiver clock polarization calculation process, this led to the development of a very basic Matlab model that emulates a spoofing attack at the computational level. Using this model, we were able to observe that the clock bias is affected by the attack. However, the amplitude of this disturbance depends on two factors: the distance between the spoofer and the target and the synchronization between the clock that generates the spoofing signal and the reference clock of the constellation. To validate this observation, more or less synchronized spoofing attacks were carried out on a fixed commercial GNSS receiver with the use of GNSS signal simulators and also with a moving target. We propose then a method to characterize the capacity of detecting a spoofing attack with the clock bias behavior. We present the application of this method for two commercial receivers of the same manufacturer from different generations.",

      "abstract": "Underwater bionic robots are very similar to real underwater creatures in appearance and features. This makes it difficult for autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs) to distinguish their appearance features. Moreover, the existing underwater target detection methods have large model sizes and many parameters. This leads to difficulty in practical application of such UAV methods. To solve this, we propose an underwater camouflaged target recognition algorithm based on an adversarial graph structure. First, the salient features and environmental features of underwater images are fully explored by a custom salient feature extraction network and a related environmental feature extraction network. Second, the camouflaged target graph structure and the natural target graph structure of the fusion environment feature are constructed to obtain the dependency between the target and environment features. Finally, an adaptive frame regression camouflaged target detection network is constructed based on adversarial learning to recognize camouflaged targets and natural targets. In contrast to the existing target recognition model in the simulation of the four datasets of concealed target detection, quantitative underwater image dataset, underwater image enhancement benchmark dataset, and underwater image dataset, the proposed model gets higher average recognition accuracy of 0.820, which is an improvement of 3.4%, and the number of parameters is only 1.2\u00a0m. Proved by the experiments, the proposed target recognition algorithm is more effective and superior to the existing algorithms.",

      "abstract": "In order to study the flight strategies of birds in shear wind and realize the long-range flight of an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV), the aerodynamic performances of a UAV\u2019s airfoil under different shear wind are studied using numerical methods. The results are calculated using the RANS method in shear wind with a linear and logarithmic distribution of velocity. The results show that the slope of the lift curve, the maximum lift coefficient and the stall angle decrease when the velocity gradient is positive or increasing, conversely, they increase at a negative gradient compared to gradient-free wind fields. A positive gradient of wind significantly increased the maximum lift-drag ratio and the effective angle of attack. Compared with linear distributed shear wind with the same velocity at both the lowest and highest points of the flow field, logarithmic distribution decreases the slope of the lift curve, the maximum lift coefficient and the maximum lift-drag ratio and the effective angle of attack. Therefore, a shear wind with a positive gradient is beneficial to the increase of lift-drag ratio and more conducive to cruise flight, and a negative gradient is beneficial for increased lift and more conducive to take-off and landing of UAVs. The velocity distributions influence the aerodynamic performances of the airfoil which is related to the speed and gradient distribution of shear wind.",

      "abstract": "Mobile crowd sensing (MCS) is an attractive and innovation paradigm in which a crowd of users equipped with smart mobile devices conduct sensing tasks by fully exploiting their carried diverse embedded sensors. With the development of robots and Artificial Intelligence, many MCS studies with pervasive machines (Yu et al. Commun ACM 64:76\u201380, 2021) (e.g., unmanned vehicles, drones, etc.) as participants have emerged in recent years. Compared to human participants, robot participants have the advantages of being able to perform dangerous and boring tasks, being highly controlled, and not requiring complex incentive mechanisms. However, participants in previous studies usually have only one type of robot, and the use of heterogeneous robots for collaborative sensing was not considered. Second, previous studies have not considered the vulnerability of robots in realistic environments. In this paper, a multi-agent mobile crowdsensing (MA-MCS) system consisting of multiple heterogeneous robots is proposed to address the above two problems, and the task allocation problem of this system is investigated. To enable the robots to overcome the complex real-world environment, this paper proposes the concept of sense area information map (SAIM) and a self-repairing task allocation algorithm based on the information map. The SAIM can reflect the performance of different robots performing sense tasks in different locations and at different times, and provide guidance for task allocation. The self-repairing task assignment algorithm can be used to repair and reassign tasks after the robot has encountered abnormal situations. Through experiments, it is demonstrated that the SAIM and the map-based self-repairing task allocation algorithm can effectively improve task coverage at the expense of certain energy consumption.",

      "abstract": "In recent years, the autonomous landing of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) has attracted extensive attention due to the widespread applications of UAVs. With the rapid improvements in machine learning and artificial intelligence, recent research has begun to explore deep reinforcement learning (DRL) to learn the landing policy directly from raw observation data. However, current DRL-based solutions tend to suffer poor generalization to unseen environments. To deal with this issue, we formulate the landing problem as a two-stage DRL problem and bootstrap the DRL procedures by augmenting regular DRL loss with an auxiliary localization task. The auxiliary localization task provides dense supervision signals that aid in landing-relevant representation learning. In particular, two marker localization approaches are delicately designed based on deep classification and regression models, and differences between the two configurations are explored, aiming to answer the fundamental question of how to exploit localization better for representation learning. Furthermore, we propose a novel and flexible sampling strategy called Dynamic Partitioned Experience Replay to stabilize and accelerate the training procedure. Experimental results show that the auxiliary localization tasks combined with the improved sampling strategy aid the trained model to generalize in unseen environments. In addition, the trained model can be seamlessly transferred to the real-world quadrotors and has achieved outstanding landing performances.",

In this paper, we focus on the task assignment problem for a UAV swarm saturation attack, in which a deep reinforcement learning (DRL) framework is developed. Specifically, we first construct a mathematical model to formulate the task assignment problem for a UAV swarm saturation attack and consider it as a Markov Decision Process (MDP). We then design a policy neural network using the attention mechanism. We also propose a training algorithm based on the policy gradient method so that our agent can learn an effective task assignment policy. The experimental results have shown that our DRL method can generate high-quality solutions for different problem scales, which meets the requirements of real-time and flexibility in the actual situation.",

      "abstract": "Unmanned Combat Aerial Vehicle (UCAV) path planning is a challenging optimization problem that seeks the optimal or near-optimal flight path for military operations. The problem is further complicated by the need to operate in a complex battlefield environment with minimal military risk and fewer constraints. To address these challenges, highly sophisticated control methods are required, and Swarm Intelligence (SI) algorithms have proven to be one of the most effective approaches. In this context, a study has been conducted to improve the existing Spider Monkey Optimization (SMO) algorithm by integrating a new explorative local search algorithm called Beta-Hill Climbing Optimizer (BHC) into the three main phases of SMO. The result is a novel SMO variant called SMOBHC, which offers improved performance in terms of intensification, exploration, avoiding local minima, and convergence speed. Specifically, BHC is integrated into the main SMO algorithmic structure for three purposes: to improve the new Spider Monkey solution generated in the SMO Local Leader Phase (LLP), to enhance the new Spider Monkey solution produced in the SMO Global Leader Phase (GLP), and to update the positions of all Local Leader members of each local group under a specific condition in the SMO Local Leader Decision (LLD) phase. To demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm, SMOBHC is applied to UCAV path planning in 2D space on three different complex battlefields with ten, thirty, and twenty randomly distributed threats under various conditions. Experimental results show that SMOBHC outperforms the original SMO algorithm and a large set of twenty-six powerful and recent evolutionary algorithms. The proposed method shows better results in terms of the best, worst, mean, and standard deviation outcomes obtained from twenty independent runs on small-scale (D = 30), medium-scale (D = 60), and large-scale (D = 90) battlefields. Statistically, SMOBHC performs better on the three battlefields, except in the case of SMO, where there is no significant difference between them. Overall, the proposed SMO variant significantly improves the obstacle avoidance capability of the SMO algorithm and enhances the stability of the final results. The study provides an effective approach to UCAV path planning that can be useful in military operations with complex battlefield environments.",

      "abstract": "Deep map prediction plays a crucial role in comprehending the three-dimensional structure of a scene, which is essential for enabling mobile robots to navigate autonomously and avoid obstacles in complex environments. However, most existing depth estimation algorithms based on deep neural networks rely heavily on specific datasets, resulting in poor resistance to model interference. To address this issue, this paper proposes and implements an optimized monocular image depth estimation algorithm based on conditional generative adversarial networks. The goal is to overcome the limitations of insufficient training data diversity and overly blurred depth estimation contours in current monocular image depth estimation algorithms based on generative adversarial networks. The proposed algorithm employs an enhanced conditional generative adversarial network model with a generator that adopts a network structure similar to UNet and a novel feature upsampling module. The discriminator uses a multi-layer patchGAN conditional discriminator and incorporates the original depth map as input to effectively utilize prior knowledge. The loss function combines the least squares loss function and the L1 loss function. Compared to traditional depth estimation algorithms, the proposed optimization algorithm can effectively restore image contour information and enhance the visualization capability of depth prediction maps. Experimental results demonstrate that our method can expedite the convergence of the model on NYU-V2 and Make3D datasets, and generate predicted depth maps that contain more details and clearer object contours.",

      "abstract": "This paper investigates the multiple unmanned aerial vehicle (multi-UAV) cooperative task assignment problem. Specifically, we assign different types of UAVs to accomplish the classification, attack, and verification tasks of targets under resource, precedence, and timing constraints. Due to complex coupling among these tasks, we decompose the considered problem into two subproblems: one with continuous and independent tasks and another with continuous and correlative tasks. To solve them, we first present an adjustable, fully adaptive cross-entropy (AFACE) algorithm based on the cross-entropy (CE) method, which serves as a stepping stone for developing other algorithms. Secondly, to overcome task precedence in the first subproblem, we propose a mutually independent AFACE (MIAFACE) algorithm, which converges faster than the CE method when obtaining the optimal scheme vectors of these continuous and independent tasks. Thirdly, to deal with task coupling in the second subproblem, we present a mutually correlative AFACE (MCAFACE) algorithm to find the optimal scheme vectors of these continuous and correlative tasks, while its computational complexity is inferior to that of the MIAFACE algorithm. Finally, numerical simulations demonstrate that the proposed MIAFACE (MCAFACE, respectively) algorithm consumes less time than the existing algorithms for the continuous and independent (correlative, respectively) task assignment problem.",

      "abstract": "Drone/UAV systems are used for the solution of different problems that exist in different fields, in a way that pushes the limits of the human imagination. The services provided by UAV systems are used in the process of many sectors and in daily life. Security is one of the areas UAV systems are used, in line with the historical origin of the system. Undoubtedly, as in every technological innovation, in parallel with the increase in the use of UAV systems for the benefit of humanity, there is also an increase and diversification in illegal activities. Due to the fact that UAV systems offer cheaper, risk-free and cost-effective solutions, there is a global increase in the frequency and diversity of the use of them by terrorist organizations. It would not be an exaggeration that the airspaces, which have been under the sovereignty of states until today and where terrorist organizations did not exist much, are now used by them. Despite the complex and expensive detection, identification, warning and prevention systems that states continue to develop to prevent air threats, the fact that terrorist organizations can carry out attacks with simple and inexpensive UAV systems confirms this determination. Based on the assumption that an UAV-based method can be developed for the solution of the identified problem, in this study an autonomous system has been tried to be developed that can perform control, surveillance and safety flight in a certain airspace, detect intruder systems during flight and lock on them with its software.",

      "abstract": "This study proposes a strategy for improving the thrust performance of fixed-wing UAV turbine engines from the perspective of aircraft/engine integration. In the UAV engine control process, the inlet distortion caused by the angle of attack change is taken into account, the inlet distortion index is calculated in real time by predicting the angle of attack, and the influence of the inlet distortion on the engine model is analyzed mechanically. Then, the pressure ratio command is adjusted according to the new compressor surge margin requirement caused by the inlet distortion to finally improve the engine thrust performance. To verify the effectiveness of the algorithm, an adaptive disturbance rejection controller is designed for the flight control of a fixed-wing UAV to complete the simulation of horizontal acceleration. The simulation results show that, with this strategy, the UAV turbofan engine can improve the turbofan engine thrust performance by more than 8% under the safety conditions.",

      "abstract": "Total phosphorus (TP) concentration is high in countless small inland waterbodies in Hubei province, middle China, which is threating the water environment. However, there are almost no ground-based water quality monitoring points in small inland waterbodies, because the cost of time, labor, and money is high and it does not meet the needs of spatiotemporal dynamic monitoring. Remote sensing provides an effective tool for TP concentration monitoring spatiotemporally. However, monitoring the TP concentration of small inland waterbodies is challenging for satellite remote sensing due to the inadequate spatial resolution. Recently, unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV) have been applied to quantitatively retrieve the spatiotemporal distribution of TP concentration without the challenges of cloud cover and atmospheric effects. Although state-of-the-art algorithms to retrieve TP concentration have been improved, specific models are only used for specific water quality parameters or regions, and there are no robust and reliable TP retrieval models for small inland waterbodies at this time. To address this issue, six machine learning methods optimized by intelligent optimization algorithms (IOA-ML models) have been developed to quantitatively retrieve TP concentration combined with the reflectance of original bands and selected band combinations of UAV multispectral images. We evaluated the performances of models in terms of coefficient of determination (R2), root mean squared error (RMSE), and residual prediction deviation (RPD). The results showed that the R2 of the six IOA-ML models for training, validation, and test sets were 0.8856\u20130.984, 0.8054\u20130.8929, and 0.7462\u20130.9045, respectively, indicating the methods had high precision and transferability. The extreme gradient boosting optimized by genetic algorithm (GA-XGB) performed best, with the highest precision for the validation and test sets. The spatial distribution of TP concentration of each flight derived from different models had similar distribution characteristics. This paper provides a reference for promoting the intelligent and automatic level of water environment monitoring in small inland waterbodies.",

      "abstract": "Forest fires are among the most critical natural tragedies threatening forest lands and resources. The accurate and early detection of forest fires is essential to reduce losses and improve firefighting. Conventional firefighting techniques, based on ground inspection and limited by the field-of-view, lead to insufficient monitoring capabilities for large areas. Recently, due to their excellent flexibility and ability to cover large regions, unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) have been used to combat forest fire incidents. An essential step for an autonomous system that monitors fire situations is first to locate the fire in a video. State-of-the-art forest-fire segmentation methods based on vision transformers (ViTs) and convolutional neural networks (CNNs) use a single aerial image. Nevertheless, fire has an inconsistent scale and form, and small fires from long-distance cameras lack salient features, so accurate fire segmentation from a single image has been challenging. In addition, the techniques based on CNNs treat all image pixels equally and overlook global information, limiting their performance, while ViT-based methods suffer from high computational overhead. To address these issues, we proposed a spatiotemporal architecture called FFS-UNet, which exploited temporal information for forest-fire segmentation by combining a transformer into a modified lightweight UNet model. First, we extracted a keyframe and two reference frames using three different encoder paths in parallel to obtain shallow features and perform feature fusion. Then, we used a transformer to perform deep temporal-feature extraction, which enhanced the feature learning of the fire pixels and made the feature extraction more robust. Finally, we combined the shallow features of the keyframe for de-convolution in the decoder path via skip-connections to segment the fire. We evaluated empirical outcomes on the UAV-collected video and Corsican Fire datasets. The proposed FFS-UNet demonstrated enhanced performance with fewer parameters by achieving an F1-score of 95.1% and an IoU of 86.8% on the UAV-collected video, and an F1-score of 91.4% and an IoU of 84.8% on the Corsican Fire dataset, which were higher than previous forest fire techniques. Therefore, the suggested FFS-UNet model effectively resolved fire-monitoring issues with UAVs.",

      "abstract": "Autonomous delivery by aerial robots inside urban environments is getting closer to be operational everyday, but several concerns about proper navigation sources are to be addressed. As lot of GPS glitches are observed in urban environments, hereon a fully vision-based navigation framework is developed. The platform is assumed to have the ability to get into a vicinity of its destination using available \u201cimperfect\u201d navigation methods like GPS. Hereupon, the autonomous execution of mission is divided into four consecutive phases, all relying on a forward-looking camera: I) A novel vision-based method for detecting and confirming the target facade in the batch of neighboring buildings is introduced that performs matching using neural networks exploiting the texture features of facade segments; II) The intended window among the facade windows array is detected in real-time; III) The robot is guided to autonomously approach the intended window by a proper visual tracking algorithm; IV) Finally, a collision-free passage through the portal section of window based on visual Time-To-Contact estimation is commanded for the safe entrance. The network is trained using approximately 34,000 feature samples from a set of real-world building facades. As a result, a 95.4% accuracy along with 81.4% classification precision and 87.6% recall are achieved for the trained network in correct facade detection and confirmation. Also, the success rate of overall entrance mission is found to be 13 out of 15 in real world experiments, provided the initial distance being less than 20 meters.",

      "abstract": "Activity recognition in unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) surveillance is addressed in various computer vision applications such as image retrieval, pose estimation, object detection, object detection in videos, object detection in still images, object detection in video frames, face recognition, and video action recognition. In the UAV-based surveillance technology, video segments captured from aerial vehicles make it challenging to recognize and distinguish human behavior. In this research, to recognize a single and multi-human activity using aerial data, a hybrid model of histogram of oriented gradient (HOG), mask-regional convolutional neural network (Mask-RCNN), and bidirectional long short-term memory (Bi-LSTM) is employed. The HOG algorithm extracts patterns, Mask-RCNN extracts feature maps from the raw aerial image data, and the Bi-LSTM network exploits the temporal relationship between the frames for the underlying action in the scene. This Bi-LSTM network reduces the error rate to the greatest extent due to its bidirectional process. This novel architecture generates enhanced segmentation by utilizing the histogram gradient-based instance segmentation and improves the accuracy of classifying human activities using the Bi-LSTM approach. Experimental outcomes demonstrate that the proposed model outperforms the other state-of-the-art models and has achieved 99.25% accuracy on the YouTube-Aerial dataset.",

      "abstract": "Purpose: Digital whole slide imaging allows pathologists to view slides on a computer screen instead of under a microscope. Digital viewing allows for real-time monitoring of pathologists\u2019 search behavior and neurophysiological responses during the diagnostic process. One particular neurophysiological measure, pupil diameter, could provide a basis for evaluating clinical competence during training or developing tools that support the diagnostic process. Prior research shows that pupil diameter is sensitive to cognitive load and arousal, and it switches between exploration and exploitation of a visual image. Different categories of lesions in pathology pose different levels of challenge, as indicated by diagnostic disagreement among pathologists. If pupil diameter is sensitive to the perceived difficulty in diagnosing biopsies, eye-tracking could potentially be used to identify biopsies that may benefit from a second opinion.Approach: We measured case onset baseline-corrected (phasic) and uncorrected (tonic) pupil diameter in 90 pathologists who each viewed and diagnosed 14 digital breast biopsy cases that cover the diagnostic spectrum from benign to invasive breast cancer. Pupil data were extracted from the beginning of viewing and interpreting of each individual case. After removing 122 trials (<10 % ) with poor eye-tracking quality, 1138 trials remained. We used multiple linear regression with robust standard error estimates to account for dependent observations within pathologists.Results: We found a positive association between the magnitude of phasic dilation and subject-centered difficulty ratings and between the magnitude of tonic dilation and untransformed difficulty ratings. When controlling for case diagnostic category, only the tonic-difficulty relationship persisted.Conclusions: Results suggest that tonic pupil dilation may indicate overall arousal differences between pathologists as they interpret biopsy cases and could signal a need for additional training, experience, or automated decision aids. Phasic dilation is sensitive to characteristics of biopsies that tend to elicit higher difficulty ratings and could indicate a need for a second opinion.",

      "abstract": "The swift development of autonomous vehicles raises the necessity of semantically mapping the environment by producing distinguishable representations to recognise similar areas. To this end, in this article, we present an efficient technique to cut up a robot\u2019s trajectory into semantically consistent communities based on graph-inspired descriptors. This allows an agent to localise itself in future tasks under different environmental circumstances in an urban area. The proposed semantic grouping technique utilizes the Leiden Community Detection Algorithm (LeCDA), which is a novel and efficient method of low computational complexity and exploits semantic and topometric information from the observed scenes. The presented experimentation was carried out on a novel dataset from the city of Xanthi, Greece (dubbed as\u00a0Gryphonurban\u00a0urban dataset), which was recorded by RGB-D, IMU and GNSS sensors mounted on a moving vehicle. Our results exhibit the formulation of a semantic map with visually coherent communities and the realisation of an effective localisation mechanism for autonomous vehicles in urban environments.",

      "abstract": "Fog-based vehicular communication has received a huge interest due to rise in vehicular traffic and numerous services, like transferring messages among vehicles in an emergency and other scenarios. Secure storage, password protection, authorization, accessibility, and an authentic summary of the data flow are required in existing centralized approach. Conventional approaches process data at the servers, which affects network latency and throughput. Transferring data from edge devices to a centralized server increases the risk of being hacked, which results in corrupted data and data destruction. Nonetheless, conventional fog-based protocols are susceptible to various threats and proved inefficient in terms of computation and communication cost. In this article, we propose a secure and robust authentication protocol for fog-based vehicular communication. Moreover, the formal security verification using Random Oracle Model and commonly used software, Automated Validation of Internet Security Protocols and Applications and informal analysis represent that our proposed protocol is secure against man-in-the-middle and replay attacks. The performance comparison shows that the protocol addresses added security features with the least possible latency, computation, communication, and storage cost compared to the state-of-the-art protocols. As a result, our proposed protocol\u2019s high-security features indicate its robustness and make it feasible for practical application.",

      "abstract": "Steam mopping is an eco-friendly solution for cleaning and disinfecting floors, avoiding harsh chemicals or harmful UV lights. Currently, commercial steam mopping systems are manually operated, which is laborious and unsafe. This work presents the design methodology of a novel, eco-friendly autonomous steam mopping robot named \u2018Snail\u2019 for cleaning and disinfecting typical indoor floors, namely tile, carpet, concrete, vinyl, sealed wood, and rugs. Our work is mainly focused on (1) the mechanical system design, including the locomotion, steam dispenser, and mopping unit, (2) the hardware and software architecture, and (3) the motion control system\u2019s design for smooth maneuverability and mitigating friction forces. A high-gain friction estimator is proposed, whose output is exploited by the motion controller to follow the desired path and compensate for the traction-based locomotion disturbances due to extensive mop contact with a rough-textured floor, such as carpet. The proposed autonomous steam mopping robot\u2019s efficiency is validated with different floors with zig-zagging cleaning patterns, setting a minimum of 100 \u00b0C as the disinfecting steam criterion. Using the proposed motion control algorithm, we validate the smooth maneuverability, assuring the robot traverses with a given speed and follows the trajectory even on a rough carpeted floor. The cleaning efficiency is tested by removing hard stains, consuming less water, and faster wet floor drying. The robot used only one liter of water to clean a 5\u00a0m2\u00a0floor area, and the drying time was found to be four times faster than normal water mopping. The proposed steam mopping robot design is ideal for cleaning and disinfecting hospitals and eldercare centers, where hygiene is crucial, and promoting going green, avoiding harsh chemicals, and mitigating current cleaner labor concerns, including the risk of infection.",

      "abstract": "The Connected Automated Vehicle (CAV)\u2019s deployment is proof of the wide evolution of autonomous driving technologies enabling vehicles to gradually dispose of their drivers. Within the scope of smart cities, such innovation has given rise to a new type of CAV: the Automated City Shuttle (ACS). Foreseen as the new paradigm aiming to shape the public transport model, the ACS elicits a plurality of new applications, such as the on-demand service in which a driverless shuttle offers the desired ride without human intervention. However, such a model raises cybersecurity concerns through the numerous attack surfaces and vehicle hyperconnection. This phenomenon was highlighted in several studies on CAVs, but very few research works tackled the specific case of ACSs, whose challenges and risks far exceed those of personal vehicles. The present work offers a comprehensive investigation of cybersecurity attacks, demonstrates a performed risk assessment based on the ISO/SAE 21434 standard, and showcases a penetration test over a real ACS of automation level four (L4) according to the Society of Automotive Engineering (SAE)\u2019s ranking. Based on our experiments, we leverage fundamental cybersecurity recommendations with a focus on the ACS\u2019s physical security.",

      "abstract": "Die Erfassung des Ern\u00e4hrungsstatus von Intensivpatient:innen wird in aktuellen Leitlinien empfohlen und sollte die Beurteilung des Muskelstatus beinhalten. Eine geeignete apparative Methode stellt die Analyse von Routinecomputertomographien (CT), die gerade bei kritisch Kranken h\u00e4ufig durchgef\u00fchrt werden, dar. Mithilfe spezieller Softwares werden einzelne CT-Schichten bearbeitet und verschiedene Parameter, wie Muskelfl\u00e4che, Muskeldichte oder der Fettgewebeanteil, dargestellt und quantifiziert. Es konnte gezeigt werden, dass die Erfassung des Skelettmuskulaturquerschnitts im Bereich der Lendenwirbels\u00e4ule sehr gut mit der Gesamtk\u00f6rpermuskulatur korreliert. Es gibt definierte, wenn auch populationsabh\u00e4ngige, Cut-off-Werte, mit deren Hilfe die Diagnose einer Sarkopenie gestellt werden kann. Die \u00dcberpr\u00fcfung einer individuellen Ern\u00e4hrungstherapie kann durch Beurteilung repetitiver CT-Untersuchungen erfolgen. Die stetig wachsende Datenlage best\u00e4tigt, dass das Verfahren in der Intensivmedizin einen wertvollen Beitrag zur Erhebung der K\u00f6rperzusammensetzung liefern kann. Die meisten der aktuell verf\u00fcgbaren Softwares erfordern eine zeitaufwendige Bearbeitung der CT. Mittlerweile vereinzelt verf\u00fcgbare automatisierte Programme, die den Gro\u00dfteil der manuellen Bearbeitung \u00fcberfl\u00fcssig machen, k\u00f6nnten in Zukunft die Methode noch attraktiver machen. Das Risiko eines Intensivtransports zur CT bzw. die Strahlenbelastung k\u00f6nnen grunds\u00e4tzlich nur bei sicherer medizinischer Indikation f\u00fcr eine CT gerechtfertigt werden. Eine verf\u00fcgbare CT sollte beim Intensivpatienten auch zur Analyse der K\u00f6rperzusammensetzung genutzt werden.",

      "abstract": "Salt marshes are one of the most productive ecosystems and provide numerous ecosystem services. However, they are seriously threatened by human activities and sea level rise. One of the main characteristics of this environment is the distribution of specialized plant species. The environmental conditions governing the distribution of this vegetation, as well as its variation over time and space, still need to be better understood. In this way, these ecosystems will be managed and protected more effectively. Low-altitude remote sensing techniques are excellent for rapidly assessing salt marsh vegetation coverage. By applying a high-resolution hyperspectral imaging system onboard a UAV (UAV-HS), this study aims to differentiate between plant species and determine their distribution in salt marshes, using the salt marshes of Cadiz Bay as a case study. Hyperspectral processing techniques were used to find the purest spectral signature of each species. Continuum removal and second derivative transformations of the original spectral signatures highlight species-specific spectral absorption features. Using these methods, it is possible to differentiate salt marsh plant species with adequate precision. The elevation range occupied by these species was also estimated. Two species of Sarcocornia spp. were identified on the Cadiz Bay salt marsh, along with a class for Sporobolus maritimus. An additional class represents the transition areas from low to medium marsh with different proportions of Sarcocornia spp. and S. maritimus. S. maritimus can be successfully distinguished from soil containing microphytobenthos. The final species distribution map has up to 96% accuracy, with 43.5% of the area occupied by medium marsh species (i.e., Sarcocornia spp.) in the 2.30\u20132.80 m elevation range, a 29% transitional zone covering in 1.91\u20132.78 m, and 25% covered by S. maritims (1.22\u20132.35 m). Basing a method to assess the vulnerability of the marsh to SLR scenarios on the relationship between elevation and species distribution would allow prioritizing areas for rehabilitation. UAV-HS techniques have the advantage of being easily customizable and easy to execute (e.g., following extreme events or taking regular measurements). The UAV-HS data is expected to improve our understanding of coastal ecosystem responses, as well as increase our capacity to detect small changes in plant species distribution through monitoring.",

      "abstract": "Unmanned aerial vehicles, drones, and internet of things (IoT) based devices have acquired significant traction due to their enhanced usefulness. The primary use is aerial surveying of restricted or inaccessible locations. Based on the aforementioned aspects, the current study provides a method based on blockchain technology for ensuring the safety and confidentiality of data collected by virtual circuit-based devices. To test the efficacy of the suggested technique, an IoT-based application is integrated with a simulated vehicle monitoring system. Pentatope-based elliptic curve encryption and secure hash algorithm (SHA) are employed to provide anonymity in data storage. The cloud platform stores technical information, authentication, integrity, and vehicular responses. Additionally, the Ethbalance MetaMask wallet is used for BCN-based transactions. Conspicuously, the suggested technique aids in the prevention of several attacks, including plaintext attacks and ciphertext attacks, on sensitive information. When compared to the state-of-the-art techniques, the outcomes demonstrate the effectiveness and safety of the suggested method in terms of operational cost (2.95 units), scalability (14.98 units), reliability (96.07%), and stability (0.82).",

However, as happens for many physical devices, they can present some misalignment between the real value and the registered one. These systematic or occasional errors can derive from different sources and could be related to the sensor itself or to external noise due to the place where it is located. Hardware calibration requires special equipment, which is not always available. In any case, even if possible, it can be used to solve the physical problem and sometimes requires removing the sensor from its location, which is not always feasible. At the same time, solving the problem of external noise usually requires software procedures. Moreover, as reported in the literature, even two IMUs from the same brand and the same production chain could produce different measurements under identical conditions. This paper proposes a soft calibration procedure to reduce the misalignment created by systematic errors and noise based on the grayscale or RGB camera built-in on the drone. Based on the transformer neural network architecture trained in a supervised learning fashion on pairs of short videos shot by the UAV\u2019s camera and the correspondent UAV measurements, the strategy does not require any special equipment. It is easily reproducible and could be used to increase the trajectory accuracy of the UAV during the flight.",

      "abstract": "The decline of terrestrial predator populations across the globe is altering top-down pressures that drive predator\u2013prey interactions. However, a knowledge gap remains in understanding how removing terrestrial predators affects prey behavior. Using a bifactorial playback experiment, we exposed fox squirrels to predator (red-tailed hawks, coyotes, dogs) and non-predator control (Carolina wren) calls inside terrestrial predator exclosures, accessible to avian predators, and in control areas subject to ambient predation risk. Fox squirrels increased their use of terrestrial predator exclosures, a pattern that corresponded with 3&nbsp;years of camera trapping. Our findings suggest fox squirrels recognized that exclosures had predictably lower predation risk. However, exclosures had no effect on their immediate behavioral response towards any call, and fox squirrels responded most severely to hawk predator calls. This study shows that anthropogenically driven predator loss creates predictably safer areas (refugia) that prey respond to proactively with increased use. However, the persistence of a lethal avian predator is sufficient to retain a reactive antipredator response towards an immediate predation threat. Some prey may benefit from shifting predator\u2013prey interactions by gaining refugia without sacrificing a sufficient response towards potential predators.",

      "abstract": "Brazil has 95 million tons of Li reserves in the form of pegmatites but produces less than 1% of the global output. Historically Li production in Brazil has been low due to governmental restrictions aimed at controlling the exploitation and trade of Li in Brazil. However, as of 2022, these restrictions were revoked. The abundance of untapped pegmatite ores in Brazil complements the soaring demand for Li in energy-storage applications. This study performs process mineralogy studies on 10 samples collected from a Li pegmatite deposit in the southeastern region of Minas Gerais in Brazil. The samples were characterized by combining density separation and SEM-based automated mineralogy processing system allied with XRF, ICP OES, XRD, and LA\u2013ICPMS. The latter was used to determine Li content in micas which allowed determining the Li deportment between Li-bearing minerals. The results show that the samples contain such Li-bearing minerals as muscovite (0.5 wt% Li2O) and lepidolite (3.1 wt% Li2O), in addition to spodumene (8.0 wt% Li2O). According to the characterization of the spodumene concentrate (d = 3.11) by density separation (at d = 2.95), two main trends were observed: (a) low Li deportment in the sink product (approximately 44% wt%) and higher Li2O grade (approximately 6.5 wt%), and (b) higher Li deportment in the sink product (58%) and lower Li2O content (approximately 4.9 wt%). The first trend is associated with higher modal content of mica since it carries Li to the light product. Lower Li grade is related to the presence of Fe-bearing minerals (e.g., epidote and amphibole) as they report to the dense product and do not contain Li. Spodumene has a high degree of liberation in all samples; therefore, it did not influence the deportment results. The findings highlight the benefit of combining scanning electron microscopy-based automated mineralogy with LA\u2013ICPMS and other techniques from process mineralogy studies in mineral processing. In addition to the mineralogy and liberation characteristics, identifying Li-bearing minerals and determining Li deportment is crucial.",

      "abstract": "Hypervirulent Klebsiella pneumoniae (hvKp) is a new emerging variant of K. pneumoniae that is increasingly reported worldwide. The variant hvKp is known to cause severe invasive community-acquired infections such as metastatic meningitis, pyogenic liver abscesses (PLA) and endophthalmitis, but its role in hospital-acquired infections (HAIs) is little known. The aim of this study was to evaluate the prevalence of hvKp among hospital-acquired (HA) K. pneumoniae infections in the intensive care unit (ICU) and to compare between hvKp and classical K. pneumoniae (cKP) regarding antimicrobial resistance pattern, virulence and molecular characteristics. The study was cross-sectional and included 120 ICU patients suffering from HA K. pneumoniae infections between January and September 2022. K. pneumoniae isolates were subjected to antimicrobial susceptibility testing and detection of extended-spectrum-\u03b2-lactamase (ESBL) production by the Phoenix 100 automated microbiology system, string test, biofilm formation, serum resistance assay, and detection of virulence-associated genes (rmpA, rmpA2, magA, iucA) and capsular serotype-specific genes (K1, K2, K5, K20, K57) by polymerase chain reaction (PCR). Of 120 K. pneumoniae isolates, 19 (15.8%) were hvKp. The hypermucoviscous phenotype was more significantly detected in the hvKp group than in the cKP group (100% vs. 7.9%, p \u2264 0.001). The rate of resistance to different antimicrobial agents was significantly higher in the cKP group than that in the hvKp group. Fifty-three strains were identified as ESBL-producing strains, which was more frequent in the cKP group than in the hvKp group (48/101 [47.5%] vs. 5/19 [26.3%], respectively, p \u2264 0.001). The hvKP isolates were highly associated with moderate and strong biofilm formation than cKP isolates (p = 0.018 and p = 0.043 respectively). Moreover, the hvKP isolates were highly associated with intermediate sensitivity and re sistance to serum in the serum resistance assay (p = 0.043 and p = 0.016 respectively). K1, K2, rmpA, rmpA2, magA and iucA genes were significantly associated with hvKp (p \u2264 0.001, 0.004, <0.001, <0.001, 0.037 and <0.001, respectively). However, K5, K20 and K57 were not associated with hvKp. The hvKp strains have emerged as a new threat to ICU patients because of their ability to cause more severe and life-threatening infections than cKP. The string test alone as a laboratory test for screening of hvKp has become insufficient. Recently, hvKp was defined as hypermucoviscous- and aerobactin-positive. It is important to improve the awareness towards the diagnosis and management of hvKp infections.",

      "abstract": "Vehicle trajectory prediction is an important decision-making and planning basis for autonomous driving systems that enables them to drive safely and efficiently. To accurately predict vehicle trajectories, the complex representations and dynamic interactions among the elements in a traffic scene are abstracted and modelled. This paper presents vehicle\u2013road relationships net, a deep learning network that extracts features from vehicle\u2013road relationships and models the effects of traffic environments on vehicles. The introduction of geographic highway information and the calculation of spatiotemporal distances with a reference not only unify heterogeneous vehicle\u2013road relationship representations into a time series vector but also reduce the requirement for sensing transient changes in the surrounding area. A hierarchical long short-term memory network extracts environmental features from two perspectives\u2014social interactions and road constraints\u2014and predicts the future trajectories of vehicles by their manoeuvre categories. Accordingly, vehicle\u2013road relationships net fully exploits the contributions of historical trajectories and integrates the effects of road constraints to achieve performance that is comparable to or better than that of state-of-the-art methods on the next-generation simulation dataset.",

      "abstract": "Small unmanned aerial vehicles are a threat for manned aviation. Their increased use by hobby pilots and within the commercial sector has been accompanied by an increase in incidents involving manned aircraft. The problem is that current aircraft structures are designed to resist collisions with birds. They are not designed to withstand drone impacts. The composition of drones differs significantly from previously known load cases. Drones consist of several components with various materials. This means, that there is no analytic model to determine the impact force of such drone strikes with aircraft structures. Within this work, a novel reduced order model for drone impacts is developed. It is validated with high velocity impact test data and explicit finite element simulations. The impact of fragmenting components of the drone are modelled with the aircraft impact model. The impact of non-fragmenting components like motors are described with a spring-mass model. The results show that the approach of superimposing a spring-mass model with the aircraft impact model leads to good results. In case of a rigid target only minor deviations occur within the validity range of the model. Damage and degradation of the target is not included in the model what leads to larger deviations in case of an impact with deformable structures. Nevertheless, the model is very well suited for rapid load estimation and can qualitatively reproduce contact force curves. It can be used for preliminary design of aircraft structures without conducting time and cost intensive tests and simulations.",

To this end, we consider separate microcephaly-related compartments for affected infants, as well as the role of asymptomatic carriers, the influence of seasonality and transmission through sexual contact. We determine the basic reproduction number of the corresponding time-dependent model and time-constant model and study the dependence of this value on the mosquito-related parameters. In addition, we demonstrate the global stability of the disease-free periodic solution if R0<1, whereas the disease persists when R0>1. We fit our model to data from Colombia between 2015 and 2017 as a case study. The fitting is used to figure out how sexual transmission affects the number of cases among women as well as the number of microcephaly cases. Our sensitivity analyses conclude that the most effective ways to prevent Zika-related microcephaly cases are preventing mosquito bites and controlling mosquito populations, as well as providing protection during sexual contact.",

      "abstract": "Complete autonomous systems such as self-driving cars to ensure the high reliability and safety of humans need the most efficient combination of four-dimensional (4D) detection, exact localization, and artificial intelligent (AI) networking to establish a fully automated smart transportation system. At present, multiple integrated sensors such as light detection and ranging (LiDAR), radio detection and ranging (RADAR), and car cameras are frequently used for object detection and localization in the conventional autonomous transportation system. Moreover, the global positioning system (GPS) is used for the positioning of autonomous vehicles (AV). These individual systems\u2019 detection, localization, and positioning efficiency are insufficient for AV systems. In addition, they do not have any reliable networking system for self-driving cars carrying us and goods on the road. Although the sensor fusion technology of car sensors came up with good efficiency for detection and location, the proposed convolutional neural networking approach will assist to achieve a higher accuracy of 4D detection, precise localization, and real-time positioning. Moreover, this work will establish a strong AI network for AV far monitoring and data transmission systems. The proposed networking system efficiency remains the same on under-sky highways as well in various tunnel roads where GPS does not work properly. For the first time, modified traffic surveillance cameras have been exploited in this conceptual paper as an external image source for AV and anchor sensing nodes to complete AI networking transportation systems. This work approaches a model that solves AVs\u2019 fundamental detection, localization, positioning, and networking challenges with advanced image processing, sensor fusion, feathers matching, and AI networking technology. This paper also provides an experienced AI driver concept for a smart transportation system with deep learning technology.",

      "abstract": "There is no doubt that the autonomous vehicle is an important developing direction of the auto industry, and, thus, more and more scholars are paying attention to doing more research in this field. Since path planning plays a key role in the operation of autonomous vehicles, scholars attach great importance to this field. Although it has been applied in many fields, there are still some problems, such as low efficiency of path planning and collision risk during driving. In order to solve these problems, an automotive vehicle-based rapid exploration random tree (AV-RRT)-based non-particle path planning method for autonomous vehicles is proposed. On the premise of ensuring safety and meeting the requirements of the vehicle\u2019s kinematic constraints through the expansion of obstacles, the dynamic step size is used for random tree growth. A non-particle collision detection (NPCD) collision detection algorithm and path modification (PM) path modification strategy are proposed for the collision risk in the turning process, and geometric constraints are used to represent the possible security threats, so as to improve the efficiency and safety of vehicle global path driving and to provide reference for the research of driverless vehicles.",

      "abstract": "Nowadays, Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) devices and their services and applications are gaining popularity and attracting considerable attention in different fields of our daily life. Nevertheless, most of these applications and services require more powerful computational resources and energy, and their limited battery capacity and processing power make it difficult to run them on a single device. Edge-Cloud Computing (ECC) is emerging as a new paradigm to cope with the challenges of these applications, which moves computing resources to the edge of the network and remote cloud, thereby alleviating the overhead through task offloading. Even though ECC offers substantial benefits for these devices, the limited bandwidth condition in the case of simultaneous offloading via the same channel with increasing data transmission of these applications has not been adequately addressed. Moreover, protecting the data through transmission remains a significant concern that still needs to be addressed. Therefore, in this paper, to bypass the limited bandwidth and address the potential security threats challenge, a new compression, security, and energy-aware task offloading framework is proposed for the ECC system environment. Specifically, we first introduce an efficient layer of compression to smartly reduce the transmission data over the channel. In addition, to address the security issue, a new layer of security based on an Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) cryptographic technique is presented to protect offloaded and sensitive data from different vulnerabilities. Subsequently, task offloading, data compression, and security are jointly formulated as a mixed integer problem whose objective is to reduce the overall energy of the system under latency constraints. Finally, simulation results reveal that our model is scalable and can cause a significant reduction in energy consumption (i.e., 19%, 18%, 21%, 14.5%, 13.1% and 12%) with respect to other benchmarks (i.e., local, edge, cloud and further benchmark models).",

      "abstract": "With the aim of improving the image quality of the crucial components of transmission lines taken by unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV), a priori work on the defective fault location of high-voltage transmission lines has attracted great attention from researchers in the UAV field. In recent years, generative adversarial nets (GAN) have achieved good results in image generation tasks. However, the generation of high-resolution images with rich semantic details from complex backgrounds is still challenging. Therefore, we propose a novel GANs-based image generation model to be used for the critical components of power lines. However, to solve the problems related to image backgrounds in public data sets, considering that the image background of the common data set CPLID (Chinese Power Line Insulator Dataset) is simple. However, it cannot fully reflect the complex environments of transmission line images; therefore, we established an image data set named \u201cKCIGD\u201d (The Key Component Image Generation Dataset), which can be used for model training. CFM-GAN (GAN networks based on coarse\u2013fine-grained generators and multiscale discriminators) can generate the images of the critical components of transmission lines with rich semantic details and high resolutions. CFM-GAN can provide high-quality image inputs for transmission line fault detection and line inspection models to guarantee the safe operation of power systems. Additionally, we can use these high-quality images to expand the data set. In addition, CFM-GAN consists of two generators and multiple discriminators, which can be flexibly applied to image generation tasks in other scenarios. We introduce a penalty mechanism-related Monte Carlo search (MCS) approach in the CFM-GAN model to introduce more semantic details in the generated images. Moreover, we presented a multiscale discriminator structure according to the multitask learning mechanisms to effectively enhance the quality of the generated images. Eventually, the experiments using the CFM-GAN model on the KCIGD dataset and the publicly available CPLID indicated that the model used in this work outperformed existing mainstream models in improving image resolution and quality.",

      "abstract": "This research paper reviews the potential of smart contracts for responsible AI with a focus on frameworks, hardware, energy efficiency, and cyberattacks. Smart contracts are digital agreements that are executed by a blockchain, and they have the potential to revolutionize the way we conduct business by increasing transparency and trust. When it comes to responsible AI systems, smart contracts can play a crucial role in ensuring that the terms and conditions of the contract are fair and transparent as well as that any automated decision-making is explainable and auditable. Furthermore, the energy consumption of blockchain networks has been a matter of concern; this article explores the energy efficiency element of smart contracts. Energy efficiency in smart contracts may be enhanced by the use of techniques such as off-chain processing and sharding. The study emphasises the need for careful auditing and testing of smart contract code in order to protect against cyberattacks along with the use of secure libraries and frameworks to lessen the likelihood of smart contract vulnerabilities.",

      "abstract": "This paper puts forward a novel design for an airspeed instrument aimed at small fixed-wing tail-sitter unmanned aerial vehicles. The working principle is to relate the power spectra of the wall-pressure fluctuations beneath the turbulent boundary layer present over the vehicle\u2019s body in flight to its airspeed. The instrument consists of two microphones; one flush-mounted on the vehicle\u2019s nose cone, which captures the pseudo-sound caused by the turbulent boundary layer, and a micro-controller that processes the signals and computes the airspeed. A feed-forward single-layer neural network is used to predict the airspeed based on the power spectra of the microphones\u2019 signals. The neural network is trained using data obtained from wind tunnel and flight experiments. Several neural networks were trained and validated using only flight data, with the best one achieving a mean approximation error of 0.043 m/s and having a standard deviation of 1.039 m/s. The angle of attack has a significant impact on the measurement, but if the angle of attack is known, the airspeed could still be successfully predicted for a wide range of angles of attack.",

The dangerous and wasteful effects are substantial, and the probability of attacks is very high. Therefore, an anomaly detection and protection system are needed. This paper aims to design and implement an intelligent anomaly detection system for the security of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs)/drones. The proposed system is heavily based on utilizing ICMetric technology to exploit low-level device features for detection. This technology extracts the accelerometer and gyroscope sensors\u2019 bias to create a unique number known as the ICMetric number. Hence, ICMetric numbers represent additional features integrated into the dataset used to detect drones. This study performs the classification using a deep neural network (DNN). The experimental results prove that the proposed system achieves high levels of detection and performance metrics.",

      "abstract": "In the event of a radiological or nuclear accident, or when physical dosimetry is not available, the scoring of radiation-induced chromosomal aberrations in lymphocytes constitutes an essential tool for the estimation of the absorbed dose of the exposed individual and for effective triage. Cytogenetic biodosimetry employs different cytogenetic assays including the scoring of dicentrics, micronuclei, and translocations as well as analyses of induced premature chromosome condensation to define the frequency of chromosome aberrations. However, inherent challenges using these techniques include the considerable time span from sampling to result, the sensitivity and specificity of the various techniques, and the requirement of highly skilled personnel. Thus, techniques that obviate these challenges are needed. The introduction of telomere and centromere (TC) staining have successfully met these challenges and, in addition, greatly improved the efficiency of cytogenetic biodosimetry through the development of automated approaches, thus reducing the need for specialized personnel. Here, we review the role of the various cytogenetic dosimeters and their recent improvements in the management of populations exposed to genotoxic agents such as ionizing radiation. Finally, we discuss the emerging potentials to exploit these techniques in a wider spectrum of medical and biological applications, e.g., in cancer biology to identify prognostic biomarkers for the optimal triage and treatment of patients.",

      "abstract": "In recent years, the overall performances of inertial Micro-Electro Mechanical Sensors (MEMSs) exhibited substantial improvements to values very close or similar to so-called tactical-grade sensors. However, due to their high costs, numerous researchers are currently focusing on the performance enhancement of cheap consumer-grade MEMS inertial sensors for all those applications (as an example, small unmanned aerial vehicles, UAVs), where cost effectiveness is a relevant request; the use of redundancy proves to be a feasible method for this purpose. In this regard, the authors propose, hereinafter, a suitable strategy aimed at fusing raw measurements provided by multiple inertial sensors mounted on a 3D-printed structure. In particular, accelerations and angular rates measured by the sensors are averaged according to weights associated with the results of an Allan variance approach; the lower the noise figure of the sensors, the greater their weight on the final averaged values. On the other hand, possible effects on the measurements due to the use of a 3D structure in reinforced ONYX (a material capable of providing better mechanical specifications for avionic applications with respect to other solutions for additive manufacturing) were evaluated. The performance of a prototype implementing the considered strategy is compared with that of a tactical-grade inertial measurement unit in stationary conditions, exhibiting differences as low as 0.3 degrees in heading measurements. Moreover, the reinforced ONYX structure does not significantly affect the measured values in terms of both thermal and magnetic field while assuring better mechanical characteristics with respect to other 3D printing materials, thanks to a tensile strength of about 250 MPa and a specific stacking sequence of continuous fibers. Finally, a test conducted on an actual UAV highlights performance very close to that of a reference unit, with root-mean-square error in heading measurements as low as 0.3 degrees in observation intervals up to 140 s.",

      "abstract": "Waterline usually plays as an important visual cue for the autonomous navigation of marine unmanned surface vehicles (USVs) in specific waters. However, the visual complexity of the inland waterline presents a significant challenge for the development of highly efficient computer vision algorithms tailored for waterline detection in a complicated inland water environment that marine USVs face. This paper attempts to find a solution to guarantee the effectiveness of waterline detection for the USVs with a general digital camera patrolling variable inland waters. To this end, a general deep-learning-based paradigm for inland marine USVs, named DeepWL, is proposed, which consists of two cooperative deep models (termed WLdetectNet and WLgenerateNet, respectively). They afford a continuous waterline image-map estimation from a single video stream captured on board. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness and superiority of the proposed approach via qualitative and quantitative assessment on the concerned performances. Moreover, due to its own generality, the proposed approach has the potential to be applied to the waterline detection tasks of other water areas such as coastal waters.",

      "abstract": "Modeling and controlling highly nonlinear, multivariable, unstable, coupled and underactuated systems are challenging problems to which a unique solution does not exist. Modeling and control of Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) with four rotors fall into that category of problems. In this paper, a nonlinear quadrotor UAV dynamical model is developed with the Newton\u2013Euler method, and a control architecture is proposed for 3D trajectory tracking. The controller design is decoupled into two parts: an inner loop for attitude stabilization and an outer loop for trajectory tracking. A few attitude stabilization methods are discussed, implemented and compared, considering the following control approaches: Proportional\u2013Integral\u2013Derivative (PID), Linear\u2013Quadratic Regulator (LQR), Model Predictive Control (MPC), Feedback Linearization (FL) and Sliding Mode Control (SMC). This paper is intended to serve as a guideline work for selecting quadcopters\u2019 control strategies, both in terms of quantitative and qualitative considerations. PID and LQR controllers are designed, exploiting the model linearized about the hovering condition, while MPC, FL and SMC directly exploit the nonlinear model, with minor simplifications. The fast dynamics ensured by the SMC-based controller together with its robustness and the limited estimated command effort of the controller make it the most promising controller for quadrotor attitude stabilization. The outer loop consists of three independent PID controllers: one for altitude control and the other two, together with a dynamics\u2019 inversion, are entitled to the computation of the reference attitude for the inner loop. The capability of the controlled closed-loop system of executing complex trajectories is demonstrated by means of simulations in MATLAB/Simulink\u00ae.",

      "abstract": "The enhanced proliferation of connected entities needs a deployment of innovative technologies for the next generation wireless networks. One of the critical concerns, however, is the spectrum scarcity, due to the unprecedented broadcast penetration rate nowadays. Based on this, visible light communication (VLC) has recently emerged as a viable solution to secure high-speed communications. VLC, a high data rate communication technology, has proven its stature as a promising complementary to its radio frequency (RF) counterpart. VLC is a cost-effective, energy-efficient, and secure technology that exploits the current infrastructure, specifically within indoor and underwater environments. Yet, despite their appealing capabilities, VLC systems face several limitations which constraint their potentials such as LED\u2019s limited bandwidth, dimming, flickering, line-of-sight (LOS) requirement, impact of harsh weather conditions, noise, interference, shadowing, transceiver alignment, signal decoding complexity, and mobility issue. Consequently, non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) has been considered an effective technique to circumvent these shortcomings. The NOMA scheme has emerged as a revolutionary paradigm to address the shortcomings of VLC systems. The potentials of NOMA are to increase the number of users, system\u2019s capacity, massive connectivity, and enhance the spectrum and energy efficiency in future communication scenarios. Motivated by this, the presented study offers an overview of NOMA-based VLC systems. This article provides a broad scope of existing research activities of NOMA-based VLC systems. This article aims to provide firsthand knowledge of the prominence of NOMA and VLC and surveys several NOMA-enabled VLC systems. We briefly highlight the potential and capabilities of NOMA-based VLC systems. In addition, we outline the integration of such systems with several emerging technologies such as intelligent reflecting surfaces (IRS), orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM), multiple-input and multiple-output (MIMO) and unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs). Furthermore, we focus on NOMA-based hybrid RF/VLC networks and discuss the role of machine learning (ML) tools and physical layer security (PLS) in this domain. In addition, this study also highlights diverse and significant technical hindrances prevailing in NOMA-based VLC systems. We highlight future research directions, along with provided insights that are envisioned to be helpful towards the effective practical deployment of such systems. In a nutshell, this review highlights the existing and ongoing research activities for NOMA-based VLC systems, which will provide sufficient guidelines for research communities working in this domain and it will pave the way for successful deployment of these systems.",

      "abstract": "With the exponential growth in the usage of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV), often known as drones, for military, civilian, and recreational purposes. Security of internal communication modules and communication to the ground control station is considered the foremost challenge. Hacking into the system and attacking the internal communication devices with malicious code can disaster the vehicle's system. The need for having a secure communication channel between the internal modules of the vehicle and transmission of data to the ground control station is of utmost crucial. Existing mechanisms based on conventional encryption methods are highly suspectable to attacks as their keys can be broken by employing high computing power. Another challenge with these approaches is undesired high-level data communication latency affecting real-time communication. This study implements a homographic encryption-based technique for secure communication. In addition, we also propose a key regeneration algorithm based on pallier homomorphic encryption. Simulations were conducted using OMNET++ and Aerial Vehicle Network Simulator (AVENS). In this study 54 encryption attacks were collected from different sources. Compared to Digital Encryption Standard (DES) and Advanced Digital Encryption (AES), the proposed approach defended all the communication attacks between the UAV and the ground control station.",

      "abstract": "Vehicular Adhoc Network (VANET) is an established technology that  is well-suited for emerging technologies such as the Internet of  Vehicles (IoV) and Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs). However,  while VANET offers improved methods for addressing contemporary  technology, it also presents significant challenges in providing  adequate security measures for intended access. VANET operates on  multiple execution platforms, such as roadside units, vehicle-tovehicle, vehicle-to-device, and vehicle-to-everything (V2X)  communication. As a result, VANET must establish robust security  measures for future purposes and strengthen protocol authentications  to ensure secure data delivery and network-wide execution. In this  work, we provide an overview of some of the recent security problems  faced by VANET to raise awareness among developers and engineers  about the specific security needs of VANET and how to avoid errors  or intrusions when deploying VANETs in cities and urban areas. We  cover topics such as the classification of security attacks, standard or  security protocol problems and solutions, and the best feasible security  criteria for extended VANETs. Finally, we discuss open issues and  future VANET security developments or concerns. ",

      "abstract": "In smart cities, target detection is one of the major issues in order to avoid traffic congestion. It is also one of the key topics for military, traffic, civilian, sports, and numerous other applications. In daily life, target detection is one of the challenging and serious tasks in traffic congestion due to various factors such as background motion, small recipient size, unclear object characteristics, and drastic occlusion. For target examination, unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) are becoming an engaging solution due to their mobility, low cost, wide field of view, accessibility of trained manipulators, a low threat to people\u2019s lives, and ease to use. Because of these benefits along with good tracking effectiveness and resolution, UAVs have received much attention in transportation technology for tracking and analyzing targets. However, objects in UAV images are usually small, so after a neural estimation, a large quantity of detailed knowledge about the objects may be missed, which results in a deficient performance of actual recognition models. To tackle these issues, many deep learning (DL)-based approaches have been proposed. In this review paper, we study an end-to-end target detection paradigm based on different DL approaches, which includes one-stage and two-stage detectors from UAV images to observe the target in traffic congestion under complex circumstances. Moreover, we also analyze the evaluation work to enhance the accuracy, reduce the computational cost, and optimize the design. Furthermore, we also provided the comparison and differences of various technologies for target detection followed by future research trends.",

This study deals with the design of an optimal route network for autonomous vehicles, considering both vehicle sharing and ride sharing. The problem is modeled as a one-to-many-to-one vehicle routing problem with vehicle capacity and range constraints. An ant colony optimization algorithm is applied to the problem in order to construct a set of routes that satisfies user requests under operational constraints. Results show that the algorithm is able to produce solutions in relatively short computational times, while exploiting the possibility of ride sharing to reduce operating costs. Results also underline the potential of exploiting shared autonomous vehicles in the context of a taxi service for booking trips through electronic reservation systems.",

      "abstract": "Benefiting from the development of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), the types and number of datasets available for image synthesis have greatly increased. Based on such abundant datasets, many types of virtual scenes can be created and visualized using image synthesis technology before they are implemented in the real world, which can then be used in different applications. To achieve a convenient and fast image synthesis model, there are some common issues such as the blurred semantic information in the normalized layer and the local spatial information of the feature map used only in the generation of images. To solve such problems, an improved image synthesis model, SYGAN, is proposed in this paper, which imports a spatial adaptive normalization module (SPADE) and a sparse attention mechanism YLG on the basis of generative adversarial network (GAN). In the proposed model SYGAN, the utilization of the normalization module SPADE can improve the imaging quality by adjusting the normalization layer with spatially adaptively learned transformations, while the sparsified attention mechanism YLG improves the receptive field of the model and has less computational complexity which saves training time. The experimental results show that the Fr\u00e9chet Inception Distance (FID) of SYGAN for natural scenes and street scenes are 22.1, 31.2; the Mean Intersection over Union (MIoU) for them are 56.6, 51.4; and the Pixel Accuracy (PA) for them are 86.1, 81.3, respectively. Compared with other models such as CRN, SIMS, pix2pixHD and GauGAN, the proposed image synthesis model SYGAN has better performance and improves computational efficiency.",

      "abstract": "Vultures are among the most threatened bird guilds on the planet and have a unique functional role within ecosystems. They are therefore subject to increasing research interest, calling for standardised study approaches and monitoring methods. The use of Unmanned Aircraft Systems (UASs) is rapidly gaining popularity in ecological research due to technological advances, affordability, and accessibility. This study reviews the existing peer-reviewed publications and grey literature on the responses of European vultures and other comparable species to UASs, and summarises the types of UAS use, their potential disturbance effects on vultures, and the resulting inter- and intra-specific interactions. Our goal was to assess the potential effects of UASs and to provide practical recommendations to optimise their safe use in vulture conservation and research. We acknowledge the potential of UASs to increase research efficiency and reduce research effort, time, and financial cost. Owing to the absence of sufficient data on long-term disturbance effects, we advocate the precautionary principle and offer a set of species-tailored practical recommendations to limit the potential negative effects of UASs and maximise their value in conservation management. We urge that the physiological and long-term impacts on vulture reproduction are considered and call for standardised monitoring protocols and controls on UAS use. Our conclusions and recommendations are particularly aimed at researchers working on vulture conservation and restoration projects worldwide.",

      "abstract": "This paper is concerned with the output tracking control for a class of network-based nonlinear unmanned marine vehicle (UMV) systems subject to denial-of-service (DoS) attacks, where a Takagi\u2013Sugeno (T\u2013S) fuzzy approach is proposed to grapple with the nonlinearity of UMV. A semi-Markov chain is introduced to reveal the switches of different attack degrees on actuators. The transition probabilities (TPs) and the sojourn-time probability density functions (ST-PDFs) of the introduced semi-Markov chain are partially unavailable because of unpredictable DoS attacks. Through introducing the upper bound of the sojourn time for each attack mode and giving an enlarged known threshold to unavailable TPs and/or ST-PDFs, the sufficient conditions for the $$\\sigma$$ -mean square stability ( $$\\sigma$$ -MSS) with performance of output tracking system are derived in the form of linear matrix inequalities (LMIs). Attack-tolerant controllers are then designed to overcome those stochastic DoS attacks. Finally, the effectiveness of the proposed control scheme is verified by a simulation study.",

      "abstract": "Unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV)-enabled wireless systems are expected for widespread communication applications in future-generation networks because of their flexible deployment and on-demand mobility. This paper considers a UAV-supported system on a generalized environment $$\\alpha -\\kappa -\\mu $$ with arbitrary fading parameters. In an environment, such a system is vulnerable to security threats due to its broadcast nature and the dominant channel of visibility conditions occurring within the system. Thus, the physical layer security of the system is investigated against key secret performance metrics including secure outage probability (SOP), intercept probability, strictly positive secrecy capacity (SPSC), and ergodic secrecy capacity (ESC). In this paper, the derivatives of closed-form expressions of SOP, SPSC and ESC are determined, and the security performance of the system is compared in different fading environments.",

      "abstract": "Internet of Drones (IoD) plays a crucial role in the future Internet of Things due to its important features such as low cost, high flexibility, and mobility. The number of IoD applications is drastically increasing from military to civilian fields. Nevertheless, drones are resource-constrained and highly vulnerable to several security threats and attacks. The use of blockchain technology for securing IoD networks has gained growing attention. To this end, this paper presents a systematic literature review to analyze the current research area regarding the security of IoD environments using the emerging blockchain technology. Forty relevant studies were selected from 129 published articles to answer the identified research questions. The selected studies were classified into three main classes based on blockchain type. Furthermore, a comparison of the reviewed articles in terms of different factors is provided. The research findings show that the blockchain can guarantee fundamental security requirements such as authentication, privacy-preserving, confidentiality, integrity, and access control. Finally, open issues and challenges related to the combination of blockchain and IoD technologies are discussed.",

      "abstract": "Three dimensional (3D) object detection with an optical camera and light detection and ranging (LiDAR) is an essential task in the field of mobile robot and autonomous driving. The current 3D object detection method is based on deep learning and is data-hungry. Recently, semi-supervised 3D object detection (SSOD-3D) has emerged as a technique to alleviate the shortage of labeled samples. However, it is still a challenging problem for SSOD-3D to learn 3D object detection from noisy pseudo labels. In this paper, to dynamically filter the unreliable pseudo labels, we first introduce a self-paced SSOD-3D method SPSL-3D. It exploits self-paced learning to automatically adjust the reliability weight of the pseudo label based on its 3D object detection loss. To evaluate the reliability of the pseudo label in accuracy, we present prior knowledge based SPSL-3D (named as PSPSL-3D) to enhance the SPSL-3D with the semantic and structure information provided by a LiDAR-camera system. Extensive experimental results in the public KITTI dataset demonstrate the efficiency of the proposed SPSL-3D and PSPSL-3D.",

      "abstract": "An autonomous mobile robot system consisting of many mobile computational entities (called robots) attracts much attention of researchers, and it is an emerging issue for a recent couple of decades to clarify the relation between the capabilities of robots and solvability of the problems.\r\nGenerally, each robot can observe all other robots as long as there are no restrictions on visibility range or obstructions, regardless of the number of robots. In this paper, we provide a new perspective on the observation by robots; a robot cannot necessarily observe all other robots regardless of distances to them. We call this new computational model the defected view model. Under this model, in this paper, we consider the gathering problem that requires all the robots to gather at the same non-predetermined point and propose two algorithms to solve the gathering problem in the adversarial (N,N-2)-defected model for N \u2265 5 (where each robot observes at most N-2 robots chosen adversarially) and the distance-based (4,2)-defected model (where each robot observes at most two robots closest to itself), respectively, where N is the number of robots. Moreover, we present an impossibility result showing that there is no (deterministic) gathering algorithm in the adversarial or distance-based (3,1)-defected model, and we also show an impossibility result for the gathering in a relaxed (N, N-2)-defected model.",

      "abstract": "Successful missions in the field often rely upon communication technologies for tactics and coordination. One middleware used in securing these communication channels is Data Distribution Service (DDS) which employs a publish-subscribe model. However, researchers have found several security vulnerabilities in DDS implementations. DDS-Cerberus (DDS-C) is a security layer implemented into DDS to mitigate impersonation attacks using Kerberos authentication and ticketing. Even with the addition of DDS-C, the real-time message sending of DDS also needs to be upheld. This paper extends our previous work to analyze DDS-C\u2019s impact on performance in a use case implementation. The use case covers an artificial intelligence (AI) scenario that connects edge sensors across a commercial network. Specifically, it characterizes how DDS-C performs between unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV), the cloud, and video streams for facial recognition. The experiments send a set number of video frames over the network using DDS to be processed by AI and displayed on a screen. An evaluation of network traffic using DDS-C revealed that it was not statistically significant compared to DDS for the majority of the configuration runs. The results demonstrate that DDS-C provides security benefits without significantly hindering the overall performance.",

      "abstract": "One of the United Nations (UN) Sustainable Development Goals is climate action (SDG-13), and wildfire is among the catastrophic events that both impact climate change and are aggravated by it. In Australia and other countries, large-scale wildfires have dramatically grown in frequency and size in recent years. These fires threaten the world\u2019s forests and urban woods, cause enormous environmental and property damage, and quite often result in fatalities. As a result of their increasing frequency, there is an ongoing debate over how to handle catastrophic wildfires and mitigate their social, economic, and environmental repercussions. Effective prevention, early warning, and response strategies must be well-planned and carefully coordinated to minimise harmful consequences to people and the environment. Rapid advancements in remote sensing technologies such as ground-based, aerial surveillance vehicle-based, and satellite-based systems have been used for efficient wildfire surveillance. This study focuses on the application of space-borne technology for very accurate fire detection under challenging conditions. Due to the significant advances in artificial intelligence (AI) techniques in recent years, numerous studies have previously been conducted to examine how AI might be applied in various situations. As a result of its special physical and operational requirements, spaceflight has emerged as one of the most challenging application fields. This work contains a feasibility study as well as a model and scenario prototype for a satellite AI system. With the intention of swiftly generating alerts and enabling immediate actions, the detection of wildfires has been studied with reference to the Australian events that occurred in December 2019. Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) were developed, trained, and used from the ground up to detect wildfires while also adjusting their complexity to meet onboard implementation requirements for trusted autonomous satellite operations (TASO). The capability of a 1-dimensional convolution neural network (1-DCNN) to classify wildfires is demonstrated in this research and the results are assessed against those reported in the literature. In order to enable autonomous onboard data processing, various hardware accelerators were considered and evaluated for onboard implementation. The trained model was then implemented in the following: Intel Movidius NCS-2 and Nvidia Jetson Nano and Nvidia Jetson TX2. Using the selected onboard hardware, the developed model was then put into practice and analysis was carried out. The results were positive and in favour of using the technology that has been proposed for onboard data processing to enable TASO on future missions. The findings indicate that data processing onboard can be very beneficial in disaster management and climate change mitigation by facilitating the generation of timely alerts for users and by enabling rapid and appropriate responses.",

      "abstract": "The combination between two remote surveying methods is presented herein as a pioneering approach for landslide airborne monitoring. The survey of an active landslide by UAV-based RGB photogrammetry and infrared thermography, sided by the knowledge of the field condition, allowed increasing the scientific experience on the remote sensing of slope instability phenomena by analyzing multiple aspects related to the evolution of key slope features. In this research, the state and distribution of activity of a landslide was monitored by matching data arising from three-dimensional models of the slope, built by exploiting the aerial RGB photogrammetric technology, and thermal outcomes, resulting from the airborne application of infrared thermography principles. In this frame, thermal anomalies detected during different monitoring campaigns allowed recognizing peculiar features along the unstable slope that could be related to specific kinematic elements involved in the landslide activity. Forming cracks, developing scarps, wet terrain portions, and loose material are some of the elements that could be located by integrating thermal outcomes with Digital Surface Models of the slope. Thanks to the different thermal behavior of such elements, strengthened herein by a novel approach of thermal data processing (i.e. the study of thermal slope profiles), the lateral and retrogressive evolution of the studied movement was first hypothesized and then verified in field. Achieved results show that the location of thermal anomalies well corresponds to field structures, which sometimes are hardly detectable by in situ or RGB surveys, thus suggesting the high potential of the methodological approach developed for this study. The scientific validity of presented data gains relevance thanks to the positive field validation. This paves the way to further studies aimed at implementing the infrared aerial survey of landslides, which surely could bring benefits to practical applications in terms of survey speed and spatial coverage, especially in areas characterized by bad field logistics.",

Patients were grouped into two categories; low Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS) (< 3; group 1), and moderate-high EDSS (\u00e2\u0089\u00a5 3; group 2). Patients were evaluated with Beck Depression Inventory (BDI), Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MOCA), Symbol Digit Modalities Test (SDMT), Fatigue Severity Scale (FSS), and calculated Annualized Relapse Rate (ARR) scores. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) was performed with a 1.5T MRI device (Magnetom AERA, Siemens, Erlangen, Germany) twice in a 1-year period. Volumetric analysis was performed by a free, automated, online MRI brain volumetry software. The differences in volumetric values between the two MRI scans were calculated and correlated with the demographic and clinical parameters of the patients.</p>\n <p>\n<b>Results</b>\u00e2\u0080\u0083The number of attacks, disease duration, BDI, and FSS scores were higher in group 2; SDMT was higher in group 1. As expected, volumetric analyses have shown volume loss in total cerebral white matter in follow-up patients (<i>p</i>\u00e2\u0080\u0089<\u00e2\u0080\u00890.001). In addition, putaminal volume loss was related to a higher number of attacks. Besides, a negative relation between FSS with total amygdala volumes, a link between atrophy of globus pallidus and ARR, and BDI scores was found with the aid of network analysis.</p>\n <p>\n<b>Conclusions</b>\u00e2\u0080\u0083Apart from a visual demonstration of volume loss, cranial MRI with volumetric analysis has a great potential for revealing covert links between segmental volume changes and clinical parameters.</p>\n ",

      "abstract": "The underwater gliders are type of autonomous underwater vehicles, which are in their way to be used instead of traditional\u00a0propellers\u00a0or\u00a0thrusters. They are used as submerged gliders or as a part connected to floating hull which is propelled by it. The underwater system depends on different number of hydrofoils\u00a0(underwater wings) that allow it to\u00a0glide\u00a0forward while descending through the water. This paper concentrates on three critical design details: profile of the wings, multiple flapping wings and their angle of attack (AoA), and a method is focused on the mesh generation to predict calm water resistance for the submerged glider system while considering the profile and the maximum rotating angle of the wings and rudder. Flow around submerged wing system model has been calculated at different Froude numbers ranging from 0.1 to 0.6. The grid generator is established for meshing the computational domain with structured hexahedral and unstructured tetrahedral grid. Simulations are carried out using commercial CFD code ANSYS Fluent 19 to calculate calm water resistance of the submerged glider system with different number of hydrofoils. The results conclude that the cambered plate was chosen to design the rudder at 19o AOA and the hydrofoil NACA0012 can be practically applied in the design of the wings at 15o AOA from the resistance point of view. In addition, this investigation introduces a new application for CFD calculations in estimating the resistance of the submerged glider system.",

      "abstract": "Crop disease identification and monitoring is an important research topic in smart agriculture. In particular, it is a prerequisite for disease detection and the mapping of infected areas. Wheat fusarium head blight (FHB) is a serious threat to the quality and yield of wheat, so the rapid monitoring of wheat FHB is important. This study proposed a method based on unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) low-altitude remote sensing and multispectral imaging technology combined with spectral and textural analysis to monitor FHB. First, the multispectral imagery of the wheat population was collected by UAV. Second, 10 vegetation indices (VIs)were extracted from multispectral imagery. In addition, three types of textural indices (TIs), including the normalized difference texture index (NDTI), difference texture index (DTI), and ratio texture index (RTI) were extracted for subsequent analysis and modeling. Finally, VIs, TIs, and VIs and TIs integrated as the input features, combined with k-nearest neighbor (KNN), the particle swarm optimization support vector machine (PSO-SVM), and XGBoost were used to construct wheat FHB monitoring models. The results showed that the XGBoost algorithm with the fusion of VIs and TIs as the input features has the highest performance with the accuracy and F1 score of the test set being 93.63% and 92.93%, respectively. This study provides a new approach and technology for the rapid and nondestructive monitoring of wheat FHB.",

      "abstract": "Habitat structure and quality in the urban agglomeration (UA) are subject to multiple threats and pressures due to ongoing anthropogenic activities and call for comprehensively effective solutions. Many approaches, including cartographic comparison, correlation analysis, the local entropy model, and GeoDetector, were jointly used to clarify the interplay between habitat quality and multiple environmental issues. In response to the overlapped risks of diverse environmental systems, this study presented an integrated research framework to evaluate the spatial influences of multifaceted environmental situations on habitat quality. We conducted the case study in the three largest Chinese UAs: Beijing\u2013Tianjin\u2013Hebei (BTH), Greater Bay Area (GBA), and Yangtze River Delta (YRD). The evaluation results show that the three UAs shared similarities and differences in relationship/impact types and their strengths. In 2015, most of the three UAs\u2019 landscapes delivered low\u2013medium magnitudes of habitat quality (score <0.7) and emerged with unevenly severe consequences over space across different environmental aspects, highlighting the importance of maintaining habitat safety. Overall, habitat quality scores were synergistic with NDVI, but antagonistic to surface heat island intensity (SHII), PM2.5 concentrations, and residential support. However, locally structured relationships exhibited geographical complexity and heterogeneity between habitat quality and environmental systems. Regarding GeoDetector evaluation, PM2.5 concentrations in BTH, SHII in GBA, and NDVI in YRD played a dominant role in single-factor and interaction analysis. More importantly, the synergistic effect of various environmental issues on habitats was manifested as mutually enhanced rather than independent or weakened interactive effects, implying the aggravation of compound effects and the necessity of prioritization schemes. This study could provide beneficial insights into the interconnections between habitats\u2019 sustainability and multifaceted environmental situations in UAs.",

      "abstract": "Lane detection is necessary for developing intelligent Autonomous Vehicles (AVs). Using vision-based lane detection is more cost-effective, requiring less operational power. Images captured by the moving vehicle include varying brightness, blur, and occlusion caused due to diverse locations. We propose a Vision-based Ingenious Lane Departure Warning System (VILDS) for AV to address these challenges. The Generative Adversarial Networks (GAN) of the VILDS choose the most precise features to create images that are identical to the original but have better clarity. The system also uses Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) to learn the average behavior of the samples to forecast lanes based on a live feed of processed images, which predicts incomplete lanes and increases the reliability of the AV\u2019s trajectory. Further, we devise a strategy to improve the Lane Departure Warning System (LDWS) by determining the angle and direction of deviation to predict the AV\u2019s Lane crossover. An extensive evaluation of the proposed VILDS system demonstrated the effective working of the lane detection and departure warning system modules with an accuracy of 98.2% and 96.5%, respectively.",

Therefore, the research interest in drone versus human movement detection and characterization is justified by the fact that such devices represent a potential threat for indoor/office intrusion, while normally, a human presence is allowed after passing several security points. Our paper comparatively characterizes the movement of a drone and a human in an indoor environment. The movement map was obtained using advanced signal processing methods such as wavelet transform and the phase diagram concept, and applied to the signal acquired from UWB sensors.",

      "abstract": "Skin is the largest organ of many animals. Its protective function against hostile environments and predatorial attack makes high mechanical strength a vital characteristic. Here, we measured the mechanical properties of bass fish skins and found that fish skins are highly ductile with a rupture strain of up to 30\u201340% and a rupture strength of 10\u201315 MPa. The fish skins exhibit a strain-stiffening behavior. Stretching can effectively eliminate the stress concentrations near the pre-existing holes and edge notches, suggesting that the skins are highly damage tolerant. Our measurement determined a flaw-insensitivity length that exceeds those of most engineering materials. The strain-stiffening and damage tolerance of fish skins are explained by an agent-based model of a collagen network in which the load-bearing collagen microfibers assembled from nanofibrils undergo straightening and reorientation upon stretching. Our study inspires the development of artificial skins that are thin, flexible, but highly fracture-resistant and widely applicable in soft robots.",

      "abstract": "With the increase in low-power wireless communication solutions, the deployment of Wireless Sensor Networks is becoming usual, especially to implement Cyber-Physical Systems. These latter can be used for Structural Health Monitoring applications in critical environments. To ensure a long-term deployment, battery-free and energy-autonomous wireless sensors are designed and can be powered by ambient energy harvesting or Wireless Power Transfer. Because of the criticality of the applications and the limited resources of the nodes, the security is generally relegated to the background, which leads to vulnerabilities in the entire system. In this paper, a security analysis based on an example: the implementation of a communicating reinforced concrete using a network of battery-free nodes; is presented. First, the employed wireless communication protocols are presented in regard of their native security features, main vulnerabilities, and most usual attacks. Then, the security analysis is carried out for the targeted implementation, especially by defining the main hypothesis of the attack and its consequences. Finally, solutions to secure the data and the network are compared. From a global point-of-view, this security analysis must be initiated from the project definition and must be continued throughout the deployment to allow the use of adapted, updatable and upgradable solutions.",

      "abstract": "Security has been the most widely researched topic, particularly within IoT, and has been considered as the major hurdle in the adoption of different applications of IoT. When it comes to IoV, security is considered as the most inevitable component to ensure a safe and smooth driving experience. CAV is the new era of transportation, integrating intelligence and self-driving capabilities within vehicles and that requires strong security measures to ensure safety. Security alone is not enough. Instead, a complete package including privacy of the vehicles and passengers needs to be added in addition to secure communication. This is because CAVs are under continuous cyber threats and attacks and the most important among them is the DDoS, where a remote attacker can hijack/launch attacks on vehicles remotely. Single point of failure attacks target the centralized trusted body in order to mislead the connected vehicles for personal gains. In this paper, the authors have proposed a secure communication system for CAVs using blockchain, which also ensures the privacy of the vehicle/people. The paper highlights the major components of the proposed system, and its performance is evaluated to check its efficiency against DDoS and Eclipse attacks. The unlinkability and anonymity of the vehicles have been ensured using the zk-SNAKR protocol over Blockchain.",

      "abstract": "Internet of Drones (IoD), designed to coordinate the access of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), is a specific application of the Internet of Things (IoT). Drones are used to control airspace and offer services such as rescue, traffic surveillance, environmental monitoring, delivery and so on. However, IoD continues to suffer from privacy and security issues. Firstly, messages are transmitted over public channels in IoD environments, which compromises data security. Further, sensitive data can also be extracted from stolen mobile devices of remote users. Moreover, drones are susceptible to physical capture and manipulation by adversaries, which are called drone capture attacks. Thus, the development of a secure and lightweight authentication scheme is essential to overcoming these security vulnerabilities, even on resource-constrained drones. In 2021, Akram et al. proposed a secure and lightweight user\u2013drone authentication scheme for drone networks. However, we discovered that Akram et al.\u2019s scheme is susceptible to user and drone impersonation, verification table leakage, and denial of service (DoS) attacks. Furthermore, their scheme cannot provide perfect forward secrecy. To overcome the aforementioned security vulnerabilities, we propose a secure mutual authentication and key agreement scheme between user and drone pairs. The proposed scheme utilizes physical unclonable function (PUF) to give drones uniqueness and resistance against drone stolen attacks. Moreover, the proposed scheme uses a fuzzy extractor to utilize the biometrics of users as secret parameters. We analyze the security of the proposed scheme using informal security analysis, Burrows\u2013Abadi\u2013Needham (BAN) logic, a Real-or-Random (RoR) model, and Automated Verification of Internet Security Protocols and Applications (AVISPA) simulation. We also compared the security features and performance of the proposed scheme and the existing related schemes. Therefore, we demonstrate that the proposed scheme is suitable for IoD environments that can provide users with secure and convenient wireless communications.",

      "abstract": "The cooperative positioning problem of hypersonic vehicles regarding LEO constellations is the focus of this research study on space-based early warning systems. A hypersonic vehicle is highly maneuverable, and its trajectory is uncertain. New challenges are posed for the cooperative positioning capability of the constellation. In recent years, breakthroughs in artificial intelligence technology have provided new avenues for collaborative multi-satellite intelligent autonomous decision-making technology. This paper addresses the problem of multi-satellite cooperative geometric positioning for hypersonic glide vehicles (HGVs) by the LEO-constellation-tracking system. To exploit the inherent advantages of hierarchical reinforcement learning in intelligent decision making while satisfying the constraints of cooperative observations, an autonomous intelligent decision-making algorithm for satellites that incorporates a hierarchical proximal policy optimization with random hill climbing (MAPPO-RHC) is designed. On the one hand, hierarchical decision making is used to reduce the solution space; on the other hand, it is used to maximize the global reward and to uniformly distribute satellite resources. The single-satellite local search method improves the capability of the decision-making algorithm to search the solution space based on the decision-making results of the hierarchical proximal policy-optimization algorithm, combining both random hill climbing and heuristic methods. Finally, the MAPPO-RHC algorithm\u2019s coverage and positioning accuracy performance is simulated and analyzed in two different scenarios and compared with four intelligent satellite decision-making algorithms that have been studied in recent years. From the simulation results, the decision-making results of the MAPPO-RHC algorithm can obtain more balanced resource allocations and higher geometric positioning accuracy. Thus, it is concluded that the MAPPO-RHC algorithm provides a feasible solution for the real-time decision-making problem of the LEO constellation early warning system.",

      "abstract": "CAPTCHA (Completely Automated Public Turing test to tell Computers and Humans Apart), or HIP (Human Interactive Proof), has long been utilized to avoid bots manipulating web services. Over the years, various CAPTCHAs have been presented, primarily to enhance security and usability against new bots and cybercriminals carrying out destructive actions. Nevertheless, automated attacks supported by ML (Machine Learning), CNN (Convolutional Neural Network), and DNN (Deep Neural Network) have successfully broken all common conventional schemes, including text- and image-based CAPTCHAs. CNN/DNN have recently been shown to be extremely vulnerable to adversarial examples, which can consistently deceive neural networks by introducing noise that humans are incapable of detecting. In this study, the authors improve the security for CAPTCHA design by combining text-based, image-based, and cognitive CAPTCHA characteristics and applying adversarial examples and neural style transfer. Comprehend usability and security assessments are performed to evaluate the efficacy of the improvement in CAPTCHA. The results show that the proposed CAPTCHA outperforms standard CAPTCHAs in terms of security while remaining usable. Our work makes two major contributions: first, we show that the combination of deep learning and cognition can significantly improve the security of image-based and text-based CAPTCHAs; and second, we suggest a promising direction for designing CAPTCHAs with the concept of the proposed CAPTCHA.",

      "abstract": "Recent advances in hardware and information technology have accelerated the proliferation of smart and interconnected devices facilitating the rapid development of the Internet of Things (IoT). IoT applications and services are widely adopted in environments such as smart cities, smart industry, autonomous vehicles, and eHealth. As such, IoT devices are ubiquitously connected, transferring sensitive and personal data without requiring human interaction. Consequently, it is crucial to preserve data privacy. This paper presents a comprehensive survey of recent Machine Learning (ML)- and Deep Learning (DL)-based solutions for privacy in IoT. First, we present an in depth analysis of current privacy threats and attacks. Then, for each ML architecture proposed, we present the implementations, details, and the published results. Finally, we identify the most effective solutions for the different threats and attacks.",

      "abstract": "This article is devoted to the problem of information security in complexes with unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV). Science knows a new promising method of information protection: moving target defense (MTD). The essence of this method is that due to periodic changes in the parameters of the infocommunication network the information about the information infrastructure collected by the attacker at the reconnaissance stage becomes irrelevant, and the attack becomes ineffective. This article also discusses the features and types of confidential information processed in complexes with UAV and provides a review of the experience of creating systems for protecting information from unauthorized access of complexes with UAV. The proposed hypothesis is tested using a model created using a tool: the GNS3 program. The model in the form of a test network in the GNS3 emulator recreates the proposed method. It was concluded that the effectiveness of the harmful impact on the complex with UAV was reduced by three times. The disadvantages of the proposed method include the problem of ensuring the availability of protected information resources for other legitimate, authorized participants in network interaction, as well as the need to solve the problem of choosing the optimal frequency of changing parameters.",

      "abstract": "Because of their low expense and ease of rapid deployment, unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) are frequently applied in wireless networks. Although the wireless channel is able to broadcast, legitimate communications between UAVs and ground nodes are incredibly susceptible to severe security threats, such as malicious jamming and eavesdropping. Compared with the traditional line-of-sight channel (LC) model, the probabilistic LC (PrLC) model can better describe the practical channel conditions of UAV-to-ground transmission in city areas. Therefore, this paper considers the UAV-enabled networks under the PrLC model in complex city environments. Specifically, when the UAV transmits classified messages to legitimate ground nodes, multiple active eavesdroppers simultaneously eavesdrop on the transmitted confidential information to interfere with the signal and limit the legal transmission. We jointly optimize the communication connection, the three-dimensional (3D) UAV trajectory, and the transmit power of the UAV to increase the average secrecy rate for the worst condition. Because the problem is non-convex, the best solution is formidable to get, this paper designs an iterative algorithm and use the successive convex approximation (SCA) technique to solve it. Compared to other benchmarks, our proposed algorithm, as demonstrated by numerical results, can effectively balance the elevation angle-distance trade-off to improve secrecy rate performance.",

      "abstract": "In this paper, we describe an algorithm for accurately segmenting multiple nudfclei from clumps of non-overlapping immuno-histochemically stained histological hepatic (liver) images. This problem is notoriously difficult because of the degree of presence of stains among the multi-nucleated cells, the poor contrast of cell cytoplasm, and the presence of mucus, blood, and inflammatory cells in the images. Hepatocellular carcinoma, characterized by cellular and nuclear enlargement, nuclear pleomorphism, and multi-nucleation, poses a prominent threat. Our proposed method addresses the aforementioned issues for an automated diagnosis system by judging the presence of multiple nuclei in a two-step process: the Quickhull algorithm defines the convex hull of each cell in the image and candidate nuclei regions are located with morphological operations. A combination of features containing local minima and shape-dependent features is extracted for the detection of single or multiple nuclei in each cell with a significant reduction in the number of false positives and false negatives providing an accuracy of 89.76%.",

      "abstract": "By using an array of pressure sensors distributed on the surface of an aircraft to measure the pressure of each port, the flush airdata sensing (FADS) system is widely applied in many modern aircraft and unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs). Normally, the pressure transducers of the FADS system should be mounted on the leading edge of the aircraft, where they are sensitive to changes in pressure. For UAVs, however, the leading edge of the nose and wing may not be available for pressure transducers. In addition, the number of transducers is limited to 8\u201310, making it difficult to maintain accuracy in the normal method for FADS systems. An FADS system model for an unmanned flying wing was developed, and the pressure transducers were all located outside the regions of the leading edge areas. The locations of the transducers were selected by using the mean impact value (MIV), and ensemble neural networks were developed to predict the airdata with a very limited number of transducers. Furthermore, an error detection method was also developed based on artificial neural networks and random forests. The FADS system model can accurately detect the malfunctioning port and use the correct pressure combination to predict the Mach number, angle of attack, and angle of sideslip with high accuracy.",

      "abstract": "Voyage Data Recorders (VDRs), often referred to as the \u2018black boxes\u2019 of the shipping industry, collect and store vital data from key sensors and locations around the ship. This data plays a pivotal role in incident investigation, as was seen in the grounding of the Costa Concordia in 2012, and the sinking of the El Faro in 2015. With such an important role to play, the International Maritime Organization (IMO) has mandated that all SOLAS registered ships carry a VDR, which can demonstrate compliance with internationally agreed standards. Without a VDR compliant with these standards a ship cannot sail. However, the rise in the number, and sophistication, of digital devices are making the sector increasingly vulnerable to cyber-attacks. This paper will demonstrate a number of high-risk VDR cyber security vulnerabilities and review the current international technical standards covering all VDR devices being manufactured and used today, drawing attention to the minimum security requirements. The paper will go on to discuss how these standards fail to promote the necessary levels of cyber security needed to protect VDRs from today\u2019s cyber risks, amidst increased demands for digital connectivity for remote and autonomous operations. The paper will conclude by proposing several amendments (technical and non-technical) to the current standards which, if adopted, will help increase the minimum level of security of VDRs. Industry opinions were gathered on this topic, and their beliefs have been included across this paper.",

      "abstract": "The key module for autonomous mobile robots is path planning and obstacle avoidance. Global path planning based on known maps has been effectively achieved. Local path planning in unknown dynamic environments is still very challenging due to the lack of detailed environmental information and unpredictability. This paper proposes an end-to-end local path planner n-step dueling double DQN with reward-based \u03f5-greedy (RND3QN) based on a deep reinforcement learning framework, which acquires environmental data from LiDAR as input and uses a neural network to fit Q-values to output the corresponding discrete actions. The bias is reduced using n-step bootstrapping based on deep Q-network (DQN). The \u03f5-greedy exploration-exploitation strategy is improved with the reward value as a measure of exploration, and an auxiliary reward function is introduced to increase the reward distribution of the sparse reward environment. Simulation experiments are conducted on the gazebo to test the algorithm\u2019s effectiveness. The experimental data demonstrate that the average total reward value of RND3QN is higher than that of algorithms such as dueling double DQN (D3QN), and the success rates are increased by 174%, 65%, and 61% over D3QN on three stages, respectively. We experimented on the turtlebot3 waffle pi robot, and the strategies learned from the simulation can be effectively transferred to the real robot.",

      "abstract": "Odor source localization (OSL) robots are essential for safety and rescue teams to overcome the problem of human exposure to hazardous chemical plumes. However, owing to the complicated geometry of environments, it is almost impossible to construct the dispersion model of the odor plume in practical situations to be used for probabilistic odor source search algorithms. Additionally, as time is crucial in OSL tasks, dynamically modifying the robot\u2019s balance of emphasis between exploration and exploitation is desired. In this study, we addressed both the aforementioned problems by simplifying the environment with an obstacle region into multiple sub-environments with different resolutions. Subsequently, a framework was introduced to switch between the Infotaxis and Dijkstra algorithms to navigate the agent and enable it to reach the source swiftly. One algorithm was used to guide the agent in searching for clues about the source location, whereas the other facilitated the active movement of the agent between sub-environments. The proposed algorithm exhibited improvements in terms of success rate and search time. Furthermore, the implementation of the proposed framework on an autonomous mobile robot verified its effectiveness. Improvements were observed in our experiments with a robot when the success rate increased 3.5 times and the average moving steps of the robot were reduced by nearly 35%.",

      "abstract": "Autonomous unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) have attracted increasing academic and industrial attention during the last decade. Using drones have broad benefits in diverse areas, such as civil and military applications, aerial photography and videography, mapping and surveying, agriculture, and disaster management. However, the recent development and innovation in the field of drone (UAV) technology have led to malicious usage of the technology, including the penetration of secure areas (such as airports) and serving terrorist attacks. Autonomous weapon systems might use drone swarms to perform more complex military tasks. Utilizing a large number of drones, simultaneously increases the risk and the reliability of the mission in terms of redundancy, survivability, scalability, and the quality of autonomous performance in a complex environment. This research suggests a new approach for drone swarm characterization and detection using RF signals analysis and various machine learning methods. While most of the existing drone detection and classification methods are typically related to a single drone classification, using supervised approaches, this research work proposes an unsupervised approach for drone swarm characterization. The proposed method utilizes the different radio frequency (RF) signatures of the drone\u2019s transmitters. Various kinds of frequency transform, such as the continuous, discrete, and wavelet scattering transform, have been applied to extract RF features from the radio frequency fingerprint, which have then been used as input for the unsupervised classifier. To reduce the input data dimension, we suggest using unsupervised approaches such as Principal component analysis (PCA), independent component analysis (ICA), uniform manifold approximation and projection (UMAP), and the t-distributed symmetric neighbor embedding (t-SNE) algorithms. The proposed clustering approach is based on common unsupervised methods, including K-means, mean shift, and X-means algorithms. The proposed approach has been evaluated using self-built and common drone swarm datasets. The results demonstrate a classification accuracy of about 95% under additive Gaussian white noise with different levels of SNR.",

      "abstract": "Forests are increasingly exposed to natural disturbances, including drought, wildfires, pest outbreaks, and windthrow events. Due to prolonged droughts in the last years in Europe, European forest stands significantly lost vitality, and their health condition deteriorated, leading to high mortality rates, especially, but not limited to, Norway spruce. This phenomenon is growing, and new regions are being affected; thus, it is necessary to identify stress in the early stages when actions can be taken to protect the forest and living trees. Current detection methods are based on field walks by forest workers or deploying remote sensing methods for coverage of the larger territory. These methods are based on changes in spectral reflectance that can detect attacks only at an advanced stage after the significant changes in the canopy. An innovative approach appears to be a method based on odor mapping, specifically detecting chemical substances which are present in the forest stands and indicate triggering of constitutive defense of stressed trees. The bark beetle attacking a tree, for example, produces a several times higher amount of defense-related volatile organic compounds. At the same time, the bark beetle has an aggregation pheromone to attract conspecifics to overcome the tree defense by mass attack. These substances can be detected using conventional chemical methods (solid-phase microextraction fibers and cartridges), and it is proven that they are detectable by dogs. The disadvantage of classic chemical analysis methods is the long sampling time in the forest, and at the same time, the results must be analyzed in the laboratory using a gas chromatograph. A potential alternative novel device appears to be an electronic nose, which is designed to detect chemical substances online (for example, dangerous gas leaks or measure concentrations above landfills, volcanic activity, etc.). We tested the possibility of early-stage stress detection in the forest stands using an electronic nose Sniffer4D and compared the individual sensors in it for detecting the presence of attacked and dead trees. Our results indicate the promising applicability of the electronic nose for stress mapping in the forest ecosystem, and more data collection could prove this approach.",

      "abstract": "The use of deep learning (DL) segmentation in cardiac MRI has the potential to streamline the radiology workflow, particularly for the measurement of myocardial strain. Recent efforts in DL motion tracking models have drastically reduced the time needed to measure the heart\u2019s displacement field and the subsequent myocardial strain estimation. However, the selection of initial myocardial reference points is not automated and still requires manual input from domain experts. Segmentation of the myocardium is a key step for initializing reference points. While high-performing myocardial segmentation models exist for cine images, this is not the case for tagged images. In this work, we developed and compared two novel DL models (nnU-net and Segmentation ResNet VAE) for the segmentation of myocardium from tagged CMR images. We implemented two methods to transform cardiac cine images into tagged images, allowing us to leverage large public annotated cine datasets. The cine-to-tagged methods included (i) a novel physics-driven transformation model, and (ii) a generative adversarial network (GAN) style transfer model. We show that pretrained models perform better (+2.8 Dice coefficient percentage points) and converge faster (6\u00d7) than models trained from scratch. The best-performing method relies on a pretraining with an unpaired, unlabeled, and structure-preserving generative model trained to transform cine images into their tagged-appearing equivalents. Our state-of-the-art myocardium segmentation network reached a Dice coefficient of 0.828 and 95th percentile Hausdorff distance of 4.745 mm on a held-out test set. This performance is comparable to existing state-of-the-art segmentation networks for cine images.",

      "abstract": "Data recordings of the movement of vehicles can be enriched with heterogeneous and multimodal data beyond latitude, longitude, and timestamp and enhanced with complementary segmentations, constituting a semantic trajectory. Semantic Web (SW) technologies have been extensively used for the semantic integration of heterogeneous and multimodal movement-related data, and for the effective modeling of semantic trajectories, in several domains. In this paper, we present an integrated solution for the engineering of cultural heritage semantic trajectories generated from unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) and represented as knowledge graphs (KGs). Particularly, this work is motivated by, and evaluated based on, the application domain of UAV missions for documenting regions/points of cultural heritage interest. In this context, this research work extends our previous work on UAV semantic trajectories, contributing (a) an updated methodology for the engineering of semantic trajectories as KGs (STaKG), (b) an implemented toolset for the management of KG-based semantic trajectories, (c) a refined ontology for the representation of knowledge related to UAV semantic trajectories and to cultural heritage documentation, and (d) the application and evaluation of the proposed methodology, the developed toolset, and the ontology within the domain of UAV-based cultural heritage documentation. The evaluation of the integrated UAV solution was achieved by exploiting real datasets collected during three UAV missions to document sites of cultural interest in Lesvos, Greece, i.e., the UNESCO-protected petrified forest of Lesvos Petrified Forest/Geopark, the village of Vrissa, and University Hill.",

      "abstract": "Coastal environments are highly threatened by invasive alien plants (IAP), and Remote Sensing (RS) may offer a sound support for IAP detection and mapping. There is still a need for an overview of the progress and extent of RS applications on invaded coasts that can help the development of better RS procedures to support IAP management. We conducted a systematic literature review of 68 research papers implementing, recommending, or discussing RS tools for IAP mapping in coastal environments, published from 2000 to 2021. According to this review, most research was done in China and USA, with Sporobolus (17.3%) being the better studied genus. The number of studies increased at an accelerated rate from 2015 onwards, coinciding with the transition from RS for IAP detection to RS for invasion modeling. The most used platforms in the 2000s were aircraft, with satellites that increased from 2005 and unmanned aerial vehicles after 2014. Frequentist inference was the most adopted classification approach in the 2000s, as machine learning increased after 2009. RS applications vary with coastal ecosystem types and across countries. RS has a huge potential to further improve IAP monitoring. The extension of RS to all coasts of the world requires advanced applications that bring together current and future Earth observation data.",

      "abstract": "Aquatic invasive plants (AIPs) are a global threat to local biodiversity due to their rapid adaptation to the new environments. Lythrum salicaria, commonly known as purple loosestrife, is a predominant AIP in the upper Midwestern region of the United States and has been designated as a deadly threat to the wetlands of this region. Accurate estimation of its current extent is a top priority, but regular monitoring is limited due to cost-, labor-, and time-intensive field surveys. Therefore, the goal of the present study is to accurately detect purple loosestrife from very high-resolution UAV imagery using deep neural network-based models. As a case study, this study implemented U-Net and LinkNet models with ResNet-152 encoder in the wetlands of the upper Mississippi River situated in La Crosse County, Wisconsin. The results showed that both models produced 88\u201394% training accuracy and performed better in landscapes that were occupied by smaller, disaggregated, and more equitably distributed purple loosestrife. Furthermore, the study adopted a transfer learning approach to implement a trained purple loosestrife model of the first study site and implemented it for the second study site. The results showed that the pre-trained model implementation generated better accuracy in less than half the time of the original model. Therefore, the transfer learning approach, if adapted efficiently, can be highly beneficial for continuous monitoring of purple loosestrife and strategic planning for application of direct biocontrol measures.",

      "abstract": "The use of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVS) has been suggested as a potential communications alternative due to their fast implantation, which makes this resource an ideal solution to provide support in scenarios such as natural disasters or intentional attacks that may cause partial or complete disruption of telecommunications services. However, one limitation of this solution is energy autonomy, which affects mission life. With this in mind, our group has developed a new method based on reinforcement learning that aims to reduce the power consumption of UAV missions in disaster scenarios to circumvent the negative effects of wind variations, thus optimizing the timing of the aerial mesh in locations affected by the disruption of fiber-optic-based telecommunications. The method considers the K-means to stagger the position of the resource stations\u2014from which the UAVS launched\u2014within the topology of Stockholm, Sweden. For the UAVS\u2019 locomotion, the Q-learning approach was used to investigate possible actions that the UAVS could take due to urban obstacles randomly distributed in the scenario and due to wind speed. The latter is related to the way the UAVS are arranged during the mission. The numerical results of the simulations have shown that the solution based on reinforcement learning was able to reduce the power consumption by 15.93% compared to the naive solution, which can lead to an increase in the life of UAV missions.",

      "abstract": "We consider the trusted operation of cyber-physical processes based on an assessment of the system\u2019s state and operating mode and present a method for detecting anomalies in the behavior of a cyber-physical system (CPS) based on the analysis of the data transmitted by its sensory subsystem. Probability theory and mathematical statistics are used to process and normalize the data in order to determine whether or not the system is in the correct operating mode and control process state. To describe the mode-specific control processes of a CPS, the paradigm of using cyber-physical parameters is taken as a basis, as it is the feature that most clearly reflects the system\u2019s interaction with physical processes. In this study, two metrics were taken as a sign of an anomaly: the probability of falling into the sensor values\u2019 confidence interval and parameter change monitoring. These two metrics, as well as the current mode evaluation, produce a final probability function for our trust in the CPS\u2019s currently executing control process, which is, in turn, determined by the operating mode of the system. Based on the results of this trust assessment, it is possible to draw a conclusion about the processing state in which the system is operating. If the score is higher than 0.6, it means the system is in a trusted state. If the score is equal to 0.6, it means the system is in an uncertain state. If the trust score tends towards zero, then the system can be interpreted as unstable or under stress due to a system failure or deliberate attack. Through a case study using cyber-attack data for an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV), it was found that the method works well. When we were evaluating the normal flight mode, there were no false positive anomaly estimates. When we were evaluating the UAV\u2019s state during an attack, a deviation and an untrusted state were detected. This method can be used to implement software solutions aimed at detecting system faults and cyber-attacks, and thus make decisions about the presence of malfunctions in the operation of a CPS, thereby minimizing the amount of knowledge and initial data about the system.",

      "abstract": "In this article, we consider a single unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV)-assisted heterogeneous network in a disaster area, which includes a UAV, ground cellular users, and ground sensor users. The cellular data and sensing data are transmitted to UAVs by cellular users and sensor users, due to the outage of the ground wireless network caused by the disaster. In this scenario, we aim to minimize the energy consumption of all the users, to extend their communication time and facilitate rescue. At the same time, cellular users and sensor users have different rate requirements, hence the quality of service (QoS) of the users should be guaranteed. To solve these challenges, we propose an energy-effective relay selection and resource-allocation algorithm. First, to solve the problem of insufficient coverage of the single UAV network, we propose to perform multi-hop transmission for the users outside the UAV\u2019s coverage by selecting suitable relays in an energy-effective manner. Second, for the cellular users and sensor users inside the coverage of the UAV but with different QoS requirements, we design a non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA)-based transmission scheme to improve spectrum efficiency. Deep reinforcement learning is exploited to dynamically adjust the power level and allocated sub-bands for inside users to reduce energy consumption and improve QoS satisfaction. The simulation results show that the proposed NOMA transmission scheme can achieve 9\u201317% and 15\u201332% performance gain on the reduction of transmit power and the improvement of QoS satisfaction, respectively, compared with state-of-the-art NOMA transmission schemes and orthogonal multiple access scheme.",

      "abstract": "Science-fiction (SF) has become a reference point in the discourse on the ethics and risks surrounding artificial intelligence (AI). Thus, AI in SF\u2014science-fictional AI\u2014is considered part of a larger corpus of \u2018AI narratives\u2019 that are analysed as shaping the fears and hopes of the technology. SF, however, is not a foresight or technology assessment, but tells dramas for a human audience. To make the drama work, AI is often portrayed as human-like or autonomous, regardless of the actual technological limitations. Taking science-fictional AI too literally, and even applying it to science communication, paints a distorted image of the technology's current potential and distracts from the real-world implications and risks of AI. These risks are not about humanoid robots or conscious machines, but about the scoring, nudging, discrimination, exploitation, and surveillance of humans by AI technologies through governments and corporations. AI in SF, on the other hand, is a trope as part of a genre-specific mega-text that is better understood as a dramatic means and metaphor to reflect on the human condition and socio-political issues beyond technology.",

      "abstract": "Unequivocal change in the climate system has put coastal regions around the world at increasing risk from climate-related hazards. Monitoring the coast is often difficult and expensive, resulting in sparse monitoring equipment lacking in sufficient temporal and spatial coverage. Thus, low-cost methods to monitor the coast at finer temporal and spatial resolution are imperative for climate resilience along the world\u2019s coasts. Exploiting such low-cost methods for the development of early warning support could be invaluable to coastal settlements. This paper aims to provide the most up-to-date low-cost techniques developed and used in the last decade for monitoring coastal hazards and their forcing agents via systematic review of the peer-reviewed literature in three scientific databases: Scopus, Web of Science and ScienceDirect. A total of 60 papers retrieved from these databases through the preferred reporting items for systematic reviews and meta-analyses (PRISMA) protocol were analysed in detail to yield different categories of low-cost sensors. These sensors span the entire domain for monitoring coastal hazards, as they focus on monitoring coastal zone characteristics (e.g., topography), forcing agents (e.g., water levels), and the hazards themselves (e.g., coastal flooding). It was found from the meta-analysis of the retrieved papers that terrestrial photogrammetry, followed by aerial photogrammetry, was the most widely used technique for monitoring different coastal hazards, mainly coastal erosion and shoreline change. Different monitoring techniques are available to monitor the same hazard/forcing agent, for instance, unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), time-lapse cameras, and wireless sensor networks (WSNs) for monitoring coastal morphological changes such as beach erosion, creating opportunities to not only select but also combine different techniques to meet specific monitoring objectives. The sensors considered in this paper are useful for monitoring the most pressing challenges in coastal zones due to the changing climate. Such a review could be extended to encompass more sensors and variables in the future due to the systematic approach of this review. This study is the first to systematically review a wide range of low-cost sensors available for the monitoring of coastal zones in the context of changing climate and is expected to benefit coastal researchers and managers to choose suitable low-cost sensors to meet their desired objectives for the regular monitoring of the coast to increase climate resilience.",

      "abstract": "In the mammalian intestine, flagellar motility can provide microbes competitive advantage, but also threatens the spatial segregation established by the host at the epithelial surface. Unlike microbicidal defensins, previous studies indicated that the protective activities of human \u03b1-defensin 6 (HD6), a peptide secreted by Paneth cells of the small intestine, resides in its remarkable ability to bind microbial surface proteins and self-assemble into protective fibers and nets. Given its ability to bind flagellin, we proposed that HD6 might be an effective inhibitor of bacterial motility. Here, we utilized advanced automated live cell fluorescence imaging to assess the effects of HD6 on actively swimming Salmonella enterica in real time. We found that HD6 was able to effectively restrict flagellar motility of individual bacteria. Flagellin-specific antibody, a classic inhibitor of flagellar motility that utilizes a mechanism of agglutination, lost its activity at low bacterial densities, whereas HD6 activity was not diminished. A single amino acid variant of HD6 that was able to bind flagellin, but not self-assemble, lost ability to inhibit flagellar motility. Together, these results suggest a specialized role of HD6 self-assembly into polymers in targeting and restricting flagellar motility.",

      "abstract": "Autonomous underwater vehicles (AUV) recycling in an underwater environment is particularly challenging due to the continuous exploitation of marine resources. AUV recycling via visual technology is the primary method. However, the current visual technology is limited by harsh sea conditions and has problems, such as poor tracking and detection. To solve these problems, we propose a long-term target anti-interference tracking (LTAT) method, which integrates Siamese networks, You Only Look Once (YOLO) networks and online learning ideas. Meanwhile, we propose using the cubature Kalman filter (CKF) for optimization and prediction of the position. We constructed a launch and recovery system (LARS) tracking and capturing the AUV. The system consists of the following parts: First, images are acquired via binocular cameras. Next, the relative position between the AUV and the end of the LARS was estimated based on the pixel positions of the tracking AUV feature points and binocular camera data. Finally, using a discrete proportion integration differentiation (PID) method, the LARS is controlled to capture the moving AUV via a CKF-optimized position. To verify the feasibility of our proposed system, we used the robot operating system (ROS) platform and Gazebo software to simulate the system for experiments and visualization. The experiment demonstrates that in the tracking process when the AUV makes a sinusoidal motion with an amplitude of 0.2 m in the three-dimensional space and the relative distance between the AUV and LARS is no more than 1 m, the estimated position error of the AUV does not exceed 0.03 m. In the capturing process, the final capturing error is about 28 mm. Our results verify that our proposed system has high robustness and accuracy, providing the foundation for future AUV recycling research.",

      "abstract": "A smart city is a city equipped with many sensors communicating with each other for different purposes. Cybersecurity and signal security are important in such cities, especially for airports and harbours. Any signal interference or attack on the navigation of autonomous vehicles and aircraft may lead to catastrophes and risks in people\u2019s lives. Therefore, it is of tremendous importance to develop wireless security networks for the localisation of any radio frequency interferer in smart cities. Time of arrival, angle of arrival, time-difference of arrivals, received signal strength and received signal strength difference (RSSD) are known observables used for the localisation of a signal interferer. Localisation means to estimate the coordinates of an interferer from some established monitoring stations and sensors receiving such measurements from an interferer. The main goal of this study is to optimise the geometric configuration of the monitoring stations using a desired dilution of precision and/or variance-covariance matrix (VCM) for the transmitter\u2019s location based on the RSSD. The required mathematical models are developed and applied to the Arlanda international airport of Sweden. Our numerical tests show that the same configuration is achieved based on dilution of precision and VCM criteria when the resolution of design is lower than 20 m in the presence of the same constraints. The choice of the pathloss exponent in the mathematical models of the RSSDs is not important for such low resolutions. Finally, optimisation based on the VCM is recommended because of its larger redundancy and flexibility in selecting different desired variances and covariances for the coordinates of the transmitter.",

      "abstract": "It has been observed that the use of UAVs in search and rescue (SAR) operations is very advantageous. When, all of a sudden, a crisis strikes, UAV technology is incredibly helpful and works more effectively to identify the entire region of a disaster and identify victims trapped in the region. The deployment of a UAV network with a high battery lifespan and complete coverage of the disaster region is the primary emphasis of this article. For the efficient communication of UAVS, we suggested the intelligent cluster-based multi-unmanned aerial vehicle (ICBM-UAV) protocol. In order to discover victims swiftly and rescue those who are trapped in the afflicted region as soon as possible, ICBM-UAV uses the clustering technique smartly, which helps conserve drone batteries and performs some of the useful computations within the CH and hence helps to lessen workload on network congestion. Dividing the CMBM-UAV into two parts, the information gathering and the user equipment location identification, improves network life and makes the search and rescue operation more efficient and successful. After going to through vigorous result calculation, it is deduced that the proposed scheme has outperformed the existing state-of-the-art protocols such as AODV, OSLR and flocking mechanisms in terms of throughput, PDR, and coverage area probability by considering each scenario with and without the presence of obstacles. Hence, by delivering an exploitable estimate before reaching the victim, the proposed approach could drastically minimize the search and rescue time to save valuable lives.",

      "abstract": "A few promising solutions for thermal imaging Unexploded Ordnance (UXO) detection were proposed after the start of the military conflict in Ukraine in 2014. At the same time, most of the landmine clearance protocols and practices are based on old, 20th-century technologies. More than 60 countries worldwide are still affected by explosive remnants of war, and new areas are contaminated almost every day. To date, no automated solutions exist for surface UXO detection by using thermal imaging. One of the reasons is also that there are no publicly available data. This research bridges both gaps by introducing an automated UXO detection method, and by publishing thermal imaging data. During a project in Bosnia and Herzegovina in 2019, an organisation, Norwegian People\u2019s Aid, collected data about unexploded ordnances and made them available for this research. Thermal images with a size of 720 \u00d7 480 pixels were collected by using an Unmanned Aerial Vehicle at a height of 3 m, thus achieving a very small Ground Sampling Distance (GSD). One of the goals of our research was also to verify if the explosive war remnants\u2019 detection accuracy could be improved further by using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN). We have experimented with various existing modern CNN architectures for object identification, whereat the YOLOv5 model was selected as the most promising for retraining. An eleven-class object detection problem was solved primarily in this study. Our data were annotated semi-manually. Five versions of the YOLOv5 model, fine-tuned with a grid-search, were trained end-to-end on randomly selected 640 training and 80 validation images from our dataset. The trained models were verified on the remaining 88 images from our dataset. Objects from each of the eleven classes were identified with more than 90% probability, whereat the Mean Average Precision (mAP) at a 0.5 threshold was 99.5%, and the mAP at thresholds from 0.5 to 0.95 was 87.0% up to 90.5%, depending on the model\u2019s complexity. Our results are comparable to the state-of-the-art, whereat these object detection methods have been tested on other similar small datasets with thermal images. Our study is one of the few in the field of Automated UXO detection by using thermal images, and the first that solves the problem of identifying more than one class of objects. On the other hand, publicly available thermal images with a relatively small GSD will enable and stimulate the development of new detection algorithms, where our method and results can serve as a baseline. Only really accurate automatic UXO detection solutions will help to solve one of the least explored worldwide life-threatening problems.",

      "abstract": "Monitoring of water retention behavior in soils is an essential process to schedule irrigation. To this end, soil moisture tensiometers usually equipped with mechanical manometers provide an easy and cost-effective monitoring of tension in unsaturated soils. Yet, periodic manual monitoring of many devices is a tedious task hindering the full exploitation of soil moisture tensiometers. This research develops and lab validates a low cost IoT soil moisture tensiometer. The IoT-prototype is capable of measuring tension up to \u221280 Kpa with R2 = 0.99 as compared to the same tensiometer equipped with a mechanical manometer. It uses an ESP32 MCU, BMP180 barometric sensor and an SD card module to upload the measured points to a cloud service platform and establishes an online soil water potential curve. Moreover, it stores the reading on a micro-SD card as txt file. Being relatively cheap (76 USD) the prototype allows for more extensive measurements and, thus, for several potential applications such as soil water matric potential mapping, precision irrigation, and smart irrigation scheduling. In terms of energy, the prototype is totally autonomous, using a 2400 mAh Li-ion battery and a solar panel for charging, knowing that it uses deep sleep feature and sends three data points to the cloud each 6 h.",

      "abstract": "The primordial autophagy process, originally identified as a starvation response in baker\u2019s yeast, has since been shown to have a wide spectrum of functions other than survival. In many cases, it is accepted that autophagy operates as a key tumor suppressor mechanism that protects cells from adverse environmental cues by enforcing homeostasis and maintaining the functional and structural integrity of organelles. Paradoxically, heightened states of autophagy are also seen in some cancers, leading to the prevailing view that the pro-survival aspect of autophagy might be hijacked by some tumors to promote their fitness and pathogenesis. Notably, recent studies have revealed a broad range of cell-autonomous autophagy in reshaping tumor microenvironment and maintaining lineage integrity and immune homeostasis, calling for a renewed understanding of autophagy beyond its classical roles in cell survival. Here, we evaluate the increasing body of literature that argues the \u201cdouble-edged\u201d consequences of autophagy manipulation in cancer therapy, with a particular focus on highly plastic and mutagenic melanoma. We also discuss the caveats that must be considered when evaluating whether autophagy blockade is the effector mechanism of some anti-cancer therapy particularly associated with lysosomotropic agents. If autophagy proteins are to be properly exploited as targets for anticancer drugs, their diverse and complex roles should also be considered.",

      "abstract": "The perception module of autonomous driving needs to maintain high detection accuracy and speed in various weather conditions. Two-dimensional target detection maintains fast detection speed but poor detection accuracy in bad weather, whereas three-dimensional (3D) target detection can still have a good detection effect in bad weather. However, in the current 3D target detection methods, the accuracy of single-stage detection algorithms is insufficient, and the speed of two-stage detection algorithms is slow. Therefore, in this study, we propose a real-time 3D target detection model based on multiple foreground point sampling for autonomous driving, FP-RCNN. FP-RCNN incorporates features from the original points, voxels, and birds-eye view (BEV), uses sparse convolution at the voxel level, performs multiple progressive downsampling to extract features, and maps the obtained features on BEV to obtain BEV features. A three-layer progressive sampling structure was used for key point sampling. The third layer uses instance-aware downsampling to exploit semantic information to ensure that as many foreground points as possible are collected, and the three features are subjected to VSA operations to obtain the final features bound to sampled key points. The second stage divides the proposed box obtained in the first stage, fuses the contextual information of the original points to obtain the final point features, and outputs the confidence box through two fully connected layers. FP-RCNN is tested on the KITTI dataset, and the test results show a 6% improvement in pedestrian detection and a 50% improvement in detection speed compared with a representative two-stage approach.",

      "abstract": "Atrial size and function have been recognized as markers of diastolic function, and diastolic dysfunction has been identified as a predictor of adverse outcomes in repaired tetralogy of Fallot (rTOF). This was a retrospective single-center study with the objective of investigating the use of atrial measurements obtained via CMR for predicting outcomes in rTOF patients. Automated contours of the left and right atria (LA and RA) were performed. A novel parameter, termed the Right Atrioventricular Coupling Index (RACI), was defined as the ratio of RA end-diastolic volume to right ventricle (RV) end-diastolic volume. Patients were risk-stratified using a previously validated Importance Factor Score for the prediction of life-threatening arrhythmias in rTOF. Patients with a high-risk Importance Factor Score (>2) had a significantly larger minimum RA volume (p = 0.04) and RACI (p = 0.03) compared to those with scores \u22642. ROC analysis demonstrated RACI to be the best overall predictor of a high-risk Importance Factor Score (AUC 0.73, p = 0.03). Older age at the time of repair and a diagnosis of pulmonary atresia were associated with a larger RACI. Automated atrial CMR measurements are easily obtained from standard CMRs and have the potential to serve as noninvasive predictors of adverse outcomes in rTOF.",

      "abstract": "Los humedales costeros sustentan a muchas especies de aves marinas amenazadas en todo el mundo y pueden ser fundamentales para su conservaci\u00f3n. El aumento del nivel del mar afecta dr\u00e1sticamente a las marismas costeras, lo que supone la mayor amenaza para la supervivencia de muchas especies de aves marinas, incluidas las gaviotas y los charranes. El charr\u00e1n patinegro Thalasseus sandvicensis es especialmente vulnerable a esta amenaza. Aunque cr\u00eda en una amplia gama de h\u00e1bitats, anida principalmente cerca del agua, justo por encima de la l\u00ednea de costa. Aqu\u00ed describimos la particular vulnerabilidad de toda la poblaci\u00f3n reproductora de charr\u00e1n patinegro de la laguna de Venecia. Se encontraron tres colonias a principios de la temporada de cr\u00eda de 2022, dos de ellas en h\u00e1bitats artificiales: en una peque\u00f1a isla de dragado (0,01 ha; 0,70 m sobre el nivel del mar) en la laguna Norte y en un islote (0,01 ha, elevaci\u00f3n 0,5 m s. n. m.) formado por ladrillos de un antiguo edificio derruido en la laguna Sur. La tercera colonia estaba en una isla pantanosa natural (1,50 ha, 0,40 m s. n. m.). Estas colonias albergaban respectivamente 150, 369 y 1.100 parejas. En total, 1.111 de los 1.619 nidos (68,6%) se inundaron al principio de la temporada, con marcadas diferencias entre emplazamientos; las p\u00e9rdidas de nidos oscilaron entre el 86% en la isla de ladrillos, el 69% en la isla pantanosa y el 0% en la isla de dragado. Los charranes pusieron 1.043 nidadas de reemplazo, exclusivamente en la isla de dragado, uni\u00e9ndose a las aves de este lugar seguro. En total, 795 pollos volaron (0,30 por intento de cr\u00eda) durante toda la temporada reproductora, con diferencias extremas entre los emplazamientos de las colonias. La productividad oscil\u00f3 entre cero pollos volantones por intento de cr\u00eda en la isla de la marisma, pasando por 0,14 en la isla de ladrillos, hasta 0,75 en la isla de dragado.

      "abstract": "Wind turbine generator system plays a fundamental role in electricity generation in industry 4.0, and wind turbines are usually distributed separately and in poor locations. Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAV) which could overcome the above challenges are deployed to collect photographs of wind turbines, which could be used for predictive maintenance of wind turbines and energy management. However, identifying meaningful information from huge amounts of photographs taken by drones is a challenging task due to various scales, different viewpoints, and tedious manual annotation. Besides, deep neural networks (DNN) are dominant in object detection, and training DNN requires large numbers of accurately labeled training data, and manual data annotation is tedious, inefficient, and error-prone. Considering these issues, we generate a synthetic UAV-taken dataset of wind turbines, which provides RGB images, target bounding boxes, and precise pixel annotations as well. But directly transferring the model trained on the synthetic dataset to the real dataset may lead to poor performance due to domain shifts (or domain gaps). The predominant approaches to alleviate the domain discrepancy are adversarial feature learning strategies, which focus on feature alignment for style (e.g. color, texture, illumination, etc.) gaps without considering the content (e.g. densities, backgrounds, and layout scenes) gaps. In this study, we scrutinize the real UAV-taken imagery of wind turbines and develop a synthetic generation method trying to simulate the real ones from the aspects of style and content. Besides, we propose a novel soft-masks guided faster region-based convolutional neural network (SMG Faster R-CNN) for domain adaptation in wind turbine detection, where the soft masks help to extract highly object-related features and suppress domain-specific features. We evaluate the accuracy of SMG Faster R-CNN on the wind turbine dataset and demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach compared with some prevalent object detection models and some adversarial DA models.",

      "abstract": "<p><strong class=\"journal-contentHeaderColor\">Abstract.</strong> Humans spend most of their lives indoors, so indoor air quality (IAQ) plays a key role in human health. Thus, human health is seriously threatened by indoor air pollution, which leads to <span class=\"inline-formula\">3.8\u2005\u00d710<sup>6</sup></span> deaths annually, according to the World Health Organization (WHO). With the ongoing improvement in life quality, IAQ monitoring has become an important concern for researchers. However, in machine learning (ML), measurement uncertainty, which is critical in hazardous gas detection, is usually only estimated using cross-validation and is not directly addressed, and this will be the main focus of this paper. Gas concentration can be determined by using gas sensors in temperature-cycled operation (TCO) and ML on the measured logarithmic resistance of the sensor. This contribution focuses on formaldehyde as one of the most relevant carcinogenic gases indoors and on the sum of volatile organic compounds (VOCs), i.e., acetone, ethanol, formaldehyde, and toluene, measured in the data set as an indicator for IAQ. As gas concentrations are continuous quantities, regression must be used. Thus, a previously published uncertainty-aware automated ML toolbox (UA-AMLT) for classification is extended for regression by introducing an uncertainty-aware partial least squares regression (PLSR) algorithm. The uncertainty propagation of the UA-AMLT is based on the principles described in the <i>Guide to the Expression of Uncertainty in Measurement</i> (GUM) and its supplements. Two different use cases are considered for investigating the influence on ML results in this contribution, namely model training with raw data and with data that are manipulated by adding artificially generated white Gaussian or uniform noise to simulate increased data uncertainty, respectively. One of the benefits of this approach is to obtain a better understanding of where the overall system should be improved. This can be achieved by either improving the trained ML model or using a sensor with higher precision. Finally, an increase in robustness against random noise by training a model with noisy data is demonstrated.</p>",

      "abstract": "The occurrence of humpback whales (Megaptera novaeangliae) across the 2600 km of Hawaiian archipelago, which include the remote atolls, banks, and seamounts of Papah\u0101naumoku\u0101kea Marine National Monument (PMNM), remains poorly understood. Previous surveys for humpback whales beyond the main Hawaiian Islands have been scarce due to limited access and the challenging winter conditions typically found in PMNM when whales are present. To overcome these limitations, a combination of moored acoustic recorders and a Wave Glider autonomous surface vehicle were used to acoustically monitor eight locations and survey approximately 1500 km of the Hawaiian archipelago for the occurrence of humpback whale song during the 2019-2020 breeding season. Relative song prevalence was established using a machine learning tool and by quantifying the level of song chorusing. A generalized additive model framework was applied to understand the associations between habitat variables and humpback whale song occurrence, and sound propagation modeling was performed to examine whether acoustic propagation influenced observed patterns. Whale song was recorded at all monitored and surveyed locations across the archipelago, albeit in varying amounts. Among the locations monitored with moored recorders, the highest and most sustained seasonal chorusing levels were measured off Maui followed by French Frigate Shoals (K\u0101nemiloha\u02bbi), Hawai\u02bbi Island, Middle Bank, O\u02bbahu, Kaua\u02bbi, Gardner Pinnacles (P\u016bh\u0101honu) and Pearl and Hermes Reef (Holoikauaua), respectively. The Wave Glider mission to PMNM revealed that song prevalence was highest at Middle Bank and gradually decreased further to the northwest, reaching a minimum at Gardner Pinnacles (P\u016bh\u0101honu). However, song occurrence increased again at Raita Bank, remaining high between Raita Bank and the Northampton Seamounts. The results reveal that nearly the entire Hawaiian archipelago is exploited by humpback whales during the winter and early spring months. Moreover, song occurrence patterns suggest that there may be more structure in the distribution of whales in PMNM than previously known and raises questions about whether multiple subpopulations occur across the archipelago.",

Hence, several strategies have already been considered to reduce the use of plastic (and non biodegradable) objects, fostering recycling, detect litter in the environment, and catch it. This work aims at implementing a litter detection approach usable also in urban areas, hence considering a mini-UAV (Unmanned Aerial Vehicle) in order to reduce the issues related to flight restrictions. The implemented strategy exploits a high resolution map of the area of interest, a properly trained deep learning litter object detector, and a vision based localization system, which allows to remarkably reduce the positioning error of the UAV navigation system, in order to provide estimates of the litter object positions with an accuracy at decimeter level for objects not too far from locations recognizable in the map.</p>",

      "abstract": "Background Breast cancer is one of the major malignancies threatening women\u2019s health worldwide. The incidence of breast cancer at high altitudes increased over the years. But few studies focused on the characteristics of clinicopathology and molecular subtypes among breast cancer at high altitudes, which are still unknown. Tibet, with an average altitude over 4000 meters, is a representative city at high altitudes, lying in the Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau in southwestern China. This study aimed to identify the clinicopathological characteristics and features of molecular subtypes among Tibetan women with breast cancer, and provide evidence for cancer prevention and personalized therapeutics in high-altitude regions. Methods Between May 2013 and March 2022, 104 Tibetan women from high-altitude regions (Tibetan-group) and 34 Han Chinese women from low-altitude regions (Han-group), consecutively diagnosed with breast cancer in the Hospital of Chengdu Office of People\u2019s Government of Tibetan Autonomous Region, were included in the study. We retrospectively reviewed the clinical character, altitudes of residence, tumor size, lymph nodes metastasis, distant metastasis, pathological type, immunohistochemical index, and molecular subtype. Results In the study, we calculated the patient delay, equal to the period from symptoms onset to hospital visits. The patient delay of Tibetan-group was 7.47\u00b111.53 months, which was significantly longer than that of Han-group, 7.22\u00b122.96 months (p<0.05). Body Mass Index (BMI) was significantly different (p<0.05). Tumors in Tibetan-group were significantly larger than those in Han-group, 4.13\u00b12.98cm and 2.51\u00b10.82cm in diameter, respectively (p<0.05). According to ordinal logistic regression analysis, exposure to high altitudes might result in more advanced T stage (OR=2.45 95%CI 1.10-5.44). 41.3% (43/104) of cases in Tibetan-group had lymph node positive disease, whereas the percentage was found in 38.26% (13/34) in Han-group(p<0.05). The distribution of molecular subtypes was quite significantly different between two groups (p<0.05), according to the comparison of constituent ratios. Conclusion Our study verified that breast cancer at high altitudes possessed its own unique clinicopathological characteristics and distinct features of molecular subtypes. It broadened the understanding of this heterogenous disease and also provided valuable evidence for cancer prevention and personalized therapeutics of breast cancer at high altitudes.",

      "abstract": "The Vulnerable marsh deer Blastocerus dichotomus, the largest native cervid in South America, is declining throughout its range as a result of the conversion of wetlands and overhunting. Estimated densities in open wetlands of several types are 0.1\u20136.8 individuals per km2. We undertook the first unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) survey of the marsh deer to estimate the density of this species in a 113.6 km2 area under forestry management in the lower delta of the Paran\u00e1 River, Argentina. During 6\u20138 August 2019, at a time of year when canopy cover is minimal, we surveyed marsh deer using Phantom 4 Pro UAVs along 94 transects totalling 127.8 km and 8.6 km2 (8.1% of the study area). The 5,506 photographs obtained were manually checked by us and by a group of 39 trained volunteers, following a standardized protocol. We detected a total of 58 marsh deer, giving an estimated density of 6.90 individuals per km2 (95% CI 5.26\u20138.54), which extrapolates to 559\u2013908 individuals in our 113.6 km2 study area. As it has generally been assumed that marsh deer prefer open habitats, this relatively high estimate of density within a forestry plantation matrix is unexpected. We discuss the advantages of using UAVs to survey marsh deer and other related ungulates.",

      "abstract": "We proposed an adaptive H-infinity Cubature Kalman Filter (AH\u221eCKF) to improve the navigation accuracy of a highly manoeuvrable unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV). AH\u221eCKF fuses the Inertial Navigation System (INS) and Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) measurements. Traditional state estimation filters like extended Kalman filters (EKF) and cubature Kalman filters (CKF) assume Gaussian noises. However, their performance degrades for non-Gaussian noises and system uncertainties encountered in real-world applications. Thus, designing filters robust to noise and distribution is crucial. AH\u221eCKF combines H\u221eCKF design with an added adaptive factor to adjust the state estimation covariance matrix according to measurements by exploiting the square root method to yield more numerically stable results (SrAH\u221eCKF). We conducted multiple dynamically rich flight tests to validate our claims using a UAV equipped with a commercially well-known GNSS solution. Results show that the SrAH\u221eCKF state estimation outperforms EKF and CKF methods on average by 90% in various statistical measures.",

      "abstract": "In the era of Unmanned Aerial Systems (UAS), an onboard autopilot occupies a prominent place and is inevitable for many of their modern applications. The efficacy of autopilot heavily relies upon the accuracy of the sensors employed and the capability of the onboard flight controller. In general, aerodynamic behaviour and flight dynamic capabilities of Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) govern the selection and the design of flight controllers. Precise modeling of linear aerodynamic characteristics from flight data can be achieved using many of the existing classical parameter estimation techniques such as Output Error Method (OEM), Equation Error Method (EEM), and Filter Error Method (FEM). However, all the classical methods may not be readily applicable for aerodynamic modeling in nonlinear flight envelopes. The current manuscript is an attempt to exploit the capabilities of the Artificial Intelligence (AI) technique, named Particle Swarm Optimisation (PSO), in combination with Least Squares (LS) cost function to perform linear as well as nonlinear aerodynamic parameter estimation. The aforementioned task is accomplished by considering flight data from manoeuvers pertaining to linear angles of attack, moderate and near stall flight envelopes of two different UAVs with cropped delta planform geometry. Parameters estimated using the proposed LS-PSO method are consistent with minimum standard deviation and are on a par with OEM estimates. The proposed LS-PSO method enhances the capabilities of LS-based EEM while estimating stall characteristic parameters, which was not possible with LS alone. The longitudinal and lateral-directional static parameters estimated from the full-scale wind tunnel testing of the two UAVs were also used to corroborate the results obtained from the flight data using the LS-PSO method.",

      "abstract": "Climate change poses a grave threat to habitats such as forests, endangering the integrity and biodiversity of the global flora and fauna. Accurate surveying techniques are crucial tomodel populations, detect over and under populations, and address them accordingly. This work proposes a process for creating a biodiversitymodel of a forest\u2019s fauna using uncrewed aerial vehicles equipped with RGB and thermal cameras. Real-world data, combined with computer-generated imagery and artificial intelligencemodels, will allow training suitable computer visionmodels. Thesemodels will serve as a reliable and objective data source, enabling the creation of statistical models to describe themonitored forests\u2019 conditions and the biodiversity of its fauna. The proposedmethodology is expected to have significant implications for conservation efforts. It should represent a reliable and efficient way tomonitor and evaluate forest ecosystems, identifying areas of concern and prioritizing conservation efforts. By providing a comprehensive understanding of the biodiversity within a forest, it could help policymakers make informed decisions and develop effective conservation strategies. Ultimately, this work aims to contribute to the preservation of our planet\u2019s biodiversity and the protection of its habitats.",

      "abstract": "The unmanned system is always employed in the uncontrolled radiation source accidents, tackling with geometric field mapping, obstacle avoidance exploration and radiation sources localization simultaneously. To balance the multiple subtasks, a novel source seeking and exploration strategy is proposed in this paper. Firstly, the geometric metric map and radioactive topology map are constructed respectively, while the evaluation functions are established to merge above both maps into the hybrid costmap. Additionally, the RRT* structure is introduced into the path planning module, leading to the capabilities of full-map expansion and multi-source exploitation. By combining the costmap with RRT* structure, the topological paths which satisfy source seeking and map exploration can be generated in the cluttered environment. Experimental results verify the effectiveness of the multi-task path planner, taking into account both multisource exploitation and environment exploration in an online manner.",

      "abstract": "Object detection plays a vital role in numerous fields, including unmanned vehicles, security, and industry, among others. However, recent studies have shown that object detection models based on deep learning are vulnerable to adversarial example attacks. This poses significant challenges to the robustness of the models and substantially limits the applicability of object detection in critical security scenarios. Many existing adversarial attack methods for object detection focus primarily on specific types of object detection models. However, a widespread issue persists regarding weak transferability across different models. Furthermore, there is considerable room for enhancing the success rate of these attacks. To tackle these challenges, this paper proposes a data augmentation framework that leverages on the similarity between adversarial example generation and neural network training. Instead of utilizing the current gradient directly during the iterative process of calculating the gradient, the proposed method employs a weighted average gradient obtained by combining multiple data augmentation methods randomly. Additionally, the method combines the data-augmented gradients with momentum to obtain the gradients applicable to the adversarial attack in order to stabilize the update direction and avoid overfitting to the white-box model. The performance of the proposed method in attacking object detection models is evaluated on the MS COCO dataset using Faster R-CNN, YOLOv3 and YOLOv8. The experimental results demonstrate that, when compared to Projective Gradient Descend method and Iterative Fast Gradient Sign Method, the proposed method outperforms in both white-box and black-box settings. The transfer success rate achieved is up to 81.9% on RetinaNet.",

      "abstract": "The Internet of Vehicles (IoV) is an emerging technological advancement with the potential to significantly transform the automotive industry and transportation networks. Its primary objective is to facilitate communication among vehicles, infrastructure, and a wide range of networked devices. The increasing number of connected vehicles has led to a growing worry among researchers on the security of the Internet of Vehicles (IoV). This topic has become a prominent area of study due to the unresolved difficulties around security and privacy in the IoV. The primary focus lies on security because to the diverse range of security and privacy risks that have the potential to jeopardize the well-being, privacy, and lives of individuals within vehicles. The development of communication protocols for autonomous cars presents novel issues in the exploration and enhancement of IoV networks' performance. These challenges aim to bolster security and privacy measures, while also ensuring the integrity, validity, and secrecy of the sent data. This study presents a comprehensive examination of various symmetric and asymmetric encryption and decryption methods, as well as lightweight cryptographic protocols employed in the context of the Internet of Vehicles (IoV). This paper provides a comprehensive examination and elucidation of security and privacy issues, along with the corresponding remedial measures that have been recently recommended. The content is provided in a manner that is easily comprehensible to the reader. The present study offers a comprehensive analysis of risks, attacks, protocols, and solutions within the realm of collaborative cryptographic algorithms. Through a systematic examination, distinct categories are provided to facilitate a clear understanding of these key components. \u00c2\u00a9 2023 IEEE.",

      "abstract": "The in-vehicle network enables communication between the different vehicle components and systems. It uses specific protocols and bus systems, such as the Controller Area Network (CAN) that provides communication between invehicle parts simultaneously. As the CAN bus plays an essential role in the in-vehicular communication, it is vulnerable to various types of attack, leading to network disconnection and other damage. This paper proposes an intrusion detection system (IDS) based on machine learning that is able to detect and classify CAN messages as DoS, Fuzzy, Spoofing attacks, or normal messages. A comparison between six different algorithms of classification was carried out and found that Decision Tree, Logistic Regression, and Random Forest were the best algorithms, providing excellent results in terms of the evaluation metrics (accuracy, precision, recall, f1-score) as well as the execution time. Thus, the proposed IDS provides a high detection rate to effectively identify most of the attacks and a low computational time to improve the system's efficiency. \u00c2\u00a9 2023 IEEE.",

      "abstract": "As Wireless Sensor Networks (WSN) uses the open channel for communication between the end users and the resource-constrained sensors; maintaining privacy and security is always a challenging task. In this context, Khalid et al. proposed a biometric-based user authentication and Key agreement (AKA) scheme in WSN based on intelligent sensors. However, during this research, it is found that the schemes have many computational flaws and are under the threat of different attacks, such as Impersonation attacks, Stolen Smart Card (SC) attacks, etc. So, to overcome the vulnerabilities found in Khalid et al.\u2019s scheme, an improved robust mutual AKA scheme for WSNs having intelligent sensors is proposed in this article. Moreover, the correctness of the scheme is verified by Burrows\u2013Abadi\u2013Needham (BAN) logic, and the security is proved by Automated Validation of Internet Security Protocols and Applications (AVISPA) simulation tool. Through various security analysis, performance evaluation and comparison with the existing related schemes shows that the proposed scheme could not only highly resistance against various well-known attacks than others but also maintain the low cost at sensor nodes, as well.",

      "abstract": "Deploying socially assistive robots (SARs) at home, such as robotic companion pets, can be useful for tracking behavioral and health-related changes in humans during lifestyle fluctuations over time, like those experienced during CoVID-19. However, a fundamental problem required when deploying autonomous agents such as SARs in people\u2019s everyday living spaces is understanding how users interact with those robots when not observed by researchers. One way to address that is to utilize novel modeling methods based on the robot\u2019s sensor data, combined with newer types of interaction evaluation such as ecological momentary assessment (EMA), to recognize behavior modalities. This paper presents such a study of human-specific behavior classification based on data collected through EMA and sensors attached onboard a SAR, which was deployed in user homes. Classification was conducted using generative replay models, which attempt to use encoding/decoding methods to emulate how human dreaming is thought to create perturbations of the same experience in order to learn more efficiently from less data. Both multi-class and binary classification were explored for comparison, using several types of generative replay (variational autoencoders, generative adversarial networks, semi-supervised GANs). The highest-performing binary model showed approximately 79% accuracy (AUC 0.83), though multi-class classification across all modalities only attained 33% accuracy (AUC 0.62, F1 0.25), despite various attempts to improve it. The paper here highlights the strengths and weaknesses of using generative replay for modeling during human\u2013robot interaction in the real world and also suggests a number of research paths for future improvement.",

However, UAVs can not complete the strike mission alone due to their limited bomb load. Multiple UAVs are often required to complete the strike mission together. In the process of task implementation, the weights of different goals are also very different. In order to maximize the strike effect, it is necessary to find out the optimal task to allocate the task. In order to solve the optimal task allocation problem of heterogeneous UAV attacking the opposite target, genetic algorithm is used to solve the optimal task allocation scheme. By modeling the task allocation model, the fitness function of genetic algorithm is obtained. Finally, the simulation results show that the genetic algorithm can effectively solve the task allocation problem of heterogeneous UAV attacking the opposite target. \u00c2\u00a9 2023 IEEE.",

      "abstract": "The Unmanned Aerial Vehicles' (UAVs) capability to respond to people's needs accounts for their pervasiveness. UAVs with extended functions and capabilities when supplied with communication equipment can be deployed to appropriate places in the field to supplement the networks operate more efficiently and in vital missions such as infrastructure monitoring operations. To be effective, an UAV must interact securely with its network's entities, such as ground control stations, other UAVs, air traffic control systems, and navigation satellite systems. UAVs are exposed to a dangerous and costly world of cyber dangers as a result of cyber technology and connections. The UAV and the Ground Control Station (GCS) exchange information using communication lines, which are vulnerable to cyber attacks. The Micro Air Vehicle Link (MAVLink) protocol is a widely used lightweight communication protocol for enabling communication between UAVs and GCSs. It carries information about the UAV's condition as well as commands for control from the GCS. Although widely used, the MAVLink protocol lacks sufficient security measures and is susceptible to various types of attacks. In the current study, a new stream cipher method with low duty cycles is proposed for protecting data in UAVs and is compared with existing security algorithms on basis of various factors. The research findings' show that by including the suggested method into MAVLink, it is possible to maintain both message secrecy and battery life for a resource-constrained UAV. \u00c2\u00a9 2023 IEEE.",

First, we train the BP neural network with signal data from interference attacks, and then continuously optimize the BP neural network using the sparrow search algorithm (SSA). After iterations, we obtain the final interference detection model. With this detection model, we can detect whether there are malicious interference signals in the drone flight environment and evaluate the detection model using the detection rate. Finally, our detection model has an accuracy of up to 93.64%. \u00c2\u00a9 Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.",

      "abstract": "Attacks on the integrity of Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) onboard software are on the rise. Such attacks are very critical and can lead to man-made incidents. There are several approaches for modeling these attacks. This article explores the interaction between an attacker and a defender. The authors have developed a tree model for attacking firmware integrity. Using this attack-defense tree, a game-theoretic risk assessment scheme is formulated. The effectiveness of the proposed scheme was evaluated on the example of a firmware integrity attack and conclusions were shown confirming the viability of the proposed method. \u00c2\u00a9 2023 IEEE.",

      "abstract": "In n-party Computation, data from different sources are integrated to achieve a common goal, which can be beneficial for different applications. However, this goal may be at risk due to the fact that this corresponding data can be the target of attacks from outside attackers as well as inside ones. On the other hand, in Secure n-party Computation, the data can be processed by preserving security and privacy in such a way that no party can know the data of the others. Several schemes have been proposed to address the issues regarding n-party computation. However, some of them are not efficient in terms of computation and communication, or some of them have used a Trusted Initializer (TI), a third party, which is considered as trusted, for communicating between different parties. Therefore, to address these issues, we propose an n-party secure computation protocol without using any Trusted Initializer (TI). We formally simulate our protocol using Automated Verification of Internet Security Protocols and Applications (AVISPA) as well as we elaborate on the formal and informal security analysis of our proposed protocol. Performance analysis of our proposed protocol is also carried out and it is observed our proposed protocol is secure and protects the privacy of the system. \u00c2\u00a9 2023 IEEE.",

      "abstract": "With the advancement of technology in both combat and defensive situations, the requirement of the use of autonomous vehicles which carry payload is increasing. For the different types of targets, missiles are used. The missile guidance system calculates the miss distance and the trajectory dynamics through automated system. Using image processing, multiple types of target can be identifies. The use of image processing in the guiding system to differentiate between the objects may provide the contemporary error correction in the flight path. In this paper, multiple approaches are used for target identification, tracking and control of trajectory dynamics. The approach identifies two targets, a massive missile truck and an airplane. The algorithm successfully identifies target despite colour variances and almost equivalent structural arrangements. Further trajectory estimation of target is done through constant velocity and constant turn models. When utilising motion estimates and detection, real-world success depends on the ability to recognise visual targets. The Type 1 system\u2019s main objective is flight path management using the yaw, pitch, and roll axes. A common atmospheric model and a set of equations are used by the missile autopilot system to describe the aircraft. In MATLAB Simulink, a simulated missile attack travelling at 328&nbsp;m/s is modelled and simulated. In the model, the missile and its intended target came together at 3.5&nbsp;s.",

      "abstract": "An autonomous vehicle (AV), can drive itself and perform important duties without the help of a driver. To run its software, autonomous cars require sensors, complex algorithms, machine learning systems, and fast processors. Most new car models now include Wi-Fi modules that are used to transmit telemetry data to cloud servers in the background and gather real-time traffic data. In this paper, we will demonstrate how Man-in-the-Middle (MITM) attack can be successfully executed on the Wi-Fi attack surface of an autonomous vehicle. This is accomplished by creating different attack scenarios and performing attack analysis. We analyze mitigation strategies such as enabling VPN (Virtual Private Network), using encryption to protect against MITM attacks. Based on our analysis, enabling VPN is the best mitigation technique against MITM attacks in AVs. \u00c2\u00a9 2023 IEEE.",

      "abstract": "As vehicles increasingly embed digital systems, new security vulnerabilities are also being introduced. Computational constraints make it challenging to add security oversight layers on top of core vehicle systems, especially when the security layers rely on additional deep learning models for anomaly detection. To improve security-aware decision-making for autonomous vehicles (AV), this paper proposes a bi-level security framework. The first security level consists of a one-shot resource allocation game that enables a single vehicle to fend off an attacker by optimizing the configuration of its intrusion prevention system based on risk estimation. The second level relies on a reinforcement learning (RL) environment where an agent is responsible for forming and managing a platoon of vehicles on the fly while also dealing with a potential attacker. We solve the first problem using a minimax algorithm to identify optimal strategies for each player. Then, we train RL agents and analyze their performance in forming security-aware platoons. The trained agents demonstrate superior performance compared to our baseline strategies that do not consider security risk. \u00c2\u00a9 2023 IEEE.",

      "abstract": "To achieve sustainable development goals, it is crucial to ensure the best practices through the whole mining cycle of Critical Raw Materials (CRM) used in high-tech, low-carbon goods (batteries, wind turbines, electronics). This is the aim of the Secure and Sustainable Supply of Raw Materials for EU Industry (S34I) Horizon Europe (HE) project that began on January 1st, 2023. S34I is investigating new data-driven methods to analyze Earth Observation (EO) data, supporting systematic mineral exploration (and other) activities to increase European autonomy regarding CRM resources. The S34I project is based on satellite data, airborne, Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV), ground-based conventional in-situ techniques/methods, and fieldwork. This study presents the first preliminary results based on Sentinel-1 and Sentinel-2 data using classical image processing techniques (RGB combinations, band ratio, Principal Component  Analysis \u2013 PCA, and unsupervised classification) for mineral exploration in Spain, either: (i) on land (Aramo area), to gain  knowledge on cobalt (Co) deposits (and associate CRMs) by hydrothermal alteration mapping; and (ii) offshore/shallow waters (Ria de Vigo area), to update the knowledge on coastal metallic placers including CRMs such as Ti, Sn, Li, Rare Earth Elements (REEs) and Au. Among the techniques, PCA proved most effective, followed by band ratios, and self-proposed algorithms for detecting placer minerals showed promise, warranting further investigation. In the future, S34I will exploit Copernicus Contributing Missions (CCM) and other EU hyperspectral satellite sensors such as PRISMA and EnMAP. Different Artificial Intelligence (AI) techniques will, in the future, promote advances and innovative methods that mining stakeholders can use to address the challenges faced in different phases of the mining life cycle.

      "abstract": "Herein, a twin-boom, inverted V-tailed unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) featuring a foldable bi-wing configuration is proposed for logistics and transportation applications. We employed the Navier&#x2013;Stokes solver to numerically simulate steady, incompressible flow conditions. By examining the effects of key design parameters on aerodynamic characteristics and bypass flow fields in a two-dimensional state, we were able to suggest a more optimized foldable wing design. Building on the two-dimensional analysis, we performed aerodynamic assessments of the three-dimensional aircraft geometry. Our results indicated that appropriate wing and gap parameters can significantly enhance lift characteristics, maintaining high lift even during large-angle flights. Specifically, when compared to a mono-wing, the lift coefficient of the bi-wing increased by 27.1&#x0025; at a 14&#x00B0; angle of attack, demonstrating the effectiveness of our wing-and-gap design. Optimal aerodynamic performance was achieved when the gap distance equalled the chord length in both flow and vertical directions. Further, the right combination of airfoil configuration, wing axes angle, and wingspan can improve flow field aerodynamic characteristics, while also enhancing the wing&#x2019;s stall capacity. The lift coefficient reached its maximum value at an angle of attack of 15&#x00B0;, which has the potential to reduce takeoff and landing distances, thereby enhancing the UAV&#x2019;s overall safety.",

According to the advancement of technology, automatic methods and algorithms are developed to assist engineers in results interpretation.Automated procedures and the use of robots allow the inspection of larges structures (pipelines, reactor vessels...) consequently, the amount of data to analyze become more and more large and thus too long time consuming.. That is why automating results analyzes and Artificial Intelligence (AI) are mean fields of research in this domain.This article describes an AI based method to ultrasonic image classification. The objective is to recognize images relatives to defective scanned zones and images corresponding to safe zones. In the first step, image characteristics to apply as inputs to a classifier have to be determined and extracted. Exploiting the Support Vector Machine (SVM) classification models, we classified these images first by implementing the low-level features and then the high-level features. \u00c2\u00a9 2023 IEEE.",

      "abstract": "Autonomous vehicles heavily rely on various sensors to evaluate their surroundings and issue essential control commands. Nonetheless, these sensors are susceptible to false data injection and spoofing attacks, posing a significant security threat. In response, this paper proposes a channel-spatial-temporal attention-based autoencoder network to detect sensor spoofing attacks on autonomous vehicles. The innovative network utilizes the reconstruction error based on the autoencoder to detect abnormalities in input time series data collected from multiple sensors. The proposed model consists of a memory-augmented based spatial-attention block and PSE-Res2Net block-based encoder and decoder. PSE-Res2Net block initially adopts Res2Net module to generate a multi-scale feature graph and enhance multi-dimensional representation ability of neural network, then applies the PSENet module to capture location-aware channel information and channel-sensitive spatial information through the interaction of channel attention and spatial attention. Moreover, the memory-augmented based temporal-attention block is developed to integrate multi-scale features and aggregate global sequence information of sensor measurements. Experimental evaluations conducted on the comma2k19, KITTI, and CCSAD datasets illustrate the superiority of the proposed detection model over baseline technologies. It exhibits enhanced performance in terms of mPre, mRe, mF1 score, and showcases heightened resilience against noise and attacks.",

      "abstract": "Representing relevant information from volume data sets is a problem often faced in visualization. Generating meaningful images from highly-complex volume data sets is a challenging, tedious task requiring specialized knowledge of the distribution and properties of the data. Traditionally, this task has been carried out manually via specialized user interfaces. We propose a volume visualization pipeline which facilitates the automatic generation of high-quality images from volume data sets. Our method involves a direct volume renderer which generates images from volume data based on visual mappings provided by a transfer function. Central to our approach is a quality-focused descriptor which exploits the properties of the distribution of gradient orientations of an alpha-bounded surface within the volume. This feature is useful for determining transfer functions that result in the rendering of corresponding images depicting various details from the volume. We show that by using this feature as an optimization objective, the generation of high quality images can be automated. Using simple genetic algorithms, we can automatically generate sets of images illustrating coherent, easily-distinguishable and high-quality surfaces of relevant structures from volume data. \u00c2\u00a9 2023 IEEE.",

      "abstract": "Antibiotic resistance is one of the greatest public health threats today, mainly due to the non-rational use of antibiotics. Acinetobacter baumannii is an example of a microorganism with high antibiotic resistance that has developed rapidly in recent years. Consequently, only a few lastresort antibiotics, such as colistin, are currently effective against it. In this work, we propose a random agent-based computational model to describe the evolution of colistin-resistant A. baumannii in the population of Valencia (Spain) and to predict its impact both on the whole population and by age groups. The agent- based model uses a synthetic population of individuals with a vector of characteristics or state variables. These variables change over time based on a series of random events with certain conditional probabilities. The synthetic population statistical features and the probabilities have been found in demographic and hospital databases. One of these probabilities, the probability of infection by a resistant strain, has been modeled using random differential equations. The model takes into account antibiotic consumption as the primary driving force of variation and assumes non-rewersibility of resistance as the worst-case scenario. The agent-based model calibration and the selection of a real-world representative set of solutions have been carried out using the Partide Swarm Optimization evolutionary algorithm. This approach takes into account the inherent stochasticity of the model and the uncertainty of the data. Finally, projections of the incidence and absolute cases of colistin-resistant A. baumannii have been performed. Our results suggest that, if the same consumption pattern continues, the ervolution of the colistin-resistant strain proportion will be exponential, exceeding 50% in 2025. Additionally, the results reveal that, despite the low incidence in Valencian hospitals, the impact on people over 60 years old will be more significant in terms of the number of cases. Based on these findings, it can be deduced that colistin will cense to be an effective antibiotic in the coming years, negatively impacting the human population, especially the most advanced age groups. \u00c2\u00a9 The authors.

      "abstract": "The ability to accurately predict others\u00e2\u0080\u0099 behavior is central to the safety and efficiency of robotic systems in interactive settings, such as human\u00e2\u0080\u0093robot interaction and multi-robot teaming tasks. Unfortunately, robots often lack access to key information on which these predictions may hinge, such as other agents\u00e2\u0080\u0099 goals, attention, and willingness to cooperate. Dual control theory addresses this challenge by treating unknown parameters of a predictive model as stochastic hidden states and inferring their values at runtime using information gathered during system operation. While able to optimally and automatically trade off exploration and exploitation, dual control is computationally intractable for general interactive motion planning, mainly due to the fundamental coupling between the robot\u00e2\u0080\u0099s trajectory plan and its prediction of other agents\u00e2\u0080\u0099 intent. In this paper, we present a novel algorithmic approach to enable active uncertainty reduction for interactive motion planning based on the implicit dual control paradigm. Our approach relies on sampling-based approximation of stochastic dynamic programming, leading to a model predictive control problem that can be readily solved by real-time gradient-based optimization methods. The resulting policy is shown to preserve the dual control effect for a broad class of predictive models with both continuous and categorical uncertainty. To ensure the safe operation of the interacting agents, we use a runtime safety filter (also referred to as a \u00e2\u0080\u009cshielding\u00e2\u0080\u009d scheme), which overrides the robot\u00e2\u0080\u0099s dual control policy with a safety fallback strategy when a safety-critical event is imminent. We then augment the dual control framework with an improved variant of the recently proposed shielding-aware robust planning scheme, which proactively balances the nominal planning performance with the risk of high-cost emergency maneuvers triggered by low-probability agent behaviors. We demonstrate the efficacy of our approach with both simulated driving studies and hardware experiments using 1/10 scale autonomous vehicles. \u00c2\u00a9 The Author(s) 2023.",

      "abstract": "Mars exploration is a hotspot in human planetary exploration. Rotary unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) offer advantages such as vertical takeoff/landing and flexibility, enhancing Mars exploration efficiency. However, the low temperature and low density Martian atmosphere lead to the rotor flow field being in a low Reynolds and high Mach number state, causing laminar separation and impacting aerodynamics. To improve Martian rotorcraft aerodynamics, the NACA0012-34 rotor airfoil\u2019s aerodynamic characteristics and surface suction control technology were studied numerically under Martian conditions. By obtaining the NACA0012-34 airfoil\u2019s basic flow characteristics in the Martian atmosphere, the suction control technology was proposed, the effects and mechanisms of surface suction on inhibiting laminar separation and enhancing airfoil lift were studied, the influence of suction position, velocity ratio, and hole width on flow control effectiveness was explored. Findings demonstrate effective suppression of laminar separation and enhanced airfoil lift through suction control under the Martian atmosphere. The relative position of the suction hole and the separation starting point is a critical factor in determining the effectiveness of suction control. Moreover, selecting an appropriate suction velocity ratio and suction hole width can further contribute to increasing the lift of the airfoil.",

      "abstract": "Predicting the future trajectories of surrounding vehicles based on their history trajectories is a critical task in autonomous driving. However, when small crafted perturbations are introduced to those history trajectories, the resulting anomalous (or adversarial) trajectories can significantly mislead the future trajectory prediction module of the ego vehicle, which may result in unsafe planning and even fatal accidents. Therefore, it is of great importance to detect such anomalous trajectories of the surrounding vehicles for system safety, but few works have addressed this issue. In this work, we propose two novel methods for learning effective and efficient representations for online anomaly detection of vehicle trajectories. Different from general time-series anomaly detection, anomalous vehicle trajectory detection deals with much richer contexts on the road and fewer observable patterns on the anomalous trajectories themselves. To address these challenges, our methods exploit contrastive learning techniques and trajectory semantics to capture the patterns underlying the driving scenarios for effective anomaly detection under supervised and unsupervised settings, respectively. We conduct extensive experiments to demonstrate that our supervised method based on contrastive learning and unsupervised method based on reconstruction with semantic latent space can significantly improve the performance of anomalous trajectory detection in their corresponding settings over various baseline methods. We also demonstrate our methods' generalization ability to detect unseen patterns of anomalies. \u00c2\u00a9 2023 IEEE.",

We consider the multiplicative attacks in the RSU-OBU communication messages. The training and validation data sets are generated by using an automated driving toolbox in MATLAB. Attack detector performance is evaluated using the validation data set that is not included in the training data sets.

      "abstract": "There is a significant surge in unmanned aerial vehicles\u2019 (UAVs) popularity with an ongoing increase in demand due to their multi-functional uses. The capacity of the UAVs to respond to society and industry needs account for their pervasiveness. UAVs can be strategically deployed to enhance network efficiency and support critical missions, including vital tasks like infrastructure monitoring operations. To be effective, a UAV must interact securely with its network\u2019s entities, such as ground control stations, other UAVs, air traffic control systems, and navigation satellite systems. UAVs are exposed to a dangerous and costly world of cyber dangers as a result of cyber technology and connections. The UAV and the Ground Control Station (GCS) exchange information using communication lines, which are vulnerable to cyber-attacks. As a result, detective, defensive, and preventative countermeasures are critical. The Micro Air Vehicle Link (MAVLink) protocol is a widely used lightweight communication protocol for enabling communication between UAVs and GCSs. It outlines communication exchanges between a GCS and a UAV. It carries information about the UAV\u2019s condition as well as commands for control from the GCS. Although widely used, the MAVLink protocol lacks sufficient security measures and is susceptible to various types of attacks, which can pose significant risks to public safety. UAV data should be encrypted because they are very sensitive. To give a high level of security, complex operation encryption techniques are developed. These mathematical operations bring forth issues with efficiency and power usage, though. One of these methods, the ChaCha cipher, recently gained popularity after Google used it in several applications. In the current study, a new stream cipher method with low-duty cycles is proposed for protecting data in UAVs and is compared with existing security algorithms on the basis of various factors. The research findings show that by including the suggested method in MAVLink, it is possible to maintain both message secrecy and battery life for a resource-constrained UAV. This can be done while using comparable amounts of memory and CPU and without affecting MAVLink\u2019s performance.",

      "abstract": "Replacing military aircraft with Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAV) offers advantages such as reducing costs and risks associated with conventional military aircraft. To defend against enemy UAV attacks, anti-drone systems are used. While most technologies focus on drone detection, this paper proposes a process of tracking targets using arbitrary UAV to enhance camera data quality or directly engage and neutralize targets. The system comprises drone detection, movement prediction, and chasing. Devices such as radar are used to detect drones, and they provide Time-Space-Position Information (TSPI) using suitable data formats. Using Machine Learning (ML) techniques make it feasible to predict an object's future location, represented with equations. Utilizing trained machine learning models, the Auto-pilot Application Programming Interface (API) of the drone is employed to track based on the predicted results. Through experiments, the feasibility of predicting an object's future location using various ML techniques has been confirmed. Furthermore, verification has been conducted to establish the attainability of implementing the Auto-pilot API through the utilization of DJI's API. \u00c2\u00a9 2023 ICROS.",

      "abstract": "The structural analysis of cultural heritage buildings, including their monitoring and maintenance, requires accurate 3D models of the structure, especially when these monuments are threatened (e.g., anthropogenic and natural disturbances).  However, monuments such as castles and monasteries often lack such construction plans. Structure from motion (SfM) photogrammetry and Terrestrial Laser Scanning (TLS) techniques can provide a geometrically accurate and cost-efficient survey solution to derive such plans. The accuracy and spatial resolution of the derived 3D reconstructions depend on instrumentation and data processing procedures. Here, remote sensing data, acquired from Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAV) and TLS surveys, were combined to map and monitor an eighteenth-century monastery. The monastery, located close to the village of Skoutera in Western Greece, is within the area of an active landslide that has already impacted different building elements. Significant cracks have appeared on the ground floor and the walls of the building putting its structural integrity in question. A DJI Phantom four Pro UAV together with photogrammetry were used for the aerial surveys. Ground observations with a Leica P50 TLS were used to map the interior and the exterior of the monastery. The derived 3D point clouds from the TLS scans obtained at different time periods were processed with change detection methods for the precise mapping of the ongoing displacements in building\u2019s elements and quantitative mapping of the cracks.  Moreover, a Building Information Modeling (BIM) approach was used to generate a structural plan of the monastery that could facilitate the monitoring process and possible maintenance interventions in the future.

      "abstract": "Multispectral image pairs can provide independent and complementary information to more comprehensively describe detection targets, thereby improving the robustness and reliability of object detectors. The performance of an object detector depends on how cross-modality features are extracted and fused. To exploit the different modalities fully, we propose a lightweight yet effective cross-modality feature fusion approach named gated weighted normative feature fusion. In the feature extraction stage, our proposed dual-input backbone network can extract richer and more useful features. In the feature fusion stage, the fusion module can eliminate redundant features, dynamically weigh the importance of two image features, and further normalize fused features. Experiments and ablation studies on several publicly available datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our method. Our proposed method achieved better performance in terms of mAP50 with 80.3%, mAP with 41.8%, and mAP50 with 98.0%, mAP with 68.0% on the FLIR and LLVIP datasets, respectively. In particular, the inference speed of our method is twice as fast as the current state-of-the-art method.",

      "abstract": "An autonomous vehicle (AV), also known as driver-less car, is able to operate itself and execute critical activities without the need for human interaction. Sensors, complicated algorithms, machine learning systems and powerful processors are used to run software in autonomous vehicle. The majority of modern car models in the market has integrated Wi-Fi modules which are used to send telemetry data to back-end cloud servers and obtain real-time traffic data. In this paper, we will demonstrate how deauthentication attacks can be successfully executed on Wi-Fi attack surface of an autonomous vehicle. This is accomplished by creating different attack scenarios and performing attack analysis. We analyze mitigation strategies such as enabling Management Frame Protection (MFP) in Wi-Fi Protected Access 2 (WPA2) and using Wi-Fi Protected Access 3 (WPA3) to protect against deauthentication attacks. Based on our analysis, using WPA3 is the best mitigation technique against deauthentication attacks in AVs. \u00c2\u00a9 2023 IEEE.",

      "abstract": "This paper addresses the problem of simultaneous cyber attack estimation and sensor attack detection for connected automated vehicles (CAVs), where the vehicle-to-vehicle communication network suffers from false data injection attacks and vehicular radar sensors experience spoofing attacks. First, a delicate proportional-integral observer (PIO) is developed to estimate the unavailable longitudinal vehicle tracking errors and the injected attack signal in real-time. Second, leveraging a residual signal generated from the PIO, an effective detection mechanism, which involves residual evaluation and thresholding, is designed to identify the radar spoofing attacks. Furthermore, due to the concurrent effects of false data injection attacks and spoofing attacks on the estimation errors, formal stability and performance analysis in terms of robustness against false data injection and sensitivity against spoofing is then performed. Finally, simulation examples are provided to demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed attack estimation and attack detection method. \u00c2\u00a9 2023 IEEE.",

      "abstract": "This paper addresses the cooperative trajectory prediction problem of multiple UAVs in air combat. By using the historical trajectory information of each UAV and its neighbors, a novel GAN-CI algorithm is designed based on generate adversarial networks. The algorithm is used to generate multiple prediction trajectories through a generative adversarial network, and the input information is analyzed and processed by a cooperative information interaction module. It is shown that the algorithm improves the average prediction accuracy by 45% over the generative adversarial network without cooperative interaction information and 38% over the Long Short-Term Memory algorithm with pooling module. \u00c2\u00a9 2023 IEEE.",

      "abstract": "There are numerous species of flowers worldwide, and these species hold outstanding economic, cultural, and ecological significance in human life. Flower species recognition benefits applications like searching for flowers in digital libraries and floriculture. Recently, with the high advancement in computer vision and deep learning technologies, automated flower species recognition systems have attracted many scientific researchers. Exploiting deep learning to recognize flower species from images accurately represents an existing problem that should be resolved. Therefore, this paper uses various deep convolutional neural network (CNN) approaches like (VGG-19, ResNet-152V2, MobileNet-V2, InceptionResNet-V2, DenseNet-201, and Xception) are carried out to recognize various flower species. The flower images dataset acquired from Kaggle includes five categories and is utilized in the experiments. Among other implemented approaches, DenseNet201 attained the highest results with an accuracy of 94.12%. \u00c2\u00a9 2023 IEEE.",

      "abstract": "Research has recently grown on multi-agent systems (MAS) and their coordination and secure cooperative control, for example in the field of edge-cloud computing. MAS offers robustness and flexibility compared to centralized systems by distributing control across decentralized agents, allowing the system to adapt and scale without overhaul. The collective behavior emerging from agent interactions can solve complex tasks beyond individual capabilities. However, controlling high-order nonlinear MAS with unknown dynamics raises challenges. This paper proposes an enhanced genetic algorithm strategy to enhance secure cooperative control performance. An efficient encoding method, adaptive decoding schemes, and heuristic initialization are introduced. These innovations enable compelling exploration of the solution space and accelerate convergence. Individual enhancement via load balancing, communication avoidance, and iterative refinement intensifies local search. Simulations demonstrate superior performance over conventional algorithms for complex control problems with uncertainty. The proposed method promises robust, efficient, and consistent solutions by adapting to find optimal points and exploiting promising areas in the space. This has implications for securely controlling real-world MAS across domains like robotics, power systems, and autonomous vehicles.",

      "abstract": "In the realm of financial security, the detection and prevention of credit card fraud has become paramount. With the ever-increasing reliance on digital transactions, the risk of fraudulent activities targeting credit card systems has grown significantly. To combat this, sophisticated techniques are required to swiftly identify and mitigate potential threats. Machine learning, a corner-stone of modern data analysis, has emerged as a powerful tool in this pursuit. By leveraging vast datasets and employing advanced algorithms, machine learning enables the automated scrutiny of transactions, distinguishing between legitimate and fraudulent activities with remarkable preci-sion. This paper introduces an intelligent method for credit card fraud detection that relies on Competitive Swarm Optimization (CSO) and Random Weight Network (RWN). Additionally, the system includes an automated hybrid feature selection capability to identify the most pertinent features during the detection process.

      "abstract": "In today\u00e2\u0080\u0099s era, the lifestyle of people has become much more sophisticated due to the involvement of stress, anxiety, and depression in the daily routine of human beings. In such a scenario, cardiac diseases are growing rapidly in youngsters and senior citizens. It is also observed that cardiac diseases are crucial and sensitive, including life-threatening chances. So, it is essential to detect and prevent such cardiac disorders within the required time for recovery. Since there has been a lot of research in the prediction and prevention of cardiac disorders, cardiac arrhythmia is also one of the majorly occurring diseases in the bulk of the population. The electrocardiogram is the cheap and best way to diagnose the problem of cardiac arrhythmia, and a huge amount of data is collected daily in hospitals and pathological centers. Previously, various automated models were developed for detecting cardiac arrhythmia using deep learning approaches and machine learning. In this work, we have reviewed recently developed automated models and evaluated their performance based on specific parameters like deployed datasets, variation of input data, applied application, methodology, and results obtained by the developed model. The limitations of reviewed papers are also mentioned in addition to their future scope for improvement. \u00c2\u00a9 2024 Tehran University of Medical Sciences.",

      "abstract": "In recent years, the application of multi-UAV cooperation systems has expanded across various domains. Enhancing the coordination performance of multi-UAV systems can be achieved through task allocation methods, typically relying on a hierarchical structure. This paper proposes a novel approach using a modified genetic algorithm (GA) to address the integrated task allocation and path planning problems for multi-UAV attacking multi-target. To create a more realistic mission scenario, multiple constraints, such as resource requirement and simultaneous target arrival, are considered. The modified GA incorporates tailored crossover and mutation operators that ensure compliance with the aforementioned constraints. Furthermore, an unlocking strategy is devised to prevent the occurrence of a chromosome deadlock condition, in which several UAVs become stuck in an infinite waiting state. Through simulation results, the modified GA is demonstrated to effectively delivers feasible solutions to the coupled task allocation and path planning problems, preserving the integrated nature of the optimization process. Monte Carlo simulations are conducted to highlight the superiority of the proposed method in comparison to conventional approaches. \u00c2\u00a9 2024 Elsevier Ltd",

      "abstract": "Seismic signals classification has many real-time applications related to monitoring and collecting information for investigations, public safety, and prevention of security breaches. We cross-amalgamated the seismic signals with acoustic data augmentation/feature extraction techniques, keeping the beneficial effects of each domain. In this context, we have identified the human walk from that of an animal by manipulating the seismic response. This work presents a robust automated system for surveillance against noisy environments for the classification of seismic events, which is trained to exploit the collected geo signals, namely the physical security dataset (PSD). In this context, an ensemble machine learning-based integrated physical security paradigm (EML-PSP) framework is proposed for automatically classifying humans and animals on seismic signals through a cross-domain ultra-fused feature extraction (UFFE) module using numerous speech-related feature extraction approaches. For the model to learn considerably, we have introduced a hybrid augmentation module (HAM) to synthesize realistic seismic signals based on multiple acoustic augmentation schemes. The ensemble features with enhanced discrimination power have been used to train ensemble algorithms like light-gradient boosted machine (LGBM), random forest-, and adaptive boosting-models. The exhaustive comparison of the proposed solution has been carried out with other state-of-the-art methods. On exploiting the UFFE-based features, the performance of the LGBM ensemble outnumbered other classifiers with an F1-Score of 0.9961 \u00c2\u00b1 0.0031. The Matthews correlation coefficient and accuracy were 0.9841 \u00c2\u00b1 0.0127 and 99.4111 \u00c2\u00b1 0.0047 percent, respectively. The geo sensor's PSD results illustrated that the EML-PSP framework has adequate physical security and surveillance prospects. \u00c2\u00a9 2023 Elsevier Ltd",

      "abstract": "In this paper, we propose a 3D object detection method called MMAF-Net that is based on the multi-view and multi-stage adaptive fusion of RGB images and LiDAR point cloud data. This is an end-to-end architecture, which combines the characteristics of RGB images, the front view of point clouds based on reflection intensity, and the bird's eye view of point clouds. It also adopts a multi-stage fusion approach of \u00e2\u0080\u009cdata-level fusion + feature-level fusion\u00e2\u0080\u009d to fully exploit the strength of multimodal information. Our proposed method addresses key challenges found in current 3D object detection methods for autonomous driving, including insufficient feature extraction from multimodal data, rudimentary fusion techniques, and sensitivity to distance and occlusion. To ensure the comprehensive integration of multimodal information, we present a series of targeted fusion methods. Firstly, we propose a novel input form that encodes dense point cloud reflectivity information into the image to enhance its representational power. Secondly, we design the Region Attention Adaptive Fusion module utilizing an attention mechanism to guide the network in adaptively adjusting the importance of different features. Finally, we extend the 2D DIOU (Distance Intersection over Union) loss function to 3D and develop a joint regression loss based on 3D_DIOU and SmoothL1 to optimize the similarity between detected and ground truth boxes. The experimental results on the KITTI dataset demonstrate that MMAF-Net effectively addresses the challenges posed by highly obscured or crowded scenes while maintaining real-time performance and improving the detection accuracy of smaller and more difficult objects that are occluded at far distances. \u00c2\u00a9 2023 The Author(s)",

      "abstract": "The powertrain efficiency of most small unmanned air vehicles (SUAVs) depend on the aerodynamic performance of multiple propellers, which must be modelled before its optimisation. To predict propeller performance while capturing interaction effects not accountable for by momentum theories, the Virtual Blade Model (VBM) can be used at much lower costs than conventional Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD). However, the accuracy of VBM depends on aerofoil polar data that often misrepresent rotational and three-dimensional effects that influence small propellers. In an attempt to expand the capabilities of VBM, it is a common practice to introduce correction models for aerofoil coefficients in its formulation, but the actual effectiveness of such approach for small propeller analysis remains unassessed. In this paper, VBM in OpenFOAM was extended with stall delay and tip loss models, while aerodynamic databases at low Reynolds numbers were built with XFOIL and extrapolated to the full angle of attack range. The accuracy of three VBM versions was validated against wind tunnel measurements of two off-the-shelf small propellers. For the lower-pitch propeller, thrust and power at low advance ratios and efficiency at high advance ratios were significantly improved by the stall delay model. But for the higher-pitch propeller, thrust and power were overpredicted with extended versions of VBM under most operating conditions, which is attributable to an excessive shift of effective angles of attack to the post-stall region by the stall delay model and to uncertainties in extrapolated polar data. The results suggest that without reliable procedures for obtaining polar data, correction models should be implemented in VBM only for the simulation of low-pitch propellers operating at low advance ratios, given their avoidance of the effective angle of attack range where XFOIL and extrapolation methods are mainly expected to fail in predicting lift behaviour. \u00c2\u00a9 2024 Elsevier Masson SAS",

      "abstract": "The most popular technique for specification requirements is natural language. The disadvantage of natural language is ambiguity. Boilerplates are syntactic patterns which limit the ambiguity problem associated with using natural language to specify system/software requirements. Also, using boilerplates is considered a useful tool for inexperienced engineers to define requirements. Using linguistic boilerplates, constrains the natural language syntactically. Furthermore, a domain-specific ontology is used to constrain requirements semantically, as well. In requirements specification, using ontologies helps to restrict the vocabulary to entities, properties, and property relationships which are semantically related. The above results in avoiding or making fewer mistakes. This work makes use of the combination of boilerplate and ontology. Usually, the attributes of boilerplates are completed with the help of the ontology. The contribution of this paper is that the whole boilerplates is stored in the ontology and attributes and fixed elements are part of the ontology. This combination helps to correct semantically and syntactically requirement construction. This paper proposes a tool based on a domain-specific ontology and a set of predefined generic linguistic boilerplates for requirements engineering. We create a domain-specific ontology and a minimal set of boilerplates for an ATM (Automated Teller Machine). We carried out an experiment in order to obtain evidence for the effectiveness and efficiency of our method. The experiment took the form of a case study for the ATM domain and our proposed method was evaluated by users. The contribution and novelty of our methodology is that we created a tool for defining requirements that integrates boilerplate templates and an ontology. We exploit the boilerplate language syntax, mapping them to Resource Description Framework triples which have also a linguistic nature.",

      "abstract": "Point cloud 3D models are gaining increasing popularity due to the proliferation of scanning systems in various fields, including autonomous vehicles and robotics. When employed for rendering purposes, point clouds are typically depicted with their original colors acquired during the acquisition, often without taking into account the lighting conditions of the scene in which the model is situated. This can result in a lack of realism in numerous contexts, especially when dealing with animated point clouds used in eXtended reality applications, where it is desirable for the model to respond to incoming light and seamlessly blend with the surrounding environment. This paper proposes the application of physically based rendering (PBR), a rendering technique widely used in real-time computer graphics applications, to animated point cloud models for reproducing specular reflections, and achieving a photo-realistic and physically accurate look under any lighting condition. To achieve this, we first explore the extension of commonly used animated point cloud formats to incorporate normal vectors and PBR parameters, like roughness and metalness. Additionally, the encoding of the animated environment maps necessary for the PBR technique is investigated. Then, an animated point cloud model is rendered with a shader implementing the proposed PBR method. Finally, we compare the outcomes of this PBR pipeline with traditional renderings of the same point cloud produced using commonly used shaders, taking into account different lighting conditions and environments. Through these comparisons, we demonstrate how the proposed PBR method enhances the visual integration of the point cloud with its surroundings. Furthermore, it will be shown that using this rendering technique, it is possible to render different materials, by exploiting the features of PBR and the encoding of the surrounding environment. \u00c2\u00a9 2023 by ASME.",

      "abstract": "In weed control the aims of securing crop productivity and protecting biodiversity are often difficult to reconcile. Currently, the development of autonomous in-field intervention technology, such as field robots, is creating new potential for minimizing trade-offs between these two aims. To exploit this potential, weed management strategies need to adapt. However, it is currently unclear which kind of input information (e.g. weed cover, number of weeds, weed species identity) is required for such a targeted approach, and which impacts the robotic application has on the trade-off between crop yield and biodiversity. Here, we used a dataset from organically farmed fields to assess several weed management strategies, simulating robot-supported weed control. Specifically, we used within-field heterogeneity of several weed and crop productivity variables to model effects of different kinds of input information for a hypothetical, spatially selective robotic weed control system. The results showed that, at a defined yield loss, gamma diversity (number of weed species on the entire investigated area) is maintainable to a large degree, even without information on weed or crop heterogeneity within the field being used to decide where to weed. However, to maintain alpha diversity (average number of weed species per plot), more spatially explicit input information is required, such as on the number of species per plot, weed quantity (weed cover per species), and weed competitiveness. Consequently, a weeding robot would have to be technically capable of distinguishing between individual weed species, measuring weed cover, processing captured information in real time and removing weeds at per-plant level. Further, it could be shown that the success of such a complex weed management strategy is independent of the degree of spatial heterogeneity of crop yield and of the present level of weed species richness. \u00c2\u00a9 2024 The Authors",

      "abstract": "Nowadays, various edge applications play an increasingly important role in our life, in which video data accounts for a dominant portion of the data traffic. Although standard compression methods, such as H.264 and MPEG4, can considerably reduce the wireless bandwidth for transmission energy savings of edge devices, the large volume of raw video streaming data is still buffered in edge device video buffer, constituting non-negligible energy consumption. Beyond energy issues, edge video data has been increasingly applied in safety\u00e2\u0080\u0093critical scenarios, where reliability has also become a critical concern. Unlike the controlled accuracy sacrifice of the lossy compression mechanism, the high information content per bit may render compressed data more sensitive to random transient faults attacking (i.e., soft errors), thereby inducing severe safety hazards in some video processing tasks (e.g., autonomous vehicle collision). Thus, in this paper, we propose a \u00e2\u0080\u009csoft error efficient\u00e2\u0080\u009d on-the-fly compression mechanism named DUAL-C to achieve energy savings in edge device video buffer while maintaining data reliability. Firstly, observing the duplicate feature of upper bits and approximable characteristic of lower bits within the camera sensors generated streaming raw pixel blocks, we design two compressing techniques: DU-C extracts the common duplicate upper-bits while AL-C merely stores one representative approximate lower-bits for all pixels within a block. By combining DU-C and AL-C with the Sampling-based Approximation paradigm (SA), DUAL-C achieves the overall energy consumption reduction of the video buffer by 71.31%. Secondly, to avoid the reliability \u00e2\u0080\u009cdark side\u00e2\u0080\u009d introduced by compression, we conduct a comprehensive error resilience analysis of compressed data and merely harden the error-critical control bits and common upper bits with ECC. Evaluation results show that DUAL-C compressed data exhibits even better error robustness than its uncompressed counterpart with negligible protection overhead. \u00c2\u00a9 2023 Elsevier B.V.",

      "abstract": "In this paper, an adversarial deep reinforcement learning-based control method is proposed to address the issue of robust depth tracking of an underactuated autonomous underwater vehicle in the presence of intrinsic coupled dynamics and external disturbances. First, long-short-term-memory neural network is presented to memorize and predict the changes in the state of vehicle, and a cascaded multilayer perception projects the output into action space of vehicle. Subsequently, adversarial deep reinforcement learning scheme is applied to the training of control agent by introducing an adversary which counteracts the control behavior, whereby the agent is enabled to learn the control strategy in different distributions of state transition. For evaluation of the performance, a control agent is pre-trained in simulation environment based on the reliable digital model of a real vehicle, and the simulation environment is paced at one iteration per second to align with real-time operations to ensure the portability of training result. Furthermore, the training cost is also extremely reduced. Finally, experiments are conducted with time-varying disturbances to further prove the feasibility of the proposed learning-based control scheme on a prototype of underwater vehicle in towing tank. Moreover, comparative experiment results show the better robustness performance of the learning-based control agent than that of classic line-of-sight based proportional\u00e2\u0080\u0093integral\u00e2\u0080\u0093derivative and adaptive line-of-sight based proportional\u00e2\u0080\u0093integral\u00e2\u0080\u0093derivative controllers in different scenarios. \u00c2\u00a9 2023 Elsevier Ltd",

      "abstract": "Given the pervasive use of deep learning models across various domains, ensuring model security has emerged as a critical concern. This paper examines backdoor attacks, a form of security threat that compromises model output by poisoning the training data. Our investigation specifically addresses backdoor attacks on object detection models, vital for security-sensitive applications like autonomous driving and smart city systems. Consequently, such attacks on object detection models could pose significant risks to human life and property. Consequently, backdoor attacks on object detection could pose serious threats to human life and property. To elucidate this security risk, we propose and experimentally evaluate five backdoor attack methods for object detection models. The key findings are: (1) Unnecessary Object Generation: a globally embedded trigger creating false objects in the target class; (2) Partial Misclassification: a trigger causing specific class misclassification; (3) Global Misclassification: a trigger reclassifying all objects into the target class; (4) Specific Object Vanishing: a trigger causing non-detection of certain objects; (5) Object Position Shifting: a trigger causing bounding box shifts for a specific class. To assess attack effectiveness, we introduced the Attack Success Rate (ASR), which can surpass 1 in object detection tasks, thus providing a more accurate reflection of the attack impact. Experimental outcomes indicate that the ASR values of these varied backdoor attacks frequently approach or surpass 1, demonstrating our method's capacity to impact multiple objects simultaneously. Additionally, to augment trigger stealth, we introduce Backdoor Attack with Wavelet Embedding (BAWE), which discreetly embeds triggers as image watermarks in training data. This embedding method yields more natural triggers with enhanced stealth. Highly stealthy triggers are less detectable, significantly increasing the likelihood of attack success and efficacy. We have developed a Transformer-based network architecture, diverging from traditional neural network frameworks. Our experiments across various object detection datasets highlight the susceptibility of these models and the high success rate of our approaches. This vulnerability poses significant risks to digital twin systems utilizing object detection technology. Our methodology not only enhances trigger stealth but also suits dense predictive tasks and circumvents current neural network backdoor attack detection methods. The experimental findings expose key challenges in the security of object detection models, particularly when integrated with digital twins, offering new avenues for backdoor attack research and foundational insights for devising defense strategies against these attacks. \u00c2\u00a9 2024 Elsevier Ltd",

      "abstract": "As a typical Internet of Things system, unmanned swarms can execute missions efficiently, while reduce risks and ensure personnel safety during operations. Because swarms in different physical domains have different advantages, the cross-domain swarms received lots of attentions recently. Since swarm has the ability to resist damage and recover from damage through self-organization and self-reconfiguration, resilience has become an important indicator for swarm design and mission planning in adversarial environments. Existing resilience evaluation methods require a complete degradation-recovery-stabilization process of system performance, which is not proper for the cross-domain swarm under dynamic and uncertain environment. This paper proposes a dynamic resilience evaluation method for cross-domain swarms in confrontation scenario. First, a cross-domain swarm confrontation model is developed and the swarm confrontation performance indicator is proposed. Second, a dynamic resilience evaluation method is proposed for cross-domain swarm. Then, a confrontation strategy selection model is given based on the resilience measurement. A case study of air-ground swarm in confrontations is provided for illustration and analysis. As can be seen from the simulation results, the proposed dynamic resilience method can better capture the dynamic and uncertain nature of cross-domain swarms in confrontation. The proposed strategy selection model can improve the overall resilience of the swarm, and ultimately improve the winning percentage of the cross-domain swarm in confrontation. \u00c2\u00a9 2023",

The underwater polarization navigation is a newly-developed solution for self-orientation. However, the polarization navigation depending on the Rayleigh scattering model is susceptible to the multiple scattering induced by water depth. To address this issue, the underwater light intensity field is exploited benefiting from its environment suitability. By means of calculating the gradient of light intensity, a vector-field model, with resemblance to the ideal Rayleigh model in geometry, can be established for solar-tracking. The integrated navigation model is built based on the solar vector estimated by light intensity gradient (LIG) and inertial navigation system for heading determination. The static test in water tank and dynamic sea trial were conducted to validate the effectiveness of the LIG-based solar-tracking and orientation method, respectively. \u00c2\u00a9 2023 Elsevier Ltd",

However, many unexpected cyber-attacks may disturb or disrupt the normal communication of the agents, thus reducing the interacting efficiency of multiagent systems. Ever since the cyber-attacks have been proposed, the resilient control problem for multiagent systems has been intensively explored in light of the communication network growth. However, most of the consequences only focused on denial-of-service (DoS) attacks or deception attacks independently. Distinguished from the existing resilient control mechanisms, the current investigation represents the first attempt at designing an adaptive resilient controller for multiagent systems according to the sampled-based adaptive event-triggered manner, where denial-of-service (DoS) attacks and deception attacks are both considered. First, the hybrid cyber-attacks model and its impact on the closed-loop system are addressed. And then, an adaptive event-triggered strategy is proposed to reduce network resource consumption and ease the communication burden, where the designed adaptive law can automatically adjust the triggering threshold. Finally, the consensus state of multiagent systems is capable of achieving via a series of reasonable control rules formulated through Lyapunov functional approach despite suffering hybrid cyber-attacks. And a simulation example is given to substantiate the feasibility of the proposed method. \u00c2\u00a9 2024 Elsevier Ltd",

      "abstract": "This paper introduces a novel Deep Learning (DL) architecture for inferring temperature information from aerial true-color RGB images by transforming them into Infrared Radiation (IR) domain. This work is motivated by a few facts. First, off-the-shelf contemporary drones are typically equipped only with regular cameras. Second, IR heat-mapping cameras are costly and heavy for payload-limited drones. Third, additional communication channels and power supply would be needed when including IR cameras. Finally, IR cameras provide lower resolution and shorter distance ranges than RGB cameras. Therefore, learning-based translation of aerial IR recordings to RGB images can be extremely useful not only for new tests but also for offline processing of the currently available forest fire datasets with RGB images. We offer an Improved Conditional-Generative Adversarial Network (IC-GAN), where matched IR images are used as a condition to guide the translation process by the generator. The U-Net-based generator is concatenated with a mapper module to transform the output into a stack of diverse color spaces with learnable parameters. To avoid the unnecessary penalization of pixel-level disparities and achieve structural similarity, we include clustering alignment to the loss function. The proposed framework is compared against several state-of-the-art methods, including U-Net, Efficient U-Net, GAN, and Conditional-GAN from both subjective (human perception) and objective evaluation perspectives. The results support our method's efficacy, demonstrating a significant improvement of around 6% in PSNR, 15% in UQI, 9% in SSIM, and 23% in IoU metrics. \u00c2\u00a9 2023 Elsevier Ltd",

      "abstract": "This paper proposes a novel trajectory tracking control strategy for autonomous surface vehicles (ASVs), subject to actuator constraints and under denial-of-service (DoS) attacks. Firstly, a fixed-time disturbance observer (FTDO) is used to estimate and compensate unknown external disturbances, which enhances the robustness of the motion system. Secondly, a novel fixed-time filter is designed by combining dynamic surface technology with fixed-time control, which avoids the problem of differential explosion, and reduces the filtering error. Lastly, in order to address the effects of actuator constraints and DoS attacks, an auxiliary system (AS) and a compensation system (CS) are included in the fixed-time dynamic surface controller based on FTDO. The proposed method improves the robustness, stability and accuracy of the closed-loop system. Additionally, the reference tracking error converges to the neighborhood of the origin within a fixed-time. The superiority of the proposed control method over traditional control strategies from the existing literature is demonstrated in simulations. \u00c2\u00a9 2023 Elsevier Inc.",

      "abstract": "Moving target search is a challenging dynamic path planning problem. In this scenario, unmanned aerial vehicles endeavor to locate a moving entity based on sensor information, utilizing the optimal path generated by a search algorithm. Based on the Bayesian principle, the task can be transformed into an optimization issue of the fitness function with the maximum probability of capturing the objective. In this study, an improved version of the sand cat swarm optimization algorithm, called the ISCSO search algorithm, is designed to tackle the moving target search issue effectively. Firstly, the presented ISCSO algorithm enhances the planning efficiency of the algorithm by encoding the unmanned aerial vehicle search path information into a set of motion paths through the motion-encoded mechanism. Secondly, the elite pooling strategy and the adaptive T-distribution are constructed to effectively improve the algorithm's ability to escape local optima and enhance its variability. Finally, ISCSO proposes a main architecture that seamlessly merges the search and attack methods of the sand cat swarm optimization algorithm, striking a balance between global and local search capabilities. To evaluate the superiority of the proposed algorithm, nine diverse search scenarios are constructed to verify its performance. The simulation results demonstrate that ISCSO achieves higher detection accuracy and offers more effective search paths for locating dynamic targets in comparison to other well-established metaheuristic algorithms.

Therefore, there is an urgent need to develop an effective method for AFB1 detection. In this work, we developed an automatic reaction equipment and nanozyme-enhanced immunosorbent assay (Auto-NEISA) for sensitive and accurate detection of AFB1 by combining the highly effective signal probes with a self-designed automated immunoreactive equipment. Wherein, polystyrene (PS) nanoparticles were used as signal carriers for loading a massive in situ-synthesized platinum and palladium bimetallic nanozyme, which could enrich horseradish peroxidase-labeled goat anti-mouse antibody (HRP-Ab2) on the nanozyme surface to form a bimetallic nanozyme\u00e2\u0080\u0093bioenzyme hybrid material for multiple signal amplification. The entire reaction could be automatically completed by the self-developed immunoreactive equipment. The Auto-NEISA method realized the sensitive detection of AFB1 with a wide linear detection range of 10\u00e2\u0080\u0093104 pg/mL, at a low limit of detection (LOD) of 5.52 pg/mL. The LOD was 65-fold lower than that of the enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Additionally, Auto-NEISA was successfully applied to detect AFB1 in real food samples, demonstrating that it has considerable potential for detecting food contaminants with high accuracy and efficiency. \u00c2\u00a9 2024 Elsevier B.V.",

It is based on the fact that the image gradient (directional change in intensity or color) at every pixel in the image contains the information about the anisotropy at that particular pixel i.e., the local alignment is maintained in the orthogonal direction to the gradient. Structure tensor metrics are formulated demonstrating to be able to summarize the distribution of gradient directions within the neighborhood of any pixel within a two-dimensional domain (surface). An image analysis is presented that evaluates the alignment in desired regions of interest (ROIs) in SEM images of VA-CNTs. This method has been exploited to study the alignment of two different kinds of VA-CNTs: one grown via the thermal chemical vapor deposition (T-CVD) method and the second synthesized via the plasma enhanced chemical vapor deposition (PE-CVD) method. \u00c2\u00a9 2024 The Author(s)",

      "abstract": "Exploiting stronger winds at offshore farms leads to a cyclical need for maintenance due to the harsh maritime conditions. While autonomous vehicles are the prone solution for O&M procedures, sub-sea phenomena induce severe data degradation that hinders the vessel's 3D perception. This article demonstrates a hybrid underwater imaging system that is capable of retrieving tri-dimensional information: dense and textured Photogrammetric Stereo (PS) point clouds and multiple accurate sets of points through Light Stripe Ranging (LSR), that are combined into a single dense and accurate representation. Two novel fusion algorithms are introduced in this manuscript. A Joint Masked Regression (JMR) methodology propagates sparse LSR information towards the PS point cloud, exploiting homogeneous regions around each beam projection. Regression curves then correlate depth readings from both inputs to correct the stereo-based information. On the other hand, the learning-based solution (RHEA) follows an early-fusion approach where features are conjointly learned from a coupled representation of both 3D inputs. A synthetic-to-real training scheme is employed to bypass domain-adaptation stages, enabling direct deployment in underwater contexts. Evaluation is conducted through extensive trials in simulation, controlled underwater environments, and within a real application at the ATLANTIS Coastal Testbed. Both methods estimate improved output point clouds, with RHEA achieving an average RMSE of 0.0097 m - a 52.45% improvement when compared to the PS input. Performance with real underwater information proves that RHEA is robust in dealing with degraded input information; JMR is more affected by missing information, excelling when the LSR data provides a complete representation of the scenario, and struggling otherwise. \u00c2\u00a9 2023 Elsevier B.V.",

      "abstract": "Internet of Medical Things (IoMT) refers to a group of dedicated devices, i.e., wearable sensors attached to the human body for capturing the real-time data, specifically physiological signals, to develop an automated and technology-assisted smart healthcare framework. However, due to the miniaturized nature and their limited capabilities, data captured by these wearable devices need to be consistent, especially in terms of accuracy and precision. Therefore, data must be refined prior to the actual processing, which is a challenging task in a smart healthcare infrastructure. In the literature, various approaches have been reported to address this issue. However, most of these approaches are either domain-specific or extremely difficult to implement, especially in the resource-constrained environments of IoMT. In this paper, we present two-tier lightweight device and server-enabled data fusion approaches for wearable devices and their server modules, respectively. In these approaches, each device is bound to perform an in-node processing, i.e., local data fusion, on the sensed data values prior to initialization of the transmission process. For this purpose, each wearable device is required to use knowledge of the previously transmitted refined data values. Additionally, the proposed approach is pruned against abrupt changing scenarios, e.g. heart attack, where the frequency of sensed data values drastically fluctuates. Moreover, a non-metric-based data fusion, i.e., global data fusion, is presented to enhance the accuracy of sensed data by removing redundant data values, especially those collected by neighboring devices. Simulation results reflect the exceptional performance of these smart data fusion approaches, i.e., both local and global, in the context of numerous performance evaluation metrics, such as accuracy and precision ratio. \u00c2\u00a9 2023 Elsevier B.V.",

      "abstract": "Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) can detect and communicate with cooperative obstacles through established protocols. However, non-cooperative obstacles pose a significant threat to UAVs during low-flight operations. These obstacles include static obstacles like buildings, trees, or communication towers and dynamic objects like other UAVs. The application of autonomous UAVs in low-altitude surveillance has motivated research into non-cooperative local obstacle avoidance. This paper provides an overview of such solutions that have been proposed within the last decade. Unlike most literature that limits obstacle avoidance to algorithms, this work provides an in-depth review of obstacle avoidance components, namely the perception sensor, techniques, and hardware architecture of the obstacle avoidance system. This review categorizes the non-cooperative obstacle avoidance techniques into four groups: gap-based methods, geometric methods, repulsive force-based methods, and Artificial Intelligence (AI) based methods. This paper provides a comprehensive resource for researchers working on collision-free surveillance by autonomous UAVs at low altitudes. \u00c2\u00a9 2024 Elsevier B.V.",

      "abstract": "Text-based CAPTCHA is widely used as an online security guard, requiring a user to input letters for classifying human and automated software (known as a bot). However, they are still a problem for usability and robustness. This study investigated the effect of letter spacing, disturbing line orientation and disturbing line color on user test and robustness of text-based CAPTCHA. The 240 CAPTCHAS were tested using Thai undergraduate students. The results show that there were no significant differences in user tests for the three factors. For robustness, disturbing line orientation had no significant difference. However, overlapping letter CAPTCHA was the most significantly robust. CAPTCHA with a disturbing line using the same color as the background was more significantly robust than that using the same color as the foreground. Moreover, if no-spacing letter is used, the effect of disturbing line color is statistically significant in robustness while the effect of that became insignificant when a spacing between letter and overlapping letter are used. We recommend that CAPTCHA with no spacing letter and combined with disturbing line using the same color as the background is suitable for users and its robustness. This can be concluded that letter segmenting technique is not too hard for users (passed 88 %) while it is not too easy for bot attacks (passed 39 %). In terms of security, more studies can still be carried on the CAPTCHA to enabled more robustness against new crime technologies. In terms of usability, on other age groups could be consider. \u00c2\u00a9 2024 The Authors",

      "abstract": "The automotive industry is undoubtedly taking giant strides toward a paradigm shift.&nbsp;In essence, wireless network communication and artificial intelligence technologies are stimulating the gradual evolution of the autonomy of intelligent vehicles. This shift causes a divergence in vehicle architecture to become assembled with&nbsp;software-driven rather than mechanical-driven components, producing an integrated connected central unit that perceives and processes the surrounding environment, makes autonomous decisions, and controls the entire vehicle. The emerging vehicular network technologies, including vehicle-to-everything and in-vehicle channels, facilitate wired and wireless bidirectional communication within the vehicle and to other vehicles, infrastructure actors, and the Cloud to integrate it with its surrounding environment in real-time. Despite the promised potential benefits of intelligent vehicles, including improved mobility, driving safety, and economic and environmental gains, such increased network connectivity and complexity expose them to a vast attack surface. Researchers have identified a wide range of internal and external security threats due to connectivity and automation vulnerabilities within the vehicle-to-everything wireless network channels and the lack of core security measures, such as authentication, authorization, and encryption within the in-vehicle network. The dynamic nature of these vehicular networks and their ever-changing threat landscape originate new pressing security challenges that can cause severe safety destruction. In this paper, we propose BoostSec, a novel online security analytics solution that leverages advanced incremental ensemble learning to provide robust, rapid, and adaptive protection of vehicular networks against known and unknown attacks. We further augment the proposed solution with an agnostic interpretability analysis of the results. We conducted extensive experiments on three publicly available benchmark datasets representing vehicular environments in various contexts. The experimental evaluation proves that the proposed framework outpaces current baseline approaches and meets the challenges with remarkable performance, demonstrated by its (1) generalization covering a wide range of attacks across various vehicular network contexts; (2) real-time analysis reflected in efficient computation footprint; (3) adaptability against unseen attacks; (4) robustness against adversarial attacks; and (5) augmented interpretability analysis.",

      "abstract": "Drone technology is advancing rapidly and represents significant benefits during firefighting operations. This paper presents a novel approach for autonomous firefighting missions for Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs). The proposed UAV framework consists of a local planner module that finds an obstacle-free path to guide the vehicle toward a target zone. After detecting the target point, the UAV plans an optimal trajectory to perform a precision ballistic launch of an extinguishing ball, exploiting its kinematics. The generated trajectory minimises the overall traversal time and the final state error while respecting UAV dynamic limits. The performance of the proposed system is evaluated both in simulations and real tests with randomly positioned obstacles and target locations. The proposed framework has been employed in the 2022 UAV Competition of the International Conference on Unmanned Aircraft Systems (ICUAS), where it successfully completed the mission in several runs of increasing difficulty, both in simulation and in real scenarios, achieving third place overall.

      "abstract": "Outstanding steps towards intelligent transportation systems with autonomous vehicles have been taken in the past few years. Nevertheless, the safety issue in autonomous vehicles is critical and remains to be fully solved. Sensor data provide information about the internal status of the system and the impact of its external environment, where the occurrence of sensor data anomalies indicates the existence of potential safety risks. Therefore, in this work, a taxonomy for potential sensor data anomaly sources from the perspective of road vehicle safety is proposed, motivated by the lack of a unified comprehensive taxonomy of sensor data anomaly identification for autonomous vehicles. In this context, sources are divided into; 1) fault or failure of the components or subsystems; 2) failure of the adaptability to the external environment; 3) cyber-attacks; and 4) faults or design deficiencies of sensors. Based on the taxonomy proposed, related works, and in particular, countermeasures for the four potential sources of sensor data anomalies in autonomous vehicles are then reviewed. In the context of providing a comprehensive discussion, other taxonomies of potential sources causing sensor data anomalies for autonomous vehicles and the issue of interpretability of sensor data anomalies are also discussed, providing insight into the strengths of the proposed taxonomy. \u00c2\u00a9 2023",

      "abstract": "Sustainability in our food and fiber agriculture systems is inherently knowledge intensive. It is more likely to be achieved by using all the knowledge, technology, and resources available, including data-driven agricultural technology and precision agriculture methods, than by relying entirely on human powers of observation, analysis, and memory following practical experience. Data collected by sensors and digested by artificial intelligence (AI) can help farmers learn about synergies between the domains of natural systems that are key to simultaneously achieve sustainability and food security. In the quest for agricultural sustainability, some high-payoff research areas are suggested to resolve critical legal and technical barriers as well as economic and social constraints. These include: the development of holistic decision-making systems, automated animal intake measurement, low-cost environmental sensors, robot obstacle avoidance, integrating remote sensing with crop and pasture models, extension methods for data-driven agriculture, methods for exploiting naturally occurring Genotype x Environment x Management experiments, innovation in business models for data sharing and data regulation reinforcing trust. Public funding for research is needed in several critical areas identified in this paper to enable sustainable agriculture and innovation.",

      "abstract": "Drone technology, also known as Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs), has advanced rapidly in the last decade owing to the huge number of users. This approach has an immense opportunity in areas like healthcare, agriculture, and forestry. However, the transmission of digital images via drone technology is associated with vulnerabilities and risks, due to a lack of efficient security solutions. Digital Image Watermarking (DIW) has emerged as a viable solution for digital image transmission in UAV applications. However, achieving robustness, security, and imperceptibility in a watermarking system at the same time is a difficult task. To address the aforementioned concerns, this paper proposes a secure digital image watermarking scheme in the hybrid DWT-SVD domain. The scaling factor is chosen adaptively from the hybrid Harmony-Grey Wolf (H-Grey) optimization algorithm to maintain a balance between imperceptibility and robustness. In addition, a novel symmetric cryptographic-based four-level encryption approach PSMD (Partitioning, Substituting, Merging, Division) is proposed to address UAV image security concerns by using Fibonacci and prime number series to generate two random keys. The proposed encryption scheme provides high security at low computational cost. The experimental results show that the visual quality and robustness are both high (Avg. PSNR = 41.27 dB and Avg. SSIM = 0.99, NC = 0.99, and BER = 0.0008 calculated for 100 images). The subjective and objective experimental analysis indicates that the proposed encryption scheme is highly secure and the computational cost is also low. The average embedding and extraction time is 0.25 s and 0.09 s It is resistant to various image processing attacks. A comparison with some of the most recent popular schemes confirms the scheme's effectiveness. The presented DIW can be used for copyright protection, UAV image transmission applications, military applications, and other purposes. \u00c2\u00a9 2023 Elsevier Ltd",

      "abstract": "Platooning is an essential strategy for exploiting the benefits of connected and autonomous vehicles (CAV). Quantitative research is needed to understand the factors of influence, evaluation indicators, and analytical granularity of the environmental impacts of platooning fully. This study was performed to estimate the energy consumption and emissions impacts of platooning from an aerodynamics perspective under complex urban road conditions using low-cost methodology. Speed, acceleration, spacing, platoon composition, and vehicle position were analyzed. An aerodynamic analysis platform was established based on the lattice Boltzmann method (LBM). Energy and emissions models were developed based on vehicle specific power (VSP) to establish a mapping relationship between operating and environmental impacts. An impact estimation method based on the LBM and VSP is proposed. Vehicle test data were collected for a case study, and multiple scenarios were analyzed. The results show that high speed, low acceleration, and small spacing can improve the environmental benefits of platooning. The most significant benefits were achieved in the following vehicle position of the Bus\u00e2\u0080\u0093Car platoon scenario, with a maximum energy reduction rate of 61.26 % and a maximum emissions reduction of 56.23 %. The study contributes to designing management strategies and trajectory optimization considering the environmental benefits of platooning. \u00c2\u00a9 2023 Elsevier Ltd",

      "abstract": "Safety assessment is an active research subject for autonomous vehicles (AVs) that have emerged as a new mode of mobility. In particular, scenario-based safety assessments have garnered significant attention. AVs can be tested on how they safely avoid hypothetical situations leading to accidents. However, scenarios written by humans based on their expert knowledge and experience may only partially reflect real-world situations. Instead, we are keen on a different technique of extracting statistically significant and more detailed scenarios from sensor data captured during the critical moments when AVs become vulnerable to potential accidents. Specifically, we first render the three-dimensional space around an AV with fixed-sized voxels. Then, we modeled the aggregate kinetics of the objects in each voxel detected by 3D-LiDAR sensors mounted on real test AVs. The Vision Transformer we used to model the kinetics helped us quickly pinpoint critical voxels containing objects that threatened the AV's safety. We traced the trajectory of the critical voxels on a visual attention map to describe in detail how AVs become vulnerable to accidents according to the logical scenario format defined by the PEGASUS Project. We tested our novel method with 250 h of 3D-LiDAR recordings capturing critical moments. We devised an inference model that detected critical situations with an F1-score of 98.26%. For each type of scenario, our model consistently identified the critical objects and their tendency to influence AVs. Given the evaluation results, we can ensure that our data-driven approach yields an AV safety assessment scenario with high representativeness, coverage, expansion, and computational feasibility. \u00c2\u00a9 2023 Elsevier Ltd",

      "abstract": "Autonomous driving offers a convenient and comfortable means of transportation, while the addition of external communication interfaces renders the vehicle communication more vulnerable to cyber attacks. In contrast to conventional attacks, well-designed stealthy attacks are more adept at evading conventional detectors. To address this problem, this paper proposes a robust detector based on controlled invariant subspace to identify stealthy attacks. This paper stands out not only by relying on the vehicle dynamics model for system state estimation, but rather by employing a real-time trajectory space generation method. Our detector develops a rapidly expanding random tree method based on offline incremental learning to generate trajectory subspace, and any trajectories that diverge from this subspace are identified as anomalies. Additionally, this paper designs distance measurement method that combines the linear quadratic regulation algorithm with a radial basis function neural network while also taking into account the vehicle's dynamic performance constraints. To assess the theoretical performance of the proposed detector, this paper presents rigorous proofs that demonstrate the asymptotical optimality of the generated trajectory and the robustness of the stealthy attack detection method based on controlled invariant subspace. Finally, simulation results demonstrate that the proposed robust detector can effectively identify stealthy attacks and outperforms advanced techniques in terms of accuracy and false-positive rate. \u00c2\u00a9 2023 Elsevier Ltd",

      "abstract": "Vision-based topological localization is recently emerging as a promising alternative to metric pose estimation techniques in robotic navigation systems. Contrarily to the latter, which suffer from a quick degradation of their performance under non-ideal conditions (e.g., scenes with poor illumination and low amount of textures), topological localization trades off precise metric positioning with a more robust and higher-level location representation. State-of-the-art works in this direction, however, often neglect the spatiotemporal relationships between poses that are naturally induced by robotic navigation. Furthermore, these techniques are nearly unexplored for autonomous flying platforms. Inspired by these considerations, in this work, we propose a vision-based topological localization approach designed for Micro Aerial Vehicles (MAVs) applications. Our strategy exploits the framework of graph recurrent neural networks to model the spatial and temporal dependencies and estimate the location of the robot with respect to a topological graph representing the environment. We demonstrate with experiments on different sets of scenarios, including scenes that considerably differ from those used in the training phase, that our approach is able to outperform state-of-the-art place recognition baselines. \u00c2\u00a9 2016 IEEE.",

      "abstract": "Landslides are multi-phase mass flows often triggered by incessant rainfall and pose a severe threat to infrastructure and human lives in mountainous regions. A high-quality landslide assessment for a vast geographic expanse is economically unviable. Therefore, this study proposes a multi-scale approach to identify potential shallow landslide zones for a large area using the Transient Rainfall Infiltration Grid-Based Regional Slope Stability (TRIGRS) model, followed by targeted landslide assessment of the resulting vulnerable area and subsequent mass flow using a multi-phase mass flow framework. Finally, a preliminary design of a protective structure implemented as a rigid barrier is carried out based on obstacle flow interaction. A recurring landslide site in Kaliasaur, Uttarakhand, India, is analyzed using a 12.5&nbsp;m resolution Digital Terrain Model (DTM) from the public domain and resampled DTM of 1&nbsp;m resolution obtained from the aerial survey using an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV). Based on the analysis of a 3-day rainfall event, 25.43% of the total area was unstable, and the percentage of landslide ratio class (LRclass) for validation of TRIGRS model parameters was 65.62% which can be referred to as a moderate success rate. The failed mass flow from the unstable zones in Kaliasaur has a maximum height and velocity of 6.93&nbsp;m and 27.1&nbsp;m/s, respectively. A rigid barrier of height 10&nbsp;m adjacent to a national highway (NH-7) reduced the flow velocity by 17.73% and stopped the mass flow satisfactorily. This research advocates a multi-scale approach landslide hazard assessment to build a resilient infrastructure against landslides.",

      "abstract": "The flexible and highly mobile unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) with computing capabilities can improve the quality of experience (QoE) of ground users (GUs) according to real-time service requirements by performing flight maneuvers. In this study, we investigate a task offloading scheme and trajectory optimization in a multi-UAV-assisted system, where UAVs offload a portion of multiple GUs\u00e2\u0080\u0099 computational tasks. The optimization problem is formulated to jointly minimize the energy consumption of UAVs and the task latency of GUs by optimizing trajectory, task allocation and offloading proportion. This paper proposes a heterogeneous multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL)-based approach to solve the issue in high dimensions and limited states, where UAV and GU are treated separately as two different types of agents. Due to the high cost and low sample efficiency of online training of RL algorithms, a generative adversarial network (GAN)-powered auxiliary training mechanism is proposed, which reduces the overhead of interacting with the real world and makes the agent's policy appropriate for real-world execution environment via offline training with generated environment states. Numerical evaluation results demonstrate that the proposed algorithm outperforms other benchmark algorithms in terms of energy consumption and task latency. \u00c2\u00a9 2023 Elsevier B.V.",

The proposed pipeline aims to provide a high-level semantic interpretation of raw vehicle sensory data to derive, in an automated fashion, lane-oriented HD maps of the environment. We first present RoadStarNet, a deep learning architecture designed to extract and classify road line markings from imagery data.

Then, we present how to progress to a graph-based representation that allows modeling complex road line markings\u00e2\u0080\u0099 structures practically, as this representation can be leveraged to produce a Lanelet2 format HD map.

      "abstract": "Background: Phishing is a malicious attempt by cyber attackers to steal personal information through deception. Phishing attacks are often aided by carefully crafted phishing emails, which can go undetected by automated anti-phishing tools due to their limited accuracy. Studies found that user education, training, and awareness can thwart phishing attacks. Understanding diverse interconnected challenges and critical success factors of phishing education, training, and awareness (PETA) approaches can help improve organizations\u00e2\u0080\u0099 defense against phishing. Objective: This study presents a comprehensive, structured view of the challenges and critical success factors of the design, implementation, and evaluation stages of PETA. Method: We have conducted a Multi-vocal Literature Review (MLR) by systematically collecting 53 academic studies and 16 grey studies from popular databases by following a well-known MLR guideline. Results: We identified 20 challenges and 23 critical success factors, some of which involve human-centric and socio-technical factors in PETA. Our findings point out the need for designing explainable anti-phishing systems and developing automated tools and platforms to conduct real-world phishing studies. Conclusion: Our systematic analysis of 69 studies has enabled us to highlight the need for addressing human-centric issues, incorporating users\u00e2\u0080\u0099 knowledge gaps, and adopting personalized approaches in PETA. \u00c2\u00a9 2023",

      "abstract": "Objective: This study aims to understand drivers\u00e2\u0080\u0099 visual attention before and after take-over requests during automated driving (AD), when the vehicle is fully responsible for the driving task on public roads. Background: Existing research on transitions of control from AD to manual driving has mainly focused on take-over times. Despite its relevance for vehicle safety, drivers\u00e2\u0080\u0099 visual attention has received little consideration. Method: Thirty participants took part in a Wizard of Oz study on public roads. Drivers\u00e2\u0080\u0099 visual attention was analyzed before and after four take-over requests. Visual attention during manual driving was also recorded to serve as a baseline for comparison. Results: During AD, the participants showed reduced visual attention to the forward road and increased duration of single off-road glances compared to manual driving. In response to take-over requests, the participants looked away from the forward road toward the instrument cluster. Levels of visual attention towards the forward road did not return to the levels observed during manual driving until after 15\u00c2 s had passed. Conclusion: During AD, drivers may look toward non-driving related task items (e.g., mobile phone) instead of forward. Further, when a transition of control is required, drivers may take over control before they are aware of the driving environment or potential threat(s). Thus, it cannot be assumed that drivers are ready to respond to events shortly after the take-over request. Application: It is important to consider the effect of the design of take-over requests on drivers\u00e2\u0080\u0099 visual attention alongside take-over times. \u00c2\u00a9 2022, The Author(s).",

However, the depth relief of road users and the perspective distortion of the onboard camera induce nonnegligible measurement errors while exploiting UAVs to localize road users. To address this issue, this paper presents a method for accurate road user location estimation in aerial images. First, a deep-learning-based method was employed to detect road users in aerial images using oriented bounding boxes. Then, the localization error induced by the depth relief and perspective distortion was examined and modeled, based on which an error compensation scheme was developed to offset the localization error for each road user so that higher localization accuracy is attainable. Field experiments were conducted to evaluate the proposed method's performance. The results demonstrated a promising accuracy in estimating the location of road users, signifying the method's potential to improve the credibility of UAVs in traffic applications. \u00c2\u00a9 2023 Elsevier B.V.",

      "abstract": "Safety is a critical concern for autonomous vehicles (AVs). Current testing approaches face challenges in simultaneously meeting the requirements of being valid, safe, and fast. To address these challenges, the silent testing approach that tests functions or systems in the background without interfering with driving is motivated. Building upon our previous research, this study first extends the method to specifically address the validation of AV perception, utilizing a lane marking detection algorithm (LMDA) as a case study. Second, field experiments were conducted to investigate the method's effectiveness in validating AV systems. For both studies, an architecture for describing the working principle is presented. The efficacy of the method in evaluating the LMDA is demonstrated through the use of adversarial images generated from a dataset. Furthermore, various scenarios involving pedestrians crossing a road under different levels of criticality were constructed to gain practical insights into the method's applicability for AV system validation. The results show that corner cases of the LMDA are successfully identified by the given evaluation metrics. Furthermore, the experiments highlight the benefits of employing multiple virtual instances with different initial states, enabling the expansion of the test space and the discovery of unknown unsafe scenarios, particularly those prone to false-positive objects. The practical implementation and systematic discussion of the method offer a significant contribution to AV safety validation. \u00c2\u00a9 2023 Elsevier Ltd",

      "abstract": "The Internet of Medical Things (IoMT) is the network of medical devices, software applications, and healthcare information systems used for remote monitoring and delivery of healthcare services. Despite the several advantages of IoMT for today smart healthcare, security issues are growing due to the inadequate computation, limited storage and insufficient self-protection capabilities of IoMT devices. Authentication of IoMT devices is the main requirement to secure IoMT systems. Although, the recent authentication schemes based on tamper-proof decentralized architecture of blockchain technology are robust and enjoy a high level of security, yet they require high computation, more storage, and long authentication time. These issues lead to reduced scalability and time efficiency, which are necessary for large-scale, time-sensitive IoMT systems. To this end, this paper proposes a novel group authentication framework for IoMT Systems. The group authentication scheme is implemented through a four-phase process, including setup, registration, secret construction, and authentication. To enhance both efficiency and scalability, the proposed group authentication framework employs a combination of elliptic curve cryptography (ECC), Shamir's secret sharing (SSS) algorithm, and blockchain-based fog computing technologies. We simulated the proposed framework through the Ethereum platform and Solidity language and its performance is evaluated using the Hyperledger Caliper tool. The simulation experiments of the proposed framework showed that the average latency of authenticating IoMT devices was 0.5 second and the throughput was 400 transactions per second. Our analysis of the proposed framework's performance against other cutting-edge blockchain-based authentication techniques showed that it outperformed them in terms of latency and throughput. A security analysis of the proposed framework was conducted using the widely accepted Automated Validation of Internet Security Protocols and Applications (AVISPA) tool. The formal and informal security analysis demonstrated that the proposed framework is secure and resistant to potential authentication-related attacks. We also noted that the average latency of the proposed framework maintains a fairly narrow range when the number of submitted transactions rises, indicating that it supports the scalability of the IoMT system. \u00c2\u00a9 2023 The Author(s)",

First, to detection attacks, a distributed attack identification filter is constructed for each UAV. Second, two distributed extended state observers are designed to separate and estimate external disturbances and FDIAs. Third, the distributed time-varying formation tracking protocol and defense strategy for attacks is designed by utilizing the estimated information. The formation system is shown to asymptotically track the desired formation and trajectory and meanwhile reject the disturbance and attacks if the expected formation satisfies the feasible condition by stability analysis.

However, the susceptibility of autonomous vehicles to cyberattacks highlights the critical need for protecting the security and dependability of in-vehicular networks (IVNs). This study proposes a lightweight, efficient, and explainable deep learning framework, DeepSecDrive, for early detection of security threats against IVN. DeepSecDrive presents robust feature extractor units designed with deformable convolutions and a lightweight non-local network (LNLN). The former promotes dynamic change of receptive field to enhance extraction of complex features from the traffics of in-vehicle networks, while the latter enables learning contextual representations and non-local relationships in vehicular data. DeepSecDrive integrates Shapley Additive exPlanations to construct multi-level interpretability units, providing local and global explanations for model decisions in terms of feature contributions to the overall performance. Proof-of-concept experiments are conducted to evaluate the efficacy and durability of DeepSecDrive on real-world IVN attacks from Car-Hacking dataset, and the experimental results demonstrate the ability of our model to outperform state-of-the-art detection methods. \u00c2\u00a9 2023 Elsevier Inc.",

      "abstract": "Seasonally frozen ground (SFG) significantly contributes to global carbon sinks. Global warming and anthropogenic-induced disturbances threaten the carbon storage capacity of SFG. Challenges in evaluating the SFG carbon storage potential include the lack of understanding of the control mechanisms of soil organic carbon (SOC) variations and timely spatial estimates of SOC. In this study, we investigated SOC stocks in SFG in the Tibet Autonomous Region, China, in 2020 and 2021. We employed partial least squares structural equation modeling (PLS-SEM) to explore the effect of complex processes (interacting roles of climate, plant physiology and phenology, freeze\u00e2\u0080\u0093thaw cycle, soil environment, and C inputs) on SOC and mapped SOC stocks in the topmost 30 cm. We identified four causal pathways: (1) an indirect pathway representing the effect of climate on plant physiology and phenology through changes in freeze\u00e2\u0080\u0093thaw cycles and soil environment, (2) an indirect pathway representing the effect of climate on C inputs through changes in freeze\u00e2\u0080\u0093thaw cycles, soil environment and plant physiology and phenology, (3) an indirect pathway representing the effect of climate on freeze\u00e2\u0080\u0093thaw cycles, and (4) an indirect pathway representing the effect of climate on the soil environment through changes in freeze\u00e2\u0080\u0093thaw cycles. C inputs exerted the greatest control on SOC. The effect of these factors decreased with increasing soil depth. We used PLS-SEM to generate maps of SOC stocks in SFG at a 500 m resolution with a moderate accuracy. The estimated mean SOC stocks in the 0\u00e2\u0080\u009330 cm layer reached 6.87 kg m\u00e2\u0088\u00922, with a 95% confidence interval ranging from 6.2 to 7.5 kg m\u00e2\u0088\u00922. Our results indicated that it is critical to consider the depth dependence of the direct and indirect effects of environmental factors when assessing the control mechanisms of SOC variations. In this work, we also demonstrated that spatially explicit SOC estimates based on timely investigations are important for assessing C stocks against the background of considerable environmental changes across the Tibetan Plateau. \u00c2\u00a9 2023 Elsevier B.V.",

      "abstract": "The development of digital business models is impacting the traditional value chain for mobility, implying changes as well as future challenges for automotive manufacturers. Taking a Global Value Chain approach, this work analyses the recent evolution, short-term direction, and medium- to long-term future vision of the adoption of digital mobility business models by automotive manufacturers. Results suggest that, while the firms analysed are currently incorporating relevant business models through autonomous vehicles, digital platforms, connectivity, and car-sharing, they are mostly focused on marketplace exploitation through digital platforms and services related to connectivity. Key elements for the development of future mobility business models include data collection and management as well as interconnection. At the same time, digitalization is expected to reconfigure not only associated business models but also the relationships among actors within the value chain. These relationships will become more complex for automotive manufacturers, who may lose control of value-added activities and acquire dependence on certain actors such as technology and service partners, which are expected to play a pivotal role in meeting new opportunities. As a result, the decision-making power of value chain participants will likely be more widely distributed. \u00c2\u00a9 2023 The Authors",

      "abstract": "Earthquakes are one of the major natural disaster threats worldwide and directly cause substantial economic losses and many casualties every year. Research on the resource and environmental carrying capacity in earthquake-prone areas is urgently required for regional earthquake relief efforts and post-disaster reconstruction. This study considered Ganzi Tibetan Autonomous Prefecture (Ganzi Prefecture) in Sichuan Province, China, focusing on the impact of the Luding 6.8 Magnitude Earthquake in Ganzi Prefecture in 2022. An evaluation system for the resource and environmental carrying capacity of earthquake-prone areas was established. A total of 23 indicators were selected that cover ecological, social economical, and geological aspects, and the weight of each index was determined by the Analytic Hierarchy Process. The relative ranking of the resource and environmental carrying capacities of each county and city were calculated using the weighted Technique for Order Preference by Similarity to Ideal Solution (TOPSIS). Consequently, the post-disaster reconstruction strategy of Ganzi Prefecture was evaluated and analyzed. The results show that the resource and environmental carrying capacities of each administrative area differ regionally. Evidence shows that the resource and environmental carrying capacity in southeastern Ganzi Prefecture is generally higher than in the northwest, owing to the joint influence of the social economy and ecological and geological environment. This study provides carrying capacity assessment data and support methods for earthquake-prone areas.",

      "abstract": "Ethnopharmacological relevance: Plants and fungi have a long tradition in ethnopharmacology for the treatment of infectious diseases including viruses. Many of these natural products have also been used to combat SARS-CoV-2 infections or symptoms of the post- and long-COVID form, owing to the scarcity of clinically approved therapeutics. Aim of the study: The ongoing threat posed by SARS-CoV-2, along with the rapidly evolving new variants, requires the development of new antiviral compounds. The aim of this study was to identify anti-SARS-CoV-2 herbal and fungal extracts used in traditional medicine against acute respiratory infection, inflammation, and related symptoms. Additionally, we sought to characterize their bioactive constituents. Materials and methods: The antiviral activity and cell cytotoxicity of 179 herbal and fungal extracts were evaluated using two SARS-CoV-2 infection assays in Caco-2 cells. 19 plant extracts with and without anti-SARS-CoV-2 activity underwent detailed dereplication using molecular networking. Results: Extracts from Angelica sinensis (Oliv.) Diels roots, Annona squamosa L. seeds, Azadirachta indica A. Juss. fruits, Buddleja officinalis Maxim. flowers, Burkea africana Hook. bark and Clinopodium menthifolium (Host) Stace aerial parts showed a potent anti SARS-CoV-2 activity (IC50 < 5 \u00ce\u00bcg/ml) with only moderate cytotoxicity (CC50 > 60 \u00ce\u00bcg/ml, Caco-2). By performing the dereplication with a bioactivity-featured molecular network (MN) on the extract library level, rather than on the level of individual extracts, we could pinpoint compounds characteristic for active extracts. Thus, a straight-forward identification of potential anti-SARS-CoV-2 natural compounds was achieved prior to any fractionation or isolation efforts. Conclusions: A sophisticated hyphenation of empirical knowledge with MS-based bioinformatics and automated compound annotation was applied to decipher the chemical space of the investigated extracts. The correlation with experimentally assessed anti-SARS-CoV-2 activities helped in predicting compound classes and structural elements relevant for the antiviral activities. Consequently, this accelerated the identification of constituents from the investigated mixtures with inhibitory effects against SARS-CoV-2. \u00c2\u00a9 2023",

      "abstract": "Unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) path planning can be treated as a nondeterministic polynomial (NP) hard concern or an optimization problem. The conventional approaches are unable to effectively handle these issues due to discontinuity, non-linearity, multi-modality, and inseparability. On the other hand, meta-heuristic algorithms are effective at tackling these issues because they are simple, adaptable, and derivation free. To enhance the performance in a variety of challenging circumstances, this paper proposes a novel Q-learning-based multi-objective sheep flock optimizer with a Cauchy operator (Q-MOSFO-CA) to solve the constrained UAV path planning issues. The multi-objective functions considered here are costs and constraints (threat, terrain, turning, climbing, and gliding constraints) to determine the feasible and optimal path. To avoid the probability of falling into the local optimum and to address the shortcoming of unbalanced convergence and also to maintain the exploitation and exploration capability, the Cauchy operator (CA) is integrated with the sheep flock optimization (SFO) algorithm. The Q-learning model is introduced to balance both the global and local searches. Here, the exploration model performs the global search whereas the exploitation model performs the local search to attain an optimal solution. In the simulation scenario, the statistical analysis is conducted under two scenarios, and some essential measures such as the number of iterations at convergence (NIC), evaluation time (ET), energy consumption, and convergence analysis are determined. The proposed method obtains NIC of 1305 and 1436, ET of 12.8 and 15.2 s, and energy consumption of 20,600 and 21,465 J for both Scenarios 1 and 2, respectively. \u00c2\u00a9 2023 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.",

      "abstract": "This article researches the problem of trajectory tracking for unmanned marine vehicles (UMVs) under disturbances and denial-of-services (DoS) attacks in the wireless channel. An equivalent data-driven model of UMVs with ocean disturbances is established by using partial form dynamic linearization algorithm. The disturbances and the input of UMVs have different pseudo partitioned Jacobean matrix, and the disturbances are estimated by using extended state observer, which improves the immunity of UMVs to disturbances in the environment. It is the first time that the DoS attacks are considered under the data-driven model for UMVs, and a novel data-driven adaptive trajectory tracking control framework is constructed. The article proposes an attack predictive compensation mechanism to mitigate their effects of DoS attacks, which follows the Bernoulli distribution. Based on it, the data-driven adaptive trajectory tracking controller is designed such that the error of trajectory tracking is convergent under DoS attacks and external disturbances. Finally, the effectiveness of the proposed data-driven control scheme and the predictive compensation mechanism is validated through the simulations. \u00c2\u00a9 2023 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.",

      "abstract": "Terrestrial insect-machine hybrid robots have long been discussed as alternatives to artificial centimetre-scale mobile robots. These hybrid robots can possess various functionalities (e.g., localization, object detection) by embedding electronic devices while also benefitting from the insects' robust mobility. However, as insects have relatively low walking speed and insensitivity after repeated electrical stimulation, their motion activeness is hard to maintain at a high level. This study attempts to exploit chemical stimulation to boost the insects' walking activity. The use of methyl salicylate as a chemical booster was examined for improving walking activity. The chemical increased the insects' walking speed by 24.3%, which in turn extended their travel distance and region coverage. Also, methyl salicylate still retained the insects' reaction to the electrical induction. By incorporating the locomotory improvements of methyl salicylate with an electrical stimulation protocol, the hybrid robots could reach a terrain coverage speed of 21.6 cm2/s, much higher than only implementing the electrical stimulation (6.8 cm2/s) or no external stimulation at all (1.2 cm2/s). Overall, this is the first demonstration of methyl salicylate's boosting effect on the insects' activity and improving terrain coverage, filling a crucial gap in practical uses of terrestrial insect-machine hybrid robots. \u00c2\u00a9 2023 Elsevier B.V.",

      "abstract": "Harnessing the energy of deep ocean currents to power deep-sea observation equipment has emerged as a significant focus in recent years. Given the extremely low flow speeds in the deep sea, hydrokinetic turbines need to demonstrate reliable self-starting ability. A novel flexible oscillating hydrokinetic turbine is proposed in the present study to address this challenge. The advantage of the flexible oscillating hydrokinetic turbine lies in the ability to adjust the posture of the flexible blades to create optimal attack angles at different positions. Particle Image Velocimetry measurements are employed to reveal the internal flow field. The results indicate that the incoming flow through the turbine cavity induces two substantial deflections in the inflow and outflow regions, contributing to the generation of significant positive torque. The flexible blades can achieve suitable attack angles at various positions as per the expectations. Especially in the downstream region, the blades adopt a diversion state, thereby avoiding the generation of excessive negative torque. The parametric study was conducted through a water flume and a dynamic testing platform. The results indicate that when the number of blades is six and the installation angle of the blade frame is 20\u00c2\u00b0, the power coefficient of the flexible oscillating hydrokinetic turbine reaches its maximum, exceeding 0.18. A full-process interdisciplinary simulation platform test showed that a flexible oscillating hydrokinetic turbine with a radius of 1 m can self-start in conditions as low as 0.1 m/s. At a flow speed of 0.5 m/s, the turbine can generate over 900 Wh of power per day, enough to power sensors or support an Autonomous Underwater Vehicle's monthly cruise. \u00c2\u00a9 2023 Elsevier Ltd",

      "abstract": "Unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV)-enabled mobile-edge computing (MEC) has been widely applied in Internet of Things networks while the security risk of wireless computation offloading is still a challenging issue due to the openness nature of line-of-sight wireless channels between UAVs and edge devices (EDs). The existing secure offloading methods are not well targeted for video offloading in multi-UAV-enabled MEC networks since the joint potentiality of video distortion characteristics and multi-UAV flexible deployment in enhancing security is not exploited. In this article, we propose a secure video offloading strategy based on deep reinforcement learning (DRL) for a multi-UAV-enabled MEC system with a UAV eavesdropper. A joint optimization problem of resolution adjustment, offloading decision, computing capability allocation, communication resources orchestration, and multi-UAV position deployment is formulated to minimize system energy consumption under the constraints of offloading security, system latency, and users' quality of experience from the aspect of video frame analytic accuracy. Since the formulated problem is a high-dimensional nonlinear mixed-integer NP-hard problem, it is difficult to obtain the optimal solution via traditional optimization methods. To solve it, we propose a DRL algorithm (HRF-TD3) to instruct the agent to approach the optimal solution efficiently. The simulation results show that the proposed algorithm is superior to comparison algorithms in terms of system energy consumption, EDs' energy consumption, and system latency under the condition of wireless offloading security. \u00c2\u00a9 2014 IEEE.",

      "abstract": "The emerging drone swarms are capable of carrying out sophisticated tasks in support of demanding Internet of Things (IoT) applications by synergistically working together. However, the target area may be out of the coverage of the ground station (GS) and it may be impractical to deploy a large number of drones in the target area due to cost, electromagnetic interference, and flight-safety regulations. By exploiting the innate agility and mobility of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), we conceive a mobile relaying-assisted drone swarm network architecture, which is capable of extending the coverage of the GS and enhancing the effective end-to-end throughput. Explicitly, a swarm of drones forms a data-collecting drone swarm (DCDS) designed for sensing and collecting data with the aid of their mounted cameras and/or sensors, and a powerful relay-UAV (RUAV) acts as a mobile relay for conveying data between the DCDS and a GS. Given a time period, in order to maximize the data delivered while minimizing the delay imposed, we harness an $\\epsilon $ -multiple-objective genetic algorithm ( $\\epsilon $ -MOGA)-assisted Pareto-optimization scheme. Our simulation results demonstrate that the proposed mobile relaying is capable of delivering more data. As specific examples investigated in our simulations, our mobile relaying-assisted drone swarm network is capable of delivering 45.38% more data than the benchmark solutions, when a stationary relay is available, and it is capable of delivering 26.86% more data than the benchmark solutions when no stationary relay is available. \u00c2\u00a9 2014 IEEE.",

      "abstract": "In this article, a multiunmanned aerial vehicle-mobile-edge computing (UAV-MEC) network is proposed for mobile devices (MDs) located far from a terrestrial base station (BS)-MEC. In the UAV-MEC network, the MDs offload tasks to the UAV-MECs, followed by task offloading from the UAV-MECs to the BS-MEC. Each UAV-MEC aims to jointly optimize its energy consumption, queue stability, and the energy consumption of the MDs by controlling its trajectory and offloading ratio. Specifically, the trajectories of the UAV-MECs are controlled to locate themselves at the optimal positions where the transmission energy of the MDs is minimized. Additionally, the UAV-MECs consider the constraints of task processing time and queue stability in determining the amount of task to be offloaded. Thus, an independent proximal policy optimization (IPPO)-based offloading and trajectory control learning model (IM) is proposed to solve these problems, and a convex optimization model (CM) is also presented to show the optimality of the proposed IM. Specifically, in IM, a near-optimal trajectory control for the randomly located MDs is enabled by exploiting channel gain information only without resorting to accurate location information of the MDs. Furthermore, a dynamic offloading ratio control of each UAV-MEC is achieved by considering its queue dynamics. The simulation results show that the proposed IM jointly optimizes energy consumption and queue stability. Consequently, it outperforms other deep reinforcement learning (DRL)-based algorithms by achieving low energy consumption and long service duration. Moreover, it achieves similar performance to CM while requiring remarkably less time on action decision. \u00c2\u00a9 2014 IEEE.",

      "abstract": "In this article, to enhance the communication quality of cognitive unmanned aerial vehicle networks (CUAVNs), we investigate the intelligent reflecting surface (IRS)-Assisted CUAVNs, where a leading UAV (LUAV) is deployed for sensing spectrum and a group of following UAVs (FUAVs) transmit data to LUAV with the aid of IRS. Our objective is to maximize the achievable throughput of CUAVNs by jointly optimizing sensing duration, IRS passive beamforming, and LUAV's 3-D location, where LUAV's 3-D location is restricted by IRS, FUAVs, and primary user. For the IRS-Assisted single FUAV case, the intractable nonconvex optimization problem is resolved into three subproblems, which are solved by utilizing the bisection search method, the closed-form expression of the optimal IRS phase shift matrix and the successive convex approximation method, respectively. Finally, an efficient alternating optimization algorithm is developed to obtain a high-quality suboptimal solution. By exploiting the solutions of single FUAV, we further propose the throughput weighted sum (TWS) algorithm to solve the intricate nonconvex problem in IRS-Assisted multiple FUAVs case. To further reduce the complexity of TWS, the low-complexity location weighted sum (LWS) algorithm is proposed. Numerical results show that compared to the scheme without IRS assistance, the achievable throughput increases about 102% with the proposed single FUAV scheme, and over 88% with the proposed TWS-based multiple FUAVs scheme. Moreover, the performance gap between the low-complexity LWS and the TWS is less than 7%. \u00c2\u00a9 2014 IEEE.",

      "abstract": "Bad weather or environmental factors, particularly in remote mountain areas, may result in unsafe driving conditions and consequently road traffic accidents. As the deployment of large-scale sensing nodes for reporting road conditions is too expensive, the crowdsourcing method or reporting by sensors in vehicles themselves will be easier to deploy and more practical. However, those participant sensing methods impose some difficulties, such as fake information, reporter misbehavior, and timeliness. Thus, we propose a tri-blockchain-based Internet of Vehicles system, called TriBoDeS, to facilitate real-time information detection and sharing. It is designed to guarantee concurrency and security to dynamically store, manage, and share information uploaded by vehicles with great efficiency. Such information will be announced on the blockchain under the autonomous identification of vehicles in low-trust conditions. In order to ensure the software's security, TriBoDeS can monitor the software's state, detect identified malicious activities, and respond accordingly. To ensure data security, a role-based management mechanism is introduced to achieve fine-grained control over permissions, and confidence rules are established to guarantee the authenticity of the data. To demonstrate the applicability of the proposed scheme, we evaluate its performance (e.g., computing and communication overheads) and security (e.g., resiliency against common attacks) over a consortium blockchain. The experimental results demonstrate that, under the conditions of a sufficient number of vehicles, the TriBoDeS system is capable of real-time information sharing while ensuring the security of user information. Compared to conventional single-chain systems, the TriBoDeS system achieves a 2.75-time improvement in efficiency. \u00c2\u00a9 2014 IEEE.",

Meanwhile, there exists one UAV acting as an eavesdropper which can perform pilot spoofing attack. Considering a mixture of Rayleigh and Rician fading channels, the APs, respectively, perform minimum mean-square error estimation and distributed conjugate beamforming for uplink training and downlink data transmission. Using the random matrix theory, the closed-form expression for a tight lower bound on the achievable secrecy rate is derived, which enables the impact analysis of key parameters, such as power, antenna configuration, UAV height, etc. Taking into account both performance and complexity, a novel pilot assignment scheme is proposed by combining the weighted graphic framework and genetic algorithm, which can actualize global search with limited iterations. The max-min PC with security constraints is then studied in parallel, which can not only enhance the network fairness but also ensure the security. Accordingly, successive convex approximation and fractional optimization are jointly utilized to solve this nonconvex problem. Simulation results numerically verify the analytical results and indicate the superiority of the proposed pilot assignment and PC schemes. \u00c2\u00a9 2014 IEEE.",

      "abstract": "Breeders have made important efforts to develop genotypes able to resist virus attacks in sweetpotato, a major crop providing food security and poverty alleviation to smallholder farmers in many regions of Sub-Saharan Africa, Asia and Latin America. However, a lack of accurate objective quantitative methods for this selection target in sweetpotato prevents a consistent and extensive assessment of large breeding populations. In this study, an approach to characterize and classify resistance in sweetpotato was established by assessing total yield loss and virus load after the infection of the three most common viruses (SPFMV, SPCSV, SPLCV). Twelve sweetpotato genotypes with contrasting reactions to virus infection were grown in the field under three different treatments: pre-infected by the three viruses, un-infected and protected from re-infection, and un-infected but exposed to natural infection. Virus loads were assessed using ELISA, (RT-)qPCR, and loop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP) methods, and also through multispectral reflectance and canopy temperature collected using an unmanned aerial vehicle. Total yield reduction compared to control and the arithmetic sum of (RT-)qPCR relative expression ratios were used to classify genotypes into four categories: resistant, tolerant, susceptible, and sensitives. Using 14 remote sensing predictors, machine learning algorithms were trained to classify all plots under the said categories. The study found that remotely sensed predictors were effective in discriminating the different virus response categories. The results suggest that using machine learning and remotely sensed data, further complemented by fast and sensitive LAMP assays to confirm results of predicted classifications could be used as a high throughput approach to support virus resistance phenotyping in sweetpotato breeding. \u00c2\u00a9 2023",

      "abstract": "This work presents an event-triggered mechanism-based distributed fractional-order fault-tolerant control (FTC) paradigm for multiple unmanned aerial vehicles (multi-UAVs) subject to full-state constraints. Distinct from the existing control solutions for multi-UAVs with constant constraints and symmetric constraints, the time-varying asymmetric constraints considered in this paper are more suitable for practical requirements. Neural networks are exploited to cope with uncertainties arising from unknown nonlinear dynamics. By cleverly combining speed functions with nonlinear state-dependent functions, a novel distributed FTC protocol is established to drive the system states into the boundary functions within a predetermined finite time. Simultaneously, fractional-order calculus is introduced to provide additional adjustment of control parameters, and an event-triggered mechanism is derived to reduce the update frequency of the control signal. It is testified that all signals of each follower UAV are semi-globally uniformly ultimately bounded, and all follower UAVs can follow the attitudes of the leader UAV. In the end, case studies are reported to corroborate the outperformance of the proposed methodology.",

      "abstract": "Ground Penetrating Radar (GPR) systems on board Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) have been successfully used for subsurface imaging applications. Their capability to detect buried targets avoiding the contact with the soil turn these systems into a great solution to detect buried threats, such as landmines and Improvised Explosive Devices (IEDs). Significant advances have been also conducted to enhance the detection capabilities of these systems, complementing the Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) processing methods with several clutter mitigation techniques. However, the improvement in the scanning throughput (i.e., increasing the inspected area in a given time) remains a significant challenge. In this regard, this article compares several scanning strategies for UAV-mounted multichannel GPR-SAR systems using antenna arrays. In particular, two different scanning strategies have been compared: a uniform scheme and a non-uniform strategy called 3X. In addition, different across-track spacing values to generate dense and sparse sampling distributions were considered for each scanning scheme. After conducting a theoretical analysis of these strategies, they have been experimentally validated with measurements gathered with a portable scanner and during flights in realistic scenarios. Results show that the dense configurations of both scanning strategies yield good quality images of buried targets while improving the scanning throughput (compared to a single-channel architecture). In particular, the dense uniform scheme (with a 20 cm across-track spacing) achieves a greater reduction in the inspection time, compared to the dense 3X strategy, at the expense of a slightly smaller signal to clutter ratio.

      "abstract": "After researchers devoted considerable efforts to developing 5G standards, their passion began to focus on establishing the basics for the standardization of 6G and beyond. The utilization of millimeter wave (MMW) and terahertz (THz) frequency bands, combined with sensors and artificial intelligence (AI), has gained significant attention in the research community for the development of the next generation of sensory and radio access networks (NG-SRANs). Leveraging the advantages of communication and sensor systems' common characteristics will open horizons for merging the two networks, thereby creating a unified perceptive and intelligence network. Overall, while using MMW and THz frequencies is certainly valuable, the ability to gather and transmit data in real-time makes sensors extremely effective in communication networks. In contrast, AI, machine learning (ML), and deep learning (DL) have become predominant methods for solving data analysis problems across a wide range of domains, such as analyzing large amounts of different sensor data, decision-making, channel estimation, self-organization, and self-healing. This paper proposes a novel design for a potential 6G network and beyond called the Hydra radio access network (H-RAN) perceptual networks architecture, which is designed based on NG-SRAN. From a design perspective, H-RAN aims to merge communication and sensing networks into a single network in which two functionalities are attempted to mutually complement each other, namely communication-aided sensing and sensing-aided communications networks. However, such a network provides an adequate platform for a wide range of AL/ML algorithms, such as real-time decision-making, self-organization, and self-healing. As a result, H-RAN perceptual networks architecture is expected to be more efficient, reliable, and secure than existing conventional networks, and is likely to play a critical role in a wide range of applications, including but not limited to mobile broadband, sensing systems, smart cities, autonomous vehicles, the internet of things (IoT) connectivity, vehicle-to-everything (V2X) communication, etc. This study gives a detailed overview of how H-RAN will revolutionize conventional future sensors and cellular networks through a comprehensive analysis of H-RAN architectural components and functionalities. \u00c2\u00a9 2013 IEEE.",

In this work, we compare results obtained with a filament-based free wake panel method to experimental and previously validated numerical data. In particular, we study a propeller-wing configuration at zero angle of attack and the aerodynamics of the blade-resolved slipstream interaction with the wing. We use a prescribed wake on the wing and a free wake on the propeller, which greatly accelerate the computations. Results indicate that, while forces are overpredicted due to the inviscid nature of the panel method, the free wake is able to capture the slipstream deformation and shearing with remarkable success. We find that a filament-based free wake panel method can be a useful tool for propeller-wing interaction in preliminary aircraft design. \u00c2\u00a9 2023 The Author(s)",

This paper introduces a novel form of Legendre pseudospectral optimization to solve boundary value problems in UAV trajectory planning. The proposed architecture applies Legendre-Gauss-Lobatto and Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman equations to generate candidate pieces of trajectories with respect to the UAV dynamic constraints. Analytical performance-based solutions are also developed for sample cases to achieve an optimal criterion in trajectory planning. Moreover, the notion of wind soaring is exploited to use the beneficial effects of tailwind velocities in trajectory planning. Integral cost functions are handled by Gauss-type quadrature rules. Simulations demonstrate the efficiency of the pseudospectral method compared with other solvers, in eliminating the difficulties of boundary value problems by employing the boundary points in the interpolation equation. The effectiveness of the proposed approach is demonstrated through dynamic simulations. \u00c2\u00a9 2025 World Scientific Publishing Company.",

Optical, inertial, signals-of-opportunity (SOPs), standalone and augmented Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS), and other modern technologies are used to construct such a system. In fact, the AGV navigation system heavily relies on the usage of GNSS. The key threats or errors of GNSS codHane and carrier phase observations include clock error, orbit error, ionospheric delay, and tropospheric delay. By minimising the errors and employing a relative positioning approach, an AGV may be positioned precisely. When using carrier phase observations, relative location precision up to the cm level is possible. The accuracy of relative position using GPS-L1, GLONASS-G1, BDS-B1, and GPS/BDS/GLONASS integrated system signals for AGV applications is therefore examined in this study work. A software-based framework is also developed to analyse the data and produce relative positioning results. \u00c2\u00a9 2024, Ismail Saritas. All rights reserved.",

      "abstract": "Gullies are common in areas of unconsolidated deposit soil, and relatively steep-sided erosion that spread quickly in depth and width over short periods may occur during heavy or extended rainfall and. Soil erosion has been recognized as the major cause of land degradation worldwide, especially in the East African Rift Valley of Kenya where thick layers of volcanic ash have been deposited. This paper reports the results of studying the evolutionary process of gully erosion and types of gullies in the East African Rift Valley in Kenya over the last 50 years using remote sensing images, field investigations, and UAV (Unmanned Aerial Vehicle) aerial photography. Forward expansion, backward expansion, new gullies, and road culvert gullies were classified according to their morphological evolution characteristics and then identified throughout the history of the valley over the past 50 years. The erosion length increase from forward expansion was the largest of the four categories, followed by backward expansion, new gullies, and road culvert gullies. Human activity and rainstorms are the main factors of gully erosion in the study area. Additionally, four types of gullies were also categorized according to their causes of formation via field investigation and testing: physically-induced gullies, artificially-induced gullies, pipe erosion-induced gullies, and fissure-induced gullies, and artificially-induced and fissure-induced gullies were the most common type of gully in the study area. The evolution of gullies poses a serious threat to the ecological environment since it can lead to grassland degradation, segmentation of landscape ecology, and the erosion of the survival environment of wildlife. In this regard, man-made and fissure-caused gullies are the most severe and should be investigated further. \u00c2\u00a9 2023 Elsevier Ltd",

      "abstract": "Smart cameras are an essential component in surveillance and monitoring applications, and they have been typically deployed in networks of fixed camera locations. The addition of mobile cameras, mounted on robots, can overcome some of the limitations of static networks such as blind spots or back-lightning, allowing the system to gather the best information at each time by active positioning. This work presents a hybrid camera system, with static and mobile cameras, where all the cameras collaborate to observe people moving freely in the environment and efficiently visualize certain attributes from each person. Our solution combines a multi-camera distributed tracking system, to localize with precision all the people, with a control scheme that moves the mobile cameras to the best viewpoints for a specific classification task. The main contribution of this paper is a novel framework that exploits the synergies that result from the cooperation of the tracking and the control modules, obtaining a system closer to the real-world application and capable of high-level scene understanding. The static camera network provides global awareness of the control scheme to move the robots. In exchange, the mobile cameras onboard the robots provide enhanced information about the people on the scene. We perform a thorough analysis of the people monitoring application performance under different conditions thanks to the use of a photo-realistic simulation environment. Our experiments demonstrate the benefits of collaborative mobile cameras with respect to static or individual camera setups. \u00c2\u00a9 2023 The Authors",

      "abstract": "In order to fully exploit the variable wheelbase characteristics of the unmanned ground vehicle (UGV) with variable configuration, this paper proposes an adaptive heading tracking control strategy based on wheelbase changes. This strategy involves adjusting the wheelbase according to different working conditions to optimize various driving performance aspects. Firstly, the impact of changing wheelbase on the response characteristics of sideslip angle and heading angle relative to the front-wheel steering angle is analyzed by using a lateral vehicle dynamic model. The configurations where the 2nd axle moves forward by 0.5 m, remains unchanged, and moves backward by 0.5 m are defined as the \u00e2\u0080\u0098stable configuration\u00e2\u0080\u0099, \u00e2\u0080\u0098balanced configuration\u00e2\u0080\u0099, and \u00e2\u0080\u0098maneuverable configuration\u00e2\u0080\u0099, respectively. Considering time lag effects of hydraulic systems and external random noise interference, a robust-active disturbance rejection control (r-ADRC) method is developed by incorporating a robust term into active disturbance rejection control (ADRC) in order to achieve desired front-wheel steering angle. Additionally, a torque distribution method based on the tire load rate and the real-time vertical load of each wheel is applied to ensure uniform tire wear and enhance longitudinal driving stability. Finally, simulations under various typical working conditions as well as scaled prototype experiments are conducted, and both the theory behind the changing wheelbases and the effectiveness of proposed control strategy are verified. According to different vehicle configurations and mission requirements, the maneuverability and stability of the ground unmanned vehicle are ensured respectively. \u00c2\u00a9 2023",

      "abstract": "Nonadherence to therapy negatively impacts mortality and quality of life and results in suboptimal efficacy of treatment regimens, threats to patient safety, and increased healthcare costs for disease management. Mobile health solutions can offer users instruments that can promote therapeutic adherence. The objective of this review is to investigate the impact mobile health systems have on therapeutic adherence. Specifically, we want to map the main systems used, the functions implemented, and the different methods of adherence detection used. For this purpose, a scoping review was conducted. The following databases were consulted: PubMed, Cochrane Library, EBSCO, including English-language studies published in the last 10 years (2012-2022). The main mobile health systems used are as follows: applications, automated messaging, interactive voice response, and mobile video games. The main features implemented to support medication management were as follows: reminders, self-monitoring instruments, educational support, and caregiver involvement. In conclusion, the use of interactive mobile health instruments intended for use by the patient and/or caregiver can improve objectively and subjectively detected therapeutic adherence. The use of these systems in the therapeutic pathway of users, with a special focus on people with comorbidities and in polypharmacy treatment, represents a challenge to improve caregiver health.

      "abstract": "The strain clamps and leading wires are important components that connect conductors on overhead transmission lines and conduct current. During operation, poor contact between these components can cause abnormal overheating, leading to electric failures and threatening power system reliability. Recently, the use of unmanned aerial vehicles equipped with infrared thermal imagers for strain clamp and leading wire maintenance has become increasingly popular. Deep learning-based image recognition shows promising prospects for intelligent fault diagnosis of overheating faults. A pre-treatment method is proposed based on dynamic histogram equalisation to enhance the contrast of infrared images. The DeepLab v3+ network, loss function, and existing networks with different backbones are compared. The DeepLab v3+ network with ResNet101 and convolutional block attention module added, and the Focal Loss function achieved the highest performance with an average pixel accuracy of 0.614, an average intersection over union (AIoU) of 0.567, an F1 score of 0.644, and a frequency weighted intersection over union of 0.594 on the test set. The optimised Atrous rates has increased the AIoU by 12.91%. Moreover, an intelligent diagnosis scheme for evaluating the defect state of the strain clamps and leading wires is proposed and which achieves a diagnostic accuracy of 91.0%. \u00c2\u00a9 2024 The Authors.

      "abstract": "Breast cancer is an extremely serious and lethal form of cancer. It is the second most common cancer among Indian women in rural areas. Early breast cancer detection can considerably enhance the effectiveness of treatment. Early detection of symptoms and signs is the most important technique to effectively treat breast cancer, as it enhances the odds of receiving an earlier, more specialist care. As a result, it has the possibility to significantly improve survival odds by delaying or entirely eliminating cancer. Mammography is a high-resolution radiography technique that is an important factor in avoiding and diagnosing cancer at an early stage. Automatic segmentation of the breast part using mammography pictures can help reduce the area available for cancer search, while also saving time and effort compared to manual segmentation. Previous studies have utilized convolutional and deconvolutional neural networks with autoencoder-like architecture (CN-DCNN) to perform automated breast region segmentation in mammography images. We present Automatic SegmenAN, an end-to-end unique adversarial neural network for the task of segmenting medical images, in this paper. Image segmentation necessitates extensive, pixel-level labeling, a standard GAN's discriminator's single scalar real/fake output may be inefficient in providing steady and appropriate gradient feedback for the networks. Our approach entails using a novel adversarial critic network and a multi-scale L1 loss function to prompt the critic and segmentor for acquiring local as well global features which encompass spatial relationships among pixels at both short and long ranges, instead of employing a segmentor which is a fully convolutional neural network. We demonstrate that an Automatic SegmenAN perspective is more up to date and reliable for segmentation tasks than any latest U-net segmentation technique.",

      "abstract": "Ecosystem functions and services are severely threatened by unprecedented global loss in biodiversity. To counteract these trends, it is essential to develop systems to monitor changes in biodiversity for planning, evaluating, and implementing conservation and mitigation actions. However, the implementation of monitoring systems suffers from a trade-off between grain (i.e., the level of detail), extent (i.e., the number of study sites), and temporal repetition. Here, we present an applied and realized networked sensor system for integrated biodiversity monitoring in the Nature 4.0 project as a solution to these challenges, which considers plants and animals not only as targets of investigation, but also as parts of the modular sensor network by carrying sensors. Our networked sensor system consists of three main closely interlinked components with a modular structure: sensors, data transmission, and data storage, which are integrated into pipelines for automated biodiversity monitoring. We present our own real-world examples of applications, share our experiences in operating them, and provide our collected open data. Our flexible, low-cost, and open-source solutions can be applied for monitoring individual and multiple terrestrial plants and animals as well as their interactions. Ultimately, our system can also be applied to area-wide ecosystem mapping tasks, thereby providing an exemplary cost-efficient and powerful solution for biodiversity monitoring. Building upon our experiences in the Nature 4.0 project, we identified ten key challenges that need to be addressed to better understand and counteract the ongoing loss of biodiversity using networked sensor systems. To tackle these challenges, interdisciplinary collaboration, additional research, and practical solutions are necessary to enhance the capability and applicability of networked sensor systems for researchers and practitioners, ultimately further helping to ensure the sustainable management of ecosystems and the provision of ecosystem services. \u00c2\u00a9 2023 The Authors.

      "abstract": "With the growing threat of unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) intrusions, the topic of anti-UAV tracking has received widespread attention from the community. Traditional Siamese trackers struggle with small UAV targets and are plagued by model degradation issues. To mitigate this, we propose a novel searching region-free and template-free Siamese network (SiamSRT) to track UAV targets in thermal infrared (TIR) videos. The proposed tracker builds a two-stage Siamese architecture with the former providing detection of the first-frame ground truth by using a cross-correlated region proposal network (C-C RPN) and the latter providing detection of previous-frame predictions via a similarity-learning region convolutional neural network (S-L RCNN). In both stage, global proposals are acquired by region of interest (ROI) alignment operation to break the limitation of searching region. Then, a spatial location consistency function is introduced to suppress background thermal distractors and a temporal memory bank (TMB) is utilized to avoid template update degradation problem. Further, a single-category foreground detector (SCFD) is designed to independently predict the position of the UAV target. SCFD can re-initialize the tracker without the given target in the first frame, which can help to recover the tracking failures. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that SiamSRT achieves the best performance compared to the most advanced algorithms in the anti-UAV tracking missions. \u00c2\u00a9 1980-2012 IEEE.",

      "abstract": "Autonomous vehicles require a real-time positioning system with in-lane accuracy. They also require an autonomous onboard integrity monitoring (IM) technique to verify the estimated positions at a pre-defined probability. This can be computationally demanding. PPP-RTK is a promising positioning technique that can serve this purpose. Since PPP-RTK is developed to process undifferenced and uncombined (UDUC) observations for both network and user sides, it provides the residuals of the individual measurements. This can be exploited to reduce the computational load consumed in the fault detection and exclusion (FDE) process, included in the IM task, without compromising the positioning availability. This research proposes filtering the faulty satellites by the network, then the hardware and location-dependent faults at the user end can be identified. This is achieved by calculating the ratio between the matching UDUC residuals of the user receiver and the nearest reference station observations. This ratio is used to rank the individual observations where the observation with the largest ratio is most likely to be the faulty one. Therefore, it is more likely to identify the faulty observation without generating and testing numerous subsets. In addition, the exclusion can be attempted per observation, which preserves observation availability, unlike the grouping techniques that perform the exclusion per satellite. The method was examined in two test cases where geodetic and commercial receivers were used. Results show that the computational load has been reduced significantly by about 85\u201399% compared to the solution separation and Chi-squared test methods that are commonly used for FDE.",

      "abstract": "Gls UUV is an intelligent underwater platform that can operate autonomously. However, it is difficult for unmanned underwater vehicle (UUV) to make correct decisions timely and independently in the face of uncertain events. Therefore, it is necessary to assess the threat of uncertain events and guide UUV to make timely and accurate decisions. This article studies the threat assessment strategy of a human-in-the-loop UUV under uncertain events. First, the uncertain events are classified according to their characteristics, and the Bayesian network (BN) is constructed by taking the characteristic variables of uncertain events as neurons. Then, the human experiences are combined with the genetic optimization algorithm to determine the BN parameters. According to the reasoning of the BN, the threat of uncertain events is evaluated. Finally, according to the threat assessment results, the PSO and A/B model are used to replan the task. The proposed algorithm uses BN to represent uncertain events and introduces human experiences to optimize network parameters, eliminating subjective bias and improving the accuracy of threat assessment. At the same time, the task replanning strategy is introduced to ensure the security of UUV. Four typical UUV tasks are designed, and the trigger elements of uncertain events are set in the simulation to verify the performance of the proposed algorithm. The simulation and experiment results show that a UUV can accurately assess the threat level of uncertain events during the task execution process when using the proposed strategy. The safety of the human-in-the-loop UUV operation is guaranteed by task replanning. \u00c2\u00a9 2013 IEEE.",

Firstly, an adaptive memory-based event-triggering communication mechanism (METCM) is designed to save networked resources in maritime environment. Second, the signals released by the communication mechanism are quantized to further reduce the bandwidth of the communication network. In addition, since adversary may have multiple attack strategies, thus a hierarchical semi-Markov process (HS-MP) is presented to capture the phenomenon of switching DoS attacks, which makes the attack model more realistic. Further, sufficient conditions are proposed for the finite-time boundedness (FTB) of the UMV system and some linear matrix inequalities are solved to determine the finite-time bounded controller gain. Finally, the effectiveness of the proposed control method is demonstrated by a simulation example. IEEE",

Nevertheless, the use of FFF for aerospace and aeronautical applications is often impeded by the inadequate surface finish it imparts to the produced components. This work aims to demonstrate that, with careful calibration of process parameters and build orientation, FFF can produce aerospace components with low surface roughness. This could enable FFF to be used in aeronautics, allowing the benefits of lightweighting structures using metal replacement thermoplastics and variable infill to be exploited. In this study, rudder sections of a UAV tailplane were produced using FFF and lightened through variable internal infills, thin thicknesses, and a polymer for metal replacement. By setting different printing processes, such as infill percentage and orientation, a configuration with 10% of linear infill which results in a 97.5 g component was identified that exhibits suitable surface roughness for aerospace applications and a weight saving of approximately 50% compared to an equivalent metal volume.",

      "abstract": "Post-disaster scene understanding frameworks are increasingly crucial in Search And Rescue (SAR) operations. Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) provide an efficient means to carry out the task of scene understanding due to the higher altitudes at which they function. However, complex environments in post-disaster scenarios make it difficult for UAVs to detect humans or objects accurately. Inefficient object detection mechanisms lead to low accuracy for object detection tasks. Hence, to mitigate these issues, we propose a UAV and GAN-aided Ensemble Network (UGEN) framework for efficient ORAN-based post-disaster survivor detection. This approach deploys a Context-Conditional Generative Adversarial Network (CCGAN)- based model to remove occlusion in the images obtained from the UAVs. The UGEN framework classifies entities present in the visual scope of the UAV using a semantic segmentation framework deployed on the CCGAN-enhanced images, resulting in a pixel-level prediction of entities present in the post-disaster images. An ensemble network comprising a combination of single-stage and multi-stage detectors detects survivors present in the post-disaster scenario, thereby combining the benefits of both architectures, resulting in a reduced false negative rate and improved performance. An Open Radio Access Network (ORAN) executes data propagation between the UAV and the ground station for reduced transmission latency. The proposed model achieved a survivor detection accuracy of 96.7%. Authors",

      "abstract": "Logistics drones are theoretically advantageous in automating last-mile delivery activities, but practically challenging in urban environments, including public concerns about risk of crashes and privacy. In view of the above concerns existing in the trajectory planning of logistics drones, this paper presents a parallel automatic delivery model following the cyber-physical social system (CPSS) for the last mile delivery of superchilling products, revealing the social value of logistics drone operations. Considering the operational constraints of logistics drone, a multi-objective optimisation model is established to balance the social value, energy efficiency and productivity of using logistics drones in the last-mile superchilling delivery. To effectively achieve the above optimisation, improved strategies, including the material exchange mechanism based on the random proportion rule and the Universe-Particle search strategy, are developed, resulting in an improved two-stage heuristic algorithm. Finally, simulation experiments are carried out in a simulated environment with 154 buildings, and compared with other frontier algorithms used for unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) trajectory planning. The results show that the proposed framework can effectively reduce the threats to public life safety and improve the energy efficiency of logistics drones, while ensuring the productivity in the delivery process. \u00c2\u00a9 2023 Elsevier Ltd",

Most existing methods for damper defect detection are based on deep learning. However, these methods face challenges when applied to unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV)-captured images of dampers, as they often appear in complex backgrounds and contain small and densely distributed objects. This research aims to improve the accuracy and speed of damper defect recognition by proposing an attention-guided damper defect detection network called DSA-Net, which includes components such as damper attention (DA), Stile path aggregation network (Stile PAN), and ASFFs. First, to accurately extract the features of the damper while reducing background interference, a novel attention mechanism called DA is introduced, based on the shape of the damper and bidirectional stripe convolution. This mechanism allows the network to focus on key regions in the image without incurring expensive computational costs. Second, the Stile PAN feature fusion structure is employed to integrate shallow-level information of small targets. Finally, a single-layer ASFFs structure is utilized to autonomously learn information about small and densely distributed targets from the detection feature maps output by Stile PAN. On the transmission line damper (TLD) dataset, DSA-Net achieves an mAP0.5 of 0.935, an mAP0.5:0.95 of 0.789, and an inference speed of 7.2 ms. \u00c2\u00a9 2023 IEEE.",

Our approach integrates blockchain with OppCL to streamline the learning of autonomous vehicle models while addressing data privacy and trust challenges. We deploy resilient countermeasures, incentivized mechanisms, and a secure gradient distribution to combat single-point failure verification attacks. Additionally, we integrate the Byzantine fault-tolerant algorithm (BFT) into the node verification component of the delegated proof of stake (DPoS) to minimize verification delays. We validate our approach through experiments on the MNIST, SVHN, and CIFAR-10 datasets, showing convergence rates and prediction accuracy comparable to traditional OppCL approaches.",

      "abstract": "On October 11 and November 3, 2018, two large landslides occurred at the same location in Baige Village, eastern Tibet, China. These landslides pose a serious threat to both upstream and downstream areas, raising great concerns in China and worldwide. Currently, the influencing factors and fundamental mechanism of the Baige landslide are questioned, and further research is needed. Multiple methods, including comprehensive field investigation, satellite remote sensing, unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) 3D imaging, and geographical information systems, are used to analyze the main characteristics, influencing factors, and fundamental mechanism of the Baige landslide. The results reveal that the occurrence of the Baige landslide is closely related to deep-seated gravitational slope deformations (DSGSDs); tectonic activity, river incision, earthquakes, and rainfall are also responsible for the formation of the event. From a long-term perspective, DSGSDs, active tectonic deformation, repetitive seismic activities, rapid river incision, and sustained rainfall infiltration all interact with each other and finally trigger catastrophic landslides. The damage deformation process of the Baige landslide can be divided into three stages: epigenetic deformation, time-dependent deformation, and failure. Some unstable rock masses still exist in the source area, and thus, successive deformation monitoring and timely mitigation measures should be implemented to reduce the residual risks. The research in this paper is meaningful for further research on such large-scale landslides along the Jinsha River.",

Traditional docking and recovery techniques for AUVs, however, can be inefficient. Therefore, the development of a dynamic underwater recovery mechanism for AUVs is now needed. Recent research has investigated the symbiotic relationship between the remora fish and the shark from a hydrodynamic perspective. Numerical simulations have demonstrated that by exploiting the boundary layer and adverse pressure gradient regions around the shark, the resistance experienced by remora fish can be significantly reduced. Inspired by this, an AUV was designed, and numerical simulations were conducted to investigate the impact of various attachment locations. Moreover, simulations were performed to investigate the hydrodynamic characteristics of the AUV during the docking process, specifically when it enters the boundary layer of the submarine and approaches it. The boundary layer flow, which influences the AUV's resistance, can also provide a force that attract the AUV towards the submarine. This research identifies an optimal attachment location and investigates the effects on the AUV when two underwater vehicles of significantly different sizes are in close proximity. It supports further study to develop a dynamic underwater docking operation. \u00c2\u00a9 2023 The Authors",

However, the low quality of these images can present challenges for accurate monitoring. To address this issue, this study proposes a GAN-based model that enhances the resolution of UAV images captured from power transmission lines. This model utilizes a generator with a novel structure and loss function, which enables it to produce high-quality images with detailed edges and textures. In addition, the discriminator uses a new Siamese-network based architecture, making it capable of better distinguishing between real and fake images. Experimental results show that the proposed method outperforms state-of-the-art super-resolution models regarding producing high-quality images with finer details and higher values of PSNR, SSIM, and HaarPSI in shorter training and inference time. \u00c2\u00a9 2023 The Author(s)",

      "abstract": "Background: Red blood cell (RBC) transfusion remains a major treatment for sickle cell disease (SCD). Patients with SCD have a high prevalence of renal impairment and cardiorespiratory disease, conferring risk of transfusion-associated circulatory overload (TACO). Study Design and Methods: We describe an approach, titled euvolemic automated transfusion (EAT), to transfuse SCD patients with severe anemia who are at risk of TACO. In EAT, plasmapheresis is performed using donor RBCs, rather than albumin or plasma, as replacement fluid. Euvolemia is maintained. A retrospective analysis was conducted of patients with SCD who underwent EAT at our institution over a 10-year period, to evaluate the efficacy and safety of EAT. Results: Eleven SCD patients underwent 109 EAT procedures (1\u00e2\u0080\u009359 procedures per patient). The median age was 42 years (IQR = [30\u00e2\u0080\u009349]) and 82% (n = 9) were female. Most (82%; n = 9) patients had severe chronic kidney disease and 55% (n = 6) had heart failure. One (9%) patient had a history of life-threatening TACO. Mean pre- and post-procedure Hct values were 19.8% (SD \u00c2\u00b1 1.6%) and 29.1% (SD \u00c2\u00b1 1.4%), respectively. The average Hct increment was 3.2% per RBC unit. Only two EAT-related complications were recorded during the 109 procedures: central line-associated infection and citrate toxicity (muscle cramping). EAT used an average of two RBC units less than that projected for standard automated RBC exchange. Conclusion: Our findings suggest that EAT is safe and effective to treat patients with SCD and severe anemia, who are at risk for TACO. EAT requires fewer RBC units compared to automated RBC exchange. \u00c2\u00a9 2023 AABB.",

      "abstract": "Owing to their flexibility, fast deployment, increasing affordability, and numerous application opportunities, unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) became an undisputed target of studies and research to discover and exploit the immense opportunities they provide. Moreover, network slicing is a critical enabler for 5G and beyond. Network slices guarantee certain network user expectations such as data rate and latency thresh-holds. There is no doubt that crowd-sourced and incentive driven solutions are on the rise. Crowd-sourcing allowed companies and organizations both small and large to gather data and perform other large-scale tasks with minimum expenses and maintenance. Indeed, the major concerns for 5G and network slicing are guaranteeing high throughput, reliability, and latency. With data rates being the most important attribute for common regular users, that is, mobile devices, video streaming, navigation, and content consumption. As a result, the focus of this work is to utilize crowd-sourced UAVs in an incentive driven network slice assistance system to extend coverage and provide mobile users with the high throughput they require. This work presents some basic 5G cellular radio access technologies and network slicing background and proposes a novel system, namely UAV slice assistance (UAVSA), and its hybrid alternative version: UAV hybrid slice assistance (UAVHSA). The hybrid mode combines benefits from the proposed UAVSA system and the traditional base station (BS) system. The proposed algorithms address the issue of coverage and guaranteeing high data rate slices for users. The proposed systems maximize satisfaction rate of network slice users. Moreover, all systems are extensively tested and compared in various scenarios to determine their performance and provide a coherent study. Finally, future works and opportunities are highlighted in conclusion. \u00c2\u00a9 2023 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.",

Thus, the development of alternative approaches to remediate this environmental threat is urgently needed. Microrobots, combining autonomous motion with great tunability for the development of specific tasks, have turned into promising candidates to take on the challenge. Here, hybrid urchin-like hematite (\u00ce\u00b1-Fe2O3) microparticles carrying magnetite (Fe3O4) nanoparticles and surface functionalization with organic \u00ce\u00b2-cyclodextrin (CD) molecules are prepared with the aim of on-the-fly encapsulation of illicit drugs into the linked CD cavities of moving microrobots. The resulting mag-CD microrobots are tested against methamphetamine (MA), proving their ability for the removal of this psychoactive substance. A dramatically enhanced capture of MA from water with active magnetically powered microrobots when compared with static passive CD-modified particles is demonstrated. This work shows the advantages of enhanced mass transfer provided by the externally controlled magnetic navigation in microrobots that together with the versatility of their design is an efficient strategy to clean polluted waters. \u00c2\u00a9 2024 The Authors.

      "abstract": "In modern warfare, unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) have become a vital military force. Planning feasible paths for UAVs has become an essential part of forming autonomous attack systems. Aiming at the task requirements of fix-wing UAVs, this paper proposes a ball security corridor planning method by combining the ball Said-Ball curve and a novel super eagle optimization algorithm (SEOA). Firstly, the ball security corridor planning model is established by taking the center curve and radius function of the ball Said-Ball (BSB) curve as the flight path and security boundary. It not only considers the smoothness of the flight path, but also reserves enough security range to avoid cumulative errors. Then, a novel super eagle optimization algorithm is proposed to solve the established model with higher accuracy and efficiency. It simulates the hunting process of virtual super eagles with intelligent thinking. For super eagles, two patterns are designed for determining prey at different stages to avoid premature convergence. An information sharing strategy is also introduced to balance the exploitation and exploration abilities. For prey, they can choose orderly and emergency strategies based on emotional function to escape capture to speed up the convergence of SEOA. According to the results of solving the test function in CEC2017, the SEOA has smaller average rank compared to other flying animal-based algorithms and recent popular algorithms. For the solving successful rate, the SEOA reaches 82.7586% and 89.6552%, respectively. Additionally, the results of Wilcoxon rank-sum test statistically prove that the SEOA is a newly developed intelligent optimization method with significantly higher accuracy. Finally, the SEOA is used to solve the established model by optimizing the positions and radii of control balls of BSB curves. Experimental results in three complex simulation scenes show that the flight corridors obtained by SEOA outperform those generated by other algorithms in overall fitness values. This indicates a more rational optimization in flight altitude, distance, smoothness, and security range. Its faster convergence speed can ensure higher efficiency in planning a security corridor satisfying constraints and requirements. \u00c2\u00a9 2024 Elsevier Ltd",

      "abstract": "Background and objective: The adoption of new technologies in clinical care systems has propitiated the availability of a great amount of valuable data. However, this data is usually heterogeneous, requiring its harmonization to be integrated and analysed. We propose a semantic-driven harmonization framework that (1) enables the meaningful sharing and integration of healthcare data across institutions and (2) facilitates the analysis and exploitation of the shared data. Methods: The framework includes an ontology-based common data model (i.e. SCDM), a data transformation pipeline and a semantic query system. Heterogeneous datasets, mapped to different terminologies, are integrated by using an ontology-based infrastructure rooted in a top-level ontology. A graph database is generated by using these mappings, and web-based semantic query system facilitates data exploration. Results: Several datasets from different European institutions have been integrated by using the framework in the context of the European H2020 Precise4Q project. Through the query system, data scientists were able to explore data and use it for building machine learning models. Conclusions: The flexible data representation using RDF, together with the formal semantic underpinning provided by the SCDM, have enabled the semantic integration, query and advanced exploitation of heterogeneous data in the context of the Precise4Q project. \u00c2\u00a9 2023 The Author(s)",

      "abstract": "Commotio cordis is a rare but life-threatening condition characterized by sudden cardiac arrest resulting from a blunt chest impact. While commotio cordis has traditionally been associated with sports-related activities, a significant proportion of cases occur in non-sport-related settings, such as assaults, motor vehicle accidents (MVAs), and daily activities. This critical review examines the epidemiology, clinical characteristics, and outcomes of non-sports-related commotio cordis cases, highlighting the need for increased awareness and improved management in these contexts. The review analyzes existing literature, drawing attention to the demographics of non-sports-related cases, which predominantly affect adolescents and young adults, with males being the primary demographic. In contrast to sport-related cases, non-sports-related commotio cordis cases exhibit a wider age range and a higher proportion of female subjects. Mortality rates are significantly higher in non-sports-related commotio cordis cases, largely due to lower rates of cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR), limited access to automated external defibrillators (AEDs), and delayed initiation of resuscitative efforts compared to sport-related incidents. This underscores the critical importance of increasing awareness and preparedness in non-sport-related settings. To mitigate the risks associated with non-sports-related commotio cordis, efforts should focus on early recognition of the condition, timely administration of CPR, and the widespread availability and accessibility of AEDs in various environments. Enhanced awareness and education can potentially lead to a reduction in mortality and improved outcomes for individuals affected by commotio cordis outside of sports-related activities. In conclusion, commotio cordis is not exclusive to sports and presents a significant health risk in non-sport-related scenarios. This review emphasizes the urgent need for increased awareness, preparedness, and resuscitation measures in non-sports contexts to address the higher mortality associated with these cases. \u00c2\u00a9 2023 Elsevier Inc.",

      "abstract": "An offline and online bi-level structure-based dynamic path planning algorithm is proposed for an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) in low-altitude complex urban environment. First, an improved Hunger Games Search (HGS) algorithm is developed to generate an offline optimized path under the UAV\u00e2\u0080\u0099s performance constraints and the known static obstacles\u00e2\u0080\u0099 constraints. The individuals of the proposed algorithm will be divided into multiple groups to increase the population diversity. And then, a dynamic grouping strategy and a quantum-behaved behavior are proposed to solve the premature convergence\u00e2\u0080\u0099s problem and the imbalance problem between exploration and exploitation ability in HGS. To improve the dynamic obstacle avoidance efficiency of the algorithm, the dynamic obstacles are classified into three categories: newly added no-fly zone, known and unknown dynamic obstacles. Then, utilizing the information of the offline optimized path and the airborne sensors, three kinds of online planning strategies\u00e2\u0080\u0094an improved rapid-exploring random tree (RRT), a changing speed strategy, and a novel three-dimensional rolling windows\u00e2\u0080\u0094are introduced to dynamically update the path or speed of the UAV. Simulation results indicated that the improved HGS can enhance the performances of the traditional HGS and outperform other compared algorithms on the benchmark functions. Meanwhile, the online planning strategies can effectively achieve dynamic obstacle avoidance within the constraints of offline path. More specially, the planning time and angles of the local path to avoid the no-fly-zone\u00e2\u0080\u0099s influence are improved by 11.3% and 56.8% through utilizing the improved RRT. \u00c2\u00a9 The Author(s) 2023.",

In this paper, we propose a dynamic test scenario generation method to evaluate autonomous vehicles by modeling environmental vehicles as agents with human behavior and simulating the interaction process between the autonomous vehicle and environmental vehicles. Considering the multimodal features of traffic scenarios, we cluster the real-word traffic environments, and integrate the scenario class labels into the conditional generative adversarial imitation learning (CGAIL) model to generate different types of traffic scenarios. The proposed method is validated in a typical lane-change scenario that involves frequent interactions between ego vehicle and environmental vehicles.

      "abstract": "In this article, a multi-estimator based computationally efficient algorithm is developed for autonomous search in an unknown environment with an unknown source. Different from the existing approaches that require massive computational power to support nonlinear Bayesian estimation and complex decision-making process, an efficient cooperative active-learning-based dual control for exploration and exploitation (COAL-DCEE) is developed for source estimation and path planning. Multiple cooperative estimators are deployed for environment learning process, which is helpful to improving the search performance and robustness against noisy measurements. The number of estimators used in COAL-DCEE is much smaller than that of the particles required for Bayesian estimation in information-theoretic approaches. Consequently, the computational load is significantly reduced. As an important feature of this study, the convergence and performance of COAL-DCEE are established in relation to the characteristics of sensor noises and turbulence disturbances. Numerical and experimental studies have been carried out to verify the effectiveness of the proposed framework. Compared with the existing approaches, COAL-DCEE not only provides convergence guarantee but also yields comparable search performance using much less computational power. IEEE",

The code is written in Python, exploits available Python libraries, and allows accessible open-source code development. The validation of the integrated algorithms is presented on three case studies that represent the targeted applications: the study of currents for eco-hydraulics, the measurement of low water flows and the diagnosis of hydraulic structures. The field measurements are in very good agreement with the optical measurements and demonstrate the usefulness of the tool for rapid flow diagnosis for all the intended applications. \u00c2\u00a9 2023 Elsevier Ltd",

To make the radar system compatible with the payload requirements of small UAV platforms, the radar electronics are implemented with CMOS technology, and the antenna is implemented as an extremely compact and lightweight metasurface (MTS) antenna. This article will discuss how the high absorption losses of snowpacks lead to dynamic range requirements much stricter than FMCW radars used for automotive and other sensing applications, and how these requirements are met through antenna isolation, leakage calibration and exploitation of the range correlation effect. The article discusses in detail the implementation of the radar system, the CMOS microwave and digital circuitry, and the MTS antenna. The developed radar was mounted on a drone and conducted surveys in both Idaho and Alaska during the 2022-2023 winter season. We present several of those field results. \u00c2\u00a9 2021 IEEE.",

      "abstract": "Objectives: Patients who have recently suffered a transient ischemic attack (TIA) or minor ischemic stroke are at increased risk of cognitive impairment. In the present study, we aimed to investigate the effect of a 1-year exercise intervention on cognitive functioning up to 2 years post intervention. Material and methods: We conducted a single-blind randomized controlled trial to investigate the effect of an exercise intervention on cognitive functioning, compared with usual care, for up to 2 years. Patients with a TIA or minor stroke were randomly allocated to an intervention group receiving the 1-year exercise intervention (n = 60) or to usual care (n = 59). Outcome measures were assessed at baseline and after 1 and 2 years. We measured cognition with neuropsychological tests on three domains: (1) executive functioning, (2) attention-psychomotor speed, and (3) memory. Linear mixed models were used for longitudinal data to determine the effect of the exercise intervention on cognitive functioning. Statistical analyses were performed using IBM SPSS software 24.0. Results: We found that over the two years study period \u00e2\u0080\u0093and corrected for age, sex, and educational level\u00e2\u0080\u0093 the intervention group on average improved significantly more in executive functioning than the control group (\u00ce\u00b2 = 0.13; 95 % CI [0.02 to 0.25]; p = 0.03). No significant intervention effects were found on either memory or attention-psychomotor speed. Conclusions: Our data show that a 1-year exercise intervention significantly improved executive functioning over time, compared to usual care. We recommend that health care professionals consider broadening standard secondary stroke prevention treatment in patients with TIA/minor stroke by adding exercise and physical activity. \u00c2\u00a9 2023 Elsevier Inc.",

      "abstract": "Mushrooms are economically valuable crops of high nutritional value. However, during cultivation they are continually threatened by fungal diseases, even in controlled-condition farm ecosystems. Fungal diseases significantly affect mushroom growth and can rapidly contaminate an entire crop. Farmer inspections can be hazardous to farmer health. This paper contributes an automated fungal disease detection system for the Sajor-caju mushrooms together with an intelligent farm system for precise cultivation environment control. The objective was to create and test a detection system that could detect fungal diseases rapidly, reduce farmer exposure to fungal spores, and alert farmers when fungal disease was detected. The system is composed of three parts: (i) a high-precision environment control system, (ii) an innovative imaging robot system, and (iii) a real-time fungal disease prognosis system using deep learning, with an alarm system. The trial results show that the real-time disease prognosis system has 94.35% precision (89.47% F1-score, n=13,500), and its twice daily inspections detect and report fungal disease typically within 6 to 12 h. The innovative farm\u00e2\u0080\u0099s overall capability for mushroom cultivation (environment control) is regarded as excellent and has precise control (99.6% capability, over 3-months). The innovative imaging robot\u00e2\u0080\u0099s overall operational trial performance is effective (at 99.7%). Moreover, the system effectively notifies farmers via smartphone when a fungal disease is detected. \u00c2\u00a9 2024, King Mongkut's Institute of Technology Ladkrabang. All rights reserved.",

      "abstract": "Federated Learning (FL) is a decentralized machine learning (ML) technique that allows a number of participants to train an ML model collaboratively without having to share their private local datasets with others. When participants are unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), UAV-enabled FL would experience heterogeneity due to the majorly skewed (non-independent and identically distributed -IID) collected data. In addition, UAVs may demonstrate unintentional misbehavior in which the latter may fail to send updates to the FL server due, for instance, to UAVs' disconnectivity from the FL system caused by high mobility, unavailability, or battery depletion. Such challenges may significantly affect the convergence of the FL model. A recent way to tackle these challenges is client selection, based on customized criteria that consider UAV computing power and energy consumption. However, most existing client selection schemes neglected the participants' reliability. Indeed, FL can be targeted by poisoning attacks, in which malicious UAVs upload poisonous local models to the FL server, by either providing targeted false predictions for specifically chosen inputs or by compromising the global model's accuracy through tampering with the local model. Hence, we propose in this article a novel client selection scheme that enhances convergence by prioritizing fast UAVs with high-reliability scores, while eliminating malicious UAVs from training. Through experiments, we assess the effectiveness of our scheme in resisting different attack scenarios, in terms of convergence and achieved model accuracy. Finally, we demonstrate the performance superiority of the proposed approach compared to baseline methods. \u00c2\u00a9 2020 IEEE.",

      "abstract": "Precise real-time unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) positioning is crucial for preventing unauthorized UAVs from damaging cooperative intelligent transportation systems (C-ITSs). However, UAV positioning remains extremely challenging due to the small target size and high flexibility. Therefore, we develop a modal-oriented self-tuning fusion framework for precise UAV millimeter-wave(MMW)-vision positioning. The framework selects and extracts cross-modal features based on modality characters, and migrates the Doppler features of MMW radar data to the image features for precise pixel-level positioning. Based on the framework, a modal-oriented self-tuning fusion network is proposed to adaptively enhance UAV feature without direct supervision by exploiting the cross-modal correlations. A novel characteristic-based 3DMMW feature extraction method is presented to extract UAV Doppler motion characteristics while a self-tuning cross-modal affine transfer is proposed for UAV visual feature enhancement. Due to lack of dataset for our task, we establish a practical positioning platform and two novel datasets containing synchronized visual images and MMW radio frequency (RF) sequences in various scenarios. Experimental results confirm that our framework outperforms the benchmark methods in terms of positioning accuracy while maintaining real-time performance. Moreover, ablation studies also confirm the effectiveness of each module in the framework. \u00c2\u00a9 1983-2012 IEEE.",

To meet the realistic demand of increasing resilience requirements for UAV swarm systems, in this paper, we study the modeling and resilience assessment methods of UAV swarm self-organized networks. First, based on complex network theory, a double layer coupled UAV swarm network model considering the communication layer and the structure layer is constructed. Then, three network topological indicators, namely, the average node degree, the average clustering factor, and the average network efficiency, are used to characterize the UAV swarm resilience indicators. Finally, the UAV swarm resilience assessment method, considering dynamic evolution, is designed to realize the resilience assessment of the UAV swarm under different strategies in multiple scenarios. The simulation experiments show that the UAV swarm resilience assessment, considering dynamic reconfiguration, has a strong correlation with the network structure design.",

Vision-based planners can fail due to adversarial objects or lose generalizability for unseen scenarios, without retraining learned algorithms. In this article, we propose haptic exploration to improve suction cup grasping when visual grasp planners fail. We present the smart suction cup, an end effector that utilizes internal flow measurements for tactile sensing. We show that model-based haptic search methods, guided by these flow measurements, improve grasping success by up to 2.5\u00c3\u0097 as compared with using only a vision planner during a bin-picking task. In characterizing the smart suction cup on both geometric edges and curves, we find that flow rate can accurately predict the ideal motion direction even with large postural errors. The smart suction cup includes no electronics on the cup itself, such that the design is easy to fabricate and haptic exploration does not damage the sensor. This work motivates the use of suction cups with autonomous haptic search capabilities in especially adversarial scenarios. \u00c2\u00a9 2004-2012 IEEE.",

      "abstract": "This paper highlights the significance of Artificial Intelligence (AI) in the realm of drone applications in forestry. Drones have revolutionized various forest operations, and their role in mapping, monitoring, and inventory procedures is explored comprehensively. Leveraging advanced imaging technologies and data processing techniques, drones enable real-time tracking of changes in forested landscapes, facilitating effective monitoring of threats such as fire outbreaks and pest infestations. They expedite forest inventory by swiftly surveying large areas, providing precise data on tree species identification, size estimation, and health assessment, thus supporting informed decision-making and sustainable forest management practices. Moreover, drones contribute to tree planting, pruning, and harvesting, while monitoring reforestation efforts in real-time. Wildlife monitoring is also enhanced, aiding in the identification of conservation concerns and informing targeted conservation strategies. Drones offer a safer and more efficient alternative in search and rescue operations within dense forests, reducing response time and improving outcomes. Additionally, drones equipped with thermal cameras enable early detection of wildfires, enabling timely response, mitigation, and preservation efforts. The integration of AI and drones holds immense potential for enhancing forestry practices and contributing to sustainable land management. In the future explainable AI (XAI) improves trust and safety by providing transparency in decision-making, aiding in liability issues, and enabling precise operations. XAI facilitates better environmental monitoring and impact analysis, contributing to efficient forest management and preservation efforts. If a drone's AI can explain its actions, it will be easier to understand why it chose a particular path or action, which could inform safety procedures and improvements. \u00c2\u00a9 2023 The Author(s)",

      "abstract": "\u00e2\u0080\u0094 As innovative technologies such as autonomous driving, over-the-air technology, and vehicle-to-everything are widely applied to intelligent connected vehicles, people can gain a more convenient and safer driving experience. Although the application of these technologies facilitates our lives, they also bring a series of vulnerable interfaces (such as 5G, Bluetooth, and WiFi), which pose a significant security threat to existing in-vehicle networks. To address these threats, researchers have proposed two mainstream schemes, including message authentication and intrusion detection system (IDS), where the scheme of message authentication needs to occupy the limited bandwidth of controller area network (CAN) bus. Furthermore, most IDSs either cannot locate the sender of the attack, fail to detect aperiodic malicious frames, or require prior knowledge of which CAN identifiers (IDs) belong to which electronic control units (ECUs). To address these weaknesses, we propose a practical voltage-based IDS named IdentifierIDS for real in-vehicle networks. To the best of our knowledge, it is the first scheme to detect intrusions by establishing a voltage fingerprint for each ID without the need for prior knowledge. This allows IdentifierIDS to detect both periodic and aperiodic malicious frames without occupying the limited bandwidth of the CAN bus. As a self-learning IDS, it can adapt to different in-vehicle networks without the need for customization for them. Experiments on three real vehicles demonstrate the robustness of our scheme in different in-vehicle networks. \u00c2\u00a9 2023 IEEE.

      "abstract": "For autonomous robots, it is desirable to learn coordination of primitive skills that can effectively solve long-horizon tasks and perform novel ones. Recent advances in hierarchical policy learning have shown that decomposing complex tasks into sequences of primitive skills which are called sketches can enable robots to perform directed exploration in challenging manipulation tasks. However, they usually fall short in sequencing skills in a new task without retraining as the task sketches are almost hard-coded or learned by deep reinforcement learning. To improve exploration efficiency for long-horizon tasks, we propose Sketch RL, a hierarchical framework that combines supervised learning with reinforcement learning interactively generates the task sketch, and utilizes it as the curriculum to guide low-level skill learning. Furthermore, to allow for multitask decomposition and generalizing few-shot to new tasks, our method exploits a Vision-based Skill Predictor (VSP) to capture shared subtask structure. Extensive experiments on challenging manipulation tasks demonstrate that Sketch RL substantially outperforms other prior baseline methods and is capable of adapting to new tasks with different sketches and real-world settings. \u00c2\u00a9 2016 IEEE.",

      "abstract": "Large Eddy Simulations (LES) of turbulent reacting flows carried out with detailed kinetic mechanisms have a key role for the discovery of the physical and chemical processes occurring in combustion systems, and are essential for the development of efficient, stable, and non-pollutant technologies. Nevertheless, these simulations require a large amount of computational resources, making their utilization for large-scale systems, such as industrial burners and gas turbines, impractical. In this work, we combine state-of-the-art machine learning algorithms and model reduction methods to deliver a fully automated strategy for performing LES with adaptive chemistry. This strategy is based on the Sample-Partitioning Adaptive Chemistry (SPARC) algorithmic procedure, which consists of four steps: the generation of a training dataset, its partitioning in clusters, the generation of a set of reduced chemical mechanisms specifically tailored to each cluster and, lastly, the numerical simulation of the case of interest with adaptive chemistry enabled by an on-the-fly classification of every grid point. The SPARC approach has already been demonstrated to substantially reduce the computational effort of reactive flows simulations. However a non-negligible level of user interventions is needed, upon which the method's success critically depend. Therefore, with the goal of boosting the performance of this workflow and minimise the user-specified degrees of freedom, we plug in and exploit the Local Principal Component Analysis augmented with an automated Bayesian-optimised search for optimal clustering solutions, and the Computational Singular Perturbation method with an additional layer of automation based on the Tangential Stretching Rate for minimally-sized reduced mechanisms. We employ a cheap and easy-to-generate 1-dimensional-flames training database and we demonstrate the efficiency, accuracy and robustness of this strategy with an application to LES of the Adelaide Jet in Hot Coflow (AJHC) burner, a turbulent reacting flow exhibiting intense turbulence-chemistry interactions. \u00c2\u00a9 2023 The Combustion Institute",

      "abstract": "Wheat leaf disease prevention and treatment requires an accurate and rapid classification of wheat leaf diseases and their extent. Using healthy wheat, leaf rust, crown, root rot, and wheat loose smut as research objects, this study proposes a deep learning-based technique for classifying wheat leaf diseases. A collaborative generative adversarial network is used as an image imputation in the proposed methodology, allowing a generator and discriminator network to properly estimate the missing data in the dataset using the residual method. It is used to improve feature extraction in wheat leaf images. The major contribution of this study is to use a pre-trained deep learning convolutional neural network architecture as a foundation to improve and construct an automated tool for wheat leaf disease image categorization. To classify wheat leaf diseases, a modification to the Residual Network with 50 layers (ResNet50) is being suggested. The \u2032Conv\u2032, \u2032Batch Normaliz\u2032, and \u2032Activation Leaky Relu\u2032 layers were added as part of this modification. These layers are inserted into the ResNet50 architecture for accurate feature extraction and discrimination. Extensive tests are carried out to evaluate the proposed model's performance on photos from a large wheat disease classification dataset. The suggested approach outperforms ResNet50, InceptionV3, and DenseNet, according to the experimental findings. The suggested method achieves the greatest identification accuracy of 98.44%. These discoveries might aid in the accurate detection and categorization of wheat leaf diseases.",

      "abstract": "This paper addresses the trajectory-tracking problem under uncertain road-surface conditions for autonomous vehicles. We propose a stochastic nonlinear model predictive controller (SNMPC) that learns a tyre\u00e2\u0080\u0093road friction model online using standard automotive-grade sensors. Learning the entire tyre\u00e2\u0080\u0093road friction model in real time requires driving in the nonlinear, potentially unstable regime of the vehicle dynamics, using a prediction model that may not have fully converged. To handle this, we formulate the tyre-friction model learning in a Bayesian framework and propose two estimators that learn different aspects of the tyre\u00e2\u0080\u0093road friction. The estimators output the estimate of the tyre-friction model as well as the uncertainty of the estimate, which expresses the confidence in the model for different driving regimes. The SNMPC exploits the uncertainty estimate in its prediction model to take proper action when the uncertainty is large. We validate the approach in an extensive Monte Carlo study using real vehicle parameters and in CarSim. The results when comparing to various MPC approaches indicate a substantial reduction in constraint violations, as well as a reduction in closed-loop cost. We also demonstrate the real-time feasibility in automotive-grade processors using a dSPACE MicroAutoBox-II rapid prototyping unit, showing a worst-case computation time of roughly 40 ms. \u00c2\u00a9 2023 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.",

      "abstract": "The combined impacts of rapid urbanization and climate change pose significant threats to global biodiversity. To counter these threats, the establishment of appropriate habitats is becoming pivotal for species preservation. Due to positive ecological interventions, Baer\u2019s Pochard (Aythya baeri), a critically endangered avian species per the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) classification, has made a remarkable resurgence in the wetlands of Baiyangdian (BYD). BYD, located in Xiong\u2019an New Area, central North China, is the largest wetland and an ideal habitat for rare bird species. Our study focuses on identifying ideal habitats within BYD to further its conservation. To this end, unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV) integrated with GPS functionalities were utilized to collect occurrence data for the species. Furthermore, the Google Earth Engine (GEE) provided access to high-resolution, real-time satellite imagery. Our model exhibited substantial reliability, reflected by area under the curve (AUC) values of 0.917 and 0.934 for breeding and migration periods, respectively. During the breeding phase, the prime habitat for Baer\u2019s Pochard spans 162 km2, predominantly encompassing regions like Xiaobaiyangdian (XBYD), Zhaozadian (ZZD), Damaidian (DMD), and Shaochedian (SCD). Factors such as Distance to towns and Landcover predominantly influence breeding habitat selection. In the migration phase, ideal regions covered an expanse of 124 km2, highlighting areas like northern and eastern SCD, the northwestern side of Datian Village (DTV) and Beitian Village (BTV) Fuhe Wetland (FHW), and Xiaoyihe Wetland (XYHW). The predominant determinants for migration habitat are Distance to towns and Wetness. These insights offer a fundamental foundation for the conservation and management strategies of Baer\u2019s Pochard in BYD, presenting a roadmap for future conservation endeavors.",

      "abstract": "Dynamic path planning has gained increasing popularity in mobile robot navigation. Some of the current path planning methods require a priori information about the motion space and are easily affected by the distribution of obstacles. To address the above limitation, this paper presents a novel dynamic method that transforms path planning into an optimal control problem and solves it dynamically through adaptive dynamic programming and artificial potential field. The proposed method can obtain optimal paths for a differentially-driven mobile robot model in an unknown environment with many irregular obstacles. First, by combining path optimization and kinematical constraints of the mobile robot, the original problem is transformed into a new problem. Second, the total distance traveled, the effect of heading angle, the distance from the target to the robot, and the resultant force of the artificial potential field are included in the new performance index function. Third, the method based on adaptive dynamic programming is developed to avoid obstacles and guarantee the safety of autonomous navigation. The convergence analysis provides theoretical guarantees for our method, and the iterative control sequence will converge to the optimal control. Furthermore, simulation results and analyses under different complexity levels demonstrate that our method has promising performance in exploring and exploiting dynamic path planning problems. \u00c2\u00a9 2023 Elsevier Ltd",

In the sliding phase, an observer-based sliding mode surface and an equivalent control law are proposed to address the finite-time boundedness problem of the Markov jump unmanned surface vehicle systems. In the reaching phase, a chattering-free sliding mode controller is designed to ensure that the state trajectories of the Markov jump unmanned surface vehicle systems can be driven onto the sliding mode surface.

To further enhance the adapted model, the multilayer feature discriminators are established to realize the fine-grained alignment.

      "abstract": "Ensuring safety and achieving human-level driving performance remain challenges for autonomous vehicles, especially in safety-critical situations. As a key component of artificial intelligence, reinforcement learning is promising and has shown great potential in many complex tasks; however, its lack of safety guarantees limits its real-world applicability. Hence, further advancing reinforcement learning, especially from the safety perspective, is of great importance for autonomous driving. As revealed by cognitive neuroscientists, the amygdala of the brain can elicit defensive responses against threats or hazards, which is crucial for survival in and adaptation to risky environments. Drawing inspiration from this scientific discovery, we present a fear-neuro-inspired reinforcement learning framework to realize safe autonomous driving through modeling the amygdala functionality. This new technique facilitates an agent to learn defensive behaviors and achieve safe decision making with fewer safety violations. Through experimental tests, we show that the proposed approach enables the autonomous driving agent to attain state-of-the-art performance compared to the baseline agents and perform comparably to 30 certified human drivers, across various safety-critical scenarios. The results demonstrate the feasibility and effectiveness of our framework while also shedding light on the crucial role of simulating the amygdala function in the application of reinforcement learning to safety-critical autonomous driving domains. \u00c2\u00a9 2023 IEEE.",

Then, the decentralized unknown input observer (UIO)-based fault estimation and distributed secure control approach is developed in a co-designed framework for multi-USVs with cyber\u2013physical threats. Advantages of the proposed secure scheme are: 1) actuator faults, DoS attacks, and event-triggering strategies with varying action instants, durations, and locations are synchronously addressed and 2) the criteria of exponential consensus are derived by virtue of attack frequency and average dwelling time technique without prior knowledge of unknown wave-induced perturbation bounds and elimination of Zeno behavior in an event-based mechanism. Comparative simulations outline the performance and advantage of the proposed distributed secure control algorithm. IEEE",

      "abstract": "Purpose: Accurate and fast multiorgan segmentation is essential in image-based internal dosimetry in nuclear medicine. While conventional manual PET image segmentation is widely used, it suffers from both being time-consuming as well as subject to human error. This study exploited 2D and 3D deep learning (DL) models. Key organs in the trunk of the body were segmented and then used as a reference for networks. Methods: The pre-trained p2p-U-Net-GAN and HighRes3D architectures were fine-tuned with PET-only images as inputs. Additionally, the HighRes3D model was alternatively trained with PET/CT images. Evaluation metrics such as sensitivity (SEN), specificity (SPC), intersection over union (IoU), and Dice scores were considered to assess the performance of the networks. The impact of DL-assisted PET image segmentation methods was further assessed using the Monte Carlo (MC)-derived S-values to be used for internal dosimetry. Results: A fair comparison with manual low-dose CT-aided segmentation of the PET images was also conducted. Although both 2D and 3D models performed well, the HighRes3D offers superior performance with Dice scores higher than 0.90. Key evaluation metrics such as SEN, SPC, and IoU vary between 0.89\u00e2\u0080\u00930.93, 0.98\u00e2\u0080\u00930.99, and 0.87\u00e2\u0080\u00930.89 intervals, respectively, indicating the encouraging performance of the models. The percentage differences between the manual and DL segmentation methods in the calculated S-values varied between 0.1% and 6% with a maximum attributed to the stomach. Conclusion: The findings prove while the incorporation of anatomical information provided by the CT data offers superior performance in terms of Dice score, the performance of HighRes3D remains comparable without the extra CT channel. It is concluded that both proposed DL-based methods provide automated and fast segmentation of whole-body PET/CT images with promising evaluation metrics. Between them, the HighRes3D is more pronounced by providing better performance and can therefore be the method of choice for 18F-FDG-PET image segmentation. \u00c2\u00a9 2024 The Authors.

      "abstract": "Annatto, a globally valued crop, has multifaceted applications ranging from food coloring to medicine. While adaptable, its productivity is influenced by climate, making it vulnerable to global warming. This study investigates the agroclimatic suitability for annatto cultivation in Brazil, considering current and projected climate scenarios, highlighting potential impacts on agriculture, the economy, and environmental sustainability. This study aims to carry out the annatto (Bixa orellana L.) agroclimatic zoning for Brazil in the current scenario and the SSP5-8.5 climate change scenario for CMIP6. Air temperature and daily precipitation data for the 1970\u20132000 and for 2021\u20132100 for the IPSL-CM6A-LR model the SSP1-2.6, SSP2-4.5, SSP3-2.6 and SSP5-8.5 in GeoTIFF format. This study was carried out for the entire Brazilian territory. Future climate variables were obtained by the WorldClim 2.1 platform for the IPSL-CM6A-LR model in the periods 2021\u20132100 and the SSP1-2.6, SSP2-4.5, SSP3-2.6 and SSP5-8.5 scenario. Thus, zoning was carried out using geographic information systems software (QGIS), automated with the Python language. The annatto climate zoning for the current scenario showed five classes. The most predominant class was restricted due to excess water (42.9%), followed by the suitable class (32.5%), standing out the central Brazilian region: Mato Grosso do Sul (91.6%), Goi\u00e1s (80.8%), and Tocantins (92.6%). Climate change affected negatively annatto climate zoning in all scenarios. The suitability class for the SSP5-8.5 scenario decreased in all periods, with means of 27.9% (2021\u20132040), 20.2% (2041\u20132060), 12.1% (2061\u20132080), and 6.5% (2081\u20132100). Climate changes significantly impact annatto cultivation areas in Brazil, particularly by 2081\u20132100, with a notable reduction in suitable zones. Key producing regions, like Monte Castelo-SP and Dracena-SP, face unsuitability, threatening local economies. The study underscores the urgency to explore annatto's adaptive capacity against the direst IPCC scenario (SSP5-8.5).",

      "abstract": "Continuously increasing micro meteorite and orbital debris (MMOD) in space poses a threat to any manned or unmanned space vehicle with increasing probability of damaging object impact. To address the sufficient level of protection of space vessels, many Whipple shield configurations has been studied for over half a century. Bumper plate of Whipple shields studied in existing literature are flat surfaced plates. In contrast to earlier studies, this paper investigates the reaction of bumper plates with wavy surfaces against hypervelocity impact by analysing how they contribute to projectile fragmentation, formation of debris cloud, and how they dissipate the impact energy. Aluminium plates with four different surface wave profiles (WPs) were numerically investigated under hypervelocity impact conditions to assess their performance on disintegration of the impacting projectile. Fragmentation patterns of spherical aluminium projectile and debris cloud generated by projectile-wavy plate couples were examined and compared with the equivalents observed in flat-surfaced plate impact. A hybrid Smoothed Particle Hydrodynamics (SPH) combined with finite element modelling (FEM) approach was adopted using ANSYS software to simulate hypervelocity impact phenomenon at 3 km/s. Results of the numerical work carried out in this study revealed the distinctive debris cloud generation that has never been reported before in the existing literature. Furthermore, compared to the flat plate, wavy plates are found to be more effective in decreasing the impact energy. \u00c2\u00a9 2023 Elsevier Ltd",

      "abstract": "One of the threats to industrial unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), which require a high level of safety, is the degradation of control wireless communication performance due to electromagnetic interference. Self-jamming caused by unintentional electromagnetic (EM) noises from the multiple electronic devices installed in a UAV, such as the power supply and camera, is a fundamental issue independent of the surrounding environment. UAVs are susceptible to self-jamming since electronic devices as noise sources are densely mounted inside their chassis. Therefore, evaluating the self-jamming problem and taking countermeasures to achieve high safety in wireless communication performance are important. In this paper, we focus on mobile communications used for UAV operation and evaluate the impact of EM noise generated by a commercial industrial UAV on the receiver sensitivity of an onboard mobile communication device. It was found that EM noise generated by the UAV degrades the sensitivity in the three communication bands, 800 MHz, 1800 MHz, and 2100 MHz, used over the air. In particular, receiver sensitivity was degraded by up to 29 dB in the 800 MHz band, indicating that the self-jamming problem is not negligible for the safe operation of industrial UAVs. In addition, countermeasures for self-jamming were taken at the mechanical design level to suppress EM noise to a level that does not degrade mobile communication performance. The results of this study show that countermeasures for self-jamming are an important element for safe UAV operation. Authors",

      "abstract": "The automation of map labeling is an ongoing research challenge. Currently, the map labeling algorithms are based on rules defined by experts for optimizing the placement of the text labels on maps. In this paper, we investigate the feasibility of using well-labeled map samples as a source of knowledge for automating the labeling process. The basic idea is to train deep learning models, specifically the generative models CycleGAN and Pix2Pix, on a large number of map examples. Then, the trained models are used to predict good locations of the labels given unlabeled raster maps. We compare the results obtained by the deep learning models to manual map labeling and a state-of-the-art optimization-based labeling method. A quantitative evaluation is performed in terms of legibility, association and map readability as well as a visual evaluation performed by three professional cartographers. The evaluation indicates that the deep learning models are capable of finding appropriate positions for the labels, but that they, in this implementation, are not well suited for selecting the labels to show and to determine the size of the labels. The result provides valuable insights into the current capabilities of generative models for such task, while also identifying the key challenges that will shape future research directions. \u00c2\u00a9 2023 The Author(s).

      "abstract": "Extensive research in the traction component of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV) reveals that selection of electric motor is paramount to enhance its endurance flight time with high efficiency. This can be achieved by employing a motor with light weight, low losses, high efficiency and efficient speed\u2014torque characteristics. For addressing the above-mentioned requirements, an outer-rotor-permanent-magnet-synchronous-motor with inner-periphery-inset-magnet (OR-PMSM-IPIM) structure is selected, as it has eminent electromagnetic performance. To optimize structural design of such geometries, it is important to utilize the better exploration and exploitation of search space of design parameters. Hence, inspired by the high accuracy of optimization obtained by slime mold optimization (SMO) technique, a modified version of this algorithm is developed by introducing its collective behavior and swarm intelligence in the environment. In order to avoid collapsing for local optimal spots and enhance diversity in the population, the introduction of complex group interaction patterns is carried out in the traditional SMO algorithm. In order to verify the effectiveness and convergence speed of proposed methodology, few comparative experiments are administered using Benchmark functions. Through experiments using different integrated collective behaviors (CBs) to SMO, it is found that nearly 10% lesser values are obtained for unimodal and multimodal functions. Also, the convergence profiles are improved by the proposed novel CB-SMO algorithm, when compared to existing SMO technique. The application of proposed method is tested by developing design optimization problem (DOP) for OR-PMSM-IPIM. The analysis results show that the torque-per-unit-weight performance of optimized model of OR-PMSM-IPIM has been increased by 6% through proposed CB-SMO design optimization.",

      "abstract": "This paper studies the constrained distributed resource allocation problems (DRAPs) of autonomous multi-agent systems (MASs). Unlike well-defined DRAPs, the disturbed second-order agents are taken into account. Moreover, all agents' decisions are subject to both coupling and local inequalities. Because of the coexistence of disturbed second-order nonlinear dynamics and inequality constraints, existing strategies are not applicable to tackle our problem. Also, they create challenges for the strategy design, because the inequality constraints must hold at the optimal allocation (OA), while these agents are not able to control their decisions directly. By gradient descent, state feedback and internal model (IM), we exploit a distributed strategy to control all agents to carry out the distributed resource allocation tasks (DRATs). Furthermore, the strategy is rigorously analyzed. Finally, our strategy is applied to the economic dispatch problems (EDPs). Under our approach, turbine-generators can autonomously achieve the optimal generation allocation by regulating their powers, in accordance with the load demand of smart grids. \u00c2\u00a9 2023 Elsevier Inc.",

      "abstract": "Advanced Driver Assistance Systems (ADAS) are advanced technologies that assist drivers with vehicle operation and navigation. Recent improvements and brisk expansion in the ADAS market, as well as an increase in the frequency of incidents such as sensor spoofing, communication interruption etc., in autonomous vehicles (AVs), have raised the need to research ADAS security technology. The security issues raised by incorporating these technologies into automobiles must be addressed to protect the privacy and safety of passengers and other road users. As a result, the purpose of this research is to investigate the security issues that arise from the integration of ADAS technologies. Addressing these challenges holds the potential to establish a foundation for enhanced safety and dependability within transportation networks amidst the ongoing advancements in vehicle technology. This paper starts by describing the vulnerabilities, threats, assaults, and defense mechanisms of the ADAS. It then delves into the attacks and countermeasures in three categories, namely VANET, Hardware, and Adversarial attacks. VANET attacks encompass threats targeting Vehicular Ad Hoc Networks, aiming to disrupt communication among vehicles or between vehicles and infrastructure. Hardware attacks focus on vulnerabilities within the physical components of ADAS, including sensors, processors, or communication modules. Adversarial attacks involve deliberate manipulations or perturbations introduced into machine learning models or algorithms utilized within ADAS. These attacks aim to deceive or undermine the functionality of AI-based systems, causing misclassification, compromising system integrity, and posing risks to user safety by exploiting vulnerabilities in the AI decision-making process. Finally, this study highlights potential areas for future research, such as the utilization of artificial intelligence (AI), the necessity of industry-wide standardization, and recommends specific future work tailored to each attack described in the corresponding sections. \u00c2\u00a9 2023 The Authors.",

      "abstract": "Multi-agent systems (MAS) have gained increasing research attention in recent years due to their wide applications in cooperative control of autonomous vehicles, sensor networks, robotics, etc. However, designing effective distributed control strategies for MAS with complex dynamics remains challenging. This paper proposes an improved differential evolution (DE) based cooperative control strategy to stabilize and synchronize MAS with uncertain nonlinear dynamics. Specifically, we develop a new mutation strategy inspired by opposition-based learning to enhance the exploration ability and adopt an adaptive parameter mechanism to balance exploration and exploitation. Moreover, a distributed sliding mode term is incorporated in the control input to counteract uncertainties and external disturbances. Rigorous stability analysis shows that the closed-loop MAS can achieve synchronization under the proposed control strategy. Extensive simulations demonstrate that compared to other state-of-the-art DE algorithms and cooperative control methods, the proposed strategy achieves lower synchronization error, control cost, higher convergence speed, and higher accuracy for MAS with different scales, dynamics, and uncertainties. \u00c2\u00a9 2023 Elsevier B.V.",

      "abstract": "A receiver architecture for cognitive sensing and navigation with orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM)-based systems is proposed. The proposed receiver enables exploiting all the transmitted periodic beacons of 5G new radio (NR) and Starlink low Earth orbit (LEO) signals to draw navigation observables. Reference signals (RSs) of modern OFDM-based systems, such as 5G NR, contain both always-on and on-demand components. These components can be unknown or known but subject to change. To leverage all transmitted signals for navigation purposes, the RS signals should be detected and tracked cognitively. Similar to conventional navigation receivers, the proposed architecture involves acquisition and tracking stages. However, both stages are supplemented by the unorthodox capability of estimating and updating the RS signals. The acquisition stage instructs the tracking stage by reporting performance metrics, which are used to adjust the tracking loop gains to update the RS accordingly. A chirp model is considered to capture the high dynamics of Doppler frequency in intensive Doppler scenarios, where the navigating vehicle is maneuvering or the transmitting source is not static. The effect of Doppler rate estimation error on frame length estimation is analyzed. Experimental results are presented demonstrating the performance of the proposed receiver by: (i) enabling an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) to detect and exploit terrestrial 5G NR cellular signals in a blind fashion for navigation purposes, achieving a two-dimensional (2D) root-mean squared error (RMSE) of 4.2 m over a total trajectory of 416 m; (ii) enabling a ground vehicle that traversed a trajectory of 1.79 km to cognitively sense an unknown gNB (blindly detect, track, and exploit transmitted always-on and on-demand signals), localizing it with a 2D error of 5.83 m; and (iii) tracking Starlink LEO OFDM signals, producing Doppler measurements, which were fused to localize a stationary receiver with a 2D error of 6.5 m, starting from an initial estimate 179 km away from the receiver's true position. \u00c2\u00a9 1983-2012 IEEE.",

      "abstract": "The spotlight of our discussion here is on developing a model for detecting snakes present in the agricultural fields using cameras and machine learning algorithms. The idea is to construct a machine learning model to identify the snakes, which will be trained on a vast set of images of snakes. These images will be carefully selected to include the snake patterns, skin color of different species of snakes (extraction of the unique features). This is done to train the model properly to identify different types of snakes that the farmer encounters in the fields. Most famers are unaware and have a need for a way to detect these snakes so that they can either avoid them or get rid of them. Hence, this system can be implemented to prevent thousands of deaths and can help famers alleviate the repercussions of snake bites. Mistakes in recognizing potentially harmful animal species based only on visual cues are major contributors to the high death toll from venomous animal attacks. Since they spend so much time in the fields, where rice and wheat are cultivated, farmers are at a higher risk of being bitten by a snake than the general population. Because of their ignorance, illiterate farmers are more inclined to believe in superstitions, which can lead to their untimely deaths from snakebites despite medical intervention. Animals that would normally pose no threat to humans are responsible for the deaths of thousands of people every year because of environmental factors. However, because it is hard for humans to recognize these dangers, a new design paradigm has been developed to make it simpler. Researchers in the field of animal biology can use it to search for endangered species. Predators may enter gardens and green areas like tea and coffee plantations. There is not yet a plan in place to implement automated sorting for discovering distinctions. By applying the suggested framework to photographs of potentially dangerous animals, several factors useful for studying animal organization may be easily identified. For the classifier to run in real-time, it is suggested that YOLO be utilized for double processing within the framework. Furthermore, the YOLO technique enables quick animal recognition in a similar fashion. First, the YOLO method will be used to determine whether a snake is present in the proposed work. Here, 87 percent precision is also reached in the detection of snakes.",

      "abstract": "There is a definite possibility that, in a recent future, Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) will form the backbone of any smart city in terms of automation and networking. One approach to extend the UAVs' resources spectrum is to provide a mean for them to opportunistically recharge and connect to otherwise unreachable networks: provide Training and Recharge Areas (TRAs). In these dedicated areas, the UAVs could dock to Energy and Data Dispensers (EDD) devices to resupply their batteries and exploit a high-speed connection. To autonomously move through the smart city while accomplishing a set of given tasks but, at the same time, consider visiting the EDDs, is part of a tridimensional trajectory planning problem that needs to be addressed. In this paper, we formally define the combinatorial optimization problem representing the trajectory planning. We consider the case in which more than one UAV can be connected with the same EDD at the same time, by properly addressing the assignment of the bandwidth. Through simulative investigation, realistic values for the solution of the optimization problem are found. The behavior of the proposed model is compared with an 'online' approach that does not require the same resources and knowledge and whose evaluation and comparison with the 'offline' approach are performed through network simulation. \u00c2\u00a9 2002-2012 IEEE.",

      "abstract": "Along with the ubiquity of various Internet of things (IoT) applications, data collection in harsh environments with the help of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) and unmanned surface vehicles (USVs) appears as a popular approach. However, from a networking and transmission perspective, how unmanned vehicles collaborate with each other and with end IoT devices as well as the propagation characteristics for such data transmissions are less exploited. In this paper, we develop a long-range wide-area network (LoRaWAN)-based data collection framework which enables UAV and/or USV assisted data acquisition in harsh environments. Within this framework, end devices are placed in hard-to-reach locations and data acquisition is performed in an on-demand manner by unmanned vehicles acting as a gateway or peer for end devices. The framework also includes a step-by-step procedure for data collection and analytics, from parameter configuration to model validation. To reveal the transmission characteristics, we identify three scenarios in a mountainous region in Romania and perform extensive real-life measurements for data collection. Based on the collected datasets, we develop four propagation models and demonstrate that our empirical models outperform the theoretical reference models. Based on the developed empirical models, the coverage of LoRaWAN for any spreading factor can be estimated with high precision. IEEE",

      "abstract": "Background: There are conflicting data on the effect of cardiac resynchronization therapy with a defibrillator (CRT-D) on the risk of life-threatening ventricular tachyarrhythmia in heart failure patients. Objectives: The authors aimed to assess whether QRS morphology is associated with risk of ventricular arrhythmias in CRT recipients. Methods: The study population comprised 2,862 patients implanted with implantable cardioverter defibrillator (ICD)/CRT-D for primary prevention who were enrolled in 5 landmark primary prevention ICD trials (MADIT-II [Multicenter Automated Defibrillator Implantation Trial], MADIT-CRT [Multicenter Automated Defibrillator Implantation Trial-Cardiac Resynchronization Therapy], MADIT-RIT [Multicenter Automated Defibrillator Implantation Trial-Reduction in Inappropriate Therapy], MADIT-RISK [Multicenter Automated Defibrillator Implantation Trial-RISK], and RAID [Ranolazine in High-Risk Patients With Implanted Cardioverter Defibrillators]). Patients with QRS duration \u00e2\u0089\u00a5130 ms were divided into 2 groups: those implanted with an ICD only vs CRT-D. The primary endpoint was fast ventricular tachycardia (VT)/ventricular fibrillation (VF) (defined as VT \u00e2\u0089\u00a5200 beats/min or VF), accounting for the competing risk of death. Secondary endpoints included appropriate shocks, any sustained VT or VF, and the burden of fast VT/VF, assessed in a recurrent event analysis. Results: Among patients with left bundle branch block (n = 1,792), those with CRT-D (n = 1,112) experienced a significant 44% (P < 0.001) reduction in the risk of fast VT/VF compared with ICD-only patients (n = 680), a significantly lower burden of fast VT/VF (HR: 0.55; P = 0.001), with a reduced burden of appropriate shocks (HR: 0.44; P < 0.001). In contrast, among patients with non-left bundle branch block (NLBBB) (N = 1,070), CRT-D was not associated with reduction in fast VT/VF (HR: 1.33; P = 0.195). Furthermore, NLBBB patients with CRT-D experienced a statistically significant increase in the burden of fast VT/VF events compared with ICD-only patients (HR: 1.90; P = 0.013). Conclusions: Our data suggest a potential proarrhythmic effect of CRT among patients with NLBBB. These data should be considered in patient selection for treatment with CRT. \u00c2\u00a9 2024 American College of Cardiology Foundation",

      "abstract": "People with special needs can receive health care services in their own homes through the use of smart home systems. In essence, this type of smart home has specialized electronics that allow remote operation of automated remote health care gadgets, enabling patient security and health tracking. These sensors are linked to a local intelligence unit, which examines sensor data, detects emergencies, and serves as the patient\u2019s point of contact with various healthcare professionals such as doctors, paramedics, nurses, and emergency services. Smart homes can improve the patient\u2019s quality of life and security by creatively utilizing cutting-edge technologies. The use of smart homes is being driven by telemedicine and telecare. Telecare Medicine Information Systems (TMIS) were developed 20&nbsp;years ago and have increased in popularity on a global scale since then as current technology has enabled healthcare to be delivered remotely. Using upgraded network technologies, a new technological platform for TMIS for patients is provided. TMIS, on the other hand, is commonly targeted by various forms of attacks due to data transmission across an insecure channel. Several authentication techniques based on the chaotic map have recently been proposed. Many of these designs, however, are not resistant to the known attacks. Although some of the structures achieve low computation overhead, many of them are unable to guarantee forward secrecy and cannot establish an anonymous conversation. In order to improve security and efficiency, we provide an authentication and key agreement mechanism for TMIS in smart city environments in this study. Fractional chaotic theory assumptions underlie the security assumptions. With just two messages exchanged, a secure session can be started using this approach, which enables forward secrecy. In addition, we compare and contrast related authentication techniques.",

      "abstract": "Efficient data processing and computation are essential for the Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) to empower various applications, which can be significantly bottlenecked by the limited energy capacity and computation capability of the IIoT nodes. In this article, we employ an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) as an edge server to assist IIoT data processing, while considering the practical issue of UAV jittering. Specifically, we propose a joint design on trajectory and offloading strategies to minimize energy consumption due to local and edge computation, as well as data transmission. We particularly address UAV jittering that induces Gaussian-distributed uncertainties associated with flying waypoints, resulting in probabilistic-form flying speed and data offloading constraints. We exploit the Bernstein-type inequality to reformulate the constraints in deterministic forms and decompose the energy minimization to solve for trajectory and offloading separately within an alternating optimization framework. The subproblems are then tackled with the successive convex approximation technique. Simulation results show that our proposal strictly guarantees robustness under uncertainties and effectively reduces energy consumption as compared with the baselines. \u00c2\u00a9 2005-2012 IEEE.",

      "abstract": "Localizing targets outside the anchors' convex hull is an understudied but prevalent scenario in vehicle-centric, UAV-based, and self-localization applications. Considering such scenarios, this paper studies the optimal anchor placement problem for Time-of-Arrival (ToA)-based localization schemes such that the <italic>worst-case Dilution of Precision (DOP)</italic> is minimized. Building on prior results on DOP scaling laws for beyond convex hull ToA-based localization, we propose a novel metric termed the <italic>Range-Normalized DOP (RNDOP)</italic>. We show that the worst-case DOP-optimal anchor placement problem simplifies to a min-max RNDOP-optimal anchor placement problem. Unfortunately, this formulation results in a non-convex and intractable problem under realistic constraints. To overcome this, we propose iterative anchor addition schemes, which result in a tractable albeit non-convex problem. By exploiting the structure arising from the resultant rank-1 update, we devise three heuristic schemes with varying performance-complexity tradeoffs. In addition, we also derive the upper and lower bounds for scenarios where we are placing anchors to optimize the worst-case (a) 3D positioning error and (b) 2D positioning error. We build on these results to design a cohesive iterative algorithmic framework for robust anchor placement, characterize the impact of anchor position uncertainty, and then discuss the computational complexity of the proposed schemes. Using numerical results, we validate the accuracy of our theoretical results. We also present comprehensive Monte-Carlo simulation results to compare the positioning error and execution time performance of each iterative scheme, discuss the tradeoffs, and provide valuable system design insights for beyond convex hull localization scenarios.

      "abstract": "Wildfires present a significant threat to ecosystems and human life, requiring effective prevention and response strategies. Equally important is the study of post-fire damages, specifically burnt areas, which can provide valuable insights. This research focuses on the detection and classification of burnt areas and their severity using RGB and multispectral aerial imagery captured by an unmanned aerial vehicle. Datasets containing features computed from multispectral and/or RGB imagery were generated and used to train and optimize support vector machine (SVM) and random forest (RF) models. Hyperparameter tuning was performed to identify the best parameters for a pixel-based classification. The findings demonstrate the superiority of multispectral data for burnt area and burn severity classification with both RF and SVM models. While the RF model achieved a 95.5% overall accuracy for the burnt area classification using RGB data, the RGB models encountered challenges in distinguishing between mildly and severely burnt classes in the burn severity classification. However, the RF model incorporating mixed data (RGB and multispectral) achieved the highest accuracy of 96.59%. The outcomes of this study contribute to the understanding and practical implementation of machine learning techniques for assessing and managing burnt areas.",

      "abstract": "This article addresses indoor environment mapping by employing the synthetic aperture radar (SAR) technique at millimeter wave (mmWave) frequencies. The mmWave-based SAR can provide a high-resolution map, for example, of an emergency scenario like a burning room. The high-resolution map drives a new era of SAR applications such as object detection, classification, characterization, and precise localization. A major requirement at high frequencies is the precise knowledge of SAR trajectory, where radar sensors are mounted on a mobile platform such as a drone or unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV). State-of-the-art localization methods such as global positioning system (GPS)-aided inertial measurement units (IMUs) are not valid due to limited coverage and accuracy. One of the primary solutions could be the SAR assisted with an indoor localization system, which is exploited in the work. The presented indoor localization system comprises two types of passive chipless frequency-coded tags, based on dielectric resonators (DRs) and frequency-selective surfaces. In this work, first, the proposed method of integrating SAR and localization systems is evaluated in a single-tag environment. Further, a version of a room equipped with a multitag system is considered for real-time applications, and a successful demonstration of indoor environment mapping for the frequency spectrum of 75-110 GHz is presented. \u00c2\u00a9 2001-2012 IEEE.",

      "abstract": "In recent years, the industry and research have cast great attention to the Internet of Drones (IoD), which is becoming progressively popular since it can bring a great convenience to various application scenarios, such as national map exploration, public safety monitoring and automated military applications. In these scenarios, Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) (called drones) will be used to collect private information. Due to the fact that the private information are very sensitive, and drones working in public places easily suffer from physical capture or tampering attacks, the primary concern is that this information could be collected by adversaries or unauthorized users. In addition, as resource-constrained devices, drones are mostly equipped with small memory and have limited computing power. Therefore, how to ensure robust security as much as possible while achieving lightweight computing and communication costs has become an urgent problem to be solved in this field. In this paper, we propose A PUF-based Robust and Lightweight Authentication Protocol for Drone-Gateway and Drone-Drone Communication (PRLAP-IoD) to address these issues. Both formal security validation using conventional tools (ROR Model and AVISPA) and other informal security analysis clearly demonstrate that PRLAP-IoD can not only provide physical security, but also defend against a variety of known attacks. Finally, compared with the recent Authentication and Key Agreement (AKA) schemes, PRLAP-IoD can attain a delicate balance between computation cost and communication cost in IoD environment. \u00c2\u00a9 2023 Elsevier B.V.",

Consequently, the typical methodology for composite air\u2013ground risk avoidance in construction scenarios holds enormous importance. In this paper, an integrated potential-field-based risk assessment approach is proposed to evaluate the threat severity of the environmental obstacles. Meanwhile, the self-adaptive dynamic window approach is suggested to manage the real-time motion planning solution for air\u2013ground risks. By designing the multi-objective velocity sample window, we constrain the vehicle\u2019s speed planning instructions within reasonable limits. Combined with a hierarchical decision-making mechanism, this approach achieves effective obstacle avoidance with multiple drive modes. Simulation results demonstrate that, in comparison with the traditional dynamic window approach, the proposed method offers enhanced stability and efficiency in risk avoidance, underlining its notable safety and effectiveness.",

      "abstract": "Industrial robots are becoming increasingly vulnerable to cyber incidents and attacks, particularly with the dawn of the Industrial Internet-of-Things (IIoT). To gain a comprehensive understanding of these cyber risks, vulnerabilities of industrial robots were analyzed empirically, using more than three million communication packets collected with testbeds of two ABB IRB120 robots and five other robots from various Original Equipment Manufacturers (OEMs). This analysis, guided by the confidentiality\u00e2\u0080\u0093integrity\u00e2\u0080\u0093availability (CIA) triad, uncovers robot vulnerabilities in three dimensions: confidentiality, integrity, and availability. These vulnerabilities were used to design Covering Robot Manipulation via Data Deception (CORMAND2), an automated cyber\u00e2\u0080\u0093physical attack against industrial robots. CORMAND2 manipulates robot operation while deceiving the Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition (SCADA) system that the robot is operating normally by modifying the robot's movement data and data deception. CORMAND2 and its capability of degrading the manufacturing was validated experimentally using the aforementioned seven robots from six different OEMs. CORMAND2 unveils the limitations of existing anomaly detection systems, more specifically the assumption of the authenticity of SCADA-received movement data, to which we propose mitigations for. \u00c2\u00a9 2023",

      "abstract": "Accurate robot kinematic modelling is a major component for autonomous robot control to guarantee safety and precision during task execution. In surgical robotics complex robotic structures and actuation mechanisms are generally employed, therefore machine learning techniques can be adopted to build the model of the robot. Probabilistic neural networks are a class of learning approaches that provide information about the uncertainty of the learnt models. In this work we compare two different probabilistic neural networks (Bayesian and Evidential Neural Networks) to model the kinematics of a surgical robotic instrument and propose a control strategy based on Hierarchical Quadratic Programming (HQP) capable of exploiting the model uncertainty to improve the accuracy and safety of the controller. Simulation and real world experiments on different autonomous path tracking tasks show that the model uncertainty highly affects the control performances and prove the effectiveness of the proposed controller in improving task execution. Note to Practitioners - The push towards reducing invasiveness and patient's traumas in surgery has lead to the requirement of miniaturized and highly articulated robots. This however comes at the cost of having systems that are hard to model and control, which is one of the major limitations for autonomy in surgical robotics. Machine learning has become very effective in modelling complex systems and probabilistic approaches additionally allow estimating the confidence of the learnt model. In robotics field where high precision is required to perform an autonomous task, like in minimally invasive surgery, the robot model needs to be very accurate and controllers need to guarantee safety in performing the desired task, while satisfying additional motion constraints imposed by the application scenario. This work proposes the use of probabilistic neural networks to model the complexity of a surgical robotic instrument and a control strategy capable of ensuring safety by maximizing model's confidence and guaranteeing satisfaction of imposed motion constraints. In this work a macro-micro manipulator setup is employed, consisting of an articulated surgical robotic instrument connected to a serial-link manipulator. The proposed modelling and control approaches can be used in any other field where controllers need to highly rely on the robot model due to limitations in using external sensors and where leveraging information about model's confidence can be beneficial. Currently, the work focuses only on pure kinematic modelling and control, thus neglecting any possible interaction with the environment. Future work will focus on addressing this limitation in order to ensure proper force control and effective autonomy. \u00c2\u00a9 2004-2012 IEEE.",

      "abstract": "Camouflaged people are extremely expert in actively concealing themselves by effectively utilizing cover and the surrounding environment. Despite advancements in optical detection capabilities through imaging systems, including spectral, polarization, and infrared technologies, there is still a lack of effective real-time method for accurately detecting small-size and high-efficient camouflaged people in complex real-world scenes. Here, this study proposes a snapshot multispectral image-based camouflaged detection model, multispectral YOLO (MS-YOLO), which utilizes the SPD-Conv and SimAM modules to effectively represent targets and suppress background interference by exploiting the spatial-spectral target information. Besides, the study constructs the first real-shot multispectral camouflaged people dataset (MSCPD), which encompasses diverse scenes, target scales, and attitudes. To minimize information redundancy, MS-YOLO selects an optimal subset of 12 bands with strong feature representation and minimal inter-band correlation as input. Through experiments on the MSCPD, MS-YOLO achieves a mean Average Precision of 94.31% and real-time detection at 65 frames per second, which confirms the effectiveness and efficiency of our method in detecting camouflaged people in various typical desert and forest scenes. Our approach offers valuable support to improve the perception capabilities of unmanned aerial vehicles in detecting enemy forces and rescuing personnel in battlefield. \u00c2\u00a9 2023 China Ordnance Society",

      "abstract": "This paper investigates a reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS)-assisted unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV)-enabled wireless powered communication network (WPCN). In the system, a UAV acts as a hybrid access point (HAP) to charge users in the downlink (DL) and receive messages in the uplink (UL). In particular, the RIS is exploited to significantly enhance the efficiency of both the DL and UL transmission. Our objective is to enhance the minimum throughput among all ground users by jointly optimizing the horizontal location of UAVs, the transmit power of users, transmission time allocation, and passive beamforming vectors at the RIS. To address this problem, we present an alternating optimization-based algorithm with low complexity to decompose the problem into four subproblems and solve them sequentially. In particular, we derive a lower bound of the composite channel gain to tighten the constraints and employ successive convex approximation (SCA) to optimize the horizontal location of the UAV. The transmit power closed-form optimum solutions are then obtained, and the problem of time allocation is reformulated as a linear programming problem. Finally, we optimize the passive beamforming vectors by adopting semi-definite relaxation (SDR). The effectiveness of the algorithm is supported by numerical results, which also demonstrate that the RIS-assisted UAV-enabled WPCN outperforms the traditional WPCN in terms of the minimum throughput.

      "abstract": "This article addresses an autonomous manipulation problem for an underwater vehicle-manipulator system (UVMS) operating in a free-floating way while subjecting to unknown continuous disturbance. More specifically, a composite control scheme composed of disturbance observer (DOB), predictor model network (PM-Net), and nonlinear model predictive control (NMPC), is devised to improve the control performance of UVMS (i.e., unicycle-like UVMS actuated only in the surge, heave, and yaw for vehicle body) in the case of disturbance, model mismatch, and input saturation. A RBF-DOB is formulated by combining a DOB and a Radial Basis Function (RBF) neural network to estimate disturbance at the current step. Then, the PM-Network, composed of a disturbance predictor network and state predictor network, is developed based on long short-term memory (LSTM) network that predicts UVMS state sequences considering model mismatch and disturbance. The NMPC is deployed as a feedback control law to endow the input saturation of the UVMS and produce optimal control action. Compared with conventional DOB control methods using feed-forward compensation of disturbance, the primary merit of the proposed approach is that the disturbance estimated by RBF-DOB is utilized in the PM-Net to predict future UVMS state sequences, which are exploited on the NMPC's receding optimization. Finally, realistic simulation and relevant experiment are conducted to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method. Note to Practitioners - The motivation behind this article is the autonomous manipulation of an underwater vehicle-manipulator system subjected to unknown disturbance. However, it is not always feasible or straightforward to obtain the external disturbance and unmodeled dynamics for designing robust controllers. On the one hand, how to manipulate the disturbance into the designed controller to generate optimal control action rather than by using feed-forward compensation. On the other hand, the control input saturation often occurs in the UVMS control, especially under the disturbance rejection conditions, where it should be considered in the controller design. Currently, the predominant methods for UVMS control lack a control scheme that provides a complete and credible control strategy that takes the aforementioned issues into consideration. Motivated by the above analysis, this study provides a composite control scheme to deal with the dynamic uncertainties, unknown disturbance, and input saturation. The results of realistic simulation and relevant experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method. Hopefully, our control method can provide valuable theoretical and technical guidance to practicing marine engineers for controller design. \u00c2\u00a9 2004-2012 IEEE.",

There is a lack of research on the nonlinear vibration of the tethered UAV in a transient wind field environment. This study analyzes the vibration response of a tethered quadrotor UAV under a transient wind field, which helps to boost the tethered UAV applications, providing engineering suggestions to design these systems. Considering both cable and UAV motions, the coupled dynamic equations of the tethered UAV system are established based on the Hamilton principle. The variation law of the cable vibration amplitudes with wind field and position is analyzed through a one-minus-cosine gust profile to describe the transient wind field, which can evaluate the dynamic behavior of systems in the actual flight. Moreover, the positions of maximum vibration amplitude in tangential and normal directions are found to be approximately 9/10 and 9/20 from the lower end of the cable. Furthermore, the tethered UAV system vibrations are investigated under different structural parameters. The results indicate that the UAV can maintain a stable single-period motion by increasing the length or elastic modulus or selecting the appropriate diameters of the cable. Finally, an experiment is implemented on the vibration response of the tethered UAV system in a wind tunnel. The theoretical result is compatible with the experimental one, demonstrating the theoretical method&#x2019;s accuracy.",

The reinforcement learning algorithm which is designed based on neural networks is introduced to achieve intelligent optimal control. Under the actor-critic-identifier frame, three kinds of neural networks are used to realize the control action, evaluate the system performance, and estimate the unknown dynamic, respectively. Then, an improved event-triggered strategy including a decreasing function of the consensus error is designed to reduce the waste of resources while decreasing the adverse impact on tracking control performance as far as possible, which also does not exhibit Zeno behavior. Furthermore, an adaptive compensation control scheme is given, which can effectively compensate for the negative impacts brought by the false data injection attacks existing in information interaction among UAVs. Despite the impact of lumped disturbances and false data injection attacks, the proposed disturbance-observer-based distributed intelligent learning control strategy can still guarantee that all signals in the closed-loop unmanned aerial vehicle systems are bounded, and all follower unmanned aerial vehicles can track the signal of the leader unmanned aerial vehicle. Finally, some simulation verification diagrams are shown to test the feasibility of the designed control strategy. IEEE",

      "abstract": "Deep learning networks, emerging machine learning models that present beyond human-level performance in terms of accuracy, are critically vulnerable to adversarial attacks. This vulnerability limits the utilization of deep learning architecture in many real-world safety-critical applications such as autonomous vehicles, medical diagnosis, sensitive industrial systems, etc. Adversarial attacks are methods to measure the robustness of different architectures and can be used to evaluate the suitability of a model to be used in a safety-critical situation. White-box sparse adversarial attacks can unhide interesting features of deep learning networks by identifying critical elements in the input pattern to design black-box attacks. This motivated us to design a new algorithmic procedure to design sparse adversarial attacks to feed-forward neural networks based on sparsity regularization. The proposed method comes with the gradual sparsification which starts by designing a dense attack and prone it until a desired level of sparsity is attained. We evaluate the performance of the proposed algorithm in designing attacks on convolutional neural networks and attention-based architectures for image classification task using three non-smooth sparsity-promoting regularizers. Compared to the state-of-the-art sparse attack schemes, we show that the proposed method can significantly decrease the time needed to design the attack, while the perturbation distortion is unchanged or reduced in some cases. \u00c2\u00a9 2023 Elsevier Ltd",

      "abstract": "A novel technique for effervescent-based dispersive liquid\u00e2\u0080\u0093liquid microextraction is reported. Rapid and continuous effervescence, driven by hydrogen bubbles, was utilized to transfer the analyte from the aqueous to the organic phase. The reactivity of magnesium metal with water was exploited to generate a stream of hydrogen bubbles. In this method, an aqueous sample solution, contained in a microcentrifuge tube, was treated with 1 mg of magnesium and 100 \u00c2\u00b5l of 1-undecanol. Microextraction was initiated by the addition of 100 \u00c2\u00b5l of 1 M sodium bicarbonate to induce a rapid stream of hydrogen bubbles. The microcentrifuge tube was cooled to allow the solidification of 1-undecanol which was carefully separated and analyzed. Factors potentially affecting extraction efficiency were optimized, including the magnesium mass, concentration of sodium bicarbonate, extraction time, pH, open/closed system, sample volume, temperature, and analyte concentrations. These studies revealed the required speed and minimum concentration of sodium bicarbonate, as well as the possibility of efficient microextraction without sodium bicarbonate but in acidic conditions or at elevated temperatures (45\u00e2\u0080\u009350 \u00c2\u00b0C). The analytical performance was assessed and demonstrated to be promising. In the case of the model drug quercetin, the limit of detection (LOD) was determined to be 0.051 \u00c2\u00b5g/ml, the limit of quantification (LOQ) was 0.154 \u00c2\u00b5g/ml, and the extraction efficiency was 100%. The applicability of this method was also evaluated on samples with variable physicochemical properties, demonstrating an automated, fast, and efficient liquid\u00e2\u0080\u0093liquid microextraction protocol. \u00c2\u00a9 2024 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",

      "abstract": "Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) are increasingly being deployed in crucial missions for the armed forces, law enforcement, industrial control monitoring, and other sectors. However, these hostile operating circumstances, along with the UAVs\u2019 dependence on wireless protocols, pose substantial security threats, limiting their mainstream application. With network security being such a major issue for UAV networks, the machine learning-based intrusion detection system (IDS) has been determined to be an effective strategy for protecting them. Additionally, though the existing methods offer effective strategies for detecting and categorizing abnormalities in the system, they are limited by their inability to adjust to various attack patterns. The dataset used as well as the memory and computational requirement of existing models, poses new challenges. One of the main concerns pertains to the reduced computational and memory demands of these models. So, the work carried out in this paper addresses this challenge. The work carried out in this paper addresses this challenge. A new dimensional reduction technique based on correlation coefficient, information gain, and principal component analysis (PCA) is introduced to reduce the dimensionality of the UAV Attack Dataset. A novel intrusion detection system based on an artificial neural network (ANN) and genetic algorithm (GA) is then proposed. The genetic algorithm is used to generate the optimal weights of the artificial neural network. A comparison is made between the proposed model and the backpropagation network and its variant in terms of its convergence and prediction accuracy. Furthermore, the performance of the proposed model is compared with that of other classifiers. This comparison reveals that the proposed model is time efficient with an increased prediction accuracy of at least 6% more than other classifiers. Authors",

      "abstract": "With the advances in smart vehicles and fog computing, Fog computing is extended to traditional Vehicular Ad Hoc Networks (VANETs). As a geographically distributed paradigm, Vehicle Fog Service (VFS) overcomes the limitations of VANETs in real-time response and location awareness. It supports a wide range of traffic information services, such as road warnings, congestion control, and autonomous driving. Secure communication between VFS entities is a critical problem in an open network. Meanwhile, most fog nodes are deployed in the public domain and are vulnerable to physical attacks. This paper proposes a secure authentication scheme for VFS to address the above issues. The scheme combines blockchain and physical unclonable function (PUF) to achieve two-way authentication of on-board units (OBU) and road side units (RSU) with the untrusted fog nodes. Our scheme provides conditional anonymity and non-repudiation, offering recourse in case of malicious behavior. Unlike other schemes, the proposed scheme only needs to determine whether the pseudo-identity has a revocation tag instead of scanning the whole certificate revocation list (CLS), significantly reducing the computational overhead. In addition, we use the Real-Or-Random ROR model and formally prove that the proposed scheme is provably secure, and informal security analysis shows that the scheme is robust to various known attacks. Finally, compared with existing schemes, our scheme maintains lower communication and computation costs and provides more security features, which shows that our scheme is more suitable for secure VFS environments.",

      "abstract": "Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) represent an essential component of advanced intelligent equipment that can be used as an aerial perception system by installing various sensors such as vision, hearing, touch, taste, and smell to achieve intelligently integrated perception of environments. However, these perception system with environmental information may be threatened by various internal and external attacks, causing a great challenge to the security of the UAV. The original security system relied on an expert knowledge base to prevent attacks, but the weaknesses of lacking proactivity and flexibility are gradually exposed. The strong resistance and survivability of biological systems can be used to fill this capability gap and provide new ideas for the security of the UAV perception system. Therefore, an endogenous security framework (ESUAV-NI) based on the neural system and immune system is proposed in this article. Through breeding artificial intelligence (AI) vaccines and distributed neural hierarchical control, we achieve the security protection for the UAV perception system. Moreover, we evaluated the AI vaccine breeding approach in the ESUAV-NI by conducting extensive experiments on internal threats and external aerial imagery camouflage data, respectively. The results show that the proposed approach has a superior performance for the UAV perception system. \u00c2\u00a9 2005-2012 IEEE.",

However, path energy consumption-based UUV hull design requires a tremendous amount of calculation due to the frequent changes in relative velocity and attack angle between a UUV and ocean current. In order to address this issue, this work developed a data-driven design methodology for energy consumption-based UUV hull design using artificial intelligence-aided design (AIAD). The design methodology in this work combined a deep learning (DL) algorithm that predicts UUVs' resistance with different hull shapes under different velocities and attack angles with the particle swarm optimization (PSO) algorithm for UUV hull design. We tested the proposed methodology in a path energy consumption-based experiment, where the optimized UUV hull showed an 8.8% reduction in path energy consumption compared with the initial UUV hull, and design costs were greatly reduced compared with the traditional computational fluid dynamics (CFD)-based methodology. Our work demonstrates that AIAD has the potential to solve UUV design problems previously thought to be too complex by offering a data-driven engineering shape (body surface) design method. \u00c2\u00a9 2023 by ASME.",

However, to enable effective mmWave communication within this dynamic network, it is essential to precisely align the steerable antennas mounted on Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) with their corresponding peer units. Therefore, it is important to design a novel approach that can quickly determine an optimized alignment and network topology. In this paper, we propose a Generative Adversarial Network (GAN)-based approach, called WaveGAN, for FANET topology optimization aiming to maximize the network throughput by selecting the communication paths with the best channel conditions. The proposed approach consists of a WaveGAN model followed by a beam search. The former learns how to generate optimized network topologies from a supervised dataset, while the latter adjusts the generated topologies to meet the structure requirements of the mmWave-based FANET. The simulation results show that the proposed approach is able to quickly find FANET topologies with a very small optimality gap for different network sizes.",

      "abstract": "Multi-agent trajectory prediction plays a pivotal role for intelligent transportation and autonomous driving. Modeling the social interaction among agents and revealing the inherent relationship between interaction and future trajectory are crucial for accurate trajectory prediction. To address these challenges, this letter proposes a goal-guided and interaction-aware state refinement graph attention network (SRGAT) for multi-agent trajectory prediction. Specifically, the trajectory sequence of individual agent is firstly converted into a compact representation by exploiting Transformer encoder and gated recurrent unit (GRU). Then, a social state refinement (SSR) module for modeling social influence between agents is proposed to include more interaction-related features. Subsequently, multiple goals are predicted for each agent, followed by another goal-guided SSR module to incorporate goal information into social interaction.

      "abstract": "Detecting spoofing attacks on the positions of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) within a swarm is challenging. Traditional methods relying solely on individually reported positions and pairwise distance measurements are ineffective in identifying the misbehavior of malicious UAVs. This paper presents a novel systematic structure designed to detect and mitigate spoofing attacks in UAV swarms. We formulate the problem of detecting malicious UAVs as a localization feasibility problem, leveraging the reported positions and distance measurements. To address this problem, we develop a semidefinite relaxation (SDR) approach, which reformulates the non-convex localization problem into a convex and tractable semidefinite program (SDP). Additionally, we propose two innovative algorithms that leverage the proximity of neighboring UAVs to identify malicious UAVs effectively. Simulations demonstrate the superior performance of our proposed approaches compared to existing benchmarks. Our methods exhibit robustness across various swarm networks, showcasing their effectiveness in detecting and mitigating spoofing attacks. Specifically, the detection success rate is improved by up to 65%, 55%, and 51% against distributed, collusion, and mixed attacks, respectively, compared to the benchmarks. \u00c2\u00a9 2005-2012 IEEE.",

      "abstract": "This paper reports on the use of co-simulation techniques to build prototypes of co-operative autonomous robotic cyber-physical systems. Designing such systems involves a mission-specific planner algorithm, a control algorithm to drive an agent performing its task; and the plant model to simulate the agent dynamics. An application aimed at positioning a swarm of unmanned aerial vehicles (drones) in a bounded area, exploiting a Voronoi tessellation algorithm developed in this work, is taken as a case study. The paper shows how co-simulation allows testing the complex system at the design phase using models created with different languages and tools. The paper then reports on how the adopted co-simulation platform enables control parameters calibration, by exploiting design space exploration technology. The INTO-CPS co-simulation platform, compliant with the Functional Mock-up Interface standard to exchange dynamic simulation models using various languages, was used in this work. The different software modules were written in Modelica, C, and Python. In particular, the latter was used to implement an original variant of the Voronoi algorithm to tesselate a convex polygonal region, by means of dummy points added at appropriate positions outside the bounding polygon. A key contribution of this case study is that it demonstrates how an accurate simulation of a cooperative drone swarm requires modeling the physical plant together with the high-level coordination algorithm. The coupling of co-simulation and design space exploration has been demonstrated to support control parameter calibration to optimize energy consumption and convergence time to the target positions of the drone swarm. From a practical point of view, this makes it possible to test the ability of the swarm to self-deploy in space in order to achieve optimal detection coverage and allow unmanned aerial vehicles in a swarm to coordinate with each other. \u00c2\u00a9 2023 The Authors.",

      "abstract": "This work focuses on the optimal trajectory of a rotary-wing unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) jammer and the system power allocation with the objective of maximizing the total secure energy efficiency (EE) of a slotted relay-assisted millimeter wave (mm-Wave) cognitive radio system. The UAV flies from starting location to final one in a round of communication mission that is overheard by a malicious eavesdropper. The network terminals are equipped with multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) antenna array. This work first develops a practical approximation propagation model by addressing three key challenges: path loss, small-scale Nakagami-m fading channel gains, and transceiver antenna beamforming gains. By using the approximate model, the upper and lower bounds of the ergodic rate of each communication link are derived. Second, with the objective of maximizing secure EE, the optimal UAV trajectory and system resource allocation framework is established by considering the constraints of interference at primary receiver (PR), information-causality relationship, rotary-wing UAV propulsion energy and so forth. The optimal framework is solved with a tractable CVX tool by using the derived upper and lower bounds and successive convex approximation. Finally, an iterative optimizing algorithm is established by using Dinkelbach's method. In the simulation, the work presents the comparison of UAV trajectories, secure rates, and secure EEs of three schemes, that is, the proposed EE scheme, the non-EE scheme where only the optimal secure rate is considered, and the EE scheme with the consideration of all communication-related energy consumption. The simulations show that the EE schemes achieve smoother UAV trajectory than non-EE, but the non-EE scheme has higher secure rate. The impact of communication energy consumption is negligible. In addition, the effect of MIMO antenna array and mm-Wave on system performance is exploited. \u00c2\u00a9 2023 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.",

      "abstract": "Shark-human interactions are some of the most pervasive human-wildlife conflicts, and their frequencies are increasing globally. New South Wales (Australia) was the first to implement a broad-scale program of shark-bite mitigation in 1937 using shark nets, which expanded in the late 2010s to include non-lethal measures. Using 196 unprovoked shark-human interactions recorded in New South Wales since 1900, we show that bites shifted from being predominantly on swimmers to 79 % on surfers by the 1980s and increased 2\u00e2\u0080\u00934-fold. We could not detect differences in the interaction rate at netted versus non-netted beaches since the 2000s, partly because of low incidence and high variance. Although shark-human interactions continued to occur at beaches with tagged-shark listening stations, there were no interactions while SMART drumlines and/or drones were deployed. Our effect-size analyses show that a small increase in the difference between mitigated and non-mitigated beaches could indicate reductions in shark-human interactions. Area-based protection alone is insufficient to reduce shark-human interactions, so we propose a new, globally transferable approach to minimise risk of shark bite more effectively. \u00c2\u00a9 2023 The Authors",

      "abstract": "This paper presents a novel detection and rerouting mechanism for distributed adaptive platoon control of non-linear autonomous connected vehicles under denial of service (DoS) attacks. DoS attacks can cause delays or losses of data packets due to blocked communication channels, leading to reducing platoon performance or even collisions among vehicles. To tackle this issue, the proposed mechanism detects and reroutes communication topology depending on the real-time topology and the number of link failures. Real-time detection divides the scenario of DoS attacks into three parts. According to the different scenarios, rerouting mechanisms will be utilized. A controller adapted to real-time variable communication topology is also designed in this scheme. The adjacency matrix of the real-time communication topology generated by the rerouting mechanism is used to update the controller so that the platoon can remain in a stable state without being affected by DoS attacks. In addition, the sliding mode controller and the observer are designed by solving linear matrix inequalities, and the platoon stability and internal stability are proven. Numerical simulation studies demonstrate that the proposed mechanism and control design can reduce the vehicle state estimate error and platoon-tracking error to ideal states under DoS attacks. The proposed method solves the problem that the existing methods have not considered the number of link failures and the inability to restore communication when the communication topology is paralyzed. \u00c2\u00a9 2024 The Authors.

      "abstract": "Aim: This study aimed to investigate trends over time in pre-hospital factors for pediatric out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (pOHCA) and long-term neurological and neuropsychological outcomes. These have not been described before in large populations. Methods: Non-traumatic arrest patients, 1 day-17 years old, presented to the Sophia Children's Hospital from January 2002 to December 2020, were eligible for inclusion. Favorable neurological outcome was defined as Pediatric Cerebral Performance Categories (PCPC) 1\u00e2\u0080\u00932 or no difference with pre-arrest baseline. The trend over time was tested with multivariable logistic and linear regression models with year of event as independent variable. Findings: Over a nineteen-year study period, the annual rate of long-term favorable neurological outcome, assessed at a median 2.5 years follow-up, increased significantly (OR 1.10, 95%-CI 1.03-1.19), adjusted for confounders. Concurrently, annual automated external defibrillator (AED) use and, among adolescents, initial shockable rhythm increased significantly (OR 1.21, 95% CI 1.10-1.33 and OR 1.15, 95% CI 1.02-1.29, respectively), adjusted for confounders. For generalizability purposes, only the total intelligence quotient (IQ) was considered for trend analysis of all tested domains. Total IQ scores and bystander basic life support (BLS) rate did not change significantly over time. Interpretation: Long-term favorable neurological outcome, assessed at a median 2.5 years follow-up, improved significantly over the study period. Total IQ scores did not significantly change over time. Furthermore, AED use (OR 1.21, 95%CI 1.10-1.33) and shockable rhythms among adolescents (OR1.15, 95%CI 1.02-1.29) increased over time. \u00c2\u00a9 2023 The Author(s)",

Several established threat analysis and risk assessment (TARA) methodologies are publicly available to address the evolving threat landscape. However, these methodologies inadequately capture the threat data of CCAVs, resulting in poorly defined threat boundaries or the reduced efficacy of the TARA. This is due to multiple factors, including complex hardware\u2013software interactions, rapid technological advancements, outdated security frameworks, heterogeneous standards and protocols, and human errors in CCAV systems. To address these factors, this study begins by systematically evaluating TARA methods and applying the Spoofing, Tampering, Repudiation, Information disclosure, Denial of service, and Elevation of privileges (STRIDE) threat model and Damage, Reproducibility, Exploitability, Affected Users, and Discoverability (DREAD) risk assessment to target system architectures. This study identifies vulnerabilities, quantifies risks, and methodically examines defined data processing components. In addition, this study offers an attack tree to delineate attack vectors and provides a novel defense taxonomy against identified risks. This article demonstrates the efficacy of the TARA in systematically capturing compromised security requirements, threats, limits, and associated risks with greater precision. By doing so, we further discuss the challenges in protecting hardware\u2013software assets against multi-staged attacks due to emerging vulnerabilities. As a result, this research informs advanced threat analyses and risk management strategies for enhanced security engineering of cyberphysical CCAV systems.",

      "abstract": "The integration of artificial intelligence (AI) in diagnosing diabetic retinopathy, a major contributor to global vision impairment, is becoming increasingly pronounced. Notably, the detection of vision-threatening diabetic retinopathy (VTDR) has been significantly fortified through automated techniques. Traditionally, the reliance on manual analysis of retinal images, albeit slow and error-prone, constituted the conventional approach. Addressing this, our study introduces a novel methodology that amplifies the robustness and precision of the detection process. This is complemented by the groundbreaking Hierarchical Block Attention (HBA) and HBA-U-Net architecture, which notably propel attention mechanisms in image segmentation. This innovative model refines image processing without imposing excessive computational demands by honing in on individual pixel intricacies, spatial relationships, and channel-specific attention. Building upon this innovation, our proposed method employs a multi-stage strategy encompassing data pre-processing, feature extraction via a hybrid CNN-SVD model, and classification employing an amalgamation of Improved Support Vector Machine-Radial Basis Function (ISVM-RBF), DT, and KNN techniques. Rigorously tested on the IDRiD dataset classified into five severity tiers, the hybrid model yields remarkable performance, achieving a 99.18% accuracy, 98.15% sensitivity, and 100% specificity in VTDR detection, thus surpassing existing methods. These results underscore a more potent avenue for diagnosing and addressing this crucial ocular condition while underscoring AI\u2019s transformative potential in medical care, particularly in ophthalmology.",

      "abstract": "X-ray imaging technologies find applications across various domains, including medical imaging in health institutions or security in military facilities and public institutions. X-ray images acquired from diverse sources necessitate analysis by either trained human experts or automated systems. In cases where concealed electronic cards potentially pose threats, such as in laptops harboring explosive triggering circuits, conventional analysis methods are challenging to detect, even when scrutinized by skilled. The present investigation is centered on the utilization of deep learning algorithms for the analysis of X-ray images of laptop computers, with the aim of identifying concealed hazardous components. To construct the dataset, some control cards such as Arduino, Raspberry Pi and Bluetooth circuits were hidden inside the 60 distinct laptop computers and were subjected to X-ray imaging, yielding a total of 5094 X-ray images. The primary objective of this study is to distinguish laptops based on the presence or absence of concealed electronic cards. To this end, a suite of deep learning models, including EfficientNet, DenseNet, DarkNet19, DarkNet53, Inception, MobileNet, ResNet18, ResNet50, ResNet101, ShuffleNet and Xception were subjected to training, testing, and comparative evaluation. The performance of these models was assessed utilizing a range of metrics, encompassing accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, precision, f-measure, and g-mean. Among the various models examined, the ShuffleNet model emerged as the top-performing one, yielding superior results in terms of accuracy (0.8355), sensitivity (0.8199), specificity (0.8530), precision (0.8490), f-measure (0.8322), and g-mean (0.8352). \u00c2\u00a9 2023 Elsevier B.V.",

      "abstract": "In the face of global biodiversity loss that threatens social\u00e2\u0080\u0093ecological sustainability, we must improve our knowledge of species' behaviours, life histories and populations. Enhanced understanding is especially critical for taxa like seabirds that live in remote habitats where monitoring is logistically challenging, and technology-based approaches could lead to major advances. Considering conservation threats and breeding behaviours, penguins represent a promising taxon for further exploration of monitoring methods. Only five of 18 penguin species are currently considered species of Least Concern by the IUCN, and the sensitivity of penguins to ecological disturbances makes them important indicators of ecosystem dynamics. Penguins regularly congregate in dense breeding colonies and are visually and aurally conspicuous animals, making them relatively easy to monitor in some respects. In situ observations and visual remote sensing monitoring methods (i.e. camera traps, uncrewed aerial vehicles and satellite imagery) currently provide highly valuable information on penguin behaviour and population dynamics, but these methods have a number of shortcomings. Several rely on human presence in remote areas, some require clean lines of sight with no visual obstructions, and some offer limited spatial and temporal resolution. In this study we explore the use of passive acoustic monitoring (PAM) as a complementary remote sensing method to monitor penguin behaviour and populations at high spatial and temporal resolution without visual constraints or the need for continuous human presence. We conducted observations of vocalization rates and placed automated acoustic recorders in colonies of Magellanic Penguins Spheniscus magellanicus and Southern Rockhopper Penguins Eudyptes chrysocome in conjunction with camera traps. We found positive relationships between acoustic activity and counts of Magellanic Penguins in camera trap photos. We also identified clear diel patterns of acoustic activity that differed between breeding stages, and we found positive correlations between acoustic activity and estimates of colony density for various times of day and radii around recorders. While much work remains to improve this method and refine interpretation, PAM holds great promise as a complementary tool for monitoring the relative abundance and behavioural dynamics of penguins and other colonial animals, particularly those that burrow or nest in dense vegetation that impairs visual monitoring techniques. \u00c2\u00a9 2023 British Ornithologists' Union.",

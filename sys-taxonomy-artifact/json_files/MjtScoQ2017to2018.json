      "abstract": "GNSS positioning with high Integrity and accuracy attributes is a key application for implementing more efficient and safer automated train systems. The goal is an overall system concept and train equipment that is competent in high multipath environments, suitable for being integrated into the train safe platform ensuring at the same time economy on total cost of operations. Connected cars applications rely also on accurate and safe positioning and have in common with the trains the operational environment and a centralized command and control system. This paper introduce the give and take paradigm to liaise train control systems and autonomous cars stake holders and develop a common GNSS platform. The ambition is to export to the autonomous cars the safety capabilities of train control systems demonstrated during tens of years of operations, and to exploiting the large car\u2019s market potential to lower the GNSS platform costs. The paper starts with the characteristics of the European Railways Train Management Systems (ERTMS) that guarantees the highest safety levels through a platform which is interoperable, standard and certifiable with harmonized procedures. Then we describe the plan to validate and certify the GNSS positioning applications into the ERTMS, which is one of the Game Changer technologies of the ERTMS evolution plan. The synergy with the connected cars is discussed by first introducing the virtual track concept to drive a car on the road as a train on the railways and then by developing the virtual horizon to safely monitor the way ahead detecting obstacles. The roadmap is driven by the ERSAT GGC (Galileo Game Changer) H2020 project, involving the rail community, and the EMERGE initiative, dealing with the automotive sector.",

      "abstract": "Spleen volume estimation using automated image segmentation technique may be used to detect splenomegaly (abnormally enlarged spleen) on Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) scans. In recent years, Deep Convolutional Neural Networks (DCNN) segmentation methods have demonstrated advantages for abdominal organ segmentation. However, variations in both size and shape of the spleen on MRI images may result in large false positive and false negative labeling when deploying DCNN based methods. In this paper, we propose the Splenomegaly Segmentation Network (SSNet) to address spatial variations when segmenting extraordinarily large spleens. SSNet was designed based on the framework of image-to-image conditional generative adversarial networks (cGAN). Specifically, the Global Convolutional Network (GCN) was used as the generator to reduce false negatives, while the Markovian discriminator (PatchGAN) was used to alleviate false positives. A cohort of clinically acquired 3D MRI scans (both T1 weighted and T2 weighted) from patients with splenomegaly were used to train and test the networks. The experimental results demonstrated that a mean Dice coefficient of 0.9260 and a median Dice coefficient of 0.9262 using SSNet on independently tested MRI volumes of patients with splenomegaly.",

Path prediction algorithm is established to estimate UAV flight trajectory to predict conflict threat to manned aircraft in time advances (front-end process of CD&#x0026;R system).

      "abstract": "The vulnerability of technological and administrative systems to cyberattacks has been shown to be high in several cases, which has led to different unwanted consequences. Autonomous ships will also be exposed to the threat of cyberattacks, due to their need for connecting to operational, management and administrative systems onshore. The most critical hazards are possibly not associated with consequences for the ship itself or its cargo, but the threat to infrastructure along the coast and offshore if a ship under alien command is used as a \u201cbattering ram\u201d to cause major structural damage. Even relatively small autonomous ships may pose a real threat, and ships sailing in international waters may come from distant locations. This implies that all autonomous ships may be considered as possible threats. This paper outlines the risk for some infrastructure systems. Even though the probability may be low, such events cannot be ruled out in the future, and the design of autonomous ships must involve a series of risk reducing actions and designs.",

Accordingly, modeling of threat assessment under the condition of a small data set is studied in this paper. First, the operational scenario of a manned/unmanned aerial vehicle is constructed, and feature selection and data preprocessing are performed. Second, to obtain the structure, a modeling method for threat assessment is proposed based on an improved BIC score. Finally, the obtained model is applied to compute the threat probability using the junction tree algorithm. The experimental results show that the method proposed in this paper is an available method for threat assessment under the condition of small data sets.",

      "abstract": "The high mortality rate associated with coronary heart disease (CHD) has driven intensive research in cardiac image analysis. The advent of computed tomography angiogra-phy (CTA) has turned non-invasive diagnosis of cardiovascular anomalies into reality as calcified coronary plaques can be easily identified due to high intensity values. However, detection and quantification of the non-calcified plaques in CTA is still a challenging problem because of their lower intensity values, which are often similar to the nearby blood and muscle tissues. In this work, we propose Bayesian posterior based model for precise quantification of the non-calcified plaques in CTA imagery. The only indicator of non-calcified plaques in CTA is relatively lower intensity. Hence, we exploited intensity variations to discriminate voxels into lumen and plaque classes. Based on the normal coronary segments, we computed the vessel-wall thickness in first step. In the subsequent step, we removed vessel wall from the seg-mented tree and employed Gaussian Mixture Model to compute optimal distribution parameters. In the final step, distribution parameters were employed in Bayesian posterior model to classify voxels into lumen or plaque. A total of 18 CTA volumes were analyzed in this work using two different approaches. According to the experimental results, mean Jaccard overlap is around 88% with respect to the manual expert. In terms of sensitivity, specificity and accuracy, the proposed method achieves 84.13% ,79.15% and 82.02% success, respectively. Conclusion: According to the experimental results, it is shown that the proposed plaque quantification method achieves accuracy equivalent to human experts.",

      "abstract": "As a kind of game-changing combat style, the operation of the UAV swarm in cyberspace is characterized by high effective cost and high concealment, which make it play an important role in the future competition of cyberspace. Due to the lack of actual combat experience and high confidentiality of the cyberspace operation and the UAV swarm operation, the modeling and simulation (M and S) of the operation of the UAV swarm in cyberspace is the vital method for planning the UAV swarm system architecture and designing the tactical methods of the UAV swarm. At present, the research on the M and S of the operation of the UAV swarm in cyberspace is just starting from home and abroad, and there is no corresponding modeling method and concrete model. Taken the Integrated Air Defense System (IADS) as the operational object, the guiding ideology of the M and S of the operation of the UAV swarm in cyberspace was researched from the height of the joint operations, which includes the characteristics of the individual autonomy, the group cooperation, the offensive and defensive antagonism and the electromagnetic-cyber the operation. Then, the model characteristic and elements was analyzed, such as the model system architecture, the operational rule and the intelligent algorithm. On this basis, the \"action model pool\", \"operational rule pool\" and \"intelligent algorithm pool\" would be constructed. Afterwards, the modeling method of the operation of the UAV swarm in cyberspace which based the \u201cRule+ Respond+ Algorithm\u201d (RRA) is proposed, including the modeling framework and main process method of the RRA. The main process included the military concept modeling stage, the operational rules refining stage, the operational rules judgment stage, the action model response stage and the intelligent algorithm solution stage, that the five stages were in sequence, also the main work in each stage was analyzed. At the level of system of system M and S, the modeling focused of the abstraction, extraction and description of the operational rules of the UAV swarm in cyberspace. The description and construction methods of the operational rule are researched, such as the BNF format, the process format, and the operational rules tree graph. Finally, based on the future joint operations, an example of the operation of the UAV swarm in cyberspace is given, then the operational effectiveness is analyzed. The example showed that using nine UAV Swarms to attack IADS in cyberspace would reduce the normal power range of the sensor network by 90% and the warning time by 80.3%.",

      "abstract": "The pervasiveness of small Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs), due to low cost, ease of control, and portability, opens\nthe possibility of their use in urban environments for illegal or adversarial purposes. Such use includes unauthorized\nsurveillance, reconnaissance, and weaponization. Detecting adversarial UAVs in urban environments is difficult. Urban\ncanyons provide shielding from visibility. The small size of quadcopter-type UAVs limits the number of object pixels\navailable for processing, which reduces standoff detection performance. UAVs fly against a background of ground\nmotion clutter which can mask their motion. One possible solution to small UAV detection in urban environments uses\nlow-cost UAV surveillance platforms, equipped with optical sensors, together with computer vision algorithms to detect\nadversarial UAVs in video data. In this paper we adapt the astronomical technique of transit photometry to detect small\nUAVs, operating in urban environments, in video data. Transit photometry, typically used for exo-planet discovery,\ndetects small changes in background brightness due to a transiting object. As the UAV traverses across a bright\nbackground region, for example, the vehicle occludes the background and reduces the perceived brightness. This\nbrightness dip may be used to infer the existence of a potential UAV passing across the background. The transit\nphotometry curve, resulting from this brightness dip, reveals information about the traversing vehicle. We investigate\nmathematical properties of the transit photometry curve and derive a closed-form expression for it. We present numerical\nresults demonstrating the technique on real video data acquired from a small UAV operating in an urban environment.",

First the Voronoi diagram of battle field space is conceived to generate the optimal area of USVs paths. Then the chaotic searching algorithm is used to initialize the collection of paths, which is regard as foods of the ABC algorithm. With the limited data, the initial collection can search the optimal area of paths perfectly. Finally simulations of the multi-USV path planning under various threats have been carried out. Simulation results verify that the I-ABC algorithm can improve the diversity of nectar source and the convergence rate of algorithm. It can increase the adaptability of dynamic battlefield and unexpected threats for USV.",

      "abstract": "Government agencies and military are seeing a rise in drones used for terrorism, destruction and espionage. As recently as a decade ago, UAV technology has been used only by US military. Today, dozens of countries manufacture and operate military-grade drones. Drone technology has been made available around the world. Anyone can purchase a drone from an online retailer. Western military operations as well as critical infrastructure protection agencies experienced multiple drone incidents in the last years, ranging from the use of weaponized drones by ISIS to drones flying over airports or drones breaching airspace of other critical infrastructure. The emergence of threats caused by unfriendly or hostile drones requires a proactive drone detection in order to decide on appropriate defence actions. In this contribution, an open architecture of a UAV detection system including decision support for counter-action is presented. The system is composed of multiple deployable sensor stations, an operation center comprising the operational picture display and the decision support component, and a communication bus consisting of a message-oriented middleware connecting the sub-systems and components. The architectural design specifies the sub-systems, their constitutive components, the information and control flow between the components, the protocols used for data and information exchange, the functionality and responsibility of each component, and the functional parameters. The designed architecture provides a blueprint for a UAV detection and defence actions decision-making system which will allow public protection agencies and military to react timely against threats caused by hostile drones.",

      "abstract": "Summary Petrographic data remains one of fundamental information sources for characterization of hydrocarbon reservoirs. Thin section analysis of sandstone aims to describe depositional textures, major grain types and granulometric distribution, sedimentary structures, grain sorting, mineral composition, structural features, pore types, porosity, etc. These features are exploited to interpret the sedimentary environments, to predict the distribution of sedimentary bodies and their geometry which determines a recovery factor and other key reservoir exploitation characteristics. To conduct these studies one is to segment thin section images first \u2013 to partition them into grains, fractures, cleavages, pores, cement. The segmentation process is time-consuming as it is carried out manually or with specialized software that requires a proper recipe preparation for each image. The segmentation accuracy directly shapes the quality of further petrographic analysis. The goal of work is to develop a fully automatic algorithm for segmentation of thin section images for sandstone and further analysis of partitioned objects. The developed algorithm combines both image processing (IP) and deep learning (DL) approaches. IP methods exploit color intensity and local textural information to segment key structural elements in thin section image: voids (pores and fractures). The combination of DL and IP methods exploit primary information from images to solve semantic and instance segmentation problems for grains and to classify grains, cement and pores. Implementing of DL approaches demands a comprehensive training sample, full enough to have a reasonable segmentation accuracy. Thereby, the dataset of labeled images has been prepared manually. The developed algorithm has been efficiently applied for thin section analysis of sandstone. It has showed not only high agreement with manually processed thin sections and tremendous working time optimization, but more consistent results of segmentation as well. The algorithm plays a role of auxiliary tool that simplifies significantly the petrographic analysis of sandstone: most routine processes are automated; each thin section specimen can be processed statistically in a straightforward manner.",

      "abstract": "The wireless local area networks (WLANs) have been widely deployed with the rapid development of mobile devices and have further been brought into new applications with infrastructure mobility due to the growth of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs). However, the WLANs still face persistent challenge on increasing the network throughput to meet the customer&#x2019;s requirement and fight against the node mobility. Interference is a well-known issue that would degrade the network performance due to the broadcast characteristics of the wireless signals. Moreover, with infrastructure mobility, the interference becomes the key obstacle in pursuing the channel capacity. Legacy interference management mechanism through the channel access control in the MAC layer design of the 802.11 standard has some well-known drawbacks, such as exposed and hidden terminal problems, inefficient rate adaptation, and retransmission schemes, making the efficient interference management an everlasting research topic over the years. Recently, interference management through exploiting physical layer mechanisms has attracted much research interest and has been proven to be a promising way to improve the network throughput, especially under the infrastructure mobility scenarios which provides more indicators for node dynamics. In this paper, we introduce a series of representative physical layer techniques and analyze how they are exploited for interference management to improve the network performance. We also provide some discussions about the research challenges and give potential future research topics in this area.",

      "abstract": "With the rapid growth of wireless medical sensor networks (WMSNs) based healthcare applications, protecting both the privacy and security from illegitimate users, are major concern issues since patient\u2019s precise information is vital for the proper diagnosis procedure. So, authentication protocol is one of the efficient mechanisms to deal with trustworthy and authentic users. Several authentication protocols have been proposed in WMSNs environment. However, the most of these protocols are so susceptible to security threats and not suitable for practical use. In this article, recently proposed Amin et al.\u2019s authentication scheme is reviewed and some vulnerabilities like off-line password guessing attack, user impersonation attack, known session-key temporary information attack, the revelation of secret parameters, and identity guessing attack are pointed out. To overcome all the above mentioned vulnerabilities, we have proposed an enhanced three-factor based remote user authentication protocol in WMSNs environment. Further, the proposed protocol is validated using Burrows\u2013Abadi\u2013Needham logic and then simulated using Automated Validation of Internet Security Protocols and Applications tool. Moreover, the security analysis ensures that the proposed protocol is well protected from various types of malicious attacks. In addition, the performance evaluation shows better efficiency and suitability of our protocol over other related protocols.",

      "abstract": "In view of the take-off process of an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) with high-aspect-ratio flying wing configurations, the influences of ground effects on longitudinal aerodynamic characteristics of the UAV were investigated. By using a numerical simulation method, the effects of different angles of attack, heights from the ground, and take-off velocity on the UAV were studied. Moreover, based on comparisons with test data in previous literature, the numerical calculation method was verified to be accurate. The height from the ground is the primary factor influencing longitudinal aerodynamic characteristics of the UAV. With the increase in height from the ground, the lift and drag coefficients of the UAV, and its pitching stability, increased. When the angle of attack was small, a large suction area was generated on the lower surface of wings with a large suction amplitude therewith. This results in a large range of downwash. As the angle of attack increased, the lower surface of the trailing edge for wings presents weakening downwash. As the take-off velocity rose, the suction area on the lower surface of the UAV, and its amplitude, gradually decreased, and the negative pressure on the upper surface also decreased to a certain extent. The research results can provide a certain theoretical basis for the safe design of take-off operations for high-aspect-ratio UAVs.DOI: http://dx.doi.org/10.5755/j01.mech.24.5.20934",

      "abstract": "The use of GNSS positioning in highly automated systems, like packet delivering using drones or self-driving cars, demands a reliable position estimation. One major risk to the position estimation is the so called spoofing threat. A spoofer fakes satellite signals in order to mislead a GNSS receiver into estimating a wrong user position. A lot of research focuses on the detection and mitigation of spoofing by evaluating several metrics implemented in the receiver. However, beforehand it should be investigated under which conditions a receiver is affected by spoofing. In this work a simulation tool is described to simulate a scenario, where a receiver structure processes a signal containing an authentic and a spoofing signal. The parameters of the spoofing signal are variated. These simulations are repeated with different receiver settings in order to evaluate robust configurations for GNSS receivers. The results show that especially the coherent integration time in the receiver\u2019s tracking loops has a large impact on the vulnerability of the receiver.",

      "abstract": "The hydrodynamic characteristics of autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs) play a significant role in the design and analysis of their maneuverability. This paper evaluates the effects of the Reynolds (Re) number on the hydrodynamic characteristics of AUV for various angles of attack (AOA). To estimate the hydrodynamic parameters, a numerical modelling based on computational fluid dynamics (CFD) is employed. Reynolds numbers between 2\uf0cd106 and 150\uf0cd106 were examined at -10\u00ba to 10\u00ba AOAs. Experimental tests for the same AUV in Re = 2\uf0cd106 in the water tunnel were carried out for CFD validation. A comparison of the results showed an acceptable agreement between the numerical method and the experimental results. The results show that hydrodynamic parameters can be a function of Re and converge on a constant in a limited value when the Re number increases. Results of independent parameters, can be used for full-scale without the establishment of dynamic similarity.",

      "abstract": "Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) suffers from the threat of spoofing attacks. To protect low-cost commercial off the shelf (COTS) receivers when spoofing attack occurs, an effective countermeasure is to locate the spoofer and somehow deactivate the spoofer. To this end, in this paper, a prototype system for spoofer localization is developed, in which the time of arrival (TOA) based localization technique is used. The system consists of four stand-alone GNSS receivers, which are connected via wireless communication modules for data collection. In order to demonstrate the feasibility of this system, a spoofing attack is considered where the spoofing signal can be detected and identified by receiver autonomous integrity monitoring (RAIM). Then, the spoofer is located by measuring the TOAs of the spoofing signal upon arriving at the four receivers. A series of field tests are carried out and demonstrate the feasibility of the system. Moreover, the factors that influence the performance of the system are also analyzed and validated by the field tests.",

For example, \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Smart Bird\u00e2\u20ac\u009d is discovered by FESTO in which the seagull is taken as a concept.  The battery consumption is more on these UAVs due to their complicated flapping mechanism. This project deals with an UAV (ornithopter) with morphed wing, in which the wing can be foldable to increase the gliding speed. By using such type of wings, endurance and range can be increased. A laboratory scale ornithopter with flapping wing mechanism is fabricated and tested. The flight speed of almost 45mph can be achieved. This mechanism reduces the battery consumption, for e.g. for 8V input, 4 flaps per second is demonstrated by test. UAV has the ability to attack enemy territory without being identified by the RADAR. Moreover, it can be used to drop bombs from high altitude with precision by using high resolution cameras. To overcome this difficulty, the ornithopter with morphing and flapping mechanism concept is considered in this project.",

In this work, we have used 2-dimensional scale, rotation and translation invariant Generic Fourier Descriptor (GFD) features and classified targets as a drone or bird by a neural network. For the training of this system, a large dataset composed of birds and drones is gathered\n from open sources. We have achieved up to 85.3% overall correct classification rate.\n      ",

      "abstract": "A novel length adaptive method is proposed for time domain equalizer by taking the channel attenuation ratio between different multipath components into account in UAV-UAV and UAV-ground channels. Then, considering received image quality, the minimum bit error ratio (MBER) criterion is exploited to design adaptive equalizers for both amplify-and-forward (AF) and decode-and-forward (DF) relaying systems by the proposed length adaptive method. Results show that proposed MBER adaptive equalizers outperform the traditional ones in both AF relaying and DF relaying as channel attenuation ratio in UAV-ground channel increases. Moreover, DF outperforms AF as channel attenuation ratio in UAV-UAV channel increases. Furthermore, bit error ratio (BER) and peak signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR) performances in both AF and DF are evaluated to show the enhancement by the proposed MBER adaptive equalizers.",

      "abstract": "Survivability has always been of interest in the defense of any armored vehicles. There has been many reports and papers on the survivability of U.S. Army ground vehicles. A Survivability severity model can be best described as the analogy to the layers of an onion, in which each layer of onion describes a different severity level and the phase of threat detected and severity to apply countermeasures. The objective of this paper is to suggest an evaluation tool that contains an algorithm and procedure for the reliability of manned and unmanned ground vehicles. A decision-making system is proposing for the theoretical survivability and is calculated from a threat level in the form of severity. A generic framework algorithm, consists of both linear and non-linear vehicle dynamics systems, and is included in this paper, which consists of the Fuzzy approach and various scenarios, based on straight path projection. Further, to increase the level of rigor, a layered fuzzy control system using various vehicle dynamics parameters [1] and a methodology for designing an adaptive hierarchical fuzzy model [2] and to accommodate various system parameters dependencies, are describing in this paper as a part of the survivability model. It is hoped that different users will tailor this evaluation tool and used extensively by various research workers working in different area. Several probabilistic cases were included in this paper and implemented by converting to linguistic fuzzy parameters to evaluate the algorithm. A simulation model is designed using supervisory fuzzy rule set and several simulation studies have been done which illustrate the effectiveness of the given approach. The result is a robust d flexible control system.",

      "abstract": "Computer-based facial recognition algorithms exploit the unique characteristics of faces in images. However, in non-cooperative situations these unique characteristics are often disturbed. In this study, we examine the effect of six different factors on face detection in an unconstrained imaging environment: image brightness, image contrast, focus measure, eyewear, gender, and occlusion. The aim of this study is twofold: first, to quantify detection rates of conventional Haar cascade algorithms across these six factors; and second, to propose methods for automatically labeling datasets whose size prohibits manual labeling. First, we manually classify a uniquely challenging dataset comprising 9,688 images of passengers in vehicles acquired from a roadside camera system. Next, we quantify how each of the aforementioned factors affect face detection on this dataset. Of the six factors studied, occlusion had the most significant impact, resulting in a 54% decrease in detection rate between unoccluded and severely occluded faces in our unique dataset. Finally, we provide a methodology for data analytics of large datasets where manual labeling of the whole dataset is not possible.",

      "abstract": "The Internet of Drones (IoD) provides the coordinated access to controlled airspace for the Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (called drones). The on-going cheaper costs of sensors and processors, and also wireless connectivity make it feasible to use the drones for several applications ranging from military to civilian. Since most of the applications using the drones involved in the IoD are real-time based applications, the users (external parties) usually have their interest in getting the real-time services from the deployed drones belonging to a particular fly zone. To address this important issue in the IoD, there is a great need of an efficient and secure user authentication approach in which an authorized user (for example, a driver of an ambulance) in the IoD environment can be given access to the data directly from an accessed drone. In this article, we first discuss an authentication model used in the IoD communication. We then discuss some security challenges and requirements for the IoD environment. A taxonomy of various security protocols in the IoD environment is also discussed. We then emphasis on the study of some recently proposed user authentication schemes for the IoD communication. A detailed comparative study is done based on functionality features, security attacks, and also communication and computation costs. Through the rigorous comparative study of the existing schemes, we identify the strengths and weaknesses of the user authentication schemes for the IoD communication. Finally, we identify some of the challenges for the IoD that need to be addressed in the coming future.",

      "abstract": "One of the greatest dangers for first-responders when approaching a disaster site is their lack of incident-related information. This problem can be overcome by deploying and operating a range of high-performance sensors mounted on an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV). For an initial survey and subsequently detailed reconnaissance of disaster areas where radiation sources represent a threat for rescue operations, the following specialized equipment can be used: the RIEGL VUX-1UAV laser scanner, a highly sensitive gamma radiation probe provided by CBRN Protection and the RiCOPTER-M UAV. An embedded processing and radio communication system integrated onboard the UAV enables real-time access to georeferenced 3D LiDAR pointclouds and gamma radiation levels. Precise localization of the gamma radiation sources and simulation of corresponding radiation activity patterns is achieved by automatic processing on the ground, taking the up-to-date topography into account. The results are displayed to the person in charge of response forces in an intuitive and user-friendly way on, e.g., a tablet computer in real-time and while the UAV is still in the air. Resolution and precision are continuously increased by a semi-autonomous flight path generation approach. This takes into account real-time radiation measurements in order to fly additional lines over automatically detected locations of specific interest. We present results of extended field tests with live radiation sources to demonstrate real-time data acquisition, processing, and refinement. The system shown represents a highly flexible and possibly life-saving asset for first-responders in time-critical scenarios.",

      "abstract": "This paper discusses a modular system architecture for detection, classification and localisation of Unmanned Aerial System (UAS) targets, consisting of intelligent Autonomous Sensor Modules (ASMs), a High-Level Decision Making Module (HLDMM), a middleware integration layer and an end-user GUI, under the previously-reported SAPIENT framework. This enables plug and play sensor integration and autonomous fusion, including prediction of the trajectory of the vehicle for sensor cueing, multi-modal sensor fusion and target hand-off.<p>  </p> The SAPIENT Counter-UAS (C-UAS) system was successfully demonstrated in a live trial against a range of UAS targets flown in a variety of attack trajectories, using radar and Electro-Optic (EO) C-UAS ASMs. In addition, the trial also demonstrated the use of synthetic sensors, on their own and in combination with real sensors. Outputs of all the available sensors were tracked and fused by the Cubica SAPIENT HLDMM which then steered narrow field-of-view cameras onto the predicted 3D position of the UAS. The operator was provided with a map-based view showing alerts and tracks to provide situational awareness, together with snapshots from the EO sensor and video feeds from the steerable narrow field of view cameras. <p>  </p>This demonstrates an effective C-UAS system operating entirely autonomously, with autonomous detection, localisation, classification, tracking, fusion and sensor management, leading to \u201ceyes on\u201d the aerial threat, and all happening with zero operator intervention and in real-time.",

      "abstract": "With the advent of Internet of things (IoT) and cloud computing technologies, we are in the era of automation, device-to-device (D2D) and machine-to-machine (M2M) communications. Automated vehicles have recently gained a huge attention worldwide, and it has created a new wave of revolution in automobile industries. However, in order to fully establish automated vehicles and their connectivity to the surroundings, <i>security</i>, <i>privacy</i>, and <i>dependability</i> always remain a crucial issue. One cannot deny the fact that such automatic vehicles are highly vulnerable to different kinds of security attacks. Also, today&#x2019;s such systems are built from generic components. Prior analysis of different attack trends and vulnerabilities enables us to deploy security solutions effectively. Moreover, scientific research has shown that a &#x201c;group&#x201d; can perform better than individuals in making decisions and predictions. Therefore, this paper deals with the measurable <i>security</i>, <i>privacy</i>, and <i>dependability</i> of automated vehicles through the <i>crowd-based intelligence approach</i> that is inspired from <i>swarm intelligence</i>. We have studied <i>three</i> use case scenarios of automated vehicles and systems with vehicular fog and have analyzed the <i>security</i>, <i>privacy</i>, and <i>dependability</i> metrics of such systems. Our systematic approaches to measuring efficient system configuration, <i>security</i>, <i>privacy</i>, and <i>dependability</i> of automated vehicles are essential for getting the overall picture of the system such as design patterns, best practices for configuration of system, metrics, and measurements.",

      "abstract": "<p>When I began experiencing chest pain that was different from my usual heartburn symptoms, I denied I could possibly be having a heart attack, but chewed 4 baby aspirin just in case. Despite years of community education about the need to call 911 and seek immediate emergency care when experiencing signs and symptoms of a heart attack, more than 350,000 individuals experienced an out-of-hospital cardiac arrest in 2016. Of those, only 12% survived. Bystander recognition of cardiac arrest and prompt intervention with cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) and rapid defibrillation is essential for out-of-hospital survival. Not everyone is fortunate enough to have the right people with the right equipment in the right place at the right time. I don\u2019t know why, but I was one of the lucky ones.</p>",

      "abstract": "Autonomous Underwater Vehicles (AUVs) equipped with high-resolution side-scan sonars (SSS) are used to carry out preliminary surveys of potentially hazardous areas in order to counter the threat posed by naval mines and reduce risk to personnel. The detection and classification of mine-like objects is conducted offline, after a scan has been completed while the actual identification and neutralization of potential targets is executed in a separate minehunting operation. In this paper the various influences on the imaging sonar system and, moreover, the resulting sonar imagery are assessed with regard to affecting the Probability of Detection and Classification (PDC). Image quality, sharpness and Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR) are among the more obvious and straightforwardly quantifiable factors. The complexity of a sonar image, however, can have a significant impact as well. Image lacunarity is used to characterize the seafloor in order to assess the corresponding minehunting difficulty. Additional factors under consideration are the heading angle of the AUV at any given measurement position as well as horizontal spreading and potential overlapping of successive sonic pulses.",

      "abstract": "Digital image processing is one of the most widely used computer vision technologies in biomedical engineering. In the present modern ophthalmological practice, biomarkers analysis through digital fundus image processing analysis greatly contributes to vision science. This further facilitates developments in medical imaging, enabling this robust technology to attain extensive scopes in biomedical engineering platform. Various diagnostic techniques are used to analyze retinal microvasculature image to enable geometric features measurements such as vessel tortuosity, branching angles, branching coefficient, vessel diameter, and fractal dimension. These extracted markers or characterized fundus digital image features provide insights and relates quantitative retinal vascular topography abnormalities to various pathologies such as diabetic retinopathy, macular degeneration, hypertensive retinopathy, transient ischemic attack, neovascular glaucoma, and cardiovascular diseases. Apart from that, this noninvasive research tool is automated, allowing it to be used in large-scale screening programs, and all are described in this present review paper. This paper will also review recent research on the image processing-based extraction techniques of the quantitative retinal microvascular feature. It mainly focuses on features associated with the early symptom of transient ischemic attack or sharp stroke.",

      "abstract": "The detection and tracking of UAV\u2019s is a critical task for public and military security. The main are the low flight height and the small radar cross section (RCS). The problems increase in an urban environment with many high buildings, especially when tall buildings block the line of sight. A new concept of distributed radar sensors was developed to close this gap. To reduce the impact of radar shadows in urban canyons, a surveillance grid of optical and radar sensors is necessary which covers the complete urban environment. The radar sensors build up different security sectors and monitor all access routes for attacking UAVs. Sophisticated cameras which offer night vision capabilities complete the sensor network to reduce the false alarm rate through these regular, declared UAV flights. Cameras allow the integration of a man in the loop which has the final responsibility to define a target as a threat or not. The system supports the operator with a database which based on optical and radar signature of most commercially available UAV\u2019s.",

      "abstract": "Modern Department of Defense mission systems are very complex and therefore arduous to defend, especially in the cyber domain. A major cause for this concern arises from the fact that implementation of security protections occur at a local scale, while the important operational security issues stem from a global perspective of the system, e.g., mission assurance. Being able to understand network-wide implications of local cyber protections has the potential to significantly impact the strategies we use to protect modern mission systems. In this work, we present a graph-theoretic perspective on this problem, which is based on a framework for modeling and assessing the integrated cyber-physical dynamics of complex systems. Under the framework, these dynamics (and their relationships) are modeled as a graph and then analyzed using processing techniques from graphtheory. We demonstrate the utility of this framework by conducting insider-attack threat analysis and show how the application of security protections at a local scale impact network-wide security properties from an insider perspective. As a test case, we study the problem of search and rescue (SAR) using unmanned aerial vehicle teams. Unmanned vehicle teams engaged in SAR are prototypical cyber-physical systems, in which local intrusions may cause global disruptions. Here, we describe how the insider modeling framework for cyber-physical dynamics applies to this problem and present results of a network-wide assessment of security properties of the system. We use this assessment to design a security protection for the system in which we use cryptographically secure computation techniques to limit the amount of information sharing required between system components without degrading the correct operation of the system. We show how the application of these techniques on a local scale impacts the security properties of the system on a global scale.",

      "abstract": "Myocardial scar, a non-viable tissue which forms in the myocardium due to insufficient blood supply to the heart muscle, is one of the leading causes of life-threatening heart disorders, including arrhythmias. Accurate reconstruction of myocardial scar geometry is important for diagnosis and clinicial prognosis of the patients with ischemic cardiomyopathy. The 3D late gadolinium-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging (LGE-MRI) is increasingly being investigated for assessing myocardial tissue viability. For applications, such as computational modeling of cardiac electrophysiology aimed at stratifying patient risk for post-infarction arrhythmias, segmentation and reconstruction of the intact geometry of scar is required. However, manual analysis and segmentation of myocardial scar from 3D LGE-MRI is a tedious task. Therefore, semi-automated and fully-automated segmentation algorithms are highly desirable in a clinical setting. In this study, we developed an approach to segment the myocardial scar from 3D LGE-MR images using a continuous max-flow (CMF) method. The data term comprised of a distribution matching term for scar and normal myocardium and a boundary smoothness term for the scar boundaries. The region-of-interest for the scar segmentation is constrained, using manually segmented myocardium. We evaluated our CMF method for accuracy by comparing it to manual scar delineations using 3D LGE-MR images of 34 patients. We compare the results of the CMF technique to ones by conventional full-width-at-half-maximum (FWHM) and signal-threshold-to-reference-mean (STRM) methods. The CMF method yielded a Dice similarity coefficient (DSC) of 72&plusmn;18&percnt; and an absolute volume error (&vert;V E&vert;) of 15.42&plusmn;14.1 <i>cm</i><sup>3</sup>. Overall, the CMF method outperformed the state-of-the-art methods for all reported metrics in 3D scar segmentation except for the recall value which STRM 2-SD performed better than CMF on average.",

      "abstract": "In this paper, we exploit prior information from global positioning systems and inertial measurement units to speed up the process of large scene reconstruction from images acquired by Unmanned Aerial Vehicles. We utilize weak pose information and intrinsic parameter to obtain the projection matrix for each view. As compared to unmanned aerial vehicles' flight altitude, topographic relief can usually be ignored, we assume that the scene is flat and use weak perspective camera to get projective transformations between two views. Furthermore, we propose an overlap criterion and select potentially matching view pairs between projective transformed views. A robust global structure from motion method is used for image based reconstruction. Our real world experiments show that the approach is accurate, scalable and computationally efficient. Moreover, projective transformations between views can also be used to eliminate false matching.",

      "abstract": "In typical Intelligence Surveillance and Reconnaissance (ISR) missions, persistent surveillance is commonly defined as the exercise of automatic intelligence discovery by monitoring a wide area coverage at a high altitude leveraging an aerial platform (manned or unmanned). It can be large enough to carry a matrix of high resolution cameras and a rack of high performance computing images processing and exploitation units (PEU). The majority of the small unmanned aerial vehicles (sUAV) are able to carry optics payloads, allowing them to take aerial images from strategic viewpoints. This capability constitutes a key enabler for an immense number of applications, such as crowd monitoring, search and rescue, surveillance scenario, industrial inspection and so on. The constrained onboard processing power in addition to the strict limit in the flying time of sUAV are amongst the serious challenges that have to be overcome to enable a cost effective persistent surveillance based on sUAV platforms. In this paper, we conduct a feasibility study for developing a potential sUAV based persistent surveillance system with tethered power supply.",

      "abstract": "Recently, unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) plays an important role in many applications because of its high flexibility and low cost. To realize reliable UAV communications, a fundamental work is to investigate the propagation characteristics of the channels. In this paper, we propose path loss models for the UAV air-to-air (AA) scenario based on machine learning. A ray-tracing software is employed to generate samples for multiple routes in a typical urban environment, and different altitudes of Tx and Rx UAVs are taken into consideration. Two machine-learning algorithms, Random Forest and KNN, are exploited to build prediction models on the basis of the training data. The prediction performance of trained models is assessed on the test set according to the metrics including the mean absolute error (MAE) and root mean square error (RMSE). Meanwhile, two empirical models are presented for comparison. It is shown that the machine-learning-based models are able to provide high prediction accuracy and acceptable computational efficiency in the AA scenario. Moreover, Random Forest outperforms other models and has the smallest prediction errors. Further investigation is made to evaluate the impacts of five different parameters on the path loss. It is demonstrated that the path visibility is crucial for the path loss.",

We conducted a systematic review examining the use of drones for health-related purposes.MethodsA search was conducted in Medline, Embase, Global Health, Scopus, CINAHL and SciELO. Experimental studies were selected if the population included human subjects, the intervention was the use of UAVs and there was a health-related outcome.ResultsOf 500 results, five met inclusion criteria during an initial search. An updated search yielded four additional studies. Nine studies, all in high-income countries, were included for systematic syntheses: four studies addressed out-of-hospital cardiac arrest emergencies, three assessed drones for identification of people after accidents, one used drones to transport blood samples and one used drones to improve surgical procedures in war zones.ConclusionsResearch on the use of drones in healthcare is limited to simulation scenarios, and this review did not retrieve any studies from low- and middle-income countries.",

      "abstract": "Unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) today play an increasing role in many public missions such as border surveillance, wildlife surveys, military training, weather monitoring, local law enforcement and so on. Due to its advantages such as low life-cycle costs and fewer restrictions on use, UAV has become important military weapon, then Counter-Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (CUAV) technology also become a research focus. Small drones that are not easily detectable have become an emerging threat. Low-cost and effective counter-UAV methods are explored for many countries. The CUAV technologies include traditional air defense weapon system, electronic warfare, UAV, laser weapons and so on. With the development of high-power lasers and continuous advances in beam control technology, CUAV laser weapons will become more practical.",

      "abstract": "Imaging and parameter estimation of moving targets in airborne single-antenna high-resolution synthetic aperture radar (SAR) system is affected by motion errors, which cause defocusing and dislocation of moving targets. Motion errors derive from platform flight deviation and unknown target velocity and estimating all motion errors once is difficult because both aspects influence each other, especially in unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) systems. We find that the platform flight deviation has the same effect on stationary targets and moving ones. Exploiting this similarity, we propose a novel ground moving target motion compensation method. Platform flight errors are extracted from stationary targets by autofocus algorithms and compensated for moving targets. And then Hough transform (HT) and Map-Drift (MD) technique is used to estimate the radial velocity and the along-track velocity, and range cell migration correction (RCMC) is completed by estimated velocities. Furthermore, PGA technique is adopted to estimate and correct residual phase errors. The effectiveness of the proposed algorithm is validated by the real data.",

      "abstract": "The development and operation of liquid-argon time-projection chambers for neutrino physics has created a need for new approaches to pattern recognition in order to fully exploit the imaging capabilities offered by this technology. Whereas the human brain can excel at identifying features in the recorded events, it is a significant challenge to develop an automated, algorithmic solution. The Pandora Software Development Kit provides functionality to aid the design and implementation of pattern-recognition algorithms. It promotes the use of a multi-algorithm approach to pattern recognition, in which individual algorithms each address a specific task in a particular topology. Many tens of algorithms then carefully build up a picture of the event and, together, provide a robust automated pattern-recognition solution. This paper describes details of the chain of over one hundred Pandora algorithms and tools used to reconstruct cosmic-ray muon and neutrino events in the MicroBooNE detector. Metrics that assess the current pattern-recognition performance are presented for simulated MicroBooNE events, using a selection of final-state event topologies.",

      "abstract": "Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) have become more readily available in the past 5 years and are proliferating rapidly. New aviation regulations are accelerating the use of UAVs in many applications. As a result, there are increasing concerns of potential air threats in situational environments including commercial airport security and drug trafficking. In this study, radiometric signatures of commercially available miniature UAVs is determined for long-wave infrared (LWIR) bands in both clear sky and partial cloudy conditions. Results are presented that compare LWIR performance estimates for the detection of commercial UAVs via infrared search and track (IRST) systems with two candidate sensors.",

      "abstract": "The ability to rapidly assess damage to military infrastructure after an attack is the object of ongoing research. In the case\nof runways, sensor systems capable of detecting and locating craters, spall, unexploded ordinance, and debris are necessary\nto quickly and efficiently deploy assets to restore a minimum airfield operating surface. We describe measurements\nperformed using two commercial, robotic scanning LiDAR systems during a round of testing at an airfield. The LiDARs\nwere used to acquire baseline data and to conduct scans after two rounds of demolition and placement of artifacts for the\nentire runway. Configuration of the LiDAR systems was sub-optimal due to availability of only two platforms for\nplacement of sensors on the same side of the runway. Nevertheless, results prove that the spatial resolution, accuracy, and\ncadence of the sensors is sufficient to develop point cloud representations of the runway sufficient to distinguish craters,\ndebris and most UXO. Location of a complementary set of sensors on the opposite side of the runway would alleviate the\nobserved shadowing, increase the density of the registered point cloud, and likely allow detection of smaller artifacts.\nImportantly, the synoptic data acquired by these static LiDAR sensors is dense enough to allow registration (fusion) with\nthe smaller, denser, targeted point cloud data acquired at close range by unmanned aerial systems. The paper will also\ndiscuss point cloud manipulation and 3D object recognition algorithms that the team is developing for automatic detection\nand geolocation of damage and objects of interest.",

The classification of the LSS UAVs is given. The existing threats of using LSS UAVs are divided into three categories. Special attention is paid to the third category of threats, the main feature of which is a high level of training of the operator. Main advantages and drawbacks of LSS UAVs are considered. It is determined that the best strategy is to employ a hierarchy of countermeasures including regulatory countermeasures (prevention, deterrence, denial), passive countermeasures (detection and interruption) and active countermeasures (destruction). State of the art and current problems of possible countermeasures are analysed. The most promising LSS UAVs\u2019 counteraction technologies are described. Most attention is paid to specialized sensors and modern active counteraction means, such as programmable air burst munition and high\u2010energy laser systems.",

      "abstract": "Surveillance systems are essential for the protection of military compounds and critical infrastructures. Automatic recognition of suspicious activities can augment human operators to find relevant threats. Common solutions for behavior analysis or action recognition require large amounts of training data. However, suspicious activities and threats are rare events, and the modus operandi of enemies may suddenly change, which makes it unrealistic to obtain sufficient training data in realistic situations. Therefore, we developed a demonstrator for the recognition of suspicious activity that allows users to easily define new alerts based on their expert knowledge. We developed basic modules for the computation of object detections, tracking and action recognition to generate features. The user is able to specify complex behavior with Symbols and Sentences. Symbols are low-level descriptions to analyze combinations of features. An example of a symbol is \u2018approach_gate\u2019, which consists of three conditions related to: the distance to the gate, the speed of a person and whether a person is on the compound. Sentences are high-level descriptions to analyze temporal ordering. An example of a sentence with temporal ordering is \u2018entering the compound\u2019, which consists of first approaching the gate, then entering the gate, and finally being on the compound. The demonstrator is compliant with the SAPIENT architecture, which uses multiple low-level Autonomous Sensor Modules (ASM) and a High-Level Decision Making Module (HLDMM). Features and symbols are computed in an ASM and sentences are computed in the HLDMM. Our demonstrator is tested on a multi-camera dataset to recognize suspicious behavior (e.g., digging for placement of improvised explosive devices, climbing over a fence, approaching the compound, and car standing on the road), allowing the user to interactively creates and modifies both symbols and sentences to mitigate new threats that were not implemented during design time.",

      "abstract": "In 2016, the European Unions\u2019 Research and Innovation program Horizon 2020 launched the multi-national project called HEritage Resiliance Against CLimatic Events on Site (HERACLES). The goal of this project is to design, validate and promote effective and sustainable solutions against potential threats climatic changes can bring about on the cultural heritage. For this purpose, knowledge and experiences of multiple research facilities and versatile groups of end-users in different European countries will be bundled and synergetically benefited of. In this paper, we will provide an overview about HERACLES project while a particular focus will be put on the activities concerning close-range Remote Sensing data processing. By exploiting image and laser data acquired from UAVs and from the ground, we strive for precise and reliable 3D models that are useful for representation of the scene on the desired level of detail and thus for assessing potential damages and estimating risks. From oblique UAV-borne imagery, we will obtain textured airborne 3D models using photogrammetric methods of image alignment, dense point cloud reconstruction, meshing and texturing. To provide coverage for the objects\u2019 interiors, very dense point clouds from terrestrial laser scans can be additionally captured. A triangle mesh is obtained from these points and textured by means of terrestrial high-resolution photos, whereby the registration took place using a point-based method. We identified two main challenges: first, the reconstruction results from high-resolution UAV images were not always satisfying due to a low coverage; to cope with this, extensive interactive corrections must be undertaken. Moreover, seamless merging of triangle meshes provided by aerial photogrammetric reconstruction and by terrestrial laser scans is cumbersome because of varying density and accuracy of 3D points in both meshes.",

      "abstract": "As the number of robots used in warehouses and manufacturing increases, so too does the need for robots to be able to manipulate objects, not only independently, but also in collaboration with humans and other robots. Our ability to effectively coordinate our actions with fellow humans encompasses several behaviours that are collectively referred to as joint action, and has inspired advances in human-robot interaction by leveraging our natural ability to interpret implicit cues. However, our capacity to efficiently coordinate on object manipulation tasks remains an advantageous process that is yet to be fully exploited in robotic applications. Humans achieve this form of coordination by combining implicit communication (where information is inferred) and explicit communication (direct communication through an established channel) in varying degrees according to the task at hand. Although these two forms of communication have previously been implemented in robotic systems, no system exists that integrates the two in a task-dependent adaptive manner. In this paper, we review existing work on joint action in human-robot interaction, and analyse the state-of-the-art in robot-robot interaction that could act as a foundation for future cooperative object manipulation approaches. We identify key mechanisms that must be developed in order for robots to collaborate more effectively, with other robots and humans, on object manipulation tasks in shared autonomy spaces.",

      "abstract": "This paper considers the problem of fault detection and identification (FDI) in applications carried out by a group of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) with visual cameras. In many cases, the UAVs have cameras mounted onboard for other applications, and these cameras can be used as bearing-only sensors to estimate the relative orientation of another UAV. The idea is to exploit the redundant information provided by these sensors onboard each of the UAVs to increase safety and reliability, detecting faults on UAV internal sensors that cannot be detected by the UAVs themselves. Fault detection is based on the generation of residuals which compare the expected position of a UAV, considered as target, with the measurements taken by one or more UAVs acting as observers that are tracking the target UAV with their cameras. Depending on the available number of observers and the way they are used, a set of strategies and policies for fault detection are defined. When the target UAV is being visually tracked by two or more observers, it is possible to obtain an estimation of its 3D position that could replace damaged sensors. Accuracy and reliability of this vision-based cooperative virtual sensor (CVS) have been evaluated experimentally in a multivehicle indoor testbed with quadrotors, injecting faults on data to validate the proposed fault detection methods.",

      "abstract": "This paper proposes an effective approach for modelling and assessing the risks associated with unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) integrated into national airspace system (NAS). Two critical hazards with UAV operations are considered and analyzed, which are ground impacts and midair collisions. Threats to fatalities that result from the two hazards are the focus in the proposed method. In order to realize ground impact assessment, a multifactor risk model is designed by calculating system reliability required to meet a target level of safety for different UAV categories. Both fixed-wing and rotary-wing UAVs are taken into account under a real scenario that is further partitioned into different zones to make the evaluation more precise. Official territory and population data of the operation scenario are incorporated, as well as UAV self-properties. Casualty area of impacting debris can be obtained as well as the probability of fatal injuries on the ground. Sheltering factors are not neglected and defined as four types based on the real scenario. When midair collision fatality risk is estimated, a model of aircraft collisions based on the density of civil flight in different regions over Chinese airspace is proposed. In the model, a relative collision area and flying speed between UAVs and manned aircraft are constructed to calculate expected frequency of fatalities for each province correspondingly. Truthful data with different numbers of UAVs is incorporated in the model with the expected number of fatalities after a collision is included. Experimental simulations are made to evaluate the ground impacts and midair collisions when UAVs operate in the NAS.",

      "abstract": "This paper presents a visual-based approach that allows an Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) to detect and track a cooperative flying vehicle autonomously using a monocular camera. The algorithms are based on template matching and morphological filtering, thus being able to operate within a wide range of relative distances (i.e., from a few meters up to several tens of meters), while ensuring robustness against variations of illumination conditions, target scale and background. Furthermore, the image processing chain takes full advantage of navigation hints (i.e., relative positioning and own-ship attitude estimates) to improve the computational efficiency and optimize the trade-off between correct detections, false alarms and missed detections. Clearly, the required exchange of information is enabled by the cooperative nature of the formation through a reliable inter-vehicle data-link. Performance assessment is carried out by exploiting flight data collected during an ad hoc experimental campaign. The proposed approach is a key building block of cooperative architectures designed to improve UAV navigation performance either under nominal GNSS coverage or in GNSS-challenging environments.",

In this paper, we investigate a novel multidepot UAV routing problem with consideration of weapon configuration in the UAV and the attacking time window of the target. A mixed-integer linear programming model is developed to jointly optimize three kinds of decisions: the weapon configuration strategy in the UAV, the routing strategy of target, and the allocation strategy of weapons to targets. An adaptive large neighborhood search (ALNS) algorithm is proposed for solving the problem, which is tested by randomly generated instances covering the small, medium, and large sizes. Experimental results confirm the effectiveness and robustness of the proposed ALNS algorithm.",

Due to the similarities between said clusters and malignant nuclei, misclassification of these regions can affect the automated systems\u2019 final decision. In this paper, a method for differentiating clusters from multi nucleated cells in histopathological images is proposed. Hepatocellular Carcinoma(HCC) and Dysplasia are characterized by cellular and nuclear enlargement, nuclear pleomorphism and multinucleation, which possess prominent threat Data was obtained from Global Hospital and Research Center from patients diagnosed with Hepatocellular Carcinoma and Dysplasia. This paper introduces a hybrid diagnosis method that uses texture, layout and context features of nuclei and cytoplastic cells in order to enhance the poor diagnosis of liver tumors in Infra Red (IR) images. We propose a Area based Adaptive Expectation Maximization(EM) that grows the clusters, which avoids the need for initial cluster selection in order to obtain texton maps of nuclei and cytoplasm. A linear regression model of nuclei and cytoplastic changes were built by incorporating the aforementioned features efficiently. The proposed method provides better classification and segmentation accuracy of nuclei and extra nuclear content in HCC and dysplasia, compared to the state-of-the-art methods like convolutional networks and classical methods like Adaptive K means and EM method in constant time. In conclusion, this system detects the malignant cells and the highly eligible precancerous cells which is cost effective and reproducible.",

      "abstract": "Autonomous driving is predicated on the ability to measure a vehicle\u2019s position, velocity, attitude and the environment around it. This complex task requires a large and varied array of sensors as well as algorithms to exploit their measurements. A major component of this is absolute positioning. Two technologies in particular are heavily relied upon to deliver the absolute position: GNSS and inertial sensors. Current production vehicles already contain both GNSS and inertial sensors, but these are used (and are therefore specified) for functions such as infotainment and stability control. Performance needed for these functions is significantly below what is required for safe lane-level navigation. This means the current sensors, and therefore positioning capabilities, are unable to satisfy the more rigorous requirements needed for autonomy. Future vehicles will need to include more advanced versions of both sensors, along with corrections and advanced fusion techniques, all at a cost level that remains amenable to mass-production. This is a significant challenge facing mass market autonomous driving.\n\nThere are already many autonomous test vehicles on the roadways, though these provide mostly level 4 autonomy or lower [1], meaning they still require a human driver to be present and operate only in certain conditions. Additionally, these test vehicles are typically using sensors which are larger and more expensive than what is acceptable for mass production. The task of these test vehicles is to prove, and gain public acceptance of, the technology while mass marketable versions are developed.\n\nThis paper focuses on the absolute positioning component using GNSS and INS technologies. Specifically on the inertial fusion using currently achievable performance using mass market sensors. A companion paper: \u201cPrecise Positioning for Automotive with Mass Market GNSS Receivers,\u201d [2] focuses on GNSS capabilities.\n\nThe synergy between GNSS and INS has been well documented and is now widely used in growing industries such as mobile mapping. Noise inherent in GNSS positions can be smoothed by the continuous INS solution and at the same time, low frequency inertial errors are controlled by the GNSS. However, when GNSS is unavailable, the INS errors grow rapidly when unconstrained. The speed at which the INS errors grow is much larger when using lower-performance mass market sensors, making the task of mitigating these conditions more difficult for the fusion solution.\n\nClear trends can be seen in the results showing that the type of sensor has a significant impact on overall accuracy, but so too does the fusion technology used. The effects of this are apparent though modest in the suburban highway scenario, but are much larger in the more difficult urban canyon scenario.\n\nTo evaluate the achievable performance combining mass market sensors and NovAtel\u2019s SPAN inertial fusion technology, live data was collected and analyzed. These datasets were collected using different IMUs in two major scenarios; suburban highway and urban canyon. Additionally, a simplified loosely coupled inertial filter was run on the same data to evaluate the effect of the fusion algorithms on the resultant solution as final system performance depends on both the sensors and the integration. Results are compared against a post-processed solution using a survey grade dual frequency receiver paired with a navigation grade inertial measurement unit (IMU). Percentage of solutions with accuracy under the target of \u201clane level\u201d positioning will be examined in each environment.\n\nIt is clear in the results that autonomous highway driving can be very nearly achieved with GNSS and INS sensors alone, even with mass market sensors, when the right fusion technology is used. But in urban canyons, where GNSS satellites are often obstructed, or only visible via reflection, this is not the case. While sophisticated fusion technologies offer vast improvements, more development and likely more sensors will be required to meet the required accuracies at the extremely high confidence levels required for autonomy.",

      "abstract": "The U.S. Army Aviation Development Directorate, in collaboration with United Technologies Research Center and University of California: Santa Barbara, has developed a system for controlling multiple unmanned aerial systems (UAS) from a manned helicopter cockpit. Similar manned-unmanned teaming (MUM-T) capabilities have been successfully fielded in the AH-64E attack helicopter, with the Copilot/Gunner (CPG) managing one UAS; however, managing multiple UAS in the same manner would result in a cognitive processing bottleneck within the CPG. Removing this bottleneck requires implementation of autonomous behaviors and human-centered design principles to avoid detracting from the CPG\u2019s primary mission. This research evaluates these concepts with respect to multi-UAS MUM-T performance. Sixteen U.S. Army aviators with MUM-T experience participated in the experiment. The first phase assessed the performance of a CPG managing multiple UAS simultaneously in a fixed-base MUM-T simulator featuring touchscreen displays, simulated aided target recognition, and task-level delegation of control (DelCon). The second phase iteratively improved the DelCon capability and added an Attention Allocation Aid (AAA) in the form of real-time gaze tracking feedback. The research demonstrated that a single crewmember can manage at least three UAS assets while executing complex multi- UAS MUM-T tactical missions. The DelCon capability allowed participants to more efficiently perform a subset of mission tasks. Furthermore, subjective ratings from the participants indicated a willingness to accept the AAA and DelCon systems. Overall, this research demonstrates the potential of utilizing automation and human-centered design principles to overcome cognitive bottlenecks and achieve greater system efficiency.",

      "abstract": "The monitoring of vegetation near high-voltage transmission power lines and poles is tedious. Blackouts present a huge challenge to power distribution companies and often occur due to tree growth in hilly and rural areas. There are numerous methods of monitoring hazardous overgrowth that are expensive and time-consuming. Accurate estimation of tree and vegetation heights near power poles can prevent the disruption of power transmission in vulnerable zones. This paper presents a cost-effective approach based on a convolutional neural network (CNN) algorithm to compute the height (depth maps) of objects proximal to power poles and transmission lines. The proposed CNN extracts and classifies features by employing convolutional pooling inputs to fully connected data layers that capture prominent features from stereo image patches. Unmanned aerial vehicle or satellite stereo image datasets can thus provide a feasible and cost-effective approach that identifies threat levels based on height and distance estimations of hazardous vegetation and other objects. Results were compared with extant disparity map estimation techniques, such as graph cut, dynamic programming, belief propagation, and area-based methods. The proposed method achieved an accuracy rate of 90%.",

      "abstract": "For detection of a small target using electro-optical systems, multi-band 2D image sensors are used such as visible, NIR, MWIR, and LWIR. However, 2D imaging systems are not capable to detect a very small target and they are also not capable of calculating target 3D position coordinates to develop the strategic counter method. 3D sensors (e.g. Lidar, RGBD and stereo camera) are utilized to control unmanned vehicles for detecting threats and response for specific situations. Conventional Lidar systems are unable to detect small drone threat at distances higher than their maximum detecting range of 100 \u223c 120 meters. To overcome this limitation, laser radar (LADAR) systems are being developed, which allow the detection at distances up to 2 kilometers. In the development of LADAR, it is difficult to acquire datasets that contain cases of long distant targets. In this study, a fusion data generation with virtual targets technique based on minimum real LADAR initial map dataset is proposed, and precise small target detection method using voxel-based clustering and classification are studied. We present the process of data fusion generation and the experimental results for a small target detection. The presented approach also includes effective visualization of high-resolution 3D data and the results of small target detection in real time. This study is expected to contribute to the optimization of a drone threat detection system for various environments and characteristics.",

      "abstract": "Use of Global Navigation Satellite Systems (GNSS) in safety of life applications such as aircraft navigation, railway control and autonomous vehicles is increasing as these technologies become more necessary or mainstream. To serve these applications, GNSS must provide high integrity, even in the face of deliberate attacks such as spoofing. The Stanford dual polarization antenna (DPA) is a technology that uses a single patch antenna but with two feeds to examine both left and right hand circularly polarized (LHCP and RHCP, respectively) signals. Proper design and installation allows the DPA to use polarization of the incoming signal to determine direction of arrival (DOA) and elevation. These measures can be used to discriminate a genuine from a bogus broadcast. The technology can also null out some interference signals. \nThis paper examines the continued development and field tests of our DPA. Test with genuine on-air signals have shown the ability to determine DOA and elevation. Field test in on-air spoofing and jamming conditions were also conducted. These scenarios allow us to demonstrate the performance of the DPA processing, DOA and elevation estimates.",

      "abstract": "Technology has revolutionized human world over the past centuries. The world has started to move towards the autonomous world. However, in terms of security and safety of humans from antisocial threat person, technology has not achieved its peak in providing autonomous system. Places such as airport, railways stations, and malls are well secured either by metal detectors or by manual scrutiny. Moreover, the current scenario demands a very high security in common places such as hospital, schools, and community halls where manual security checks might not be possible. In this work an autonomous system is developed to detect and track concealed weapons with potential to stop the threat person before causing any harm or danger. The system achieves its task by carrying out three main functions in a sequential order. A microwave sensor and metal detector together detects the concealed weapon by means of the Doppler shift in the radiation and eddy currents induced in the metal respectively. Secondly, the output voltage from the microwave senor is processed by a microcontroller. Lastly, a DC motor attached with a laser pointer, receives input from microcontroller such that rotates in a direction pointing the concealed weapon.\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0",

Several challenges, including detection of pipes and other cylindrical elements in sensor space and validation of the elements detected, have been studied. A probabilistic parametric method has been applied to segment and position cylinders with LIDAR, while several vision-based techniques have been tested to find the contours of the pipe, combined with conic estimation cylinder pose recovery. Multiple solutions have been studied and analyzed, evaluating their results. This allowed proposing an approach that combines both LiDAR and vision to produce robust and accurate pipe detection. This combined solution is validated with real experimental data.",

This is a scenario with important military applications where each one of the agents is an autonomous air vehicle. Each agent plans and corrects its course of action in order to defeat an opposing force while simultaneously optimizing an operational relevant cost/payoff performance measure. The Target and the Defenders cooperate to form a team against the Attacker. The results in this paper build on the solution of a three agent differential game, where the three players are the Target, the Attacker, and one Defender; in this paper, the benefits of firing a second Defender are considered. Indeed, launching two interceptor missiles is a standard procedure by providing redundant backup. Building on the solution of the one-Defender problem, it is possible to address a seemingly intractable problem, where the Target needs to decide which Defender(s) to cooperate with, in addition to obtaining the optimal headings of every player in the game. Given the initial positions of the players, we solve the problem of determining if a second Defender improves the Target/Defender(s) payoff and provide the optimal strategies for each of the agents involved. Finally, we address the game of kind (for the case of one Defender) which provides the safety regions to determine which side will win based on the initial state. These safety regions provides the Target\u2019s area of vulnerability, and using these results, we describe the reduction to the Target\u2019s vulnerability area brought by an additional Defender.",

      "abstract": "Synthetic Aperture RADAR (SAR) is a radar imaging technique in which the relative motion of the sensor is used to synthesize a very long antenna and obtain high spatial resolution. The increasing interest of the scientific community to simplify SAR sensors and develop automatic system to quickly obtain a sufficiently good precision image is fostered by the will of developing low-cost/light-weight SAR systems to be carried by drones. Standard SAR raw data processing techniques assume uniform motion of the satellite (or aerial vehicle) and a fixed antenna beam pointing sideway orthogonally to the motion path, assumed rectilinear. In the same hypothesis, a novel blind data focusing technique is presented, able to obtain good quality images of the inspected area, in the presence of a strong point scatterer, without the use of ancillary data information. Despite SAR data processing is a well established imaging technology that has become fundamental in several fields and applications, in this paper a novel approach has been used to exploit coherent illumination, demonstrating the possibility of extracting a large part of the ancillary data information from the raw data itself, to be used in the focusing procedure. Preliminary results \u2013 still prone to enhancements \u2013 are presented for ERS raw data focusing. The proposed Matlab software is distributed under the Noncommercial \u2013 Share Alike 4.0 \u2013 International Creative Common license by the authors.",

A-VANET ensures timely and accurate communications between vehicle to vehicle and Vehicle to Roadside Unit (RSU) to improve road safety and enhance the efficiency of traffic flow. Due to open wireless boundary and high mobility, A-VANET is vulnerable to several security threats especially impersonation, denial of service, pollution attacks.  This paper presents a novel Received Signal Strength Indicator (RSSI) based public key infrastructure (PKI) to address the above-mentioned attacks. Each incoming signal will be authenticated based on RSSI value and digital signal (obtained using PKI) is utilized for cryptography and communication within the insecure channel. The proposed solution is verified with and without the presence of attacker by evaluating the packet delivery ratio and packet overhead.",

      "abstract": "The SWIR waveband between 0.8\u03bcm-1.8\u03bcm is getting increasingly exploited by imaging systems in a variety of different applications, including persistent imaging for security and surveillance of high-value assets, handheld tactical imagers, range-gated imaging systems and imaging LADAR for driverless vehicles. The vast majority of these applications utilize lattice-matched InGaAs detectors in their imaging sensors, and these sensors are rapidly falling in price, leading to their widening adoption. As these sensors are used in novel applications and locations, it is important that ambient SWIR backgrounds be understood and characterized for a variety of different field conditions, primarily for the purposes of system performance modeling of SNR and range metrics. SWIR irradiance backgrounds do not consistently track visible-light illumination at all. There is currently little of this type of information in the open literature, particularly measurements of SWIR backgrounds in urban areas, natural areas, or indoors. This paper presents field measurements done with an InGaAs detector calibrated in the swux unit of InGaAs-band-specific irradiance proposed by two of the authors in 2017. Simultaneous measurements of illuminance levels (in lux) at these sites are presented, as well as visible and InGaAs camera images of the scenery at some of these measurement sites. The swux and lux measurement hardware is described, along with the methods used to calibrate it. Finally, the swux levels during the partial and total phases of the total solar eclipse of 2017 are presented, along with curves fitted to the data from a theoretical model, based on obscuration of the sun by the moon. The apparent differences between photometric and swux measurements will be discussed.",

      "abstract": "Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) have the potential to substitute or support conventional methods for inspection and monitoring of natural or artificial structures in challenging scenarios. However, open challenges in the autonomous navigation and guidance remain if the Global Navigation Satellite Systems (GNSS) can not be employed because the reception of the signals is denied or unreliable. This often happens in cluttered natural environments, such as gorges and steep valleys, or near to tall civil engineering structures such as dams and bridges. In these cases, the position fix is intermittent, can be biased because of multi-path effects, and the change of the constellation of visible satellites can cause sudden, undesirable shifts in the position solution. In this work we propose a method to solve the position control of an UAV in such scenarios, exploiting the fact that open sky is available above the object of interest. The system is composed of two UAVs: the first one flies higher in the open sky, where an optimal GNSS constellation is available. The second one performs the close range inspection without relying on any GNSS receiver. Instead, its position is determined by the first one by optical tracking and it is sent to the second one in real-time and with low latency to close the position control loops. We present a detailed description of the system and discuss its first experimental evaluation.",

      "abstract": "Integrated motion planning and control for the purposes of maneuvering mobile robots under state- and input constraints is a problem of vital practical importance in applications of mobile robots such as autonomous transportation. Those constraints arise naturally in practice due to specifics of robot mechanical construction and the presence of obstacles in motion environment. In contrast to approaches focusing on feedback control design under the assumption of given reference motion or motion planning with neglection of subsequent feedback motion execution, we adopt a controller-driven motion planning paradigm, which has recently gained attention of many researchers. It postulates design of motion planning algorithms dedicated to specific feedback control policies, which compute a sequence of feedback control subtasks instead of classically planned open-loop controls or parametric paths. In this spirit, we propose a motion planning algorithm driven by the VFO (Vector Field Orientation) control law for the waypoint-following task. Presented analysis of the VFO control law reveals its beneficial properties, which are subsequently utilized to solve a generally nonlinear and non-convex optimal motion planning problem by formulating it as a mixed-integer linear program (MILP). The solution proposed in this paper yields a waypoint sequence, which is designed for execution by application of the VFO control law to drive a robot to a prescribed final configuration under an input constraint imposed by bounded curvature of robot motion and state constraints resulting from a convex decomposition of task space. Satisfaction of these constraints is guaranteed analytically and exactly, i.e., without utilization of numerical approximations. Moreover, for a given discrete set of possible waypoint orientations, the proposed algorithm computes plans optimal w.r.t. given cost functional, which can be any convex linear combination of quantities such as robot path length, curvature of robot motion, distance to imposed state constraints, etc. Furthermore, the planning algorithm exploits the possibility of both forward or backward movement of the robot to allow maneuvering in demanding environments. Generated waypoint sequences are a compact representation of a motion plan, which can be immediately executed with the VFO controller without any additional post-processing. Validity of the proposed approach has been confirmed by simulation studies and experimental motion execution with a laboratory-scale mobile robot.",

      "abstract": "Geographic information systems (GIS) provide accurate maps of terrain, roads, waterways, and building footprints and heights. Aircraft, particularly small unmanned aircraft systems (UAS), can exploit this and additional information such as building roof structure to improve navigation accuracy and safely perform contingency landings particularly in urban regions. However, building roof structure is not fully provided in maps. This paper proposes a method to automatically label building roof shape from publicly available GIS data. Satellite imagery and airborne LiDAR data are processed and manually labeled to create a diverse annotated roof image dataset for small to large urban cities. Multiple convolutional neural network (CNN) architectures are trained and tested, with the best performing networks providing a condensed feature set for support vector machine and decision tree classifiers. Satellite image and LiDAR data fusion is shown to provide greater classification accuracy than using either data type alone. Model confidence thresholds are adjusted leading to significant increases in models precision. Networks trained from roof data in Witten, Germany and Manhattan (New York City) are evaluated on independent data from these cities and Ann Arbor, Michigan.",

      "abstract": "In recent years, the Pterois Volitans, also known as the red lionfish, has become a serious threat by rapidly invading US coastal waters. Being a fierce predator, having no natural predator, being adaptive to different habitats, and being with high reproduction rates, the red lionfish has enervated current endeavors to control their population<i>.</i> This paper focuses on the first steps to reinforce these efforts by employing autonomous vehicles. To that end, an assistive underwater robotic scheme is designed to aid spear<b>-</b>hunting divers to locate and more efficiently hunt the lionfish. A small<b>-</b>sized, open source ROV with an integrated camera is programmed using Deep Learning methods to detect red lionfish in real time. Dives are restricted to a certain depth range, time, and air supply. The ROV program is designed to allow the divers to locate the red lionfish before each dive, so that they can plan their hunt to maximize their catch. Lightweight, portability, user<b>-</b>friendly interface, energy efficiency, and low cost of maintenance are some advantages of the proposed scheme. The developed system&#x2019;s performance is examined in areas currently invaded by the red lionfish in the Gulf of Mexico. The ROV has shown success in detecting the red lionfish with high confidence in real time.",

      "abstract": "Unmanned Aerial Systems UAS, i.e. drones, revolutionize the market for mobility based services and enable more efficient defence and security operations. Also this rapidly developing technology, however, proves to be Janus-faced. Despite their unquestionable benefits, UAS increasingly pose serious safety and security threats. Detection, tracking, and classification of small and highly agile drones, however, is one of the most challenging surveillance tasks. Only a properly designed suite of heterogeneous and mutually complementary sensor provides the required sensor data. On this basis, the key technology proves to advanced multiple sensor data fusion that provides situational awareness and the key information for assigning appropriate counter measures. We in particular focus on a novel approach and highly promising approach which has the potential of a paradigm shift in sensor data fusion: tensor decomposition based multiple sensor tracking filters. This new methodology for fusion engines is able to efficiently represent the full informational content of advanced sensors and sophisticated dynamic models for drone motion. Powerful multilinear decomposition methods for tensors are drastically reducing the computational efforts for producing high-quality tracks for dim and agile drones. Moreover, the deterministic performance characteristics of tensor decomposition based fusion have beneficial implications for systems design aspects. These advanced algorithms of multiple sensor data fusion play a key role in designing counter drone systems. In the context of C5ISR systems (Command, Control, Communications, Computer, Cyber, Intelligence, Surveillance and Reconnaissance), the technological challenges can be met, but require close cooperation between the military and police forces, research institutes and the relevant industries. In the protection of stationary equipment and mobile units in urban or open terrain, the integration of drone detection / tracking / classification in decision support systems is crucial.",

      "abstract": "The availability of miniaturized sensors with enhanced capabilities, new methods for image processing, and easy access to small and low-weight airborne platforms for data acquisition, including unmanned vehicles, opens new possibilities for geodetic navigation applications and developing new developments in sensor fusion. In this context, the development of efficient methods, based on low-cost sensors, to extract precise georeferenced information from digital cameras is of utmost interest. We present a method to improve the performance of the integration of GNSS/low-cost IMU by exploiting the orientation changes retrieved from digital images. In this work, a robust-adaptive Kalman filter is also introduced to further improve the performance of the method deployed. The adaptive factor and the robust factor accomplished are determined by innovation information and the threshold value of orientation changes between consecutive images. Results from airborne tests used to assess the performance of the method are presented. The results show that using a non-metric camera, the Euler angle estimation accuracy of the GNSS/low-cost IMU integration can be improved to be close to 0.5 degree and an additional improvement, which can reach 59%, can be achieved after using the robust-adaptive Kalman filter.",

      "abstract": "The number of affordable consumer unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) available on the market has been growing quickly in recent years. Uncontrolled use of such UAVs in the context of public events like sports events or demonstrations, as well as their use near sensitive areas, such as airports or correctional facilities pose a potential security threat. Automatic early detection of UAVs is thus an important task which can be addressed through multiple modalities, such as visual imagery, radar, audio signals, or UAV control signals. In this work we present an image processing pipeline which is capable of tracking very small point targets in an overview camera, adjusting a tilting unit with a mounted zoom camera (PTZ system) to locations of interest and classifying the spotted object in this more detailed camera view. The overview camera is a high-resolution camera with a wide field of view. Its main purpose is to monitor a wide area and to allow an early detection of candidates, whose motion or appearance warrant a closer investigation. In a subsequent process these candidates are prioritized and successively examined by adapting the orientation of the tilting unit and the zoom level of the attached camera lens, to be able to observe the target in detail and provide appropriate data for the classification stage. The image of the PTZ camera is then used to classify the object into either UAV class or distractor class. For this task we apply the popular SSD detector. Several parameters of the detector have been adapted for the task of UAV detection and classification. We demonstrate the performance of the full pipeline on imagery collected by the system. The data contains actual UAVs as well as distractors, such as birds.",

      "abstract": "Autonomous driving technology requires high accuracy and high integrity position and navigation. No individual technology can currently meet these requirements anywhere, anytime and under any condition. Sensor fusion is considered as the go-to-solution for the development of fully autonomous driving technology. GNSS is an element of a sensor fusion based navigation system that includes lidars/radars, inertial sensors and cameras. This work shows as the comparison between the speed\u2019s vehicle calculated by odometer and one estimated by GNSS receiver installed on board of train through Doppler is an effective means to face multipath in railway environment, even when just one receiver is available. Moreover, the georeferenced knowledge of the railway is not essential when Doppler are compared, while the pseudorange comparison requires a guess of the baseline between the receivers. Moreover, the proposed multipath detection and exclusion method is fully compatible with other techniques for multipath mitigation. The outcomes of this work, undertaken for railway scenarios, can be partly exploited in driver-less car applications thanks to the analogies between these two transportation sectors.",

      "abstract": "Autonomous unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) present an increasingly viable threat vector to the Defense com- munity. Existing response systems are vulnerable to saturation attacks of large swarms of low-cost autonomous vehicles. One method of reducing this threat is the use of an intelligent counter swarm with tactics, navigation and planning capabilities for engaging the adversarial swarm. Though previous studies exist that have produced libraries of basic fighter tactics employable by unmanned fixed-wing aircraft, we are aware of little prior work that explores close-in tactical engagements at a large scale (teams of at least size 10). We examine existing technologies that can be applied in fixed-wing swarm-versus-swarm engagement, including classic pursuit-evasion strategies and the application of Lanchester's laws for attrition calculations. Our recent studies center on lever- aging existing manned fighter combat doctrine, and on the benefits of collaboration. We consider experiments in close-air combat against adversaries capable of destroying aerial targets. The following work employs both a Monte Carlo analysis in a simulation environment to measure the effectiveness of several autonomous tactics, as well as an analysis of live flight experiments in swarm competitions with up to 10 vs. 10 scenarios.",

      "abstract": "Spotting a shooter from a drone has been the subject of great interest lately due to its many applications in the fields of defense and security and law enforcement. Using a drone can be an effective way to detect potential threats in many real-life scenarios. Nevertheless, acoustic signals recorded from a drone usually exhibit a very low SNR, mainly due to the distance to the source and the proximity of the sensors to the propellers. This is a serious limiting factor and, therefore, the use of signal enhancement techniques is required. This work addresses the problem of determining the Direction-of-Arrival (DoA) of the muzzle blast, captured using a planar microphone array mounted on a commercial DJI PHANTOM 4 drone in flight. This new shooter localization method that relies solely on detecting and estimating the DoA of the muzzle blast. However, the typical low SNR in this scenario requires the use of preprocessing techniques, such as signal clipping and median filtering, to enhance the signal of interest (muzzle blast). In addition, we employ a recently introduced improved data selection DoA estimation method suitable for gunshot signals recorded from a low to medium altitude mobile aerial platform. Positive results achieved indicate that this approach is effective and of practical interest.",

      "abstract": "The number of reported incidents caused by small UAVs, intentional as well as accidental, is rising. To avoid such incidents in future, it is essential to be able to detect UAVs. LiDAR sensors (e.g., laser scanners) are well known to be adequate sensors for object detection and tracking.<p>  </p> In this paper, we expand our existing LiDAR-based approach for the tracking and detection of (low) flying small objects like commercial mini/micro UAVs. We show that UAVs can be detected by the proposed methods, as long as the movements of the UAVs correspond to the LiDAR sensor\u2019s capabilities in scanning performance, range and resolution. The trajectory of the tracked object can further be analyzed to support the classification, meaning that UAVs and non- UAV objects can be distinguished by an identification of typical movement patterns. A stable tracking of the UAV is achieved by a precise prediction of its movement. In addition to this precise prediction of the target\u2019s position, the object detection, tracking and classification have to be achieved in real-time. <p>  </p>For the algorithm development and a performance analysis, we analyzed LiDAR data that we acquired during a field trial. Several different mini/micro UAVs were observed by a system of four 360\u00b0 LiDAR sensors mounted to a car. Using this specific sensor system, the results show that UAVs can be detected and tracked by the proposed methods, allowing a protection of the car against UAV threats within a radius of up to 35 m.",

      "abstract": "By exploiting the advanced information and communication technologies, the current community healthcare systems provide digital healthcare services. However, the current healthcare framework for senior citizen in outdoor environment faces new challenges. The traditional healthcare systems are not efficient, and they do not comprise user-friendly devices and interfaces suitable for the elderly in outdoor environment. Hence, in this work, we develop an outdoor healthcare system for community senior citizens based on unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) and Internet of things (IoT). Our system includes physical devices, wireless and wired networks, cloud and data center, and smart terminals. Further, the analysis of the proposed healthcare architecture is presented from the perspective of different layers, and an algorithm on UAV for creating high-speed communication channel and delivering medicine is provided. In addition, the healthcare UAV, related devices, and friendly APPs are designed. The proposed framework is evaluated by comparison with the current healthcare architecture. The emulating and experimental results show that our proposed system can provide a high-quality wireless communication link even at large communication distances, and in real testbed our proposal can reduce the response time by about 20&#x25; in comparison with the current methods.",

      "abstract": "Navigation of Autonomous Underwater Vehicles (AUVs) remains a challenge due to the impossibility to use radio frequency signals and Global Positioning System (GPS). Navigation systems usually integrate different proprioceptive sensors to estimate the asset and the speed of the vehicle. In particular, the Doppler Velocity Log (DVL) is fundamental during the navigation to have an accurate estimate of the vehicle\u2019s speed. This work addresses the enhancement of the navigation performance of an AUV through the development of a Deep Water Navigation Filter (DWNF). The DWNF is able to work in those scenarios where traditional navigation sensors show their limits: e.g., deep waters where DVL bottom lock cannot be achieved, or areas where the use of traditionally used static and dedicated beacons is incompatible with the mission requirements. The proposed approach exploits the concept of using a network of vehicles cooperatively supporting each other for their navigation. Several types of measurements coming from the different nodes (i.e. acoustic positioning system such as ship-mounted SSBL acoustic positioning system, USBL, range measurements from the different nodes) are fused in an Extended Kalman Filter framework with the odometry data. DWNF pushes forward the idea of using a network of robotic assets as a provider of navigation services allowing more flexible and robust operations of the deployed system. The approach has been tested at sea during several experiments. We report here results from DWNF running successfully in real-time on the NATO STO-Centre for Maritime Research and Experimentation (CMRE) vehicles during the Dynamic Mongoose\u201917 experimentation off the South coast of Iceland (June-July 2017).\u00a0",

      "abstract": "Teaching-learning-based optimization (TLBO) algorithm is a novel heuristic method which simulates the teaching-learning phenomenon of a classroom. However, in the later period of evolution of the TLBO algorithm, the lower exploitation ability and the smaller scope of solutions led to the poor results. To address this issue, this paper proposes a novel version of TLBO that is augmented with error correction strategy and Cauchy distribution (ECTLBO) in which Cauchy distribution is utilized to expand the searching space and error correction to avoid detours to achieve more accurate solutions. The experimental results verify that the ECTLBO algorithm has overall better performance than various versions of TLBO and is very competitive with respect to other nine original intelligence optimization algorithms. Finally, the ECTLBO algorithm is also applied to path planning of unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV), and the promising results show the applicability of the ECTLBO algorithm for problem-solving.",

      "abstract": "Global climate changes are a main factor of risk for infrastructures and people living along the coasts around the world. In this context, sea level rise, coastal retreat and storm surges pose serious threats to coastal zones. In order to assess the expected coastal changes for the next decades, a detailed knowledge of the site\u2019s topography (coastline position, DTM, bathymetry) is needed. This paper focuses on the use of very high resolution satellite data and UAV imagery for the generation of accurate very-high and ultra-high mapping of coastal areas. In addition, the use of very high resolution multi-spectral satellite data is investigated for the generation of coastal bathymetry maps. The paper presents a study for the island of Lipari and the coasts of Cinque Terre (Italy) and the island of Lefkas (Greece). For Lefkas, two areas of the island were mapped (the city of Lefkas and its adjoining lagoon in the north side of the island, and the Bay of Vasiliki at the south part of the island) using World View 1, and Wolrd View 3 satellite images, and UAV imagery. The satellite processing provided results that demonstrated an accuracy of approximately 0.25 m plannimetrically and 0.70 m vertically. The processing of the UAV imagery resulted in the generation of DTMs and orthophotos with an accuracy of approximately 0.03-0.04 meters. In addition, for the Vasiliki bay in the south of the island the World View 3 imagery was used for the estimation of a bathymetry map of the bay. The achieved results yielded an accuracy of 0.4 m. For the sites of Lipari and Cinque Terre (both in Italy), UAV surveys allowed to extract a DTM at about 2 cm of pixel resolution. The integration of topographic data with high resolution multibeam bathymetry and expected sea level rise from IPCC AR5 2.6 and 8.5 climatic scenarios, will be used to map sea level rise scenarios for 2050 and 2100, taking into account the Vertical Land Motion (VLM) as estimated from CGPS data. The above-mentioned study was realized during the implementation of the SAVEMEDCOASTS project (Sea level rise scenarios along the Mediterranean coasts, funded by the European Commission ECHO A.5, GA ECHO/SUB/2016/742473/PREV16, www.savemedcoasts.eu).",

      "abstract": "Dynamic path planning is one of the key procedures for unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV) to successfully fulfill the diversified missions. In this paper, we propose a new algorithm for path planning based on ant colony optimization (ACO) and artificial potential field. In the proposed algorithm, both dynamic threats and static obstacles are taken into account to generate an artificial field representing the environment for collision free path planning. To enhance the path searching efficiency, a coordinate transformation is applied to move the origin of the map to the starting point of the path and in line with the source-destination direction. Cost functions are established to represent the dynamically changing threats, and the cost value is considered as a scalar value of mobile threats which are vectors actually. In the process of searching for an optimal moving direction for UAV, the cost values of path, mobile threats, and total cost are optimized using ant optimization algorithm. The experimental results demonstrated the performance of the new proposed algorithm, which showed that a smoother planning path with the lowest cost for UAVs can be obtained through our algorithm.",

      "abstract": "GNSS are well known to be accurate providers of position information across the globe. Because of high signal availabilities, robust receivers, and well-populated constellations, operators typically believe that the location information provided by their GNSS receiver is correct. More sophisticated users are concerned with the integrity of the derived location information; for example, employ RAIM algorithms to address possible satellite failure modes.\n\nThe most common attacks on GNSS availability and integrity are known as jamming and spoofing. Jamming involves the transmission of signals that interfere with GNSS reception so that the receiver is unable to provide a position or time solution. Various methods to detect jamming, and possibly overcome it, have been considered in the literature. Spoofing is the transmission of counterfeit GNSS signals so as to mislead a GNSS receiver into reporting an inaccurate position or time. If undetected, spoofing might be much more dangerous than a jamming attack. A typical maritime concern is a spoofer convincing a tanker traveling up a channel to a harbor that it is off track of the channel.\n\nA variety of approaches have been proposed in the literature to recognize spoofing; many of these are based on the RF signal alone as, in some sense, they are the simplest to implement. Of interest here are methods which compare GNSS information to measurements available from other, non-GNSS sensors. Examined examples include IMUs, radars, and ranges/pseudoranges from non-GNSS signals. In all cases the data from these others sensors is compared to the position information from the GNSS receiver to assess its integrity. \n\nTriangulation of position from bearing measurements is a well-known localization technique, especially for the mariner. This paper considers the use of bearing information to detect GNSS spoofing in a 2-D environment. A typical marine application is a ship entering a harbor and using an alidade to sight landmarks; for mobile, autonomous vehicles the sensor might be a camera taking a bearing to a nearby vehicle or to a signpost. This paper presents a mathematical formulation of the problem and the sensor data, develops a statistical model of the measurements relative to the GNSS position output, constructs a generalized likelihood ratio test detection algorithm based on the Neyman-Pearson performance criterion (maximizing probability of detection while bounding the probability of false alarm), and examines performance of the test, both through analysis and experimentation. A comparison to using both range and bearing is included to show the utility and limitations of bearing data to spoof detection.",

      "abstract": "Conventional models of motor control exploit the spatial representation of the controlled system to generate control commands. Typically, the control command is gained with the feedback state of a specific instant in time, which behaves like an optimal regulator or spatial filter to the feedback state. Yet, recent neuroscience studies found that the motor network may constitute an autonomous dynamical system and the temporal patterns of the control command can be contained in the dynamics of the motor network, that is, the dynamical system hypothesis (DSH). Inspired by these findings, here we propose a computational model that incorporates this neural mechanism, in which the control command could be unfolded from a dynamical controller whose initial state is specified with the task parameters. The model is trained in a trial-and-error manner in the framework of deep deterministic policy gradient (DDPG). The experimental results show that the dynamical controller successfully learns the control policy for arm reaching movements, while the analysis of the internal activities of the dynamical controller provides the computational evidence to the DSH of the neural coding in motor cortices.",

      "abstract": "With the development of aviation industry around the world, unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) are broadly applied in modern warfare and civilian fields, which induces a big boom in the number of aircrafts, thus posing a great threat for flight security with the increasing aircraft density in the sky in the near future. Although current researches and methods can deal with the UAV safety problems well at some extent, the effectiveness of them is greatly reduced when the UAV is in a highly antagonism and harsh environment. In this work, the autonomous safety control method for the UAV system is researched and explored from the need of improving the operational security of UAV system. UAV safety control method based on cognition-guidance refers to that the UAV can rely on perceptual and cognitive computing functions of the UAV system during the flight guidance to perceive and identify the forthcoming or ongoing security risks and to generate a correct evasion strategy. Cognition-guidance is a specific application of the cognitive computing. The safety connotation of the UAV and the research status of safety control are firstly analyzed, then, the relationship between the guidance and human cognition is discussed, and the UAV safety control method based on cognition-guidance is proposed. Besides, the UAV anti-collision control strategy is designed, and taking the two UAVs anti-collision control mission as an example, the simulation research for the UAV safety control method based on cognition-guidance is studied. And the simulation results have proved that the method is effective.",

      "abstract": "Unmanned Aerial Systems (UASs) are becoming increasingly popular for amateur use, but their arbitrary deployment poses severe public safety threats to critical infrastructures, such as airports. Typically an Amateur Unmanned Aerial System (AUAS) communicates with a ground control station (GCS) through a telemetry radio, which keeps transmitting data in poor connection conditions. The accuracy of AUASs detection is of great significance. In this paper, we propose a novel surveillance framework which leverages Surveillance Unmanned Aerial Systems (SUASs) to detect AUASs. The approximate position of an AUAS is first estimated by Ground Surveillance Nodes (GSNs) with radio receivers, and SUASs are then activated to determine its precise position. Different from previous research, this framework not only leverages both ground and aerial surveillance capabilities, but also integrates both radio and image processing techniques, thus achieving enhanced AUAS detection capability. This platform has the potential to be integrated with other advanced technologies, providing the recognition of radio signals and imagery for a holistic solution of effective AUAS detection.",

      "abstract": "In this paper, a novel approach to solving the formation online collaborative trajectory planning for fixed-wing Unmanned Combat Aerial Vehicles (UCAVs) is proposed. In order to describe the problem, the formation attack process which consists of communication framework and synergy elements is analyzed. The collaborative trajectory planning model which is based on avoiding the threat zones, reducing the execution time, and accomplishing the mission combines kinematics/dynamics model of UCAV with formation relative motion model to establish the optimal control problem. The approach based on<i> hp</i> adaptive pseudospectral method is presented to generate formation trajectory that satisfies the collaborative constraints. When a trigger event is detected, based on the offline planning, the online collaborative trajectory replanning using rolling horizon strategy is carried out. Simulated experiments which are divided into offline scenarios and online scenarios demonstrate that the proposed approach can generate trajectories which can meet the actual flight constraints, and the results verify the feasibility and stability of the proposed approach.",

      "abstract": "<p>Malaria contributes to a major reason for the cause of fatality and serious health problems among children mainly in various parts of tropical Africa and Asia. The extraction of DNA plays a vital role in the diagnosis of this life-threatening parasite <i>Plasmodium</i>. Difficulties with existing extraction methods of DNA are increasing with time including detection limits, time duration, sensitivity, availability of chemicals, and cost. Consequently, there is now renewed interest in finding of novel methods for DNA extraction of <i>Plasmodium</i>. However, the extraction of DNA by using microwave irradiation is found to be most convenient and suitable due to its low-cost and usage of common chemical reagents especially for the children in poor resource settings. In addition, the low cost, noninvasive malaria diagnostics tests are needed to carry out particularly for children to avoid accidental infections which may happen due to drawing blood.</p>\n ",

      "abstract": "Regulations have allowed for increased unmanned aircraft systems (UAS) operations over the last decade, yet operations over people are still not permitted. The objective of this study was to estimate the range of injury risks to humans due to UAS impact. Three commercially-available UAS models that varied in mass (1.2\u201311&nbsp;kg) were evaluated to estimate the range of risk associated with UAS-human interaction. Live flight and falling impact tests were conducted using an instrumented Hybrid III test dummy. On average, live flight tests were observed to be less severe than falling impact tests. The maximum risk of AIS 3+ injury associated with live flight tests was 11.6%, while several falling impact tests estimated risks exceeding 50%. Risk of injury was observed to increase with increasing UAS mass, and the larger models tested are not safe for operations over people in their current form. However, there is likely a subset of smaller UAS models that are safe to operate over people. Further, designs which redirect the UAS away from the head or deform upon impact transfer less energy and generate lower risk. These data represent a necessary impact testing foundation for future UAS regulations on operations over people.",

      "abstract": "In the last decade, many approaches to automated service composition have been proposed. However, most of them do not fully exploit the opportunities offered by the Internet of Services (IoS). In this article, we focus on the dynamicity of the execution environment, that is, any change occurring at run-time that might affect the system, such as changes in service availability, service behavior, or characteristics of the execution context. We indicate that any IoS-based application strongly requires a composition framework that supports for the automation of all the phases of the composition life cycle, from requirements derivation, to synthesis, deployment and execution. Our solution to this ambitious problem is an AI planning-based composition framework that features abstract composition requirements and context-awareness. In the proposed approach most human-dependent tasks can be accomplished at design time and the few human intervention required at run time do not affect the system execution. To demonstrate our approach in action and evaluate it, we exploit the ASTRO-CAptEvo framework, simulating the operation of a fully automated IoS-based car logistics scenario in the Bremerhaven harbor.",

      "abstract": "<p>Increasing evidence indicates that reduced intracellular drug accumulation is the parameter most consistently associated with platinum drug resistance, emphasizing the need to directly measure the intratumor drug concentration. In the era of precision medicine and with the advent of powerful imaging and proteomics technologies, there is an opportunity to better understand drug resistance by exploiting these techniques to provide new knowledge on drug\u2013target interactions. Here, we contribute to this endeavor by reporting on the development of an <sup>18</sup>F-labeled carboplatin derivative (<sup>18</sup>F-FCP) that has the potential to image drug uptake and retention, including intratumoral distribution, by PET. <b>Methods:</b> Fluorinated carboplatin (<sup>19</sup>F-FCP) was synthesized using <sup>19</sup>F-labeled 2-(5-fluoro-pentyl)-2-methyl malonic acid (<sup>19</sup>F-FPMA) as the labeling agent to coordinate with the cisplatin\u2013aqua complex. It was then used to treat cell lines and compared with cisplatin and carboplatin at different concentrations. Manual radiosynthesis and characterization of <sup>18</sup>F-FCP were performed using <sup>18</sup>F-FPMA for coordination with the cisplatin\u2013aqua complex. Automated radiosynthesis of <sup>18</sup>F-FCP was optimized on the basis of manual synthesis procedures. The stability of <sup>18</sup>F-FCP was verified using high-performance liquid chromatography. <sup>18</sup>F-FCP was evaluated using ex vivo biodistribution and in vivo PET imaging in non\u2013tumor-bearing animals as well as in KB-3-1 and COLO-205 tumor xenograft\u2013bearing nude mice. <b>Results:</b> In vitro cytotoxicity studies demonstrated that <sup>19</sup>F-FCP has an antitumor activity profile similar to that of the parent drug carboplatin. In vivo plasma and urine stability analysis showed intact <sup>18</sup>F-FCP at 24 h after injection. PET imaging and biodistribution studies showed fast clearance from blood and major accumulation in the kidneys, indicating substantial renal clearance of <sup>18</sup>F-FCP. Using <sup>18</sup>F-FCP PET, we could image and identify the intratumor drug profile. <b>Conclusion:</b> Our results demonstrated that <sup>19</sup>F-FCP, like carboplatin, retains antitumor activity in various cell lines. <sup>18</sup>F-FCP could be a useful imaging tool for measuring the intratumor drug distribution. This strategy of using a new therapeutic carboplatin derivative to quantify and track platinum drugs in tumors using PET has the potential to translate into a clinically useful imaging tool for individual patients.</p>",

These studies also demonstrate the shift toward automated blood pressure measurements. We have reviewed these studies and others to put them in context with the guidelines that have come before and to describe how they will impact on hypertension treatment thresholds and targets, the treatment of hypertension in the elderly, and changing approaches to the management of hypertension including resistant hypertension.",

      "abstract": "In the last years, autonomous aerial vehicles have become promising mobile robotic platforms capable of manipulating external objects. In particular, quadrotors, rotorcrafts with four propellers, have been used for aerial transportation of cable-suspended loads. A critical step before transporting a payload is the lift maneuver. However, the analysis and planning of this maneuver have received a little attention in the literature so far. In this work, we decompose the cable-suspended load lifting into three simpler discrete states or modes: Setup, Pull, and Raise. Each of these states represents the dynamics of the quadrotor-load system at particular regimes during the maneuver. Furthermore, we define a hybrid system based on these states and show that it is a differentially-flat hybrid system. Exploiting this property, we generate a trajectory by using a series of waypoints associated with each mode. We design a nonlinear hybrid controller to track this trajectory and therefore execute the lift maneuver. We verify the proposed approach by carrying out experiments on an actual quadrotor with a cable-suspended load.",

      "abstract": "Indigenous territories are facing increasing pressures from numerous legal and illegal activities that are pushing commodity frontiers within their limits, frequently causing severe environmental degradation and threatening indigenous territorial rights and livelihoods. In Central and South America, after nearly three decades of participatory mapping projects, interest is mounting among indigenous peoples in the use of new technologies for community mapping and monitoring as a means of defense against such threats. Since 2014, several innovative projects have been developed and implemented in the region to demonstrate and train indigenous communities in the use of small drones for territorial mapping and monitoring. In this paper, we report on five projects carried out in Peru, Guyana, and Panama. For each one we describe the context, main objectives, positive outcomes, challenges faced, and opportunities ahead. Preliminary results are promising and have gained the interest of many indigenous societies who envision this technology as a powerful tool to protect their territories and strengthen their claims regarding specific environmental liabilities and justice issues. Based on the results presented here and a review of previous similar studies, we offer a critical discussion of some of the main opportunities and challenges that we foresee regarding the use of small drones for indigenous territorial mapping and monitoring. In addition, we elaborate on why a careful, well thought-out, and progressive adoption of drones by indigenous peoples may trigger grassroots innovations in ways conducive to greater environmental justice and sustainability.",

Five determinants of completion of AD were studied: familiarity with AD, source of information about AD, prior experiences with own life-threatening diseases or family members in need of care and motives in favour and against completion of AD.</p><h3>Design</h3>\n<p>Observational cross-sectional study.</p><h3>Setting</h3>\n<p>Private practices and a university clinic in Germany in 2012.</p><h3>Participants</h3>\n<p>649 outpatients from private practices and 2158 outpatients from 10 departments of a university clinic.</p><h3>Outcome measures</h3>\n<p>Completion of AD, familiarity with AD, sources of information about AD (consultation), prior experiences (with own life-threatening disease and family members in need of care), motives in favour of or against completion of AD, sociodemographic data.</p><h3>Results</h3>\n<p>Determinants of completion of AD did not differ between outpatients from private practices versus university clinic outpatients. Prior experience with severe disease led to a significantly higher rate of completion of AD (33%/36% with vs 24%/24% without prior experience). Participants with completion of AD had more often received legal than medical consultation before completion, but participants without completion of AD are rather aiming for medical consultation. The motives in favour of or against completion of AD indicated inconsistent patterns.</p><h3>Conclusions</h3>\n<p>Determinants of completion of AD are comparable in outpatients from private practices and outpatients from a university clinic. Generalisations from university clinic samples towards a broader context thus seem to be legitimate. Only one-third of patients with prior experience with own life-threatening diseases or family members in need of care had completed an AD as expression of their autonomous volition. The participants\u2019 motives for or against completion of AD indicate that ADs are considered a kind of \u2018negative autonomy\u2019 as instruments to prevent particular forms of therapy. Interactive, repeated and situation-based AD discussions might reach a higher percentage of patients and concurrently enable personal volitions and thereby strengthen individual \u2018positive autonomy\u2019.</p>",

      "abstract": "We solve a communication problem between a UAV and a set of receivers, in the presence of a jamming UAV, using differential game theory tools. We propose a new approach in which this kind of games can be approximated as pursuit-evasion games. The problem is posed in terms of optimizing capacity, and it is solved in two ways: firstly, a surrogate function approach is used to approximate it as a pursuit-evasion game; secondly, the game is solved without that approximation. In both cases, Isaacs equations are used to find the solution. Finally, both approaches are compared in terms of relative distance and complexity.",

      "abstract": "Microfluidic devices exploit combined physical, chemical and biological phenomena that could be unique in the sub-millimeter dimensions. The current goal of development of Point-of-Care (POC) medical devices is to extract the biomedical information from the blood. We examined the characteristics of blood flow in autonomous microfluidic devices with the aim to realize sensitive detection of interactions between particulate elements of the blood and the appropriately modified surfaces of the system. As a model experiment we demonstrated the fast analysis of the AB0 blood group system. We observed that the accumulation of red blood cells immobilized on the capillary wall leads to increased lateral movement of the flowing cells, resulting in the overall selective deceleration of the red blood cell flow column compared to the plasma fraction. We showed that by monitoring the flow rate characteristics in capillaries coated with blood type reagents it is possible to identify red blood cell types. Analysis of hydrodynamic effects governing blood flow by Finite Element Method based modelling supported our observations. Our proof-of-concept results point to a novel direction in blood analysis in autonomous microfluidic systems and also provide the basis for the construction of a simple quantitative device for blood group determination.",

Powerline dips at a random point are conventionally measured by the direct or indirect observation but it is not only unsafe but labor-intensive. Therefore in this study we applied the photogrammetric technique to remotely measure the powerline dips. Since it is not easy to extract conjugate points from linear powerlines, we exploited the epipolar lines acrossing the powerlines for 3D mapping of the powerlines and dip measurements. The vertical mapping accuracy estimated at two field-surveyed power line points was 15~16cm that are within 5% of deflection at the points and less than 3% of the powerline dip.",

      "abstract": "The problem of terrorist acts on railways has become more acute with the advent of high-speed trains. Terrorist acts and resulting wrecks of high-speed trains will have much more serious consequences than a conventional train crash. Analysis of the capabilities of technical security systems applied to counter-terrorist protection of high-speed trains shows that there is no protection against drone terrorist attacks committed by bomb-carrying drones. Simultaneously, the special services of MI5 (United Kingdom) and the FSB (Russian Federation) have revealed information that international terrorist organizations, such as ISIS (Islamic State of Iraq and Greater Syria), are actively investigating the possibilities of employing bomb-carrying drones as a terrorist tool. The aim of this study is to investigate the problem of protection of high speed trains against terrorist acts accomplished by such new terrorist tools as bomb-carrying unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV), commonly known as drones. To resolve the problem, we have developed a system for protecting high-speed trains against unmanned aerial vehicles. The operative principle of this system is based on the suppression of radio channels controlling drones. Radio channels controlling drones can be suppressed by radio interference generated by a technical security system. Such a system can be applied to the protection of high speed trains operating in France, Japan, Russia, China, the USA and other countries against terrorist attacks by bomb-carrying unmanned aerial vehicles.",

      "abstract": "Introduction Many biological structures show recurring tiling patterns on one structural level or the other. Current image acquisition techniques are able to resolve those tiling patterns to allow quantitative analyses. The resulting image data, however, may contain an enormous number of elements. This renders manual image analysis infeasible, in particular when statistical analysis is to be conducted, requiring a larger number of image data to be analyzed. As a consequence, the analysis process needs to be automated to a large degree. In this paper, we describe a multi-step image segmentation pipeline for the automated segmentation of the calcified cartilage into individual tesserae from computed tomography images of skeletal elements of stingrays.   Methods Besides applying state-of-the-art algorithms like anisotropic diffusion smoothing, local thresholding for foreground segmentation, distance map calculation, and hierarchical watershed, we exploit a graph-based representation for fast correction of the segmentation. In addition, we propose a new distance map that is computed only in the plane that locally best approximates the calcified cartilage. This distance map drastically improves the separation of individual tesserae. We apply our segmentation pipeline to hyomandibulae from three individuals of the round stingray (Urobatis halleri), varying both in age and size.   Results Each of the hyomandibula datasets contains approximately 3000 tesserae. To evaluate the quality of the automated segmentation, four expert users manually generated ground truth segmentations of small parts of one hyomandibula. These ground truth segmentations allowed us to compare the segmentation quality w.r.t. individual tesserae. Additionally, to investigate the segmentation quality of whole skeletal elements, landmarks were manually placed on all tesserae and their positions were then compared to the segmented tesserae. With the proposed segmentation pipeline, we sped up the processing of a single skeletal element from days or weeks to a few hours.",

      "abstract": "Driven by technological advances and economic gain, society\u2019s electronic systems are becoming larger, faster, more decentralized and autonomous, and yet with increasing global reach. A prime example are the networks of financial markets which\u2014in contrast to popular perception\u2014are largely all-electronic and decentralized with no top-down real-time controller. This prototypical system generates complex subsecond dynamics that emerge from a decentralized network comprising heterogeneous hardware and software components, communications links, and a diverse ecology of trading algorithms that operate and compete within this all-electronics environment. Indeed, these same technological and economic drivers are likely to generate a similarly competitive all-electronic ecology in a variety of future cyberphysical domains such as e-commerce, defense and the transportation system, including the likely appearance of large numbers of autonomous vehicles on the streets of many cities. Hence there is an urgent need to deepen our understanding of stability, safety and security across a wide range of ultrafast, large, decentralized all-electronic systems\u2014in short, society will eventually need to understand what extreme behaviors can occur, why, and what might be the impact of both intentional and unintentional system perturbations. Here we set out a framework for addressing this issue, using a generic model of heterogeneous, adaptive, autonomous components where each has a realistic limit on the amount of information and processing power available to it. We focus on the specific impact of delayed information, possibly through an accidental shift in the latency of information transmission, or an intentional attack from the outside. While much remains to be done in terms of developing formal mathematical results for this system, our preliminary results indicate the type of impact that can occur and the structure of a mathematical theory which may eventually describe it.",

In this study, with the objective of enhancing the rotor performance of agricultural unmanned helicopters, the performance of basic airfoils was evaluated in a wind tunnel and via computational fluid dynamics simulation. The lift and power characteristics of rotor blades were also evaluated. As airfoil design steps to improve the lift of unmanned helicopter, the characteristics of lift, drag, and power were analyzed via wind tunnel tests for the 400 mm section models of two airfoils, specifically a thick airfoil (V1505A) with blunt nose and a thin airfoil (V2008B) with drooping nose. The V1505A airfoil is appropriate for the inboard region, which requires stable aerodynamics at a high angle of attack. On the other hand, the V2008B airfoil is ideal for the outboard region of the rotor because it has a relatively high dynamic efficiency. Therefore, it is expected that a transitional airfoil blade with a negative twist angle can solve the problems of unmanned aerial pesticide application.",

      "abstract": "<p><strong class=\"journal-contentHeaderColor\">Abstract.</strong> Within coastal systems, sand dunes are the only natural barriers able to counteract erosive processes. Since their equilibrium is often threatened by human activities and high vulnerability of the coastal environment, dunes require increasing attention and specific monitoring. Located between the mainland and the sea, dunes are unique residue habitats for some plant and animal species. In particular, their vegetation is important because it has a consolidation function and promotes the vertical dune accretion. A georeferenced vegetation classification can be useful to define the advancements or erosion stage of the dune, usually based only on the geometric reconstruction. <br><br> The proposed study aims to compare the classifications performed with some combinations of two of the last generation sensors and traditional image processing techniques. High spectral resolution satellite image (WorldView-2) and a multispectral orthophoto, obtained from data acquired by an unmanned aerial vehicle, were used. Objects and pixel algorithms were applied and the results were compared by a statistical test. Using the same bands, the findings show that both data are suitable for monitoring the evolutionary dune status. Specifically, the WorldView-2 pixel-based classification and UAV object-based classification provide the same accurate results.</p>",

      "abstract": "\n                           Ehrlichia ruminantium is the causal agent of heartwater, a fatal tropical disease affecting ruminants with important economic impacts. This bacterium is transmitted by Amblyomma ticks and is present in sub-Saharan Africa, islands in the Indian Ocean and the Caribbean, where it represents a threat to the American mainland. An automated DNA extraction method was adapted for Amblyomma ticks and a new qPCR targeting the pCS20 region was developed to improve E. ruminantium screening capacity and diagnosis. The first step in the preparation of tick samples, before extraction, was not automated but was considerably improved by using a Tissue Lyser. The new pCS20 Sol1 qPCR and a previously published pCS20 Cow qPCR were evaluated with the OIE standard pCS20 nested PCR. \n                           pCS20 Sol1 qPCR was found to be more specific than the nested PCR, with a 5-fold increase in sensitivity (3 copies/reaction vs 15 copies/reaction), was less prone to contamination and less time-consuming. As pCS20 Sol1 qPCR did not detect Rickettsia, Anasplasma and Babesia species or closely related species such as Panola Mountain Ehrlichia, E. chaffeensis and E. canis, its specificity was also better than Cow qPCR. In parallel, a tick 16S qPCR was developed for the quality control of DNA extraction that confirmed the good reproducibility of the automated extraction. The whole method, including the automated DNA extraction and pCS20 Sol1 qPCR, was shown to be sensitive, specific and highly reproducible with the same limit of detection as the combined manual DNA extraction and nested PCR, i.e. 6 copies/reaction. Finally, 96 samples can be tested in one day compared to the four days required for manual DNA extraction and nested PCR. The adaptation of an automated DNA extraction using a DNA/RNA viral extraction kit for tick samples and the development of a new qPCR increased the accuracy of E. ruminantium epidemiological studies, as well as the diagnostic capabilities and turn-over time for surveillance of heartwater. This new method paves the way for large-scale screening of other bacteria and viruses in ticks as well as genetic characterization of ticks and tick-pathogen coevolution studies.",

      "abstract": "In search and rescue activities, unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV) should exploit sound information to compensate for poor visual information. This paper describes the design and implementation of a UAV-embedded microphone array system for sound source localization in outdoor environments. Four critical development problems included water-resistance of the microphone array, efficiency in assembling, reliability of wireless communication, and sufficiency of visualization tools for operators. To solve these problems, we developed a spherical microphone array system (SMAS) consisting of a microphone array, a stable wireless network communication system, and intuitive visualization tools. The performance of SMAS was evaluated with simulated data and a demonstration in the field. Results confirmed that the SMAS provides highly accurate localization, water resistance, prompt assembly, stable wireless communication, and intuitive information for observers and operators.",

      "abstract": "The development of innovative targeted therapeutic approaches are expected to surpass the efficacy of current forms of treatments and cause less damage to healthy cells surrounding the tumor site. Since the first development of targeting agents from hybridoma\u2019s, monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) have been employed to inhibit tumor growth and proliferation directly or to deliver effector molecules to tumor cells. However, the full potential of such a delivery strategy is hampered by the size of mAbs, which will obstruct the targeted delivery system to access the tumor tissue. By serendipity, a new kind of functional homodimeric antibody format was discovered in camelidae, known as heavy-chain antibodies (HCAbs). The cloning of the variable domain of HCAbs produces an attractive minimal-sized alternative for mAbs, referred to as VHH or nanobodies (Nbs). Apart from their dimensions in the single digit nm range, the unique characteristics of Nbs combine a high stability and solubility, low immunogenicity and excellent affinity and specificity against all possible targets including tumor markers. This stimulated the development of tumor targeted therapeutic strategies. Some autonomous Nbs have been shown to act as antagonistic drugs, but more importantly, the targeting capacity of Nbs has been exploited to create drug delivery systems. Obviously, Nb-based targeted cancer therapy is mainly focused towards extracellular tumor markers, since the membrane barrier prevents antibodies to reach the most promising intracellular tumor markers. Potential strategies, such as lentiviral vectors and bacterial Type 3 Secretion System, are proposed to deliver target-specific Nbs into tumor cells and to block tumor markers intracellularly. Simultaneously, Nbs have also been employed for in vivo molecular imaging to diagnose diseased tissues and to monitor the treatment effects. Here we review the state of the art and focus on recent developments with Nbs as targeting moieties for drug delivery systems in cancer therapy and cancer imaging.",

      "abstract": "The core principles of the evolutionary theories of emotions declare that affective states represent crucial drives for action selection in the environment and regulated the behavior and adaptation of natural agents in ancestrally recurrent situations. While many different studies used autonomous artificial agents to simulate emotional responses and the way these patterns can affect decision-making, few are the approaches that tried to analyze the evolutionary emergence of affective behaviors directly from the specific adaptive problems posed by the ancestral environment. A model of the evolution of affective behaviors is presented using simulated artificial agents equipped with neural networks and physically inspired on the architecture of the iCub humanoid robot. We use genetic algorithms to train populations of virtual robots across generations, and investigate the spontaneous emergence of basic emotional behaviors in different experimental conditions. In particular, we focus on studying the emotion of fear, therefore the environment explored by the artificial agents can contain stimuli that are safe or dangerous to pick. The simulated task is based on classical conditioning and the agents are asked to learn a strategy to recognize whether the environment is safe or represents a threat to their lives and select the correct action to perform in absence of any visual cues. The simulated agents have special input units in their neural structure whose activation keep track of their actual \u201csensations\u201d based on the outcome of past behavior. We train five different neural network architectures and then test the best ranked individuals comparing their performances and analyzing the unit activations in each individual\u2019s life cycle. We show that the agents, regardless of the presence of recurrent connections, spontaneously evolved the ability to cope with potentially dangerous environment by collecting information about the environment and then switching their behavior to a genetically selected pattern in order to maximize the possible reward. We also prove the determinant presence of an internal time perception unit for the robots to achieve the highest performance and survivability across all conditions.",

      "abstract": "Background: Especially for single older adults with chronic diseases, physical inactivity and a poor social network are regarded as serious threats to their health and independence. The Active Plus intervention is an automated computer-tailored eHealth intervention that has been proven effective to promote physical activity (PA) in the general population of adults older than 50 years. Objective: The aim of this study was to report on the methods and results of the systematic adaptation of Active Plus to the wishes and needs of the subgroup of single people older than 65 years who have one or more chronic diseases, as this specific target population may encounter specific challenges regarding PA and social network. Methods: The Intervention Mapping (IM) protocol was used to systematically adapt the existing intervention to optimally suit this specific target population. A literature study was performed, and quantitative as well as qualitative data were derived from health care professionals (by questionnaires, n=10) and the target population (by focus group interviews, n=14), which were then systematically integrated into the adapted intervention. Results: As the health problems and the targeted behavior are largely the same in the original and adapted intervention, the outcome of the needs assessment was that the performance objectives remained the same. As found in the literature study and in data derived from health professionals and focus groups, the relative importance and operationalization of the relevant psychosocial determinants related to these objectives are different from the original intervention, resulting in a refinement of the change objectives to optimally fit the specific target population. This refinement also resulted in changes in the practical applications, program components, intervention materials, and the evaluation and implementation strategy for the subgroup of single, chronically impaired older adults. Conclusions: This study demonstrates that the adaptation of an existing intervention is an intensive process in which adopting the IM protocol is an invaluable tool. The study provides a broad insight in adapting interventions aimed at single older adults with a chronic disease. It is concluded that even when the new target population is a sizable segment of the original target population, the adapted intervention still needs considerable changes to optimally fit the needs and situational differences of the narrower target population.

      "abstract": "Visual methods have many applications in mobile robotics problems, such as localization, navigation, and mapping. Some methods require that the robot moves in a plane without tilting. This planar-motion assumption simplifies the problem, and can lead to improved results. However, tilting the robot violates this assumption, and may cause planar-motion methods to fail. Such a tilt should therefore be corrected. In this work, we estimate a robot\u2019s tilt relative to a ground plane from individual panoramic images. This estimate is based on the vanishing point of vertical elements, which commonly occur in indoor environments. We test the quality of two methods on images from several environments: An image-space method exploits several approximations to detect the vanishing point in a panoramic fisheye image. The vector-consensus method uses a calibrated camera model to solve the tilt-estimation problem in 3D space. In addition, we measure the time required on desktop and embedded systems. We previously studied visual pose-estimation for a domestic robot, including the effect of tilts. We use these earlier results to establish meaningful standards for the estimation error and time. Overall, we find the methods to be accurate and fast enough for real-time use on embedded systems. However, the tilt-estimation error increases markedly in environments containing relatively few vertical edges.",

      "abstract": "To improve the quality of service and reduce the possibility of security attacks, a secure and efficient user authentication mechanism is required for Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs) and the Internet of Things (IoT). Session key establishment between the sensor node and the user is also required for secure communication. In this paper, we perform the security analysis of A.K.Das\u2019s user authentication scheme (given in 2015), Choi et al.\u2019s scheme (given in 2016), and Park et al.\u2019s scheme (given in 2016). The security analysis shows that their schemes are vulnerable to various attacks like user impersonation attack, sensor node impersonation attack and attacks based on legitimate users. Based on the cryptanalysis of these existing protocols, we propose a secure and efficient authenticated session key establishment protocol which ensures various security features and overcomes the drawbacks of existing protocols. The formal and informal security analysis indicates that the proposed protocol withstands the various security vulnerabilities involved in WSNs. The automated validation using AVISPA and Scyther tool ensures the absence of security attacks in our scheme. The logical verification using the Burrows-Abadi-Needham (BAN) logic confirms the correctness of the proposed protocol. Finally, the comparative analysis based on computational overhead and security features of other existing protocol indicate that the proposed user authentication system is secure and efficient. In future, we intend to implement the proposed protocol in real-world applications of WSNs and IoT.",

      "abstract": "Landslides are major and constantly changing threats to urban landscapes and infrastructure. It is essential to detect and capture landslide changes regularly. Traditional methods for monitoring landslides are time-consuming, costly, dangerous, and the quality and quantity of the data is sometimes unable to meet the necessary requirements of geotechnical projects. This motivates the development of more automatic and efficient remote sensing approaches for landslide progression evaluation. Automatic change detection involving low-altitude unmanned aerial vehicle image-based point clouds, although proven, is relatively unexplored, and little research has been done in terms of accounting for volumetric changes. In this study, a methodology for automatically deriving change displacement rates, in a horizontal direction based on comparisons between extracted landslide scarps from multiple time periods, has been developed. Compared with the iterative closest projected point (ICPP) registration method, the developed method takes full advantage of automated geometric measuring, leading to fast processing. The proposed approach easily processes a large number of images from different epochs and enables the creation of registered image-based point clouds without the use of extensive ground control point information or further processing such as interpretation and image correlation. The produced results are promising for use in the field of landslide research.",

      "abstract": "Autonomous driving in public roads requires precise localization within the range of few centimeters. Even the best current precise localization system based on the Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) can not always reach this level of precision, especially in an urban environment, where the signal is disturbed by surrounding buildings and artifacts. Laser range finder and stereo vision have been successfully used for obstacle detection, mapping and localization to solve the autonomous driving problem. Unfortunately, Light Detection and Ranging (LIDARs) are very expensive sensors and stereo vision requires powerful dedicated hardware to process the cameras information. In this context, this article presents a low-cost architecture of sensors and data fusion algorithm capable of autonomous driving in narrow two-way roads. Our approach exploits a combination of a short-range visual lane marking detector and a dead reckoning system to build a long and precise perception of the lane markings in the vehicle\u2019s backwards. This information is used to localize the vehicle in a map, that also contains the reference trajectory for autonomous driving. Experimental results show the successful application of the proposed system on a real autonomous driving situation.",

      "abstract": "The endurance of an aircraft can be considerably extended by its exploitation of the hidden energy of a wind gradient, as an albatross does. The process is referred to as dynamic soaring and there are two methods for its implementation, namely, sustainable climbing and the Rayleigh cycle. In this study, the criterion for sustainable climbing was determined, and a bio-inspired method for implementing the Rayleigh cycle in a shear wind was developed. The determined sustainable climbing criterion promises to facilitate the development of an unpowered aircraft and the choice of a more appropriate soaring environment, as was demonstrated in this study. The criterion consists of three factors, namely, the environment, aerodynamics, and wing loading. We develop an intuitive explanation of the Raleigh cycle and analyze the energy mechanics of utilizing a wind gradient in unpowered flight. The energy harvest boundary and extreme power point were determined and used to design a simple bio-inspired guidance strategy for implementing the Rayleigh cycle. The proposed strategy, which involves the tuning of a single parameter, can be easily implemented in real-time applications. In the results and discussions, the effects of each factor on climbing performance are examined and the sensitivity of the aircraft factor is discussed using five examples. Experimental MATLAB simulations of the proposed strategy and the comparison of the results with those of Gauss Pseudospectral Optimization Software confirm the feasibility of the proposed strategy.",

      "abstract": "This paper focuses on real-world implementation and verification of a local, model-based stochastic automatic collision avoidance algorithm, with application in remotely-piloted (tele-operated) unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs). Automatic collision detection and avoidance for tele-operated UAVs can reduce the workload of pilots to allow them to focus on the task at hand, such as searching for victims in a search and rescue scenario following a natural disaster. The proposed algorithm takes the pilot\u2019s input and exploits the robot\u2019s dynamics to predict the robot\u2019s trajectory for determining whether a collision will occur. Using on-board sensors for obstacle detection, if a collision is imminent, the algorithm modifies the pilot\u2019s input to avoid the collision while attempting to maintain the pilot\u2019s intent. The algorithm is implemented using a low-cost on-board computer, flight-control system, and a two-dimensional laser illuminated detection and ranging sensor for obstacle detection along the trajectory of the robot. The sensor data is processed using a split-and-merge segmentation algorithm and an approximate Minkowski difference. Results from flight tests demonstrate the algorithm\u2019s capabilities for tele-operated collision-free control of an experimental UAV.",

      "abstract": "Internet of Things has drastically expanded the global network for information exchange, because thousands of communication devices are becoming part of the global network. Besides the numerous benefits of global network expansion, secure communication and authentication among the comprising elements of the global network is also posing great challenges. Recently, Huang et al. proposed a key agreement scheme in order to facilitate user authenticity using elliptic curve cryptography. Huang et al. further emphasized the scheme is secure. Nevertheless, comprehensive analysis in this paper, demonstrates that Huang et al. scheme has correctness issues and is prone to impersonation/forgery attack. Then an improved scheme is presented to tenacity the said glitches existent in Huang et al.\u2019s scheme. The security analysis of proposed scheme is substantiated in random oracle model. Furthermore, a simulation of proposed scheme is carried out by automated formal tool ProVerif. The performance and security assessments show that the scheme presented in this paper withstand impersonation attack and offers adequate security while reducing significant computation cost as compared with Huang et al.\u2019s scheme. Hence, due to better performance and security, the proposed scheme is the appropriate one for security sensitive and resource constrained environments.",

      "abstract": "User\u2019s password with smart card based authentication protocol is needed to access resources securely from remote server. In 2014, Huang et al. proposed a timestamp-based authentication protocol and they claimed that their scheme is secure against all possible attacks. In this paper, we have pointed out that Huang et al.\u2019s scheme is insecure against off-line password guessing attack, insider attack and forgery attack. Beside these, inefficient password update phase can lead to denial of service. To remove these security loopholes, we have proposed an efficient RSA-cryptosystem based remote user authentication scheme using smart card. Security (formal and informal) analysis shows that the proposed scheme provides better security tradeoff than Huang et al.\u2019s scheme. Further, we have simulated our proposed scheme for the formal security verification using Automated Validation of Internet Security Protocols and Applications tool to confirm that the proposed scheme is secure against passive and active attacks. Performance analysis shows that the proposed scheme provides lower computational and communication cost than Huang et al.\u2019s scheme as well as other related competitive existing schemes.",

      "abstract": "The loss of unimproved grassland has led to species decline in a wide range of taxonomic groups. Agricultural intensification has resulted in fragmented patches of remnant grassland habitat both across Europe and internationally. The monitoring of remnant patches of this habitat is critically important, however, traditional surveying of large, remote landscapes is a notoriously costly and difficult task. The emergence of small-Unmanned Aircraft Systems (sUAS) equipped with low-cost multi-spectral cameras offer an alternative to traditional grassland survey methods, and have the potential to progress and innovate the monitoring and future conservation of this habitat globally. The aim of this article is to investigate the potential of sUAS for rapid detection of threatened unimproved grassland and to test the use of an Enhanced Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (ENDVI). A sUAS aerial survey is undertaken at a site nationally recognised as an important location for fragmented unimproved mesotrophic grassland, within the south east of England, UK. A multispectral camera is used to capture imagery in the visible and near-infrared spectrums, and the ENDVI calculated and its discrimination performance compared to a range of more traditional vegetation indices. In order to validate the results of analysis, ground quadrat surveys were carried out to determine the grassland communities present. Quadrat surveys identified three community types within the site; unimproved grassland, improved grassland and rush pasture. All six vegetation indices tested were able to distinguish between the broad habitat types of grassland and rush pasture; whilst only three could differentiate vegetation at a community level. The Enhanced Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (ENDVI) was the most effective index when differentiating grasslands at the community level. The mechanisms behind the improved performance of the ENDVI are discussed and recommendations are made for areas of future research and study.",

      "abstract": "3D urban maps with semantic labels and metric information are not only essential for the next generation robots such autonomous vehicles and city drones, but also help to visualize and augment local environment in mobile user applications. The machine vision challenge is to generate accurate urban maps from existing data with minimal manual annotation. In this work, we propose a novel methodology that takes GPS registered LiDAR (Light Detection And Ranging) point clouds and street view images as inputs and creates semantic labels for the 3D points clouds using a hybrid of rule-based parsing and learning-based labelling that combine point cloud and photometric features. The rule-based parsing boosts segmentation of simple and large structures such as street surfaces and building facades that span almost 75% of the point cloud data. For more complex structures, such as cars, trees and pedestrians, we adopt boosted decision trees that exploit both structure (LiDAR) and photometric (street view) features. We provide qualitative examples of our methodology in 3D visualization where we construct parametric graphical models from labelled data and in 2D image segmentation where 3D labels are back projected to the street view images. In quantitative evaluation we report classification accuracy and computing times and compare results to competing methods with three popular databases: NAVTEQ True, Paris-Rue-Madame and TLS (terrestrial laser scanned) Velodyne.",

      "abstract": "A physical model for a micro air vehicle with Flapping Rotary Wings (FRW) is investigated by measuring the wing kinematics in trim conditions and computing the corresponding aerodynamic force using computational fluid dynamics. In order to capture the motion image and reconstruct the positions and orientations of the wing, the photogrammetric method is adopted and a method for automated recognition of the marked points is developed. The characteristics of the realistic wing kinematics are presented. The results show that the non-dimensional rotating speed is a linear function of non-dimensional flapping frequency regardless of the initial angles of attack. Moreover, the effects of wing kinematics on aerodynamic force production and the underlying mechanism are analyzed. The results show that the wing passive pitching caused by elastic deformation can significantly enhance lift production. The Strouhal number of the FRW is much higher than that of general flapping wings, indicating the stronger unsteadiness of flows in FRW.",

      "abstract": "Shape formation is a basic distributed problem for systems of computational mobile entities. Intensively studied for systems of autonomous mobile robots, it has recently been investigated in the realm of programmable matter. Namely, it has been studied in the geometric Amoebot model, where the anonymous entities, called particles, operate on a hexagonal tessellation of the plane, have constant memory, can only communicate with neighboring particles, and can only move from a grid node to an empty neighboring node; their activation is controlled by an adversarial scheduler. Recent investigations have shown how, starting from a well-structured configuration in which the particles form a (not necessarily complete) triangle, the particles can form a large class of shapes. This result has been established under several assumptions: agreement on the clockwise direction (i.e., chirality), a sequential activation schedule, and randomization.\r\n\r\nIn this paper we provide a characterization of which shapes can be formed deterministically starting from any simply connected initial configuration of n particles. As a byproduct, if randomization is allowed, then any input shape can be formed from any initial (simply connected) shape by our algorithm, provided that n is large enough. Our algorithm works without chirality, proving that chirality is computationally irrelevant for shape formation. Furthermore, it works under a strong adversarial scheduler, not necessarily sequential. We also consider the complexity of shape formation both in terms of the number of rounds and the total number of moves performed by the particles executing a universal shape formation algorithm. We prove that our solution has a complexity of O(n^2) rounds and moves: this number of moves is also asymptotically optimal.",

      "abstract": "<p><strong class=\"journal-contentHeaderColor\">Abstract.</strong> Nowadays, lidar is widely used in cultural heritage documentation, urban modeling, and driverless car technology for its fast and accurate 3D scanning ability. However, full exploitation of the potential of point cloud data for efficient and automatic object recognition remains elusive. Recently, feature-based methods have become very popular in object recognition on account of their good performance in capturing object details. Compared with global features describing the whole shape of the object, local features recording the fractional details are more discriminative and are applicable for object classes with considerable similarity. In this paper, we propose a two-step classification approach based on point feature histograms and the bag-of-features method for automatic recognition of similar objects in mobile lidar point clouds. Lamp post, street light and traffic sign are grouped as one category in the first-step classification for their inter similarity compared with tree and vehicle. A finer classification of the lamp post, street light and traffic sign based on the result of the first-step classification is implemented in the second step. The proposed two-step classification approach is shown to yield a considerable improvement over the conventional one-step classification approach.</p>",

      "abstract": "<p><strong class=\"journal-contentHeaderColor\">Abstract.</strong> The demand for 3D maps of cities and road networks is steadily growing and mobile laser scanning (MLS) systems are often the preferred geo-data acquisition method for capturing such scenes. Because MLS systems are mounted on cars or vans they can acquire billions of points of road scenes within a few hours of survey. Manual processing of point clouds is labour intensive and thus time consuming and expensive. Hence, the need for rapid and automated methods for 3D mapping of dense point clouds is growing exponentially. The last five years the research on automated 3D mapping of MLS data has tremendously intensified. In this paper, we present our work on automated classification of MLS point clouds. In the present stage of the research we exploited three features &ndash; two height components and one reflectance value, and achieved an overall accuracy of 73&thinsp;%, which is really encouraging for further refining our approach.</p>",

      "abstract": "Autonomous vehicles are highly complex systems, required to function reliably in a wide variety of situations. Manually crafting software controllers for these vehicles is difficult, but there has been some success in using deep neural networks generated using machine-learning. However, deep neural networks are opaque to human engineers, rendering their correctness very difficult to prove manually; and existing automated techniques, which were not designed to operate on neural networks, fail to scale to large systems. This paper focuses on proving the adversarial robustness of deep neural networks, i.e. proving that small perturbations to a correctly-classified input to the network cannot cause it to be misclassified. We describe some of our recent and ongoing work on verifying the adversarial robustness of networks, and discuss some of the open questions we have encountered and how they might be addressed.",

      "abstract": "Human knowledge curators are intrinsically better than their digital counterparts at providing relevant answers to queries. That is mainly due to the fact that an experienced biological brain will account for relevant community expertise as well as exploit the underlying connections between knowledge pieces when offering suggestions pertinent to a specific question, whereas most automated database managers will not. We address this problem by proposing an architecture for the autonomic curation of crowdsourced knowledge, that is underpinned by semantic technologies. The architecture is instantiated in the career data domain, thus yielding Aviator, a collaborative platform capable of producing complete, intuitive and relevant answers to career related queries, in a time effective manner. In addition to providing numeric and use case based evidence to support these research claims, this extended work also contains a detailed architectural analysis of Aviator to outline its suitability for automatically curating knowledge to a high standard of quality.",

      "abstract": "We improve the performance of a low-quality GPS data on a UGV through use of multiple low-quality GPS modules on a UGV within line of sight of the UAV. The UGV sends GPS data corrections to the UAV on the basis of the distance from the UAV to the UGV as measured by scaling of a standard image pattern stuck on the UGV. Geolocation of both UGV and UAV are performed through the use of the extended Kalman filter integrating GPS aided INS. The positioning error is reduced by a factor of 2.3 in simulation studies and a factor of 1.6 in experiment when 3 GPS sensors are used on the UGV. This is better than what one can get through pure averaging of the GPS sensors in the presence of noise in measuring the UAV-UGV distance. We show how our exploitation of geometry improves GPS sensor performance as more GPS sensors are used.",

      "abstract": "<h3>Objective</h3>\n<p>Hospital electronic prescribing (ePrescribing) systems offer a wide range of patient safety benefits. Like other hospital health information technology interventions, however, they may also introduce new areas of risk. Despite recent advances in identifying these risks, the development and use of ePrescribing systems is still leading to numerous unintended consequences, which may undermine improvement and threaten patient safety. These negative consequences need to be analysed in the design, implementation and use of these systems. We therefore aimed to understand the roots of these reported threats and identify candidate avoidance/mitigation strategies.</p><h3>Methods</h3>\n<p>We analysed a longitudinal, qualitative study of the implementation and adoption of ePrescribing systems in six English hospitals, each being conceptualised as a case study. Data included semistructured interviews, observations of implementation meetings and system use, and a collection of relevant documents. We analysed data first within and then across the case studies.</p><h3>Results</h3>\n<p>Our dataset included 214 interviews, 24 observations and 18 documents. We developed a taxonomy of factors underlying unintended safety threats in: (1) suboptimal system design, including lack of support for complex medication administration regimens, lack of effective integration between different systems, and lack of effective automated decision support tools; (2) inappropriate use of systems\u2014in particular, too much reliance on the system and introduction of workarounds; and (3) suboptimal implementation strategies resulting from partial roll-outs/dual systems and lack of appropriate training. We have identified a number of system and organisational strategies that could potentially avoid or reduce these risks.</p><h3>Conclusions</h3>\n<p>Imperfections in the design, implementation and use of ePrescribing systems can give rise to unintended consequences, including safety threats. Hospitals and suppliers need to implement short- and long-term strategies in terms of the technology and organisation to minimise the unintended safety risks.</p>",

      "abstract": "The importance of using Agriculture unmanned helicopters (AUHs), especially for spraying pesticides and fertilizers on any terrain type to ensure crop yields, has been recently acknowledged. Apart from flying these helicopters at a super-low altitude and low speed, using an efficient and optimum rotor blade ensures a uniform and deep penetration of pesticide and fertilizers over a specified area. Accordingly, this work attempts to optimize the rotor blade of an AUH by using coupling statistics and several numerical techniques, including design of experiments, response surface method, and computational fluid dynamics. The experiments are designed using the central composite design method and by selecting the geometric variables that affect the aerodynamic performance of the rotor blade, including the root chord, tip chord, and angle of attack. The angle at the root and tip is optimized in order for the resulting twist to produce a uniform blade loading, achieve maximum lift, and minimize the required hover power. The required aerodynamic forces and limited availability of engine power are identified as constraints. The blade is optimized only when the helicopter is hovering at a persistent rotational speed, and the hover efficiency of the rotor blade with an optimal twist distribution is significantly higher than the baseline.",

      "abstract": "Myocardial ischemia (MI) is abnormal cardiac condition during which myocardium is deprived of blood and oxygen supply. It is the most prominent heart disease around the globe, and its prevalence increases with age factors. Accurate and timely identification and treatment of MI help to prevent from series of dreadful ischemic heart diseases such as heart attack and heart failure. However, the manual interpretation of electrocardiogram (ECG) for diagnosis of MI is tedious task for physicians. Hence, automated classification is very useful for diagnosis of MI condition. Our study presents an approach for automated diagnosis of MI condition using ECG beats. In this methodology, non-linearity in ECG is finely captured using higher-order statistics (HOS), and then, dimensionality is reduced. Confidence interval of features is verified using Student\u2019s t-test (probability (p)-value &lt;0.05). Decision Tree (DT) as the base classifier following different ensemble classifiers, viz. Adaboost (ADB), Bagging (BGG), Rotation Forest (ROF) and Random Forest (RAF) are subjected for diagnosis of normal sinus rhythm (NSR) against MI conditions. Among these, ROF is diagnosed with $$99.51 \\pm 0.31\\%$$ accuracy, $$98.82 \\pm 1.04\\%$$ sensitivity and $$99.83\\pm 0.15\\%$$ specificity. In this system, higher specificity rate defines precision in diagnosis of True Negative (TN) condition. Results achieved in this study are efficient with 0.9886 of Matthews correlation coefficient (MCC). Our proposed system is non-invasive and cost-efficient and helps in screening of MI, predominantly in rural and remote areas.",

      "abstract": "Steam Assisted Gravity Drainage (SAGD) and Solvent Vapor Extraction (VAPEX), both of the techniques have been proved to be successful for the exploitation of heavy oil reservoirs. Field development of heavy oil reservoirs requires careful determination of optimal parameters, well locations and control setting of producers and injectors. In recent years, field development decisions based on sensitivity studies have been shifting toward automated optimization. In this paper, we present the optimal parameter selection for SAGD and VAPEX. We performed the search of optimum parameters; the vertical separation between injector and producer, well controls and well locations. All these parameters have been simultaneously optimized to study and compare the performance of both processes. Also, we present an efficient method to constrain horizontal wells to preset minimum well spacing constraints. This method was then applied to constrain the well spacing between different peers of horizontal wells in the SAGD and VAPEX processes. The particle swarm optimization was used as an optimizer to determine the optimum parameters. The results indicated that the method could successfully determine the optimal parameters while satisfying the spacing constraint imposed by the user. The comparison of the results showed the better performance of SAGD over VAPEX process.",

Predictions of higher mean summer temperatures and prolonged summer draughts may pose a threat to agriculture areas and forest canopies. Rising canopy temperatures can be an indicator of plant stress because of the closure of stomata and a decrease in the transpiration rate. <br><br> Thermal cameras are available for decades, but still often used for single image analysis, only in oblique view manner or with visual evaluations of video sequences. <br><br> Therefore remote sensing using a thermal camera can be an important data source to understand transpiration processes. <br><br> Photogrammetric workflows allow to process thermal images similar to RGB data. But low spatial resolution of thermal cameras, significant optical distortion and typically low contrast require an adapted workflow. Temperature distribution in forest canopies is typically completely unknown and less distinct than for urban or industrial areas, where metal constructions and surfaces yield high contrast and sharp edge information. <br><br> The aim of this paper is to investigate the influence of interior camera orientation, tie point matching and ground control points on the resulting accuracy of bundle adjustment and dense cloud generation with a typically used photogrammetric workflow for UAVbased thermal imagery in natural environments.</p>",

Once the concept is finalized and functional, the workflow can be used for energy demand estimations for buildings by exploiting existing methods for estimation of heat transfer coefficient and the transmitted heat loss. The multimodal system consists of a thermal, a hyperspectral and an optical sensor, which can be operational with a UAV. While dealing with sensors that operate in different spectra and have different technical specifications, such as the radiometric and the geometric resolution, the challenges that are faced are presented. Addressed are the different approaches of data fusion, such as image registration, generation of 3D models by performing image matching and the means for classification based on either the geometry of the object or the pixel values. As a first step towards realizing the concept, the result from a geometric calibration with a designed multimodal calibration pattern is presented.</p>",

For example, site-specific fertilizer application as part of precision agriculture (PA) management requires information within short time. But, this requires field-based measurements with hyper- or multispectral sensors, which may not be feasible on a day to day farming practice. Exploiting the information of RGB images from consumer grade cameras mounted on unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV) can offer cost-efficient as well as near-real time analysis of grasslands with high temporal and spatial resolution. The potential of RGB imagery-based vegetation indices (VI) from consumer grade cameras mounted on UAVs has been explored recently in several. However, for multitemporal analyses it is desirable to calibrate the digital numbers (DN) of RGB-images to physical units. In this study, we explored the comparability of the RGBVI from a consumer grade camera mounted on a low-cost UAV to well established vegetation indices from hyperspectral field measurements for applications in grassland. The study was conducted in 2014 on the Rengen Grassland Experiment (RGE) in Germany. Image DN values were calibrated into reflectance by using the Empirical Line Method (Smith & Milton 1999). Depending on sampling date and VI the correlation between the UAV-based RGBVI and VIs such as the NDVI resulted in varying R2 values from no correlation to up to 0.9. These results indicate, that calibrated RGB-based VIs have the potential to support or substitute hyperspectral field measurements to facilitate management decisions on grasslands.</p>",

      "abstract": "The concept of two-factor multiserver authentication protocol was developed to avoid multiple number of registrations using multiple smart-cards and passwords. Recently, a variety of two-factor multiserver authentication protocols have been developed. It is observed that the existing RSA-based multiserver authentication protocols are not suitable in terms of computation complexities and security attacks. To provide lower complexities and security resilience against known attacks, this article proposes a two-factor (password and smart-card) user authentication protocol with the RSA cryptosystem for multiserver environments. The comprehensive security discussion proved that the known security attacks are eliminated in our protocol. Besides, our protocol supports session key agreement and mutual authentication between the application server and the user. We analyze the proof of correctness of the mutual authentication and freshness of session key using the BAN logic model. The experimental outcomes obtained through simulation of the Automated Validation of Internet Security Protocols and Applications (AVISPA) S/W show that our protocol is secured. We consider the computation, communication, and storage costs and the comparative explanations show that our protocol is flexible and efficient compared with protocols. In addition, our protocol offers security resilience against known attacks and provides lower computation complexities than existing protocols. Additionally, the protocol offers password change facility to the authorized user.",

      "abstract": "<p><strong class=\"journal-contentHeaderColor\">Abstract.</strong> The Schwartzenbourg castle is a Middle-Ages fortress which was built in 1261. It is situated above the valley of Munster in Alsace, France. It was mainly used as a fortified place and a jail. In the early 15th century, the structure has deteriorated. Even after some repairs, it fell into ruins during the Thirty Years\u2019 war (1618-1648) and stayed uninhabited. During World War I, the German army used the place as a vantage point and also built a blockhouse inside the ruins. Nowadays, the ruins are gradually collapsing and the remains of the old walls are completely covered by thick plants.<br><br> The goal of this project was to create a 3D-model of the site before closing its access, which became too dangerous for people. This modelling is divided into two elements: on one hand, a digital terrain model (DTM) of the site in order to replace the castle and to analyze the background of its original environment; on the other hand, a 3D modelling of the ruins of the castle invaded by the vegetation. Indeed, the main difficulty of the measurement is obviously the dense vegetation which hides the castle. Held back for years outside the castle, it has now become an integral part of the ruins. This vegetation is finally today usually the first threat of heritage buildings. After a preliminary inspection of the site as well as difficulties of the project, the first step consisted of the survey of the whole environment of the site. We will therefore describe the different phases of the survey with the initial implementation of a georeferenced network on site. We will present the terrestrial laser scanning (TLS) surveys, then complementary surveys carried out by aerial photogrammetry. To be implemented, we had to wait for an advanced autumn in order to have as few leaves on trees as possible. The major step of processing of point clouds described in this paper is then the extraction of a DTM by using techniques to pass through the vegetation, or better to segment the points into different classes, one of these that would be the soil i.e. DTM, another consists into wall parts of the ruins.</p>",

To perform these applications, cameras and laserscanners are a good sensor combination, due to their complementary properties. To exploit this sensor combination the intrinsics and relative poses of the individual cameras and the relative poses of the cameras and the laserscanners have to be known. In this manuscript, we present a calibration methodology for the <i>Unified Intrinsic and Extrinsic Calibration of a Multi-Camera-System and a Laserscanner (UCalMiCeL)</i>. The innovation of this methodology, which is an extension to the calibration of a single camera to a line laserscanner, is an unifying bundle adjustment step to ensure an optimal calibration of the entire sensor system. We use generic camera models, including pinhole, omnidirectional and fisheye cameras. For our approach, the laserscanner and each camera have to share a joint field of view, whereas the fields of view of the individual cameras may be disjoint. The calibration approach is tested with a sensor system consisting of two fisheye cameras and a line laserscanner with a range measuring accuracy of 30&thinsp;<i>mm</i>. We evaluate the estimated relative poses between the cameras quantitatively by using an additional calibration approach for Multi-Camera-Systems based on control points which are accurately measured by a motion capture system. In the experiments, our novel calibration method achieves a relative pose estimation with a deviation below 1.8&deg; and 6.4&thinsp;<i>mm</i>.</p>",

Here, we present an atlas of the abyssal annelid, arthropod, bryozoan, chordate, ctenophore and molluscan megafauna observed and collected during the ABYSSLINE cruises to the UK-1 polymetallic-nodule exploration contract area in the CCZ. There appear to be at least 55 distinct morphospecies (8 Annelida, 12 Arthropoda, 4 Bryozoa, 22 Chordata, 5 Ctenophora, and 4 Mollusca) identified mostly by morphology but also using molecular barcoding for a limited number of animals that were collected. This atlas will aid the synthesis of megafaunal presence/absence data collected by contractors, scientists and other stakeholders undertaking work in the CCZ, ultimately helping to decipher the biogeography of the megafauna in this threatened habitat.",

      "abstract": "Hundreds of herbarium collections have accumulated a valuable heritage and knowledge of plants over several centuries. Recent initiatives started ambitious preservation plans to digitize this information and make it available to botanists and the general public through web portals. However, thousands of sheets are still unidentified at the species level while numerous sheets should be reviewed and updated following more recent taxonomic knowledge. These annotations and revisions require an unrealistic amount of work for botanists to carry out in a reasonable time. Computer vision and machine learning approaches applied to herbarium sheets are promising but are still not well studied compared to automated species identification from leaf scans or pictures of plants in the field. In this work, we propose to study and evaluate the accuracy with which herbarium images can be potentially exploited for species identification with deep learning technology. In addition, we propose to study if the combination of herbarium sheets with photos of plants in the field is relevant in terms of accuracy, and finally, we explore if herbarium images from one region that has one specific flora can be used to do transfer learning to another region with other species; for example, on a region under-represented in terms of collected data. This is, to our knowledge, the first study that uses deep learning to analyze a big dataset with thousands of species from herbaria. Results show the potential of Deep Learning on herbarium species identification, particularly by training and testing across different datasets from different herbaria. This could potentially lead to the creation of a semi, or even fully automated system to help taxonomists and experts with their annotation, classification, and revision works.",

      "abstract": "Data from vehicles instrumented with GPS or other localization technologies are increasingly becoming widely available due to the investments in Connected and Automated Vehicles (CAVs) and the prevalence of personal mobile devices such as smartphones. Tracking or trajectory data from these probe vehicles are already being used in practice for travel time or speed estimation and for monitoring network conditions. However, there has been limited work on extracting other critical traffic flow variables, in particular density and flow, from probe data. This paper presents a microscopic approach (akin to car-following) for inferring the number of unobserved vehicles in between a set of probe vehicles in the traffic stream. In particular, we develop algorithms to extract and exploit the somewhat regular patterns in the trajectories when the probe vehicles travel through stop-and-go waves in congested traffic. Using certain critical points of trajectories as the input, the number of unobserved vehicles between consecutive probes are then estimated through a Na\u00c3\u00afve Bayes model. The parameters needed for the Na\u00c3\u00afve Bayes include means and standard deviations for the probability density functions (pdfs) for the distance headways between vehicles. These parameters are estimated through supervised as well as unsupervised learning methods. The proposed ideas are tested based on the trajectory data collected from US 101 and I-80 in California for the FHWA's NGSIM (next generation simulation) project.

We propose two feature-based algorithms that rely on gradually extracting the tower's notable features from the scans, and then exploiting the simple geometry of the cross-sections to estimate the tower's position and orientation in the sensor frame. As a by-product, it is shown that a preliminary 3D reconstruction of the tower can be built from the scans. The proposed solutions can be easily implemented on-board a MAV in real time.

To improve this issue, a hierarchical genetic algorithm with optimized search region (OSR-HGA) is proposed. This algorithm reduces the search area of hierarchical genetic algorithm automatically by evaluating the distribution of threat sources in the mission area. To guide the searching direction of the algorithm and reduce the occurrence of detours, the heading correction cost and minimum turning radius cost are added to the cost function. The experimental results show the new method can enhance the stability of path planning algorithm by finding shorter paths with less cost and reducing the occurrence of detours effectively. \u00c2\u00a9 2017 IEEE.",

      "abstract": "Snakes change their locomotion patterns in response to the environment. This ability is a motivation for developing snake-like robots with highly adaptive functionality. In this study, a decentralised control scheme of snake-like robots that exhibited autonomous gait transition (i.e. the transition between concertina locomotion in narrow aisles and scaffold-based locomotion on unstructured terrains) was developed. Additionally, the control scheme was validated via simulations. A key insight revealed is that these locomotion patterns were not preprogrammed but emerged by exploiting Tegotae, a concept that describes the extent to which a perceived reaction matches a generated action. Unlike local reflexive mechanisms proposed previously, the Tegotae-based feedback mechanism enabled the robot to 'selectively' exploit environments beneficial for propulsion, and generated reasonable locomotion patterns. It is expected that the results of this study can form the basis to design robots that can work under unpredictable and unstructured environments. \u00c2\u00a9 2017 IOP Publishing Ltd.",

They are also beginning to interconnect and interoperate to form complex systems-of-systems. The cyberattack surfaces of these systems-of-systems are expanding exponentially. Currently, many related systems are standalone, but when they are integrated, vulnerabilities of, and threats to, the resulting systems-of-systems could grow so much that they might well detract from the potential of these systems to improve safety and gain fuel use due to reduced travel times. Despite warnings, few are focusing on improving cybersecurity of the entire system-of-systems as the self-driving, ground-vehicle juggernaut ploughs ahead. Far too little attention is being paid to vulnerabilities throughout the systems-of-systems that will undoubtedly arise when the myriad of systems is interconnected and interoperate. In this paper, we discuss the cybersecurity consequences of the current uncoordinated evolution of these systems-of-systems and describe how such risks might be mitigated by, among other approaches, proactively introducing cybersecurity requirements early in the design, development and deployment process. \u00c2\u00a9 2017 IEEE.",

      "abstract": "Lane marks on roads are among the most important items of road scene information in the process of autonomous driving, and lane-mark extraction based on visual cognitive computing is one of the most important components of advanced driving assistance systems in intelligent transportation system. Onboard cameras mounted on the front of autonomous vehicles capture road scene images from which lane marks are extracted. This paper proposes a new lane-mark extraction algorithm with four major parts. First, this paper handles the road images captured from onboard cameras by grayscale and fast median filter. Then, we exploit the characteristics of lane marks in road images as constraints to propose lane-features filter based on multi-constraints used to extract lane marks. Then, a clustering algorithm based on the double point removal of a p -least squares algorithm is proposed to cluster features, and recursive dichotomy algorithm is used to fit the candidate lane marks. Finally, we carry out verification and optimization on candidate lane marks to obtain more accurate and stable extraction results. In our experiment, we divide the common complex road scenes into four categories. The results show that the proposed method can robustly extract lane marks under various complex real conditions. This paper also proposes forward a method to evaluate the results of lane-mark extraction, and partial test results are evaluated. \u00c2\u00a9 2013 IEEE.",

      "abstract": "This paper presents the design and implementation of an adaptive-repetitive visual-servo control system for a moving high-flying vehicle (HFV) with an uncalibrated camera to monitor, track, and precisely control the movements of a low-flying vehicle (LFV) or mobile ground robot. Applications of this control strategy include the use of high-flying unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) with computer vision for monitoring, controlling, and coordinating the movements of lower altitude agents in areas, for example, where GPS signals may be unreliable or nonexistent. When deployed, a remote operator of the HFV defines the desired trajectory for the LFV in the HFV\u2019s camera frame. Due to the circular motion of the HFV, the resulting motion trajectory of the LFV in the image frame can be periodic in time, thus an adaptive-repetitive control system is exploited for regulation and/or trajectory tracking. The adaptive control law is able to handle uncertainties in the camera\u2019s intrinsic and extrinsic parameters. The design and stability analysis of the closed-loop control system is presented, where Lyapunov stability is shown. Simulation and experimental results are presented to demonstrate the effectiveness of the method for controlling the movement of a low-flying quadcopter, demonstrating the capabilities of the visual-servo control system for localization (i.e.,, motion capturing) and trajectory tracking control. In fact, results show that the LFV can be commanded to hover in place as well as track a user-defined flower-shaped closed trajectory, while the HFV and camera system circulates above with constant angular velocity. On average, the proposed adaptive-repetitive visual-servo control system reduces the average RMS tracking error by over 77% in the image plane and over 71% in the world frame compared to using just the adaptive visual-servo control law.",

      "abstract": "With the advancement of digital microfluidics technology, applications such as on-chip DNA analysis, point of care diagnosis and automated drug discovery are common nowadays. The use of Digital Microfluidics Biochips (DMFBs) in disease assessment and recognition of target molecules had become popular during the past few years. The reliability of these DMFBs is crucial when they are used in various medical applications. Errors found in these biochips are mainly due to the defects developed during droplet manipulation, chip degradation and inaccuracies in the bio-assay experiments. The recently proposed Micro-electrode-dot Array (MEDA)-based DMFBs involve both fluidic and electronic domains in the micro-electrode cell. Thus, the testing techniques for these biochips should be revised in order to ensure proper functionality. This paper describes recent advances in the testing technologies for digital microfluidics biochips, which would serve as a useful platform for developing revised/new testing techniques for MEDA-based biochips. Therefore, the relevancy of these techniques with respect to testing of MEDA-based biochips is analyzed in order to exploit the full potential of these biochips.",

      "abstract": "Now and again, the rapid proliferation of certain species of phytoplankton can give rise to Harmful Algal Blooms, which pose a serious threat to marine life and human health. Current methods of monitoring phytoplankton are limited by poor specificity or by the requirement to return samples to a highly resourced, centralised lab. The Lab Card is a small, microfluidic cassette which, when used in tandem with a portable Lab Card Reader can be used to sensitively and specifically quantify harmful algae in the field, from nucleic acid extracts using RNA amplification; a sensitive and specific method for the enumeration of potentially any species based on their unique genetic signatures. This study reports the culmination of work to develop a Lab Card-based genetic assay to quantify the harmful algae Karenia brevis using mRNA amplification by the Nucleic Acid Sequence Based Amplification (NASBA) method. K. brevis cells were quantified by amplification of the rbcL gene transcript in nucleic acid extracts of K. brevis cell samples. A novel enzyme dehydration and preservation method was combined with a pre-existing reagent Gelification method to prepare fully preserved Lab Cards with a shelf-life of at least six weeks prior to use. Using an internal control (IC), the Lab Card-based rbcL NASBA was demonstrated for the quantification of K. brevis from cell extracts containing between 50 and 5000 cells. This is the first demonstration of quantitation of K. brevis using IC-NASBA on a Lab Card. \u00c2\u00a9 2017",

      "abstract": "Objectives Programmed death-ligand 1 (PD-L1) is a widely used biomarker for predicting immune checkpoint inhibitors, but is of limited usefulness in the prediction of drug response. MYC, a transcription factor that is overexpressed in cancers, is involved in preventing immune cells from attacking tumor cells through inducing PD-L1 expression. This study evaluated the relationship between MYC and PD-L1 expression in 84 non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients who underwent curative surgical resection. Materials and Methods The relationship between MYC and PD-L1 was investigated by introducing pcDNA3-cMYC into A549 and H1299 cells with low PD-L1 expression and siRNA against MYC into H60 and H2009 cells with high PD-L1 expression. Expression of PD-L1 in NSCLC tissues was analyzed by immunostaining using a PD-L1 (22C3) PharmDx protocol using the Dako Automated Link 48 platform and expression of MYC was determined using anti-c-MYC (Y69) (ab320720). Results Of 84 patients, PD-L1 was expressed in 14 (16.7%) and MYC was overexpressed in 30 (35.7%). We investigated the relationship between PD-L1 and MYC expression. There were 49 (58.3%) double-negative patients and 9 (10.7%) double-positive patients. Significant positive correlation was observed between PD-L1 and MYC expression (\u00ce\u00b3\u00c2 =\u00c2 0.210, P\u00c2 =\u00c2 0.029). Double-negative patients showed better disease free (31.1 vs. 7.1 months, P\u00c2 =\u00c2 0.011) and overall survival (56.1 vs. 14.4 months, P\u00c2 =\u00c2 0.032) than double-positive patients. Conclusion Taken together, MYC expression significantly correlated with PD-L1 expression in NSCLC. The usefulness of MYC expression as a surrogate marker of treatment response assessment is worth evaluating for immune checkpoint inhibitor therapy and special interest are required for the subgroup of NSCLC patients, whose tumor expresses PD-L1 and MYC double positive. \u00c2\u00a9 2017 Elsevier B.V.",

      "abstract": "Despite the efficacy of neuroprotective approaches in animal models of stroke, their translation has so far failed from bench to bedside. One reason is presumed to be a low quality of preclinical study design, leading to bias and a low a priori power. In this study, we propose that the key read-out of experimental stroke studies, the volume of the ischemic damage as commonly measured by free-handed planimetry of TTC-stained brain sections, is subject to an unrecognized low inter-rater and test-retest reliability with strong implications for statistical power and bias. As an alternative approach, we suggest a simple, open-source, software-assisted method, taking advantage of automatic-thresholding techniques. The validity and the improvement of reliability by an automated method to tMCAO infarct volumetry are demonstrated. In addition, we show the probable consequences of increased reliability for precision, p-values, effect inflation, and power calculation, exemplified by a systematic analysis of experimental stroke studies published in the year 2015. Our study reveals an underappreciated quality problem in translational stroke research and suggests that software-assisted infarct volumetry might help to improve reproducibility and therefore the robustness of bench to bedside translation. \u00c2\u00a9 2016, \u00c2\u00a9 The Author(s) 2016.",

      "abstract": "This article develops a spatial partition-based particle filtering framework to support data assimilation for large-scale wildfire spread simulation effectively. The developed spatial partition-based particle filtering framework breaks the system state and observation data into smaller spatial regions and then carries out localized particle filtering based on these spatial regions. Particle Filters (PFs) hold great promise to support data assimilation for spatial temporal simulations, such as wildfire spread simulation, to achieve more accurate simulation or prediction results. However, PFs face major challenges to work effectively for complex spatial temporal simulations due to the high-dimensional state space of the simulation models, which typically cover large areas and have a large number of spatially dependent state variables. The developed framework exploits the spatial locality property of system state and observation data and employs the divide-and-conquer principle to reduce state dimension and data complexity. This framework is especially developed for a discrete event cellular space model (the wildfire simulation model), which significantly differs from prior works that use numerical models specified by partial differential equations (PDEs) with continuous variables. Within this framework, a two-level automated spatial partitioning method is presented to provide automated and balanced spatial partitions with fewer boundary sensors. The developed framework is applied to a wildfire spread simulation and achieved improved results compared to using standard PF-based data assimilation methods. \u00c2\u00a9 2017 ACM.",

      "abstract": "As the advent of the Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) has been increased, the protection of the information within the transmitted or stored video has become a big challenge. Most known drone systems attach metadata of the recorded video in separate files or in the header of the video. Current techniques make the metadata unsecure and easy to get lost and removed as well as it occupies more storage and bandwidth. In this paper, an efficient method is proposed to hide the metadata of UAVs video using the technology of digital watermarking. Discrete Wavelet Transform (DWT) is used to implement the embedding of the information robustly. The middle frequencies coefficients reside on CH3 sub-band are utilized to hide the watermark bits. In addition, a new scrambling algorithm is proposed to secure the information before hiding. The adaption of the proposed video watermarking algorithm to hide the metadata of the UAV video is achieved. The experimental results prove the high performance of the proposed method. The method had unnoticeable impact on the video quality where the PSNR of 44&nbsp;dB is attained. The experiments show that the method achieves high robustness under various attacks and provides enough capacity for metadata hiding of UAV video.",

Mainly, these systems operate in conditions of under-actuation, which make the control a serious task especially in presence of practical constraints. The main objective within this paper is to ensure the tracking of 3D reference trajectory overcoming some of the issues related to the control of multi-rotor vehicles (such as underactuation, robustness, limited power, accuracy, overshoot, etc.). Therefore, a control scheme for Vertical Take Off and Landing (VTOL) multi-rotor Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) is designed, applying the Interconnection and Damping Assignment-Passivity Based Control (IDA-PBC) technique. As reference model based technique, the control specifications are readily met by fixing a desired dynamic model, which is a major advantage of the technique. Moreover, a port \u2212controlled Hamiltonian representation is exploited in order to point out the physical properties of the system such as its internal energy. This latter is exploited, as a fitness function for an optimization algorithm, in order to decrease the consumed energy especially at the take-off step and allows the tuning of the controller parameters. The numerical simulations have shown satisfactory results that support the claims using nominal system model or disturbed model. The designed controller has been implemented on a real vehicle for which one demonstrates, in an indoor area manipulation, the effectiveness of the proposed control strategy.",

The scope of study is the road driver behaviour on approach towards unmanned railway level crossings and therefore, the prevention of life losses at unmanned railway level crossings. To fulfill these aims, a questionnaire was prepared and road driver survey was conducted on 458 road drivers moving across nineteen road vehicle-train collision prone unmanned railway level crossings on Shahdra-Shamli-Tapri railway route in the Northern region of India. Thereafter, the responses of the road drivers were analyzed. The results suggest that, the developed vehicle collision threat detection and avoidance system helps in masking the negative effect of all road drivers' problems that affect the road drivers approaching the unmanned railway level crossings.",

      "abstract": "Solar energy is considered as one of the main sources for renewable energy in the near future. However, solar energy and other renewable energy sources have a drawback related to the difficulty in predicting their availability in the near future. This problem affects optimal exploitation of solar energy, especially in connection with other resources. Therefore, reliable solar energy prediction models are essential to solar energy management and economics. This paper presents work aimed at designing reliable models to predict the global horizontal irradiance (GHI) for the next day in 8 stations in Saudi Arabia. The designed models are based on computational intelligence methods of automated-design fuzzy logic systems. The fuzzy logic systems are designed and optimized with two models using fuzzy c-means clustering (FCM) and simulated annealing (SA) algorithms. The first model uses FCM based on the subtractive clustering algorithm to automatically design the predictor fuzzy rules from data. The second model is using FCM followed by simulated annealing algorithm to enhance the prediction accuracy of the fuzzy logic system. The objective of the predictor is to accurately predict next-day global horizontal irradiance (GHI) using previous-day meteorological and solar radiation observations. The proposed models use observations of 10 variables of measured meteorological and solar radiation data to build the model. The experimentation and results of the prediction are detailed where the root mean square error of the prediction was approximately 88% for the second model tuned by simulated annealing compared to 79.75% accuracy using the first model. This results demonstrate a good modeling accuracy of the second model despite that the training and testing of the proposed models were carried out using spatially and temporally independent data.",

      "abstract": "Feature extraction and matching is a crucial task in the fields of computer vision and photogrammetry. Even though wide researches have been reported, some issues are still existing for oblique images. This paper exploits the use of on-board GNSS/IMU (Global Navigation Satellite System/Inertial Measurement Unit) data to achieve efficient and reliable feature extraction and matching for oblique unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) images. Firstly, rough POS (Positioning and Orientation System) is calculated for each image with cooperation of on-board GNSS/IMU data and camera installation angles, which enables image rectification and footprint calculation. Secondly, two robust strategies, including the geometric rectification and tile strategy, are considered to address the issues caused by perspective deformations and to relieve the side-effects of image down-sampling. According to the results of individual performance evaluation, four combinations of these two strategies are designed and comprehensively compared in BA (Bundle Adjustment) experiments by using a real oblique UAV dataset. The results reported in this paper demonstrate that the solution with the tiling strategy is superior to the other solutions in terms of efficiency, completeness and accuracy. For feature extraction and matching of oblique UAV images, it is proposed to combine the tiling strategy with existing workflows to achieve an efficient and reliable solution.",

Applying expert-derived thresholds to specific bioactivities allowed an activity call to be attributed to each data entry. Human intervention further improved this mechanistic dataset which was mined to develop structure-activity relationship alerts and an expert model covering 45 chemical classes for the prediction of oestrogen receptor modulation. The evaluation of the model using FDA EDKB and Tox21 data was quite encouraging. This model can also provide a teratogenicity prediction along with the additional information it provides relevant to the query compound, all of which will require careful assessment of potential risk by experts. \u00c2\u00a9 2017 Wiley-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

R2U2 is designed to continuously monitor inputs from on-board components such as the GPS, the ground control station, other sensor readings, actuator outputs, and flight software status. By simultaneously monitoring and performing statistical reasoning, attack patterns and post-attack discrepancies in the UAS behavior can be detected. R2U2 uses runtime observer pairs for Linear and Metric Temporal Logics for property monitoring and Bayesian networks for diagnosis of system health during runtime.

      "abstract": "Remote sensing methods to study spatial and temporal changes in water quality using satellite or aerial imagery are limited by the inherently low reflectance signal of water across the visible and near infrared spectrum, as well as environmental variables such as surface scattering effects (sun glint), substrate and aquatic vegetation reflectance, and atmospheric effects. This study exploits the low altitude, high-resolution remote sensing capabilities of unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) platforms to examine the major environmental variables that affect water reflectance acquisition, without the confounding influence of atmospheric effects typical of higher-altitude platforms. After observation and analysis, we found: (1) multiple water spectra measured at the same location had a standard deviation of 10.4%; (2) water spectra changes associated with increasing altitude from 20\u00c2 m to 100\u00c2 m were negligible; (3) the difference between mean reflectance at three off-shore locations in an urban water body reached 29.9%; (4) water bottom visibility increased water reflectance by 20.1% in near shore areas compared to deep water spectra in a clear water lake; (5) emergent plants caused the water spectra to shift towards a shape that is characteristic of vegetation, whereas submerged vegetation showed limited effect on water spectra in the studied lake; (6) cloud and sun glint had major effects and caused water spectra to change abruptly; while glint and shadow effects on spectra may balance each other under certain conditions, the water reflectance can also be unpredictable at times due to wave effects and their effects on lines-of-site to calm water; (7) water spectra collected under a variety of different conditions (e.g. multiple locations, waves) resulted in weaker regression models compared to spectra collected under ideal conditions (e.g. single location, no wave), although the resulting model coefficients were relatively stable. The methods and results from this study contribute to better understanding of water reflectance acquisition using remote sensing, and can be applied in UAV-based water quality assessment or to aid in validation of higher altitude imagery. \u00c2\u00a9 2017 International Society for Photogrammetry and Remote Sensing, Inc.

      "abstract": "Many applications in speech, robotics, finance, and biology deal with sequential data, where ordering matters and recurrent structures are common. However, this structure cannot be easily captured by standard kernel functions. To model such structure, we propose expressive closed-form kernel functions for Gaussian processes. The resulting model, GP-LSTM, fully encapsulates the inductive biases of long short-term memory (LSTM) recurrent networks, while retaining the non-parametric probabilistic advantages of Gaussian processes. We learn the properties of the proposed kernels by optimizing the Gaussian process marginal likelihood using a new provably convergent semi-stochastic gradient procedure, and exploit the structure of these kernels for scalable training and prediction. This approach provides a practical representation for Bayesian LSTMs. We demonstrate state-of-the-art performance on several benchmarks, and thoroughly investigate a consequential autonomous driving application, where the predictive uncertainties provided by GP-LSTM are uniquely valuable. \u00c2\u00a9 2017 Maruan Al-Shedivat, Andrew Gordon Wilson, Yunus Saatchi, Zhiting Hu and Eric P.

      "abstract": "Multi-robot networks use wireless communication to provide wide-ranging services such as aerial surveillance and unmanned delivery. However, effective coordination between multiple robots requires trust, making them particularly vulnerable to cyber-attacks. Specifically, such networks can be gravely disrupted by the Sybil attack, where even a single malicious robot can spoof a large number of fake clients. This paper proposes a new solution to defend against the Sybil attack, without requiring expensive cryptographic key-distribution. Our core contribution is a novel algorithm implemented on commercial Wi-Fi radios that can \u201csense\u201d spoofers using the physics of wireless signals. We derive theoretical guarantees on how this algorithm bounds the impact of the Sybil Attack on a broad class of multi-robot problems, including locational coverage and unmanned delivery. We experimentally validate our claims using a team of AscTec quadrotor servers and iRobot Create ground clients, and demonstrate spoofer detection rates over 96%.",

      "abstract": "This paper investigates the effectiveness of multipath-decorrelating antenna motion in reducing the initialization time of global navigation satellite system (GNSS) receivers employing low-cost single-frequency antennas for carrier-phase differential GNSS (CDGNSS) positioning. Fast initialization times with low-cost antennas will encourage the expansion of CDGNSS into the mass market, bringing the benefits of globally referenced centimeter-accurate positioning to many consumer applications, such as augmented reality and autonomous vehicles, that have so far been hampered by the several-meter-level errors of traditional GNSS positioning. Poor multipath suppression common to low-cost antennas results in large and strongly time-correlated phase errors when a receiver is static. Such errors can result in the CDGNSS initialization time, the so-called time to ambiguity resolution (TAR), extending to hundreds of seconds - many times longer than for higher cost survey-grade antennas, which have substantially better multipath suppression. This paper demonstrates that TAR can be significantly reduced through antenna motion, particularly gentle wavelength-scale random antenna motion. Such motion acts to decrease the correlation time of the multipath-induced phase errors. A priori knowledge of the motion profile is shown to further reduce TAR, with the reduction shown to be more pronounced as the initialization scenario is more challenging. \u00c2\u00a9 1965-2011 IEEE.",

      "abstract": "Vibrio cholerae, the most hazardous Vibrio species, is threatening aquacultured animals and even human beings. In recent years, a few genetic markers that target V. cholerae have been reported, but their application was limited by techniques or themselves. The outer membrane lipoprotein gene lolB has been identified as a specific marker by using PCR and quantitative PCR methods. In this study, we developed a real-time recombinase polymerase amplification (RPA) assay targeting lolB gene in an attempt to provide a sensitive, rapid, and reliable detection method of V. cholerae. The sensitivity of RPA assay was determined by amplifying the standard plasmid dilutions. The detection limit down to five copies was achieved within 10&nbsp;min, which was lower than that of qPCR (ten copies after 25&nbsp;cycles within 1.5&nbsp;h). The reproducibility of RPA assay was verified by eight independent experiments, presenting a high R 2 value of the standard regression line (0.97). In addition, the specificity was confirmed with DNA extracted from other bacteria, shrimps, clams, and fishes using both methods. Finally, V. cholerae in shrimp samples were quantified using real-time RPA and qPCR with consistent outcomes, while no amplification was obtained from clam and fish samples using both methods. The applicability in the food industry was confirmed by quantitative detection of natural seafood.",

      "abstract": "The capability of discriminating radar targets exhibiting multiple moving parts has become of great interest for both aerospace and ground-based target recognition and analysis. In particular, helicopters and other targets with rotors, as for instance miniature Unmanned Aerial Vehicles, exhibit peculiar characteristics in the radar return that can be used for their recognition. In this paper a novel algorithm to address the problem of micro-Doppler signature unmixing is proposed, exploiting the signal separation capabilities of the Independent Component Analysis (ICA). The core of the algorithm is represented precisely by the use of the ICA procedure, that has been already proved to be a very effective technique for separating hidden information in mixtures of observations. ICA has been successfully employed in several applications such as wireless communications, radar beamforming, trace-gases unmixing and medical imaging processing. The helicopter's rotor blade signature unmixing from a multi-static radar system is considered as case study and results obtained through the application of ICA to simulated multi-component micro-Doppler signatures show the capability of the proposed approach to successfully accomplish the unmixing operation. \u00c2\u00a9 2017 IEEE.",

      "abstract": "The growth of the Internet and telecommunication technology has facilitated remote access. During the last decade, numerous remote user authentication schemes based on dynamic ID have been proposed for the multi-server environment using smart cards. Recently, Shunmuganathan et al. pointed out that Li et al.\u2019s scheme is defenseless in resisting the password guessing attack, stolen smart card attack and forgery attack. Furthermore, they showed the poor repairability and no two-factor security in Li et al.\u2019s scheme. To surmount these security disadvantages, Shunmuganathan et al. proposed a remote user authentication scheme using smart card for multi-server environment and claimed that their scheme is secure and efficient. In this paper, we show that Shunmuganathan et al.\u2019s scheme is also defenseless in resisting the password guessing attack, stolen smart card attack, user impersonation attack, forgery attack, forward secrecy and session key secrecy. Moreover, the two-factor security is also not preserved in their scheme. In our proposed scheme, a user is free to choose his/her login credentials such as user id and password. And also a user can regenerate the password any time. Simultaneously the proposed scheme preserves the merits of Shunmuganathan et al.\u2019s scheme and also provides better functionality and security features, such as mutual authentication, session key agreement and perfect forward secrecy. The security analysis using the widely accepted Burrows\u2013Abadi\u2013Needham logic shows that the proposed scheme provides the mutual authentication proof between a user and a server. Through the rigorous formal and informal security analysis, we show that the proposed scheme is secure against possible known attacks. In addition, we carry out the simulation of the proposed scheme using the most-widely accepted and used Automated Validation of Internet Security Protocols and Applications tool and the simulation results clearly indicate that our scheme is secure.",

      "abstract": "Wearable devices can gather sensitive information about their users. For this reason, automated authentication and identification techniques are increasingly adopted to ensure security and privacy. Furthermore, identification can be used to automatically customize operations according to the needs of the current user. A gait-based identification method that can be executed in real time on devices with limited resources is here presented. The method exploits a wearable accelerometer to continuously analyze the user\u00e2\u0080\u0099s gait pattern and perform identification. Experiments were conducted with 10 volunteers, who carried the device in a trouser pocket and followed their daily routine without predefined constraints. In total, \u00e2\u0088\u00bc98 hours of acceleration traces were collected in uncontrolled environment, including 3073 gait segments. User identification results show a recognition rate ranging from 95% to 100%, depending on the mode of operation. It is demonstrated that the method can be executed on a standalone device with <8 KB of RAM. In addition, the energy consumption is evaluated and compared with an architecture that requires the presence of an external computing unit. Results show that the proposed solution significantly improves the lifetime of the device (approximately +70% for the considered platform), hence fostering user acceptance. \u00c2\u00a9 The British Computer Society 2017.

The types of assets to be deployed depend on different aspects such as their endurance, coverage and cost. The Joint Research Centre (JRC) together with the Department of Aeronautic and Space Engineering at the Politecnico di Torino, have developed two complementary low-cost radar systems on board of an aerostat and of a drone. A Frequency Modulated Continuous Wave (FMCW) radar has been identified as the technical solution, whereas an integrated I\u00ce\u00bcGPS platform has been used as navigation engine. The synchronization between units is fundamental, therefore various solutions have been investigated. The selected approach exploits the time-referenced matching between radar and navigation datasets. To evaluate the performance of the assembled system, several tests have been carried out in pre-operational conditions with the radar performing several azimuthal scans with fixed elevation angle. From the results, no drift nor bias in the attitude parameters have been observed. Moreover the adopted integration strategy allows reconstructing the polar radar picture, exploiting the synergy between the radar and the navigation units. The obtained radar pictures are consistent from scan to scan and correctly characterize the actual scenario. \u00c2\u00a9 2017 IEEE.",

      "abstract": "This paper addresses the problem of autonomous servoing an unmanned redundant aerial manipulator using computer vision. The overactuation of the system is exploited by means of a hierarchical control law, which allows to prioritize several tasks during flight. We propose a safety-related primary task to avoid possible collisions. As a secondary task, we present an uncalibrated image-based visual servo strategy to drive the arm end-effector to a desired position and orientation by using a camera attached to it. In contrast to the previous visual servo approaches, a known value of camera focal length is not strictly required. To further improve flight behavior, we hierarchically add one task to reduce dynamic effects by vertically aligning the arm center of gravity to the multirotor gravitational vector, and another one that keeps the arm close to a desired configuration of high manipulability and avoiding arm joint limits. The performance of the hierarchical control law, with and without activation of each of the tasks, is shown in simulations and in real experiments confirming the viability of such prioritized control scheme for aerial manipulation. \u00c2\u00a9 1996-2012 IEEE.",

      "abstract": "An unmanned surface vehicle (USV) is operated on the water surface for specific purposes. USV can be used in waters that cannot be entered by crewed boats, such as environments with high levels of threat or that are contaminated by nuclear, biological, or chemical waste. USVs can also be used for surveys in shallow waters, escorting military weapons, collecting environmental data, and coordinating with other underwater vehicles such as automated underwater vehicles. This study designs and develops simple USV rockets for maneuvering on the water surface. First, a simple USV system is designed. Next, mechanical and electronic components are selected, and the control program is implemented using the Arduino Mega 2560 microcontroller. Finally, the USV motion kinematics are analyzed, rocket thrust force is tested, and torque generated by the electric ducted fan (EDF) motor is measured. Ultimately, a rocket system with weight of 3920 g and length, width, and height of 720 mm, 500 mm, and 420 mm, respectively, is developed. The USV rocket is driven by an EDF motor with voltage and current of 1600 kV and 160 A, respectively, an electronic speed control, 6X Turnigy FHSS remote control, and two 18.5 V Li-Po 5500 mAh batteries as a power source. The USV has a maximum thrust of 40.7 N with torque of 1.41 Nm. Kinematics parameters such as angular acceleration and linear acceleration were also determined. \u00c2\u00a9 IJTech 2017.",

We focus on the particular problem of (automatic) UAV positioning, which is known to crucially affect performance. Existing methods typically rely on statistical models of the air-to-ground channel, and thus, they fail to exploit the fine-grained information of line-of-sight (LOS) conditions at some locations. This paper develops an efficient algorithm to find the best position of the UAV based on the fine-grained LOS information. In spite of the complex terrain topology, the algorithm is able to converge to the optimal UAV position to maximize the end-to-end throughput without a global exploration of a signal strength radio map. Numerical results demonstrate that in a dense urban area, the UAV-aided wireless system with the optimal UAV position can almost double the end-to-end capacity from the base station (BS) to the user as compared to that of a direct BS to user link. \u00c2\u00a9 2017 IEEE.",

      "abstract": "Reliability and safety are extremely important for autonomous driving in real traffic scenarios. However, due to imperfect control and sensing, the actual state of the vehicle cannot be flawlessly predicted or measured, but estimated with uncertainty. Therefor, it is important to consider the execution risk advance in motion planning for a solution with a high success rate. The Space Exploration Guided Heuristic Search (SEHS) method is extended to deal with perception and control uncertainty in its two planning stages. First, the localization uncertainty is evaluated with a simple probabilistic robot model by the Space Exploration to find a path corridor with sufficient localization quality for the desired motion accuracy. Then, a trajectory controller is modeled with nonholonomic kinematics for the belief propagation of a robot state with primitive motions. The dynamic model and the control feedback are approximated in a close neighborhood of the reference trajectory. In this case, the Heuristic Search can propagate the state uncertainty as a normal distribution in the search tree to guarantee a high probability of safety and to achieve the required final accuracy. The belief-based SEHS is evaluated in several simulated scenarios. Compared to the basic SEHS method that assumes perfection, motions with higher execution successful rate are produced, especially the human-like behaviors for driving through narrow passages and precise parking. This confirms the major contribution of this work in exploiting the uncertainties for motion planning in autonomous driving. \u00c2\u00a9 2017 IEEE.",

By assuming that the UAV adopts the energy-efficient circular trajectory and employs time-division duplexing (TDD) based decode-and-forward (DF) relaying, we maximize the spectrum efficiency (SE) in bits/second/Hz as well as energy efficiency (EE) in bits/Joule of the considered system by jointly optimizing the time allocations for the UAV's relaying together with its flying speed and trajectory. It is revealed that for UAV-enabled mobile relaying with the UAV propulsion energy consumption taken into account, there exists a trade-off between the maximum achievable SE and EE by exploiting the new degree of freedom of UAV trajectory design. \u00c2\u00a9 2017 IEEE.",

      "abstract": "This paper addresses safety indicators for truck platooning at short inter-vehicle distances (with a time gap of 0.5 s). The aim of a safety indicator is to determine the correct moment for initiating a Collision Avoidance brake action to prevent a collision with the preceding truck in threatening situations. Three safety indicators are selected for an evaluation: The intended acceleration of the preceding truck, which is shared via Vehicle-To-Vehicle (V2V) communication, the Brake Threat Number (BTN-based on simple vehicle models and an emergency brake assumption of the lead), and the Time-To-Collision (TTC-based on a constant velocity assumption). The latter two do not rely on V2V communication, but are obtained via on-board signals. Requirements for the amount of false negatives (missing a threatening situation) and the false positives (identifying a safe situation as threatening) are derived from a functional safety perspective. To find thresholds for the safety indicators that minimize the false negative rate, emergency brake tests are used. To evaluate the number of false positives, a set of data of two trucks driving in a platoon at 0.5 s at mixed-Traffic highways in Belgium and the Netherlands, collected during 8 hours of automated driving in a platoon, is used. The results indicate that the communicated intended acceleration of the preceding truck might be able to distinguish safe and threatening situations in a vehicle platoon. Furthermore, for situations without V2V, both the BTN and the TTC are not capable to distinguish between threatening and safe situations. The amount of false positives found in the safe driving data-set does not fulfill the requirements derived from functional safety perspective. \u00c2\u00a9 2017 IEEE.",

      "abstract": "The advancement in Autonomous Vehicles (AVs) has created an enormous market for the development of self-driving functionalities, raising the question of how it will transform the traditional vehicle development process. One adventurous proposal is to open the AV platform to third-party developers, so that AV functionalities can be developed in a crowd-sourcing way, which could provide tangible benefits to both automakers and end users. Some pioneering companies in the automotive industry have made the move to open the platform so that developers are allowed to test their code on the road. Such openness, however, brings serious security and safety issues by allowing untrusted code to run on the vehicle. In this paper, we introduce the concept of an Appified AV platform that opens the development framework to third-party developers. To further address the safety challenges, we propose an enhanced appified AV design schema called AVGUARD, which focuses primarily on mitigating the threats brought about by untrusted code, leveraging theory in the vehicle evaluation field, and conducting program analysis techniques in the cyber security area. Our study provides guidelines and suggested practice for the future design of open AV platforms. \u00c2\u00a9 2017 IEEE.",

      "abstract": "Providing high-speed communication for mobile users in remote geographic areas or after a disaster occurs is not only critical but also challenging. To counter such challenge, unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) have been exploited to provide a fast-deployable and high-speed communication system, where each UAV can serve as an aerial small cell base station to provide WiFi and/or cellular services for the ground users. Despite its fast-deployable and highly maneuverable features, the capacity analysis of aerial small cells is largely missing. To close such gap, a stochastic propagation model for A-to-G aerial channels is first introduced, which takes into account the impact from wave propagation, gaseous absorption, Doppler spread, attitude-dependent shadowing, and multipath fading. Then, by exploiting such model, the area spectral efficiency of the aerial small cells is investigated for both SISO and MIMO cases.

      "abstract": "Micro unmanned aerial vehicles (MUAVs) have attracted much interest as flexible communication means for multiple applications due to their versatility. Most of the MUAV-based applications require a time-limited access to the spectrum to complete data transmission due to limited battery capacity of the flying units. These characteristics are the origin of two main challenges faced by MUAV-based communication: 1) efficient-energy management, and 2) opportunistic spectrum access. This paper proposes an energy-efficient solution, considering the hover and communication energy, to address these issues by integrating cognitive radio (CR) technology with MUAVs. A non-convex optimization problem exploiting the mobility of MUAVs is developed for the underlay CR technique. The objective is to determine an optimized three-dimension (3D) location, for a secondary MUAV, at which it can complete its data transfer with minimum energy consumption and without harming the data rate requirement of the primary spectrum owner. Two algorithms are proposed to solve these optimization problems: a meta-heuristic particle swarm optimization algorithm (PSO) and a deterministic algorithm based on Weber formulation. Selected numerical results show the behavior of the MUAV versus various system parameters and that the proposed solutions achieve very close results in spite of the different conceptional constructions. \u00c2\u00a9 2017 IEEE.",

In this paper, we propose to spatially partition the motion planning by longitudinal and lateral motions along the rough reference path in the Fren\u00c3\u00a9t Frame, which makes it possible to create linearized safety constraints for each layer in a variety of on-road driving scenarios. A generic environmental representation methodology is proposed with three topological elements and corresponding longitudinal constraints to compose all driving scenarios mentioned in this paper according to the overlap between the potential path of the autonomous vehicle and predicted path of other road users. Planners combining A search and quadratic programming (QP) are designed to plan both rough long-Term longitudinal motions and short-Term trajectories to exploit the advantages of both search-based and optimization-based methods. Limits of vehicle kinematics and dynamics are considered in the planners to handle extreme cases. Simulation results show that the proposed framework can plan collision-free motions with high driving quality under complicated scenarios and emergency situations. \u00c2\u00a9 2017 IEEE.",

      "abstract": "The use of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) as delivery systems of online goods is rapidly becoming a global norm, as corroborated by Amazon's 'Prime Air' and Google's 'Project Wing' projects. However, the real-world deployment of such drone delivery systems faces many cyber-physical security challenges. In this paper, a novel mathematical framework for analyzing and enhancing the security of drone delivery systems is introduced. In this regard, a zero-sum network interdiction game is formulated between a vendor, operating a drone delivery system, and a malicious attacker. In this game, the vendor seeks to find the optimal path that its UAV should follow, to deliver a purchase from the vendor's warehouse to a customer location, to minimize the delivery time. Meanwhile, an attacker seeks to choose an optimal location to interdict the potential paths of the UAVs, so as to inflict cyber or physical damage to it, thus, maximizing its delivery time. First, the Nash equilibrium point of this game is characterized. Then, to capture the subjective behavior of both the vendor and attacker, new notions from prospect theory are incorporated into the game. These notions allow capturing the vendor's and attacker's i) subjective perception of attack success probabilities, and ii) their disparate subjective valuations of the achieved delivery times relative to a certain target delivery time. Simulation results have shown that the subjective decision making of the vendor and attacker leads to adopting risky path selection strategies which inflict delays to the delivery, thus, yielding unexpected delivery times which surpass the target delivery time set by the vendor. \u00c2\u00a9 2017 IEEE.",

The coupling exploits the comprehensive capabilities of the simulators at a reasonable computational complexity and allows simulating CAD systems with high accuracy. We demonstrate the capabilities of the simulation tool by a case study of convoy driving with automated vehicles using a fully distributed control algorithm and IVC.

Unfortunately, this goal is hard to achieve due the need for coordination and the limited flight autonomy of the SUAVs. In this paper, we investigate how to guarantee persistent coverage of a target area through SUAVs by exploiting characteristics of fixed terrestrial infrastructure and inherent energy limitations. This paper makes three main contributions. First, the problem of SUAV activity scheduling is formulated for pre-existing fixed placements, and centrally solved to maximize the network lifetime given a target coverage ratio. Second, a distributed, bio-inspired algorithm is devised using local (1-hop) communication only, i.e., the scheme takes into account both positioning and charging issues allowing the SUAVs to self-organize into a maximum-coverage connected swarm, and coordinate the charging operations. Third, the performance of the distributed scheme is compared to the optimal solution, and the impact of the system parameters like the placement height and the discharging rate on the coverage metrics is discussed. \u00c2\u00a9 2017 IEEE.",

In order to feed the UAV's autonomous path planning and positioning algorithm, a radio map is exploited, which must be, in practice, reconstructed from UAV-based measurements from a limited subset of locations. Unlike existing methods that ignore the segmented propagation structure of the radio map, this paper proposes a machine learning approach to reconstruct a finely structured map by exploiting both segmentation and signal strength models. A data clustering and parameter estimation problem is formulated using a maximum likelihood approach, and solved by an iterative clustering and regression algorithm. Numerical results demonstrate significant performance advantage in radio map reconstruction as compared to the baseline. \u00c2\u00a9 2017 IEEE.",

Under the hierarchical control framework, the position and attitude loop controls are developed in sequence based on adaptive sliding mode control schemes. Initially, using the saturation property of the hyperbolic tangent function, a position loop controller is synthesised, and a criterion for choosing control parameters is established to guarantee the singularity-free command attitude extraction. Then, in the attitude loop, to avoid singularity which occurs when the pitch reaches (Formula presented.), a novel sliding mode surface is introduced, and an attitude control project with the associated initial condition constraint is put forward. In addition, adaptive algorithms are developed to estimate and compensate the uncertainties arising from unknown inertial parameters, thrust and torque faults and undesired disturbances. It is demonstrated in terms of Lyapunov theorem that, with the proposed controller, the closed-loop position and attitude error subsystems of the VTOL UAV are asymptotically stable, respectively. Eventually, simulations validate the tracking performance of the controller. \u00c2\u00a9 2017 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.",

In addition, Flying Ad hoc Networks (FANETs), ad-hoc networks for Unmanned Aircraft System (UAS), increase the coverage and ability to transmit/receive data in an extended range. For these reasons, a UAS promise new application areas for military and specific missions, such as search and rescue operations, target detection and attacks. However, due to three dimensional mobility with high speed and dynamic topology changes of UAVs in the air, a stable connection between UAV and Ground Control Station (GCS) for data exchange in ad-hoc mode is one of the biggest issues in FANET. The energy consumption is also an important issue, which ensures sufficient flight time of UAVs to perform assigned missions from a GCS. In this paper, we introduce the cluster head selection algorithms for FANET to achieve stable connection of UAS and reduction of energy consumption. Finally, the cluster head selection techniques which are suitable for mission-oriented FANET environments are discussed. \u00c2\u00a9 2017 IEEE.",

With the aid of a special thermal camera image preprocessing algorithm the contrast could be enhanced by 10 to 50% which improves the detectability of nests. We successfully demonstrated, that we detected 93% of the known nests. This paper describes and analyzes the necessary conditions for optimal lapwing nest detection with a UAV borne thermal camera. \u00c2\u00a9 2017 IEEE.",

The proposed moving pattern also creates a safe area into which no target is able to intrude. The Progressively Spiral Out (PSO) path is developed to describe the proposed moving pattern, which can be applied to any number of UAVs. It also shows that the radius of the resulting non-intrusive defensible border grows proportionally to the number of UAVs. The performance of the proposed PSO path is tested against a baseline raster path in simulation. The simulation results show that the PSO path outperforms the baseline path on both time to detection and successful rate of defending attacks toward the non-intrusive region. \u00c2\u00a9 2017 IEEE.",

The aerial vehicle chosen for validating this safe-control-scheme is the quadcopter vehicle. The user will use a bracelet composed by inertial (gyroscopes, accelerometers and magnetometers) and electromyographic sensors that will measure the arm user movements and construe them in references for the drone. In order to achieve this, the data acquired from the bracelet has to undergo a signal treatment and safety algorithms were put in place. A method for gesture recognition was developed in order to fully exploit the capabilities of both, the user and the UAV - Unmanned Aerial Vehicle. Data collection and analysis were performed to improve the algorithms. Experimental tests with real time flight were performed to validate the proposed safe- control-scheme. Main graphs illustrate the satisfactory results obtained when controlling the quadcopter vehicle in acrobatic maneuvers. \u00c2\u00a9 2017 IEEE.",

In this paper, we exploit recent work on the characterisation of vision-based aircraft detection problems in the sky-region to propose an adaptive threshold selection approach. Using data sets captured during flight experiments, we show that our proposed adaptive threshold approach can enable improved detection range performance compared to manually selected static thresholds. \u00c2\u00a9 2017 IEEE.",

With the advancement in technologies and applications involving unmanned aerial systems, an efficient autonomous aerial interdiction mission has been identified in literature as one of the pivotal elements. Effective interdiction usually requires a group of pursuers (as opposed to a single one), which enables achieving a certain formation around the target restricting its further maneuver. This paper presents a coordinated trajectory-shaping guidance strategy for a group of two autonomous pursuers, which can easily be generalized for a multi-pursuer case. Specific challenges in the group maneuvering include coordinated control of the arrival time and final relative attitude. The paper develops the corresponding algorithms and demonstrates their effectiveness in a set of computer simulations featuring different engagement geometries. It also addresses feasibility of obtained solutions from the standpoint of their applicability on board of a small unmanned aerial vehicle with a limited computational capability. \u00c2\u00a9 2017 IEEE.",

      "abstract": "A number of autonomous unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV) are tasked to search an unknown/uncertain environment, and neutralize targets whenever they come across such threats. Due to resource constraints of the UAVs, neutralizing some threats require simultaneous effort of a certain number of UAVs in minimum. When a UAV detects multiple such targets which require team efforts, it needs to communicate with its neighbour UAVs asking for their cooperation to form colaitions to neutralize the targets. Since the involved entities are dynamic in nature, a UAV may have to terminate information exchange with its neighbours within a few iterative steps so that the decision making process can be finished before any topological change takes place. Moreover, due to sensor range and communication bandwidth limitations, a UAV cannot know about other tasks available to its neighbours in an instantaneous manner. Through communication, UAVs can learn correspondence between their own utilities and utilities of the neighbour UAVs to different joint action profiles, but not the decisions of other UAVs. We formulate the problem that a UAV faces when it detects multiple such targets and needs to decide as to which target it should try to neutralize, given the uncertainty over the decisions of its neighbour UAVs, in a game theoretic framework. We propose a correlated equilibrium concept based decentralized game theoretic solution that requires local information of the UAVs. \u00c2\u00a9 2017 IEEE.",

      "abstract": "This paper proposes the concept of drones capable of functioning as 'Co-Archaeologists' that can map large caves and enter dangerous or hard-to-reach spaces. Using RGB-D data collected by drones, we will be able to produce accurate 3D models and semantic maps with proper lighting co-supervised by human archaeologists. This is going to be a major advance in archaeological practice, which can accelerate the speed of archaeological exploits by extending the archaeologists' sight and perception range. This will enable us to conduct 3D analyses so that we may answer new questions and create new insights into the archaeological record. The archaeologists will be able to visualize data collected by drones and instruct the drones' next step in real-time. These data will also be important in site management, data sharing and visualization. Human/drone interaction becomes important, not only for operating the equipment, but also for guiding drones to areas of interest to be mapped. Maps or real-time 'fly-throughs' only make sense when they are organized by human interactions with the space. This human interaction is vital when visualizing and understanding a space and should be reflected in the imagery. We envision that this technology will be game changing in cave mapping and pertinent to anyone rendering interior spaces. It creates longer term impacts in archaeology and digital heritage and potentially creates a transformative way for further enhancing the performance of 3D mapping. \u00c2\u00a9 2017 IEEE.",

      "abstract": "In order to further expand the sustainability of maritime operations the use of autonomous vehicles has been employed at an increasing scale. This natural increase comes not only in the form of the multiplication of the numbers of the same vehicle model, but also in diversifying the vehicle composition setup in order to allow the exploitation of different types of payloads. Moreover, this use of heterogeneous multi-vehicle teams allows overcoming individual limitations that one specific vehicle model might have. Nevertheless, this increase in scale and functionality also causes an increase in control, management, and spatial and operational complexity. This complexity is addressed in the framework of the LSTS Neptus-IMC-Dune software toolchain. The software toolchain is a framework for mixed-initiative control (humans in the planning and control loops) of unmanned ocean and air vehicles operating in communications challenged environments with support for Disruptive Tolerant Networking (DTN) protocols. The use of such a toolchain has allowed for repeated and successful deployments of heterogeneous multi-vehicle teams. The paper reports these deployments together with an in-depth description of the toolchain. \u00c2\u00a9 2017 IEEE.",

The process of generating such trajectories consists of the identification of the wind field and the different wind features such as gusts and/or wind shear in order to generate on a waypoint-to-waypoint basis trajectories that increase the efficiency. The paper presents a method to generate smooth trajectories that prioritize the wind energy harvesting for different cases of wind fields. The algorithm for curve generation is a tridiagonal system of linear equations with slope unitary vector, tension and velocity function parameters in order to determine the spline direction at each node. The unitary direction is adjusted for each node to harvest wind energy and also the tension parameters can be determined to adjust the curvature and its rate of change, so that they can be aligned with the dynamic specification of the UAS. Simulations and results are presented in order to demonstrate the performance of the proposed methods showing dramatic airspeed gains for cases in which the wind vector is considered as an input of the curve parametrization. \u00c2\u00a9 2017 IEEE.",

Each arm provides three degrees of freedom (DOF) for positioning the end-effector, and two DOF for orientation. As most model-based controllers assume that joint torque feedback is available, a torque estimator for the arms is developed. Note that low cost servos used for building low weight manipulators do not provide any torque feedback or control capability. The redundant DOFs in the dual arm prototype are exploited for generating coordinated motions during contact-less phases in such a way that reaction torques can be partially canceled. Preliminary flight tests have been conducted in outdoors, evaluating the torque compensation capability in test-bench. The influence of the reaction torques exerted by the arms over the UAV controller is also analyzed in simulation. \u00c2\u00a9 2017 IEEE.",

Visual-based detection methods have been proposed since their maintenance costs are typically lower. However, visual based detection methods in existing systems are not robust due to varying light intensities, occlusions, and their deployment costs can still be expensive. In this paper, we present a collaborative UAV aided smart parking solution where a small team of low cost UAVs are used to collaboratively identify free parking spots of parking lots within campuses. We design a novel navigation control scheme to allow such UAVs to avoid obstacles and cover the parking lots sufficiently. In addition, we also present a visual detection scheme using the generative adversarial network (GAN) which allows us to predict parking availability without requiring pre-identification of parking spots. Simulation results indicate that our approach show promising results. \u00c2\u00a9 2017 IEEE.",

      "abstract": "Small consumer unmanned aircraft systems (sUASs) have been involved in many security incidents recently. Current defense methods have serious limitations because they mostly try to physically capture an sUAS or jam its communications and its GPS signals to trigger its fail-safe features. While physical methods are usually unscalable and often slow in response, the default fail-safe features can be easily changed to other options such as continuing its pre-configured mission, regardless of jamming. Therefore, new defense solutions must be developed to address these issues. To our best knowledge, very little research has been published in this area. In this paper, we propose a false data injection attack to exploit the limitation of sensoring and processing capabilities on an sUAS and manipulate its on-board sensors, in order to deviate it from its (pre-configured) flight plan. We have analyzed the popular ArduPilot flight control system, identified potential vulnerabilities in its sensor data fusion process, and developed a method to manipulate on-board magnetometer readings while avoiding being detected by its bad-data detection schemes. Our initial results show that the proposed method is able to misguide the navigation system and deviate an sUAS from its target destination far away. While we present our main ideas in this paper, we are further investigating related theoretical issues and improving the proposed method with practical experimental tests. \u00c2\u00a9 2017 IEEE.",

      "abstract": "The wide use of the Global Positioning System (GPS) for navigation has been persistent for a long time. However, in today's scenario when technologies are advancing the accuracy of positioning systems, there are various new threats and challenges emerging. The signal receivers for positioning systems are prone to spoofing. This external interference in the system is usually done by feeding false signals to the receiver. Though the dead reckoning method is still in use, any interference with GPS can still lead to disaster. Insects and birds are known to use solar position for guidance and it is widely accepted by researchers that some birds, such as pigeons, use solar position in their homing flight. There are similar studies performed on honeybees and monarch butterflies. The use of solar position by these insects and birds brings up the question of whether a mathematical model can be used to replicate the results for aircraft navigation, and can a bio-inspired navigation algorithm like this be implemented? Solar position algorithms are already in wide use. The solar position algorithms available calculate the azimuth and zenith/incidence angles for the solar position at any given point of time when the position of the observer is known. The objective for navigation is to find an observer's position from solar position to present an alternative to GPS for navigational use. This document proposes a method for calculating the observer's position when the azimuth and zenith/incidence angles for solar position, attitude of aircraft and time are known. The approach proposed is that the position of the observer can be calculated by reversing the ENEA algorithm where instead of calculating the solar position using an observer's position, one will be calculating the position of the observer from solar position and time. The study includes the comparison of the calculated position of a UAS using the proposed method with the onboard GPS readings for both the ideal and the mimicked sensor accuracies for the position of the sun. \u00c2\u00a9 2017 IEEE.",

      "abstract": "This paper investigates the problems of task assignment and trajectory planning for teams of cooperative unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs). A novel approach of hierarchical fuzzy logic controller (HFLC) and particle swarm optimization is proposed. Initially, teams of UAVs are moving in a pre-determined formation covering a specified area. When one or more targets are detected, the teams send a package of information to the ground station (GS) including the target's degree of threat, degree of importance, and the separating distance between each team and each detected target. First, the ground station assigns the teams to the targets based on the gathered information. HFLC is implemented in the GS to solve the assignment problem ensuring that each team is assigned to a unique target. Then, each team plans its own path by formulating the path planning problem as an optimization problem, while the objective is to minimize the time to reach their destination considering the UAVs dynamic constraints and the collision avoidance between teams. A hybrid approach of control parametrization and time discretization (CPTD) and PSO is proposed to solve the optimization problem. Finally, numerical simulations demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm. \u00c2\u00a9 2017 IEEE.",

      "abstract": "Common open-source flight controllers have the ability to log state data, but they often are unable to log at the rates required to obtain good identification of model characteristics. They are also often unable to log important flow parameters such as angle-of-attack and sideslip angle. This paper presents a custom flight test instrumentation system that is capable of providing accurate full-state and control surface deflection measurements for Small Unmanned Air Systems. The system consists of an embedded single-board computer integrated with a collection of sensors including commercial off-the-shelf air data and inertial navigation systems, in addition to direct measurement of control deflections. Developmental Flight Test Instrumentation data logging software runs onboard the computer. This software is released as open-source. Performance of the system is verified by flight test on a quarter scale Piper PA-18 Super Cub airframe. The Observer/Kalman Identification algorithm is used in post-processing to generate linear statespace models, which are then simulated with other input sets and compared to flight data. Results presented in the paper demonstrate that the integrated flight test instrumentation system is able to provide sufficiently accurate data at a high enough sample rate for the generation of quality linear state-space models. \u00c2\u00a9 2017 IEEE.",

      "abstract": "Maritime Situational Awareness is crucial in maritime operations to identify threats and to deal with them as soon as possible. These threats can be pirates in shipping operations, icebergs when sailing in the northern sea routes, or even unknown vessels or objects that might be on the ship's path. A solution to identify these threats is the use of UAV's to overfly the ship's planned path. This solution is described in this paper, using an autonomous fixed wing UAV. Based on the provided ship's planned path, the UAV should autonomously map the area close to the ship track. To do that, an optimization problem is solved using Model Predictive Control, where the turn rate for the next time period is optimized. Based on the turn rate, the future path of the UAV is calculated and the waypoints are sent to the autopilot. This application is thoroughly tested using a Software In Loop environment, where an aircraft model is used with the autopilot's simulation. The results show that surveillance performance is improved if the UAV has information about the ship's velocity in addition to position. \u00c2\u00a9 2017 IEEE.",

The network composed exclusively by these aircraft is known as Flying Ad hoc Network (FANET), a new ad hoc fashion network with new challenges to be faced. Applications running on a FANET eventually require the use of security mechanisms. To verify which one is the most appropriate for embedded systems like those used in such autonomous aircraft, it is necessary to carry out a study about the cryptographic methods in these platforms. In this paper, we have added the symmetric-key algorithm AES (Advanced Encryption Standard) to three broadcast mitigation algorithms experimented in our previous work. The purpose is to guarantee confidentiality when exchanging messages and avoid an attacker to ruin the broadcast control strategies, what would let the network susceptible to the broadcast storm problem. We have performed outdoor experiments using an embedded platform and the results are analyzed in this paper and compared with the ones of the previous work, in which cryptography was not employed. Results show that a strong symmetric-key encryption did not significantly influenced the performance of the mitigation algorithms and can be applied to these systems without performance penalty. \u00c2\u00a9 2017 IEEE.",

      "abstract": "One important aspect that needs to be carefully considered in maritime operations using unmanned robotic vehicles is the communication restrictions between the vehicles and the mission controller that arises mainly due to long distances and/or low power transmissions. This paper addresses the problem of maintaining a communication link between a command station and an Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) with limited communication range during maritime operations. The proposed scheme uses an additional UAV that acts as a relay for the communication between the command station and the UAV in mission and is actively driven to maintain a desired Quality-of-Service (QoS) level, defined in this paper. Exploiting this architecture, it is possible to plan a maritime operation for a robotic vehicle without the need of considering vehicle-to-command-station communication constraints that will be satisfied by the introduction of the extra autonomous relay-UAVs. To this end, we propose a feedback strategy that has the dual task of commanding and optimizing the execution of the relay UAV motion tasks and adapting the scheduler algorithm according to a desired QoS level. The performance of the proposed strategy is illustrated through computer simulations and preliminary experimental results. \u00c2\u00a9 2017 IEEE.",

They are being engaged in many types of missions, ranging from military to agriculture passing by entertainment and rescue or even delivery. Nonetheless, for being able to perform such tasks, UAVs have to navigate safely in an often dynamic and partly unknown environment. This brings many challenges to overcome, some of which can lead to damages or degradations of different body parts. Thus, new tools and methods are required to allow the successful analysis and identification of the different threats that UAVs have to manage during their missions or flights. Various approaches, addressing this domain, have been proposed. However, most of them typically identify the changes in the UAVs behavior rather than the issue. This work presents an approach, which focuses not only on identifying degradations of UAVs during flights, but estimate the source of the failure as well. \u00c2\u00a9 2017 IEEE.",

      "abstract": "While operating any aircraft it is vital to know its current flight state. Some of the most important variables to assess the flight state are the airspeed, the angle of attack and the sideslip angle. Larger aircraft are equipped with sensors specifically designed to measure these variables. However on small unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) much stricter restrictions on size, weight and cost prohibit the use of such sensors. Therefore we propose a method to estimate the airflow variables utilizing only sensors that are part of a standard UAV autopilot. This includes an inertial measurement unit (IMU), a global navigation satellite system (GNSS) receiver and a pitot-static tube. These measurement together with kinematic and aerodynamic models will be fused within an estimator to estimate steady and turbulent wind velocities as well as aerodynamic coefficients. With these estimates it is possible to calculate the angle of attack, the sideslip angle and the airspeed. A main challenge is to distinguish between changes in the aerodynamic coefficients and changes in wind velocity, since pitot-static tube measurements of the relative airspeed are only available in one direction at a time and hence the system is not always observable. Therefore attitude changes have to be undertaken to achieve persistence of excitation. In this paper a Moving Horizon Estimator (MHE) is used for estimation. Simulation results show overall good estimation results and significant improvements compared to a previous Extended Kalman Filter approach. Root mean square errors (RMSE) are 0.25\u00c2\u00b0 for the angle of attack, 0.08m/s for the airspeed and 1.06\u00c2\u00b0 for the side slip estimates. \u00c2\u00a9 2017 IEEE.",

      "abstract": "Characterizing membrane dynamics is a key issue to understand cell exchanges with the extra-cellular medium. Total internal reflection fluorescence microscopy (TIRFM) is well suited to focus on the late steps of exocytosis at the plasma membrane. However, it is still a challenging task to quantify (lateral) diffusion and estimate local dynamics of proteins. A new model was introduced to represent the behavior of cargo transmembrane proteins during the vesicle fusion to the plasma membrane at the end of the exocytosis process. Two biophysical parameters, the diffusion coefficient and the release rate parameter, are automatically estimated from TIRFM image sequences, to account for both the lateral diffusion of molecules at the membrane and the continuous release of the proteins from the vesicle to the plasma membrane. Quantitative evaluation on 300 realistic computer-generated image sequences demonstrated the efficiency and accuracy of the method. The application of our method on 16 real TIRFM image sequences additionally revealed differences in the dynamic behavior of Transferrin Receptor (TfR) and Langerin proteins. An automated method has been designed to simultaneously estimate the diffusion coefficient and the release rate for each individual vesicle fusion event at the plasma membrane in TIRFM image sequences. It can be exploited for further deciphering cell membrane dynamics.",

      "abstract": "It is natural for humans to work with abstract plans which are often an intuitive and concise way to represent a task. However, high level task descriptions contain symbols and concepts which need to be grounded within the environment if the plan is to be executed by an autonomous robot. The problem of learning the mapping between abstract plan symbols and their physical instances in the environment is known as the problem of physical symbol grounding. In this paper, we propose a framework for Grounding and Learning Instances through Demonstration and Eye tracking (GLIDE). We associate traces of task demonstration to a sequence of fixations which we call fixation programs and exploit their properties in order to perform physical symbol grounding. We formulate the problem as a probabilistic generative model and present an algorithm for computationally feasible inference over the proposed model. A key aspect of our work is that we estimate fixation locations within the environment which enables the appearance of symbol instances to be learnt. Instance learning is a crucial ability when the robot does not have any knowledge about the model or the appearance of the symbols referred to in the plan instructions. We have conducted human experiments and demonstrate that GLIDE successfully grounds plan symbols and learns the appearance of their instances, thus enabling robots to autonomously execute tasks in initially unknown environments. \u00c2\u00a9 2017 IEEE.",

      "abstract": "Sensing of mechanical stimuli forms an important communication pathway between humans/environment and machines. The progress in such sensing technology has possible impacts on the functioning of automated systems, human machine interfacing, health-care monitoring, prosthetics and safety systems. The challenges in this field range from attaining high sensitivity to extreme robustness. In this article, sensing of complex mechanical stimuli with a patch of taped crumpled reduced graphene oxide (rGO) has been reported which can typically be assembled under household conditions. The ability of this sensor to detect a wide variety of pressures and strains in conventional day-to-day applications has been demonstrated. An extremely high gauge factor (\u00e2\u0088\u00bc103) at ultralow strains (\u00e2\u0088\u00bc10-4) with fast response times (<20.4 ms) could be achieved with such sensors. Pressure resulting from a gentle touch to over human body weight could be sensed successfully. The capability of the sensor to respond in a variety of environments could be exploited in the detection of water and air pressures both below and above atmospheric, with a single device. \u00c2\u00a9 2017 The Royal Society of Chemistry.",

      "abstract": "Dense depth map estimation from stereo cameras has many applications in robotic vision, e.g., obstacle detection, especially when performed in real-time. The range in which depth values can be accurately estimated is usually limited for two-camera stereo setups due to the fixed baseline between the cameras. In addition, two-camera setups suffer from wrong depth estimates caused by local minima in the matching cost functions. Both problems can be alleviated by adding more cameras as this creates multiple baselines of different lengths and since multi-image matching leads to unique minima. However, using more cameras usually comes at an increase in run-time. In this paper, we present a novel embedded system for multi-baseline stereo. By exploiting the parallelization capabilities within FPGAs, we are able to estimate a depth map from multiple cameras in real-time. We show that our approach requires only little more power and weight compared to a two-camera stereo system. At the same time, we show that our system produces significantly better depth maps and is able to handle occlusion of some cameras, resulting in the redundancy typically desired for autonomous vehicles. Our system is small in size and leight-weight and can be employed even on a MAV platform with very strict power, weight, and size requirements. \u00c2\u00a9 2017 IEEE.",

      "abstract": "Marine robots and unmanned surface vehicles will increasingly be deployed in rivers and riverine environments. The structure produced by flowing waters may be exploited for purposes of estimation, planning, and control. This paper adopts a widely acknowledged model for the geometry of watercourse channels, namely sine-generated curves, as a basis for estimators that predict the shape of the yet unseen portion of the river. Predictions of this sort help a robot anticipate the future, for example, in throttling speeds as it rounds a bend. After examining how to reparameterize standard filters to incorporate this model, we compare the performance of three Gaussian filters and show that nonideality and theoretical challenges (of non-linearity, multi-modality/periodicity) degrade the performance of standard Kalman filters severely, but can be successfully mitigated by imposing an interval constraint. Thereafter, we present results of a constrained interval Kalman filter on data from three natural rivers. The results we report show the effectiveness of our method on the estimation of meander parameters. The results we report, including data from simulation, from maps, and from GPS tracks of a boat on the Colorado river, show the effectiveness of our method on the estimation of meander parameters. \u00c2\u00a9 2017 IEEE.",

      "abstract": "Internet of Things (IoT) serves not only as an essential part of the new generation information technology but as an important development stage in the information era. IoT devices such as unmanned aerial vehicles, robots and wearable equipments have been widely used in recent years. For most organizations' inner networks, innumerable dynamic connections with Internet accessible IoT devices occur at many parts all the time. It is usually these temporal links that arise potential threats to the security of the whole intranet. In this paper, we propose a new system named IoT Eye, which automatically discovers the IoT devices in real time. The IoT Eye detects all the potential IoT target hosts using an innovative two-stage architecture: (1) Scanning suspicious IP segments with stateless TCP SYN scan model and zero copy TCP stack; (2) Identifying each IoT device on various protocols using PI-AC, which is a novel high-performance multi-pattern matching algorithm. The preceding model ensures the IoT Eye searching each newly connected device out in rather small time delay, which minimizes the missing and wrong detection rates. Related intelligence on the active IoT devices linked with the organization's intranets are of great importance to the professionals. Since it can help them: (1) re-examine the borders of large intranets; (2) reduce non-essential device access; (3) fix security vulnerabilities timely. \u00c2\u00a9 2017 IEEE.",

An overall COMPA autonomic control loop can orchestrate functions, themselves implemented as COMPA autonomic loops.

One of the most exciting application areas for the COMPA automation pattern is in assuring mobile network security. The recursive nature of the pattern is the ideal mechanism for automating monitoring and root cause analysis of security threats to networks. In this paper we present a Proof of Concept of a COMPA compliant system for a Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) scenario. The system monitors, performs root cause analysis, and mitigates a DDoS attack. The system was built by integrating a number of existing components that were deployed as VNFs.

Also, it needs computational expensive calculations because of stereo matching. In real time applications, the execution time of stereo vision depth detection algorithm is very important. This paper studies the Intel SIMD instructions and CUDA effects on reducing the execution time of the stereo vision. CUDA and SIMD instructions improve performance by exploiting data level parallelism. We present a fast implementation of SSD stereo vision algorithm on Intel processors using SIMD instruction sets (SSE3 and AVX2) and NVIDIA Graphics Processing Unit (GPU) using CUDA language and compare their results with serial implementation. The algorithm applied to different ranges of disparity (from 16 to 256), window size (from 3\u00c3\u00973 to 15\u00c3\u009715) and image resolution (from 256\u00c3\u0097212 to 1408\u00c3\u00971168) parameters. We achieved 182 frames per second rate for the disparity of 64 and window size of 3\u00c3\u00973 in CUDA, 64 frames per second rate in AVX2 and 25 frames per second rate in SSE3. Experimental results show that we can get speedup up to 5\u00c3\u0097 in SSE3, 10\u00c3\u0097 in AVX2 and 21\u00c3\u0097 in CUDA compared to serial implementation. \u00c2\u00a9 2017 IEEE.",

      "abstract": "For human-driven as well as autonomous vehicles, one of the key requirements is continuous awareness of the surroundings to detect any potential threats (vehicles, pedestrians, wild-life etc.). This requires continuous cooperation between the vehicles by efficiently sharing safety information in a timely manner. However, this is a multi-dimensional and challenging problem due to the complex nature of the vehicular environment. To solve this problem, this paper proposes an elegant solution to efficiently share the safety information among vehicles by using only Basic Safety Messages (BSM), which are part of the existing V2V standards. Through this research, the vehicles are able to quickly and preemptively identify potential threats, not only in their close proximity, but also those which are further along the roadway by intelligently exchanging safety information between neighboring vehicles. Additionally, for the first time, the proposed architecture presents a practical approach of incorporating the onboard sensor data with the V2V communications. This leads to vehicles having improved visibility and situational awareness further outside of their one-hop coverage. Simulation results show that improved visibility of vehicles up to 2.6 km can be achieved while placing minimum overhead and complexity on the network. \u00c2\u00a9 2017 IEEE.",

      "abstract": "Actuator fault of a multicopter Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) may lead to a dangerous flight, and even damage the UAV. To ensure the flight safety in case of unpredictable actuator fault, many active fault tolerant control methods are studied in the last decade. An active fault tolerant method of a multicopter includes a fault detection, isolation and reconstruction (FDIR) scheme and a control allocation scheme. FDIR is of great importance for providing the estimation of the efficiency loss percentage. Previous FDIR procedures usually rely on an observer, which is complicated and computationally expensive. In this paper, we exploit the non-linear analytical redundancy techniques to provide a novel FDIR procedure, with a simple algorithm structure. We compare the isolation effectiveness and reconstruction performance of our approach and sliding mode observer based approach by a real experiment, respectively. It demonstrates that our approach shows a superiority of simpler algorithm structure and better fault reconstruction performance. \u00c2\u00a9 2017 IEEE.",

The sensitive nature of the data exchanged over these networks puts security aspects at the top of conceptual and implementation considerations. In fact this is due to the inherent WSN vulnerability issues that are caused by the hostile environments in which they are deployed. Moreover, limited energy and computing resources of connected wireless nodes add complexity to these issues. In this paper, we aim to describe the new challenges in securing data collection and exchange in WSN, by investigating major security threats and by presenting recent major research advances in this area, with a special focus on the specificities related to military applications. \u00c2\u00a9 2017 IEEE.",

      "abstract": "Quadrotors are becoming a major platform for both industrial and research activities, increasing the requirements for precise and dynamic control. Best control can be achieved by directly controlling the individual rotor thrust forces, which, during flight, can only be estimated. An identification of the thrust generation mechanism, and subsequent exploitation of this relation in the quadrotor's command chain is therefore crucial. In this work, the relationship between a given angular velocity command and actual thrust of each individual rotor is modeled as a Wiener model, consisting of a linear dynamic first-order plus time delay element and a static nonlinear second order polynomial. Parameters are identified experimentally using a propeller thrust scale and measurements of the true rotor speed. In addition, an inflight calibration procedure is proposed for compensation of varying system and environment parameters. The command structure is then implemented on a quadrotor employed with a flatness-based controller, and indoor flights in a tracking cell show a low mean error of 0.2 m/s2 between commanded and true acceleration. The simplicity and accuracy of this approach motivates the application to quadrotors with all kinds of controllers to increase their performance during dynamic maneuvers. \u00c2\u00a9 2017 IEEE.",

      "abstract": "The process of routing in Vehicular Ad hoc Networks (VANET) is a challenging task in city environments. Finding the shortest end-to-end connected path satisfying delay restriction and minimal overhead is confronted with many constraints and difficulties. Such difficulties are due to the high mobility of vehicles, the frequent path failures, and the various obstructions, which may affect the reliability of the data transmission and routing. Commercial Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) or what are commonly referred to as drones can come in handy in dealing with these constraints. In this paper, we study how UAVs operating in ad hoc mode can cooperate with VANET on the ground so as to assist in the routing process and improve the reliability of the data delivery by bridging the communication gap whenever it is possible. In a previous work, we have proposed UVAR \u00e2\u0080\u0093 a UAV-Assisted VANETs routing protocol, which improves data routing and connectivity of the vehicles on the ground through the use of UAVs. However, UVAR does not fully exploit UAVs in the sky for data forwarding because it uses UAVs only when the network is poorly dense. In this paper, we propose an extension of this protocol by supporting two different ways of routing data: (i) delivering data packets exclusively on the ground using UVAR-G; and (ii) transmitting data packets in the sky using a reactive routing based on UVAR-S. Simulation results demonstrate that the hybrid communication between vehicles and UAVs is ideally suited for VANETs compared to traditional vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) communications. \u00c2\u00a9 2017 Elsevier B.V.",

      "abstract": "Objective. Many computer vision and robotic applications require the implementation of robust and efficient target-tracking algorithms on a moving platform. However, deployment of a real-time system is challenging, even with the computational power of modern hardware. Lightweight and low-powered flying insects, such as dragonflies, track prey or conspecifics within cluttered natural environments, illustrating an efficient biological solution to the target-tracking problem. Approach. We used our recent recordings from 'small target motion detector' neurons in the dragonfly brain to inspire the development of a closed-loop target detection and tracking algorithm. This model exploits facilitation, a slow build-up of response to targets which move along long, continuous trajectories, as seen in our electrophysiological data. To test performance in real-world conditions, we implemented this model on a robotic platform that uses active pursuit strategies based on insect behaviour. Main results. Our robot performs robustly in closed-loop pursuit of targets, despite a range of challenging conditions used in our experiments; low contrast targets, heavily cluttered environments and the presence of distracters. We show that the facilitation stage boosts responses to targets moving along continuous trajectories, improving contrast sensitivity and detection of small moving targets against textured backgrounds. Moreover, the temporal properties of facilitation play a useful role in handling vibration of the robotic platform. We also show that the adoption of feed-forward models which predict the sensory consequences of self-movement can significantly improve target detection during saccadic movements. Significance. Our results provide insight into the neuronal mechanisms that underlie biological target detection and selection (from a moving platform), as well as highlight the effectiveness of our bio-inspired algorithm in an artificial visual system. \u00c2\u00a9 2017 IOP Publishing Ltd.",

      "abstract": "Development of Underwater Robotics is an important field of research and a promising industrial application since it represents a sustainable solution to exploit ocean resources with a reasonable environmental impact. To perform prolonged manipulation task, autonomous vehicles often suffer of insufficient autonomy while remotely operated vehicles despite to their performances are often limited by the complex management of umbilical link. For this reason, a new generation of hybrid underwater vehicles able to perform autonomously some tasks returning periodically to a docking station for recharge, vehicle and tooling reconfiguration is needed. In this work, a possible solution for a wireless recharging connection, able to drastically simplify recharge operations in underwater environment at abyssal depth (thousands of meter depth) is investigated. The paper presents some preliminary design and simulation proposal, along with a preliminary experimental validation of the adopted simulation tool on a toy test case. \u00c2\u00a9 2017 IEEE.",

      "abstract": "After disasters, communication infrastructures in disaster-affected areas may fail due to physical damages or power outages. Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) can act as flying base stations to satisfy the communication requirements of people in disaster-affected areas. For the purpose of increasing the data transmission rate and saving energy consumption of wireless telecommunication terminals (WTs), UAV mobility can be exploited to provide good channel conditions between UAVs and WTs. In this paper, a UAV with path length limitation is considered to provide communication service to WTs in a disaster area, a part of WTs can communicate with the UAV directly, and other WT communication with the UAV indirectly through D2D relay transmissions to reduce the UAV path length. Aiming at decreasing the total energy consumption of WTs, a novel UAV-aided data communicate method, ECO-UDC, is introduced. Extensive simulations demonstrate that ECO-UDC can reduce the energy consumption of WTs by approximately 30%-40% compared to the benchmark method. \u00c2\u00a9 2016 IEEE.",

      "abstract": "Embedded software is found everywhere from our highly visible mobile devices to the confines of our car in the form of smart sensors. Embedded software companies are under huge pressure to produce safe applications that limit risks, and testing is absolutely critical to alleviate concerns regarding safety and user privacy. This requires using large test suites throughout the development process, increasing time-to-market and ultimately hindering competitivity. Speeding up test execution is, therefore, of paramount importance for embedded software developers. This is traditionally achieved by running, in parallel, multiple tests on large-scale clusters of computers. However, this approach is costly in terms of infrastructure maintenance and energy consumed, and is at times inconvenient as developers have to wait for their tests to be scheduled on a shared resource. We propose to look at exploiting GPUs (Graphics Processing Units) for running embedded software testing. GPUs are readily available in most computers and offer tremendous amounts of parallelism, making them an ideal target for embedded software testing. In this paper, we demonstrate, for the first time, how test executions of embedded C programs can be automatically performed on a GPU, without involving the end user. We take a compiler-assisted approach which automatically compiles the C program into GPU kernels for parallel execution of the input tests. Using this technique, we achieve an average speedup of 16\u00c3\u0097when compared to CPU execution of input tests across nine programs from an industry standard embedded benchmark suite. \u00c2\u00a9 2017 Association for Computing Machinery.",

      "abstract": "Multipath Transport Control Protocol (MPTCP) has been originally proposed for the data centers. MPTCP aggregates multiple interfaces available at the end devices to provide improved throughput and reliability. These features of MPTCP can also be exploited in robotic and drone1 based communications. The biggest challenge observed in drone communication is the delay or failure in the reception of control signals due to congestion caused by high bandwidth video transmissions from drones to ground stations. Such delay in the control signals may cause unwanted misbehaviors at the drones. In this poster, we have proposed a new path scheduler for MPTCP which segregates the data and control packets intelligently. This not only guarantees the successful reception of control packets but also improves the average latency with increased reliability and resilience to link failures. We have implemented the proposed scheduler in the Linux kernel and observed its performance in a Robot Operating System (ROS)2 based drone environment. \u00c2\u00a9 2017 Copyright held by the owner/author(s).",

Prior work had shown the potential for the Meta-Search approach to evolve high performance micro for RTS games like StarCraft. We extend this work by moving to 3D and by moving to more realistic physics for simulating the movement of entities in our RTS-game-like simulation. We compare the evolved micro performance of our entities with different physics models of motion on the same scenarios against identical opponent units in a 3D RTS simulation. Results show that our genetic algorithm approach works to reliably evolve high quality 3D micro behaviors for entities independent of the physics model used. Furthermore, experiments show that the entity's acceleration has more of an effect on performance than rotation speed. Our work provides evidence for the generalizability of an evolutionary approach to generating complex behavior for 3D RTS games, training simulations, and real-world unmanned vehicles. \u00c2\u00a9 2017 IEEE.",

      "abstract": "Territorial surveillance plays a constantly increasing role in security. However, completely automatic surveillance using autonomous robots is hard to implement and maintain. Current methods described in literature propose systems that include direct communication of the robots or the use of a centralised system to coordinate the robots. These systems are prone to equipment failure and/or malicious attacks to the centralised system. In this paper, we propose a bioinspired algorithm that allows indirect communication between the robots that are considered minimally equipped. This is achieved by applying a parallel and distributed technique inspired by the emergent behaviour of social insects, namely ant colonies. In particular, the development of a collective memory for robots and areas covered is achieved subsequently through self-organisation of the autonomous robots to a continuous dynamic coverage of the test space. The algorithm is shown to have a robust behaviour and competitive performance. Several simulations run for various space sizes, different number of robots, different pheromone evaporation rates as well various percentages of space covered by obstacles. In all cases the efficacy of the proposed algorithm has been successfully proven when compared with other well known techniques. \u00c2\u00a9 2016 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.",

Urban transport disruptions therefore present a unique challenge and opportunity for planners and policy-makers to influence and shape outcomes for society. The role of urban planners and policy-makers in future transport systems will become increasingly important as mobility disruptions start to radically transform transport systems. Without sensible and informed public policy, future urban mobility disruptions have the potential to lead to a series of non-optimal outcomes, of which some may result in transport systems functioning worse than they do at present.

      "abstract": "With the wide proliferation of autonomous sense-And-control real-Time systems (such as robots and self-driven cars), a key research objective is rapid recovery from the effects of anomalies and impairments arising from performance degradation of sensors and actuators and electro-mechanical subsystems due to field wear and tear. This must be achieved with minimal impact on system performance while maintaining low implementation overhead and high coverage of multi-parameter failure mechanisms. In this work, we propose a reinforcement learning framework for on-line control law adaptation in autonomous nonlinear systems assisted by system state encodings. These encodings are exploited to generate time-varying error signals whose (transient) waveforms in relation to the input stimulus, contain root-cause diagnostic information. This establishes a statistical correlation between the transient waveforms and the parameters of the optimal nonlinear controller under arbitrary multi-parameter perturbations of sensor/actuator and subsystem performances. Consequently this correlation is tapped, using pre-deployment supervised learning algorithms, to predict near-optimal controller parameter values whenever sufficiently large parameter deviations are detected (due to non-zero error signals). From these near-optimal starting conditions, an actor-critic reinforcement learning controller for nonlinear systems quickly converges to the optimal control law for the parameter-perturbed system (up to 10\u00c3\u0097 faster than for systems not assisted by the diagnostic information provided by the state encoding driven error signal above). We implement the proposed methodology on two nonlinear systems demonstrating fast performance recovery in real time. \u00c2\u00a9 2017 IEEE.",

      "abstract": "Securing transmitted data from UAV to Base Station in high bit rate with maximum security needs Authenticated Encryption. New One Time Pad (OTP) algorithm was designed for high bit rate and high security level applications such as UAV Data Link. In this paper, the designed OTP algorithm is combined with Authenticated Encryption to ensure encryption and authentication along with data integrity. Authenticated Encryption (AE) is a very important technique that ensures complete security procedures of transported data. This technique combines encryption, authentication and data integrity to provide both privacy and authenticity of the data. In this paper, the design, analysis and simulation of a fast and enhanced stream cipher Authenticated Encryption architecture which is called Authenticated Encryption New OTP (AENOTP) is introduced on the basis of unpredictability concept. Unpredictability concept is a concept based on dynamic use of encryption algorithms, where instead of using single encryption algorithm for producing the ciphertext, multiple encryption algorithms are used in the same structure. The proposed algorithm is faster than ASC-1 authenticated encryption stream cipher with 60%. The proposed algorithm can resist different types of cryptanalysis attacks such as linear, differential, algebraic attacks and other types of attacks. \u00c2\u00a9 2017 IEEE.",

      "abstract": "Despite the significant advances in vehicle automation and electrification, the next-decade aspirations for massive deployments of autonomous electric mobility on demand (AEMoD) services are still threatened by two major bottlenecks, namely the computational and charging delays. This paper proposes a solution for these two challenges by suggesting the use of fog computing for AEMoD systems, and developing an optimized multi-class charging and dispatching scheme for its vehicles. A queuing model representing the proposed multiclass charging and dispatching scheme is first introduced. The stability conditions of this model and the number of classes that fit the charging capabilities of any given city zone are then derived. Decisions on the proportions of each class vehicles to partially/fully charge, or directly serve customers are then optimized using a stochastic linear program that minimizes the maximum response time of the system. Results show the merits of our proposed model and optimized decision scheme compared to both the always-charge and the equal split schemes. \u00c2\u00a9 2017 IEEE.",

This paper focuses on the design of a resilient end-to-end connectivity paradigm under unique architectural and scenario assumptions. First, the UAVs themselves are equipped with multiple interfaces that use standardized protocols, with associated variation in data throughout, range, and bit error rates. Second, there may be adversarial agents seeking to disrupt connectivity through targeted jamming in 3D spaces. Third, we assume an overlay software defined control plane, where the UAVs function as software switches, able to execute forwarding commands and determine preferred routes under controller directives. Our proposed approach devises metrics that influence the choice of the wireless interface and weights edges formed between UAV pairs. Further, it also uses a multi-layer graph model and creates maximally separated paths in 3D space to ensure resiliency to jamming. Simulation results conducted for urban scenarios reveal 34% improvement in enhanced resiliency for end-to-end outages by trading off 12% increase in latency over competing approaches. \u00c2\u00a9 2017 IEEE.",

In this paper, our validation efforts demonstrate that the OpenCV Histogram of Oriented Gradients (HOG) implementation for human detection is susceptible to errors due to both malicious perturbations and naturally occurring fog phenomena. To the best of our knowledge, we are the first to explicitly employ a natural perturbation (like fog) as an adversarial attack using methods from computer graphics. Our experimental results show that computer vision algorithms are susceptible to errors under a small set of naturally occurring perturbations even if they are robust to a majority of such perturbations. Our methods and results may be of interest to the designers, developers and validation teams of intelligent cyber-physical systems such as autonomous cars. \u00c2\u00a9 2017 IEEE.",

This paper adopts modeling and simulation methods to investigate the take-off process of a cormorant from water surface, and to explore how the wings and feet function to improve the takeoff performance on water. Quasi-steady blade element method and hydrodynamic equation were used to analyze the forces produced by flapping wings and slapping feet respectively. The dynamic model of the cormorant's take-off from water was established. Then video-based kinematic data were obtained to verify the accuracy of this model. Further, The effects of the flapping frequency, body angle attack and webbed feet area on takeoff distance were investigated and discussed based on simulation results. The results demonstrate that the flapping frequency and webbed feet area contributes substantially to reducing take-off distance. \u00c2\u00a9 2017 IEEE.",

It is assumed that Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) cooperatively explore a static spatial field that can be represented with a few non-zero coefficients, i.e., the model of a process is sparse. The recovery of the sparse model in a distributed setting is solved with a Distributed LASSO (DLASSO) algorithm that implements an Alternating Direction Method of Multipliers (ADMM). Based on the cooperatively estimated model, a swarm of UAVs decides on its next movements using optimal experiment design strategies. To this end, second order information of the optimization problem is approximated using a theory of slantly differentiable functions. Also, an additional adaptive trade-off parameter between exploration of new areas and exploitation of the already obtained information is proposed and tested. The experiments are performed in a laboratory environment with two UAVs measuring a height profile with an ultrasonic sensor. The experiments show that the proposed method is very useful for time consuming measurements, if the observed process can be assumed to be sparse. Also, the adaptive method increases the overall system performance with respect to the number of measurements. \u00c2\u00a9 2017 IEEE.",

      "abstract": "Security of (semi)-autonomous vehicles is a growing concern due to, first, the growing reliance of car functionalities on diverse (semi)-autonomous systems; second, the increased exposure of the such functionalities to potential attackers; third, the interaction of a single vehicle with myriads of other smart systems in an modern urban traffic infrastructure. In this paper, we review the security objectives of Autonomous Vehicle (AV) and argue that AV is a kind of Cyber-Physical System (CPS) for control and operations of the vehicle. We attempt to identify the core issues of securing an AV by modeling an AV as a special kind of CPS, which tend to be implemented by a complex interconnected embedded system hardware. Subsequently, the technical challenges of AV security are identified. \u00c2\u00a9 2017 IEEE.",

      "abstract": "We are seeing rapid development of in-vehicle, vehicleto- vehicle, intelligent roadway, infrastructure and ride-hailing systems. However, progress in some areas is much faster than in others. For example, in-vehicle self-driving systems are evolving rapidly, but development of intelligent road systems is relatively sluggish. These systems are beginning to interconnect and interoperate to become complex systems-of-systems for which attack surfaces and vulnerabilities are expanding exponentially. Many of these systems are standalone and proprietary and do not interoperate. However, systems must be seamlessly integrated if we are to arrive at safe and secure fully-autonomous road vehicles. If we do not create broad standards early on, we can expect vulnerabilities to grow so much that they could overwhelm potential benefits from improved safety and fuel economies. Warnings about cybersecurity consequences of such complexities appear from time to time in academic publications and the popular press, but few companies and government agencies do not seem to heed these admonitions and suggestions. Meanwhile, the self-driving juggernaut ploughs ahead. Here, we identify likely cybersecurity consequences that will arise because current efforts reflect uncoordinated design and development, particularly of supporting infrastructure systems. We describe how such risks might be mitigated proactively by introducing cybersecurity requirements early in the design, development and deployment processes. We also discuss how we might establish universal automotive and transportation security and safety standards that are enforceable and can be enforced globally across in-vehicle and ex-vehicle systems. While we see impressive near-term advances, particularly with in-vehicle systems and vehicle-to-vehicle systems, such innovations will eventually hit a roadblock if infrastructure systems, both physical and cyber, do not receive the attention required to achieve acceptable levels of cybersecurity and safety. \u00c2\u00a9 2017 IEEE.",

In particular, we consider a basic two-user scenario, and investigate how the UAV can optimally exploit its mobility via trajectory design to maximize the amount of energy transferred to the two ERs during a finite charging period. We characterize the achievable energy region of the two ERs, by optimizing the UAV's trajectory subject to a maximum speed constraint. We show that when the distance between the two ERs is smaller than a certain threshold, the Pareto boundary of the energy region is achieved when the UAV hovers above a fixed location between them during the whole charging period; while when their distance is larger than the threshold, to achieve the boundary of the energy region, the UAV in general needs to hover and fly between two different locations above the line connecting them. Numerical results show that the optimized UAV trajectory can significantly improve the WPT efficiency and fairness of the two ERs, especially when the UAV's maximum speed is large and/or the charging duration is long. \u00c2\u00a9 2017 IEEE.",

This paper presents an emergency rear-end collision avoidance control strategy using hierarchical control framework which consists of threat assessment layer, tire slip ratio control layer. The threat assessment layer continuously calculates threat metrics associated with collision avoidance by braking control. As for the tire slip ratio control layer, a radial basis function neural network (RBFNN) variable structure control (VSC) algorithm is designed to track optimal slip ratio, which enabled the controlled vehicle to generate the highest possible deceleration. Finally, simulation test is conducted via MATLAB/Simulink platform on dry and wet asphalt pavement at high speed. The results show that the proposed AEB control scheme effectively performs collision avoidance maneuvers. \u00c2\u00a9 2017 IEEE.",

      "abstract": "Destination IP prefix-based routing protocols are core to Internet routing today. Internet autonomous systems (AS) possess fixed IP prefixes, while packets carry the intended destination AS's prefix in their headers, in clear text. As a result, network communications can be easily identified using IP addresses and become targets of a wide variety of attacks, such as DNS/IP filtering, distributed Denial-of-Service (DDoS) attacks, man-in-the-middle (MITM) attacks, etc. In this work, we explore an alternative network architecture that fundamentally removes such vulnerabilities by disassociating the relationship between IP prefixes and destination networks, and by allowing any end-to-end communication session to have dynamic, short-lived, and pseudo-random IP addresses drawn from a range of IP prefixes rather than one. The concept is seemingly impossible to realize in todays Internet. We demonstrate how this is doable today with three different strategies using software defined networking (SDN), and how this can be done at scale to transform the Internet addressing and routing paradigms with the novel concept of a distributed software defined Internet exchange (SDX). The solution works with both IPv4 and IPv6, whereas the latter provides higher degrees of IP addressing freedom. Prototypes based on Open vSwitches (OVS) have been implemented for experimentation across the PEERING BGP testbed. The SDX solution not only provides a technically sustainable pathway towards large-scale traffic analysis resistant network (TARN) support, it also unveils a new business model for customer-driven, customizable and trustable end-to-end network services. \u00c2\u00a9 2017 IEEE.",

Visual homing is an AI local navigation technique used to direct a robot to a previously seen location, and is inspired by biological models. Most visual homing uses a panoramic camera. Prior work has shown that exploiting depth cues in homing from, e.g., a stereo-camera, leads to improved performance. However, many stereo-cameras have a limited field of view (FOV). We present a stereovision database methodology for visual homing. We use two databases we have collected, one indoor and one outdoor, to evaluate the effect of FOV on the performance of our homing with stereovision algorithm. Based on over 120,000 homing trials, we show that contrary to intuition, a panoramic field of view does not necessarily lead to the best performance, and we discuss the implications of this. \u00c2\u00a9 2017 IEEE.",

      "abstract": "Smart Cities is a world-wide initiative leading to better exploit the resources in a city in order to offer higher level services to people. In this context, urban computing is a process of acquisition, integration, and analysis of big and heterogeneous data generated by a diversity of sources in urban spaces, such as sensors, traffic devices, vehicles, buildings, and humans, to tackle the major issues that cities face, e.g. air pollution, increased energy consumption and traffic congestion. The majority of these information can be represented as graphs, such as the transportation network, in which places (nodes) are connected by some form of public transportation (edges). A vision of the 'city of the future', or even the city of the present, rests on the integration of science and technology through information systems. This vision requires a re-thinking of the relationships between technology, government, city managers, business, academia and the research community. This position paper presents our views towards developing techniques for querying and evolving graph-modeled datasets based on user-defined constraints. Our focus is to show how these techniques can be applied to effectively retrieve urban data and have automated mechanisms that guarantee data consistency. \u00c2\u00a9 2017 IEEE.",

The existing surveillance systems are sufficient to monitor crowded areas but are not suitable for monitoring secluded places. The crimes are likely to occur in places with less crowd and make surveillance challenging, which eventually leads to an increase in crime rate. This paper discusses the development of an UAV based security system that responds to a request from a wearable gadget by a user probably a woman who faces a possible threat. The proposed approach focuses on the night time operation the period in which most of the physical attacks would occur. The person, who is facing a possible threat can request for assistance using a primary wearable gadget, which will send the GPS location to the control station. Then a UAV will be deployed to the target location which identifies and tracks the motion of the person using a secondary wearable gadget. This paper also proposes a low cost and lesser computational intensive solution for motion tracking. \u00c2\u00a9 2017 IEEE.",

First of all, it is necessary to better understanding the evolution of UAV commercial applications in order to understand which opportunities can be grasped. In parallel it is also fundamental identifying which critical success factors are required, both at the technological and organizational level, to effectively compete in this complex and growing market. A literature review allowed to identify the main aspects to be investigated, then a survey has been conducted involving companies already operating in the UAV sector in order to elicit the market opportunities, in terms of type of missions, as well as the key elements of the product and service offer. The competences required for offering innovative solutions in the UAV market have also been mapped. Moreover, the level of collaboration among the various players involved in the UAV markets has been explored. This survey provides seed information for the development of the whole methodology and its implementation for specific types of UAV missions, in particular in this work will be explored its role in the definition of a QFD analysis linking customer generic requirements with technical features of UAV products and services required for satisfying them. \u00c2\u00a9 2017 IEEE.",

In this paper, we propose a novel layered architecture where NFPs, of various types and flying at low/medium/high layers in a swarm of flying platforms, are considered as an integrated part of the future cellular networks to inject additional capacity and expand the coverage for exceptional scenarios (sports events, concerts, etc.) and hard-to-reach areas (rural or sparsely populated areas). Successful roll-out of the proposed architecture depends on several factors including, but are not limited to: network optimisation for NFP placement and association, safety operations of NFP for network/equipment security, and reliability for NFP transport and control/signaling mechanisms. In this work, we formulate the optimum placement of NFP at a Lower Layer (LL) by exploiting the airborne Self-organising Network (SON) features. Our initial simulations show the NFP-LL can serve more User Equipment (UE)s using this placement technique. \u00c2\u00a9 2017 IEEE.",

The key points of this paper are: I) for EC, to efficiently exploit the inherent correlation relationship between the lost region and its known adjacent region, this paper introduces a special CCM in order that their convolution model results via different convolution filters are close to the counterpart on the convolution space; ii) for ISR, we develop CCM to train two convolution filters and map the original low-resolution(LR) and high-resolution(HR) image patches onto a unified convolution subspace. iii) as for MIF, since image fusion depends on the local information of source images resulting from the same scene, this paper constructs a special Coupled Two-Dimensional Convolution Model (2D-CCM) for the image patches from different source images. Experimental results show that the proposed CCM is very effective for EC, ISR and MIF. \u00c2\u00a9 2017 IEEE.",

In this study1, a data-driven approach was used to extract probabilistic models of the behaviours of other cars and exploit them to support a driving system based on Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS). The model selection component of the architecture infers which models better explain the current behaviours of the other vehicles using maximum likelihood estimation for Bayesian model comparison. The inferred behaviours are then used for MCTS-based control to prevent rollouts on models that are not relevant in the current context. While the use of multiple models allows improved efficiency and higher flexibility, it also introduces identification-related issues, which were solved here using Bayesian machine learning. The results obtained from the performed simulations are presented comparing the proposed MCTS architecture when employing multiple models with a naive model of the other vehicles. \u00c2\u00a9 2017 IEEE.",

By exploiting the wide-angle camera mounted on the UAV, the system can collect detailed ground information including UGV and destination positions before the UAV sends steering and speed update instructions to the UGV via wireless communications. To optimize the route design from UGV to its destination, we develop various route optimization algorithms by taking into account the position of the anticipated next destination using a probabilistic model.

      "abstract": "The perception of traffic related objects in the vehicles environment is an essential prerequisite for future autonomous driving. Cameras are particularly suited for this task, as the traffic relevant information of a scene is inferable from its visual appearance. In traffic scene understanding, semantic segmentation denotes the task of generating and labeling regions in the image that correspond to specific object categories, such as cars or road area. In contrast, the task of scene recognition assigns a global label to an image, that reflects the overall category of the scene. This paper presents a deep neural network (DNN) capable of solving both problems in a computationally efficient manner. The architecture is designed to avoid redundant computations, as the task specific decoders share a common feature encoder stage. A novel Hadamard layer with element-wise weights efficiently exploits spatial priors for the segmentation task. Traffic scene segmentation is investigated in conjunction with road topology recognition based on the cityscapes dataset [1] augmented with manually labeled road topology ground truth data. \u00c2\u00a9 2017 IEEE.",

      "abstract": "The use of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) as aerial base stations (BSS) is of great practical significance in future wireless networks, especially for on-demand deployment during a temporary event and emergency situation. Although prior works have demonstrated the performance improvement brought by the UAV mobility, they mainly focus on the delay-tolerant applications such as file transfer and data collection. As such, it is unknown if the UAV mobility is able to provide performance gain for delay-constrained applications, such as video conferencing and online gaming. Motivated by this, we study in this paper a UAV-enabled downlink orthogonal division multiple access (OFDMA) network where a UAV is dispatched to serve two ground users within a given flight period. By taking into account the delay-specified minimum-rate-ratio constraints of the users, our goal is to maximize the minimum user throughput by jointly optimizing the UAV trajectory and communication resource allocation. We show that the max-min user throughput in general decreases as the minimum-rate-ratio constraints become more stringent, which reveals a fundamental tradeoff between the throughput gain by exploiting the UAV mobility and the user delay requirement. Simulation results verify our theoretical findings and also demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed design. \u00c2\u00a9 2017 University of Western Australia.",

      "abstract": "The successful deployment of safe and trustworthy Connected and Autonomous Vehicles (CAVs) will highly depend on the ability to devise robust and effective security solutions to resist sophisticated cyber attacks and patch up critical vulnerabilities. Pseudonym Public Key Infrastructure (PPKI) is a promising approach to secure vehicular networks as well as ensure data and location privacy, concealing the vehicles' real identities. Nevertheless, pseudonym distribution and management affect PPKI scalability due to the significant number of digital certificates required by a single vehicle. In this paper, we focus on the certificate revocation process and propose a versatile and low-complexity framework to facilitate the distribution of the Certificate Revocation Lists (CRL) issued by the Certification Authority (CA). CRL compression is achieved through optimized Bloom filters, which guarantee a considerable overhead reduction with a configurable rate of false positives. Our results show that the distribution of compressed CRLs can significantly enhance the system scalability without increasing the complexity of the revocation process. \u00c2\u00a9 2017 IEEE.",

      "abstract": "Detection of lane change maneuvers of other traffic participants is one key element looking at highly automated driving and future driver assistance systems. A wide number of publications have shown approaches exploiting solely high level features from processed sensor data. Looking at low level features, vision based systems offer high potential for the tasks of lane change detection in the image domain, like the positioning of objects relative to the lane markings or the evaluation of their movement towards adjacent lanes. Among conventional image processing algorithms deployed, optical flow is an appropriate approach towards the latter task, that is affected by translation and rotation of the ego vehicle. In this paper we introduce true flow as an addition to conventional optical flow. Translational and rotational influence of ego motion is eliminated, allowing to estimate solely the observed object behavior. Features for lane change detection are presented and their invariance is shown under variable conditions, using simulation data. Experimental evaluation shows feature performance and predictability based on a real world data test set. \u00c2\u00a9 2017 IEEE.",

Detection of such threats is typically limited to knowledge-based and vehicle-specific methods, which are applicable to only specific known attacks, or methods that require computation power that is prohibitive for resource-constrained vehicles. Here, we present a method based on Bayesian Networks that can not only tell whether an autonomous vehicle is under attack, but also whether the attack has originated from the cyber or the physical domain. We demonstrate the feasibility of the approach on an autonomous robotic vehicle built in accordance with the Generic Vehicle Architecture specification and equipped with a variety of popular communication and sensing technologies. The results of experiments involving command injection, rogue node and magnetic interference attacks show that the approach is promising. \u00c2\u00a9 2017 IEEE.",

In the case of an accident involving multiple stakeholders with various (dis)incentives to honestly report, the question arises how to reconstruct the accident scene with validated and authenticated data without relying on a centralized authority. In this paper, we introduce Proof of Physics (PoP), a consensus mechanism whereby environmental (sensor) data is persisted only after audit and computational agreement that the recorded event occurred. Vehicles perform permissionless (e.g., requiring no centralized authority) writes of the signatures of their recorded events and associated content. The blocktree aggregates the verified data enabling querying over validated historic events. We evaluate the blocktree security by analyzing the ability of a malicious attacker to successfully fork the vehicle blocktree. We show that the attacker's success probability approaches negligible as the number of vehicle witnesses and confirmations increases. \u00c2\u00a9 2017 IEEE.",

V2X is known as a critical component for the vision of connected and autonomous vehicles in the future, with the goal of improving safety, saving energy, optimizing the traffic, etc. Many stake holders (e.g., 3GPP, IEEE) have announced the draft standards or technical reports that detail new opportunities of V2X-enabled vehicles for the cellular and automotive industries. However, the security issues in V2X communications receive little attention from industry and academia communities. In this paper, we describe how adversaries can exploit the security vulnerabilities to degrade the performance of V2X communications and evaluate the likelihood of V2X-specific attacks in undermining the road safety. Our investigation reveals that the existing security mechanisms fall short of addressing the key security threats, and we also discuss countermeasures by adding a security sub-layer for V2X communication protocols to provide V2X users with privacy, authentication, and confidentiality. \u00c2\u00a9 2017 IEEE.",

Given the limited amount of LiDAR data for cyclists for the task of cyclist detection, a realistic synthetic data generation pipeline has been adopted in this work to overcome this problem by generate virtually unlimited number of synthetic training, testing and validation depth image datasets of cyclists. Then, using a holistic detection technique, any instances of cyclists can be localised in the generated synthetic depth images which can be shown as a down-sampled instances of 3D LiDAR data. The proposed technique in this paper, exploits the Faster Region-based Convolutional Network (Faster R-CNN) architecture for simultaneously detecting and localising any instances of cyclists in depth images. The trained Faster R-CNN models have been tested on the widely popular KITTI urban dataset and the results show that the proposed framework outperforms the classical HOG+SVM object localisation method with increased 21% in average precision. This shows the ability of the trained models using the proposed framework to generalise from synthetic training dataset to operate on live dataset. \u00c2\u00a9 2017 IEEE.",

The Environment Condition Assessment, which is another important novelty of the architecture, informs augmented sensors on current sensing conditions. Utilizing environment conditions and performance values for subsequent centralized integrity checks allow algorithms to adapt to current driving conditions and thereby to increase their robustness. We demonstrate the benefit of the approach with the example of false positive object detection and tracking, where the detection of a ghost object is resolved in centralized performance assessment using a Bayesian network. \u00c2\u00a9 2017 IEEE.",

      "abstract": "Since unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) can be flexibly deployed in the scenarios of environmental monitoring, remote sensing, search-and-rescue, etc., the network protocols of UAV networks supporting high data rate transmission have attracted considerable attentions. In this paper, the three-dimensional aerial sensor network is studied, where UAVs act as aerial sensors. The delay tolerant multiple access control protocol which is called UD-MAC1, is designed for UAV networks. The UD-MAC exploits the returning UAVs to store and carry the data of the UAVs along the returning paths to the destination. The returning UAVs are discovered by ground via the Control and Non-Payload Communication (CNPC) links, which contain the sense and avoid information among UAVs. And they are confirmed by the other UAVs via data links. Simulation results show that UD-MAC protocol increases the enhances of accessing channel by 31.8% compared with VeMAC protocol. \u00c2\u00a9 2017 IEEE.",

      "abstract": "Safety requirements have been critical to the automotive software systems, and various advanced driving assistance systems and automated emergency braking systems have been developed with complex software systems. In this article, we propose a modeling and quantitative analysis method of safety requirements which integrates the safety patterns, extended misuse case analysis and evaluation method based on the Bayesian networks. In automotive software systems, the threats to the safety include not only external factors from outside the automobile, but also internal factors such as a driver's erroneous operation. The proposed method enables to analyze both internal and external factors of the system as the hazards to the safety of the systems. First, we define safety a set of patterns as a pair of a cause and the mitigation use cases in order to prevent hazards. With the safety patterns, we can identify a set of mitigation points. Then, we analyze extended misuse cases, which enables to identify hazards to the system failures, and mitigation use cases from the misuse case scenarios. Finally, with the Bayesian networks, we quantitatively evaluate the effect of safety requirements by comparing the accident probability of before and after the application of mitigation use cases. We applied the propose method to the actual autonomous emergency braking systems of passenger vehicles of different model years, and demonstrated the validity and effectiveness of the method. \u00c2\u00a9 2017 IEEE.",

      "abstract": "Strategic decision making plays an important role in disaster management. In view of an imminent or already occurring event, e.g. flood, that has the potential to stress and threaten populated regions, humanitarian supply chain management is a place where strategic decision making plays a major role. Sensible or strategic measures have to be developed in order to mitigate damages. Strategic measures should take into account available and possibly distributed resources, e.g. vehicles, storages and street networks, and of course the type of measure against the background of protection goals. Finding good or sensible measures becomes a hard task if the menaced region refers to a densely populated area, where the functionality of street network has a dynamic feature in terms of the emergence of blocked segments. This task gets even harder if the protection of certain critical infrastructures also has to be considered. Our work proposes a framework of a decision support system that is based on the synergetic coupling of a critical infrastructure and a traffic simulation module. By defining different event scenarios, different simulation runs can be triggered beforehand and according to the decision maker's preferences, sensible measures in terms of type of resources and routes are stored and displayed to the decision maker. Especially simultaneously occurring issues of different problem categories requiring decisions by various decision makers are addressed. \u00c2\u00a9 2017 IEEE.",

The property casualty insurance industry is not an exception. The inspection of a roof's condition is a preliminary stage of the damage claim processing performed by insurance adjusters. When insurance adjusters inspect a roof, it is a time consuming and potentially dangerous endeavor. In this paper, we propose to automate this assessment using RGB imagery of rooftops that have been inflicted with damage from hail impact collected using small unmanned aircraft systems (sUAS) along with deep learning to infer the extent of roof damage (see Fig. I). We assess multiple convolutional neural networks on our unique rooftop damage dataset that was gathered using a sUAS. Our experiments show that we can accurately identify hail damage automatically using our techniques. \u00c2\u00a9 2017 IEEE.",

Environments such as underground tunnels are one of many harsh areas that still need exploration and exploitation by autonomous systems in the field robotics. In this paper, a robust cooperative framework is presented for pre emergency and disaster management, in other words, safety prevention measures in the underground terrain. The system is designed for n-robots to understand the emergency and disaster behaviours of one another and cooperate while avoiding collision. The framework logically establishes a QLACS model based on Ant Colony System (ACS) and QLearning (QL) techniques. To provide a robust way of achieving pre-emergency and disaster management in the mine, the scalable QLACS was tested with 2-robots, 3-robots and 4-robots. The performance evaluation result shows that the QLACS is reliably robust in communication and search costs, and also scalable to n-based MRS. \u00c2\u00a9 2017 IEEE.",

Unfortunately, because of the increased vehicular mobility, they require frequent antenna beam realignments-thus significantly increasing the in-band Beamforming (BF) overhead. In this paper, we propose Smart Motion-prediction Beam Alignment (SAMBA), a MAC-layer algorithm that exploits the information broadcast via DSRC beacons by all vehicles. Based on these information, overhead-free BF is achieved by estimating the position of the vehicle and predicting its motion. Moreover, adapting the beamwidth with respect to the estimated position can further enhance the performance. Our investigation shows that SAMBA outperforms the IEEE 802.11ad BF strategy, increasing the data rate by more than twice for sparse vehicle density while enhancing the network throughput proportionally to the number of vehicles. Furthermore, SAMBA was proven to be more efficient compared to legacy BF algorithm under highly dynamic vehicular environments and hence, a viable solution for future ITS services. \u00c2\u00a9 2017 IEEE.",

There are lot of issues in pertaining to this methodology like wrong reading, Door locked, person not visiting the house and so. Now towards this, quite amount of research carried out towards employing technologies like Power line communication, Zigbee wireless communication and even GPRS mobile communication in retrieving the utility bill from the consumer's house leading to what is called Automated Metering Infrastructure i.e AMI. Though AMI seems very convenient towards accessing the energy meter value for calculating the bill amount remotely without person visiting the house, there are lot of security challenges pertaining to meter reading being modified, attacking meter software and so. Zigbee networks come with AES 128 bit security technology which is the most popular one. In addition to AES, there also exists other most powerful security technology called 'Elliptical Curve Cryptography (ECC)' which is proved to be most powerful and secure due to its elliptical curve nature and not relying only on key length. So towards developing a powerful security protocol in AMI, we in this research propose to compare the two security protocols-AES and ECC in AMI towards key generation time, Encryption and Decryption. This has been analyzed for varying energy unit bit values using Python. \u00c2\u00a9 2017 IEEE.",

Ant Colony Algorithm has been exploited to derive the optimal solution. The proposed model is solved in Simulink simulation environment. The results show this method can effectively solve the complex decision problem of selecting the best vehicle from a number of feasible pickup vehicles. According to the dynamic situation, the vehicle routing path can be update and optimize in time. This method can significantly shorten the delivery and pick-up time, greatly improve the customer's dynamic order response speed, improve customer satisfaction, and reduce logistics costs. \u00c2\u00a9 2017 IEEE.",

The major contribution of this work was to show that active walking with autonomous gait adjustment is possible without any explicit controller. Our testbed is capable of generating typical quadruped gaits and selects one of them automatically despite being composed of only a purely physical mechanism with no sensor, brain, or controller. The key idea of this approach is to exploit the weakness of a low-Torque DC motor. This passivity takes the function of an oscillator model and delays its own phase. Some fundamental properties of the robot and its gaits with different input voltage were demonstrated in the experiments. \u00c2\u00a9 2017 IEEE.",

MmWave needs array gain for the best performance, but this requires correctly pointing the beam, known as beam alignment. Dynamic blockages make beam alignment challenging in the vehicular setting. This paper proposes to leverage a vehicle's position along with past beam measurements to rank desirable pointing directions that can reduce the required beam training to a small set of pointing directions. The ranking is conducted using a learning-to-rank approach, which is a popular machine learning method used in recommender systems. The learning uses a kernel based model, and a new metric for evaluating ranked lists of pointing directions tailored to beam alignment is proposed. The proposed method provides a scalable framework for exploiting context information. \u00c2\u00a9 2017 IEEE.",

      "abstract": "The use of biologically realistic (brain-like) control systems in autonomous robots offers two potential benefits. For neuroscience, it may provide important insights into normal and abnormal control and decision-making in the brain, by testing whether the computational learning and decision rules proposed on the basis of simple laboratory experiments lead to effective and coherent behaviour in complex environments. For robotics, it may offer new insights into control system designs, for example in the context of threat avoidance and self-preservation. In the brain, learning and decision-making for rewards and punishments (such as pain) are thought to involve integrated systems for innate (Pavlovian) responding, habit-based learning, and goal-directed learning, and these systems have been shown to be well-described by RL models. Here, we simulated this 3-system control hierarchy (in which the innate system is derived from an evolutionary learning model), and show that it reliably achieves successful performance in a dynamic predator-avoidance task. Furthermore, we show situations in which a 3-system architecture provides clear advantages over single or dual system architectures. Finally, we show that simulating a computational model of obsessive compulsive disorder, an example of a disease thought to involve a specific deficit in the integration of habit-based and goal-directed systems, can reproduce the results of human clinical experiments. The results illustrate how robotics can provide a valuable platform to test the validity and utility of computational models of human behaviour, in both health and disease. They also illustrate how bio-inspired control systems might usefully inform self-preservative behaviour in autonomous robots, both in normal and malfunctioning situations. \u00c2\u00a9 2017 IEEE.",

      "abstract": "Video games have increasingly demonstrated a great deal of audiovisual realism, in par with the massive performance improvement of computer systems. At the same time, their Artificial Intelligence (AI) component falls short in terms of realism because it is usually based on non-adaptive methods. Adaptive AI mechanisms can help increase video game realism allowing the game to adapt in real-time to the game progress and the user behavior. Following a short overview of the progress of AI in video games in the past years, this paper highlights the creation of modern video games with basic and elementary adaptive game AI using the Unity game development framework. Particular emphasis is on the details of the AI component. First, a shooter game with basic AI is created. Finally, an action-adventure video game is created featuring elementary case-based adaptive AI. The objective in this game is to create enemies which are able to perceive changes in the environment and adapt their strategies accordingly. Proposed AI practices can migrate into relevant real world applications, such as video surveillance and intrusion detection systems, mission critical autonomous networked patrolling and/or save and rescue robots, vision and hearing assistive applications, intelligent video and behavioral analytics to detect and predict threats etc. \u00c2\u00a9 2017 IEEE.",

      "abstract": "Driver behavioral analysis can be described as the process of analyzing sensor data collected from a vehicle to identify unique facets of the manner the vehicle handles while under the control of a driver. This analysis can be used to either uniquely identify a driver or differentiate him/her from other drivers. Driver behavioral analysis has practical applications in insurance, safety and security. Autonomous vehicle controllers are software systems that are static by nature. This implies that while driver behavior analysis can be carried out on autonomous vehicles, the unique driving patterns that can be used to differentiate human drivers will not be possible with autonomous vehicles controlled by the same agent. This scenario is undesirable from a security viewpoint. It is widely accepted that the predictability of software systems makes them vulnerable, this is more so if a large of number of users utilize the software system. Based on the above, in this paper, we argue for the necessity of creating diversity in the driving behavior of autonomous vehicles. We present a conceptual framework that lays out how this can be accomplished at low cost, with high flexibility and without compromising one of the major advantages of autonomous vehicles - safety. Using the example of a remote vehicle hijack, an attack scenario that has shown to be practical in recent times, we highlight an application of our proposed model. We show how having diverse behavior is advantageous in creating a fail-safe remote vehicle hijack detection system. \u00c2\u00a9 2017 IEEE.",

      "abstract": "This paper investigates the problem of data routing in flying ad hoc networks (FANETs) composed of multiple flying nodes, i.e., unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), supported by communication platforms. The objective is to exploit the mobility of UAVs in order to establish routing paths and transfer a message between two ground nodes at minimum transmission time. Assuming that the UAVs are already deployed to execute a given primary task, the cooperation of the UAVs in the data transfer process, considered as a secondary task, becomes subject to three conditions. First, the energy consumed by each UAV has to respect the allocated budget for the data routing process. Second, the UAVs cannot move out of the boundaries of a tolerated and well-defined region in order to maintain the operation of the primary task. Finally, the UAVs need to reduce their traveled distances in order to reduce the delay of the transfer. A mixed non-linear integer programming problem determining the routing path and the new locations of the UAVs participating in the data transfer process is formulated. Due to its non-convexity, we proceed with a deterministic exploratory strategy inspired from the Hooke-Jeeves algorithm to meet the problem goals. Selected numerical results investigate the performance of the proposed solution for different scenarios and compare some of them to those of a meta-heuristic approach based on swarm intelligence. \u00c2\u00a9 2017 IEEE.",

In the considered system, two UAVNs, a primary UAVN with licensed spectrum and a secondary UAVN without licensed spectrum, i.e., the overlaid UAVN, coexist in a three-dimensional (3D) Euclidean space. In order to evaluate the connectivity of the considered system more realistically, the trust model is established and the concept of trust connectivity is proposed to jointly take the physical link and trust link into account. Moreover, the analytical expressions of the trust transmission probability and the packet delivery success probability are derived for the overlaid UAVN.

      "abstract": "Free space detection is crucial to autonomous vehicles while existing works are not entirely satisfactory. As cameras have many advantages on environment perception, a stereo vision-based robust free space detection method is proposed which mainly depends on geometry information and Gaussian process regression. In this work, in order to improve the performance by exploiting multiple source information, we apply Bayesian framework and conditional random field inference to fuse the multimodal information including 2-D image and 3-D point geometric information. Particularly, a Bayesian framework is used for multiple feature fusion to provide a normalized and flexible output. Gaussian process regression is used to automatically and incrementally regress the data, resulting enhanced performance. Finally, conditional random field with color and geometry constrains is applied to make the result more robust. In order to evaluate the proposed method, quantitative experiments on popular KITTI-road data set and qualitative experiments on our own campus data set are tested. The results show satisfactory and inspiring performance compared to the outstanding works and even are competitive to some relevant Lidar-based methods. \u00c2\u00a9 The Author(s) 2017.",

The new techniques embedded in the navigation particle filter include an adaptive-likelihood particle filter and a magnetic contour matching algorithm implemented in the Fourier domain to achieve superior computation speeds. The performance of the navigation methods proposed is assessed through a series of tests which exploit real data acquired in the water with a marine robotic vehicle.

To support decision making in IAPs monitoring, semi-automated image classifiers which are capable of extracting valuable information in remotely sensed data are vital. This study evaluated the mapping accuracies of supervised and unsupervised image classifiers for mapping Harrisia pomanensis (a cactus plant commonly known as the Midnight Lady) using two interlinked evaluation strategies i.e. point and area based accuracy assessment. Results of the point-based accuracy assessment show that with reference to 219 ground control points, the supervised image classifiers (i.e. Maxver and Bhattacharya) mapped H. pomanensis better than the unsupervised image classifiers (i.e. K-mediuns, Euclidian Length and Isoseg). In this regard, user and producer accuracies were 82.4% and 84% respectively for the Maxver classifier. The user and producer accuracies for the Bhattacharya classifier were 90% and 95.7%, respectively. Though the Maxver produced a higher overall accuracy and Kappa estimate than the Bhattacharya classifier, the Maxver Kappa estimate of 0.8305 is not significantly (statistically) greater than the Bhattacharya Kappa estimate of 0.8088 at a 95% confidence interval. The area based accuracy assessment results show that the Bhattacharya classifier estimated the spatial extent of H. pomanensis with an average mapping accuracy of 86.1% whereas the Maxver classifier only gave an average mapping accuracy of 65.2%. Based on these results, the Bhattacharya classifier is therefore recommended for mapping H. pomanensis. These findings will aid in the algorithm choice making for the development of a semi-automated image classification system for mapping IAPs. \u00c2\u00a9 2017",

      "abstract": "Unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) communications has drawn significant interest recently due to many advantages such as low cost, high mobility, and on-demand deployment. This paper addresses the issue of physical-layer security in a UAV communication system, where a UAV sends confidential information to a legitimate receiver in the presence of a potential eavesdropper which are both on the ground. We aim to maximize the secrecy rate of the system by jointly optimizing the UAV's trajectory and transmit power over a finite horizon. In contrast to the existing literature on wireless security with static nodes, we exploit the mobility of the UAV in this paper to enhance the secrecy rate via a new trajectory design. Although the formulated problem is non-convex and challenging to solve, we propose an iterative algorithm to solve the problem efficiently, based on the block coordinate descent and successive convex optimization methods. Specifically, the UAV's transmit power and trajectory are each optimized with the other fixed in an alternating manner until convergence. Numerical results show that the proposed algorithm significantly improves the secrecy rate of the UAV communication system, as compared to benchmark schemes without transmit power control or trajectory optimization. \u00c2\u00a9 2017 IEEE.",

      "abstract": "We present a framework for distributed, energy efficient, and real time implementable algorithms for path planning in multi-agent systems. The proposed framework is presented in the context of a motivating example of capture the flag which is an adversarial game played between two teams of autonomous agents called defenders and attackers. We start with the centralized formulation of the problem as a linear program because of its computational efficiency. Then we present an approximation framework in which each agent solves a local version of the centralized linear program by communicating with its neighbors only. The premise in this work is that for practical multi-agent systems, real time implementability of distributed algorithms is more crucial then global optimality. Thus, instead of verifying the proposed framework by performing offline simulations in MATLAB, we run extensive simulations in a robotic simulator V-REP, which includes a detailed dynamic model of quadrotors. Moreover, to create a realistic scenario, we allow a human operator to control the attacker quadrotor through a joystick in a single attacker setup. These simulations authenticate that the proposed framework is real time implementable and results in a performance that is comparable with the global optimal solution under the considered scenarios. \u00c2\u00a9 2017",

      "abstract": "Trial and error is still the current approach for the design of many complex aerodynamic components, although extensive research is being carried out in automated optimisation methods. Thereafter these designs are computer simulated using Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD). Some optimisation tools are used, at most, for the final fine-tuning. This paper proposes the use of a robust, efficient and automated optimisation methodology throughout the whole design process. The use of these methodologies can yield improved yet not conventional designs, while reducing the design cycle time. This paper presents the development of an original, general methodology based on a multi-attribute, structured optimisation, following a so-called Hybrid Direct Search (HDS), which combines genetic, gradient and swarm search intelligence. An example case study of a wind tunnel shape optimisation is presented. The main contributions of this paper are the exploitation of the concepts of variable hierarchy and variable value change (i.e. optimisation phases) and the HDS optimisation method, which allows for an intelligent and efficient direct search in complex aerodynamic problems in which the use of surrogate based optimisation is not accurate enough. This optimisation methodology is applicable to advanced aerodynamic design in cars, aircraft, high-speed trains, etc.",

Detection of CAD in the early stages and treatment for the same will help in preventing from continuing further. However earlier and precise recognition of CAD from Electrocardiogram (ECG) signals using manual recognition is not an easy job to perform. Thus computer aided techniques are essential for the automatic classification of CAD condition. This work proposes an automated classification of normal and CAD conditions of ECG using linear techniques. In this method normal and CAD ECG beats are de-noised using Discrete Wavelet Transform (DWT) technique. Feature extraction of ECG signals is achieved by Discrete Cosine Transform (DCT). Dimensionality reduction of data set is done by Principle Component Analysis (PCA). The resulting PCA features are partitioned using Cross Validation Partition for the classification purpose. Normal and CAD ECG signals are classified by k-Nearest Neighbor (k-NN) classifier and obtained results are compared with Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifier. \u00c2\u00a9 2017 IEEE.",

      "abstract": "The multihole probe (MHP) is an effective instrument for relative wind measurements from small unmanned aircraft systems (sUAS). Two common drawbacks for the integration of commercial MHP systems into low-cost sUAS are that 1) the MHP airdata system cost can be several times that of the sUAS airframe; and 2) when extended from the airframe, the pressure-measuring probe is often exposed to damage during normal operations. A flush airdata system (FADS) with static pressure sensing ports mounted flush with the airframe skin provides an alternative to the MHP system. This project implements a FADS with multiple static pressure sensors located at selected locations on the airframe. Computational fluid dynamics simulations are used to determine the airframe locations with the highest pressure change sensitivity to changes in the airframe angle of attack and sideslip angle. Wind tunnel test results are reported with nonlinear least squares and neural networks regression methods applied to the pressure measurements to estimate the instantaneous angle of attack and sideslip. Both methods achieved mean errors of less than 18. A direct comparison of the regression methods show that the neural network method provides a more accurate relative wind angle estimate than the nonlinear least squares method. \u00c2\u00a9 2017 American Meteorological Society.",

      "abstract": "This paper presents a new planner based on Ant Colony Optimization for Real-coded domains (ACOr) for optimizing the trajectories of multiple Unmanned Aircraft Vehicles (UAVs) in Minimum Time Search (MTS) missions, where the UAVs have to shorten the detection time of a given target while avoiding collisions and Non-Flying Zones (NFZ). Therefore, the planner has to identify the UAV trajectories that minimize the Expected Time of Target Detection (ETTD) and nullify the total of NFZ overflights and of UAV collisions. To achieve it, the planner is backed by an ACOr that 1) ensures the feasibility of the trajectories by encoding them as a sequence of input UAV control commands and by decoding them through complex UAVs kinematic/dynamic models, 2) handles the uncertainty of the sensor and of the target location in the computation of the ETTD using Bayesian theory, and 3) improves the planning process with a heuristic that has been especially designed to exploit the probability and spatial properties of the problem. All these properties let our ACOr based planner handle successfully minimum time target detection missions in real world scenarios, as the results analyzed in this paper, obtained over different setups, show. \u00c2\u00a9 2017 ACM.",

The proposed algorithm is applicable to vehicles that can be modelled with differentially flat dynamics, like unicycle and bicycle kinematics. The main idea is to exploit the flatness property so as to finitely parametrize trajectories, and design a set of motion primitives that represent optimal constrained trajectories joining two configurations in a grid space. A procedure to determine constrained (though sub-optimal) trajectories joining arbitrary configurations based on the motion primitives is then proposed. This eases and accelerates the construction of the tree to the purpose of online trajectory (re)planning in an uncertain environment, where the obstacle map may be continuously updated as the vehicle moves around, or unexpected events may occur and alter the free configuration space. \u00c2\u00a9 2017",

Authentication of vehicular ad hoc networks is one method to help stop the potential hacking of autonomous vehicles. We propose a two-factor authentication for GPS signals by synchronizing with Stratum-1 clocks and digital signatures to prevent man-in-the-middle attacks. The experiment uses a computer to simulate a GPS signal that is sent to a Raspberry Pi 3 along with a timestamp and hashed key using RSA-1024. The Raspberry Pi 3 represents the vehicle. The method presented will prevent GPS spoofing attacks that are using modified or corrupted messages, an impersonation attack, or a roadside unit replication attack. \u00c2\u00a9 2017 IEEE.",

Usually users are taken as fully rational. However, behavioural economics contend that their decisions depend on a suite of individual non-economic factors, such as altruism. In this work we broaden the ways of engaging in ADR contracts users exhibiting different degrees of altruism and motivate them effectively to ultimately optimize the overall use of energy. We investigate the impact of altruism on the total incentives to be offered by the provider and the social welfare, and identify the optimal demand reduction and user targeting strategies for performing ADR in such populations. Based on experiments with real and synthetic data, we find that exploiting altruism can be beneficial for the social welfare of the system and the incentive costs of the provider. However, leveraging altruists should be performed carefully, since saddling them with high power reductions, although yielding lower total incentives, can prove inefficient for the social welfare of the system. \u00c2\u00a9 2017 IEEE.",

      "abstract": "The capability of autonomous formation flight has the potential to significantly enhance the utility and efficiency of small low-cost Unmanned Aerial Systems (UAS). Formations of small, inexpensive fixed-wing UAS allow for the sharing of remote sensing functionality, mission-level redundancy and range enhancements due to aerodynamic interactions widely exploited by migratory birds. This article presents a benchmark problem for scalable distributed flight control of formations of UAS with only local relative state information, one of the open problems in this field as of today. The benchmark is openly available and comprises a nonlinear six degrees of freedom dynamics model of an electric glider UAS. In this article we furthermore introduce a nominal guidance frame that does not require state information of other UAS and point out a fundamental issue related to wake vortex tracking during formation maneuvers. A set of LQ baseline controllers that are part of the benchmark is presented along with simulation results. \u00c2\u00a9 2017",

      "abstract": "Appliance-level power usage monitoring may help conserve electricity in homes. Several existing systems achieve this goal by exploiting appliances' power usage signatures identified in labor-intensive in situ training processes. Recent work shows that autonomous power usage monitoring can be achieved by supplementing a smart meter with distributed sensors that detect the working states of appliances. However, sensors must be carefully installed for each appliance, resulting in a high installation cost. This article presents Supero-the first ad hoc sensor system that can monitor appliance power usage without supervised training. By exploiting multisensor fusion and unsupervised machine learning algorithms, Supero can classify the appliance events of interest and autonomously associate measured power usage with the respective appliances. Our extensive evaluation in five real homes shows that Supero can estimate the energy consumption with errors less than 7.5%. Moreover, nonprofessional users can quickly deploy Supero with considerable flexibility. \u00c2\u00a9 2017 ACM.",

      "abstract": "The navigation system is a crucial element of the control chain of an Autonomous Underwater Vehicle (AUV) because of the unavailability of a reliable positioning system such as the Global Positioning System (GPS). High performance navigation capabilities are ensured by equipping vehicles with high grade INS (Inertial Navigation System) aided by a Doppler Velocity Log (DVL) among other sensors. For its nature, a DVL can work only within a limited range from the bottom precluding its use for deep water applications. This work analyses two different approaches to address the problem of deep water navigation. The first one is based on measurements of relative distance between different nodes (cooperating vehicles and a static gateway buoy) that constitute an acoustic underwater network. The second one is based on the data from a positioning system (the HiPAP system by Kongsberg) that is mounted on the support ship and that has a limited operational range. Results from the two approaches are evaluated based on the data collected during the COLLAB NGAS14 experimental campaign and processed off-line. The results have to be intended as a preliminary work towards the integration of several complementary methods within a unique navigation system capable of exploiting the different technologies towards robust and reliable deep water navigation capabilities. \u00c2\u00a9 2017",

      "abstract": "Enabling the Internet of things in remote areas without traditional communication infrastructure requires a multi-layer network architecture. The devices in the overlay network are required to provide coverage to the underlay devices as well as to remain connected to other overlay devices. The coordination, planning, and design of such two-layer heterogeneous networks is an important problem to address. Moreover, the mobility of the nodes and their vulnerability to adversaries pose new challenges to the connectivity. For instance, the connectivity of devices can be affected by changes in the network, e.g., the mobility of the underlay devices or the unavailability of overlay devices due to failure or adversarial attacks. To this end, this work proposes a feedback based adaptive, self-configurable, and resilient framework for the overlay network that cognitively adapts to the changes in the network to provide reliable connectivity between spatially dispersed smart devices. Our results show that if sufficient overlay devices are available, the framework leads to a connected configuration that ensures a high coverage of the mobile underlay network. Moreover, the framework can actively reconfigure itself in the event of varying levels of device failure. \u00c2\u00a9 2017 IEEE.",

      "abstract": "This paper studies the estimation of the synchromesh frictional torque and the output torque of the integrated system of an electric motor and a clutchless automated manual transmission (AMT) as part of a two-shaft parallel hybrid electric vehicle powertrain. The case study powertrain is discussed, and the dynamical model of the powertrain from the electric motor to the AMT output shaft, where it is linked to the torque coupler, is developed constituting the basis for the observer design. Given the fact that the aforementioned torques are unknown inputs to the system, they are modeled as state variables of a fictitious unforced linear time-invariant system in order to be aggregated into the systems dynamics. For the augmented system of the actual and fictitious states, a deterministic Luenberger observer and a stochastic Kalman-Bucy filter (KBF) are designed to estimate the synchromesh frictional torque and the output torque of the AMT. The estimation is based on measuring angular velocities of the electric motor and the AMT output shaft, together with the imparted electromagnetic torque of the traction motor on the system. A set of experiments with distinct scenarios is performed to compare the performance of the designed observers and to quantify by how much the KBF can improve the root-mean-square error (RMSE) of the estimation by mitigating the effect of the process and measurement noises. Ultimately, after validation of the designed observers, the estimated value of the synchromesh frictional torque is exploited in a closed-loop feedback configuration in order to track desired trajectories such as step, ramp, and sinusoidal torque commands. \u00c2\u00a9 1967-2012 IEEE.",

      "abstract": "Vehicular ad-hoc networks (VANETs) are vulnerable to jamming attacks, and frequency hopping-based anti- jamming techniques are not always applicable in VANETs due to the high mobility of the onboard units (OBUs) especially under a large scale network topology. In this paper, we use unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) to deal with VANET jamming, especially smart jamming that changes the jamming policy based on the ongoing communication status of the VANET. More specifically, the UAV relays the data of OBUs to another roadside unit (RSU) with a better transmission condition if the serving RSU is located in a heavily jammed area. The interactions between the UAV and the jammer are formulated as an anti-jamming UAV relay game, in which the UAV decides whether or not to relay the data of the OBU to another RSU that is far away from the jammer, and the latter chooses the jamming power. The Nash equilibria (NE) of the game are derived to reveal how the best UAV relay strategy depends on the transmission cost and the radio channel model. A hotbooting policy hill climbing (PHC)-based UAV relay strategy is proposed to address jamming in the dynamic UAV-aided VANET game without the knowledge of network model and jamming model. Simulation results show that the proposed relay strategy can efficiently reduce the bit error rate (BER) of OBU data and thus increase the utility of VANET in comparison with a Q-learning based scheme. \u00c2\u00a9 2017 IEEE.",

      "abstract": "The next-generation of partially and fully autonomous cars will be powered by embedded many-core platforms. Technologies for Advanced Driver Assistance Systems (ADAS) need to process an unprecedented amount of data within tight power budgets, making those platform the ideal candidate architecture. Integrating tens-to-hundreds of computing elements that run at lower frequencies allows obtaining impressive performance capabilities at a reduced power consumption, that meets the size, weight and power (SWaP) budget of automotive systems. Unfortunately, the inherent architectural complexity of many-core platforms makes it almost impossible to derive real-time guarantees using \u00e2\u0080\u009ctraditional\u00e2\u0080\u009d state-of-the-art techniques, ultimately preventing their adoption in real industrial settings. Having impressive average performances with no guaranteed bounds on the response times of the critical computing activities is of little if no use in safety-critical applications. Project Hercules will address this issue, and provide the required technological infrastructure to exploit the tremendous potential of embedded many-cores for the next generation of automotive systems. This work gives an overview of the integrated Hercules software framework, which allows achieving an order-of-magnitude of predictable performance on top of cutting-edge Commercial-Off-The-Shelf components (COTS). The proposed software stack will let both real-time and non real-time application coexist on next-generation, power-efficient embedded platforms, with preserved timing guarantees. \u00c2\u00a9 2017 Elsevier B.V.",

The motion trajectories are parameterized as polynomial splines and by exploiting the properties of B-spline basis functions, constraints on the trajectories are efficiently enforced. The approach is applied on two relevant cases. The first one elaborates a pick and place task for a Cartesian robot which is validated experimentally on an industrial plate transportation system. Depending on the task, the proposed method can reduce the motion time with 10 - 30% with respect to the currently applied trajectories. In a second case the approach is applied on the navigation of Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) flying in an uncertain dynamic environment. This problem is formulated in a receding-horizon fashion which can update trajectories with a rate of 2.5 Hz. A supporting software toolbox is provided that implements the proposed approach and facilitates its use. \u00c2\u00a9 2017",

      "abstract": "In this paper, we demonstrate that computer vision pipelines utilising deep neural architectures are well-suited to perform automated Holstein Friesian cattle detection as well as individual identification in agriculturally relevant setups. To the best of our knowledge, this work is the first to apply deep learning to the task of automated visual bovine identification. We show that off-the-shelf networks can perform end-to-end identification of individuals in top-down still imagery acquired from fixed cameras. We then introduce a video processing pipeline composed of standard components to efficiently process dynamic herd footage filmed by Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs). We report on these setups, as well as the context, training and evaluation of their components. We publish alongside new datasets: FriesianCattle2017 of in-barn top-down imagery, and AerialCattle2017 of outdoor cattle footage filmed by a DJI Inspire MkI UAV. We show that Friesian cattle detection and localisation can be performed robustly with an accuracy of 99.3% on this data. We evaluate individual identification exploiting coat uniqueness on 940 RGB stills taken after milking in-barn (89 individuals, accuracy = 86.1%). We also evaluate identification via a video processing pipeline on 46,430 frames originating from 34 clips (approx. 20 s length each) of UAV footage taken during grazing (23 individuals, accuracy = 98.1%). These tests suggest that, particularly when videoing small herds in uncluttered environments, an application of marker-less Friesian cattle identification is not only feasible using standard deep learning components - it appears robust enough to assist existing tagging methods. \u00c2\u00a9 2017 IEEE.",

      "abstract": "Recognizing roads and intersections in aerial images is a challenging problem in computer vision with many real world applications, such as localization and navigation for unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs). The problem is currently gaining momentum in computer vision and is still far from being solved. While recent approaches have greatly improved due to the advances in deep learning, they provide only pixel-level semantic segmentations. In this paper, we argue that roads and intersections should be recognized at the higher semantic level of road graphs - with roads being edges that connect nodes. Towards this goal we present a method consisting of two stages. During the first stage, we detect roads and intersections with a novel, dual-hop generative adversarial network (DH-GAN) that segments images at the level of pixels. At the second stage, given the pixelwise road segmentation, we find its best covering road graph by applying a smoothing-based graph optimization procedure. Our approach is able to outperform recent published methods and baselines on a large dataset with European roads. \u00c2\u00a9 2017 IEEE.",

      "abstract": "Formation flying of multiple Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) or satellites enables cooperation among agents, and thus constitutes a system of greater performance than the simple sum of its parts by taking advantage of that cooperation. As a prerequisite, how to reconfigure, energy-optimally or time-optimally, from the current formation to the desired one shall be planned beforehand. This paper addresses such a planning problem from the perspective of optimal control that exploits a direct sequential method. In our study, during the reconfiguration agents subject to nonlinear dynamics, and final formation constraints are imposed where there exist unknown parameters to be determined optimally. In the developed direct method the original problem is transcribed into a sequence of convex optimization problems via the control vector parameterization approach using piecewise-constant approximation. In the end, each instance in the sequence is essentially a programming problem (quadratic or linear) subject to linear constraints that can be solved very efficiently. In this paper, the proposed method has been applied to two scenarios: the energy-optimal reconfiguration of five UAVs and the time-optimal formation reconfiguration of four satellites. In our implementation the free open source solver CVX is used. By comparison with the global optimization technique provided in MATLAB, the solutions converge very fast to the global minimum. \u00c2\u00a9 2017",

      "abstract": "Background Despite recommendations that women give birth with a skilled birth attendant (SBA), 70% of births in Guatemala occur outside health facilities with informally trained traditional birth attendants (TBAs). To increase SBA in rural, indigenous communities, a professional midwifery school accredited by the government is scheduled to open in 2017. Drawing from Filby's model on barriers to the successful integration of professional midwifery into health systems, this paper aims to identify threats - and facilitators-toward professional midwifery's re-introduction in Guatemala. Methods To elucidate perceptions, attitudes and expectations towards professional midwifery, qualitative, in-depth interviews were conducted with 32 physicians, nurses, and TBAs in six health centers and with key decision makers and professional midwives (PMs) in Guatemala City. We conducted open and axial coding in Atlas.ti and performed normative comparisons of participants\u00e2\u0080\u0099 attitudes, perceptions, and expectations with the National Vision for professional midwifery and relative comparisons within and across disciplinary subgroups. Results Unprompted, physicians, nurses and TBAs were unable to correctly define professional midwifery. Yet, when professional midwifery was defined for them, they expressed willingness to work with PMs, seeing them as a needed human resource, instrumental in providing intercultural care and strengthening facility relationships with TBAs. Some stakeholders anticipated resistance toward PMs due to provider turf issues. Notable differences in expectations among all groups included ideas for supervision of and by the PMs and the PM's role in monitoring women and conducting births in communities alongside TBAs. Conclusions Facilitators to professional midwifery's success include national political will, stakeholders\u00e2\u0080\u0099 uniformity of vision, and the potential for improved intercultural care. Barriers are mostly professional in nature, including impediments to autonomous practice by PMs, hierarchical challenges, and turf issues. A specific road map addressing the identified barriers is needed for professional midwifery to succeed in reducing maternal health disparities in Guatemala. \u00c2\u00a9 2017 Elsevier Ltd",

      "abstract": "Background and purpose: Prolonged electrocardiogram (ECG) monitoring after ischaemic stroke increases the diagnostic yield of paroxysmal atrial fibrillation (pAF). In order to facilitate the additional workload involved in ECG analysis due to prolonged monitoring times, we investigated the effectiveness of pAF detection with an automated software algorithm (SA) in comparison to the routine staff-based analysis (RA) during standard stroke-unit care. Therefore, patients with acute ischaemic stroke or transitory ischaemic attack presenting with sinus rhythmus on the admission ECG and no history of atrial fibrillation were prospectively included. Methods: A 24-h Holter ECG assessment was performed using either RA based on a computer-aided evaluation and subsequent review by a cardiologist or a commercially available automated SA. In the case of discordant results concerning the occurrence of pAF between the two methods, the data underwent an independent external rating. Results: Of 809 prospectively enrolled patients, 580 patients fulfilled the inclusion criteria. pAF was ultimately diagnosed in 3.3% of the cohort (19 patients). SA and RA correctly diagnosed pAF in 17 patients resulting in a comparable diagnostic effectiveness of the analysis methods (sensitivity: SA 89.5% vs. RA 89.5%; specificity: SA 99.3% vs. RA 99.1%; \u00ce\u00ba, 0.686; P < 0.001; 95% confidence interval, 0.525\u00e2\u0080\u00930.847). RA revealed clinically relevant ECG abnormalities in an additional seven patients. Conclusions: Although it should not completely replace RA, SA-based evaluation of Holter ECG reaches a high diagnostic effectiveness for the detection of pAF and can be used for a rapid and resource-saving analysis of ECG data to deal with prolonged monitoring times. \u00c2\u00a9 2017 The Authors.

Most current approaches are based on either batch optimization or Bayesian filter, which require a good initial guess to obtain the optimal calibration results. In this paper, a two-step calibration algorithm is proposed for a fully automatic calibration of the camera-odometry system, consisting of: 1) a non-iterative auto initialization step for spatial extrinsic calibration based on the landmark measurements and 2) a joint optimization step to estimate both the spatio-temporal extrinsic parameters and the odometric parameters. By exploiting the planar constraints of landmark measurements, our auto initialization method can achieve better accuracy compared with the current solutions. Experiments are conducted based on both the simulation data sets and also the real world data sets collected from an autonomous guided vehicle (AGV) system, which validate our algorithm compared with a VO-based non-iterative method. \u00c2\u00a9 2001-2012 IEEE.",

This problem is particularly hard and the scientific community has so far failed to provide a stable and reliable s/p control, effective in daily-life activities. In order to improve the reliability of this form of control, in this paper we propose on-the-fly knowledge composition, thereby reducing the burden of matching several patterns at the same time, and simplifying the task of the system. In particular, we show that using our method it is possible to dynamically compose a model by juxtaposing subsets of previously gathered (sample, target) pairs in real-time, rather than composing a single model in the beginning and then hoping it can reliably distinguish all patterns. Fourteen intact subjects participated in an experiment, where repetitive daily-life tasks (e.g. ironing a cloth) were performed using a commercially available dexterous prosthetic hand mounted on a splint and wirelessly controlled using a machine learning method. During the experiment, the subjects performed these tasks using myocontrol with and without knowledge composition and the results demonstrate that employing knowledge composition allowed better performance, i.e. reducing the overall task completion time by 30%. \u00c2\u00a9 2001-2011 IEEE.",

      "abstract": "Road safety has become more concern due to the number of accidents that keeps increasing every year. The safety systems include from simple installation such as seat belt, airbag, and rear camera to more complicated and intelligent systems such as braking assist, lane change assist, steering control and blind spot monitoring. This paper proposes another intelligent safety system to be implemented in passenger vehicle by monitoring the blind-spot region by using automotive short range radar as sensor to assess its surrounding. This system is called Active Blind-Spot Assist (ABSA) system and this system will collaborate with a Steering Intervention system for autonomous steering maneuvers. The objective of ABSA system is to deploy safety interventions by giving warning to the driver whenever other vehicle is detected within the blind-spot region. Furthermore, this active system also triggers autonomous steering control when the potential of collision with the detected vehicle increases greatly. Consequently, a threat assessment algorithm is developed to evaluate the right moment to give safety interventions to the driver and the conditions for autonomous steering maneuvers. The process of developing the threat assessment algorithm explained in this paper. \u00c2\u00a9 2006-2017 Asian Research Publishing Network (ARPN).",

      "abstract": "Coral reefs play a key role in coastal protection and habitat provision. They are also well known for their recreational value. Attempts to protect these ecosystems have not successfully stopped large-scale degradation. Significant efforts have been made by government and research organizations to ensure that coral reefs are monitored systematically to gain a deeper understanding of the causes, the effects and the extent of threats affecting coral reefs. However, further research is needed to fully understand the importance that sampling design has on coral reef characterization and assessment. This study examines the effect that sampling design has on the estimation of seascape metrics when coupling semi-autonomous underwater vehicles, structure-from-motion photogrammetry techniques and high resolution (0.4 cm) underwater imagery. For this purpose, we use FRAGSTATS v4 to estimate key seascape metrics that enable quantification of the area, density, edge, shape, contagion, interspersion and diversity of sessile organisms for a range of sampling scales (0.5 m \u00d7 0.5 m, 2 m \u00d7 2 m, 5 m \u00d7 5 m, 7 m \u00d7 7 m), quadrat densities (from 1\u2013100 quadrats) and sampling strategies (nested vs. random) within a 1655 m2 case study area in Ponta do Ouro Partial Marine Reserve (Mozambique). Results show that the benthic community is rather disaggregated within a rocky matrix; the embedded patches frequently have a small size and a regular shape; and the population is highly represented by soft corals. The genus Acropora is the more frequent and shows bigger colonies in the group of hard corals. Each of the seascape metrics has specific requirements of the sampling scale and quadrat density for robust estimation. Overall, the majority of the metrics were accurately identified by sampling scales equal to or coarser than 5 m \u00d7 5 m and quadrat densities equal to or larger than 30. The study indicates that special attention needs to be dedicated to the design of coral reef monitoring programmes, with decisions being based on the seascape metrics and statistics being determined. The results presented here are representative of the eastern South Africa coral reefs and are expected to be transferable to coral reefs with similar characteristics. The work presented here is limited to one study site and further research is required to confirm the findings.",

      "abstract": "There has been a strong interest in emergency planning in response to an attack or accidental release of harmful chemical, biological, radiological or nuclear substances. Under such circumstances, it is of paramount importance to determine the location and release rate of the hazardous source to forecast the future harm it may cause and employ methods to minimize the disturbance. In this paper, a sensor data collection strategy is proposed whereby an autonomous mobile sensor is guided to address such a problem with a high degree of accuracy and in a short amount of time. First, the parameters of the release source are estimated using the Markov chain Monte Carlo sampling approach. The most informative manoeuvre from the set of possible choices is then selected using the concept of maximum entropy sampling. Numerical simulations demonstrate the superior performance of the proposed algorithm compared to traditional approaches in terms of estimation accuracy and the number of measurements required. \u00c2\u00a9 2017",

      "abstract": "With the development of aerospace industry, the guidance system of an entry vehicle becomes more robust, reliable and autonomous. Based on fuzzy logic, a predictor\u00e2\u0080\u0093corrector guidance law is proposed in this paper, where the trajectory prediction is realized by numerical integration. The correction system consists of two fuzzy controllers, which correct longitudinal motion and lateral motion synergistically. A drag acceleration profile is designed through interpolating between upper drag boundary and lower drag boundary, which is corrected continually to eliminate the range error. Attack angle, a secondary control variable in the paper, is used to eliminate the altitude error. In addition, the lateral error is removed by regulating the reversal time of bank angle. Compared with the traditional guidance laws, the method in this paper not only can correct synergistically the longitudinal motion and lateral motion of the vehicle, but also can easily cope with the flight constraints using interpolated drag acceleration profile. Moreover, in a correction cycle, the method designed in this paper only needs a single trajectory prediction, which reduces the on-board computation. The guidance law demonstrates a high precision and robustness in the simulation scenario. \u00c2\u00a9 2017 Elsevier Masson SAS",

      "abstract": "Many highway vehicle applications require reliable, high precision navigation (error less than meter level) while using low-cost consumer-grade inertial and global navigation satellite systems (GNSS). The application environment causes numerous GNSS measurement outliers. Common implementations use a single epoch Extended Kalman Filter (EKF) combined with the Receiver Autonomous Integrity Monitoring (RAIM) for GNSS outlier detection. However, if the linearization point of the EKF is incorrect or if the number of residuals is too low, the outlier detection decisions may be incorrect. False alarms result in good information not being incorporated into the state and covariance estimates. Missed detections result in incorrect information being incorporated into the state and covariance estimates. Either case can cause subsequent incorrect decisions, possibly causing divergence, due to the state and covariance now being incorrect. This article formulates a sliding window estimator containing multiple GNSS epochs. The approach solves the full-nonlinear Maximum A Posteriori problem with l1-regularization. By leveraging the resulting window of residuals from the nonlinear optimization, and exploiting the l1-regularization, an improved outlier accommodation strategy is implemented. Experimental sensor data is used to demonstrate the robust sliding window least soft-thresholded squares method and its performance. \u00c2\u00a9 2017",

A novel mechanical model of the contact between the soft fingertip and the grasped object is here presented and supported by both FEM analysis and experimental verification. The proposed algorithm to extract such information from tactile raw data, based on this model, is simple enough to allow implementation of the grasp control strategy on the control hardware embedded into a standard robotic parallel gripper, so as to mimic human reactive grip responses, which occur when the control of an held object appears uncertain. \u00c2\u00a9 2017",

      "abstract": "An autonomous entry guidance is developed for a hypersonic glide vehicle with high Lift-to-Drag ratio (L/D) based on 3-D analytical glide formulas. To compensate the effects of the Earth's rotation, the pseudo-aerodynamic forces are introduced as the fusions of the aerodynamic forces and inertial forces due to the Earth's rotation. To avoid drastic changes in Angle of Attack (AOA) and bank angle, we carefully forecast the change trends of the inertial forces and then design the pseudo-aerodynamic profiles as inversely proportional functions. Here a complex but useful identity is found and proved theoretically, which helps to simplify the pseudo-aerodynamic profiles without losing accuracy significantly. Subsequently, new 3-D analytical glide formulas are derived for these inversely-proportional profiles and then used to determine the profile parameters and bank reversals. Due to the careful design, the guidance is capable of steering the high-L/D vehicle to any place on the Earth accurately while achieving almost constant commands during the steady glide phase, a major phase of flight. The superior performance of the guidance is verified by the Monte Carlo simulations with challenging disturbances including initial state dispersions, aerodynamic uncertainties, and atmospheric perturbations. \u00c2\u00a9 2017 Elsevier Masson SAS",

The key novelty here lies in the sole exploitation of UAV-bound radio measurements as a way to recover the map data, i.e. no image of the city is taken or processed. The proposed approach relies on the unique ability for a UAV-to-ground communication system to detect and classify line-of-sight (LoS) vs. non line-of-sight (NLoS) channels towards ground users using machine learning tools. Once classification is carried out, the LoS vs. NLoS data is fed as input to a building position and height reconstruction algorithm. The map reconstruction quality is analyzed as a function of user density and UAV altitude, revealing the notion of an optimal height for the UAV which is predicted using an analytical model. \u00c2\u00a9 2017 IEEE.",

      "abstract": "Due to the trade-offs between accuracy and speed, binocular stereo vision is still a challenging task in 3D computer vision research area. In this paper, an efficient stereo matching algorithm is implemented on a state-of-the-art GPU to achieve highly accurate disparity maps in real time for various autonomous vehicle applications. The proposed algorithm is developed from our previous paper, where the search range at row v is propagated from three estimated neighbourhood disparities located at row v + 1. In order to speed up the execution, the prevalent NCC algorithm is optimised by factorising the equation into five independent parts. The computations of hi, Hr, aj and ar are accelerated by using the integral images II, Ir, 12 and Ir2. The values of h and a are stored in static program storage for indexing during the stereo matching, which further reduces expensive calculations to help the system perform in real time. The main purpose of this work is to accelerate the processing speed by highly exploiting the parallel computing architectures (OpenMP and CUDA). The performance of the implementation on an NVIDIA GTX 970M GPU is compared with the performance of the implementations on an Intel Core i7-4720HQ CPU using both single thread and multiple threads. The experimental results illustrate that the GPU implementation yields 37 fps when processing the images (resolution: 1242 \u00c3\u0097 375) from the KITTI database, which is between two and nine times faster than the implementations on the CPU using a different number of threads. \u00c2\u00a9 2017 IEEE.",

      "abstract": "One of the main challenges of farming is to prevent pest attacks and reduce the risk of infection. Remote areas and adverse weather are also unfavorable for agriculture. Pesticides and medicines are harmful to human health, as well as in adverse conditions; farming is rugged, risky, and monotonous. It is possible to reduce these problems using robots in agriculture. In this paper, we have proposed an affordable prototype of highly efficient sprayer robot for easy control and maintenance, using some simple technologies based on a microcontroller, ultrasonic sensor, and servo motor. \u00c2\u00a9 2017 IEEE.",
